## Strunk's Core Principles

*From William Strunk Jr.'s "The Elements of Style" (1918)*

### The Big Five (Apply to Every Sentence)

**1. Use Active Voice**
- Passive: "The rule was established by the court"
- Active: "The court established the rule"
- **Why:** Active voice is stronger, clearer, and more direct

**2. Put Statements in Positive Form**
- Negative: "He was not very often on time"
- Positive: "He usually came late"
- **Why:** Positive statements are more definite and assertive

**3. Use Definite, Specific, Concrete Language**
- Vague: "A period of unfavorable weather set in"
- Specific: "It rained every day for a week"
- **Why:** Specific language creates vivid, precise meaning

**4. Omit Needless Words**
- Wordy: "The reason why he wrote the book is unclear"
- Concise: "Why he wrote the book is unclear"
- **Why:** Vigorous writing is concise. Every word should tell.

**5. Keep Related Words Together**
- Confusing: "He noticed a large stain in the rug that was right in the center"
- Clear: "He noticed a large stain right in the center of the rug"
- **Why:** The reader should not have to guess what modifies what

### Supporting Principles

**6. Express Co-ordinate Ideas in Similar Form**
- Use parallel structure for parallel ideas
- "Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method; now, the laboratory method is employed"

**7. Place Emphatic Words at the End**
- Weak: "This world, after all our science and sciences, is still a miracle; wonderful, inscrutable, magical and more, to whomever will think of it"
- Strong: "This world, after all our science and sciences, is still a miracle"

### Paragraph Structure

**8. One Paragraph per Topic**
- Each paragraph should focus on one idea
- Begin with topic sentence
- End in conformity with the beginning

**9. Begin Paragraphs with Topic Sentences**
- Signal the paragraph's purpose immediately
- Develop the topic sentence in subsequent sentences
- Connect paragraphs logically

### Grammar & Punctuation Quick Reference

- Form possessive singular with 's (Charles's, Burns's)
- Use comma after each term in series except last (red, white, and blue)
- Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas
- Comma before conjunction introducing co-ordinate clause
- Don't join independent clauses by comma (use semicolon or period)
- Don't break sentences in two (don't use periods for commas)
- Participial phrase at beginning must refer to grammatical subject

**Full reference:** See `elements-of-style.md` in REFERENCES/ for complete rules and examples.

## Legal Writing Conventions

### IRAC Structure

All legal analysis follows the IRAC framework:

**I - Issue**
- State the legal question clearly
- Frame as a question: "Whether X can Y under Z doctrine"
- Include relevant jurisdictional facts

**R - Rule**
- State the black letter law
- Include statutory citations (MPC §, U.S.C., etc.)
- Number all elements clearly
- Define key terms

**A - Analysis**
- Apply each element to facts
- Use "Here, [fact pattern]... because [reasoning]"
- Consider counterarguments
- Distinguish adverse authority

**C - Conclusion**
- Direct answer to the issue
- Follow logically from analysis
- "Therefore, X CAN/CANNOT Y under Z doctrine"

### Paragraph Structure for Legal Analysis

**Topic Sentence:**
- State the point you're making
- "Under MPC § 2.01, criminal liability requires a voluntary act."

**Explanation:**
- Define the rule
- Explain key terms
- Cite authority

**Application:**
- Apply rule to facts
- "Here, defendant's actions were involuntary because..."

**Concluding Sentence:**
- Tie back to issue
- "Therefore, defendant cannot be held liable."

### Legal Writing Style

**DO:**
- Use precise legal terminology
- Define terms on first use
- Cite authority for propositions
- Use "The court held" not "I think"
- Number elements and arguments
- Use transition words (However, Therefore, Thus)

**DON'T:**
- Use vague language ("it seems", "probably")
- Overuse qualifiers ("very", "really", "quite")
- Write in absolutes without exceptions
- Use idioms or colloquialisms
- Be wordy or repetitive

## Case Brief Format

*From your ConLaw prep documents - standardized format*

Use this format for all case briefs in prep docs:

```markdown
# [Case Name] ([Plaintiff] v. [Defendant]), [Citation] ([Year])

## Rule of Law

[Concise statement of the legal rule or principle]

## Facts + Procedural Posture

1. [First key fact]
2. [Second key fact]
3. [Third key fact - including procedural history]
4. [Current posture - how case reached this court]

## Issue

1. [Primary legal question]
2. [Secondary legal question, if applicable]

## Holding & Reasoning

## ([Justice], J.)

[Yes/No answer]

1. [First point of reasoning]
2. [Second point of reasoning]
   * Sub-point with details
   * Another sub-point
3. [Third point of reasoning]

Disposition: [Result - Affirmed/Reversed/Remanded]

## Dissent

## ([Justice], J.)

1. Bottom line: [Would invalidate/uphold]
2. Rule: [Legal principle dissent would apply]
3. Rationale: [Brief explanation of disagreement]
```

### Case Brief Format Notes

**Rule of Law:** One sentence stating the legal principle. If the case addresses multiple issues, either:
- Write separate briefs for each issue
- Number multiple rules of law (1, 2, 3...)

**Facts + Procedural Posture:** Number each fact chronologically. Include:
- Key facts (who, what, when, where, why)
- Procedural history (lower court rulings)
- Current posture (how case reached this court)

**Issue:** Frame as specific legal questions. Use "whether" phrasing:
- "Whether X constitutes Y under Z statute"
- "Whether the court has jurisdiction to..."

**Holding & Reasoning:**
- Start with direct answer (Yes/No)
- Number reasoning points
- Use sub-bullets for details (marked with *)
- Include legal tests or standards applied

**Disposition:** How the court resolved the case:
- Affirmed (lower court decision stands)
- Reversed (lower court decision overturned)
- Remanded (sent back for further proceedings)

**Dissent:** Only include if dissent is notable or frequently cited
- Bottom line: What dissent would do
- Rule: Legal principle dissent advances
- Rationale: Brief explanation (1-2 sentences)

## AI Guardrails

*From SKILL.md - rules for AI when generating or editing content*

### When to Apply These Standards

Use these writing standards whenever:
- Generating prep documents (audio or text)
- Writing case briefs
- Creating review documents
- Building outline sections
- Drafting prewrite analyses
- Editing any document for clarity

### Limited Context Strategy

When token limits are tight:
1. Write draft using best judgment
2. Dispatch subagent with draft and this guide
3. Have subagent copyedit and return revision

### Core Writing Principles (AI Summary)

**Grammar/Punctuation:**
1. Form possessive singular with 's
2. Use comma after each term in series except last
3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas
4. Comma before conjunction introducing co-ordinate clause
5. Don't join independent clauses by comma
6. Don't break sentences in two
7. Participial phrase at beginning must refer to subject

**Composition:**
8. One paragraph per topic
9. Begin paragraph with topic sentence
10. **Use active voice**
11. **Put statements in positive form**
12. **Use definite, specific, concrete language**
13. **Omit needless words**
14. Avoid succession of loose sentences
15. Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form
16. **Keep related words together**
17. Keep to one tense in summaries
18. **Place emphatic words at end**

### AI Behavior Rules

**DO:**
- Read this guide before writing prose
- Apply all rules consistently
- Edit drafts to meet these standards
- Dispatch subagent for copyediting when context is limited
- Reference case brief format for all case briefs

**DON'T:**
- Generate prose without applying these rules
- Use passive voice unnecessarily
- Be wordy or vague
- Skip editing step
- Ignore formatting standards

**Bold:** Key terms, definitions, emphasis
*Italic:* Case names, legal terms (first use), emphasis
`Code`: Citations, statute references

### Lists

**Numbered lists:** Use for:
- Elements
- Steps in a process
- Sequential items
- Facts in case briefs

**Bulleted lists:** Use for:
- Examples
- Non-sequential points
- General information

**Nested lists:**
```markdown
1. Main point
   * Sub-point
   * Another sub-point
2. Next main point
```

### Citations

**Statutes:**
- MPC § 2.01(1)
- 42 U.S.C. § 1983

**Cases:**
- *Brown v. Board of Education*, 347 U.S. 483 (1954)

**In-text:**
- "Under MPC § 2.01..." (first mention)
- "Under § 2.01..." (subsequent mentions in same doc)

### Numbering

**Elements:** Always number
```
1. Actus reus: [definition]
2. Mens rea: [definition]
3. Concurrence: [definition]
```

**Tests:** Number factors
```
The court applies three factors:
1. [Factor 1]
2. [Factor 2]
3. [Factor 3]
```

### Spacing

- One blank line between paragraphs
- No blank lines within lists
- One blank line after headings
- Two blank lines before major section breaks

### Capitalization

**Capitalize:**
- Actus Reus, Mens Rea (when referring to the doctrine)
- Constitution, Fourteenth Amendment
- Court (when referring to specific court: "the Court held")
- Party names in case names: *Plaintiff v. Defendant*

**Lowercase:**
