# The Slaughter-House Cases (Butchers’ Benevolent Ass’n of New Orleans (plaintiff) v. Crescent City Livestock Landing & Slaughter-House Co. (defendant)), 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36, 21 L. Ed. 394 (1873)

## Rule of Law

The Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only rights of national citizenship, not state citizenship; states may, under their police power, impose reasonable health-and-safety limits on private trades.

## Facts + Procedural Posture

1. New Orleans suffered disease outbreaks linked to slaughterhouse waste in its water supply.
2. Louisiana chartered Crescent City with an exclusive right to operate centralized slaughter facilities; all butchers had to use them for a fee.
3. The Butchers’ Association alleged violations of the Thirteenth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities, Due Process, and Equal Protection Clauses.
4. The Louisiana Supreme Court upheld the statute; the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari and affirmed.

## Issue

1. Can a state, under its police power, restrict the manner and place of slaughtering to protect public health?
2. Does the Privileges or Immunities Clause protect only rights tied to U.S. citizenship, not rights of state citizenship such as practicing a trade?

## Holding & Reasoning

## (Miller, J.)

Yes to both.

1. Police Power: States may limit harmful or noxious trades to safeguard health and welfare. Centralizing slaughtering away from the water supply is a classic, permissible health measure.
2. Privileges or Immunities (P/I):

   * Scope: P/I secures only rights incident to national citizenship (e.g., access to federal institutions, protection on the high seas), not general civil rights derived from state citizenship.
   * Trade Right: The right to pursue a calling is a matter of state citizenship; the P/I Clause does not protect it from state regulation.
3. Thirteenth Amendment: “Servitude” there targets conditions akin to African slavery, not economic regulation requiring use of a licensed facility.
4. Due Process: No deprivation of “property” in the constitutional sense by regulating where slaughtering occurs; the law is a general health measure.
5. Equal Protection: Adopted against the backdrop of race-based oppression; a neutral health regulation not aimed at a racial class does not violate it.

Disposition:Affirmed.

## Dissent

## (Field, Bradley, Swayne, joined in parts by Chase)

1. Bottom line: Would invalidate the monopoly.
2. Rule: P/I protects fundamental rights of citizens, including the right to pursue a lawful occupation free from arbitrary monopolies; the Fourteenth Amendment limits state power more broadly than the majority allows.
3. Rationale (brief):

   * (a) A state-created exclusive franchise deprives butchers of a common calling.
   * (b) The majority’s narrow reading renders the P/I Clause largely toothless against state abridgments of basic civil rights.
   * (c) Due Process guards against arbitrary deprivations of liberty to work; this monopoly crosses that line.

Equal Protection

# Strauder v. West Virginia , 100 U.S. 303 (1880)

## Rule of Law

The Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause forbids states from enacting laws that discriminate on the basis of race, including categorical exclusion of Black citizens from jury service.

## Facts + Procedural Posture

1. West Virginia (plaintiff) enacted a statute limiting jury service to White males over 21 who were state citizens.
2. Strauder (defendant), a Black man, was convicted of murder by an all-White jury selected under that statute.
3. Strauder argued the conviction violated the Fourteenth Amendment.
4. The United States Supreme Court reviewed the conviction and the statute’s validity.

## Issue

Is a state statute restricting jury service to White persons constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment?

## Holding & Reasoning

## (Strong, J.)

No.

1. Purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment: Adopted to secure equal civil rights for formerly enslaved persons and to prevent state-sponsored racial discrimination.
2. Equal Protection: States may not, by law, single out a race for exclusion from civil functions such as jury service; doing so brands the excluded class as inferior and denies equal justice.
3. Permissible Qualifications: States may set nonracial juror qualifications (e.g., sex, citizenship, age, education, property), but race-based exclusions are unconstitutional.
4. Application: West Virginia’s whites-only jury statute is a prohibited discrimination, so a conviction secured under that regime cannot stand.

Disposition:Reversed (statute unconstitutional; conviction obtained under it invalid).

## Dissent

## (Field, J.)

1. Bottom line: Would not invalidate under the Fourteenth Amendment.
2. Rule/Theory: The Amendments did not authorize federal displacement of state control over local matters like juror selection; concerns also about vagueness in related federal enforcement (per his Ex parte Virginia dissent).
3. Rationale (brief): Federal overreach into state prerogatives; indictment/enforcement must specify qualified excluded persons to be valid.

# Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896)

## Rule of Law

State‐mandated racial segregation in public accommodations does not violate the Equal Protection Clause if facilities are “separate but equal.”

## Facts + Procedural Posture

1. Louisiana’s 1890 Separate Car Act required separate rail cars for White and Black passengers.
2. Plessy (petitioner/defendant), seven-eighths White and one-eighth Black under Louisiana law, sat in a White car, was arrested, and convicted.
3. Judge Ferguson (respondent/judge) upheld the law; the Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed.
4. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari and reviewed the statute and conviction.

## Issue

May a state require racially separate railway cars without violating the Fourteenth Amendment?

## Holding & Reasoning

## (Brown, J.)

Yes.

1. Fourteenth Amendment scope: Ensures legal equality, not enforced social commingling.
2. No inferiority implied: Separation does not by itself denote racial inferiority; any sense of stigma is attributed to the affected group’s interpretation.
3. Police power: States may regulate railroads operating intrastate for public order and comfort.
4. Separate but equal: If civil and political rights are equally protected and facilities are equal, classification by race is permissible.

   Disposition:Affirmed (statute and conviction upheld).

## Dissent

## (Harlan, J.)

1. Bottom line: Would invalidate the law.
2. Rule: The Constitution is color-blind; civil rights may not turn on race.
3. Rationale: The statute imposes a badge of servitude and contradicts equal citizenship; the majority repeats the error of Dred Scott and will be repudiated.

# Brown v. Board of Education (Brown I), 347 U.S. 483 (1954)

## Rule of Law

Racially separate public schools are inherently unequal and violate the Equal Protection Clause.

## Facts + Procedural Posture

1. Consolidated cases from KS, SC, VA, DE. Black children (plaintiffs) were denied admission to White public schools under segregation laws; school boards (defendants) prevailed below (except DE ordered admission based on inequality).
2. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide whether segregation itself is unconstitutional.

## Issue

Does state-mandated racial segregation in public schools deny equal protection even if tangible factors are otherwise equal?

## Holding & Reasoning (Warren, C.J.)

Yes.

1. Original intent inconclusive; education’s modern role is central to citizenship and opportunity.
2. Equal terms required: when a state provides schooling, it must offer it equally.
3. Intangible harms: segregation generates a sense of inferiority that undermines educational outcomes; separate schools are inherently unequal.
4. Plessy limited/repudiated in the school context.

   Disposition:Reversed (KS, SC, VA); Affirmed (DE); remanded for remedies to be set.

# Brown v. Board of Education (Brown II), 349 U.S. 294 (1955)

## Rule of Law

Public schools must desegregate “with all deliberate speed,” under district-court supervision applying equitable principles.

## Facts + Procedural Posture

1. After Brown I declared segregation unconstitutional, the Court requested guidance on remedies.
2. School boards (defendants) and plaintiffs returned on reargument; implementation standards were unresolved.

## Issue

What remedy and timetable govern dismantling school segregation declared unconstitutional in Brown I?

## Holding & Reasoning (Warren, C.J.)

Desegregation required with all deliberate speed.

1. Primary duty: Local school authorities must promptly submit and implement good-faith desegregation plans.
2. Judicial oversight:District courts retain jurisdiction and evaluate progress using equity, considering practical problems but not tolerating unnecessary delay.
3. Standards: Require a prompt and reasonable start, specific steps (e.g., pupil assignment, facilities, transportation, personnel), and continuing reports.

   Disposition:Remanded to district courts to enforce and supervise compliance.

# Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944)

## Rule of Law

Racial classifications by government are inherently suspect and require strict scrutiny; a law survives only if justified by a pressing public necessity, not racial antagonism.

## Facts + Procedural Posture

1. WWII. Executive Order 9066 authorized military exclusion zones.
2. Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34 barred all persons of Japanese ancestry from a West Coast military area.
3. Fred Korematsu (petitioner/defendant) remained in the area; convicted for violating the exclusion.
4. Ninth Circuit affirmed; U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari.

## Issue

Does excluding all persons of Japanese ancestry from a military area satisfy the Equal Protection limits (via the Fifth Amendment’s due process) under strict scrutiny?

## Holding & Reasoning (Black, J.)

Yes. Conviction affirmed.

1. Strict scrutiny acknowledged: Racial laws are suspect and require the “most rigid scrutiny.”
2. Compelling aim: Preventing wartime espionage and sabotage is a pressing public necessity.
3. Means–end fit (as seen by Court): Military judged exclusion, not merely curfew, necessary; individual loyalty hearings deemed impracticable during war.
4. Scope limited: Court treats exclusion as distinct from later detention; only exclusion is before it.
5. Precedent: Relies on Hirabayashi upholding a race-based curfew in wartime.

Disposition:Affirmed (exclusion order constitutional as applied).

## Concurrence (Frankfurter, J.)

War powers allow Congress and the Executive to adopt exclusion measures that are necessary to wage war; constitutionality judged in wartime context.

## Dissents

1. Jackson, J.: The order is clearly unconstitutional; courts should not ratify military expedients that conflict with constitutional guarantees.
2. Murphy, J.: Measure is rooted in racism; no immediate and impending danger justifies mass exclusion without individualized findings.
3. Roberts, J.: Creates an impossible legal bind and violates due process; wholesale exclusion of loyal citizens cannot stand.

---

Subsequent history / modern view: Conviction vacated on coram nobis, Korematsu v. United States, 584 F. Supp. 1406 (N.D. Cal. 1984) (government misconduct). Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2423 (2018) states Korematsu was “gravely wrong” and has no place in law.

1. Segregation’s purpose and lineage
2. It descends from slavery and Dred Scott and functions to maintain white supremacy.
3. It is not “mutual separation” but a caste system: whites enjoy full civic life; Blacks are excluded.
4. “Separate but equal” is a fiction; persistent inferiority of Black facilities evidences intent and effect.
5. Segregation coexists with, and depends on, broader discrimination: disenfranchisement, “unwritten law,” humiliation norms.
6. Courts should recognize these as common social facts; refusal to look past facial neutrality is willful blindness.
7. Judicial posture pre-Brown
8. Post-1877 “compromise”: Strauder struck explicit race bars; Plessy upheld facially neutral segregation by ignoring real inequality.
9. Plessy was reaffirmed and extended (Gong Lum; Cumming; Berea College).
10. Buchanan v. Warley is an outlier explained by property/economic due process, not racial equality.
11. Disenfranchisement machinery and politics
12. 1890–1908 Southern constitutions and statutes systematically eliminated Black voting through devices beyond overt Fifteenth Amendment violations.
13. Republican realignment reduced federal will to protect Black suffrage, enabling one-party white rule.
14. Result: catastrophic drops in Black registration and turnout across Southern states.
15. Giles v. Harris (1903) takeaway
16. Holmes, J.: Courts lack practical capacity to remedy statewide conspiracies to disenfranchise; relief must come from political branches.
17. Effect: judicial inaction legitimated and entrenched the disenfranchisement regime.
18. Net thesis for notes
19. Segregation’s social meaning = enforced Black inferiority; courts’ adherence to facial neutrality and institutional limits sustained it until later political-judicial shifts.
