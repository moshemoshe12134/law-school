# 05_ARCHIVE - Obsolete Documents

**Purpose:** Contains obsolete documents that have been replaced by new system components but are kept for historical reference.

## What Goes Here

### Planning Documents
- `_HOUSEKEEPING_REPORT_2025-10-24.md` - Previous system cleanup report
- `ADMIN_CLEANUP_PLAN.md` - Admin cleanup planning
- `SYSTEM_DIAGNOSIS_2026-01-19.md` - System analysis (completed)
- `STRUCTURE_DESIGN_EXPLORATION.md` - Design exploration notes
- `OPTIMIZATION_QUEUE.md` - Optimization task queue

### Replaced Documents
- `POST_CLASS_TRANSCRIPT_WORKFLOW_📋.md` - Merged into unified workflows

### Working Documents
- `REORG_TRACKER.md` - Reorganization tracking (move here when complete)

## What Does NOT Go Here

❌ **DO NOT ARCHIVE:**
- `elements-of-style.md` - Moved to `02_STYLE_GUIDES/REFERENCES/`
- `_PREP_FORMAT_EXAMPLE.md` - Moved to `02_STYLE_GUIDES/REFERENCES/`
- `SKILL.md` - Integrated into `WRITING_FOUNDATIONS.md`
- `echo360_transcript_guide.md` - Moved to `01_WORKFLOWS/REFERENCES/`

## Archive Principles

1. **Archive after replacement** - Only move files here after their replacement is confirmed working
2. **Keep for reference** - Don't delete immediately - you may need to reference old formats
3. **Organize by date** - Consider adding date prefixes to make sorting easier
4. **Compress old files** - Very old files can be zipped to save space

## Cleanup Schedule

- **After 1 semester:** Review archive, delete clearly obsolete files
- **After 1 year:** Compress all files older than 1 year into `.zip` archives
- **Before exams:** Never clean archive during exam prep period

## Current Status

This folder is empty at the start of reorganization. Files will be moved here as Phase 1.6 completes.
