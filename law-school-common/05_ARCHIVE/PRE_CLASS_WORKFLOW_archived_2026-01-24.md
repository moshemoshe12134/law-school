# PRE_CLASS WORKFLOW [ARCHIVED 2026-01-24]

**ARCHIVED:** This version was replaced on 2026-01-24 with exam-first strategy.  
**Reason:** Shifted from comprehensive class prep to minimal "index card" prep + post-class review focus.  
**See:** `EXAM_FIRST_CLASS_PREP_STRATEGY.md` in CrimLaw/00_ADMIN for new approach.

# PRE_CLASS WORKFLOW

**Purpose:** Generate audio and text preps before each class to prepare for Socratic dialogue and class participation.

---

## Overview

**Goal:** Walk into each class able to:
- Answer cold calls confidently (even without doing the reading)
- Track professor's "moves" (doctrinal parsing + policy/theory)
- Convert class time into exam-ready material

**Deliverables per class:**
1. **Audio prep** (`02_PREP/audio/YYYY-MM-DD_classNN_audio.md`) - TTS-friendly, conversational
2. **Text prep** (`02_PREP/text/YYYY-MM-DD_classNN_text.md`) - Comprehensive, searchable

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Gather Source Materials (5 min)

**Required inputs:**
- [ ] Syllabus assignment: `01_SOURCES/syllabus/assignments/YYYY-MM-DD_classNN.md`
- [ ] **INDEX FILES (read these first for efficiency):**
  - [ ] `01_SOURCES/past_outlines/INDEX.md` → Look up current topic → get recommended outline file + line range
  - [ ] `01_SOURCES/past_exams/INDEX.md` → Look up current topic → see which exams tested it + model answers
- [ ] Exam spec: `00_ADMIN/exam_spec.md`
- [ ] Assigned cases/statutes (from casebook or supplements)

**How to use INDEX files:**
1. Identify topic from assignment (e.g., "actus reus", "mens rea", "felony murder")
2. Look up topic in `past_outlines/INDEX.md` → get file + line numbers
3. Read ONLY those lines from the recommended outline (avoid reading entire files)
4. Look up topic in `past_exams/INDEX.md` → note which years tested it, which have model answers
5. If model answers exist, prioritize reading those for exam patterns

**Source priority (when things conflict):**
1. Professor statements / class notes (once you have them)
2. Assigned primary law (cases/statutes/text)
3. Syllabus assignment block (what's "in scope")
4. Past outlines (via INDEX — targeted reads only)
5. Treatises/summaries (as scaffolding)

---

### Step 2: Generate Text Prep (First - Creates Source of Truth)

**Template:** `03_TEMPLATES/text_prep_template.md`

**File location:** `02_PREP/text/YYYY-MM-DD_classNN_text.md`

**Process:**

1. **Read assignment** from syllabus
2. **Read past outlines** to understand prior treatment of topic
3. **Check exam spec** for this topic:
   - How has professor tested this topic in past exams?
   - What questions commonly appear?
   - What mistakes do students make?
4. **Check syllabus's special prompts** for this class:
   - Are there explicit "prepare to discuss" questions?
   - Are there visualization/mapping exercises?
   - Are there policy/theory questions flagged?
5. **Generate text prep** with:
   - Book navigation (casebook pages + MPC/statute targets + read-aloud excerpts)
   - Core doctrine (rule statements + elements)
   - Definitions to have ready (statutory + doctrinal terms)
   - Expected professor questions (Q&A format)
   - Case briefs (using standard format)
   - Policy/theory section
   - Quick hypos (5+ with both-side arguments)
   - Search terms
   - **Exam signals** (past questions + common mistakes)
   - **Professor's special prompts** (if syllabus highlights any)

**Quality check:**
- [ ] All sections present (QUICK NAVIGATION, BOOK NAVIGATION, CORE DOCTRINE, DEFINITIONS, EXPECTED QUESTIONS, CASE BRIEFS, POLICY/THEORY, QUICK HYPOS, SEARCH TERMS)
- [ ] Rule statements are copy-ready
- [ ] Cases follow standard brief format
- [ ] At least 5 hypos with both-side arguments
- [ ] Missing sources explicitly flagged

---

### Step 3: Generate Audio Prep (From Text Prep)

**Template:** `03_TEMPLATES/audio_prep_template.md`

**File location:** `02_PREP/audio/YYYY-MM-DD_classNN_audio.md`

**Process:**

1. **Transform text prep** into narrative, conversational format
2. **Focus on:**
   - Central question of the day
   - Minimal doctrine needed to speak in class
   - 5-10 cold-call prompts with answer starters
   - 2-3 tiny hypos
   - Stories and examples (not dense doctrine)

**Quality check:**
- [ ] Conversational tone (not overly formal)
- [ ] Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences max for TTS)
- [ ] No tables (TTS struggles)
- [ ] Time estimates per section
- [ ] Word count 4,000-5,000 (25-30 min at 1.5x)
- [ ] Cold-call questions have answer starters

**Alternative (when time-crunched):**
- Generate audio prep first (minimum viable)
- Generate text prep later (same day/weekend)
- Patch audio if needed after text prep is done

---

### Step 4: Update MASTER_LOG

**In `00_ADMIN/MASTER_LOG.md`:**

- [ ] Mark `Prep Status` as "Done"
- [ ] Mark `Audio?` as ✅
- [ ] Update `Next Action` to "Attend class"

---

## Daily Operating Procedure (Minimal Time, No Reading)

### Before Class (15-25 minutes total)

1. **Listen to audio prep** at 1.5x-2.0x speed
2. **Skim Quick Navigation** section of text prep (so you know what to search)

### During Class

1. **Keep text prep open** - search it when called on
2. **Capture only "deltas"** - what professor emphasized, corrected, or reframed
3. **Note exam signals** - explicit or implicit hints about what's testable

---

## Quality Control

**Before marking prep as complete:**

**Audio prep:**
- [ ] Conversational, TTS-friendly formatting
- [ ] Time estimates add to ~25-30 minutes
- [ ] Explicit cold-call questions with answer starters
- [ ] No dense doctrine (save for text prep)

**Text prep:**
- [ ] Quick navigation exists
- [ ] Q&A blocks for predicted questions
- [ ] Case briefs follow standard format
- [ ] ≥5 hypos with both-side arguments
- [ ] Clear flags for missing sources (no silent guessing)

---

## When to Start Each Prep

**Ideal timing:**
- **Day before class:** Generate text prep
- **Morning of class:** Generate audio prep from text prep
- **1-2 hours before class:** Listen to audio prep + skim text prep

**Minimum viable (time-crunched):**
- **Morning of class:** Generate audio prep only
- **After class:** Generate text prep when you have time
- **Before next class:** Audio prep exists for every class

---

## Templates and References

**Templates:**
- `03_TEMPLATES/audio_prep_template.md`
- `03_TEMPLATES/text_prep_template.md`
- `03_TEMPLATES/qc_checklist_template.md`

**Style guides:**
- `02_STYLE_GUIDES/WRITING_FOUNDATIONS.md` (universal standards)
- `00_ADMIN/course_style_guide.md` (course-specific)

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Missing supplement PDFs
**Solution:** Flag explicitly in text prep - "Supplement X not available, relying on past outlines"

**Issue:** Too much content for audio prep
**Solution:** Focus on central question + cold-call prep - move dense doctrine to text prep

**Issue:** Don't know what professor will ask
**Solution:** Use past outlines + exam spec to predict likely questions - include both plausible answers

**Issue:** Running out of time
**Solution:** Audio prep first (minimum viable) - text prep can wait until after class
