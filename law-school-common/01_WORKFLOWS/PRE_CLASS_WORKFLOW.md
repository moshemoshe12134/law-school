# PRE_CLASS WORKFLOW [EXAM-FIRST EDITION]

**Updated:** 2026-01-24 (Exam-first strategy implemented)  
**Purpose:** Minimal class prep (10-15 min) focused on statute + prosecution/defense arguments. Past outline is your safety net.

**See also:** `ACTIVE/CrimLaw/00_ADMIN/EXAM_FIRST_CLASS_PREP_STRATEGY.md` for full philosophy

---

## Philosophy Change

**Old approach:** Comprehensive prep trying to predict all cold calls  
**New approach:** "Index card" prep with statute + 2-3 arguments per side

**Why:** Harcourt's pattern (from 3 classes analyzed):
- Asks "What does statute say?" → You read text aloud
- Asks "What would prosecution argue?" → Give strongest argument + MPC cite
- Asks "Defense counsel respond" → Flip the argument

**Your safety net:** Past outline open during class for CTRL+F lookup when stuck.

---

## Minimum Viable Prep (10-15 min)

### Goal

Produce a **1-page "index card"** with:
1. Statute/rule text (verbatim)
2. 2-3 prosecution arguments
3. 2-3 defense arguments
4. 1-sentence policy hook
5. Past outline reference for in-class lookup
6. **Case list with court identifiers (for Quimbee prep)**

### Deliverables

**Text prep ONLY:** `02_PREP/text/YYYY-MM-DD_classNN_text.md`
- Target: 500-800 words
- Student reads in 10 minutes
- Searchable during class

**Audio prep:** Optional/as-needed basis only

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Gather Source Materials (2-3 min)

**Required inputs:**
- [ ] Syllabus assignment file: `01_SOURCES/syllabus/assignments/YYYY-MM-DD_classNN.md` → **Check for professor questions/comments**
- [ ] Syllabus page assignments: `01_SOURCES/syllabus/KSSB10_Assigned_Pages.md`
- [ ] Past outline INDEX: `01_SOURCES/past_outlines/INDEX.md` → Look up topic
- [ ] Exam spec: `00_ADMIN/exam_spec.md` (what has been tested before)

**How to use sources:**
1. Look up topic in `past_outlines/INDEX.md` → Get specific file + line numbers
2. Read ONLY those lines (don't read entire outline files)
3. Check `KSSB10_Assigned_Pages.md` for case list with court identifiers
4. **CRITICAL:** Check syllabus assignment file for professor questions, comments, or instructions

---

### Step 2: Generate "Index Card" Text Prep (8-10 min)

**Template:** Simplified structure below

**File location:** `02_PREP/text/YYYY-MM-DD_classNN_text.md`

**Required sections:**

#### 0. PROFESSOR QUESTIONS/INSTRUCTIONS (if any in syllabus)

**CRITICAL:** If the syllabus assignment includes any questions, comments, or instructions from the professor, create a dedicated section addressing them directly.

```markdown
## PROFESSOR'S QUESTIONS/INSTRUCTIONS

**From syllabus:** [Quote the exact question/instruction/comment]

**Response:**
[Provide a direct, thoughtful answer or approach to the professor's question]
[If it's a multi-part question, address each part]
[Use specific references to statute/MPC sections or case law]

---
```

**Examples:**
- If professor asks "What are the element requirements necessary to convict?", list them with statutory references
- If professor asks "What does it mean for a legal code to reveal something about our culture?", provide a substantive response with examples
- If professor instructs "Write a jury instruction", draft one

#### 1. CASES FOR TODAY (with Quimbee identifiers)

```markdown
## CASES FOR TODAY

**For Quimbee prep:** Watch these case videos before class

- **[Case Name]** ([Court], [Year]) — [1-sentence what it's about]
  - Quimbee search: "[Case Name] [Court]" or "[Citation]"
  - KSSB10 pages: [page range]
  
[Repeat for each case in today's assignment]
```

**Why court identifiers:** Prevents Quimbee confusion (e.g., "Smith v. Jones" is too generic)

**Include:**
- Full case name (as it appears in casebook)
- Court (e.g., "Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals", "U.S. Supreme Court", "English Court of Appeal")
- Year
- 1-sentence topic description
- KSSB10 page range

#### 2. STATUTE/RULE BLOCK

```markdown
## STATUTE/RULE

[Copy EXACT text of statute/MPC section Harcourt will focus on]

**Elements (parsed):**
- **Conduct:** [identify verbs]
- **Attendant circumstances:** [identify conditions]
- **Result:** [if any]
```

#### 3. PROSECUTION ARGUMENTS (2-3 max)

```markdown
## PROSECUTION ARGUMENTS

1. [Strongest argument + MPC cite]
2. [Time-frame expansion if applicable]
3. [Alternative framing]
```

#### 4. DEFENSE ARGUMENTS (2-3 max)

```markdown
## DEFENSE ARGUMENTS

1. [Best counter + MPC cite]
2. [Time-frame narrowing if applicable]
3. [Voluntariness/mens rea challenge]
```

#### 5. POLICY HOOK (1-2 sentences)

```markdown
## POLICY HOOK

[How does this connect to Harcourt's themes: power, race, incarceration, Foucault, Kelman]
```

#### 6. PAST OUTLINE REFERENCE

```markdown
## IN-CLASS LOOKUP REFERENCE

**Past outline:** [filename] (lines [X-Y])
**Topic in INDEX:** [topic name]
```

**Process:**
1. Read syllabus assignment file (`01_SOURCES/syllabus/assignments/YYYY-MM-DD_classNN.md`)
2. **If professor includes questions/instructions, address them first in a dedicated section**
3. Extract case list with court/year from `KSSB10_Assigned_Pages.md`
4. Identify the ONE statute/rule Harcourt will focus on
5. Draft 2-3 prosecution arguments (with MPC cites)
6. Draft 2-3 defense arguments (with MPC cites)
7. Write 1-sentence policy connection
7. Note past outline reference for lookup

**What to SKIP:**
- ❌ Detailed case briefs
- ❌ Comprehensive doctrine summaries
- ❌ Every possible cold call prediction
- ❌ Abstract policy discussions

---

### Step 3: Update MASTER_LOG

**In `00_ADMIN/MASTER_LOG.md`:**

- [ ] Mark `Prep Status` as "Done"
- [ ] Update `Next Action` to "Attend class"


---

## Daily Operating Procedure

### Before Class (10-15 min total)

1. **Watch Quimbee videos** for cases listed in prep (5-7 min)
2. **Read index card prep** (3 min)
3. **Skim past outline section** noted in prep (2-3 min)

### During Class

1. **Keep text prep + past outline open** - search when called on
2. **Note what Harcourt actually emphasizes** - for post-class review

**What to have ready if cold-called:**
- Read statute aloud (you have exact text)
- State prosecution's strongest argument
- Flip to defense counter-argument

---

## Quality Control

**Before marking prep as complete:**

**Text prep checklist:**
- [ ] Case list with court identifiers (for accurate Quimbee lookup)
- [ ] Statute/rule text (verbatim, with elements parsed)
- [ ] 2-3 prosecution arguments with MPC cites
- [ ] 2-3 defense arguments with MPC cites
- [ ] 1-sentence policy hook
- [ ] Past outline reference (file + lines)
- [ ] Word count: 500-800 words MAX
- [ ] Readable in 10 minutes

**What NOT to include:**
- ❌ Detailed case briefs with procedural history
- ❌ Comprehensive doctrine (that's what outline is for)
- ❌ Multiple hypos (save for post-class review)
- ❌ Extended policy analysis

## Example: Class 2 Index Card Prep

```markdown
# Class 02 Prep — Actus Reus

**Thursday, 2026-01-22**

---

## CASES FOR TODAY

**For Quimbee prep:** Watch these before class

- **Martin v. State** (Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, 1944) — Involuntary appearance in public
  - Quimbee search: "Martin v State Alabama" or "17 So.2d 427"
  - KSSB10 pages: 221-228

- **People v. Newton** (California Court of Appeal, 1970) — Unconsciousness defense
  - Quimbee search: "People v Newton California 1970" 
  - KSSB10 pages: 221-228

- **People v. Decina** (New York Court of Appeals, 1956) — Epileptic seizure while driving
  - Quimbee search: "People v Decina New York"
  - KSSB10 page: 231

---

## STATUTE/RULE

**Alabama Code §120 (1940):**
"Any person who, while intoxicated or drunk, appears in any public place where one or more persons are present, and manifests a drunken condition by boisterous or indecent conduct, or loud and profane discourse, shall, on conviction, be fined..."

**Elements (parsed):**
- **Conduct #1:** "appears" in public place
- **Conduct #2:** "manifests" by boisterous/indecent conduct or loud/profane discourse
- **Attendant circumstance:** intoxicated/drunk
- **Result:** none

---

## PROSECUTION ARGUMENTS

1. **Boisterousness was voluntary** — MPC 2.01 only requires *a* voluntary act. The boisterous conduct in public satisfies this. Intoxication is not a defense.

2. **Time-frame expansion** — Even if appearance was involuntary, he voluntarily drank earlier. Causation argument: drinking led to public drunkenness.

3. **Plain reading** — Statute doesn't require voluntary appearance. Only requires manifestation of drunkenness, which he did voluntarily.

---

## DEFENSE ARGUMENTS

1. **Appearance involuntary** — He was arrested at home and coercively taken outside by police. He never voluntarily appeared in public. No voluntary act for "appearing."

2. **Intoxication negates voluntariness** — Boisterousness was result of intoxication, not voluntary choice. MPC 2.01(3): involuntary acts include those "not a product of effort or determination."

3. **Spirit of law** — Statute targets people who voluntarily go into public and cause nuisance. Police dragging someone from home wasn't contemplated.

---

## POLICY HOOK

Connects to Harcourt's theme of police power and criminalization. State can convert private conduct (drinking at home) into public crime through arrest itself.

---

## IN-CLASS LOOKUP REFERENCE

**Past outline:** `Crim_Spring 2025_Harcourt_Full.docx.md` (lines 450-520)
**Topic in INDEX:** ACTUS REUS (Section 1)
