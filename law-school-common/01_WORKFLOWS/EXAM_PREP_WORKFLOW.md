# EXAM_PREP WORKFLOW

**Purpose:** Build prewrites throughout the semester, not last-minute before exam.

---

## Overview

**Core insight:** Your best exam performance comes from prewrites built progressively, not cramming.

**Goal:** By exam week, have a library of copy-paste ready IRAC analyses and policy arguments.

**Deliverables:**
- Doctrinal prewrites (`06_PREWRITES/DOCTRINAL/[doctrine]_analysis.md`)
- Policy prewrites (`06_PREWRITES/POLICY/[topic].md`)

---

## Workflow: Building Prewrites Throughout Semester

### Weeks 1-2: Foundation

**After each class:**
- Identify 1-2 testable doctrines from class
- Create skeleton prewrites (issue, rule, structure)

**Templates:**
- `03_TEMPLATES/prewrite_doctrinal_template.md`
- `03_TEMPLATES/prewrite_policy_template.md`

**Focus:** Get the structure right - issue, rule, application framework

---

### Weeks 3-8: Ongoing Build

**After each class:**
1. **Identify testable doctrines**
   - What has clear elements?
   - What professor spent time on?
   - What appeared in hypos?

2. **Flesh out prewrites**
   - Add complete rule statements
   - Build application frameworks
   - Add examples from class hypos

3. **Track in MASTER_LOG**
   - Mark `Doctrinal?` as ✅ when prewrite exists
   - Mark `Policy?` as ✅ when policy prewrite exists

**Weekly check:**
- [ ] At least 2 new doctrinal prewrites
- [ ] At least 1 new policy prewrite
- [ ] All prewrites from this week updated

---

### Weeks 9-12: Refinement

**After each class:**
- Refine prewrites with professor's emphasis
- Add examples from class hypos
- Test prewrites on practice questions

**Identify gaps:**
- Which doctrines lack prewrites?
- Which policy arguments need development?
- What past exam topics aren't covered?

---

### Weeks 13-14: Exam Prep

**Drill prewrites:**
- Practice applying prewrites under time pressure
- Memorize issue/rule statements
- Drill fill-in-the-blank application

**Test on past exams:**
- Use past exam questions
- Apply prewrites to fact patterns
- Identify gaps and add variations

**Create exam-day folder:**
- Copy all prewrites to `99_EXAM_DAY/`
- Create attack outline
- Create quick reference documents

---

## Prewrite Structure

### Doctrinal Prewrite

**Template:** `03_TEMPLATES/prewrite_doctrinal_template.md`

**Structure:**
```markdown
# [Doctrine Name] Analysis

## PREWRITE (Copy-Paste Ready)

**Issue:** Whether [party] can [claim/defense] under [doctrine].

**Rule:** [Complete rule with elements]

**Application:**
Here, [party] DOES/DOES NOT satisfy element 1 because [FACTS].
Element 2 IS/IS NOT met because [FACTS].
[Continue for all elements]

**Conclusion:** Therefore, [party] CAN/CANNOT [claim/defense].

## TRIGGERS
[When to use this analysis]

## FRAMEWORK
[Element-by-element breakdown]

## EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS
[2-3 worked examples]
```

**When to create:**
- After class covers that doctrine
- When reviewing for midterm
- When working through past exam questions

---

### Policy Prewrite

**Template:** `03_TEMPLATES/prewrite_policy_template.md`

**Structure:**
```markdown
# [Policy Issue Name]

## OVERVIEW
[One-paragraph description of debate]

## POSITIONS

### Position A: [Name]
**Core Thesis:** [One sentence]
**Key Arguments:** [2-3 arguments]
**Exam-Ready Paragraph:** [Copy-paste ready]

### Position B: [Name]
[Same structure]

## SYNTHESES
[If applicable - middle ground]

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
[Table comparing positions]

## PROFESSOR'S ANGLE
[What professor rewards/emphasizes]
```

**When to create:**
- After class covers policy topic
- When professor rewards policy arguments
- When past exams show policy emphasis

---

## Daily Prewrite Workflow (15 min/day)

### After Each Class

1. **Identify testable doctrines** (5 min)
   - What had clear elements?
   - What appeared in hypos?
   - What did professor emphasize?

2. **Create skeleton prewrites** (10 min)
   - Issue statement
   - Rule statement
   - Element framework

**Result:** By end of week, have 2-4 skeleton prewrites

---

### Weekend (2 hours)

1. **Flesh out prewrites** (60 min)
   - Complete rule statements
   - Build application frameworks
   - Add examples from class

2. **Test on practice questions** (30 min)
   - Use hypos from class
   - Apply prewrite to fact pattern
   - Refine based on gaps

3. **Update MASTER_LOG** (15 min)
   - Mark which doctrines have prewrites
   - Note which need refinement

4. **Plan next week** (15 min)
   - Which prewrites to prioritize?
   - What gaps to fill?

---

## Quality Control

**Before marking prewrite as complete:**

**Structure:**
- [ ] Follows template exactly
- [ ] Issue is fill-in-the-blank ready
- [ ] Rule is complete and accurate
- [ ] Application framework guides fact analysis
- [ ] At least 2 examples (variations)

**Content:**
- [ ] Rule statement includes all elements
- [ ] Triggers are specific (red flags)
- [ ] Examples show strong vs. weak facts
- [ ] Professor's emphasis incorporated
- [ ] Past exam appearances noted

**Integration:**
- [ ] References to review content
- [ ] Connected to outline sections
- [ ] Cross-references to related doctrines

- Refined: [list of updated prewrites]
- Gaps identified: [topics still needing prewrites]

**Cumulative:**
- Doctrinal prewrites: [count]
- Policy prewrites: [count]
- Topics covered: [percentage]
```

## Testing Prewrites

### Method 1: Past Exam Questions

1. **Choose past exam question**
2. **Identify relevant prewrite**
3. **Apply prewrite to facts**
4. **Time yourself** (exam conditions)
5. **Review and refine**

**What to check:**
- Did prewrite cover all issues?
- Was application framework clear?
- Did examples prepare you for variations?

---

### Method 2: Class Hypos

1. **Pull hypo from class**
2. **Identify relevant prewrite**
3. **Apply prewrite**
4. **Compare to professor's analysis**

**What to check:**
- Did prewrite capture professor's framing?
- Were elements correctly identified?
- Did conclusion follow from framework?

---

### Method 3: Spaced Repetition

1. **Review prewrite** without looking
2. **Recall rule statement**
3. **Recall element framework**
4. **Test with new fact pattern**

**Schedule:**
- Day 1: Create prewrite
- Day 3: Review (recall rule)
- Day 7: Review (apply to hypo)
- Day 14: Review (apply to exam question)

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Too many prewrites to create
**Solution:** Prioritize - what appears most often in past exams? What did professor emphasize?

**Issue:** Prewrite doesn't fit exam question
**Solution:** Add more variations to examples - test with different fact patterns

**Issue:** Can't memorize all rules
**Solution:** Focus on prewrites for high-frequency topics - rely on outline for rest

**Issue:** Prewrite is too rigid
**Solution:** Add "alternatives" section - how to adjust for different fact patterns
