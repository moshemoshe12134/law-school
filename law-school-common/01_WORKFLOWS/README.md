# 01_WORKFLOWS - Core Workflows

**Purpose:** Contains all workflow documentation - step-by-step processes for every major task in the study system.

## Core Workflows

### Pre-Class Workflows
- `PRE_CLASS_WORKFLOW.md` - Generate audio and text preps before each class

### Post-Class Workflows
- `POST_CLASS_WORKFLOW.md` - Process transcripts, extract exam signals, update outline

### Exam Preparation Workflows
- `EXAM_PREP_WORKFLOW.md` - Build prewrites, daily drills, practice exams

### Quality Control Workflows
- `QC_WORKFLOW.md` - Iterative quality control for all deliverables

## References
- `REFERENCES/` - Supporting documentation and guides

## Usage

1. **Before class:** Follow `PRE_CLASS_WORKFLOW.md`
2. **After class:** Follow `POST_CLASS_WORKFLOW.md`
3. **Throughout semester:** Use `EXAM_PREP_WORKFLOW.md`
4. **After generating any document:** Run through `QC_WORKFLOW.md`

## Workflow Principles

- Each workflow is a numbered checklist (tick off as you go)
- All workflows reference templates from `03_TEMPLATES/`
- All workflows track status in course `MASTER_LOG.md`
- QC happens by editing documents in place (not separate docs)

## Integration

Workflows connect to:
- `03_TEMPLATES/` - Use these templates when executing workflows
- `02_STYLE_GUIDES/` - Apply these standards when executing workflows
- Course folders - Update course files when executing workflows
