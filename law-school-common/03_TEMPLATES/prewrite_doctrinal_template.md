# [Doctrine Name] Analysis

**Purpose:** Copy-paste ready IRAC analysis for exam use

---

## PREWRITE (Copy-Paste Ready)

**Issue:** Whether [party] can [claim/defense] under [doctrine].

**Rule:** Under [citation], the [doctrine] applies when [state rule]. The [doctrine] requires: (1) [element 1] defined as [definition]; (2) [element 2] defined as [definition]; (3) [element 3] defined as [definition]; and (4) [element 4] defined as [definition]. [Additional requirements or exceptions].

**Application:**

Here, [party] DOES/DOES NOT satisfy element 1 because [FACTS showing...]. Element 2 IS/IS NOT met because [FACTS showing...]. Element 3 PRESENTS/DOES NOT PRESENT [challenge] because [FACTS showing...]. Element 4 EXISTS/DOES NOT EXIST because [FACTS showing...]. [Additional elements as needed].

**Conclusion:** Therefore, [party] CAN/CANNOT [claim/defense] under [doctrine].

## TRIGGERS

**Invoke [doctrine] when:**
- [Trigger condition 1]
- [Trigger condition 2]
- [Trigger condition 3]

**RED FLAGS (doctrine NOT available):**
- [Red flag 1]
- [Red flag 2]
- [Red flag 3]

## FRAMEWORK

### Element 1: [Element Name]

**What to show:** [What facts demonstrate this element]

**Fact patterns:**
- [Pattern that satisfies element]
- [Pattern that fails element]

**Analysis template:**
```
Element 1 IS/IS NOT met because [FACTS]. The court looks for [standard] and here [ANALYSIS].
```

### Element 2: [Element Name]

**What to show:** [What facts demonstrate this element]

**Fact patterns:**
- [Satisfying pattern]
- [Failing pattern]

**Analysis template:**
```
Element 2 IS/IS NOT met because [FACTS]. The key question is [LEGAL QUESTION] and here [ANALYSIS].
```

### Element 3: [Element Name]

**What to show:** [What facts demonstrate this element]

**Challenges:** [Common difficulties in proving this element]

**Analysis template:**
```
Element 3 PRESENT/NOT PRESENT because [FACTS]. Courts consider [FACTORS] and here [ANALYSIS].
```

### Element 4: [Element Name]

**What to show:** [What facts demonstrate this element]

**Analysis template:**
```
Element 4 EXISTS/DOES NOT EXIST because [FACTS].
```

---

## DEFENSES / COUNTERARGUMENTS

**Defenses to [doctrine]:**
1. [Defense 1]: [When it applies]
2. [Defense 2]: [When it applies]

**Counterarguments to anticipate:**
- [Opponent's argument 1]: [How to rebut]
- [Opponent's argument 2]: [How to rebut]

---

## EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS

### Example 1: Clear [Doctrine] Application

**Facts:** [Short fact pattern - 2-3 sentences]

**Analysis:**
[Party] satisfies element 1 because [application]. Element 2 is met because [application]. Element 3 presents because [application]. Element 4 exists because [application]. [Doctrine] applies.

**Result:** [Party] [wins/loses].

---

### Example 2: [Doctrine] NOT Available

**Facts:** [Short fact pattern]

**Analysis:**
[Party] may have attempted element 1 because [application]. But element 2 is NOT met because [application - missing key fact]. Without element 2, [doctrine] fails regardless of other elements.

**Result:** [Party] [loses].

---

### Example 3: Edge Case / Ambiguous

**Facts:** [Fact pattern with gray area]

**Analysis:**
Element 1 is satisfied because [application]. Element 2 presents a close question because [arguments for both sides]. Courts would likely find element 2 [met/not met] because [key factor]. Element 3 is [met/not met] because [application]. The close question is element 2 - if found satisfied, [doctrine] applies; if not, [doctrine] fails.

**Result:** Likely [outcome] because [key reasoning].

## POLICY CONNECTIONS

**Why [doctrine] exists:**
- [Policy rationale 1]
- [Policy rationale 2]

**Policy arguments to support [doctrine]:**
- [Argument 1]
- [Argument 2]

**Policy arguments against [doctrine]:**
- [Argument 1]
- [Argument 2]
