- Learning from experienced practitioners
- Exposure to variety of matters and clients
- Training and mentorship opportunities
- Reference your judicial experience showing interest in legal complexity

**Example**: "My judicial experience showed me the importance of precise drafting and procedure.

The training at a firm like [X] and exposure to complex matters would be invaluable."

### 2. "Why this firm?"
**Your Answer Framework** (Tailor to each firm):
- Specific practice strengths (M&A, PE, funds, healthcare, real estate)
- Recent deals or matters you've researched
- Firm culture or training program
- Connections you've made (Eliot Schwab for Simpson Thacher, Morri Weinberg for Ropes & Gray)
- Geographic considerations (NYC office)

**Example for Simpson Thacher**: "I'm particularly drawn to Simpson Thacher's leading transactional practice, especially in real estate and corporate M&A. Working with Eliot Schwab this summer at Apex Healthcare Properties has deepened my interest in sophisticated real estate transactions, and I know he speaks highly of his training here. Your recent work in [specific deal] exemplifies the complex matters I'm eager to contribute to."

### 3. "Why corporate/transactional law?"
**Your Answer Framework**:
- Interest in business and deal-making
- Proactive problem-solving vs. reactive litigation
- Cross-functional work (legal, business, financial)
- Long-term client relationships
- Building things vs. resolving disputes

**Example**: "I'm drawn to transactional work because it's forward-looking—helping clients achieve business objectives through structured agreements. My experience designing systems, like the triage process in chambers, showed me I enjoy building frameworks that solve problems proactively."

### 4. "What practice area interests you?"
**Your Answer Framework** (Be honest but flexible):
- Express genuine interest in 1-2 areas
- Acknowledge you're exploring as a 1L
- Show knowledge of what the practice entails
- Tie to your background when possible

**Examples**:
- **General M&A**: "I'm interested in M&A because of the strategic nature of the work and the cross-functional collaboration. But as a 1L, I'm eager to explore different types of transactions."
- **Healthcare M&A** (for McDermott): "The intersection of healthcare regulation and transactions fascinates me. I'll be working with a healthcare real estate company this summer, which sparked this interest."

### 5. "Tell me about yourself"
**Your Answer Framework** (60-90 seconds):
1. **Background**: Columbia 1L
2. **Experience**: Judicial Secretary to Judge Freier (case management, legal procedure)
3. **Skills**: Problem-solving (triage system), tech skills (automation), collaboration (legislative proposal)
4. **Interests**: Transactional law, specific practice areas
5. **Why interviewing**: Eager to contribute to [this firm's] [practice area]

**Example**: "I'm a first-year student at Columbia Law School. Before law school, I served as Judicial Secretary to Justice Rachel Freier in the New York Supreme Court, where I managed cases from filing through disposition. When I noticed a significant backlog, I designed and implemented a triage system that improved chambers' efficiency. I also have experience with legal tech, having automated document generation for a debt-collection agency. I founded a music production company that brought together international artists, which taught me about managing complex collaborations. These experiences have drawn me toward transactional practice where I can apply my problem-solving and project management skills to help clients achieve business objectives. I'm particularly interested in [tailor to firm/practice], which is why I'm excited to speak with you today."

- "I sometimes focus too much on perfecting details, which I learned in chambers when drafting orders. I'm working on balancing thoroughness with efficiency and knowing when something is 'good enough.'"
