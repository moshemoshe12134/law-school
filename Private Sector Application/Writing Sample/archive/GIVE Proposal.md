# <a name="_d9a6tgiu0h3m"></a><a name="_toc206169183"></a>**1. Summary**  
**The Challenge:** According to the Appellate Division’s Best Practices – Guardianship Proceedings, “the ultimate responsibility of ensuring compliance [with the guardianship process] lies with the Guardianship Judge.”<sup>[^1]</sup> However, current legal guidelines result in infrequent monitoring of Incapacitated Persons (IPs) living independently, allowing significant changes in health or living conditions to go unnoticed. This gap in oversight places vulnerable people at risk. 

**The Solution:** GIVE (Guardianship's Initiative for Visits by EMS) leverages volunteer Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel to perform regular wellness checks at IP homes as an extension of the Court's oversight authority. EMS providers have the necessary skills, trust within communities, and access needed to conduct these visits effectively, and will submit their wellness reports to the Court electronically for timely review.

**Core Goals:** GIVE aims to improve IP safety, provide timely, independent assessments to the Court, and ensure consistent monitoring of IPs’ health and living conditions. 

**Pilot Focus:** The pilot phase will utilize volunteer certified Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and paramedics within a defined geographic area. This targeted approach will facilitate careful implementation, monitoring, and ongoing improvement. 

**Collaborative Effort:** GIVE involves collaboration among various stakeholders, including legal advisors, medical professionals, court personnel, and EMS leaders. 

**Anticipated Impact:** By strengthening oversight, the pilot seeks to measurably improve the welfare of incapacitated persons and offer a scalable model for guardianship judges to apply best practices more effectively.

**Request:** We respectfully seek the endorsement and approval of the Office of Court Administration and relevant judicial authorities to proceed with the implementation of this vital pilot program. 


# <a name="_toc206169184"></a>**2. Background: The Need for Enhanced IP Monitoring**  
New York Mental Hygiene Law § 81.20(a) requires guardians to visit Incapacitated Persons (IPs) at least four times annually.<sup>[^2]</sup> Although essential, four yearly visits often prove inadequate for individuals living independently in the community.<sup>[^3]</sup> The gaps between these visits may allow significant changes in an IP’s medical condition, mental status, living environment, or overall safety to develop unnoticed. Without timely detection, these changes can escalate into health crises, emergencies, or exploitation that could have otherwise been prevented. 

In New York City, there are currently over 17,000 adults under guardianship.<sup>[^4]</sup> New York City’s population of those 65 and older reached 1.43 million in 2023, outpacing the growth of the total population since 2000 by 17 times.<sup>[^5]</sup> This issue will be compounded further in the future, with 5.6 million New Yorkers estimated to be 60 or older by 2030.<sup>[^6]</sup>  Governor Hochul’s office considered allocating $5 million from the $200 billion state budget; however, this funding alone, coupled with only the practices in MHL §81.20(a), will not meet the scale of demographic change.<sup>[^7]</sup>  

A clear and pressing need exists for more frequent, objective monitoring of IPs, especially those particularly vulnerable due to isolation or complex health issues. This pilot program addresses that critical gap by providing the Court with a direct mechanism to fulfill its statutory duty of protection, supplementing the guardian's efforts with timely, independent observations.  

Professional guardians often manage substantial caseloads, with multi-disciplinary practices that limit the time available for individualized, in-depth monitoring of each IP. These heavy caseloads can make it challenging to provide the comprehensive oversight that vulnerable IPs require. Additionally, guardians sometimes encounter difficulties gaining access to IPs' homes due to various factors including resistance from the IP, scheduling conflicts, and safety concerns. EMS personnel, by contrast, have extensive experience and specialized training in gaining access to individuals in their homes, often in challenging circumstances, and are widely viewed as trusted, non-threatening healthcare providers by the community. The Guardianship Task Force Report<sup>[^8]</sup> has further identified the need for solutions to combat rampant instances of elder abuse.

GIVE is designed to support guardians in their critical work by providing additional trained support and expertise, helping to identify emerging issues between scheduled guardian visits, and offering an additional pathway for access when traditional methods prove challenging. This collaborative approach enhances the guardian's ability to fulfill their responsibilities while leveraging medical expertise to provide valuable support in protecting the IPs under their care. The Guardianship Judge retains discretion to designate evaluators and other personnel as needed depending on the relative needs of their Guardianship Court. The GIVE initiative builds on this mandate, by enabling a more adaptive and individualized quality of care for each individual IP or Person in Need of Guardianship (PING).


# <a name="_toc206169185"></a>**3. Proposed Solution: GIVE (Guardianship's Initiative for Visits by EMS)** 
## <a name="_toc206169186"></a>**3.1. Program Concept**
GIVE leverages the unique skills of Emergency Medical Services personnel to conduct proactive, non-emergency wellness visits. Although formal "wellness checks" are not typically part of EMS duties, EMS practitioners informally and routinely perform home safety assessments and evaluate potential harms during their daily emergency and non-life-threatening calls. The structured assessments proposed in this program are therefore a natural extension of their existing training and experience. Crucially, their EMS training makes them the optimal professionals for this role, allowing them to not only identify immediate safety and health issues but also to recognize the potential for future medical consequences and escalate to an emergency response when necessary.


## <a name="_toc206169187"></a>**3.2. Program Goals & Objectives** 
The primary goal of the GIVE program is to advance the Best Practices – Guardianship Proceedings by enhancing Court oversight to ensure the safety, well-being, and quality of life of IPs living in the community.

` `Specific Objectives include:  

A.   Increasing the frequency of wellness checks for participating IPs. 

B.	Providing Courts with timely, objective, and independent assessments of an IP’s health status, living conditions, and overall care. 

C.	Offering additional oversight to enhance the effectiveness and accountability of guardianship arrangements.  

D.   Identifying and addressing potential concerns early to prevent crises.


## <a name="_toc206169188"></a>**3.3. Pilot Program Scope – Initial Phase**
A.	**Personnel:** The initial pilot phase will utilize certified Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and paramedics.  

B. 	**Target Population:** The program will focus on IPs residing in the community (i.e., not in nursing homes or other institutional care facilities). The selection of participants for the initial pilot phase will follow one of two potential models, with the final methodology to be determined by the Working Group to best balance logistical feasibility with evaluation goals:

1. **Geographic-Based Model:** This approach would focus on IPs residing within a specific, pre-determined zip code. This model allows for the concentration of EMS resources and simplifies logistical planning; or
1. **Criteria-Based Model:** This approach would involve the careful selection of a diverse cohort of 20-25 IPs from across the Court's jurisdiction to create a representative sample for robust evaluation.

1. **Inclusion Criteria:** Participants would be selected based on criteria identifying those most likely to be impacted, such as having a non-family guardian, living alone, and receiving limited (e.g., under 10 hours/week) home health assistance.
1. **Stratified Sample:** The cohort would be intentionally diversified across key variables, including IP age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, housing type, guardian type (e.g., agency vs. individual) or medical/demographic categories (e.g., dementia, cerebral palsy, stroke survivors, elderly persons, younger adults with assorted impairments).
1. **Evaluation Goal:** This targeted selection is designed to provide critical qualitative insights into whether the program works more or less effectively for specific populations, which is essential information for guiding future refinements and expansion.

# <a name="_toc206169189"></a>**4. Legal Framework**
##
## <a name="_qw6fy46hbhq3"></a><a name="_toc206169190"></a>**4.1. Judicial Empowerment: Enhancing Oversight Capabilities**
The GIVE program is designed to operate as a direct extension of the Guardianship Court’s authority, providing meaningful, real-time data to assist Judges in meeting their statutory oversight responsibilities. It supplements existing judicial tools with proactive, medically-informed insight into the conditions of Incapacitated Persons (IPs), thereby transforming the Court’s engagement from annual to continuous. This proposal empowers the Guardianship judiciary with four advantages:

**A**. **Transforms Oversight from Reactive to Proactive:** GIVE replaces reliance on delayed or crisis-based reporting with regular wellness checks conducted by trained volunteers. This early detection mechanism enables Judges to intervene at the first signs of health decline, environmental hazards, or potential abuse—before a situation escalates.

**B**. **Provides Unfiltered, Objective Data for Decision-Making:** Wellness reports, submitted through the program's secure database, provide direct insight from a neutral, third-party observer. These reports complement and verify information from guardians, reducing reliance on potentially biased sources and strengthening judicial decision-making.

**C**. **Creates a Mechanism for Verifying Compliance:** When a Judge orders specific protocols for care, GIVE allows for independent verification of compliance. EMS assessments offer tangible, documented evidence that directives are being followed—providing a new level of transparency and accountability.

D**. Extends the Court’s Reach:** Recognizing the logistical limitations of judicial oversight, GIVE acts as the “eyes and ears” of the Court in the field. This allows Judges to fulfill their duty to safeguard IPs even when direct visitation is impractical, using a scalable and sustainable approach.

## <a name="_toc206169191"></a>**4.2. Grounding in Judicial Policy and Best Practices**
GIVE is firmly rooted in established judicial policy and best practices, functioning as a practical advancement of practices already endorsed by the Second Judicial Department’s Best Practices in Guardianship Proceedings Report (the “Report”).

**A**. **Supporting Judicial Oversight and Accountability:** The Report emphasizes that the “ultimate responsibility of ensuring compliance lies with the Guardianship Judge”.<sup>[^9]</sup> GIVE directly supports Judges in fulfilling this responsibility by establishing a structured, proactive, and medically-informed monitoring system. GIVE provides Judges with timely, comprehensive, and actionable insights into the health, safety, and living conditions of IPs, enabling informed and responsive decision-making.

**B**. **Modernizing a Proven Precedent – The Volunteer Case Monitor Program:** The previously suspended Volunteer Case Monitor (VCM) program was recognized for providing unbiased, independent assessments of an IP’s condition.<sup>[^10]</sup> The Model Guardianship Part (MGP) in Suffolk County, a problem-solving court, utilized the VCM program, which operated with the Educational and Assistance Program (“EAC Inc.”). This program placed trained volunteers as the court’s “eyes and ears” to make unscheduled home visits and file written reports. The program was suspended when EAC shifted staff to meet other community needs amid limited funding, with the Report noting that reviving it would be beneficial. GIVE is a contemporary successor to that model, significantly enhancing its effectiveness by incorporating the specialized field expertise of trained EMTs and paramedics. Notably, the Report explicitly recognizes EMS providers as a “natural fit” for this role and recommends leveraging their unique capabilities to revitalize oversight mechanisms such as the VCM program.<sup>[^11]</sup> GIVE embodies this recommendation, blending proven judicial oversight strategies with innovative medical protocols.

**C**. **Fulfilling Recommendations to Broaden Professional Involvement:** The Report recommends incorporating professionals such as nurses, social workers, and mental health practitioners into the guardianship process.<sup>[^12]</sup> GIVE operationalizes this recommendation by integrating EMTs and paramedics—offering clinical insight and trusted access into the homes of IPs.

D**. Complementing the Role of Court Examiners:** GIVE complements and expands upon the role of Court Examiners, who already provide oversight under Article 81 in the narrative sections of their annual reports. EMS volunteers through GIVE similarly act as independent field observers, regularly supplying Judges with critical, timely updates on IP conditions. This enhanced flow of objective information strengthens judicial oversight, reinforces accountability, and empowers Judges with timely information to support effective and proactive guardianship management.<sup>[^13]</sup>
## <a name="_toc206169192"></a>**4.3. Upholding Core Mandates: MHL Article 81 and Part 36**

A. **Advancing the 'Least Restrictive Alternative' Mandate:** The GIVE initiative directly advances the “least restrictive alternative” standard in Mental Hygiene Law (MHL) §81.03(d) and the appointment directives in §81.16(b) by enabling Incapacitated Persons to remain in their homes under safer conditions without unnecessary loss of autonomy. Under MHL Article 81, the Court must tailor interventions to meet a person’s needs while maximizing independence and self-determination. GIVE fulfills this imperative by providing structured, non-intrusive EMS wellness visits that identify and address emerging safety risks in the least restrictive setting—the individual’s own home. These visits are Court-authorized, respectful of the person’s rights, and supported by professional training that emphasizes rapport-building, early risk detection, and prompt communication of concerns to the Court.

B. **Aligning with Part 36 Standards for Court Appointees:** This approach also aligns with the principles of Part 36 of the Rules of the Chief Judge, which prioritize competence, accountability, and efficiency in Court appointments. By engaging trained EMS providers to deliver timely, objective, and verifiable information on an Incapacitated Person’s living conditions, GIVE strengthens the evidentiary basis for judicial decision-making and ensures that interventions are proportionate and targeted. The program’s built-in reporting, conflict-of-interest safeguards, and liability protections for participating providers support transparency and public trust. In combining MHL’s least-restrictive mandate with Part 36’s standards for court appointees, GIVE offers a scalable model for guardianship oversight that is both protective and rights-preserving—meeting the judiciary’s dual obligations to safeguard vulnerable persons and respect their autonomy.
# <a name="_toc206169193"></a>**5. Operational Framework for the Pilot Program**  
## <a name="_toc206169194"></a>**5.1. EMS Team Configuration & Visit Initiation**  
A. **Proposed Model:** Wellness visits will be conducted by one or two EMTs or paramedics. As these are non-emergency visits, personnel will typically use their personal vehicles, in line with their volunteer capacity. In the event a wellness visit uncovers an emergent safety risk requiring an emergency vehicle, personnel will follow standard protocol to summon one.

B. **Assignment:** The Pilot Program Working Group, in collaboration with participating EMS agencies, will establish a clear mechanism for assigning EMS teams to efficiently and appropriately conduct these visits. 

C. **Documentation & Reporting:** After each visit, EMTs/paramedics will complete a brief electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR — the standard EMS reporting format) summarizing who was seen, key observations, concerns, and any actions taken. A secure electronic copy will be transmitted to the Court within a specified timeframe through a Court-approved, HIPAA-compliant submission process. To ensure sustainability, the program will utilize low-cost or no-cost technology solutions; for instance, we may implement a HIPAA-compliant database solution at no cost.


## <a name="_toc206169195"></a>**5.2. Training – Professionalism, Protocol, and Proven Principles** 
A. **Emphasis:** Effective implementation depends on professional, highly trained EMS personnel. Under the guidance of Dr. Tony Rosen (Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine / New York-Presbyterian Hospital), the training will emphasize professionalism, strict adherence to protocols, accountability, and evidence-based practices.<sup>[^14]</sup>  

B. **Content and Structure:** The comprehensive training program, designed under the supervision of a NYS Department of Health Certified Instructor Coordinator (CIC), will equip EMTs and paramedics for their unique roles. The training will have two primary components:

1. **Core Virtual Training:** A live, interactive virtual session delivered by a physician (Dr. Rosen or a delegate) that allows for direct interaction and qualifies for CME credits. This session will cover program protocols, IP engagement strategies, use of the assessment checklist, and reporting procedures.
1. **Field Rotations:** Participants will complete in-person rotations by visiting IPs in their homes and subsequently submitting their reports, applying training in real-world settings and gaining hands-on experience with the assessment and care model.
1. **Call Review Sessions:** EMS personnel will participate in instructor-led debriefs to review and analyze completed visits, reinforcing learning, improving care quality, and supporting continuous skill development.


## <a name="_toc206169196"></a>**5.3. Visitation Protocols & On-Site Procedures**  
A. **Standardized Approach:** EMTs and paramedics will follow a structured checklist during each wellness visit. This checklist was developed through a multi-step process, incorporating a review of established best practices, input from experienced EMS practitioners, and stakeholder feedback to ensure its clinical relevance and practical utility. This checklist, finalized by the Working Group (see Appendix B), standardizes the assessment across key domains including home safety, medical and nutritional status, Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), and emotional well-being to focus observations and ensure relevant reporting. These domains include:

1. Home Conditions: evaluating upkeep of basic utilities, pest control, tripping hazards, blocked pathways/clutter/hoarding, structural damage, and evidence of trespassers or squatters on property.
1. Medical Care, Medication, & Nutrition: observing symptoms of medical conditions, compliance with medications, food security, and other signs of malnutrition or dehydration.
1. Activities of Daily Living (ADL) & Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs): ensuring adequate hygiene, access to mail, difficulties with vision or hearing.
1. Emotional & Social Wellbeing: assessing evidence of psychiatric distress, isolation, and quality of care from designated caregivers.

EMTs and paramedics have historically relied on training protocols and professional experience to conduct routine visits. However, checklists have been shown to improve healthcare outcomes.<sup>[^15]</sup> Evaluations will be documented in an electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR) and communicated to the Courts. These checklists will be continuously edited in accordance with new standards and feedback from EMTs and paramedics.   



B. 	**Non-Emergency Findings:** Clear guidelines will outline how EMS personnel document and report significant non-urgent concerns identified during visits (e.g., inadequate food supplies, unsafe living conditions).  

C. 	**Emergency Situations:** If EMS personnel identify an acute medical or safety emergency, they will immediately initiate standard emergency response procedures, provide necessary care on-site, and facilitate transport if required, pursuant to Regional EMS Council of New York (REMSCO) protocol.  

D.	**Court Orders:** Court Orders appointing guardians, or subsequent modifying orders, will explicitly identify these wellness visits as an integral component of Court oversight and the IP’s care plan, to be conducted with the appropriate consent as detailed in Section 6.1.  


## <a name="_toc206169197"></a>**5.4. Guardian Communication & Collaborative Support**
` `Recognizing the significant challenges and demanding caseloads faced by professional guardians, GIVE is designed as a supportive resource to assist them in their vital role. This program aims to provide supplementary information and assistance, enhancing the guardian's ability to monitor the well-being of the IP.

A. **Notification and Coordination:** To facilitate a cooperative framework, guardians will be notified of the program's supportive wellness visits through the governing Court Order. The program's default procedure will be to coordinate visit windows with the guardian to ensure access and collaboration. The Order will also authorize unannounced visits when necessary to obtain an unfiltered assessment. This flexible approach balances collaborative support with the Court's fundamental oversight responsibilities.

B. **A Collaborative Reporting Process:** When EMS personnel identify any non-urgent needs or potential concerns, this information will be communicated to designated Court personnel, who will then coordinate with the guardian. This process is designed to provide guardians with additional, timely insights, reinforcing their efforts to address emerging issues between their own scheduled visits. All visit information will be managed through the program's electronic Patient Care Reports ePCR system.

C.  **Illustrative Use-Case Scenarios:** The information provided by GIVE will empower the Court to take timely and informed action. For example:

1. **Scenario #1:** An EMS team reports an empty refrigerator and pantry during a winter visit.
- **Potential Benefit:** The Court, upon receiving the report, can immediately contact the guardian to ensure food is delivered and inquire about the status of the IP's food budget and shopping arrangements, potentially preventing a crisis before it escalates.
1. **Scenario #2:** A report notes new, unexplained bruising and the IP appears withdrawn.
- **Potential Benefit:** The Court can schedule an emergency hearing, appoint a Court Evaluator or attorney for the IP to investigate further, and ensure the IP's immediate safety.
1. **Scenario #3:** A checklist indicates that a smoke detector has been disabled and there are trip hazards in the main hallway.
- **Potential Benefit:** The EMS provider, where appropriate, can remedy simple issues on the spot—such as removing a trip hazard—and will note both the hazard and the corrective action in their report. The Court can then direct the guardian to address any remaining safety issues, like the smoke detector, and report back with photographic evidence by a specific date, creating a more robust and enforceable record of home safety.
## <a name="_toc206169198"></a>**5.5. Information Management & Reporting to the Courts**  
A.	**Secure Digital Reporting:** The program's dedicated electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR) system will be used to record all wellness visits. The system is configured to securely transmit these reports directly to the Courts and other authorized recipients, such as the program's Physician Advisor Dr. Tony Rosen and Certified Instructor Coordinator (CIC) Aron J. Rosenberg, for purposes of training oversight and program evaluation.

B. 	**Confidentiality:** All information handling will strictly comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and relevant state and federal privacy laws. Court systems will securely store and seal sensitive information. 




## <a name="_toc206169199"></a>**5.6. EMS Personnel Recruitment & Engagement**  
A.	**Strategy:** The Pilot Program Working Group will engage EMS leaders and organizations, including regional volunteer ambulance corps councils (e.g., NYSVARA District 4), to recruit qualified, motivated EMTs and paramedics for participation.  

B. 	**Incentives:** To promote participation, GIVE will explore incentives such as Continuing Medical Education (CME) credits (coordinated with DOH entities like REMAC/REMSCO), Court-issued certificates of recognition (overseen by Deputy Chief Administrative Judge for Justice Initiatives Edwina G. Richardson-Mendelson), and annual recognition events. These events will facilitate engagement between EMS responders, judges, court personnel, and guardianship stakeholders.  




# <a name="_toc206169200"></a>**6. Liability Considerations**
This section outlines the legal and liability framework designed to protect all parties and ensure the GIVE program operates as a responsible and effective extension of the Court’s oversight.
## <a name="_toc206169201"></a>**6.1. Protecting EMS Personnel & Participants**   
The Pilot Program will be governed by clear protocols designed to integrate seamlessly with the Court's authority and protect participants.

A. **Court-Ordered Mandate for Wellness Visits:** To ensure a sound legal basis, the authority for wellness visits will be set forth in the Order and Judgment appointing a guardian. Recognizing that an IP or alleged incapacitated person (AIP) may be unable to execute consents or waivers, the appointing order will direct monthly in-home wellness visits by a trained EMS provider participating in the GIVE program. Where appropriate, the Order may incorporate waivers of ordinary-negligence claims by guardians and agents under a Power of Attorney against participating EMS personnel, the GIVE program, and affiliated agencies. This embeds the program within the initial judicial framework of the guardianship.

B. **Upholding the Rights of the Incapacitated Person:** The program is supportive, not intrusive, and operates with full respect for the dignity and rights of the IP. While the wellness visit is court-ordered, the IP retains all rights not expressly removed under New York Mental Hygiene Law Article 81, including the right to refuse a visit or interaction. EMS personnel will receive training on right of refusal and legal boundaries, including instruction on Public Health Law §§ 3000-a and 3013, which provide civil immunity for ordinary negligence when acting in good faith, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct. Training will emphasize rapport-building to foster trust and cooperation, and refusals are expected to be infrequent given the non-invasive nature of the wellness visits and EMS interpersonal expertise. In the rare event of a refusal, if the provider observes or reasonably suspects an emergency or imminent danger to the IP, they must render or summon aid consistent with law and protocol.

C. **Clarifying the Role of Ambulance Agencies and Insurance:** Participants serve as individual volunteers to earn CME credit. GIVE activities are not within the official duties of any EMS agency unless an agency expressly opts in by agreement. Accordingly, agency insurance does not attach absent such an opt-in.

As a condition of participation, volunteers must maintain individual professional liability insurance for EMT/paramedic practice, with coverage limits customary for independent EMS practice, and provide proof of coverage before beginning visits and upon renewal. Separately, as the program grows, we will explore establishing program-sponsored liability coverage and, if feasible, offering it as a benefit for volunteers. 

While outside the current scope of this volunteer-based pilot, if an agency were to request a formal partnership (e.g., via a memorandum of understanding) that treats GIVE visits as within the scope of agency services, we would then consider the viability of obtaining written confirmation of general liability and malpractice coverage and, where applicable, of protections under New York’s Volunteer Ambulance Workers’ Benefit Law for injuries incurred en route to, during, or from GIVE visits. Absent such an opt-in, those protections are not expected to apply.

D. **Addressing Personal Vehicle Use and Liability:** Volunteers participate in an individual capacity and will provide their own transportation. Because personal vehicle use falls outside any department or volunteer ambulance corps vehicle or insurance programs, volunteers will ensure their automobile insurance provides adequate liability coverage for travel to, from, and during GIVE visits, and, if necessary, obtain any required  endorsements (e.g., business-use or volunteer-service), and attest to such coverage at onboarding and at each renewal.

E. **Protocols for Testimony and Legal Guidance:** To protect EMS volunteers, the program will develop clear protocols on the appropriate scope of testimony if subpoenaed in guardianship-related proceedings. Volunteers will be instructed to provide objective, fact-based information drawn from their wellness-visit reports and to seek legal guidance on any limits to their testimony. All liability protections will be summarized in training materials and a participant handbook, which will include contact information for legal support in the event of a subpoena.
## <a name="_toc206169202"></a>**6.2. Addressing Potential Conflicts of Interest**
The program will implement clear protocols to identify, disclose, and manage any conflicts of interest involving EMS personnel or their respective agencies.  


# <a name="_toc206169203"></a>**7. Pilot Program Financial Considerations & Sustainability**
1. **Pilot Phase Focus:** The pilot phase will establish operational effectiveness, collect essential data, and demonstrate the feasibility and value of EMS wellness visits. During this initial stage, the program will aim to operate at minimal or no direct cost to IPs.
1. **Long-Term View:** The Pilot Program Working Group acknowledges the necessity of a sustainable funding model if the program is to expand or continue in the long term. Future phases may explore reimbursement models, such as billing for certain consumables or services through existing third-party mechanisms, provided such approaches are legally and ethically appropriate. However, identifying a funding model is secondary to successfully implementing and evaluating the pilot program itself.
# <a name="_toc206169204"></a>**8. Evaluation of the Pilot Program & Metrics for Success**
A rigorous evaluation framework is essential for determining the pilot's effectiveness and guiding future decisions. The evaluation of this program will be informed by a logic model that includes outputs and outcomes in multiple domains. The evaluation team, led by Dr. Tony Rosen, has substantial research and program evaluation experience and expertise (see:[ ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37832983/)<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37832983/>).

We hypothesize that the program will:

1. Identify potential harms for IPs that (a) may be mitigated by actions from EMS, the Court, or others, and (b) would likely go undetected for an extended period.
1. Prove to be (a) feasible and (b) acceptable to all stakeholders, including IPs, guardians, judges, other court personnel, and EMS practitioners.

**Methodology and Key Indicators:** To test these hypotheses, we will use a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative data.

1. **Quantitative analysis** will involve tracking and reporting in aggregate on the results of EMS home visits, relying heavily on information within the completed checklists in the electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR). Key quantitative indicators for success, detailed in Table A, will include:
   1. The number of IPs served, and total wellness visits conducted.
   1. The nature, frequency, and severity of wellness or safety risks identified (e.g., fall hazards, medication confusion, malnutrition) to quantify the program's direct impact.
   1. Timeliness, objectivity, and quality of information provided to the Court about IP well-being.
   1. The rate of successfully completed visits and documented reasons for any unsuccessful attempts, to assess and refine operational protocols.
1. **Qualitative analysis** will involve conducting focus groups and individual interviews with stakeholders (participating judges, court personnel, EMS providers, and, when appropriate, guardians) to understand their experience and feedback regarding program effectiveness in greater detail.

1. **Ethical Oversight and Compliance:** Throughout this evaluation process, we will ensure strict adherence to HIPAA-compliance, human subjects protection, and privacy protocols. Our research team has extensive experience with these requirements, which are particularly important when working with incapacitated persons. All evaluation activities and related research will be overseen and approved by the Weill Cornell Institutional Review Board. IRB review will be conducted at no cost to the program. We anticipate that this comprehensive evaluation will provide critical information about the program’s impact and value, as well as insight into its potential for scalability and broader implementation.

## <a name="_toc206169206"></a>**9.1. Broad-Based Support** 
GIVE has support from members of the judiciary, legal counsel, medical experts and institutions (e.g., Weill Cornell/New York-Presbyterian), court personnel, and EMS leadership. Importantly, this initiative is designed as a supportive tool for guardians, providing them with additional professional resources and objective assessments that enhance their ability to effectively serve their IP clients while managing demanding caseloads. 
## <a name="_toc206169207"></a>**9.2. Securing Necessary Approvals** 
This proposal seeks formal endorsement and approval from the Office of Court Administration and relevant judicial authorities to initiate the GIVE Pilot Program, beginning within the Second Judicial District.  
## <a name="_toc206169208"></a>**9.3. Scalability & Potential Impact –** A Model for Enhanced Care
Successful implementation of GIVE can enhance the safety and well-being of vulnerable individuals under guardianship in New York State. Beyond immediate benefits, GIVE offers a scalable and replicable model for other judicial districts within New York and potentially nationwide. It strengthens guardianship oversight through structured collaboration between judiciary and EMS resources, creating a more responsive and protective system for all incapacitated persons living independently in the community.

# <a name="_toc206169209"></a>**10. Next Steps & Implementation Plan**
Upon approval, the Working Group will execute the following structured implementation plan to guide the GIVE program from final development through a successful launch and initial review.
## <a name="_toc206169210"></a>**10.1 Foundational Framework & Tool Development** 
A. **Finalize Program Success Metrics:** Based on the established program goals, the team will finalize the specific, measurable metrics and benchmarks that will be used to evaluate the success of the pilot program. 

B. **Finalize the EMS Assessment Checklist:** A comprehensive, standalone checklist will be finalized. This checklist will be the primary tool used by individual volunteers to guide and document each home visit. 

C. **Design the Program Database and Documentation Workflow:** A secure, centralized database will be designed and built to serve as the program's primary information system. This step includes defining the workflow for volunteer submission and ingestion of checklists into the database.

D. **Develop Comprehensive Protocols for EMS Volunteers:** Detailed operational protocols and processes will be established for the individual volunteers. These protocols will cover receiving assignments, conducting home visits, guidelines for escalating a response (including transport to an ED or urgent communication with the Court), and the specific requirements for documenting visits using the program's checklist and database system.
## <a name="_toc206169211"></a>**10.2 Recruitment, Training, & Participant Identification** 
A. **Develop Certified Training Modules:** The training curriculum for participating EMS volunteers will be created, ensuring the modules will qualify for CME credits and be approved by all appropriate agencies under the supervision of Aron J. Rosenberg, a Certified Instructor Coordinator (CIC). 

B. **Recruit and Train Volunteers:** Individual EMS volunteers will be recruited for the program and trained using the finalized, certified modules. 

C. **Identify Pilot Participants:** 20-25 incapacitated persons with guardians will be identified to participate in the pilot program, ensuring the cohort meets inclusion criteria and represents a diversity of demographic and other relevant criteria.
## <a name="_toc206169212"></a>**10.3 Program Launch & Iterative Refinement** 
A. **Launch Pilot Program:** With the framework, tools, and personnel in place, the GIVE pilot program will officially be launched, and the first wellness visits will be conducted. 

B. **Continuously Refine Protocols:** Following the launch, review sessions will be called to review and refine all operational protocols based on the real-world experience and outcomes from the program.
