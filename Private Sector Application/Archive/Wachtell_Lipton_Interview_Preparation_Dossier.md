## The "Small Firm Model": Lean Staffing & Early Responsibility

### Unique Structure
Wachtell's revolutionary model contrasts sharply with traditional BigLaw:

**Traditional BigLaw Model:**
- Pyramidal structure with many associates per partner
- 5-8 associates per partner ratio
- Associates specialize in narrow practice areas
- Heavy delegation with multiple review layers

**Wachtell Model:**
- Nearly 1:1 associate-to-partner ratio
- Generalist training across corporate disciplines
- Lean staffing: 2-3 attorneys maximum on most deals
- Associates work directly with partners from day one
- No billable hour targets (unheard of in BigLaw)

### Early Responsibility
- **Direct Partner Access:** Associates sit in on partner meetings, draft key documents, and communicate with clients early in their careers
- **Deal Team Structure:** Typical deal team = 1 partner + 1-2 associates handling matters that would have 10+ lawyers at other firms
- **Broad Exposure:** Associates rotate through M&A, corporate governance, takeover defense, securities, and executive compensation
- **Client Contact**: Associates often attend board meetings and negotiations alongside partners

### Compensation Philosophy
- No hourly billing requirements
- Compensation based on merit and contribution, not hours
- Bonuses tied to firm-wide profitability (everyone shares in the firm's success)
- Base salaries significantly above market, with substantial bonuses

## Corporate Governance Innovations

### The Poison Pill (Shareholder Rights Plan)
**Invention:** Martin Lipton created the poison pill in 1982 to defend El Paso Electric against a hostile takeover by General American Oil.

**Purpose:** Allow target company boards to prevent hostile acquirers from gaining control without paying a premium to all shareholders.

**How It Works:**
- Issues rights to existing shareholders (excluding the hostile bidder)
- Rights become exercisable if acquirer crosses threshold ownership (typically 10-15%)
- Allows shareholders (except bidder) to purchase deeply discounted shares
- Creates massive dilution for hostile bidder, making acquisition prohibitively expensive

**Legacy:**
- Adopted by nearly 500 public companies within first year
- Supreme Court upheld validity in 1985 (Moran v. Household International)
- Remains the gold standard for takeover defense
- Revolutionized corporate governance and M&A landscape

### Other Innovations
- **Staggered Board Elections:** Pioneered use to prevent hostile acquirers from gaining board control quickly
- **Advancement of Corporate Social Responsibility:** Early advocates for stakeholder capitalism
- **Independent Board Leadership:** Champions of separating CEO and Chair roles
- **Say-on-Pay:** Advised companies on executive compensation governance best practices

### Ongoing Thought Leadership
- Regular publications on emerging governance issues (ESG, shareholder activism, special purpose acquisition companies)
- Annual memos on corporate governance trends
- Active in SEC rulemaking comment periods
- Martin Lipton's ongoing "The Deals" column in publications
