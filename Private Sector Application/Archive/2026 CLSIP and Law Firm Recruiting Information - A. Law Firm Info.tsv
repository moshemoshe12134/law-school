All of our lawyers are under one roof in Boston, focused on a select group of areas where we practice at the top of the market, nationally and internationally, and represent clients in their largest and most significant matters.     Our single-office model gives us the ability to match clients with a dedicated, leanly staffed team of lawyers led by highly experienced, hands-on partners and associates working under their direction.  Choate’s lawyers work together in one location and across services, maximizing value for clients by developing a sophisticated understanding of their businesses and goals and fostering long-term, collaborative relationships.  Through independent research with our clients, we’ve confirmed that the teamwork of our lawyers affords us the unusual ability to partner with clients in their success by offering customized, high-quality, practical, business-oriented solutions.

Practice area preferences asked for after offer	Yes	Yes	$4,327	Name: Daniella Beganovic, Email: dbeganovic@cgsh.com	Cleary Gottlieb operates as more than just a U.S. firm with international outposts. As a truly integrated global partnership, the firm emphasizes collegiality and respect. This principle shapes our approach to everything from hiring to compensation. Our lockstep system ensures that all Cleary lawyers, regardless of whether they're junior associates or senior partners, are compensated based solely on seniority. Hours billed and the amount of business generated has no effect on any Cleary lawyer’s compensation; lawyers are rewarded just as much for helping their colleagues as they are for helping themselves, because the focus is always on helping clients.   Our associates join practice groups based on both their preferences and our clients' needs. Under the close supervision and guidance of senior lawyers who are specifically charged with monitoring and fostering professional development, new associates gain broad experiences and training that will lay the foundation for a successful future, regardless of their chosen career path. Finally, as a firm, we place a premium on the unique perspectives of individuals from a range of backgrounds, beliefs, and life experiences. We believe this helps to keep the firm an open and exciting place to work.

For those eager to practice law at the highest level in a uniquely collaborative environment, Cravath is an exceptional place to begin and build your career.

We recruit the most promising students from a diverse array of excellent law schools, and we provide our associates with rigorous and expansive training. Our system of rotating associates at all levels of seniority through different practice areas within their department throughout their time as an associate builds their knowledge base and fosters a nimbleness in mastering new things.

Accordingly, as a summer associate you would be assigned to transactions or cases by the partner to whom you are assigned. The level of the work, just as with all our associates, would depend on your capabilities, as well as what is happening in the matters to which you are assigned. We find that our summer associates can perform very valuable work on real matters. We do not create projects for summer associates.

In these offices, there is a central Work Allocation System which allows for attorneys to enter assignments. While Summer Associates can see all assignments, they are not responsible for self-selecting them. Instead mid to senior level associates serving as Work Coordinators work to ensure an even distribution of projects including areas of practice, type of assignment, and overall number of hours. Summer Associates meet with Recruiting and Work Coordinators on a weekly basis to voice preferences for future work and to receive advice on how to manage practice. The Minneapolis office uses a formal rotation system that allows for 2 weeks in each practice area that a student is assigned to. All Summer Associates receive national work in addition to local projects as well as a pro bono assignment. These opportunities are built in so that everyone can experience what it is like to work across offices.	Practice area preferences are surveyed at the start of summer, near the middle, and at the end. Assignments are made by early spring.

Our program introduces you to the practice of law and topics like managing time and client service while providing practice specific skills-based training.    We have other unique career development resources that you’ll experience throughout your associate years. Because we know that exposure to experienced attorneys is great training, our first-year apprenticeship program provides you with 50 creditable hours for time spent learning from more senior attorneys. We also have a dedicated writing coach.  And knowing that you may not have been introduced to business development in law school, we have a targeted curriculum for you.   Please consider joining us!

We also plan a robust schedule of social events to ensure that our lawyers get to know our summer associates personally, and vice versa.	Associates are generalists.

Our Summer Program offers law students an exceptional opportunity to gain practical legal experience. You’ll work directly with lawyers on “real world” assignments that will challenge and inspire you. You’ll also connect with Irell lawyers at all levels, developing bonds that often last a lifetime. We are looking for a diverse group of candidates who demonstrate superior academic abilities, intellectual curiosity and the potential to become outstanding lawyers. We encourage students who may have had other jobs and careers in addition to their law school education to apply, as well as law students with technical degrees. When you arrive, you’ll be assigned an associate mentor. You will receive assignments typical for first-year associates from the Summer Committee. You’ll also be invited to attend team meetings, client meetings, court appearances, depositions and trials. And you can participate in pro bono work and community service projects, including adoption proceedings for needy children and their adoptive families. Training and education is a critical component of our Summer Program. We host a series of informational programs, including “Pro Bono at Irell,” “IP at I&M”, “Legal Research and Writing” and “The Business of Law,” among others. Summer associates are also invited to the regular continuing legal education (CLE) programs, outside speaker events and training sessions. In addition, you’ll have the opportunity to participate with lawyers and staff in our annual mock trial—a wrongful death trial prosecuting Wyatt Earp, presided over by a judge. Building connections is a key objective of our Summer Program. All summer associates attend a weekend retreat and a firmwide party at a hotel.

In the past, lawyers and summer associates have organized rock climbing excursions, surfing classes, cooking classes and rounds of golf, among other outings.	https://www.irell.com/careers	Vault: https://vault.com/company-profiles/law/irell-manella-llp  Chambers Associate: https://www.chambers-associate.com/irell-manella/true-picture/3628/1   Flo Forward: https://florecruit.com/v2/app/forward/firms/irell	65	14	DC: 4, Los Angeles: 9, Newport Beach: 1	DC, Los Angeles, Newport Beach	DC, Los Angeles, Newport Beach	10	Each summer associate is assigned a work coordinator who is responsible for finding them assignments in the areas in which they are most interested.	Practice area preferences asked for after offer	Varies by office location	Case-by-case basis	$4,327	Name: Nicole Miltko, Email: nmiltko@irell.com	What makes Irell & Manella LLP stand out among our BigLaw peers is the way we invest in our people. From the start, our associates take on real responsibility—many argue motions and even appear at trial within their first few years of practice. That kind of early experience is rare, and it gives our lawyers the confidence and skills to grow quickly. We also bring together a deep bench of attorneys and professional staff that have unique paths to the law, many with prior careers or advanced technical backgrounds -- but that’s by no means a requirement. What matters most is an intellectual curiosity and the ability to collaborate. Another distinction is our path to partnership. Attorneys are eligible for full equity partnership in just seven years—far faster than the 10+ years typical at most firms. And when we say partnership, we mean it: the firm is composed entirely of equity partners. On compensation, our bonuses have consistently exceeded the market—sometimes more than double. Combined with a competitive base salary ($225K for first-years up to $435K for senior associates), it’s no surprise Vault ranked us No. 1 for associate compensation among midsized law firms.
