- Verify and update each hiring contact (some roles change frequently) and add contact emails where publicly available.
- Export a CSV or Google Sheets-compatible file for easier tracking and sorting.

If you want me to proceed and fill in the other firms and verify contacts now, say "Populate top 20" and I will continue.
