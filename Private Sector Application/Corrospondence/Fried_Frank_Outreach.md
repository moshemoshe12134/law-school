Subject: Introduction from Elie Schwab - Request for a Chat

Dear Jackson,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Moshe Klein, and I'm a 1L at Columbia Law School. Elie Schwab, a longtime friend of mine and the CEO of Apex Healthcare Properties, wants to make an introduction to you and mentioned that you'd be happy to chat with me.

As Elie may have shared, I'll be working for him this summer at Apex Healthcare Properties. I'm particularly interested in [specific practice areas] and would love the opportunity to learn from your experience.

Would you be available for a brief 15-20 minute call at your convenience? I'd greatly appreciate any insights you could share about your practice and path at Fried Frank.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Moshe Klein
