Subject: Introduction from Elie Schwab - Request for a Chat

Dear Aron,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Moshe Klein, and I'm a 1L at Columbia Law School. Elie Schwab, a longtime friend of mine and the CEO of Apex Healthcare Properties, recently reached out to you on my behalf and mentioned that you'd be happy to chat with me.

As Elie may have shared, I'll be working for him this summer at Apex Healthcare Properties. I'm particularly interested in real estate finance and healthcare properties, and I'm impressed by your work advising on major commercial real estate financing transactions. Your experience with credit funds, private equity, and institutional lenders particularly caught my attention.

Would you be available for a brief 15-20 minute call at your convenience? I'd greatly appreciate any insights you could share about your practice and path at Simpson Thacher.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Moshe Klein
