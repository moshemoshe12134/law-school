**Notable:** Fellow of American College of Investment Counsel

**Key Deal:** $1.8B Concord Music Royalties Securitization

**🎵 OPENING QUESTION (The "Kill Shot"):**
> *"I was thrilled to see you on my schedule because I saw you worked on the Concord Music Royalties securitization. As a former studio owner, I've watched the industry shift from selling records to securitizing catalogs. **When you are structuring a deal like that, is the hardest part the legal framework, or is it getting the banks comfortable with the volatility of streaming revenue?**"*

**Backup Angle:**
> *"I also saw you do Data Center financing. With the AI boom, is the demand for data center capital moving faster than the deal structures can keep up?"*

---

### Session 2: Craig Phillips (3:20-3:40 PM)
**Title:** Partner, Tax  
**Path:** Davis Polk Associate (2006-2011) → GE Energy In-House (2011-2013) → Davis Polk Counsel (2013-2016) → Morrison & Foerster Of Counsel (2016-2018) → PwC Managing Director/Principal (2018-2024) → K&S Partner (Mar 2024)

**💡 OPENING QUESTION:**
> *"Coming from the Big 4, you obviously speak the language of 'valuation' and 'accounting' better than most lawyers. Do you find that gives you an edge in Tax Controversy disputes because you can deconstruct the IRS's math, not just their law?"*

**Your Angle:** Position yourself as "The Translator" between business/tech and law

---

**Your Angle:** Show you understand structural trends in finance

---

> *"I saw you just joined K&S earlier this year from Cahill Gordon. What made you decide to make the move? I'm curious if there was something specific about K&S's project finance practice that drew you here."*

**Your Angle:** He's brand new - ask about the transition, what attracted him, and what he's learned so far. This is a "fresh eyes" perspective on the firm.

**Backup Angle (if he's been talking about why he joined):**
> *"Coming from Weil and Cahill, you've seen different financing platforms. Does K&S's focus on energy and infrastructure deals feel different in terms of the deal structures you're working on?"*

---

### Session 6: Austin Whan (4:40-5:00 PM)

**🤝 OPENING QUESTION:**

## 💬 MESSAGING FRAMEWORK

### When They Ask About Your Background

| **Topic** | ❌ **Don't Say** | ✅ **DO SAY (The Pivot)** |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Music Studio** | "I made a hit song and it was cool." | "Running a studio taught me that **clients don't care about the struggle; they care about the deliverable.** I learned to take an artist's chaos and force it into a polished product on a deadline. That discipline is what I bring to deal work." |
| **Why Transactional?** | "I like business." | "I was a CTO, so I'm used to **systems thinking**. I view a merger agreement like code—if one module breaks, the whole system fails. I want to build the architecture that keeps the deal together." |
| **Why K&S?** | "It's a good firm." | "I want a firm that is **growing**. K&S New York is hiring aggressive partners and taking market share in complex finance. I want to start my career in a place that has 'momentum,' not just a legacy." |
| **Why Law after Tech?** | "I wanted a change." | "Tech taught me to build systems. Law lets me build systems that **move billions of dollars**. The stakes are different, but the discipline is the same—precision, structure, and execution under pressure." |

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### The "2-3 Minutes Left" Close-Out
**If you're running out of time and need a strong closing question:**

**Option 1 (For Partners - especially those who recently joined):**
> *"Quick last question - what surprised you most about K&S after you joined? Was there something about the firm that wasn't visible from the outside?"*

**Option 2 (For Associates - especially Austin/CR Park):**
> *"Last question - if you could go back to 1L summer, what's one piece of advice you'd give yourself about choosing a firm for your career?"*

**Option 3 (Universal - works for anyone):**
> *"I know we're out of time, but what's one deal or matter you've worked on here that you're particularly proud of?"*

**Why these work better:** They haven't spent 17 minutes answering these questions already (unlike the generic "culture" question).

---

### The "Brain Freeze"
**If they ask a technical question you don't know:**
- **DO NOT** bluff or make up an answer
- **SAY:** *"That's a fascinating issue. I don't know the specific rule on that, but based on my experience with [X], I would assume [Y]. Is that close?"*
- Shows intellectual honesty + reasoning ability

### The "Dead Air" Recovery
**If there's an awkward pause:**
- **SAY:** *"Can I ask what drew you to K&S originally? What made you choose this firm?"*
- Gets them talking, buys you time to reset
