**Culture & Training**:

- Known for sophisticated corporate work with high-profile clients
- Collaborative approach emphasized
- Hands-on training and mentorship
- Access to complex, multi-faceted transactions

**Discussion Points for Interview**:

1. **Strong 2025 for Davis Polk**: Discuss the firm's dominance in finance/lending (H1 2025 league table rankings)
2. **Oliver Smith as co-head**: His recent "Dealmaker of the Year" award and ExxonMobil work shows firm's market-leading M&A presence
3. **National security focus**: Benjamin Joseloff hire (literally just joined) signals firm's strategic focus on cross-border M&A with regulatory complexity
4. **Leverage finance strength**: Davis Polk is seeing surge in LBO activity and is well-positioned for upcoming "tsunami of LBO activity"
5. **Diversity of matters**: From semiconductor deals (Qorvo/Skyworks) to healthcare (Revance), to energy sector (Baker Hughes)

**Questions to Prepare & Ask** (Strategic & Thoughtful):

**Question #1: Summer Associate Work Reality**
"When a deal accelerates and the team hits a closing deadline in August, what actually happens to the summer associates? Are they still involved in substantive work, or does staffing shift?"

**Question #2a: Finance Differentiation**
"Davis Polk ranked #1 in acquisition financing—but many elite firms have the expertise to finance deals and maintain F500 relationships. What actually separates Davis Polk's financing practice from competitors at that level?"

**Question #2b: Impact on Associate Training**
"How does that #1 position in financing actually change the work junior associates do on M&A deals? Are they working more on capital structure and financing strategy than they would at a firm without that depth?"

**Question #3: Cross-Border Regulatory Landscape**
"I've been reading about increasing regulatory scrutiny in cross-border deals—antitrust, CFIUS, export controls. What's Davis Polk seeing in the market right now? Is this becoming a bigger factor in deals you're staffing?"
*[Follow-up if time]: "That makes sense. I noticed the firm just brought in Benjamin Joseloff from Treasury with CFIUS background—was that hire a direct response to seeing more of these issues?"*

**Question #4: Market Timing**
"In Davis Polk's H1 2025 finance report, Jason Kyrwood mentioned expecting a 'tsunami of LBO activity' coming soon. What does that mean for junior associate staffing and the types of deals junior associates would be working on?"

---

**Timing Strategy**:

- Lead with Q1 (quick answer, 2-3 min)
- Jump to Q2a + 2b (these go together, 3-4 min combined)
- Q3 is your substantive closer (3-4 min)
- Q4 only if time remains
- Save last 2-3 minutes for them to ask you questions

---

### 2. **Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz** (Interview: 1/8/2025) - Rank #1

**Your Positioning**: General corporate/M&A interest (they will assume you want M&A—it's what they do)

**WACHTELL FIRM INTEL (As of January 2026)**:

**What Makes Wachtell Unique - READ THIS CAREFULLY**:
- **Single Office Model**: Only ~260 attorneys, all in Manhattan (unique among top firms)
- **Lockstep Partnership**: All partners paid the same (old-fashioned partnership model)
- **Extreme Profitability**: $6.53 million profit per equity partner (2019, likely higher now)
- **Selective Matters**: Firm is choosy about which deals they take—not focused on maximizing volume
- **The "Collegial" Firm**: Decision-making based on consensus; culture of collaboration, not hierarchy
- **No Office Politics**: Single office eliminates regional competition for matters/clients

**Why They're #1 in M&A**:
- **Takeover Defense Expertise**: Known as "corporate America's legal defense force"—specialize in hostile bid defenses, unsolicited offers
- **Activist Investor Defense**: Regularly defend boards against activist campaigns and proxy fights
- **Institutional Knowledge**: When big companies face takeover threats, they call Wachtell (founded the concept of the "poison pill")
- **Client Base**: Fortune 100 companies that return repeatedly—not chasing new clients
- **Lean Staffing Philosophy**: Do more with fewer people—everyone is premium talent

**Recent Major Deals** (Last 12 months):
- ConocoPhillips/Marathon Oil: $22.5B (Jan 2025)
- Bausch & Lomb/Novartis: $2.5B divestiture (2024)

- **11-week program** at $4,423/week
- **2023 offer rate**: 31 out of 31 2Ls received offers (100%)
- **Rotation Model**: Not assigned to specific practice area—exposure to multiple groups
- **Director**: Elizabeth F. Breslow (recruiting@wlrk.com, 212-403-1334)

**Associate Experience** (Key Points):
- Associates play a "critical role in firm success" (direct quote from website)
- "Substantial responsibility" given to associates
- Access to sophisticated, high-stakes matters (not grunt work)
- Lean staffing means junior lawyers do real work, not document review
- Early exposure to client contact

**Rankings & Recognition**:
- #1 Vault Ranking for 14+ consecutive years (10 times as #1, often #2)
- Ranked #1 in M&A (all rankings)
- Band 1 elite tier in Chambers USA
- Known for writing memos on takeover defense and activist investor strategy (published guidance)

**The Small Firm Advantage** (Why This Matters):

- Partners more accessible and mentorship more personal
- Less bureaucracy, faster decision-making
- Focus on quality over volume
- Loyalty and long-term relationships (firm looks for people they want to work with for decades)

**Culture & Philosophy**:
- **Founded 1965** by Herb Wachtell, Martin Lipton, Leonard Rosen, George Katz (all from NYU, old colleagues)
- **Traditional partnership values**: Merit-based, collaborative, selective
- **Prestige over growth**: Firm doesn't want to become a mega-firm
- **Institutional Memory**: Deep knowledge of corporate governance and takeover law

**What Wachtell Values in Associates** (Read between the lines from their messaging):
- Intellectual rigor and legal sophistication
- Team player mentality (collegial firm values this)
- Good judgment (they work on high-stakes matters)
- Long-term commitment mindset (not just using summer to explore)
- Ability to handle ambiguity and complex problems
- Communication skills (partners will ask you to think, not just execute)

---

**THE INTERVIEW STYLE** (Why It's "Deep"):

Wachtell interviews are known for being:
1. **Intellectually rigorous** - They'll ask you to think through complex scenarios
2. **Probing** - They test how you think, not just what you know
3. **Conversational but substantive** - Not a checklist; more of a dialogue
4. **About judgment** - They want to see your analytical approach to problems
5. **Less about "why Wachtell" sales pitch** - More about your genuine interest in corporate law and problem-solving

**Key Questions They May Ask** (Prepare Thoughtfully):

1. **"Tell me about a time you had to make a difficult judgment call. What was your process?"**
   - They want to see HOW you think, not just the outcome
   - Reference your judicial experience (quick decision-making with discretion)
   - Show your triage system as problem-solving methodology

2. **"What draws you to corporate law / M&A?"**
   - Be genuine—say "sophisticated problem-solving" not "deal flow"
   - Show you understand it's about advising on high-stakes decisions
   - Wachtell isn't for people chasing the money; it's for people who love the work

3. **"What's the difference between a good lawyer and a great lawyer?"**
   - This is a Wachtell-style question
   - They value judgment, communication, integrity, collaborative spirit
   - Show you think about the profession beyond technical skills

4. **"What would you do if a senior partner asked you to do something ethically questionable?"**
   - Small firm means integrity is paramount
   - They're testing your judgment and independence of thought
   - Wachtell has low tolerance for political maneuvering

5. **"Describe a complex situation you've encountered and how you analyzed it"**
   - Use your judicial experience or triage system
   - Show systematic thinking, not just gut reactions
   - Explain your reasoning clearly

---

**Questions for Them** (Strategic for Wachtell):

**Question #1: Small Firm Philosophy**
"I'm drawn to Wachtell's single-office model—is that a significant part of how the firm operates, or is it incidental to your practice? How does it shape the day-to-day work?"
- *Why this works*: Shows you understand their unique positioning; tests whether they're proud of it
- *Likely answer*: They'll emphasize collaboration, knowledge-sharing, culture
- *Your follow-up*: "Does that mean associates get a different type of exposure to senior lawyers?"

**Question #2: Takeover Defense & Judgment**
"Wachtell is famous for takeover defense work. When the firm advises a board on whether to resist a hostile bid, how much is pure legal analysis vs. business judgment and strategy? What's an associate's role in that?"
- *Why this works*: Tests whether you understand this isn't just transactional work; it's counseling
- *Likely answer*: Discussion of legal framework (fiduciary duty, Delaware law) + strategy
- *Your follow-up*: "How does that require different training than other M&A work?"

**Question #3: Selective Matter Intake**
"I've read that Wachtell is selective about which matters the firm takes on. How does that philosophy influence which associates get staffed on what deals? Are associates ever involved in the 'pitch' or new matter decision?"
- *Why this works*: Shows you understand firm strategy; asks about practical impact on associates
- *Likely answer*: Discussion of firm values, maybe some matters are declined
- *Your follow-up*: "From an associate's perspective, does that mean the work you get is curated?"

**Question #4: Lean Staffing Model**
"With fewer people than peer firms, Wachtell seems to rely on associates to do more substantive work early. Is that accurate? What's the tradeoff—more responsibility but also more pressure?"
- *Why this works*: Acknowledges their unique model; asks about realism
- *Likely answer*: Yes to more responsibility; discussion of support/mentorship
- *Your follow-up*: "How does the firm ensure junior associates don't get overwhelmed?"

**Question #5: Long-Term Culture**
"Wachtell has been #1 for over a decade. From your perspective, what holds the firm together and keeps it performing at that level?"
- *Why this works*: Philosophical question; tests if they're thinking about firm culture
- *Likely answer*: Partnership values, client relationships, quality over growth
- *Your follow-up*: "What are you looking for in summer associates who might become associates and stay?"
