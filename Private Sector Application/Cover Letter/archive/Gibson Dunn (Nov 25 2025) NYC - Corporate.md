Re: 2027 2L Summer Associate Position

Dear Members of the Hiring Committee:

I am a first-year student at Columbia Law School applying for a 2027 2L Summer Associate position at Gibson Dunn. Drawn to the firm's leading transactional and litigation practices and global reach, I am particularly interested in supporting sophisticated work in corporate transactions, while remaining open to contributing across a broad range of practice areas.

I am excited to offer Gibson Dunn my experiences in legal procedure, proactive problem-solving, and collaborative project management. As Judicial Secretary to the Hon. Rachel E. Freier in the New York Supreme Court, I managed the complete lifecycle of cases, requiring sophisticated procedure and discretion.

Furthermore, I have a track record of delivering solutions to complex challenges. To resolve a case backlog, I designed a triage system. I applied this approach in commercial settings, automating document generation for efficiency.

I have experience building consensus among diverse stakeholders. As lead editor for a legislative proposal, I coordinated judges, counsel, and officials. I also founded Shirim Music Studios, collaborating with artists. I will draw on these skills with your client and firm teams.

Sincerely,

Moshe S. Klein
