Re: 2027 2L Summer Associate Position

Dear Members of the Hiring Committee:

I am a first-year student at Columbia Law School applying for a 2027 2L Summer Associate position at your firm. I am drawn to Simpson Thacher's leading transactional practice, particularly in real estate and corporate deals, I am especially interested in supporting sophisticated work in these areas. I will be working directly under Eliot Schwab, a former associate at Simpson Thacher and now President at Apex Healthcare Properties, during my 1L summer on complex transactions. Our long-standing mentorship—he has been my mentor for 10 years—has deepened my enthusiasm for the firm's expertise and collaborative approach.

I am excited to offer my experiences in proactive problem-solving, and collaborative project management. As Judicial Secretary to the Hon. Rachel E. Freier in the New York Supreme Court, I managed the complete lifecycle of cases from calendaring hearings to drafting judicial orders. This work required a sophisticated grasp of legal procedure and significant discretion.

Furthermore, I have a track record of delivering concrete solutions to complex challenges. To resolve a tremendous case backlog in chambers, I designed and implemented a new triage system. I applied this same results-oriented approach in commercial settings, automating legal document generation to improve efficiency for a debt-collection agency that I consulted for.

I also have experience building consensus among diverse, high-level stakeholders. As the lead editor for a legislative proposal for the New York State Unified Court System, I coordinated between judges, counsel, and state agency officials to synthesize varied perspectives into a unified document. I applied the same consensus-building approach as founder of Shirim Music Studios, bringing together international artists on collaborative projects. I will draw on these skills when working with your client and firm teams.

Sincerely,

Moshe S. Klein
