Re: 2026 1L Summer Associate Position

Dear Ms. Marcus:

I am a first-year student at Columbia Law School and am writing to apply for a 2026 1L Summer Associate position at Kirkland & Ellis. I am particularly drawn to Kirkland & Ellis for its market-leading corporate and M&A practice and recent work across complex transactions, including its counsel to Walgreens Boots Alliance on a significant acquisition. I am eager to contribute to complex transactional matters and to learn more about Kirkland's New York–based M&A platform.

I am excited to offer Kirkland & Ellis my experiences in legal procedure, proactive problem-solving, and collaborative project management. As Judicial Secretary to the Hon. Rachel E. Freier in the New York Supreme Court, I managed the complete lifecycle of cases from calendaring hearings to drafting judicial orders. This work required a sophisticated grasp of legal procedure and significant discretion.

Furthermore, I have a track record of delivering concrete solutions to complex challenges. To resolve a tremendous case backlog in chambers, I designed and implemented a new triage system. I applied this same results-oriented approach in commercial settings, automating legal document generation to improve efficiency for a debt-collection agency that I consulted for.

I have experience building consensus among diverse, high-level stakeholders. As the lead editor for a legislative proposal for the New York State Unified Court System, I coordinated between judges, counsel, and state agency officials to synthesize varied perspectives into a unified document. I applied the same consensus-building approach as founder of Shirim Music Studios, bringing together international artists on collaborative projects. I will draw on these skills when working with your client and firm teams.

Sincerely,

Moshe S. Klein
