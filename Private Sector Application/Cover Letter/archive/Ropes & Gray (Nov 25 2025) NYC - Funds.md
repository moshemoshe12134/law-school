Re: 2027 2L Summer Associate Position

Dear Members of the Hiring Committee:

I am a first-year student at Columbia Law School applying for a 2027 2L Summer Associate position at your firm. I am particularly interested in supporting sophisticated work in asset management, sponsor-side fundraising, and fund formation. I recently connected with Morri Weinberg, a funds partner at Ropes & Gray, and our conversation reinforced my enthusiasm for the firm's collaborative approach.

I am excited to offer Ropes & Gray my experiences in proactive problem-solving, and collaborative project management. As Judicial Secretary to the Hon. Rachel E. Freier in the New York Supreme Court, I managed the complete lifecycle of cases, requiring sophisticated procedure and discretion.

I also have experience building consensus among diverse stakeholders. As lead editor for a legislative proposal, I coordinated judges, counsel, and officials. I will draw on these skills while working with your client and firm teams.

Sincerely,

Moshe S. Klein
