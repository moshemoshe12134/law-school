ANSWER ONLY THREE (3)
DuPont - Pioneer Joint Venture.
In negotiating the Dupont/Pioneer Hi-Bred joint venture we were told by Pioneer's
counsel that negotiating the terms of the "Standstill Agreement" and DuPont's rights in the event of a
competing investment both of which were part of the Investment Agreement) was difficult and at times
contentious. Counsel also suggested that he had a difficult time persuading Pioneer's executives that
these terms were very important. (a) What interests of DuPont were at stake with respect to the terms of
the standstill and competing investment provisions? What interests of Pioneer? (1) How might the terms
of the standstill affect future negotiations between the parties?
Triad Auto Loan Securitization.
Triad needs to raise money to finance its primary business, which is initiating and then
administering subprime auto loans. Two general approaches are possible. Triad could keep the loans it
initiates in itsown portfolio and borrow money to make additional loans, perhaps giving the lender a
security interest in its portfolio of auto loans or on an unsecured basis. Alternatively, Triad could choose
to sell the loans through a securitization, retaining the administrative role with repsect to the assets sold.
In both approaches, the fluids are supplied by lenders willing to hold fixed income securities. Both
approaches involve the company acquiring capital on the strength of its assets. However, Triad may have
less incentive to energetically administer loans belonging to some one else than if it owned the loans
itself. How might the securitization nonetheless add value?
Willis-Stein Private Equity.
Many private equity limited partnerships are oriented towards high tech, early stage
companies, many of which have generated neither profits nor positive cash flow prior to the limited
partnership investment. The Willis-Stein partnership targeted Midwestern, middle market, low tech
companies valued in the $25-$500 million range. Nevertheless, its compensation scheme was roughly the
same as that of the high tech oriented private equity partnerships. After repaying the limited partners for
their fmancing of a particular purchase, the general partner receives 80 percent of the gains until it has
obtained 20 percent of the amount paid out. After that point the limited partners receive 80% and the
general partners 20%. The details vary between fluids, but the basic structure is similar. Why, despite the
dramatic difference in their portfolio companies, do the funds have such a similar payout structure?
Tuscan Deal.
This deal involved four principal acquisitions: (1) the purchase of Tuscan; (2)
Schreiber's purchase of Steinhardt's interests; (3) Schreiber's purchase of Lehigh; and (4) Schreiber's
sale of Tuscan and Lehigh to Mid-America Dairymen. Schreiber told us that the four transactions
involved very different kinds of representations and warranties. Transaction (1) involved unqualified
representations by Labatt. Transaction (2) involved no representations and warranties. Transaction (3)
involved unqualified representations and warranties. Transaction (4) involved representations and
warranties largely limited to the knowledge of seller.

Explain how the characteristics of the transactions might explain the pattern of representations and
warranties that is observed.

Chilean Debt Restructuring.
Counsel for Chile emphasized the importance of the norm of "equal treatment" for all
creditors in putting together the structure of the deal. How did the 1984 and 1986 restructurings inhibit
Chile from differentiating among creditors in the implementation of deal? (A) Explain how the structure
of the deal both created incentives for creditors to sign on to the deal and deal with the possibility that a
creditor eligible for the restructuring might "holdout" and thereby extract special benefits. ~) Certain
classes of creditors were not eligible for, or a part of; the restructuring. Briefly explain how the deal
attempted to cope with the possibility that those classes of creditors excluded from restructuring did not
secure special treatment.
