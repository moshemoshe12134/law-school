**Deals Final Outline:**

# 1: Introduction

- Not learning a body of law. Instead about fundamental problems in transactions  
- Paranoia of a deal: See potential of a deal and recognize the pitfalls and steer your client around them  
- Although deals are different in many ways and encounter many problems, there are similar fundamental problems and potential solutions and a toolkit to solve them in each setting  
  * Understand problems  
  * Address them with solutions

- **2 Themes in Class – Where do lawyers add value in a deal:**  
  * **1\) Overcoming a familiar set of problems and incentives**  
  * **2\) Regulatory arbitrage**  
    * **You can do transactional things that are similar but receive different treatment; Steer client direction with better treatment**  
    * Tax planning  
- Similarities across different areas of practice  
  * Non-profits and VC are similar

- **Information and Incentive problems exist in every transaction and can prevent parties from engaging in transactions**  
- **Some tactics can manage these incentive problems and bridge information asymmetry so that parties can proceed with value-maximizing deals**  
  * Lawyers help navigate these problems

1\. I offer to sell you a used car for $5,000.  You need a car and the price is within your budget.

1. Is there anything else you need to know or think about before you agree to purchase the car?

- Usage: Mileage  
- Damage  
- Repairs  
- Legality  
- Why you are selling it

- Need assurances in writing because seller knows more about the quality of the car  
- The fact that you are selling alone may question the car’s value  
  * If the seller knows more and wants to sell it, signals bad news  
- **The fact that the seller knows more combines with the fact that the seller wants to sell should raise questions**

2. Please define the term “asymmetric information.” How does it apply to the purchase of a used car?  
- **Asymmetric information \= Seller knows more than buyer**  
  * Arises in almost every transaction because sellers know more than buyers  
  * Combined with fact that they are willing to sell 🡪 Raises questions

3. In principle, could the problem of asymmetric information persuade a potential buyer not to buy a used car? Could this be true even if the used car is as good as the seller says it is?  
- It could be that the seller is telling the truth  
- **Seller also needs to communicate properly to buyer the truth. Otherwise, asymmetric information can persuade buyer to walk**

- Paranoia of asymmetric information can persuade buyers not to buy  
- Identify the ambiguity and figure out what to do about it

4. As a buyer, would you be more comfortable if you can ask me questions?  What if I am not honest in my answers? How can you improve the odds that I will answer honestly (or, at least, prove later that my answers were false)?  
- Questions make buyer more confident  
- **Transaction potential that buyer is asking information about \= Due diligence process**  
  * **DD can serve as a potential response to asymmetric information**

5. Would you be more comfortable if we bring in a mechanic to look at the car?  
- Yes. Part of the due diligence process  
- Or could be apart from DD – bring in third party expert  
  * **Bringing in third party experts is another solution to asymmetric information**

6. In part “E,” what if the mechanic is my brother-in-law? Please define the term “agency cost.”  
- Incentives are wrong  
- **Agency Cost \= Sometimes you are supposed to do something in best interest of principal but agent actually acts for their personal interest instead**  
  * Can interfere with a transaction

- **1\) Start with information problem: Buyer doesn’t know what seller knows**  
- **2\) Look for various solutions: Only work if they do not create a different kind of problem (an incentive problem/agency cost problem)**

7. Would you be more comfortable if I offer to let you pay only $2,000 now, and to pay $3,000 in a year if the car is still running well?  
- **Contingent Purchase Price: This is a common solution to an asymmetric information problem**  
  * **Maybe this is what the buyer would pay for a badly used car; gives possibility of upgrading payment to a good used car**

8. In Part “G,” does it matter how we define whether the car is “running well”?  
- Yes. This could give rise to a dispute in the future  
- Layers of this problem:  
  * **Even if both parties act in good faith, it is hard to measure “running well”**  
  * **Each party has an incentive to define “running well” in a particular way**  
    * **New information problem. How does seller prove that he was right and it really was running well?**

9. If we agree to the idea in “G,” would it affect how carefully you take care of the car? Please define the term “moral hazard.”  
- **The buyer has an incentive to treat the car poorly to inflict enough damage on the car (that seller can’t prove wasn’t their fault) so that they avoid paying the upgrade in price**

- **Contingent purchase price is hard to measure in unanticipated situations but when it is possible it can eliminate asymmetric information problem because it can give assurance to uncertain buyer**  
    
- **Moral Hazard: A type of incentive problem especially focused on risk**  
  * Another version of agency cost  
  * **Protection against risk makes it more likely that you take more risk**  
    * **You will be more reckless when someone else bearing the loss**

10. Instead of a car, assume I offer to sell you a house for $500,000.  You need a house and the price, again, is within your budget. Is there asymmetric information in this situation? As you consider whether to buy the house, could variations of the steps discussed above for buying a car be helpful?  
- Asymmetric information problem: Seller knows more about the house  
- If the seller were going to move down the street, this raises questions because it is more likely that the problem is with the house

- Assurances for home buyers:  
  * Due Diligence (Inspection)  
  * Third party experts (Inspectors)  
  * Contingent purchase price (Reduce the purchase price unless the pipes stop working)  
- Problems and solutions for buying a home are similar to buying a car even though the setting is different

11. What if you want to buy a business? Is there asymmetric information in this situation? Are variations of the steps discussed above potentially helpful?  
- Yes. You will have asymmetric information that could prevent you from doing a deal  
- These mechanisms give confidence to buyers to do a deal that they otherwise might not want to do

- You want to protect yourself when doing a deal but also that you don’t walk away from one that could be beneficial

12. Do you agree with the following statement? “Because the seller always knows more than the buyer, I should never buy anything ever again?”  
- No.

13. Do you agree with the following statement? **“Although transactions vary in their details, every transaction involves problems of information and incentives that can discourage parties from entering into what otherwise would be value-maximizing arrangements.”**  
- Correct.

14. Do you agree with the following statement? **“A central responsibility of transactional lawyers is to help overcome information and incentive problems.  They do so with a range of contractual and organizational responses, such as due diligence, contingent purchase price, staged financing, and vouching by third parties.”**

\- Correct.

2\. Stores that sell clothes online often allow people to return them at no charge. But it costs them time and money to let people return them.  

1. Why give people a “money-back guarantee” of this sort?

- Creates incentive for buyers to buy more  
- 2 Benefits for Sellers:  
  * 1\) Sellers can make sales to people who would not otherwise buy. The buyer may be lazy or forget to return it  
  * 2\) Buying clothes online has more asymmetric information problem than brick and mortar store  
    * **Money back guarantee helps buyer overcome asymmetric information problem**

2. If you sell clothes online, and someone who buys them spills wine on them, would you accept the clothes back?  
- No. Because **the function of the guarantee is to allow the buyer to conduct due diligence on the product – not alter the product**

3. You are the CEO of an online retail store. You decide to offer a new option to buyers: if they pay an extra amount, they can return clothes in the first year for any reason, including the fact that they stained them. You learn that under the old system—no returns for stains—one in ten items of clothing are stained during the first year. As a result, if you charge an extra 10%, would that be enough to fund the return policy? (Hint: If you sell people the right to return clothes they have stained, do you think it will affect how careful they are with the clothes?)  
- No. Because the protection of having the guarantee creates a moral hazard to damage the clothes more

1) **Asymmetric information problem**  
2) **Solution to it**  
3) **Trying to make a solution that goes beyond the asymmetric information problem (providing effective insurance) creates a moral hazard problem**

3\. You want to go into business organizing outdoor concerts.  A challenge, though, is that it sometimes rains, so the concert has to be cancelled. 

1. Do you consider this to be an issue of asymmetric information or an issue of uncertainty? What is the difference?

- **Uncertainty because neither party knows what the weather will be**  
  * **Uncertainty \= Neither party knows**  
  * **Asymmetric information \= One party knows more than the other**

2. If a concert is cancelled because of rain, who should bear this risk—the performer, the ticket holders, or the owner of the arena?  
- **Bargaining Power in a transaction exists but it is not the only explanation for who should bear a particular risk (because other parts of the transaction can be used to accommodate risk-bearer)**  
  * **Bargaining Power helps you, but you must be strategic in deciding how to use it**

- Performer: Could play at an indoor arena so does not want to bear the risk  
  * Easy to avoid risk by not doing the transaction  
- Ticket Holders: Could go to the indoor arena so does not want to bear the risk  
  * Easy to avoid risk by not doing the transaction  
- Owner: Usually bears the risk  
  * **Cheaper for owner to bear the risk because he participates in the outdoor arena every night; on average he has the same number of likely rainy days a year and can plan for these**  
    * **If there is someone in a transaction who can bear the risk more efficiently, they should do it**  
    * **Can be comfortable with the transaction based on the average in a way that the other parties cannot**  
      * **Set the price of the 365 concerts at a point where you factor in 60 rained out concerts a year**  
    * **Benefits from diversification across days**  
      * **Performer and ticket holder are not positioned to benefit from diversification**

- **When you allocate any risk:**  
  * **The person that knows more about the product (asymmetric information) should bear the risk because they can price it better**  
  *  **Even if no one knows about the product (uncertainty), there is still a party that is going to have a comparative advantage**  
    * **In this case, as in others, diversification benefits one party which allows them to bear the risk**

4\. You are considering buying stock in either Autoco or Carco.  They make similar products (automobiles) and are otherwise similar, except for this difference: The executives in Autoco all own stock in Autoco, but the executives in Carco do not own stock in Carco.  Why might this difference be significant?

- **Agency Cost: Risk for people managing the company to not run the business as best as they can if they do not own the business**  
  * **Equity compensation aligns incentives (VC), dealing with incentive problem**

5\. You are the chief executive officer (“CEO”) of Bigco, a publicly-traded firm.  You are thinking about buying a corporate jet.  The business of the company does not require it, but you think “I’m the boss, I deserve it.”  The jet costs the company $10 million, and you will derive pleasure worth 1% of that, or $100,000.  

1. Will shareholders want you to buy the jet? If not, how much influence to public shareholders have over this sort of issue? Who else might be in a position to stop you?

- No. You are taking $10M to get $100K satisfaction. This is inefficient  
- Public shareholders do not have influence over the hiring of CEO’s  
- The BoD might have influence to police CEO

2. If you are not a shareholder, is it beneficial to you personally to buy the jet? What is this type of incentive problem called? (See the excerpt from Gilson & Baums above.)  
- Yes. $100K of value you didn’t have before  
- Agency cost

3. If you own 2% of the company’s outstanding stock, is it beneficial to you personally to buy the jet?  
- No. The CEO bears 2% of $10M \= $200K  
  * Spending $200K of CEO’s own money to get $100K of value is not efficient

4. Can equity compensation be a response to agency costs?

- **Equity compensation addresses agency costs by turning company expenses into personal expenses and potential company profits into personal potential profits**

6\. You are the chief executive officer of Bigco, whose stock price currently is $100 per share. You have worked there your entire career, and you are well respected in the business world for your successes.  As a result, you constantly receive other offers to work elsewhere \-- something you appreciate \-- but you have turned them down.  

A. One of your senior managers brings you the following proposal.  If you invest all of Bigco’s assets in a new technology (the “Venture”), it could pay off very well.  Specifically, there is a 50% chance that the company’s stock price will be worth $500.  On the other hand, if Venture does not succeed, the company will become bankrupt (so the stock will be worth $0). If you proceed with Venture, what would your stock price be worth to risk neutral investors? How does that compare with the stock’s current value of $100?

- A shareholder will want the company to do this because 50% chance of $500 \= $250; While 50% chance of $0 \= $0  
- The stock price should jump from $100 to $250 after this deal  
  * Because the stock price is basically a lottery ticket for $500 or $0 \= $250 value  
  * From the perspective of the diversified shareholder, this is appealing

  C. If the company enters bankruptcy, what would the CEO lose? Do you think the CEO is likely to be more or less enthusiastic about making the risky new investment? Is there a potential agency cost here?

- But the CEO is less likely to do this because their professional reputation is at stake and their income (job) is at stake – they are less diversified than the shareholder  
- **The shareholder’s perspective should matter (executive is just the agent of the owner), but their incentives are not aligned**  
  * This is an agency cost

  D. Assume that CEO has been receiving $3 million in cash each year, but the compensation package is changed to $2.5 million in cash and 10,000 shares of Bigco stock (currently worth $1 million if Bigco). If Bigco proceeds with Venture, how much would the stock be worth if the investment succeeds? What if it fails? Under the new compensation package, will the risky investment seem more or less attractive to the CEO?

- CEO is more willing to take extra risk because the upside is a concrete number to them  
- **Equity compensation encourages risk taking from executives**  
  * **This can align shareholders’ risk tolerance with executives’ risk tolerance**

7\. Assume that the stock of Company is currently trading at $60. Assume also that the S\&P 500 Stock Index is trading at $6,000 (to pick a round number). Assume that Company grants Executive 100,000 options to buy Company stock at $60 any time during the next ten years. 

1. Assume that ten years later, Company’s stock price has increased by just over 10% to $66. How much does Executive earn from these options?

- $600K

2. Assume also that ten years later, the S\&P 500 has increased by 50% to $9,000. How happy do you think shareholders are with Company’s performance?  
- Not happy because the market as a whole did better than the increase in Company’s stock price  
- Even though the performance was disappointing, executive will still get $600K

3. Assume that ten years later, the S\&P 500 has declined by 50%, and is $3,000. Company’s stock price is still $60. How happy do you think shareholders are with Company’s performance?  
- Very happy shareholders because Company beat the market by 50%, but Executive earned $0 from the options

4. Do you think the options given to Executive are structured in the right way to create the incentives shareholders want Executive to have? Are there any problems you would like to fix?

- **Options are not well structured because it does not accurately reward/penalize Executive for Company’s performance in comparison to the rest of the market**

8\. Like in the question above, assume that the stock of Company is currently trading at $60. Assume also that the S\&P 500 Stock Index is trading at $6,000. But instead of granting Executive 100,000 options to buy Company stock for $60 (a “conventional option”), Company offers an “**Indexed Option**” instead. Under this “Indexed Option,” Executive has the right to buy Company stock at any time during the next 10 years \-- not for the fixed price of $60--but for 1/100 of the value of the S\&P 500 Stock Index on the date of the purchase. \[**Price Executive can exercise his option at \= (Price in 10 years of S\&P)/100**\]

1. Assume that ten years later, Company’s stock price has increased by 10% to $66 and the S\&P 500 has increased by 50% to $9,000. How much money (if any) would Executive make in exercising his 100,000 options? Does this result seem appropriate?

- Option price \= $90  
  * Executive is not going to exercise his options because he bought them for $60. He is not going to pay $90 for something worth $60  
- **There is no payout in a situation where Company got outperformed by the market**

2. Assume that ten years later, Company’s stock price is still $60 and the S\&P 500 has declined by 50% to $3,000. How much money (if any) would Executive make in exercising his 100,000 options? Does this result seem appropriate?  
- Option price \= $30  
  * Executive will exercise his options because he will pay $30 for something worth $60  
- **Indexed option rewards Company for outperforming market**

3. If you served on a board of directors and were named the chair of the compensation committee, would you favor granting conventional options or indexed options?

- Favor indexed options because they more properly align incentives  
- Rare for companies to use them because they are complicated  
- **Compensation, properly structured, is a standard effort to solve incentive problems**

# 2: Tax Planning

- 2 Similar Situations treated differently is common but not a good thing 🡪 Regulatory Arbitrage  
  * **Tax planning: Find economically similar situations taxed differently**  
    * **Variations of this:**  
      * **Exclusions – Sources of economic that are not taxed at all**  
      * **Valuation – Sources of economic value that should be valued (and taxed) lower**  
      * **Conversion – Different kinds of income taxed differently (rather have capital gain than ordinary income)**  
      * **Deferral – If you have to pay the same amount, it is better to pay that later instead of now so you can hold onto your money, invest it, and make more money**  
        * **Effectively an interest-free loan from government**  
      * **Shifting – Move income from higher paying taxpayer to lower**  
        * Works with progressive rates  
        * Can work with multinational corporations  
          * US incorporated parent and Irish subsidiary  
          * Earning money by selling to US consumers but still pay tax in Ireland because you take loans from Irish subsidiaries, pay them royalties  
          * Shifting profit from US to Ireland  
    * Remember, frictions and all parties too

- Information and incentive problems arise in every transaction and it is lawyers’ role to act so they don’t prevent transactions from happening

1. Our last class ended with a discussion of executive compensation. Let’s continue with that topic, but we now turn to the other theme of this class: **regulatory arbitrage**. **Economically similar arrangements are sometimes treated differently**. **This can happen because regulatory regimes are poorly drafted, not perfectly conceptualized, or require compromises to be administrable**. This class uses U.S. tax law as a recurring case study of this more general point. 

   As an illustrative example, assume that Emma Employee works for Barbara Boss. Assume also that the tax rate for each of them is 50% in order to keep the numbers round. (The top federal rate for individuals in the U.S. actually is 37%.)

   1. When Barbara pays Emma a salary of $100,000, does Emma pay tax on it?  
- Yes. $50K in tax

  2. Someone who receives a gift is not taxed under U.S. law, so Emma makes the following suggestion to Barbara. “From now on, instead of paying me $100,000 in salary, why don’t you pay me $80,000? And on my birthday, you can give me a $20,000 gift.” Would this reduce her tax bill? (There is a special rules under U.S. law treating gifts from employees as taxable, but please ignore this rule in answering this question.)  
- Yes, she would pay $40K in tax  
- **This is an economically similar situation (same total salary amount) with different tax treatment**  
- But in reality gifts from your employer are always taxable

  3. Do you agree with the following statement? “**When economically similar arrangements are treated differently, a change in the way the transaction is structured can yield dramatically better (or worse) treatment**.”  
- True.

2. Let’s now view this situation from Barbara’s perspective, since Emma is not the only one who might be affected by her idea.  
   1. Assume that Barbara brings in $300,000 in revenue for the work that she and Emma do together. Does Barbara pay tax on the entire $300,000? What does the term “deduction” mean? Can an employer deduct salary payments?  
- She does not pay tax on the entire $300K  
- She can deduct the salary payments of $100K and other expenses she incurs in generating the revenue. She is taxed on $200K  
- **A deduction is an amount taken out of your gross income which you will be taxed on**  
  * **You can subtract the cost of earning income so you are only taxed on profit**

  2. Can Barbara deduct the $20,000 gift? (By analogy, do you expect to be able to deduct the cost of a wedding present that you give your friend? Or a birthday present you give your mother?)  
- Gifts are not deductible  
  * Money deducted must be for the generation of income

  3. How, if at all, would Barbara be affected if she agrees to Emma’s request to receive an $80,000 salary and a $20,000 gift, instead of a $100,000 salary? Would Barbara change her own tax bill?  
- Barbara would pay more in taxes because she cannot deduct the $20K gift in the new proposal  
  * She pays an extra $10K in taxes  
  * Emma saves $10K in taxes  
    * **The tax savings to Emma is matched by an $10K increase in tax to Barbara**  
    * **Benefit to one perfectly offsets cost to another**

  4. Do you agree with the following statement? “**In deciding whether a tax strategy should be implemented, tax planners cannot focus on only one party to the transaction. Instead, they need to think about the tax implications for *all* parties**.”  
- True.

  5. Assume that Barbara lives in another country, which allows employers to deduct the cost of gifts to employees. Would this affect Barbara’s willingness to accept Emma’s proposal to earn only $80,000 in salary and to receive a $20,000 gift?  
- Yes, Barabara would be more willing to pay Emma with the part salary part gift transaction because it doesn’t cost her anything  
- Different rules change the result

  6. The same facts as in “e.” What if Barbara suggested $80,000 of salary and a $15,000 gift? Would Emma prefer that to $100,000 of salary? Why would Barbara prefer this?  
- In this situation, Emma’s after-tax income is $55K. This is better than the $50K of after-tax income she would have if she accepted $100K of pure salary  
- In this situation, Barbara can deduct $80K from her taxes and pays Emma $95K. This is better than deducting $100K and paying Emma $100K  
  * By switching to an approach where you are giving part salary part gift, you are reducing Emma’s taxes  
  * Barbara is sharing the tax savings (reduction of $5K in salary in exchange for $5K in tax savings)  
    * **If only one party in the transaction collects the tax benefit, they may not keep the entire benefit. The other party, if needed to cooperate to do it, will share the surplus**

  7. Do you agree with the following statement? “**When parties to a transaction can restructure it to generate more favorable tax treatment for one of the parties, they are likely to share the tax benefit. So even if only one of the parties can claim the benefit, they are likely to adjust the pre-tax cash flows to share this benefit with others, whose cooperation is needed to generate the tax benefit**.”

- Yes.

3. **Exclusion / Valuation:** The planning discussed in questions 1 & 2 takes advantage of **exclusions**. Taxpayers strive to improve their economic situation in ways that are not included in “gross income” for tax purposes (e.g., a gift). Planners also take advantage of **opportunities to understate the value of what a taxpayer has received, effectively excluding a portion of this value**.  
   1. Continuing with the saga of Emma, assume she works for ABC Co and her salary is $100k. Emma needs a car, and a new one costs $40k. If Emma asks ABC Co to cut her salary to $60k, and to buy her a $40k new car, do you think her tax treatment changes? In other words, if someone is paid with goods or services, instead of cash, are they taxed on the value of the goods and services?  
- Emma’s tax treatment will not change. She is still taxed on $100K because goods and services as salary are taxable  
  * **The fact that you aren’t paid in cash does not mean you do not pay tax. You are taxed on the value of these goods and services**  
- **Exclusion \= A source of value that you do not pay tax on**

  2. Emma reads an article, which says that new cars lose 20% of their value as soon as they are driven off the lot (because they become used cars, so their quality becomes more suspect). So Emma changes the request in “a.”: “Please pay me $60k in cash and a car. But instead of letting me pick it up from the dealer, ABC should buy it, keep it for a week (without using it), and then give it to me.” What is Emma’s goal in making this suggestion?  
- **Emma is trying to reduce her tax bill by lowering the value of the car when she receives it**  
- She will be taxed on $60K cash \+ the value of the used car (instead of the new one) which will be around $32K (20% of $40K new car is lost) 

  3. Let’s consider the effect on ABC. If the car is worth $30k when they transfer it to Emma, how much is their compensation deduction?  
- $30K  
- This situation is equally bad for ABC as it is good for Emma

  4. Is there an additional deduction that ABC might claim here? (Hint: Did they lose money on the car?)  
- ABC can claim $10K of depreciation on loss on car (Paid $40K and gave to her with $30K \= $10K loss)  
  * Employer gets a $100K total deduction, while employee gets $90K salary to be taxed on  
- **Valuation \= Manage valuation decreases tax bill**

4. **Conversion:** Another type of tax planning strives to **convert income that the tax system classifies unfavorably to income that is classified more favorably**.

   1. In the U.S., there are two types of income. One is “ordinary income,” which includes salary income. The maximum rate is 37% under current law. The other is “capital gain,” which generally is a taxpayer’s profit from an investment. (This is oversimplified, but it is approximately right). The maximum rate for capital gain is 23.8%. Which income would a taxpayer usually rather receive?

- Capital gain

  2. Emma (from the questions above) thinks the stock of ABC Co. is going to appreciate in value. She spends $10k of her $100k salary to buy stock (100 shares at $100 per share). The stock appreciates to $15k, so she sells it for a $5k profit. Is her profit taxed as capital gain or ordinary income?  
- $5K capital gain if she held it for a year or more

  3. Instead of receiving cash and using it to buy stock, Emma asks ABC to reduce her cash salary by $10k (to $90k) and to give her 100 shares of ABC (worth $10k). ABC agrees, but with a condition: Emma keeps this stock only if she continues to work for the company for 12 months. After 12 months, the stock is worth $15k. How is the stock taxed? (Hint: When employees receive stock or other property subject to “vesting”—that is, they don’t keep it unless they satisfy the condition, which often is about staying in their jobs—they don’t pay tax until the property vests, and then they pay tax based on its value at the time it vests.)  
- Without the vesting component, this is all treated as cash salary because what matters is how you earned it  
  * **If you get property from your employer in exchange for services, you are taxed as if you earned cash – ordinary**  
  * **If that property appreciates, you are taxed as if you invested in that property – capital gain**

- **If you get something subject to vesting, you do not pay tax until the condition is satisfied. The amount of tax is determined by the value at the time the condition is satisfied**  
  * When you get property in your job (stock) which is subject to vesting, you pay tax later when it vests  
  * Retention device  
- **$90K ordinary initially; $15K ordinary after one year when it vests (treated at vesting as if she just got all the stock now for services)**  
  * **This is bad for Emma because the $5K increase in the stock is treated as ordinary income (because condition has not yet been satisfied), but if it could have been treated as capital gain if she didn’t have the vesting condition because it is property that increased in value**  
- Increases her tax bill by converting $5K from capital gain to ordinary income

  4. U.S. tax law offers someone in Emma’s position a choice. If she receives property subject to a vesting requirement, she can make a so-called “**83(b) election,” which allows her to pay tax on the value of the property when she receives it—not when it vests. Any gain (or loss) after that is treated as capital gain (or loss)**. If Emma expects the stock to increase in value (e.g., from $100 to $150 per share), should she make an 83(b) election? Is this a conversion strategy?  
- Emma should make an 83(b) election to convert a portion of her salary to capital gain  
  * She pays her tax early based on the value of what it is initially worth before she has received it  
  * All gain later is capital gain  
  * This places her back in the position as if there was no vesting condition

- If stock decreases, this is bad because you will have capital losses (where you would rather have ordinary)  
- If you use the 83(b) election and quit so you don’t have the vested stock, you paid ordinary income tax on the stock’s value, and now you have a capital loss that is the amount of the stock that you lost

- To take advantage of the 83(b) election, taxpayer needs to elect, have the stock vest, and have the stock go up

  5. An employer deducts the same amount that an employee includes. So what is ABC’s deduction in “c” (i.e., when Emma does not make an 83(b) election)? What about in “e” (when Emma does make this election)? Which is better for the employer?  
- No 83(b) election \= $105K deduction ($15K for stock)  
- 83(b) election \= $100K deduction ($10K for stock)  
- **If the stock increases, 83(b) elections are bad for the employer  (reduces deduction) and good for the employee (reduces ordinary income)**  
  * **All parties aspect – It is up to the employee (which binds the employer) if the employer chooses to include the vesting condition**

- **One of the ways to improve tax treatment is by reclassifying income into a favored category (conversion – capital gain over ordinary)**  
    
- **Tax planning \= Look for economically similar situations that are taxed differently**  
  * **Exclusion/Valuation**  
  * **Conversion – Changing the kind of income that it is**  
  * **Deferral**  
  * **Shifting**

5. **Deferral:** Another type of tax planning defers a tax. Let’s consider why is deferral valuable and how it is achieved.  
   1. Assume that your neighbor needs $10,000 to pay a bill. She is expecting a $10,000 payment to come in one year, but until then she is short of money. You, on the other hand, have $10,000 on hand. She asks to borrow the money from you.  
      1. What concerns, if any, might you have in making this loan?  
- Credit risk \= Might not get it back  
- Liquidity risk \= Might need the cash  
- Interest

  2. If you make this loan, will you do it for free?  
- No.  
- The use of money that is not yours is going to cost you something

  2. In general, why do taxpayers prefer to pay a tax next year, instead of this year (assuming the relevant tax rate does not change)?  
- **Tax deferral is an interest-free loan from the government, reducing the present value of the tax. Impact of deferral depends on:**  
  * **1\) Interest rates: Higher interest rates \= Lower Present Value of the tax**  
    * **This is the payment, the interest, you are avoiding**  
  * **2\) Time: Longer period \= Lower Present Value of the tax**  
    * **More time to invest without paying lender**

  3. You anticipate having to pay a $10,000 bill in one year. For simplicity’s sake, assume that your marginal tax rate is 50% and (quite unrealistically) that interest rates are 10%.  
     1. You decide to invest money today in order to fund this $10,000 obligation in one year Do you need to invest $10,000 today? More? Less?  
- Less. It will grow

  2. If you invest $9,524, what will your pretax return be after one year (assuming you earn 10%)? What will you have left after paying a 50% tax on this interest income?  
- Interest income \= $952.4  
- After-tax interest income \= $476.2  
- Total Investment \= $10,000.2  
  * 10% interest rate and 50% tax \= 5% after-tax interest rate

    3. What is the present value of $10,000 in one year, assuming a discount rate of 5%?  
- $9,524

  4. What if the obligation to pay is in two years, instead of in one year? Do you still have to set aside $9,524? If not, would you have to set aside more or less?  
- Less.

  5. How much will you have in two years if you set aside $9070 today?  
- $9,999.68

  4. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: “**Deferring a tax reduces its present value**.”  
- Correct.

  5. Is tax deferral more or less powerful as the deferral period grows? In other words, from the taxpayer’s perspective, is deferring a tax for two years better or worse than deferring it for one year (assuming the nominal amount of the tax does not change)?  
- Deferral is more powerful as the deferral period grows

- The longer the time, the lower the present value  
- The higher the interest rate, the lower the present value

- Deferral lowers the present value of the tax. Its impact depends on:  
  * Time – Longer period \= Lower present value  
  * Interest Rate – Higher interest rate \= Lower present value

  6. The same problem as above, but interest rates are 2%, instead of 10%. After paying the 50% tax on your interest income, how much will you have in one year if you set aside $9,901 today?  
- Interest income \= $198  
- After-tax interest income \= $99  
- Total Investment \= $10,000

  7. What is the present value of $10,000 in one year, assuming a discount rate of 1%?  
- $9,901

  8. Is tax deferral more or less powerful as interest rates rise?  
- Deferral is more powerful as interest rates rise  
  * You can invest deferred money that would otherwise be for taxes and make more with higher interest rates

  9. Fran is an independent contractor, who is doing some freelance editing for George. As a “cash method” taxpayer, Fran owes tax on income only after she receives it. Fran has worked quite a number of hours, and is going to receive a significant payment. In late November, Fran mentions to you that she is about to send an invoice for this payment. What tax advice can you offer about the timing of when she should send this invoice?  
- Fran should send the invoice in January so that she can defer tax on this income until the following year

6. **Shifting:** Another type of tax planning shifts income from one taxpayer to another.  
   1. Diane is an investment banker, whose marginal income is taxed in the 37% bracket. Diane’s son, Eric, is a high school teacher, whose marginal income is taxed in the 22% bracket. Diane owns a portfolio of bonds, which pays $10,000 of interest each year. She wants to use this money to help Eric. What is her after-tax income from these bonds?  
- Diane after-tax interest income from bonds \= $6,300

  2. Instead of giving Eric her after-tax interest on the bonds, she considers giving him the bonds. When he receives the $10,000 interest payment, how much tax would Eric pay? How much would he have after paying this tax?  
- Eric tax on interest income \= $2,200  
- Eric after-tax interest income from bonds \= $7,800  
  * **By shifting the income to Eric, the collective tax bill between the two parties is reduced**  
  * **Shifting only exists in a system that uses different progressive rates**

  3. Either way, Diane is dedicating the return from this bond portfolio to Eric. Which of these alternatives reduces their combined tax liability and gets Eric the most money?  
- Giving the bonds to Eric reduces the combined tax liability and gets Eric the most money

  4. Are there reasons (having nothing to do with tax) why Diane might hesitate to adopt this tax planning strategy?  
- Yes. Diane will have to relinquish control over the bonds and might be nervous Eric will sell the bonds or do something irresponsible with them  
  * Additionally, if Diane needs the money from the bonds in the future she cannot access them

- **In tax planning, there are frictions (non-tax costs like giving control over) that would make taxpayers not choose the most tax efficient result**

7. **Shifting: Multinationals**. Parent, a U.S. company, sells phones to U.S. consumers, charging $500 per phone. The phones cost $100 to manufacture and another $100 in marketing and distribution costs, netting a $300 profit.

- **Businesses desire to earn money in districts with a lower tax rate**  
  * **This is a form of shifting**

  1. Absent any tax planning, the $300 will be taxed currently in the U.S. How much tax must Parent pay, assuming the U.S. corporate tax rate is 21%.  
- Tax per phone \= $63

  2. Parent incorporates a wholly owned subsidiary in Ireland, called IrishSub. The corporate tax in Ireland is 12.5%. (It may increase to 15% under a recent agreement, but the timing and details of this change are unclear.). Is Parent better off shifting income to IrishSub?  
- Yes. Parent will pay $37.5 in tax per phone if IrishSub reports this income

  3. Parent borrows funds from IrishSub and pays $100 of tax deductible interest per phone to IrishSub. How much taxable income does Parent now have in the U.S.? How much does it have in Ireland? By how much has Parent reduced its overall tax bill? (Assume that the U.S. does not tax IrishSub’s income, and that this tax would be triggered only if IrishSub pays a dividend to Parent. This used to be the rule in the U.S.)  
- Profit on phones \= $300 per phone  
- Taxable Income in US after $100 per phone loan \= $200 per phone  
- Taxable Income in Ireland \= $100 per phone  
- If $100 was taxable in US 🡪 Parent pays $21 per phone  
- But $100 is taxable in Ireland 🡪 Parent pays $12.5 per phone  
- Overall reduction in tax bill \= $8.5 per phone

- **Companies will take loans from their subsidiaries in low tax jurisdictions to lower their tax rates, shifting the taxable value of the loan to the lower tax jurisdiction**

  4. When Parent developed the current version of its phones, it included a number of technological innovations, which are patented. Although the engineers developing these innovations work in California, they work for IrishSub, which is responsible for coordinating Parent’s research. Assume Parent starts paying a $150 royalty to IrishSub for each phone it sells in the U.S. (Assume that Parent is also paying the interest described in part “c.”) How much taxable income does Parent have in the U.S.? How much taxable income does IrishSub have in Ireland? Through these strategies, how much is the multinational reducing its total tax bill (including both Irish & U.S. taxes)?  
- Taxable Income in US \= $50 income per phone  
- Taxable Income in Ireland \= $250 income per phone  
- If $250 was taxable in US 🡪 Parent pays $52.5 per phone  
- But $250 is taxable in Ireland 🡪 Parent pays $31.25 per phone  
- Overall reduction in tax bill \= $21.25 per phone

- **Multinationals shift income from higher portions of the corporate structure to lower portions of their business without changing business structure**

  5. How do changes in the U.S. corporate tax rate affect a multinational’s incentive to engage in this shifting? For example, the U.S. corporate rate used to be 35%, and Congress reduced it to 21% in 2017\. Do you think that change reduced or increased the incentive of multinationals to shift income?  
- As the U.S. corporate tax rate becomes higher, multinational’s incentives to engage in shifting increase  
- This 2017 change reduced the incentive of multinationals to shift income

8. **Frictions: In analyzing whether tax planning is effective, we have to consider non-tax costs associated with the planning strategy, which economists call “frictions.” If those costs exceed the tax savings, a taxpayer will not pursue the strategy.**   
1. Recall the example of Fran, the independent contractor. What nontax costs might persuade her not to take your tax advice?  
- She needs the money now  
  * Maybe she needs to pay off credit card interest which would be higher than the tax savings  
    * Cost of the tax planning is too high because she had to pay the credit card interest

- If the goal is to minimize taxes 🡪 Wait to get the invoice in next year  
- If the goal is to maximize after-tax returns 🡪 Get the money now, forgo the tax planning, and pay off the credit card

- **Frictions: Cannot just look at tax in isolation**  
  * **The point is to have the most money at the end of the day considering all other goals**  
    * **Frictions are the other goals**

2. Recall the example of Diane, who is deciding whether to give the bond portfolio to her son, Eric. What is the most tax efficient step for her to take? Again, why might she not take this step (for nontax reasons)?  
- Most tax efficient step would be to give the portfolio to Eric, but she might not do this because she does not want to relinquish control of it  
  * There is a tax savings, but the non-tax cost (relinquishing control) dominates. Her goal is not to minimize taxes but to get to the lowest tax paid in light of all her goals

3. Recall the multinational that manufactures phones. Under current law, Parent’s engineers live in California, but Parent can shift the value from their work to Ireland, where it is taxed at a lower rate. What if Congress changed the law, requiring the engineers to work in Ireland in order for profits from their work to be taxed there? Would that matter?  
- That would matter because engineers might not want to move there  
  * The company might have to pay to move employees relocation  
  * The company might also lose talent  
  * These non-tax goals offset the cost

4. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? “**The goal of tax planning is not to minimize taxes, but to maximize after-tax returns**.”  
- True.


9. **All Parties:** As review, remember that **when analyzing whether tax planning is effective, we have to consider all parties to the transaction**.  
   1. Recall the example of Fran, the independent contractor. For tax reasons, she cares when she receives the payment. What about George, who is the one *making* this payment. Assume that he is also a cash method taxpayer, and that the payment is a business expense that he can deduct. Does he have a preference about timing? Is it the same as Fran’s preference?  
- George has a timing preference to pay in the current year because he can take an immediate deduction, reducing the present value of his tax  
- This is the opposite of Fran’s preference

- **The tax strategy that works for one party in the transaction may not work for all parties in the transaction**

  2. If Fran and George are in the same tax bracket, what tax advantage, if any, is there for them to adjust the timing of the payment?  
- There is no tax advantage to adjusting the timing of the payment

  3. What if Fran is doing this work for a nonprofit (e.g., a university)? Does that change the analysis?  
- If Fran is working for a nonprofit that would change the analysis because the nonprofit does not pay income tax so they have no preference when to deduct. Therefore, it would benefit Fran to include the income in the following year and make no difference to the nonprofit when it is included

  4. Have you heard the phrase “tax accommodation party” or “tax indifferent party”? Can you think of an example of one?  
- Tax Accommodation Party/Tax Indifferent Party (TIP) \= Timing of Inclusions/Deductions does not matter  
  * Native American Tribes  
  * Dutch banks  
  * Nonprofits

# 3: Residential Real Property (DD, Allocating Costs, Tax)

- Different aspects to a residential purchase. But fundamental problem is asymmetric information  
  * Seller knows more than buyer about the house  
- Can get third party monitor  
  * Home inspection  
- Due diligence process  
  * You ask questions, they answer  
  * **Sometimes what you learn is not the answer itself but lack of confidence from inconsistencies in other party’s answers which signals concerns**  
- Who should bear the costs of due diligence?  
  * **Need a principle to justify why the other party should bear the cost**  
    * Buyer should bear: This is a unique thing Buyer wants so they need to bear the cost  
      * Key is to ask, is this something anyone would ask for?  
        * Tank Unhealthy: Seller should bear it because all buyers will notice it and all buyers care  
        * Personal color preference: Buyer should bear. This is what it means to buy something. Then you can do whatever you want with it  
      * Other key question is, will others know?  
        * Can seller mask this to other buyers? If so, buyer more likely to bear the cost  
      * **Two components to getting seller to bear the cost:**  
        * **Future buyers need to know**  
        * **Future buyers need to care**  
    * Seller should bear: This is under seller’s control. Seller can do it at lower cost  
- What if there is information that is not available yet?  
  * This creates a challenge when one party is looking to close sooner rather than later  
  * Easiest action is to delay the closing  
  * **But if one party wants to close earlier, this is a source of negotiating power for the other side that doesn’t have the time pressure**  
  * Well, can the seller find another buyer?  
    * Yes, but this takes weeks. Have to restart due diligence process  
  * So buyer can:  
    * Assume the system doesn’t work and get credit for it  
    * But seller will want a contingent purchase price ($15K less at closing but $15K more when the systems can be tested and confirmed are working)  
      * Challenge: Will seller actually bring a lawsuit to collect the $15K? Probably not.  
        * Solution: Escrow account. Lawyers make judgment to release money to buyer or seller depending on if the system works or not  
      * Other challenge: The money is to fix the problems with the system but not aesthetic. Appearance is responsibility of the buyer. This tracks the question, “will another future buyer care”. **Need to be clear on language. Also, need to look ahead to situations to see what situations would arise where each side might have an argument as to saying it is functional/aesthetic so it can be drafted/agreed upon ahead of time**  
        * Functional 🡪 Seller pays  
        * Aesthetic 🡪 Buyer pays

- Real estate has:  
  * Asymmetric information, incentive problems  
  * Regulatory arbitrage tax planning opportunities

1. Bob Buyer wants to buy a weekend house. You are Bob’s lawyer. He sees a property that he really likes in Pretty County, which is 50 miles away from his year-round home. Susan Seller’s asking price is $1.1 million. Bob offers $950,000 and they settle on a price of $1,030,000. Susan is represented by Linda Lawyer.

   Before signing a contract, Bob needs your help with due diligence on the house, which was built in 1957\. An important issue is that most houses built then were heated by oil and had oil tanks buried underground. In newer houses, oil tanks are no longer buried underground because of concerns about contaminating soil and groundwater. Buyers looking at older houses sometimes hire experts, who use metal detectors to look for underground tanks. This inspection costs approximately $1,000. If a tank is found, the market practice is for sellers to bear the expense of removing it, which costs about $5,000, but can be significantly more if the tank has leaked and the soil needs to be remediated.

   

   In the property disclosure form, which sellers provide to anyone looking at a house, Susan answered “no” to the question, “Is there an underground oil tank?”

   

   Before signing a contract to buy the house, Bob hires Ira Inspector to look for potential defects in it. In his inspection report, Ira observes that the oil tank currently is in the garage. But he sees pipes going from the garage into the ground, which is a sign that there could be an old oil tank there. “I’m pretty sure there was an underground tank,” Ira tells Bob. “Otherwise, what are those pipes for?”

   Bob relays this question to Susan, who answers: “There aren’t any pipes.” When Bob sends a picture, Susan answers: “I don’t know, but maybe those pipes lead to a propane tank. We use propane to heat the pool.” Ira says that this doesn’t make sense, since the pool is quite a distance from the garage. 

   

   Susan follows up with another email: “Spoke to the oil company that has supplied oil to the house since I bought it. They re-used the tank that was there and relocated to existing location. Neither I nor they have any knowledge of an underground tank. Further, during construction, we excavated around the entire house and none was found.”

   Bob wonders where the tank was before it was moved. Was it underground, so that it might have left contaminants in the soil? Through his broker, Bob asks Susan whether the tank that was relocated used to be underground. Susan replies: “When we bought the house in 1992, the oil tank was in the original garage and was above ground. When we expanded the house, we knocked down the garage and built the new one and relocated the tank to where it is today.”

   

   Bob asks Susan whether she would put a representation in the contract, saying that there is no oil tank and if one is later found, she will pay to clean up any environmental damage. Susan says that all she would say in the contract is, “To the best of my knowledge, there is no underground tank,” and that this representation would “not survive the closing.” This means that if one is found after closing, she is not responsible for any harm it might have caused.

   1. Based on these responses, do you think Bob should conduct a scan for an old underground oil tank?  
- Yes, Susan’s explanation for the no oil tank is changing. She is slippery, making excuses  
  * **People are smart enough not to admit something they do not want you to know, but if you keep asking the same question in different ways and you are getting inconsistent answers, then this makes it look questionable**  
- **You can’t investigate every issue but you can investigate some. Therefore, to figure out which ones to look into, you want to see if there are inconsistent answers regarding one issue**  
  * **Also, Susan is not willing to take responsibility for the possibility of the tank**

  2. Do you think it is reasonable for Bob to ask Susan to bear some of the cost of the scan? As Bob’s lawyer, please offer arguments explaining why Susan should share in the cost.  
- Yes. Susan should bear some of the cost because it is an important component to understanding Bob’s liability and thus a pre-requisite for him buying the house. Additionally, Susan will not give the representation that Bob asked for  
- This might protect both parties’ interests

- **If you are so sure that there is no tank, give a real representation**  
  * **If you say “best of your knowledge” that looks like you are not sure**  
- **The answers Susan has given are flawed, inconsistent**  
  * **Expose Susan for not having full information (she said there are no pipes, but I found pipes)**  
- **Eventually, could compromise. Bob could cover the cost of the scan and if he finds a tank, Susan bears the cost of removing it and the scan**  
  * **You should agree to this because you said there is no tank**  
    * **Their comfort with paying for the tank if there is one will tell you how confident they are there isn’t one**

- **You can learn just by the effort to get information the comfort level the other party has (if their story keeps changing, inconsistent replies)**  
- **During negotiation, the positions the other party takes can shed light on things too (why are you only willing to represent “to the best of your knowledge” if you actually know)**

  3. Assume that Bob does a scan and finds an oil tank, and Susan agrees to remove it. How might this interaction affect Bob’s dealings with Susan on other issues?  
- Bob will trust Susan less in future dealings when Susan makes claims about the property  
  * **One party misleading will create distrust on what else there is in terms of other problems with the deal** 🡪 Bob should get a significant discount or walk from the transaction

2. The same facts as in problem 1\. While inspecting the property, Ira notices another issue: the current oil tank (which, as noted above, is in the garage) is not installed properly. Exhaust fumes are not vented out of the garage. Since the garage is attached to the house, Ira says there is a risk that exhaust fumes will vent into the house, something he says is unhealthy and potentially dangerous.  
   1. What should Bob’s position be about the venting issue with the current oil tank?  
- Bob must ask Susan to fix the tank before move-in at her expense or at least compensate him after closing for costs to fix the tank’s ventilation himself  
  * Why should Susan pay?  
    * Health matter – Regulations will require it  
    * Bob will walk without this fix  
    * **Not just Bob but all future buyers will want this fixed. Therefore, Susan will have to fix this to sell to anyone**  
      * Not just I want this but everyone who is in my position will want this

  2. Assume that Bob does not like the color and appearance of the oil tank. Is it likely that Susan will bear the expense of replacing it? Is the analysis the same as the request in “a” about venting the tank?  
- No. Venting of the tank is a safety hazard that is necessary to purchasing a home. Color and appearance of the tank are less important  
  * Color and appearance are specific to Bob’s aesthetic preference. Unlike health where the preferences are general, the preferences here are unique to this one party

- **Unique preferences (color) 🡪 Seller does not have to do it or discount because future buyers will not require this**  
- **General preferences (health) 🡪 Seller will have to do it or discount because future buyers will require this so to sell at all, seller must fix**  
    
3. The same facts as in problem 1\. Ira also finds mold growing in the crawl space under the house. This means there are likely to be mold spores in the air inside the house, something that is not healthy for anyone but is especially an issue for Bob and his family, who have allergies and various respiratory problems.   
     
   Ira outlines two steps to eliminate the mold. First, the area must be cleaned thoroughly by professionals who specialize in remediating mold. This step costs approximately $5,000. Second, to prevent growth of mold in the future, a pump must be installed to remove water from below the house and a dehumidifier must be installed to remove moisture in the air. This step costs $2,000.  
     
   In response, Susan says, “That’s not mold. It’s just a discoloration, which has been there since we bought the house thirty years ago. If it bothers you, I will ask my housekeeper to scrub it thoroughly with bleach and paint over it.”   
     
1. If Bob walks away from this deal, will other buyers care as much about the mold as Bob?  
- They will not care as much about the mold because they do not have the same health pre-dispositions, but they still should care  
  * Suggests that Bob can get Susan to pay for some but not all of it

2. If Bob walks away, is another buyer likely to detect the mold?  
- This is important because to have Susan do it, Bob needs to show Susan that other buyers will know about the issue, and they will also ask for the same thing  
- Susan will have a chance to paint over it, making it for another buyer to detect the mold  
  * Susan’s ability to paint over it in the future will undercut Bob’s position in the negotiation because future buyers will not be able to detect and be placed in Bob’s position  
- **The issue that, once identified, is easier to conceal from the next buyer harms the current buyer’s position**

- Note: Poor ventilation, mold is uninteresting if you are a buyer who wants to tear down the house and build something new. Susan might want to hold out for someone who won’t care about any of these issues and is going to tear down  
  * But then again someone who is looking to tear down the house, is buying just the land so the price will probably be lower than the person who wants to keep the house

3. Assuming that Susan does the same analysis of “a” and “b,” what do you expect her position to be? Will she be willing to address this issue?  
- Susan should address this issue by bearing some but not all of the cost. Clearly, the mold does not bother her as much as it would bother Bob because she has been living with it for 30 years. However, she has a willing buyer who would be willing to walk away over this issue 

4. If Susan agrees to address the issue, why might Bob worry that she won’t address it as carefully as he would? If he has this concern, what alternative can he suggest to resolve the issue? (Hint: With this alternative, he would be the one deciding the specifics of what to do.)  
- Bob might be concerned that she won’t address the issue thoroughly and might just try to cover it up because:  
  * 1\) she has incentive to hide the flaw as the seller with the least amount of cost  
  * 2\) she suggested trying to cover it up by scrubbing it out  
- Bob might want to seek an alternative where he hires someone to resolve the problem by treating the mold and installing the pump, and he has Susan compensate him for conducting this

- Bob may want a top notch solution because of his health problems. Susan will want to just do a good-enough treatment that most other buyers would be happy about  
  * Bob should then propose to get the cost of the good-enough treatment in a discount of the purchase price and then do the top-notch treatment himself  
    * **Should the seller complete the task or should the purchase price be adjusted?:**  
      * **Adjust the price where the buyer has a unique thing that this buyer wants and others would want a generic response (but the generic response is not good enough for the buyer). Then after the purchase price is lowered by the amount of the generic treatment, buyer will complete the unique treatment at his cost**


4. The same facts as in problem 2\. The house has a pool--a nice feature for a weekend house. Bob wants the pool to be attractive. Resurfacing the pool costs approximately $10,000.  
     
   Bob also wants to be sure that the pool’s systems are in working order. For example, the heater should work, the drainage pipes should not be clogged or leak, and the motorized filter, which cleans the pool, should also work. Repairing all of these systems would cost approximately $15,000.  
     
   In addition, the pool needs all the necessary safety features. For example, the pool needs to have a fence, so no one accidentally falls in and so no uninvited guests use the pool and are injured. Indeed, to get home owners insurance, Bob needs to show the insurance company that there is a fence. It costs $2,000 to install a fence.  
     
   The pool also should have two drains, instead of one, in order to reduce the suction from each drain. Otherwise, the suction might be strong enough to pull swimmers down to the drain, causing them to drown. Installing a second drain costs $8,000.  
     
   Bob is doing his due diligence in late January. The pool has been covered for the winter, and there is snow on the ground, so Bob is limited in the due diligence he can do. For example, although he can have the cover removed, the pool systems are not designed to work in freezing temperatures. Turning the systems on when the temperature is less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit--as almost certainly will be the case in late January--can cause the systems to break. Bob is willing to delay the closing until the weather is warmer, but Susan wants the closing to take place no later than March 1\.  
     
1. Which issues can Bob explore before March 1? Which ones cannot be investigated before March 1?  
- Can explore:  
  * Attractiveness  
  * Safety features (fence)  
  * Amount of drains  
- Cannot explore:  
  * Working order of systems

2. If Susan insists on closing before March 1, what should Bob suggest as a way to address his concerns about the pool and, specifically, about issues that cannot be investigated before March 1?  
- Bob could just push the closing until the spring when he can check the working order of the systems (this is the lowest cost to both parties in this specific transaction)  
  * **By having the flexibility of time that Susan doesn’t have, Bob has additional leverage. He can just wait. Burden is on Susan to solve the problem**

- If Susan insists on closing now, then Bob is going to require that Susan bear the cost of the systems not working. Bob could agree to do the deal now and have it lowered by $15K, basically assuming that the systems are not working

- He could get Susan to provide a representation guaranteeing the pool systems are in good working order that survives closing and ensures that she will be responsible for any costs associated with repairment if they are not  
  * **$15K is put in escrow and if the system works, all of that money is released to Susan. If the repairs will cost $10K, Bob gets $10K, etc.**  
  * **This is better for Bob than disputing the charge later on and chasing her down**

- **Bob’s Options:**  
  * **1\) Just wait (knowing she cannot)**  
  * **2\) Knock down the price because I cannot test this (and you are the one rushing this so I will assume that the systems do not work)**  
  * **3\) Contingent purchase price ($15K less and if it works I get the money back) and Escrow account**  
    * **And if Susan says I don’t want to do escrow, Bob can go back and say let’s wait (this is a solution he can keep coming back to)**

3. Susan is willing to assure Bob that the pool systems work and are safe. “But if you want the pool to look different, that’s your responsibility,” she says. “You can make any changes you want to the appearance of the pool once you buy the house, but that expense is your responsibility.” Does this distinction seem reasonable? If so, how can Bob and Susan operationalize it?  
- Yes. **Every buyer wants the pool system to work. Not every buyer will have the same aesthetic preferences for how the pool looks**

- Include that language in the purchase agreement: “Buyer is responsible for all aesthetic changes” and Make sure that “escrow account is just used for repairs and not aesthetic changes”

4. If Susan and Bob proceed with the idea in “c,” can you predict any scenarios in which they disagree about whether an expense is addressing safety or aesthetic issues?  What language would you suggest to deal with this?  
- **On one hand, they may both agree to this in principle before the fact**  
  * **But Susan has incentive to say that all changes are aesthetic**  
  * **Bob has incentive to say that all changes are repairs/functionality**  
    * **They will disagree on how to classify expenses**  
    * **Lawyers must anticipate these pressure points and see where something might be unclear**

- Filtration systems can be behind the walls of the pool. What if that this system is not working, then you have to break and fix the walls?  
  * Seller: The wall of the pool was fixed and we replaced it with pure cement  
  * Buyer: The wall of the pool was fixed and we put tiles with diamonds in them  
  * **In fixing what is functional, you impact the aesthetic**  
    * **Solution: Not simply aesthetic is paid by buyer and functional is paid by seller. Instead, add “Any cost of aesthetic repairs necessary to restore the appearance of the pool to where it was aesthetically before the repair is the responsibility of the seller.”**


5. Same facts as above. In asking $1.1 million for the house, Susan has offered to include outdoor furniture, art, exercise equipment, beds, a dining room table, and other personal property. This personal property was worth approximately $50,000. Since this is a second home for Bob, he liked the idea of buying this personal property as well. When they settled on a price of $1,030,000 (as noted above), this included the personal property.   
     
   Before signing a contract, Bob reaches out to you. As a real estate lawyer, you know that New York (where Pretty County is located) has a “mansion” tax. Under this tax, a buyer pays 1% of the value of any home with a purchase price of $1 million or more. This tax does not apply to a home with a purchase price of less than $1 million.  
- **Cliff Effect:** If the purchase price is under the edge of $1M, tax is $0 ($999,999 \= $0 tax)  
  * If the purchase price is over the edge of $1M, tax is 10% ($1,000,000 \= $10,000 tax)


  New York also charges an 8 percent sales tax on sales of personal property. While this obviously applies to purchases in a store, it also applies at garage sales and in other circumstances when one individual buys personal property from another, as long as the total price of all the property is more than a minimum amount (which you should assume here is $500).


  The town where the house is located also has an annual property tax of 3% of a house’s appraised value. The town’s last appraisal three years ago valued Susan’s house at $800,000, so she has been paying property taxes of $24,000 per year. The town is likely to use Bob’s purchase price as the valuation for his property taxes.


1. Susan’s lawyer sends over a contract, which includes the following language: “The parties hereto acknowledge that there is no consideration attributable to the personal property included hereunder.” In light of this language, what taxes will Bob owe? Which will he avoid?  
- Owes:  
  * Mansion tax (1 percent) because $1.03M purchase price \= $10,300  
  * Property tax (3 percent of $1.03M) because of the new valuation \= $30,900  
- Avoids:  
  * Sales tax (8 percent) because the personal property is included in the purchase price of the home \= would have been $4K

2. What suggestion can you make that will reduce Bob’s tax bill in the coming years? Please note that Bob will still have to pay Susan a total of $1.03 million--that’s not negotiable--and that Bob is very conservative about tax planning. He will only do something that is clearly legal.  
- Bob should pay for the personal property separately than including it in the purchase price of the house  
  * This will increase his sales tax bill currently to $4,000, but it will avoid the mansion tax of $10,300 entirely and lower his property taxes for coming years by decreasing the valuation of the home at the time of sale to $980K (making the taxes in the following years $29,400 instead of $30,900)

- **Allocate the purchase price in different ways can help you avoid certain taxes**

- If mansion tax was gone, **are you better off allocating the price to the personal property or the real property**?  
  * **The answer has to do with how long you plan to hold the house**:  
    * The rate on the **sales tax is higher but it is only paid once**  
      * If living in the house for short time 🡪 Minimize the personal property value 🡪 Lowers total tax by lowering one-time higher sales tax  
    * The rate on the **property tax is lower but is paid multiple times**  
      * If living in the house for long time 🡪 Maximize the real property value 🡪 Lowers total tax by lowering repeat lower property tax

- OH:  
  * Home buyers are usually going to want to allocate personal property to the purchase price so they don’t pay sales tax on that as long as doing so would not put them over the amount of paying some other tax like the mansion tax. Real property contracts allocate $0 to personalty but make specific requests for what needs to stay in the purchase agreement. Isn’t this a way that the government tax collector could police how much to allocate to personal property?  
    * Yes. But the valuation you show the government has to be plausible (although you might be able to say that the seller just left the stuff for you)  
    * But also remember the other tax (mansion maybe) of property tax  
      * Here, it depends on if the one-time upfront higher sales tax is better than allocating that money to purchase price and paying more in the recurring lower property tax several times  
      * You will know the answer to this by thinking about both the percentages of each tax and the number of years you live in the house (the number of times the recurring property tax is paid)

3. Before the closing, there is some damage to the house in a storm. Susan knows that the damage is her responsibility but she has moved away and is not in a position to supervise the repairs herself. She also realizes that Bob will want the opportunity to “do it his way.” She offers to give Bob a $2,000 credit. “The purchase price will be the same,” she says, “but we’ll treat the amount you will pay your contractors as part of the purchase price.” Bob mentions this to you and you say, “we should do it differently as a way to reduce your taxes.” What is the better alternative?  
- Bob should get Susan to knock $2,000 off of the purchase price  
  * This lowers the mansion tax and property taxes in subsequent years by lowering the valuation at the time of sale


6. The same facts as in above. Susan’s lawyer sends over the attached draft, which (among other things) is supposed to address the following issues. How does the draft treat these issues. What changes (if any) would you suggest for each?  
   1. Ira’s inspection yields a list of minor repairs that are needed for the house to be in working order. Susan commits to do them before the closing, and Bob wants her to use a licensed contractor for these repairs (i.e., and not to do them herself or to ask someone who is not an expert to do them). Bob wonders how he can confirm that all the work was done, especially since some of it involves electrical work inside the walls of the house. What does the draft provide? What change, if any, would you suggest? (Hint: Focus on two clauses in the rider.)  
- Rider 4: “The Seller represents that the appliances and systems are in working order and will be in working order at closing.”  
- Rider 5: “Prior to the closing of title, the Seller will complete the work on the punch list attached to this Agreement as Appendix B at the Seller’s sole cost and expense.”

- Bob might want to add that all work must be completed by a licensed contractor that he approves of AND that he maintains a warranty that the work continues to operate normally 6 months after closing  
  * He can also add a clause that allows him to inspect the work after it is complete  
    * Need to add inspection contingency into form contract **(align form contract with rider)**

  2. Susan built a guest apartment over the garage and applied for a permit from the town, which would allow her (and any subsequent owner) to rent out the apartment to tenants. Bob wants to make sure that the town has, in fact, issued a permit (or a so-called “certificate of occupancy”) for the apartment. What does the draft provide? What change, if any, would you suggest? (Hint: Focus on the rider.)  
- Rider 1: “At the time of closing, the final Certificates of Occupancy shall have been issued for all work performed at the premises **for which building permits have been issued**.”  
  * Problem: “I have a permit when I have a permit.” But what we want to know is: do we have a permit when I need a permit?  
    * **Watch for things that sound like things that sound like but don’t mean what they are supposed to say**  
- Bob might want to take out the building permits part and get a representation that says that “All work performed at the premises maintains a certificate of occupancy which survives closing”  
  * “I have permits for all improvements and changes for which a permit has been required including the shed.”

  3. Bob is borrowing money to buy the house. He wants to be excused from the contract if after reasonable efforts he is unable to secure a mortgage. What does the draft provide? What change, if any, would you suggest? (Hint: Focus on the main contract.)  
- The draft does not provide for a mortgage contingency, but Bob will want to get one to ensure that if he does not get financing he can get his downpayment back  
- **Downpayment: Allows seller to keep downpayment without lawsuit (form of liquidated damages)**  
  * Does not apply with mortgage contingency. Without funding after best efforts, you get downpayment back  
  * Cash buyers do not need mortgage contingencies. So their downpayment is firm  
    * In exchange, cash buyer will want a lower the price

  4. Bob’s lawyer does a “title search,” in which a company searches public records to confirm that Susan actually is the owner of the property and that the town’s building department has not found any building code violations. The search reveals that Susan does not have a permit for the shed next to the house. In light of the above violation, Bob still wants to buy the house, but he wants Susan to get this permit before closing. What remedy does the draft provide? What change, if any, would you suggest? (Hint: Focus on the main contract’s Sections 6 and 10a.)  
- Section 6: The draft provides for a termination clause if the buyer’s searches do not contain “reasonably satisfactory title”  
- Bob will want to keep the provision that allows the Seller to perfect title but in case she cannot, Bob’s remedy should be a re-negotiation of the purchase price subject to the additional liability  
  * **The remedy the client wants needs to be in the section**

  5. Bob wants to do a “walk through” the day before the closing to make sure all the work that Susan promised to do has, in fact, been done and that there are no new problems with the house. If he finds any issues, he wants to delay the closing until Susan has addressed them. What does the draft provide? What change, if any, would you suggest? (Hint: Focus on the main contract’s Sections 7 and 15).  
- Section 7: The draft does not allow for an inspection contingency  
- Section 15: Daily penalty for delayed closing  
  * **Daily amount for delayed damages is good, but he needs to make it clearer that the seller in this case must pay the damages for a delay if she does not deliver something by closing**  
  * “Delays are the responsibility of the seller if seller has not done \_\_\_\_.”  
- Bob will want to add an inspection contingency and carve out an exception to the delayed closing penalty in case he finds something the day of that he justifiably believes needs to be remedied where the seller is responsible for delay damages

# 4: M\&A (DD solving asymmetric information)

- **Why acquire a business?**  
  * **Can’t do everything with a small business, many contracts because there are information/incentive problems that contracting doesn’t solve but owning a business might solve these**  
    * **Hard to specify in a K what the business wants in detail. And then we don’t know if the K has properly been honored**  
    * **Owning not only enforces quality but also enforces proprietary nature of the work**  
- **Alternatives to K:**  
  * **Repeat Relationship and Reputation: Evolving understanding between the parties can work**  
  * **Instead Make instead of Buy: Have employees instead of independent vendors with K’s**  
- **If you want to buy (do it yourself), acquisition is solution to information/incentive problems of contracting, but it is in itself a host to information/incentive problems**  
  * The fact that the seller is willing to sell should create skepticism because they know more than you  
  * **Due diligence: Key mechanism to address information problems so you can continue to do deals**  
    * **DD differs from stock to asset deals**

  

- DD in M\&A  
  * It is a cooperative process 🡪 Gilson  
    * Good news increases the price so seller shares  
    * Bad news can be in seller’s interest to share so that buyer does not assume the worst if seller is visibly hiding something which would lower price (or buyer walk away)  
    * Mutual interests pursued  
  * It is a contentious process 🡪 Critique Gilson  
    * If there are ways seller can avoid sharing bad news without seeming like they are hiding something (using a neutral reason to avoid sharing information), then that is best for seller  
      * This creates a challenge for the buyer. Then buyer will need to evaluate if seller is trying to make an excuse or is seller is actually cautious about sharing that information for a good reason  
    * Buyer then makes counter-proposal that would be appealing if seller is being honest about motivations for sharing information, but not appealing if seller is concealing for bad reason  
      * Third party to look at files: If seller says no, still could be that they are hyper-cautious but more likely that they are hiding something  
  * Seller should pay to get the information  
    * Adjust purchase price to cover it  
      * This is unusual in reality unless it is a major item  
    * If seller is trying to hide something about the litigation, they will allow buyer to look at their mounds of files which buyer will not be able to do  
- Reputation for being honest and forthcoming is important because you will be a repeat player, but these strategies might be used by others so need to be aware of them

1\. 	Steve runs a company called Orange, which makes computers, phones, and other consumer electronics products. Steve’s goal is to distinguish the company by offering unique features and reliable, high-quality products. He wants to make sure the company’s products look, feel, and really are different. In addition to the hardware, he believes they need to have an operating system and other software that are different from what other companies use.

1. You are Steve’s lawyer. He is considering forming a contract with a software developer, asking them to develop an innovative operating system. He asks you to draft a contract. You ask him to define what he’s looking for and he says, “It has to be unique and innovative.” You ask him to be more specific, and he says, “It has to be really good, creative, and different.”’ What advice do you give him? Is a contract going to be effective in policing the quality standards Steve has in mind?

- Steve needs to add specificity to the contract to ensure that there are explicit obligations that can be carried out and he can have recourse for them if they are not  
- **Limits on K’s: In order to depend on a K, you need to be able to be specific about what performance requires**  
  * Need businesspeople to create more specificity that can be incorporated into a K  
  * Steve might resist because he is a creative genius. He doesn’t reduce his vision to specific words

2. Aside from a contract, do software developers have other (not legally- enforceable) reasons to want to impress Steve?  
- Yes, the developers’ future relationship relies on Steve to think they are doing a good job  
- **Contract is very important, but it plays only a partial role in ensuring that commercial actors fulfill each other’s expectations**  
  * **Repeat Players**: Powerful role in markets  
    * You don’t need to fully specify quality if you are in repeat relationship because if the vendor disappoints, they will not be offered work with the buyer in the future  
  * **Reputation**: The reputation of the vendor to other sellers will guarantee them future business

3. If Steve can’t rely on a contract or on non-legal reasons to ensure that the software is innovative and high quality, what else can Steve do?  Do you see a reason why the business of making software might be paired with another business, so that the same owners own both?  
- **Make or Buy Decision: In principle, you could rely on K’s/reputation/repeat relationships with other businesses for all of the things you need, but you can also do everything yourself**  
  * **You can be a small company and you outsource everything (BUY)**  
    * **Other companies’ employees do the functions**  
  * **You can be a big company and do everything yourself (MAKE)**  
    * **Your employees do the functions**

- **What types of factors determine the make or buy decision?**  
  * **If what the business needs is easy to specify with detail in a K 🡪 Strengthens the case to buy, rely on outsiders**  
  * **Where repeat relationships and K is not enough 🡪 Strengthens the case to make yourself**  
    * **The decision to make or buy often involves addressing asymmetric information and incentive problems**  
  * In a world where there is perfect information (no information/incentive problems), then you would not have big companies because everyone would transact with through K’s

4. What is “vertical integration”?  What economic problems is it designed to solve? Have you heard the phrase “make or buy decision”?

- **MAKE: Vertical Integration \= A business strategy for a company to own multiple stages of production/supply chain**  
  * **Vertical Integration solves the problem of diverging incentives and aligns them by creating the same goals/track for different companies**  
  * **Not necessarily serving more customers (like horizontal) but when we serve customers, we are doing it all ourselves**

- **Horizontal integration \= We have one stage of production and buy another business that is in the same stage of production (bigger market share in the niche we are in)**

- **Why do people do M\&A? To solve information and incentive problems**  
  * **But when they do it, they create other information and incentive problems**

2\.     Assume that Jim runs a law firm. He has 40 associates, but he has more work than they can do.  Carla approaches Jim with the following idea: she runs an agency that can provide Jim with lawyers who take “freelance” assignments, which means they will come work temporarily for Jim (e.g., for a day or a few hours) to help with a specific assignment.  They can help Jim draft a specific contract or motion or a will.  Once they are done, they no longer work for Jim.

1. What might Jim like about this idea?

- He can complete additional work and make more revenue without extensive fees  
  * Flexibility tailored to his exact needs, reducing overhead costs  
  * Buy strategy

2. Why will Jim hesitate to make by contracting for labor instead of buy company?  
- **Information problem: Jim depends on people he didn’t vet or hire. He doesn’t know how good they will be at the job**  
- **Incentive Problem: The lack of long-term employment or commitment gives the employees less incentive to do good work**  
  * **Jim loses the repeat relationship with the individuals**

3. What else might Jim do if he has too much work?  What are the benefits and costs of this alternative, compared with the idea described above?

- If Jim hires more attorneys this may cost him more but these employees are more deeply tied to Jim and have incentive to do better work  
  * Make strategy

3\.     What is “due diligence”?  What problem is it supposed to solve? (Hint: It’s a fundamental theme of this course.) How does a buyer know that a seller is telling the truth when the seller provides information?

\-	Due diligence solves information asymmetry

\-	A buyer needs to verify the information a seller is giving him

4\.     Due diligence—and, more fundamentally, the information a buyer wants—can vary with the deal structure. Assume that a company called “Buyer” wants to acquire a business called “Seller” for cash. Buyer can either buy the assets of Seller (an “asset deal”) or Buyer can by the stock of Seller (a “stock deal”).

1. As a logistical matter, what is the difference between an asset and a stock deal? What, specifically, is Buyer buying in each case?

- Asset Deal \= Buyer transacts with the corporation that owns the assets; Purchasing physical components of the company; Seller remains the legal owner of the company  
- Stock Deal \= Buyer transacts with the shareholders who own the corporation; Purchasing the value of the company through equity from shareholders; Buyer becomes the legal owner of the company

2. Assume Seller did not properly file a patent.  Does Buyer need to worry about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock deal?

- Asset Deal \= Worried about this because the buyer is buying the patent as an asset  
- Stock Deal \= Worried about this because the value of the company can decrease, and buyer will be on the hook

- **The quality of the assets that come over to you matter in both the Asset and Stock deal**  
  * **In asset deal you buy the asset directly; In stock deal you are buying the corporate shell that holds the assets (so you will own it indirectly)**  
  * Quality of assets is relevant to both kinds of deals and DD must focus on quality of assets for both kinds of deals

3. Assume Seller has a cheap lease, but if Seller is no longer the counterparty on the lease, it expires. Does Buyer need to worry about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock deal?  
- Asset Deal \= Worried because seller will remain the counterparty as legal owner so to switch the lease counterparty you need to re-negotiate  
  * **The company the buyer did not buy is still the counterparty on these leases (likely you will have to re-negotiate. You don’t inherit the leases)**

- **Stock Deal \= Not worried because nothing is changing about the lease. The lease is still between seller and corporation. It is just that corporation has a new owner**  
  * **Lease is legally still in place**  
    * Sometimes a lease will have a change in control provision with a new ownership control where landlord requires re-negotiation for any change of control. This makes the stock deal and asset deal equivalent  
  * Stock deal is better here because you will keep the below market lease

4. Assume Seller has not paid its taxes for three years.  Does Buyer need to worry about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock deal?  
- Asset Deal \= Not worried about this  
  * Buyer will not take on Seller’s tax liabilities  
- Stock Deal \= Worried about this because seller’s liability can impact buyer’s current company

- **Key Reason people prefer Asset deals instead of stock:**  
  * **Asset deal \= Buyer gets assets of company without liabilities of company**  
    * **Easier to DD than a stock deal**  
  * **Stock deal \= Buyer gets assets of company with liabilities of company**  
    * **More DD required**

- One wrinkle: Tax liens give government interest in the buyer’s property after transfer. When assets are sold, government collects beforehand

- What if buyer has not paid its taxes for three years? Does seller need to worry about this in an asset deal? In a stock deal?  
  * **The legal situation of the buyer does not matter to the seller as long as the buyer pays**  
    * **DD is mostly the buyer understanding the seller and problems the seller presents**  
  * **BUT in a stock deal the seller cares about the buyer’s liabilities**  
    * **In a stock for stock deal, both parties conduct DD as if they are the buyer**  
      * **Actual buyer buying the business**  
      * **Seller is a buyer needing to understand the value of the stock they are purchasing in the new company**

5. Assume that one of Seller’s employees made inappropriate jokes in the workplace, and Seller just terminated his employment.  Does Buyer need to worry about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock deal?  
- Asset Deal \= Not worried about this  
- Stock Deal \= Worried about this because seller’s liability can impact buyer’s current company

- **If you buy the assets, the liabilities do not come with the assets in asset deal**  
  * **Past liabilities are not an issue in asset deal but future liabilities are**  
    * **Liabilities that arise after you bought the business are yours**  
    * So if the victim employee is continuing with the company and then decides to bring litigation after purchase, that would be an issue in an asset deal as well as stock deal

6. Assume Buyer is buying a drug patent from Seller.  There is uncertainty about whether the drug will work, so Buyer is paying a first installment now, and will pay another amount in two years.  The amount of this payment will depend on whether the drug works.  Assume also that Buyer has not paid its taxes for three years.  Does Seller need to worry about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock deal?

- **Since seller is not getting paid all at once, seller must do DD on buyer to make sure that buyer will have the ability to pay at the time the money is owed**  
  * **If seller is getting paid all at once, seller does not need to do a lot of DD on buyer. This changes with staged payment arrangement**  
  * **This is the case in both stock and asset deals** 

5\.  Seller is negotiating to sell a theme park to Buyer. It used to be very popular, but lately it has not been drawing the same crowds. Seller has built a new ride, based on a popular videogame, which will be the subject of a movie that will be released after the sale closes. Seller has produced the game for many years and also is producing the movie. The ride won’t open until after the movie opens—and, therefore, until after the sale.

A.  Buyer asks for information about the game, including the number of users over the past several years. Why do you think Buyer wants this information? Do you think Seller should provide it?

- Buyer wants this information because it will inform the buyer of the potential popularity of the ride and inform the price of the theme park  
- **Seller should provide this information to help buyer find a proper valuation for the ride and hopefully its popularity will convince buyer to pay more. Also, if seller hides this information or gives misleading answers, buyer will interpret that as the information is unfavorable to seller**  
  * Refusal to answer, ambiguous answers, misleading answers are not workable strategies for seller  
  * Seller’s information will make buyer more confident in paying a larger price for the theme park  
- Flat out lying in writing is not a successful strategy for seller because they become liable. But a more common strategy is to give a non-answer or exaggeration (which in turn is interpreted poorly by buyer)

B. Ron Gilson has argued that due diligence should be a cooperative process, since the parties have shared interests. Does the example in “A” support his view?

- Yes. Both buyer and seller have interest in sharing information because this builds the trust with the buyer that helps the seller get a better price

C. Buyer asks for information about the movie (which, again, has not been released), including information about the reaction of focus groups who have seen it. Why do you think Buyer wants this information? Why might Seller be more concerned about addressing Buyer’s questions about the movie? (Hint: is there a difference between offering facts, on the one hand, and predictions, on the other?)

- Offering predications are less reliable than offering facts  
  * If focus groups love the movie, seller will share information. Get buyer to pay more  
  * If focus groups hate the movie, seller will not want to share  
  * If focus groups are mixed, seller will want to share to build trust with the buyer to quell the buyer’s bad feeling about not having information (buyer will assume that the reaction from the focus group was awful) despite the fact that it was mixed and does not add to the case that it proactively helps  
- **There is reason for the seller to share fairly bad information because by not sharing it, buyer will think it is worse**

D.  Does “C” support or undercut Gilson’s claim that due diligence should be a cooperative process?

- **Gilson: Seller has an interest in buyer not assuming the worst about a situation. With good news, there is a shared interest in seller providing information. With bad news, there is still a shared interest in seller providing information because seller prevents buyer from assuming the worst**

- Gilson critique: If there is unknown information then seller bears the cost if it provides the rep. because seller doesn’t know what the outcome would be, and they could be liable in the future for providing that rep.  
  * At the same time, the seller bears the cost if they don’t provide that rep. because, like Gilson says, the buyer will walk or think the worst of the situation which is that something is wrong by them not providing it  
  * So, either way the seller bears the cost with unknown information  
    * Chess moves – think ahead of what the other party will say when you ask for the rep. and how can you contradict that

6\. Carol is an entrepreneur who is developing a cure for the common cold.  She would like to sell her company, Seller, to Buyer, a pharmaceutical company.  Doug, who works for Buyer, wants to see the clinical trials for the new drug.  Carol knows that the results are mixed.  They suggest that the drug does cure colds, but they also suggest that the drug may have some serious side-effects. 

1. Without any legal constraints, what would Carol (or, indeed, an unethical version of Carol) want to say about the trials? Does she have an incentive to share good news? What about bad news?

- Carol would want to say that the drug cures colds and accomplishes its goal without sharing the news about negative side-effects  
  * She has incentive to share good news without bad news

2. Can Carol simply share the good news (“the drug cures colds”) but lie about or omit the bad news (serious side-effects)?

- No. Carol must show the results of the clinical trials which will yield both the good and bad

3. Does Carol face any legal liability if she simply refuses to share any information about the trials? If Carol refuses, what will Doug assume about the trials?

- Carol does not face legal liability if she just does not share information about the trials at all  
- In this case, Doug will assume the trials show bad results

- **You are liable for what you say but not for what you refuse to say**  
  * **But then Buyer will assume that the lack of information is the worst scenario (cost will be the better price)**

4. Given your answer to C, do sellers have an incentive to share bad news, as well as good news?

- **Sellers have incentive to share bad news as well as good news to show buyers that they are not hiding anything. More information is better**

5. In principle, would your answer to “D” change if a seller is able to offer a justification for not to share information, which has nothing to do with the fact that this information might not be flattering?

- Yes. If the seller can justify why to not give the bad information, then the buyer will be less skeptical of the information omission

6. Building on “E,” can you think of a reason why Carol might regret sharing clinical trials with Buyer (even if the trials are glowingly positive) if the deal does not go through?  (Hint: Assume that Carol’s company and Buyer are competitors and that the trials contain valuable information.) If so, does this offer Carol a strategy for refusing to disclose the information?

- Carol might claim that the trials give Buyer a competitive advantage by seeing material non-public information  
  * **This is a strategy for Carol to justify non-disclosure**

7. If Carol has more than one reason not to disclose the trials, can Buyer tell what the real reason is?  What, if anything, can Buyer do in response?

- Buyer cannot tell what the real reason is  
- **Gilson critique: Seller does not have incentive to share bad information all the time when she can mask the reason for not sharing it justifiably**

- **Buyer could institute a confidentiality agreement or non-compete. Here, this agreement would allow Buyer to see trials but not produce the drug based on research Buyer does**  
  * **If Seller disagreed to confidentiality agreement, Buyer will be more inclined to believe that seller is actually concerned about the bad news**  
    * Buyer could have the results with MNPI redacted or investigate by a third party (expert can be picked by seller from a list provided by buyer and they can only tell high level about what the results are)  
      * If Seller says no to this, then she is probably covering bad news

- **When there are 2 reasons for buyer to be skeptical (one is a real worry of the seller and the other is something she is trying to hide), Buyer should make proposals which reveal if the stated objection is still plausible. And if they refuse these proposals protecting the real worry, then seller has answered you indirectly that the problem is with the thing they are trying to hide**

7\.  Gilson says parties have the incentive to be truthful in due diligence?  Do you agree?

- **Not all the time. They have an incentive to seem truthful. Seller does not always have the incentive to give the information if they can seem truthful without providing information**

- NOTE on Good Faith: You cannot lie but you can non-answer questions  
  * For the most part under U.S. law you can decide not to share certain information (but some jurisdictions require good faith in dealings which you can be liable for hiding something). From your silence, other party can draw their answers

- **Gilson says that it is in the Seller’s interest to share unflattering information so that Buyer doesn’t think it is worse**  
  * **Schizer Criticism of Gilson on Seller’s interest to share information: Can be true but be careful of situations where Seller can give an alternative explanation for why they won’t share. Seller will find an alternative explanation that is plausible to not tell you something without admitting to not telling you something**

8\. Let’s say Buyer wants to know about any litigation pending for Carol’s company.  Carol can ask her lawyers, who know the details of the litigation, to write up a description, but the time they will spend will cost Carol $10,000.  Alternatively, Carol can invite Buyer’s lawyers to come and read the litigation files (which are quite large).  If she does this, Buyer is likely to have to pay their lawyers $50,000.  What should Carol do?

- Carol should charge Buyer $10K to get the information herself and split the surplus in profits with Buyer

- **Gilson says the most efficient, lowest cost provider to get the information should provide the information (Carol here). The surplus of $40K (what it would have cost buyer to the DD more than Seller) should be saved and be factored into the purchase price (so the price should increase by $20K – they cut the buyer in)**

- **Schizer Criticism of Gilson on Who Should Bear the Cost of Producing Information:**  
  * **1\) Institutional Factors Interfere: Deal prices are set by senior officials for big deals who cannot factor in all modest DD costs and do not get factored in after the prices are already set. Instead, just make the other party bear it – price won’t get re-adjusted**

  * **2\) Instead of blatant refusal to share litigation of information, Carol can get away with not sharing it by placing the burden on the Buyer to investigate and pay the cost themselves even if it is more efficient for her to bear the cost of producing information**  
    * **Alternative explanation of something plausible defeats assumption of Buyer of worst case scenario**

10\. Third Party Experts

1. What role do accountants play in acquisitions?

- Figure out financial status of the target

- **Third parties come in and vouch for effects**  
  * **Bridges parties’ mistrust of one another**  
- Don’t want accountant to be biased

2. What about investment bankers? Do you know what a “fairness opinion” is?  
- **Fairness Opinion \= Evaluation of if a price is fair from a buyer’s perspective**  
  * **Schizer: Fairness opinions are not effective (they aren’t for reassurance but for a litigation insurance device). Doesn’t really vouch for the parties’ trust**

3. Do lawyers ever vouch for aspects of a deal?  
- Yes, on legal issues lawyers issue opinions to vouch for parties

4. When these experts are asked to reassure the parties on particular issues, why (if at all) might they be tempted to overstate their case? What (if anything) stops them from doing so?

- Things preventing them from overstating their case might be:  
  * Reputational risk (lose credibility)  
    * **You have a temptation to overstate but this may come at the long-term cost of your work in the future (less people will trust your opinion)**  
  * Regulatory liability

- Law firms have functions attempting to deal with asymmetric information and incentive problems  
  * If each individual partner is allowed to make an opinion, then each partner may be tempted to overstate hoping that her overstatement will be balanced by more cautious colleagues and she will make her clients happy

  10\. Ben Buyer owns a plot of land. He is considering buying a neighboring plot from Sue Seller. Ben wants to combine the two plots and build a skyscraper. He is concerned, though, that he won’t be able to get approval from the zoning board. If Ben can combine the two plots, he’s willing to pay $10 million for Sue’s plot. If he can’t, he’s only willing to pay $7 million. It’s very likely that the zoning board will approve Ben’s request, but the process takes time.

1. Assume that Sue is not in a hurry. What do you think is the cleanest way for the parties to proceed?

- Wait and see approach: Wait to see if Ben gets approval from the zoning board

2. Assume that Sue actually is in a hurry and is flexible on the price. You represent her. What suggestion do you have to help her get the deal done?

- Contingent deal: Price fluctuates depending on zoning decision  
  * Put money in escrow in meantime

  12\. Seller, a start-up company, is developing a new type of bus, which is supposed to be more fuel efficient.  Seller has developed a design, and has made a few of the new buses in order to test them, but has not yet begun delivering buses to customers.  New York City has ordered 10,000 of these buses, but no buses have been delivered yet.  Buyer is a big company that makes buses, and wants the New York City contract. 

  Seller has begun testing the buses, and has discovered a problem with the wheels, which may be expensive to fix.  Seller has not yet finished testing the buses.

  The agreement has the following language: “Buyer has made a lengthy, detailed, and independent investigation regarding the design and specifications of the new bus,” and "Seller has not finished testing the new bus.”  The agreement also says that “Seller shall continue to give Buyer access to inspect the new bus” and that "neither party is relying upon any warranty or representation of the other not fully set forth in this agreement." The agreement does not have any other representations about possible defects in the bus or about the tests Seller has been conducting.

  After the deal closes and Buyer discovers the defect in the new bus, Buyer sues, claiming that Seller should have told Buyer about the defect. 

1. If you are the judge, and you have to decide the case based only on the contract language quoted above, who do you think should win the lawsuit?

- Seller wins argument: Buyer never asked. We had this contractual language. We never lied or misrepresented anything  
- Buyer wins argument: Seller cheated us. They knew their buses were defective and didn’t tell us


2. If you decide that Seller wins, are you rewarding sneakiness?  
- They didn’t ask. We had the language in the contract  
  * You are rewarding sneakiness

3. If you decide that Buyer wins, are you rewarding carelessness?  
- You are rewarding carelessness

4. What language should Buyer have asked for in the agreement in order to avoid this problem?

- **“To the best of the seller’s knowledge, there are no defects in the design or manufacture of the buses”**

- In some jurisdictions, a duty of good faith would be required  
- **But in the U.S., it is a buyer beware approach**

- **Benefits of U.S. approach (seller friendly):**  
  * Low quality is priced into the K  
  * Encourages sellers to sell at discount where they wouldn’t in other approaches  
  * Court is not there to re-negotiate the deal for a party  
  * We don’t really know what the terms were. It could be that when you said you were not asking for representations, the seller gave you a cheaper price. We shouldn’t intervene  
  * Better for parties to negotiate for themselves and have people trust the language of the K’s because this creates predictability for parties doing future deals to similarly trust the language of the K and do a deal  
- **Benefits of other approaches (buyer friendly):**  
  * Economizes DD (don’t need to expend the resources and ask/research every question)  
  * Built in duty of good faith

# 5: M\&A (Covenants and Conditions)

- MAC Clause is a way for buyers to get out of a transactions even after they have signed and said they are going to go through with the deal  
- Other clauses can be used to get out of a transaction:  
  * Representations (true as of signing date), Covenants (what happens between signing and closing date), Conditions  
    * Not ordinary course of business – This is a covenant relevant in buyers re-negotiating deals signed pre-pandemic even without using the MAC Clause  
    * Debt covenants not fulfilled – This is a covenant relevant in buyers re-negotiating deals signed pre-pandemic even without using the MAC Clause  
- 2 Reasons to Include a MAC Clause (to let a buyer out of a signed deal):  
  * 1\) Symmetry: Sellers want to drum up more interest with buyers by giving them something to be willing to get into an auction  
    * Evens the playing field between buyer (back-out protection) and seller (shareholder approval vote) if market changes and the deal becomes better for one party after signing  
      * This only is an advantage once you have the deal but is an obstacle for getting the deal you want  
      * Buyer will not bid on fringe deals because seller can back out. Buyer is at disadvantage  
      * Sellers then have fewer buyers in the market to bid against each other and push the price up  
      * Irony: Seller doesn’t want corporate law’s unilateral advantage. I want to offset it by giving Buyer a similar ability to walk away  
  * 2\) Investment: Motivates seller management to maintain state of the business between signing and closing  
    * More about moral hazard, agency problem between signing and closing  
    * Buyer depends on seller to take care of the company between signing and closing, but selling management is not motivated to do that because they are going to lose their jobs  
    * MAC Clause allows buyer to walk if there are company-specific problems  
    * Incentivizes selling management to do as well as peer companies  
      * 3 Parts to MAC Clause:  
        * 1\) If bad thing happens, buyer can cancel  
        * 2\) If bad thing impacts whole industry generally, buyer cannot cancel  
        * 3\) If bad thing impacts whole industry but has a disproportionate impact on you, buyer can cancel  
          * Company specific problems allow buyer to walk which motivates selling management  
- Why have these clauses?  
  * Symmetry rationale \= Common situation for things to change between signing and closing  
    * Buyer/Seller can get better deal if market moves  
  * Investment rationale  
- Seller also has protection of BoD (can back out after signing)  
  * Shareholders need to approve transaction through vote  
  * Buyer shareholders do not have that ability to cancel the deal if the market moves against them  
    * There is a difference

1. Acquisition agreements contain representations, covenants, and conditions? What is the difference?  
- **Representations \= Statement of fact in signing/purchase agreement (past or current state)**  
  * This fact is true as of the signing  
  * Can change over time without giving rise to breach  
  * Then in a closing agreement, you get a Tru-Up Statement (stating that everything you said since signing is still true)  
- **Covenants \= Party’s promise to perform/not perform an action (after signing, before closing future promise)**  
  * Build in governance over the course of the transaction  
  * Many covenants (and some representations) end at closing but some survive  
- **Conditions (Warranties) \= Term where something must happen/not happen or else the deal is not going to close (future promise)**  
  * A super-covenant

- Signing \= Contract is made  
- Closing \= Fruition of the contract. When transfer of the business takes place  
  * Can be days-months after signing

2. Is the following language a representation, a covenant, or a condition? 

   1. “Target and the Shareholder jointly and severally represent, warrant and agree as follows: Target is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with the power to own its property, to carry on its business as now being conducted, and to enter into and carry out the terms of this Agreement.”  
- Representation

  2. “Each balance sheet delivered to Acquiring pursuant to this Agreement shall reflect all claims, debts or liabilities of Target which should be reflected thereon in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.“  
- Covenant  
  * A condition would say that if this didn’t happen then the deal is off  
  * This is a promise from a party between signing and closing  
  * “Shall reflect” is covenant language

  3. “During the period from the date hereof to and including the Closing, Target will conduct its business solely in the usual and ordinary manner and will refrain from any transaction not in the ordinary course of business or except as otherwise permitted herein unless the prior written consent of Acquiring to such transaction has been obtained.”  
- Covenant  
  * Between signing and closing

  4. “No action or proceeding before a court or any other governmental agency or body shall have been instituted or threatened to restrain or prohibit the Merger contemplated hereby.”

- Condition  
  * We will buy you unless authorities tell us we can’t. If they tell us we can’t, the deal is off

3. You represent the buyer of a company.  You send over the following representation: “Target is not subject to any material liability by reason of a violation of any order, rule, or regulation of any Federal, state, municipal or other governmental agency.”  In response, the seller changes the language.  Find the change.  What do you learn from the change they made in the language, and what follow up questions do you want to ask? 

   5. “Target is not subject to any material liability by reason of a criminal violation of any order, rule, or regulation of any Federal, state, municipal or other governmental agency.”

- Added “Criminal violation”  
- If seller cannot give a representation about all violations, they are probably hiding a non-criminal violation

- If you are given the opportunity to do the first draft of the agreement, take it so that you can shape it in a way favorable to you  
- Always pay close attention to what is changed because there is information in that and it will show you what to follow up about  
  * You want to ask for a comprehensive list of any civil violations they are subject to

  6. “Target is not subject to any material liability by reason of a violation of any order, rule, or regulation of any national governmental agency.”

- Change to “National governmental agency”  
- If seller can only give a representation about national governmental agency violations, they are probably hiding state/municipal agency violations  
  * I would ask if they are subject to any violations from state/municipal agencies

- **The changes are potential sources of information**  
- **You want a balanced question:**  
  * **You want a broad enough question to learn information**  
  * **You don’t want the question to be overly broad or else you will annoy them and give more opportunity to skirt the narrowing information you want to know** 

4. Materiality & Knowledge Qualifiers

1. You represent the seller. Your client is asked to make the following representation: “Target has paid all taxes and assessments (including interest or penalties) owed by it to the extent that such taxes and assessments are due.”  Why might you want to add the word “material,” so that the rep reads “Target has paid all material taxes . . . .”

- 3 Reasons to Add “Material”:  
  * 1\) Avoid tedious and costly task of gathering all taxes and assessments or conceal potentially bad information about non-material taxes and assessments  
  * 2\) Do not furnish purchaser with an out over a minor misrepresentation, in the event that purchaser turns luke-warm on the deal and needs an excuse to call it off  
  * 3\) Guard against purchaser going after his client for indemnification down the road

- **Seller wants to add “material” because they do not want to be on the hook for small fees and it will take a lot of work/resources to track down every last penny. But if it is important, we paid it**  
- **Should buyer agree to materiality clause?**  
  * **You would always rather not have it and know more but you need to be reasonable**

2. Let’s say we define “material” as an issue involving at least $500.  Do you see a problem with defining materiality in this way?  Hint: does it matter how many nonmaterial facts are left out?  How can we deal with this problem?  
- **Problem with defining material as involving at least $500 is that, in the aggregate, nonmaterial taxes and assessments can add up to a lot**  
- **We can deal with this by putting a cap on the non-material total costs or amount of times that, if exceeded, construes a material breach**  
  * Material means that it shall not exceed $500 unless there are multiple instances that exceed $10K

3. Buyer wants to buy a plot of land, and asks Seller to give assurance that Seller actually owns the land.  Seller sends over the following representation: “To the best of my knowledge, I am the legal owner of this land.” You represent Buyer, who asks whether he should accept this representation.  Are you comfortable with it?  
- No. The knowledge qualification is worrisome and provides Buyer with less recourse in case Seller actually does not own the land

4. Buyer wants to buy a business, and asks Seller to give assurance that no one has already sued the business, and that no one is threatening to sue the business in the future.  Seller offers the following representation: “No one has sued our business and, to the best of the knowledge, no one is threatening to sue the business.”  You represent Buyer.  Are you comfortable with this representation?

- I would be comfortable with this because Seller only knows if someone is threatening to sue the company to the best of his knowledge  
  * **Sometimes knowledge qualifiers are reasonable and sometimes they are not**  
    * **Need to be aware of what you can reasonably expect someone to know**  
      * **Third parties views/actions that are not under your control 🡪 Knowledge qualifier makes sense (future lawsuits)**  
      * **Views/Actions/Events that have taken place 🡪 Knowledge qualifier is unnecessary (selling land)**

5. False Representations

1. What happens if a seller gives a representation that turns out not to be true? Can you think of circumstances in which a buyer does not get any meaningful protection from a representation, even if he can easily show it was false?

- If a seller’s representation turns out not to be true, a buyer can sue them for damages  
- A buyer would not get any meaningful protection from a false representation if the seller subsequently was insolvent

- **2 Reasons Buyer Might Not Get Recourse for False Representations:**  
  * **1\) The K gives you protection but sometimes the protection comes with a lawsuit and it isn’t worth the hassle**  
    * **Lawsuits are expensive and time consuming**  
  * **2\) Seller is insolvent**

2. How can a buyer plan in advance to prevent this sort of problem?  
- Buyer can require part of the purchase price to be held in escrow away from seller’s control until a certain amount of time has passed and the buyer is more certain that the seller’s representations were true. If a representation that the seller gave turns out to be false, the escrow money is released back to the buyer to compensate him for the false representation

3. Explain why a buyer might demand the following language in an acquisition agreement: “Seller hereby agrees that at the Closing, upon receipt of the Merger Shares, he will immediately deposit 15,000 of such Merger Shares into escrow for a period ending no later than 42 months after the Closing at which time the escrowed Merger Shares then remaining in escrow will be returned to him.”  
- This is to protect the buyer in case one of seller’s representations turns out to be false. Then, the buyer has recourse

6. Ann owned a shopping mall during the pandemic. One of her tenants, Ben, owned a restaurant. Ben’s lease ran through 2023\. Because of the pandemic, Ben had to close his restaurant on April 1, 2020, and did not send Ann any rent for several months, starting in April. The lease had no exceptions for pandemics (or for anything else), so Ben was clearly breaching his contractual commitment. Why might Ann have decided not to evict Ben? Why might she have been willing instead to forgive some rent if he agreed (eventually) to pay the rest later when his business revived? What does this fact pattern tell us about the limits of the influence of contracts?

- Ann might have forgiven Ben because she could not find a suitable replacement. Therefore, it would make more financial sense for her to forgive some rent and receive payment later than to risk having no rental income by not getting a new tenant to move in  
- Contracts are limited by the contextual circumstances they are agreed in

- You can have a contractual right that you do not want to exercise because there is no upside  
- You can make deals outside of the contractual relationship  
  * Look for the best way to make some money on a transaction down the line

- **Context of business environment is key**  
  * **Lawyers who understand this context and client’s needs can add more value to a transaction**

7. Carl is the CEO and largest shareholder of a public company, C Brands, which owns a chain of stores and a popular brand of women’s apparel called “D’s Secret.” Sales have been flat or declining for several years. In January 2020, Carl signs a deal in which a private equity firm, Evergreen, agrees to buy 55% of the stock of C Brands. The deal has a “MAC” clause, which specifically carves out “the Covid-19 pandemic,” so Evergreen cannot invoke the Pandemic as a reason to terminate the deal. In the contract, C Brands makes the following commitment: “The seller will continue to operate the business in the ordinary course and will not take any major actions without the prior consent of the buyer.”  
   1. In response to the Pandemic, most of C Brands’ stores were legally required to close. Carl decides to furlough 1,600 employees, and also stops paying rent on most of the stores. Carl also slashes employee compensation. As you read the language above, do any of these steps give Evergreen the legal right to cancel the deal?  
- Even though Evergreen cannot cancel the deal through the MAC clause, they may be able to terminate through the ordinary course of business clause. This is because C Brands had to close stores and furlough employees – this is not operating a normal course of business (to stop paying rent, laying off thousands of workers)  
  * But as the buyer, you might expect the company to take these steps. These are reasonable, universal steps for retail businesses. It is likely that if the deal closed, the buyer would have done the same steps  
  * The clause though requires the company to consult the buyer if ordinary course changes, creating a potential lever for buyer to get out of the deal

  2. Evergreen brings a lawsuit to terminate the deal. Among other reasons, Evergreen alleges that D-Brands has “"drastically \[reduced\] new merchandise receipts which, when coupled with D-Brands' failure to dispose of existing out-of-season, obsolete and excess merchandise, has saddled the D's Secret Business with a stock of merchandise of greatly diminished value." Based on the contractual language above, do you think this is a winning argument?  
- Buyer would have a similar claim that buyer wanted to be consulted before a major action  
- But this was not ordinary course of business (acquiring an inventory but not selling it)

- **If seller had warned buyer about the impending steps, then the deal would not have been terminated**  
  * All seller needed to do was tell buyer that this is what they planned to do and then run the business by buyer’s recommendation

  3. In bringing a lawsuit, what other motive might Evergreen have aside from trying to terminate the deal?  
- Evergreen did not just fundamentally disapprove of the company’s changes  
  * **They want to terminate the deal**  
  * **They want to lower the purchase price by threatening termination**

  4. Assuming the MAC clause carves out the Covid pandemic, what other clauses are there in a typical deal that Evergreen can try to use to get out of this deal? (Hint: What is a debt covenant?)

- **Debt Covenant \= If the earnings compared to debt changes, then buyer can terminate**  
  * When seeking a loan, the fact that the business is doing well today is relevant. But what is key is how the business is going to do in the future  
    * Build in triggers which alert the bank that the loan might have become riskier than they initially thought  
    * **Use ratios to ensure loan will be paid back: Cash flow should be 3x the interest obligation on the loan**  
    * **If the business is in trouble debt covenant requires:**  
      * **You have to tell the bank**  
      * **The loan comes due**

- **So buyer will rely on the third party to understand the health of the business: seller’s debt covenant breach gives buyer a termination option**  
  * Deal is off if you breach your debt covenants and can’t correct them

8. “Symmetry” Rationale for MAC clauses: When a seller and a buyer sign a contract, they presumably expect to close the deal in a few weeks or months, but sometimes things change.  
   1. Why might a seller regret selling and want to cancel the deal?  
- The business starts doing better than when they agreed to the deal initially, and they can get a higher purchase price  
  * Could be because of better market conditions or a product innovation that happen in between signing and closing

  2. Assume the seller is a public company, and the relevant jurisdiction requires shareholders to vote to approve a deal before the deal can close. If the seller’s business is doing well in the weeks before the shareholder vote, how confident can the buyer be that the deal will close? What if the seller’s business is doing badly?  
- Buyer will be more confident that the deal will close if the seller’s business is doing badly because shareholders will be more okay with getting rid of it  
  * **When the market changes after signing to improve value of business, the shareholders can stop it**  
  * **When the market changes after signing to hurt value of business, the shareholders can approve it**  
  * **Buying shareholders do not need approval either way**  
    * **This gives the seller an edge of protection on the deal between signing and closing. It gives the seller a backstop if the deal seems bad for them between signing and closing**

- Process:  
  * Board signs the merger  
  * Shareholders ratify the merger through vote

  3. The buyer’s stockholders do not have to vote to approve a deal. Does this put buyers at a disadvantage if conditions change after a deal is signed?  
- Yes, because a seller’s stockholder approval will reflect the condition of the current state of the market and business. It serves as a protection against bad deals. The buyer does not have this advantage  
- Buyers are at disadvantage

  4. Assume that corporate law gives sellers an advantage over buyers, in affording sellers (but not buyers) ways to back out of a deal if market conditions change. Is there a reason why sellers might want to give up this advantage and “level the playing field”?  
- Sellers may want to level the playing field to get buyers to be more confident in their purchase and therefore raise the purchase price  
- Increase in purchase price  
  * More buyers is better for seller (auction) creates competition  
  * Buyers only want to bid on the best situations  
  * So sellers will want to level the playing field to get more bidders  
- Built-in seller advantage of having back-out protection means that there are fewer buyers to express  
  * Sellers cannot waive DE law  
  * **So you can give the buyers a back-out advantage too. This levels the playing field. They do this by giving buyer a MAC Clause**

  5. How could sellers make the playing field more level? What kind of clause could they use? Note that some commentators call this a “symmetry” explanation for the relevant contractual term.  
- **Symmetry explanation for MAC Clause: Give buyers that same back-out provision that the seller has if the market changes after deal is signed**  
  * **Not perfectly symmetrical**  
- Schizer: Doesn’t buy this explanation totally because it is not perfectly symmetrical

  6. Once again, we see the need for contractual (or other) responses to incentive and information problems. What does the term “moral hazard” mean and how does it apply to this issue?

- Moral Hazard: Parties who are protected (insured) against risk are more likely to make risky decisions  
- This applies because the seller’s stockholder approval of the deal for a public company protects them against risk of making a bad deal to begin with. So, sellers may try to make aggressive deals, knowing that if they make a bad one, the stockholders will not approve it

9. Investment Rationale for MAC Clauses: Fran is the CEO of Seller, which owns residential real estate. She signs a deal on July 1 to sell the company to Buyer, which also owns real estate. The deal is scheduled to close on December 31\.  
   1. Fran knows that she is unlikely to stay on after the merger closes. What issue does that create for Buyer?  
- Fran has no incentive to run the business well or work hard, knowing that in six months she will be fired. This is a problem for Buyer who wants to buy the business in its current state  
- This is an incentive problem after a deal is signed. What if between signing and closing the buildings burn down. We need a mechanism to make sure the selling management cares and still feels like the owner

  2. How important is it to continue to maintain the properties and to renew the relevant leases? How motivated is Seller’s management to pursue these goals?  
- Maintaining the properties and renewing the relevant leases is extremely important to Buyer because this is what they are purchasing  
- Seller is not very motivated to pursue these goals because they will not benefit from accomplishing them – only Buyer will because Seller’s price is locked in

  3. What kind of incentive problem are we describing? How could a MAC clause play a role in addressing it? Note that some commentators call this an “investment” explanation for a MAC clause.  
- Moral Hazard: Now that seller has been paid, they don’t care about what happens to the company – risk is on Buyer  
- Agency Costs: Seller is running Buyer’s company without incentive to run it well  
- Investment Rationale for MAC Clause: MAC clauses can solve this problem because if Seller does not conduct its normal jobs in its regular course of business and its business starts to falter, Buyer can terminate the deal through the MAC clause and Seller will be left with a failing business

10. Assume that an acquisition agreement includes the following definition of a “material adverse change” or “MAC”:

    *“Material Adverse Change” shall mean any event change that is materially adverse to the business, assets, or operations of the Company; provided, however, that none of the following shall constitute a Material Adverse Change: changes in the national or world economy or financial markets as a whole or changes in general economic conditions that affect the industries in which the Company conducts business or any change in applicable law, so long as such changes or conditions do not adversely affect the Company in a materially disproportionate manner relative to other similarly situated participants in the industries or markets in which they operate.*

    1. Like other MAC clauses, this one has three components. First, it says that a deal can be cancelled if there is a “material adverse change.” Please quote the relevant language.

- “*Material Adverse Change” shall mean any event change that is materially adverse to the business, assets, or operations of the Company”*  
  * Very broad out from deal

  2. The second component of MAC clauses is a list of exceptions or carve outs, which do not justify a change. Please quote the relevant language.  
- “*none of the following shall constitute a Material Adverse Change: changes in the national or world economy or financial markets as a whole or changes in general economic conditions that affect the industries in which the Company conducts business or any change in applicable law”*  
  * Narrowing the out with a broad exception

  3. The third component creates “a carve out from the carve out.” Something that otherwise would be excluded can still justify termination of the deal in some circumstances.  What are those circumstances? Please quote the relevant language.  
- *“so long as such changes or conditions do not adversely affect the Company in a materially disproportionate manner relative to other similarly situated participants in the industries or markets in which they operate.”*

  4. In the clause above, does the buyer or the seller bear the risk of economic downturns and other general market conditions? Why do you think the risk is allocated in that way?  
- Buyer bears the risk of general market conditions and economic downturns  
  * The carve-out applies  
- This risk is allocated to the buyer because these are foreseeable because they happen commonly and should be baked into the purchase price of the deal  
  * This is inherent in the idea of being a buyer  
    * You will reap benefits of future upturn  
    * You will bear risk of future downturn

  5. In the clause above, does the buyer or the seller bear the risk of firm-specific problems? Why? Does this allocation of risk make sense?  
- Seller bears the risk of firm-specific problems  
  * Buyer can still get out if bad thing in the world is having a worse effect on the seller than others  
- This risk is allocated to the seller because it imposes the risk on the seller of bad seller management. To keep the deal and not have buyer back-out, seller must do as well as everyone else is doing  
  * This deals with the incentive problem (not about symmetry)

  6. Assume that the language above was used in a deal that closed in October of 2019\. Assume the seller is an online retailer that delivers groceries and other products to people’s homes. Assume that the pandemic has increased demand for the seller’s services, but reduced its profitability (because its costs are higher). Under this MAC clause, is the buyer able to back out?  
- No. Buyer cannot back out because these are conditions that are impacting all businesses – not just the one the buyer is purchasing  
  * Clause 1: Bad thing happened in the world. Buyer out  
  * Clause 2: General market conditions caused change. Buyer in  
  * Clause 3: This retailer is not doing worse than other retailers. Buyer in  
    * MAC Clause does not apply

  7. The same as “f,” but the seller is an airline that has no local routes and runs only international flights. These routes, connecting the U.S. to Europe and Asia, have all been cancelled. Under this MAC clause, is the buyer able to back out?  
- Ambiguity here  
  * Seller: If this airline is compared to every airline in the world, you look worse than other airlines. Buyer out  
  * Buyer: If this airline is compared to every airline doing international flights, you aren’t worse than other airlines. Buyer in  
    * Key: Is this buyer similarly situated?

- Yes. Buyer should be able to back out because the pandemic conditions impacted this airline disproportionately in comparison to other airlines because of its specific routes  
  * Clause 1: Bad thing happened in the world. Buyer out  
  * Clause 2: General market conditions caused change. Buyer in  
  * Clause 3: This seller is doing worse than other sellers. Buyer out

  8. Assume the seller owns a chain of restaurants across the United States, and assume there is an act of terrorism in Metropolis, a major U.S. city where half of seller’s restaurants are located. In response to the act of terrorism, consumers in Metropolis are more cautious and many stop going to restaurants, but consumers in other cities do not change their behavior. Can the buyer invoke this to get out of the deal?

- Ambiguity here  
  * What does it mean to be similarly situated?  
    * Compared to other chains with 50 percent of their restaurants in Metropolis 🡪 Seller is not doing worse than the general market 🡪 Buyer in  
    * Compared to other chains generally 🡪 Buyer is doing worse than the general market 🡪 Buyer out  
  * **Schizer: Given the purpose of the clause, which is to control seller management, you should limit the clause’s application to things that the seller can manage/control. Buyer in, deal closes, MAC should not apply**  
    * It is not seller’s responsibility between signing and closing to change where restaurants should be or what airline routes are best  
      * This is seller’s responsibility but not between signing and closing

- Buyer will probably still need to execute the deal because the carve-out calls for MAC-based termination when there is impact that is “disproportionate manner relative to other similarly situated participants in the industries or markets in which they operate.” This business was not disproportionately impacted in comparison with other businesses in the market where it operates, Metropolis  
  * Clause 1: Bad thing happened in the world. Buyer out  
  * Clause 2: General market conditions. Buyer in  
  * Clause 3: This seller is doing worse than other sellers

# 6: Spin-offs (Cooperation to claim tax losses)

- Regulatory arbitrage: Look for situations where you can get an advantage by doing the same economic thing: Buying and selling tax benefits  
- To claim tax differences, parties need to trust each other  
  * Problem of cooperation

- NOL: Hold onto deductions to avoid paying tax in another year  
  * Carryback: Applied to earlier year  
  * Carryforward: Applied to later year  
    * Carryback is better:  
      * 1\) Timing advantage (lower present value of the tax; get the money now)  
      * 2\) Rate advantage (for every $1 deduction, it was worth 14 cents more)  
- Congress hoping to give US companies cash tax refunds during pandemic  
- Spin-off tax problem:  
  * Spin-off can amend a prior year tax return (use the carryback provision in CARES Act to get the advantages above) only with the cooperation of the parent company to carryback spin-off’s losses on the parent’s prior return. Then the parent gives spin-off the refund money  
    * The tax matters agreement governs the cooperation between the parent and subsidiary  
  * Note: Many of the shareholders in the spin-off are also the shareholders of the parent so they want the companies to cooperate because either way they will reap the benefit of the $14M no matter how it is divided

1. The **economic value of a tax deduction is the amount of tax it allows you to avoid**. 

   1. Is the ability to deduct $1 of expense worth $1?

- No. It is worth the amount you would have had to pay in tax on $1

  2. Assume that a corporation’s tax rate is 21%. If the corporation earns $1, how much tax must the corporation pay?

- 21 cents

  3. Assume now that the corporation is able to deduct a $1 expense. How much tax does the corporation avoid? What is the economic value of this $1 deduction?

- 21 cents avoided/deducted

  4. **The economic value of a deduction depends on a taxpayer’s tax rate.**

2. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the U.S. Congress passed the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. One of its provisions enabled taxpayers to “carry back” net operating losses (“NOLs”). As background, let’s cover a few basics of how NOLs are taxed in the U.S.  
   1. Assume that Corporation (a U.S. taxpayer) has $9 million of revenue in 2020 and $10 million of expenses. Do you expect Corporation to pay any tax in 2020?  
- No tax because losses exceed revenue and therefore the corporation has no income  
  * NOL: The deduction alone does not generate income. Instead, save the deduction and use it in another year  
  * NOL cannot be used as a refund  
  * NOL cannot be used in current year

  2. How is its “net operating loss” (“NOL”) of $1 million treated? The U.S. corporate tax rate is 21%. Do you expect the NOL to generate a $210,000 tax refund in 2020?  
- The NOL is carried forward to a following year to be used as a deduction  
- No, the NOL does not generate a $210K refund. Instead, 80 percent of the NOL ($800K) can be deducted from income in a future year where the company has income (more revenue than expenses)

  3. Starting in 2018, U.S. corporations with NOLs could only “carry forward” tax losses. “Carrybacks” were no longer allowed. What is the difference between a carryforward and a carryback?  
- Carryforward \= Current policy; Allows corporation to use NOLs on future years where they have income  
- Carryback \= Allowed under the old policy; Allows corporation to use NOLs by amending a return of a prior year to which it had income  
  * Carrybacks were eliminated in 2018 when Congress reduced the corporate tax rate. Eliminating carrybacks was a way to pay for the reduced rate

  4. In the above example, Corporation generates a $1 million net operating loss in 2020\. Assume that Corporation had more than $1 million of net income in 2019, and expects to have more than $1 million of net income in 2021\. If only carryforwards are allowed, in which year would Corporation deduct its NOL? What if carrybacks are allowed?

- If only carryforwards, Corporation’s only option is to deduct $1M in 2021 if they have income  
- If carrybacks are allowed, Corporation will want to deduct $1M in 2020 because it is guaranteed that they will use the NOL (the income is already generated) and also using a carryback lowers the present value of the tax (you always want to use deductions immediately rather than wait)  
  * Schizer: Guarantee is not really an advantage (just advantage of higher, more valuable rate and time value of taking deductions as soon as you can)

3. In the CARES Act, Congress authorized taxpayers once again to carry back losses (as they used to be able to do before 2018), but only losses generated in three years: 2018, 2019, and 2020\. Assume that Businessco had $5 million of taxable income in 2017, $5 million of taxable income in 2018, and $2 million of NOLs in 2019\. Because of the pandemic, Businessco expects to have more losses in 2020\.   
   1. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: “**The CARES Act allows Businessco to get a tax refund for its 2019 NOL \-- and thus to access more cash \-- sooner than it otherwise would**.” In light of your answer, what policy do you think Congress was pursuing?  
- Yes. Through the CARES Act, Businessco can use its losses to prior years where it had income instead of waiting for future year income. This helps businesses because they do not have to pay as much in tax in the present year. Businesses can instead use that money for rent or payroll  
- Congress was trying to stimulate the economy by helping businesses keep more cash in years they are struggling and get more cash into the economy. Get corporations to take tax refunds now so that there is more cash in their pockets

  2. The U.S. corporate tax rate was 35% in 2017 (and in years before then), and this tax rate was reduced to 21% in 2018\. What was the value of a $1 tax deduction in 2017? What about in 2018? In which year would you prefer to take a deduction?  
- 2017 $1 Deduction \= 35 cents  
- 2018 $1 Deduction \= 21 cents  
- You would rather take the deduction in 2017

- **2 Things Government Is Doing through CARES to be generous to corporations:**  
  * **1\) Allow carrybacks (get money sooner which is better for struggling corporations who need cash but also better because of time value of money)**  
  * **2\) Deduct in 2017 and you get more money, more deduction because of the higher rate**

  3. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: “**Through the CARES Act, the U.S. government used the tax system to get cash in the hands of corporations by making tax refunds more generous**.”   

- Yes.

4. Hotelco, a publicly-traded U.S. company, owns a chain of U.S. hotels catering to business travelers. In the 1990s, Hotelco branched out, opening a number of theme parks and casinos throughout the U.S.. In 2017, Hotelco hired a new CEO, Carla, who decided that casinos and theme parks are very different from hotels, so they should not be operated together. So she put all of Hotelco’s theme parks and casinos into a subsidiary, and on January 1, 2018, Hotelco “spun off” this subsidiary, “Recreationco,” to Hotelco’s shareholders as an independent publicly-traded company.   
   1. What is a “spin off”?  
- A parent company creates a spin-off division as an independent entity  
  * A spin-off is initiated when the company [expects the spin-off may be worth more](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050415/what-are-some-more-common-reasons-divestiture-occurs.asp) independently than as part of the parent company

- **Opposite of an acquisition**  
  * **When a group of businesses that have been operating together split up**

  2. Assume a shareholder owned one share of Hotelco before the spin. Would she still have this share after the spin? What else would she have?

- Yes. This shareholder would have the share of Hotelco and a share of the newly created company, Recreationco  
  * In a spin-off, existing shareholders of the parent company receive shares in the newly created "spin-off" company, essentially getting a share of the new company, distributed on a pro-rata basis based on their existing shareholdings in the parent company

5. Continuing with the facts of the prior problem, assume that Hotelco used to be very profitable, but the company had very large losses in 2018, and less significant losses in 2019 (as it started to make a comeback). Although 2020 started out better, the pandemic changed that overnight, so Hotelco expects large losses again in 2020\. Specifically, the results are as follows:

   2013: $100 million profit

   2014:  $100 million profit

   2015:  $100 million profit

   2016:  $100 million profit

   	2017:  $100 million profit

   	2018:  $200 million loss (Hotelco)

   	2019:  $50 million loss (Hotelco).

1. Under the CARES Act, Hotelco can carry back losses five years (e.g., from 2018 to 2013). If it does not have enough income to use those losses, it can carry the remainder back four years (from 2018 to 2014), and then three years (to 2015), and then two years (to 2016), and then one year (to 2017). Assuming that Hotelco carries back its $200 million loss from 2018, in what years does it deduct it?

- 2013 and 2014  
  * $100M each year

2. In what years would Hotelco use its $50 million loss from 2019?  
- 2015 as a partial deduction of $50M

3. The CARES Act allows a company to waive its right to carryback losses, and to carry them forward instead. You are Hotelco’s tax advisor. Should Hotelco carry back its 2018 and 2019 losses to earlier years? Why or why not?  
- Hotelco should carry the losses back for two reasons:  
  * 1\) Carrying back losses is better because it allows Hotelco to use the deduction immediately which lowers the present value of the tax and Hotelco expects to have losses in 2020 as well so using these NOLs is not guaranteed going forward (because they might not have income to offset). So, Hotelco should use the NOLs now to make sure they use them at all  
  * 2\) If Hotelco can carry back losses to get a higher rate (35 percent) on their deduction in a previous year. But in the future years, deductions will be worth less at a lower tax rate (21 percent)

4. If Hotelco has $100 million of losses in 2020, could it carry all of that back?  
- Yes. It could carry those losses back to 2015 ($50M) and 2016 ($50M) because those are within the five-year carryback period

5. What if Hotelco has $300 million of losses in 2020\. Could it carry all of these losses back?

- No. Hotelco can only carryback $250M of the $300M losses to prior years because it does not have enough income to offset $300M of loss

6. Continuing with the same facts, business has not been good for Recreationco either since the spin. Recreationco lost $50 million in both 2018 and 2019\. Recreationco also expects losses in 2020 because its theme parks and casinos all had to close in mid-March because of the pandemic.  
   1. Do you think Recreationco would want to carry back its 2018 and 2019 losses back to earlier years? Why or why not?  
- Yes, if it was possible, Recreationco would rather carryback to get the two advantages above

  2. Before January 1, 2018, Recreationco was wholly owned by Hotelco. As a result, for the tax years before 2018, Recreationco did not file its own tax return. Instead, as part of Hotelco, its results were reflected in Hotelco’s tax return. Compared with Hotelco, is it easier or harder for Recreationco to carry back losses?  
- It is harder for Recreationco to carry back losses because it had less prior years of making income  
  * They didn’t have their own tax return in the prior year to amend

  3. Do you know whether the CARES Act provides Recreationco with a way to carry back its losses to the years before the spin off?

- It allows Recreationco to attribute its losses to its parent company’s income in years before the spin-off if they agreed on this in the tax matters agreement. They needed to work through its former parent company by having parent claim a refund on its return and giving the spin off the money

7. In a spinoff, two businesses that have been affiliated \-- and thus have filed a single tax return together \-- become independent businesses, which each file their own return. To prepare for the spinoff, these businesses have to come to an agreement, usually called a “tax matters agreement,” about how they will handle this transition. The following are relevant portions of the tax matters agreement for the spinoff of Recreationco. 

   *1.01: Hotelco has the right to amend any Hotelco tax return with respect to 2017 or any earlier years.* 

   *1.02 Recreationco shall not carry back any U.S.federal income tax Item to 2017 or an earlier tax year.*

   *1.03 Any refund of U.S. federal income Tax received from a Taxing Authority by Hotelco or Recreationco with respect to a Hotelco return shall be the property of the Hotelco, regardless of whether all or any portion of such refund is attributable to any credit or deduction of Recreationco.*  

1. What financial benefit would there be for Recreationco to carry back its $100 million of losses (from 2018 and 2019\) to 2017 or earlier? What is the financial value of this benefit?

- Recreationco can get a cash refund in the present year from amending a prior return of $35M (because the corporate tax rate in 2017 and earlier was 35 percent). It would be $21M if amending a year after 2017  
- This is a $14M benefit

2. If Recreationco wants to carry back these losses, does the tax matters agreement give it the ability to do so? What (if anything) can Recreationco do to tap this financial benefit?  
- The tax matters agreement does not give them the ability to carry back losses  
- Recreationco instead should try to attribute the losses to Hotelco so Hotelco can claim them or it can carry the losses forward to a future year

- **2 Elements Give Rise to the ability to claim the $14M tax deduction:**  
  * **1\) Carryback – Only Hotelco amend its previous returns**  
  * **2\) Current tax losses – Only Recreationco has the losses**  
    * **Companies to work together to generate the benefit**

3. Under the tax matters agreement, which company has more leverage in any negotiation?  
- Hotelco has more leverage in negotiations because Recreationco needs them to do the return, and they are the party who is losing money  
  * But they do not have that much leverage because Hotelco needs Recreationco to use the current losses

4. Richard, the CEO of Recreationco, asks Carla, the CEO of Holdco, to help Recreationco carry back its losses. You are Carla’s mentor, and she calls to ask you for advice. Should she agree? What should she ask for in return?

- Carla should agree because Hotelco can share in the $14M tax benefit  
  * Cannot be done as a favor because Carla has an obligation to her own shareholders  
- Carla could ask for a piece of the profit from the tax avoidance. She should also make the deal contingent on if Hotelco has more losses in future years that they can no longer carryback to prior years because Hotelco used the income to help Recreationco carryback its losses, then Recreationco must pay Hotelco that amount

8. Grace is the general counsel of Hotelco. Carla calls Grace and says, “We’re thinking about partnering with Recreationco to carry back their losses. If we do this, I want to be protected from all risks. Can you please identify the relevant risks and figure out how to protect us?” You are Hotelco’s outside counsel, and Grace calls you with the following questions:  
   1. Recreationco has $100 million of losses from 2018 and 2019\. To carry back this amount, which company is going to file for this refund \-- Recreationco or Hotelco? Assume that Recreationco’s tax return for 2018 and 2019 has not been audited yet, so it’s possible that the I.R.S. (the tax authority in the U.S.) will challenge parts of it. Does this possibility create a risk for Hotelco? If so, what should Hotelco do?  
- **Hotelco will file for this refund because it is their tax return to amend**  
- Yes, this creates credit risk for Hotelco because the government hasn’t confirmed Recreationco’s $100M of losses. If Recreationco’s claim that the $100M losses is inaccurate, then Hotelco is on the hook for these because they are amending Hotelco’s return  
  * Hotelco is depending on the accuracy of Recreationco’s claim  
- Hotelco should stipulate in the deal with Recreationco that Recreationco is financially responsible for the cost of any additional charges from audits  
  * This risk is Recreationco’s risk because you are going to know if these losses are correct  
- If Recreatioco doesn’t have the money, then Hotelco is out of luck  
  * **DD: So Hotelco should audit Recreationco themselves**  
    * Vet the quality of the losses themselves  
- **Indemnity: Hotelco could also take the part of the $100M worth of losses (the part that Recreationco’s tax audit thinks is uncertain) and put it in escrow until after the audit**  
  * Allow the money to generate interest for Recreationco in treasury bonds  
  * Recreationco gets the money back if the audit is clean  
- **This is a combination of DD and indemnity to address this risk**

  2. Hotelco has $500 million of income from 2013 through 2017\. Hotelco has $250 million of losses in 2018 and 2019\. Remember that Hotelco is allowed also to carry back losses from 2020, and does not know yet how much its losses will be in 2020\. Does this create a risk for Hotelco in partnering with Recreationco to carry back losses? If so, what can Hotelco do about this?  
- Yes, this creates risk for Hotelco because if Hotelco’s 2020 (or thereafter) losses are greater than the remaining $250M of income they have from the previous years, they will not be able to use their losses  
  * If Hotelco takes Recreatioco’s losses, they risk not using their own future losses  
- Hotelco should stipulate in the deal with Recreatoinco that Recreationco is financially responsible for the cost of any future NOLs that go unused due to Recreationco’s use of Hotelco’s prior income  
  * Hotelco can also just wait and see to know what their 2020 losses are and then decide if they want to cooperate with Recreationco  
    * Hotelco might only agree to this if they have capacity

  3. Grace says the following to you: “The CARES Act was very generous, giving us an unexpected tax benefit. Do you think the U.S. government might pass more legislation like it?” Does this possibility create any risks for Hotelco in partnering with Recreationco to carry back losses? If so, what can Hotelco do?  
- Yes, this creates risk for Hotelco because the benefits of more legislation like the CARES Act might go unused by Hotelco if they allow Recreationco to use their prior income  
- Hotelco should stipulate in the deal with Recreationco that Recreationco is financially responsible for the cost of any unused benefits from tax forgiveness legislation passed in the following 2 years due to Recreationco’s use of Hotelco’s prior income

  4. Recreationco has been losing a lot of money, and business continues to be very bad. What risk (if any) does this create for Hotelco in partnering with Recreationco to carry back losses?

- This creates a credit risk for Hotelco (explained in 8a)

# 7: VC (Staged Financing, Incentive Compensation)

- VC is interesting for K problems because:  
  * Every transaction has some asymmetric information and uncertainty but there is extreme in VC start-ups (founder knows more; no idea if this technology will work)  
    * These problems can prevent transactions unless creative solutions develop to build trust and motivate people to them  
  * There is an important advantage in studying VC – Management has extra autonomy (can be used to prove its own interests instead of the best of the company)  
    * There are few parties involved  
    * Easy to monitor management (unlike public companies)  
    * No coordination problems  
    * When VC’s get involved, the only investors are probably angel investors  
- These make VC like a lab: How can experts address these extreme problems with full incentives and ability to do it?  
  * Expert investors: When information is not equal, that discourages the transaction. But the expert investors lower the asymmetric information imbalance  
  * Staged Financing: Rounds of funding structure  
    * Gives expert investors the advantage of time to bridge the asymmetric problem  
    * Also solution to incentive problems: Creates a structure for founder to demonstrate success early on to justify new round of investing  
    * Also signaling: The very fact that founder would accept only a preliminary investment gives you information about their confidence in the company  
    * This only works because there are expert investors  
- But solutions themselves have problems:  
  * Founder puts a lot of power in hands of VC  
  * If VC doesn’t give second round of funding, that signals to other investors to not invest either  
    * So why wouldn’t VC pretend to not want to renew the deal until they re-negotiate?  
      * Reputation, repeat players. VC can only do that once or twice  
        * Reputation is a powerful asset to overcome information and incentive problems

1\. Assume that Ellen has an idea for a new business.  She wants to hire professors to teach courses online, and to charge people for taking these courses.  But Ellen needs money to start “Learn-online, Inc.”  She has two potential investors.  One, Schoolco, is an educational institution.  The other, Pensionco, invests money for the police department in order to be able to pay pensions to retired policemen. 

1. Which of these investors has potentially greater expertise about the subject of Ellen’s business?  In what ways can investors potentially add value beyond their investment?

- Schoolco has greater expertise about Ellen’s business because it is an educational institution like Schoolco  
- Investors can add value of:  
  * Networking/Industry connections/Relationships  
  * Credit/Reputation  
  * Business practices/Advice  
  * Building initial customer base  
- VC is for start-ups. The non-financial benefits are especially valuable for start-ups

2. If Ellen was also asking you to invest, would you care who the other investors are?  Would you be more likely to invest if you heard that the other investor was Schoolco or Pensionco?  
- Investors care about who the other investors are because they can influence how well the business is going to do  
  * Also want to understand how much control the other investors have (day to day business involvement? Passive?)  
- I would rather see Schoolco as a co-investor  
  * Seal of Approval: Schoolco knows this industry and the fact that they are willing to invest is reassuring to other investors  
  * When Buffet puts money into a company, the stock price goes up  
    * The mere fact that he is investing provides a seal of approval

3. Ellen plans to be the CEO of this business.  In addition to wanting the investment, she also wants to make sure she will not be replaced as CEO.  Review \-- what is this sort of conflict of interest called? In pursuing this second goal (of keeping her job), does she have a reason to prefer one employer over the other?

- This is an agency problem. Her main goal is to stay on as CEO but someone else could run it better  
  * Person running business is more interested in her own professional prospects than the success of the business

- Ellen probably will prefer Pensionco because pension funds are more passive and have less expertise so they will not bother her and will probably not know if she is doing a good job  
  * The advantages an experienced investor provides might not be advantages for CEO to the same extent as other investors want (investors want another investor can add the most non-financial value but CEO doesn’t want new investor to meddle in her work or replace her because the more experienced investor knows more)

2\. On January 1, Ellen will need $200,000 to hire technology consultants for six months to prepare the website.  The effectiveness of the website is going to be quite important in determining the success of the business. Six months later (on July 1), she will need $200,000 to hire faculty to teach the courses, which will begin on September 1\. The quality of the faculty will obviously also be important.  

In response, Pensionco offers to buy 500,000 shares of Learn-online, Inc. – representing half of the company’s 1 million shares – for $400,000.  They would pay $200,000 on January 1, and $200,000 on July 1\.

But Schoolco’s offer is different.  They are offering to pay $250,000 on January 1 for two things: first, ¼ of the shares of the company (250,000 shares); and second, an option to buy another ¼ of the company (i.e., another 250,000 shares) on June 30 for $250,000.  Although Schoolco would have the right to buy these additional shares, they are not obligated to do so. 

1. Does each offer ensure that Ellen has the money she needs to launch the business?  
- Only Pensionco’s offer guarantees her the ability to launch the business. This is a firm commitment – certainty  
- Schoolco is willing to pay more per share but does not give all the money up front

  2. Why might Ellen be tempted to take Schoolco’s offer?  Why might she be worried about doing so?  
- She might be tempted to take Schoolco’s offer because they are in the same industry, better non-financial reasons, but also they can offer her more money per share  
- She might be worried to take this offer because it doesn’t actually lock in financing to get this launched

  3. Why do you think Schoolco is willing to pay more?  What are they getting in return?  Why do you think they value the extra business term they are seeking?  
- Schoolco is not willing to commit everything up front and wants to make another decision in a few months because they will be able to get in and evaluate the business  
  * **Time can give you more information: Schoolco is willing to pay more for the privilege of deciding whether to stick with the investment later**  
- **Staged Financing: Fund you now and see how it goes and then we will decide whether to fund you again**  
  * Critical feature of the VC industry  
- Pensionco might not value the time to make a future decision as much as Schoolco because they do not have the expertise to evaluate it  
  * **Time is only useful if you have the expertise to evaluate how the investment is going**  
  * Expert investors can make informed judgments on how it’s going, but Pensionco is not an expert  
    * Pensionco won’t know much more in a few months than they know now

  4. Let’s say Ellen makes a counteroffer to Schoolco, saying she will agree to their terms if they agree to decide whether to make their second investment – not on June 30 (after six months) – but on January 6 (after six days).  If you were advising Schoolco, would you think this change in timing is significant?  
- Yes. Because the **more amount of time gives you more opportunity for evaluation** (to make an updated judgment)

  5. If Ellen is unwilling to take Schoolco’s offer, does that tell us something about her prediction for the business?  
- Yes. **Ellen’s unwillingness to take the higher but more uncertain offer will signal to the investor that she doesn’t believe in the idea**  
  * Truly confident CEO would take Schoolco’s offer and less confident CEO would take Pensionco’s offer

- Value of Staged Financing:  
  * 1\) Time for Expert Funder to evaluate investment, update the valuation, and decide if they want to continue  
  * 2\) Signaling how confident the owner is that the company will succeed

- **High tech start-ups have a lot of uncertainty. Addressed by:**  
  * **Expert investors who know enough about technology to evaluate the initial investment (but they still don’t have as much information as the Founder – still have information asymmetry) so:**  
  * **Expert investors use staged financing to pay to evaluate their decision at a later point and gain information from the Founder about her confidence in the idea**  
- **These mechanisms also addresses an incentive issue for the Founder to lie about how good their idea is**

3\.   Assume that Ellen takes Schoolco’s offer.  Assume also that six months later, Schoolco decides not to buy the additional 250,000 shares.  At that point, Ellen goes back to Pensionco to ask if they want to invest.  If you are advising Pensionco, would it matter to you that Schoolco had decided not to invest?

- Yes. If another investor, with more expertise than they had and worked with the Founder, decided to pass after a few months of working with the Founder, then they will likely pass too because the initial investor’s pass signals that this is not a good company

- **Problem for Ellen: Once she agrees to this structure, she is putting herself at Schoolco’s mercy**  
  * If it is going badly 🡪 Schoolco is out  
  * If it is going well 🡪 Schoolco can pretend to be out and then re-negotiate the terms of their deal more favorably because other investors will not work with her after seeing this Signal  
- **So, Ellen’s rejection of Schoolco’s initial offer could be a signal of lack of confidence or a signal that she doesn’t trust Schoolco**  
  * **So it is hard for Schoolco to know at the outset if her rejection of their offer is due to lack of confidence in her company or due to her lack of trust in them**  
    * **Repeat Players: This vulnerability doesn’t actually come to fruition for the CEO because there are not many players so a VC’s poor reputation can be problematic for it to get the next deal**

- **Imbalances of information**  
  * **Contractual mechanisms meant to bridge the imbalances**  
  * **This also aligns incentives**  
- **Incentive Problem: Capital provider can try to manipulate or re-negotiate**  
  * **But they don’t want to do that because if their reputation takes a hit then they won’t get to work with the other players**

- VC Idea: 1 in 10 will succeed, 2 in 10 will survive, the rest will fail 🡪 Failure is not embarrassing  
  * Ellen can fail and come back and get funding in the new venture  
  * Firms can make poor investments and get new great venture deals

4\.  What is a “right of first refusal”?  Why is it costly to grant one?  If it is, why would anyone offer one?

- Right of first refusal: Agreement where you give someone the option to invest in something first, and they have the option to turn it down before any other investors can come in  
- It is costly because:  
  * You lock in a price and forgo possible auction bidding  
  * If the investor says no, depending upon how informed they are, their answer may be a negative signal to the rest of the industry which would make it hard for you to sell someone else  
- Grant one anyway because:  
  * You can get more upfront money  
  * It signals confidence (especially given the reputational constraints on investors noted above)

5\.  Do you agree or disagree with the following statements?: 

a.  	As long as the underlying business makes sense, it doesn’t matter who owns it or how the ownership is divided.

- False.  
- Owners matter (expertise)  
- Structure matters (staged financing, incentive alignment)  
- Can’t just say if the product will work I will invest. A lot goes into if the product will work: owners, capital, incentives created

  b. 	In structuring a new deal, we should use the structure from a past deal as a model (or “precedent’).

- True to some extent.  
- Want to model a deal on another deal makes sense because you don’t need to reinvent the wheel. However, you cannot hold onto the precedent too closely because there is new context

  c.  	**We need to structure a deal to reflect what each party brings to the table**.

- True.  
- Schoolco and Pensionco want different deal terms because one of them brings expertise which makes staged financing valuable and the other doesn’t so they do not want to pay for that extra time

  d. 	**Current structuring can affect future bargaining**.

- True.  
- As soon as Ellen consents to the staged financing, she is opening herself up to a strategic re-negotiation by the investor  
  * But she can be confident in the fact that the industry monitors poor behavior and penalizes it

5. **When we structure a deal, we need to focus on the information each party has (or does not have)**.   
- True.

6\.  What is venture capital?  What type of businesses do venture capitalists (“VC’s”) finance?

- **VC is start-up, high-technology investing** (new technologies incubated by small companies)  
  * Need both components  
- **Asymmetric Information and uncertainty exist in every transaction, but exist here more than in other industries** 

7\.  A Columbia law professor named Adolph Berle (writing with Gardiner Means) identified a problem in public corporations, which they called “separation of ownership and control.” The problem was that there were so many owners that individual owners did not have an incentive to monitor the business, so managers had too much power, which they could use in self-interested ways.  Does this problem arise when venture-capitalists make investments?

- This problem does not arise in VC because there are small number of investors and employees so it is easier to monitor  
  * **VC has extreme uncertainty/information (both in the company and the Founder)/incentive problems but lacks other common problems like transactions costs and monitoring costs (like public company)**

8\.  Venture capitalists often specialize in a particular sector.  Why?

- Specialization even within types of technology because investors get more expertise which lowers the information asymmetry  
- They can gain the expertise and make the relationships by focusing their time on one particular sector more deeply than if they invested in many different sectors  
  * This makes them more attractive to founders and more equipped to evaluate the value of good investments

9\.  Do venture capitalists usually invest all at once or invest in stages?  Why?

- **Staged financing is an important component of VC because it gives:**  
  * **1\) Opportunity for evaluation of the investment (not all in right away)**  
  * **2\) Signaling of founder confidence**  
- **Staged financing and expert investors solve information asymmetry**  
  * **Expert investors: People know enough about the particular sector that they have a better chance than most to understand the viability of a certain idea or certain Founder**  
  * **Because the investors are experts, they want staged financing because it allows them to re-evaluate the company down the line. The additional time helps to bridge the asymmetric information problem**  
    * **Although they know less now, they will know more in the future when they need to decide whether to allocate more capital**  
- **Staged financing also helps align incentives because to get another round of funding, the Founder must demonstrate success early on**  
- **Staged financing also signals to investors the confidence of the Founder by demonstrating that Founder is willing to accept preliminary funding because he thinks he will be successful enough to earn a future round**  
- **Staged financing also creates a problem by putting a great deal of power in the hands of the VC (see re-negotiation issue)**  
  * **But this can be minimized by repeat players/reputation**

10\. Beth offers you the following proposal: If you invest $1,000, she will use it to develop a cure for the common cold.  She is close to a cure, but there are no guarantees.  If she is successful, your $1,000 will be worth $100,000.  But she could fail, leaving you with nothing.  What risks do you see in this proposal?

a.  	In dealing with these risks, are you comforted or are you more nervous if this investment is one of several that you make? Does diversification help with uncertainty? Or asymmetric information? Or agency costs?

- Diversification of investment helps with uncertainty because it is more likely that one will succeed and outweigh the costs of the failures (we will be right once)  
- **Diversification does not help with asymmetric information and agency costs because all the VC investments present the same asymmetric information and agency cost (incentive problems) at every company**  
  * These are systemic issues that could be true at every company so diversification won’t help this  
  * 10 founders can cheat you just as easily as 1

  b. 	Does it matter if you personally have expertise about developing drugs? Can this expertise help with uncertainty? Or asymmetric information? Or agency costs?

- **My personal expertise developing drugs makes the investment less risky**  
- **This expertise lowers the problems associated with uncertainty, asymmetric information, and agency costs because:**  
  * **Uncertainty is lessened if I have some knowledge of what is going on**  
  * **Asymmetric information is lessened because I can evaluate the company**  
  * **Agency costs are lessened because Founder knows I can evaluate what he is doing effectively**

- This makes me more confident in the investment (better able to assess), limits the information the owner can keep from me because they know I can evaluate it, and empowers me to assert my views  
  * For agency costs, the person you are dealing with is less likely to do what is good for them (and not you) if they think you are less likely to notice. Expertise empowers me to notice and lets founder know I can notice so they are less likely to keep things from me

  c.  	Let’s say that Beth is very wealthy and can finance the investment herself.  Is that fact relevant to your decision about whether to invest?

- Yes. I would be less likely to invest because this is a signal that Beth does not trust her own company because she does not want the risk of investing her own money

  d. 	Let’s say you learn that Beth is going to do some of the relevant research as part of graduate work she is doing in biochemistry.  Is that relevant to your decision? How might it be helpful? How might it be unhelpful?

- This might be helpful because the university credentials, validates her (they trusted her so I should too)  
- This might be unhelpful because she is going to prioritize research findings over a commercially viable product  
  * Mixed motivations (is her heart in the business or the degree?)

  e.  	Let’s say you learn that Beth plays a lot of golf.  Is that relevant to your decision?

- Yes. This would mean that Beth is less invested in making the product work

6. Can we use a contract to address the risks you have identified?  If this is hard to do, why is it hard?  
- This is hard to do because these are life decisions Beth is making outside the scope of the employment of the product. It is difficult to control her life decisions within a business contract

7. Do you agree with the following statement and, if so, why? “**An organization can substitute for a contract**.”  
- We do not rely on detail specific contracts to specify how we go from idea to product  
- **Instead, we have to create the conditions in which information is exchanged as needed to build trust and in which people have incentives to do what is in the interest of the business and not themselves**

11\. Would it help if Beth in the above problem is paid a small cash salary, and her main compensation is shares in the new venture? When an entrepreneur and a venture capitalist strike a deal, how is the entrepreneur usually paid?  Why?

- Yes. The entrepreneur is usually paid in equity with a small cash salary. This incentivizes the entrepreneur to work hard at making the best possible product because their wealth is directly tied to the success of the company

- **Key Pillar of VC: Incentive compensation**  
  * Note that this is different from staged financing  
  * People doing the work will prioritize the things you want them to because there is a lot at stake for them personally  
    * **You don’t need to contract exactly what needs to happen if you can motivate the founder to want what you want**

12\.  Steve founds a computer company. He takes a modest salary and owns all the equity in the startup. He comes up with a new type of personal computer, and needs capital to produce and sell them. Venture Capital invests $2 million in exchange for convertible preferred shares, which can be converted into common shares representing ⅓ of the company. The preferred stock has extra voting rights, entitling the VC to four of the company’s six board seats.

1. Is it typical for VCs to control the company before it goes public?

- Yes. VC’s do not own a majority of the business but they have majority voting control (This is control beyond their economic investment)

2.  Why or why not?

- Founders have so much inherent control (your idea, your operations)  
  * Founder has so much asymmetric information that it’s a problem for VC  
  * Founder has control on day to day basis  
  * VC has legal control

- VC’s need this voting (legal) control to compensate for the day to day control the Founder has  
  * They want say in when business is sold etc.

3. What risk does an entrepreneur take in giving venture capitalists control rights?

- Risk of being replaced  
  * Jobs fired from Apple early on  
- Repeat players 🡪 Reputational Constraint  
  * **VC firms do not replace founders often because they don’t want to have that stain on their reputation or they will not get the best Founders**

4. When do venture capitalists lose their control rights?  What incentive does this create for an entrepreneur?

- **VC’s have preferred stock with extra voting rights that turns into common stock without extra voting rights control at IPO**

- **Incentive Mechanism (like incentive compensation): Founders want to IPO so that they can undo the control**  
  * **At IPO, Founder gets money but also job security**  
  * **This aligns incentive with VC’s wanting an IPO so that they can sell their stock, cash out, and invest in a new venture**

5. Are there reasons why a venture capitalist might hesitate to fire an entrepreneur, even if she has the legal right to do so?

- Reputational Constraints

13\.  So far, we have focused on the relationship between start-ups and their venture capitalist investors. But there is another relevant relationship: Venture capitalists often have partners in their funds, like universities and pension funds. Let’s turn to the issues that can arise in that relationship and the ways VCs address them.

1. We have discussed incentive and information problems that arise when VCs invest in startups. But are there **incentive and information problems that arise when universities, pension funds, and other investors invest in VCs**? How do the latter issues compare with the issues the VCs themselves face in deciding whether to invest with an entrepreneur?

- Less uncertainty with a VC than with a new technology. VC’s have a track record that the investors can look to  
- But similarly to a VC-Founder investment, there are large gaps in understanding what the VC investments look like  
  * Asymmetric Information – The VC’s have the expertise in the portfolio that the university investor doesn’t have  
  * Incentive Problem – The VC has reason to tell the university that they will do a great job  
- **Same problems that exist at portco level, exist at the fund level**  
  * **Experts say they can generate value but hard for other investors to understand due to asymmetric information and incentive problems**

2. How do universities, pension funds, and other investors compensate venture capitalists?  Why do you think the pay takes that form?

- Incentive Based Compensation:  
  * Small management fee – 2%  
  * **They don’t make any additional money unless they earn profit**  
    * The profits are shared between VC and Founder  
      * Usually VC takes 20 percent of profits and investors get the rest

- **They themselves get compensated in the same way that they compensate the founders**  
- **At one level, the VC’s have an interest that are perfectly aligned with their investors 🡪 They both want profits**  
- **However, there is incentive misalignment because the compensation structure promotes risk:**  
  * **The VC gets 20 percent of profits but bears none of the losses (these are on the investor)**  
    * Challenge of Incentive Compensation: Aligns incentives but if taken too far it can cause a party to take unnecessary risk

3. If a university invests in a venture capital fund, is there a particular date on which it is supposed to get its money back?  Why are VC funds structured in this way?

- VC’s in effect use staged financing also for the outside investors  
  * You come into this fund with us. Give us money for a particular period of time, and we will return it back to you  
  * Then the VC’s hope is that investor will come back for Fund 2 and Fund 3  
  * They will always do this, but it is up to the investor whether they want to keep investing  
- Investors can try it once and decide later if they want to keep going. They will do this only invest again if it worked the first time

- **2 Critical Elements Used at Both the Portco and VC level:**  
  * **1\) Staged Financing**  
  * **2\) Incentive Compensation**

14\. Assume that University invests $1 million with VC. University agrees to pay a 2% annual fee ($20k), and also to share 20% of **profits above** a 10% **annual return (called a “carried interest”)**. VC uses University’s money to invest $500k in each of two ventures, A and B.

1. After two years, VC sells its position in A for $1 million, doubling University’s money. A 10% return on $500k over two years is approximately $100,000. The profit above that level, therefore, is $400,000. How much should VC receive?

- VC receives: $40K (2 years of 2% annual fees) \+ $80K (20% of profits above $100K) \= $120K

2. What if B goes bankrupt in the following year, so that University loses all $500,000 invested in it. Obviously, VC gets no carried interest for B, since there is no profit. But is there a problem with the carried interest that VC has already claimed for the investment in A.

- Yes, because now University has paid VC too much because the deal was for total profits (not for profits in A only). Total profit is now $500K  
  * The carry of $80K is wrong because the first investment generated it, but the second investment failed  
  * 10% annual return for 2 years of the whole investment \= $200K so profit above 10% annual return \= $300K. Therefore, $300(20%) \= $60K  
  * Clawback \= $60K

3. What is a clawback, and why are they included in VC funds?

- Clawback \= VCs (general partners) take back some of the carried interest given to the other investors (limited partners) when the initial payout was incorrect

4. Under U.S. law, does the “carried interest” earned by the VC seem more like salary or an investment? Do you know whether it is taxed as ordinary income or capital gain?

- **Carried interest is a salary bonus for investing the other investors’ money, but it is taxed as capital gain**  
  * Too generous treatment because it is a bonus for a job well done but it is taxed as capital gain when it vests

15\. Which of the following terms do you think are likely to appear in University’s contract with the VC.

1. University generally will have its capital returned by a set date, with a limited exception for exceptional circumstances.

- Yes.  
- This is the staged financing. There will be a time limit

2. The VC cannot sell or transfer its general partnership in the fund to anyone without University’s consent.

- Yes.  
- When you invest with a VC, you invest in the team that is there. Limited partners do not trust a new regime

3. The VC cannot invest in businesses owned by individual partners in the VC firm or their family members without University’s consent. 

- Yes. Greater agency costs and more asymmetric information so VC can do something for their own best interest  
- Why allow the consent possibility?  
  * Maybe the family members will be prominent tech entrepreneurs. Don’t want to shut the possibility out entirely but just shut it out if it done for the wrong reasons

4. The VC cannot operate any other funds.

- **No. Staged financing model means that investors can re-up into new funds**  
- **But this creates a risk for investor: Because then VC can find a great investment that investor is not a part of**  
  * **VC would say that to ensure you are in everything we do, you just need to re-up into a new fund (part of the stage financing model)**  
    * Usually if you are in one fund, VC allows you to be in another automatically  
  * **Or VC will say that they will try to include as many of their funds as possible in each opportunity. So the fact that you are in one of these funds means that you will get a slice of what they do overall**

# 8: VC (Capital Structure, Incentive Compensation, Tax)

- VC is unique area because it has unusually concentrated:  
  * Uncertainty  
  * Information asymmetry  
  * Can generate incentive problems  
  * No free riding because of small amount of repeat players (focused allocation of capital)  
- Incentive misalignment

- 4 Qualities of VC Investors:  
1) Subject matter Experts  
   * Bridges asymmetric information  
2) Staged Financing – Addresses asymmetric information and incentive problem  
3) Incentive compensation – Monitoring entrepreneur by having the founder monitor herself by financially rewarding her for company’s success  
4) Control Rights: Right kind of success (IPO) means Founder gets control of company back

- VC’s confront similar problems with their funders and use same solutions:  
  * 1\) Staged Financing  
  * 2\) Incentive compensation

- Tax planning structure in VC super-charges the incentive compensation (by taxing it at capital gains rate):  
  * Debt: Paid first, no upside  
    * Not a lot of debt in VC because there aren’t many hard assets  
  * There are different tiers of ownership interests:  
    * Plain Vanilla Preferred Stock: Paid first fixed amount, larger dividend, little upside  
      * Functions like debt when there isn’t any  
    * Common Stock: Residual claimant, paid last after preferred stock  
    * Convertible Preferred: Preferred stock that converts to common stock if you choose  
      * Usually will be discounted (worth 9/10 of common stock share)

- When to use Common/Preferred?  
  * Mature company with a lot of assets that is acquiring a boutique company  
    * Market reaction is mixed: Issue plain vanilla preferred stock (we have more assets than debt so you will get paid no matter what even if acquisition is bad)  
      * Could be good because new company could refresh the brands of acquirer  
      * Could be bad because companies don’t fit  
    * Issue common stock where market reaction is that this is very good  
- **Note: In VC, shareholders are forced to convert at IPO**

- Tax treatment of VC  
  * Incentive compensation plays an important role in the VC industry to solve information asymmetry and incentive problems  
    * Don’t need to monitor founder anymore – she will monitor herself  
    * Industry has also developed to use US tax law to supercharge that incentive by taxing it at the capital gain rate  
      * General Rule: When you get paid in property, you include FMV in income  
      * But in VC: Stock you get must vest before you keep it  
        * **Default Tax Rule: You don’t pay tax until stock vests. Pay at ordinary rates when it vests (and then from there the changes after vesting are capital gains/losses)**  
        * **83(b) Election: Pay value of stock today at time received. Choose to pay FMV on stock at time you get it before it vests and pay capital gain on changes thereafter**  
          * It is as if you got cash and used the cash to buy the stock  
          * Value your stock as low as possible at time received  
            * **Incentive to offer low valuation (when you are reporting at ordinary rate)**  
          * Can’t low ball valuation when you have stock in public company  
          * But with private company, the deals are structured so that it isn’t obvious to the government what the valuation is  
            * **Convertible preferred stock to VC investor gives Founder discretion to say that they are getting something different (their common stock) than the VC investor so they can report a low valuation and pay less in ordinary, more in capital gains**  
      * Cost to this strategy:  
        * Company loses deduction  
        * **Companies don’t actually mind because they don’t have offsetting income yet**

**1\.** Background: Two Types of income

A. What are the two types of income in the U.S. tax system? Which type do taxpayers usually prefer?

- Capital gain is preferred to ordinary income

B. How is income from performing services usually classified?

- Ordinary

C. What about gains from selling a profitable investment?

- Capital gain

D. Ann starts her own business and owns 100% of the stock. Through her hard work, the value of the stock doubles, so she sells it to a private equity firm. Is her profit taxed as ordinary income or as capital gain?

- Capital gain  
- The difference between capital gain and ordinary income is not always clear  
  * **The reason the investment did well is because of her personal work, measured in an increase in the stock price so taxed as capital gain**

E. Ann runs Barbara’s business, and makes it much more profitable. Barbara rewards Ann with a generous bonus. Is this bonus ordinary income or capital gain?

- Ordinary income  
- Conceptually, these are similar situations, taxed differently  
- We want to convert our labor/work to look like an investment gain (capital gain)

2\. Please compare the following three types of equity securities \-- common stock, “plain vanilla” preferred stock, and convertible preferred stock \-- using the following criteria:

- Convertible preferred stock is a hybrid  
  * Convertible preferred acts like preferred stock as long as you do not convert  
    * Business failing: Acts like preferred stock and you are paid fixed amount before common stock holders  
    * Business successful: You can convert to common stock and become a residual claimant  
      * Usually not a full share (9/10th) which makes it slightly worse than common stock if business succeeding

1. Which would you rather have if the company’s business is doing really well?

- Business successful: Common stock because you have unlimited upside (not capped at the fixed amount like plain vanilla preferred)  
  * You are residual claimant (if all other claimants like debt and preferred stock holders have been paid, everything else is yours)

2. What if the business is doing badly?  
- Business failing: Plain vanilla preferred stock because you are first in line to collect if company is insolvent, and you will collect a fixed amount (behind debt which is rare in VC-backed companies because start-ups don’t have hard assets)

3. Do you think they will have the same voting and control rights?

- They all have different voting power and control rights

3\. Before considering the significance of these differences in a VC-backed start-up, let’s begin with another setting: a consumer products company. Proctor & Scramble (“P\&S”) manufactures and sells a large portfolio of “name brands,” which are popular with consumers, including detergent, hand soup, paper towels, toothpaste, and similar products. The company has $1 billion of debt outstanding, and the value of its outstanding equity is $2 billion (suggesting that its assets are worth $3 billion).  

P\&S has just hired a new CEO, Alice, who comes from the “edgier” world of marketing to young people. P\&S’s board is concerned that the company does not appeal enough to the younger generation, and that its image is a bit old-fashioned. In her first six months, Alice decides to acquire a company \-- Millennial Mania (“M\&M”) \-- which markets “hipper” products to younger people. 

Alice’s believes that the two companies will complement each other. M\&M will help to “refresh” P\&S’s brands, and will provide a pipeline of new consumers. But some market analysts worry that the two companies are not compatible at all, and that the acquisition might end badly. Alice needs $500 million in cash to buy M\&M, and she reaches out to Bill, her investment banker, to consider options for raising this cash. 

1. Alice asks Bill about issuing $500 M of common stock. Before answering her, Bill reads a negative story about the deal in the financial press. “M\&M is a niche firm for flakey young people,” a prominent market analyst is quoted as saying, “and its employees have complete contempt for a business like P\&S. If these two companies are brought together, they will be looking to part company soon.” Given this coverage, why might Bill hesitate to recommend common stock?

- **If you sell common stock, you need people to believe in the transaction**  
- If the market is unsure about the transaction, you should not get common stock

2. Instead, Alice asks Bill if P\&S should issue $500M of “plain vanilla” preferred stock to fund the cash acquisition. It will pay a 3% dividend (compared with the 1% dividend yield on P\&S common) and has a liquidation preference. If the acquisition does not go well, how will the preferred shareholders do? How does their situation compare with that of common stockholders?  
- Preferred stockholders will do better than the common stockholders because they have a liquidation preference (and have a higher dividend payout)  
  * Preferred stockholders still get paid even if the business fails (as long as they have some assets to pay you with)  
    * There are $3B in assets here and $1B of debt that claims above you. But then there is $2B left. You come in ahead of everyone else to claim that $2B  
- **Preferred stockholders do not need to believe in the acquisition**

3. What if the acquisition goes well (as Alice hopes)? How will the return on the preferred compare with the return on the common?  
- Return on the common stock would be better (preferred stockholders only get their 3% return)  
  * Preferred stockholders will not participate in any upside

4. Instead of “plain vanilla” preferred, Bill recommends convertible preferred, which pays only a 1.5% dividend, has a liquidation preference (only if shareholders don’t convert), and can be converted at the shareholder’s option at any time for five years; each preferred share can be converted into .9 shares of common. Why do you think he makes this recommendation?

- Convertible preferred  
  * Bigger dividend than common, smaller than plain vanilla preferred

- **Market loves deal 🡪 Sell common**  
- **Market wary 🡪 Sell plain vanilla preferred**  
- **Market is unsure (sees potential for upside and potential for problems) 🡪 Sell convertible preferred**  
  * Liquidation preference if things go badly  
  * 9/10th of upside of common if things go well  
  * This is the security that VC’s use in a start-up

4\. Carl was your brother’s college roommate. He majored in computer science, and has been working for Apple. He and your brother meet you for coffee, and Carl mentions that he has an idea that could revolutionize digital streaming of video content, making it faster and more reliable. 

You mention that you have some money saved up, and you and some friends might be interested in investing. 

Carl says, “That could be interesting, but I want to be open about something. This is a risky bet. The big tech companies are working on this too. I have a better idea, but I have to work fast. If they develop something that’s almost as good before I’m done, the industry is just going to go with that, and we will miss this opportunity.” You say you understand and you and Carl begin discussing terms. 

1.  Carl’s annual salary at Apple is $300,000. He says he wants the same salary from you \-- “or it’s not worth it to me to do this” \-- and he offers you and your friends 100% of the equity in the newly-formed company. What incentive does this create for Carl? What signal do you think Carl’s proposal sends about his confidence in his idea?

- Low incentive for Carl and signals low confidence  
  * He is not interested in owning a part of the business  
2. Instead of the proposal in A, Carl says that he is giving up a $300k salary at Apple, and will work for a $75,000 cash salary \-- just enough to cover rent on his studio apartment, food, and health insurance. He wants to own 51% of the equity in the newly-formed company, even though you and your friends are supplying all of the capital. What incentive does this create for Carl? What signal do you think this proposal sends about his confidence in the idea?

- This incentives Carl to work hard  
  * He is taking a pay cut, but he doesn’t look at it like this because he thinks the cash he is giving up is worth less than the stock he is getting  
  * This is the way the industry works (less cash, more stock)

3. Carl’s initial proposal is that everyone gets voting common stock. Why might you be concerned about giving Carl 51% of the voting rights?

- Carl would make decisions on his own without consulting investors  
- This voting control is on top of the day to day control he has and the asymmetric information he had about the idea

4. You tell Carl that you want 51%, and he objects. “I’m going to develop a great idea, and I don’t want you to kick me out of the company as soon as it succeeds. That’s what happened to Steve Jobs the first time he was CEO of Apple, and I won’t make that mistake\!”  You explain that you are comfortable giving him control once the idea proves itself, but that you and your friends need control before. Assuming he agrees, is there a way to work this out using preferred stock? Is there also a way to do it without preferred stock?

- Allocation of control is a problem that needs to be figured out at the start of the company (each side worries that the other will take advantage of it)

- Preferred Stock Solution:  
  * Founder gets common stock – one vote per share  
  * VC gets preferred stock with extra voting rights – two votes per share  
    * Convertible preferred stock automatically converts, losing extra voting rights, when there is an IPO  
      * Capital providers’ preferred stock converts automatically to common at IPO  
- **Control rights allocation is why convertible preferred stock is so popular/uniform in VC (virtually every deal done the same way)**  
  * Start out favoring the VC until the idea is proven at IPO and VC has recouped investment and more  
  * **Founder incentivized to get to IPO to get control back**

- How else could you do it with just common stock 🡪 Voting Rights Agreement:  
  * Founder enters into K with VC where investors get 20X voting rights and this K expires at IPO  
    * **Because allocating control rights can be accomplished through the voting rights agreement, there must be other reasons for the preferred stock practice**

5. Carl wants you and your friends to invest $2 million for your share of the equity. He is putting in only his idea and his effort, but no capital, as noted above. He will use the $2 million to cover salaries for a small team of programmers, office space, and computers. At the “burn rate” he projects, the $2 million will last for just over 18 months. After 18 months, assume that another company wins the race to develop an idea like the one Carl is trying to implement, so Carl’s approach is unlikely to be adopted. If you have preferred stock, how valuable is your liquidation preference likely to be in this scenario?

- Liquidation Preference: Who gets paid first  
- Not useful to have a liquidation preference when there are no assets left

- **Liquidation Preference is Not valuable in a VC setting because the company is either a complete success or fails (there are usually no assets to claim)**  
  * **Another explanation that doesn’t work to justify the convertible preferred issuing**  
  * Two tiered capital structure (with VC getting preferred shares) is not meant to protect cash flows of VC because there are no assets remaining

6. Please compare this fact pattern with the one above about P\&S’s acquisition of M\&M. Is a liquidation preference in a high-tech start-up likely to be more or less meaningful than in a consumer products company? Why?

- Liquidation Preference is much less meaningful in startup than consumer products company

5\. The Gilson & Schizer (“G\&S”) article analyzes the economic significance of various features of convertible preferred stock in high-tech startups financed by venture capitalists.

1. What are dividend preferences? How significant are they in VC-backed firms?

- Dividend preferences \= Who gets the dividend first  
  * Preferred shareholders with a dividend preference get paid before common stock  
- If common shareholders receive a dividend, then preferred shareholders have to receive that dividend first. But if common stock is not paid in dividends, preferred shareholders are not required to be paid  
- Is dividend preference valuable in consumer products context?  
  * Yes. These companies commonly pay dividends  
- Is dividend preference valuable in VC startup?  
  * No. No expectation of dividend  
- **Dividend preference is meaningless in VC**  
  * **Another explanation that doesn’t work to justify the convertible preferred issuing**

2. What are liquidation preferences? How significant are they when a VC-backed startup fails?

- Not valuable

3. How significant is a liquidation preference when a VC-backed start-up is sold to another firm? (Hint: the article focuses on what it calls a “zombie” scenario.)

- In some situations, a liquidation preference can be valuable to a startup investor: when the startup gets bought by a bigger company, the money will first go to preferred stockholders with a liquidation preference (VC’s)

4. How significant is a liquidation preference when venture capitalists sell their shares in an initial public offering?

- **Not valuable at all if the company does well**  
  * **If startup fails 🡪 No liquidation**  
  * **If startup succeeds 🡪 With an IPO, the convertible preferred converts to common and liquidation preference goes away**  
    * **In both situations the liquidation preference is in the same position as the common (non-preferenced shares)**  
    * **The only situation where liquidation preference is helpful is when the start-up is bought by a bigger company. Then, the preferred shareholders (VC) will get their money first. But this is pretty insignificant because VC’s are not investing in start-ups wanting this result**

5. Some commentators argue that giving VCs convertible preferred pushes entrepreneurs to “signal” whether they really believe in their idea. Please explain this argument. Do you agree with it?

- Founders give VC’s liquidation preference to show confidence (if things go badly, they will be paid first)  
  * **But this doesn’t signal anything to VC’s who know that there will be no assets to collect and know the liquidation preference is meaningless**  
  * **Another explanation that doesn’t work to justify the convertible preferred issuing**

6. Some commentators argue that giving VCs convertible preferred motivates entrepreneurs to be successful enough that VCs sell shares in an IPO, instead of a sale to another company. Please explain this argument. Do entrepreneurs have other reasons to prefer an IPO to a sale to another company?

- VCs may want to sell a portfolio company to another larger company because the VC retains their preference in an acquisition but has to convert in an IPO. Founders want to encourage VCs to exit in acquisition rather than IPO because VC will control less of the company after acquisition  
- This also doesn’t explain the need for convertible preferred because either party can block the other from exiting  
  * **Another explanation that doesn’t work to justify the convertible preferred issuing**

7. Does convertible preferred give venture capitalists extra control rights? Does this explain the ubiquity of convertible preferred? Are there other ways to accomplish this goal?

- Convertible preferred gives VCs extra control rights  
  * This doesn’t necessarily explain why VCs want convertible preferred because although you allocate control rights through it, there are other ways to allocate this

- **VCs take convertible preferred because of tax reasons**

6\. Let’s turn to the tax planning issue, which is the key point in G\&S. As we discussed in an earlier class, in the United States there are two types of income. Salary income is classified as “ordinary income” (taxed at a maximum federal rate of 37%) while profit from a risky investment is classified as “capital gain” (taxed at a maximum federal rate of 23.8%). 

1. Assume that you hire Ed to run your privately-owned company, and you pay him $300,000 of cash. Is this payment ordinary income or capital gain?

- Ordinary income \= Salary

2. If you pay Ed $200,000 of cash and $100,000 in gold bullion, what tax rate applies to the gold?

- Ordinary income \= Salary  
  * The tax law looks at the reason you are getting the money on how to tax it. Not the form that the payment takes

3. Assume you pay Ed $200,000 of cash, and you also grant Ed $100,000 of stock in the company in 2021, which will vest in 2023\. Assume that in 2023, the stock is worth $500,000. Assuming Ed does not make any special tax elections, how much income does he have in 2021? Is it ordinary or capital? How much income does he have in 2023? Is it ordinary or capital?

- $200K cash is ordinary income  
- Stock hasn’t vested yet  
  * 2021: No tax  
    * **General Rule: You do not pay tax until stock vests**  
  * 2023: Ordinary income included at the full amount \= $500K

4. The same facts as in “C,” but Ed makes a so-called “83(b) election,” in which he chooses to pay tax on the value of the stock when he receives it (even though the stock has not vested yet). This means he has $300,000 of income in 2021\. Is it ordinary or capital? In 2023, this stock is worth $500,000, so Ed sells it. What is Ed’s profit on this stock in 2023? Is this profit taxed as ordinary income or capital gain?

- 2021: $200K cash is ordinary \+ $100K is ordinary  
  * Pay tax at ordinary rates on stock for what it is worth when you receive it  
- 2023: $400K is capital gain  
  * Treated as if he bought it for its worth in 2023  
  * The profit is treated as capital gain  
- Very common for Founders to make 83(b) elections  
  * **Pay tax upfront at ordinary rate; Pay gains later**

5. If Ed expects the stock he receives as compensation to appreciate, does he increase or reduce his tax bill by making the election to pay tax when he receives the stock (instead of waiting and paying tax later when the stock vests)? Why?

- Reducing by conversion

6. So far, we have assumed that the value of Ed’s stock is $100,000 when he receives it. But let’s assume instead that the value isn’t clear. If Ed elects to pay tax when he receives the stock (the 83(b) election, described above), and his goal is to reduce his tax bill, is he motivated to offer a high estimate of the stock’s value when he receives it? Or a low estimate? In other words, as a matter of tax planning, does Ed want to claim that the stock is worth a lot, or very little, when he receives it?

- **Ed wants to claim that the stock is worth very little when he receives it because this is the amount he pays a higher, ordinary rate on** (then the appreciation of the stock he pays capital gains on so he would rather have more of the stock allocated to the capital gains rate)  
  * 83(b) election encourages claiming a lower valuation at first

7. Assume that at the same time that Ed receives stock, Frank \-- an outside investor \-- pays $100,000 for identical shares. Does Ed have any discretion in the value that he reports to the tax authorities?

- No. The value is given by fair market value (what a third party would pay for it)  
  * The outside investor leaves the Founder no room to change the valuation of his common shares

8. The same as in “g,” but Frank pays $100,000 for convertible preferred shares, and Ed receives common shares. Does Ed still have to report $100,000 as the value of his stock?

- This time he can report less  
- **As soon as you can show that third party investor is paying for something different, Founder can say that the valuation of their convertible preferred is lower and that lower valuation means that they pay more in capital gains and less in ordinary on the stock if they elect**

9. G\&S offers reasons why convertible preferred shares actually should not be worth much more than the common stock (e.g., the dividend and liquidation preferences have only limited effect). If these observations about the economics of common and convertible preferred shares are correct, does the tax strategy still work?

- **All the criticisms about how convertible preferred is not that different from common undercut the ability of people to differentiate convertible preferred from common for tax reasons too**  
  * **However, litigating on valuation is something the government does not want to do because valuation challenges do not set precedents** (only single scenarios)  
- **A key reason why convertible preferred has to look different than common (even though the differences are not that great) is that Founder can report a much lower valuation for the common stock**

10. President Biden proposed to tax long term capital gains at the ordinary income rate for anyone earning more than $1 million per year. If this proposal is ever enacted, would this proposal affect this tax planning strategy?

- Yes. The tax planning strategy that benefits Founders which underpins why VCs take convertible preferred stock will no longer be viable so you will see more variety in VC capital structures  
- Schizer interviewed VCs about this as well

7\. In tax planning, it’s important to consider the tax consequences to *all* parties to the transaction \-- not just to your client, but to everyone. 

1. Assume a company has $10 million of revenue, and pays $2 million of compensation (and has no other expenses). How much is its taxable income? Is compensation tax-deductible?

- $8M  
- Compensation expense is deductible  
- Companies want full tax credit for compensation expenses

2. In problem \#6, we saw that there is an advantage to Ed in offering a low estimate of the value of the stock he receives \-- so he reports less ordinary income. Does this strategy affect the amount that the company can deduct as compensation?

- Ed has advantage in offering low estimate of value, but this lowers the deduction the company can claim  
  * The company’s deduction is limited to the amount that the employees report as ordinary income  
  * **This tax strategy that underpins the VC industry comes with a cost \= The startup (not VC) loses tax deduction**

3. If Ed’s planning strategy imposes a tax cost on the company, then won’t the company block this planning strategy? For example, can’t the company just force him to report a higher amount? In the venture capital context, why is the company often not concerned about its tax deduction?

- Yes. The company can assign its own valuation to the stock and the government would then audit Ed  
- **But in the VC context, the companies do not challenge the valuation the employee reports because the companies do not have income at the early stage, making deductions they could get nearly irrelevant**  
  * Company is willing to super-charge incentive compensation for its employees by making sure that they get capital gain, and the fact that the company loses its deduction doesn’t matter to it because it doesn’t have any income anyway  
  * Note: This is not free because the company could carry the losses forward (NOL). But they don’t need it still because they have so many losses and so little revenue  
- A consumer products company would not use this strategy because they have income, less losses, and do not want to play games with valuation

8\. G\&S argue that the tax strategy we are discussing is, in essence, a subsidy for venture-capital backed startups. 

1. What is the trigger for the subsidy?

- They need a VC investor to take convertible preferred shares and put money into the startup  
  * VC will take a different security so Founder can low ball the valuation of his different security

2. For the government to put money into a transaction (through a reduced effective tax rate), who else must have “skin in the game”? If you were asked to design a subsidy for startups, would you want to include this feature?

- **Government is putting in money (by giving up tax revenue it could collect) only when expert VCs believe in the deal and put money into it**  
  * **The VCs trust in the company is the trigger for the government’s subsidy**  
  * If you can get a VC to put money in, government will put money in too. But they are not going to analyze it (unlike if the government made a grant and spent the resources to analyze it themselves)  
- 2 Approaches to Look at this:  
  * **1\) Grant-making model**: Government is releasing money without monitoring  
  * **2\) Expertise model**: Government doesn’t have the expertise to decide which technologies will succeed and which will fail (and there are political dynamics involved too), so we would rather not have a government agency make the decision. Instead, let government piggyback on the expertise of VC’s  
    * The tax subsidy is only triggered when VC is putting in money

- Couldn’t this subsidy occur with a non-expert VC putting in money?  
  * Yes, but that doesn’t happen often  
  * Additionally, subsidy is only happening (allowing Founder to pay at capital gains) when the investment is successful

9\. Let’s review the issues we have covered with another fact pattern. Gail, who was your closest friend in college, writes software for Apple. Her dream for years has been to launch her own startup. Using her savings and a contribution from Henry, her father, she starts a business called “Gamer Gail,” which she forms as a Delaware corporation with 10,000 shares. Henry owns 5,000 shares and Gail owns 5,000 shares. 

Paying herself a minimal salary and working out of her basement for two years, Gail writes code for video games. Gail has creative ideas for games and she figures out a way for her graphics to be especially vivid. Her first game, in which the player rescues penguins from global warming, gets positive reviews and modest attention in gaming circles. 

After two years of struggling to stay afloat, Gail knows that she needs more capital to hire a marketing team and more programmers, so she can develop more games and bring them to market more quickly and more effectively. Gail cannot yet count on retained earnings to fund this expansion, since Gamer Gail is not yet profitable and probably won’t be profitable for at least three more years. 

Gail begins a discussion with Irene, who is a managing director at Gaming Ventures (“GV”), a VC firm that specializes in funding video game startups. Irene proposes to invest $2 million. In return, she wants GV to own one-third of the company. She proposes that there should be five board members: Gail, Henry, Irene, and two of Irene’s partners from GV. 

Gail is willing to let GV control the company until Gamer Gail proves itself and becomes commercially successful, but once this happens, she wants control. Since she is doing the work, she also wants more shares as compensation for this effort. 

Gail’s counteroffer is that GV will get 5,000 shares on September 1, and the company will also issue 5,000 more shares to her on September 1, bringing her total share ownership up to 10,000 (with Henry and GV owning another 10,000). In principle, Irene agrees to Gail’s proposal (i.e., paying $2 million for ¼ of the company and having extra board seats and voting rights until Gamer Gail proves to be successful).

Gail knows that you are a lawyer and that you regularly represent entrepreneurs who run VC-backed startups. She asks you to represent her. Gail is a great programmer, but she doesn’t know anything about capital structure or tax planning.

1. What capital structure should Gamer Gail have? Specifically, what type of securities should GV receive in return for its investment? What type of securities should Gail receive in exchange for running the company?

- 2-Tiered Capital Structure:  
  * Investors get convertible preferred  
  * Founder and her team gets common stock

2. In light of the deal that Gail and Irene have struck, how should this capital structure allocate rights in liquidation, dividends, and control rights? Which of these issues are economically significant? Which are not?

- Dividend preference to convertible preferred stock  
  * Gail and common shareholders cannot receive a dividend until VC is paid  
  * This is economically insignificant because start-ups don’t pay dividends 

- Liquidation preference to convertible preferred stock  
  * This is more significant preference than the dividend preference but not very significant because high tech startups do not have hard assets to collect if insolvent  
    * But maybe a bigger company would acquire start-up and this would give the VC a right to paid first with allocation of sale proceeds

- Control rights to convertible preferred stock  
  * But there is a mandatory conversion to common stock at IPO where convertible preferred loses its control rights  
    * This incentivizes Founder to get to IPO

3. What tax advantages (if any) are offered by the capital structure you are recommending? Who benefits from these tax advantages? Is there an offsetting tax disadvantage to another taxpayer? If so, does it matter?  

- Gail will choose 83(b) election and pay ordinary rates on the common stock which she argues has a lower valuation than the convertible preferred  
  * Small amount of ordinary and more of capital gain

- Cost: Company loses a value on its compensation deduction  
  * But the company doesn’t care because the company is not profitable yet

- What would Founder rather have – IPO or buy-out?  
  * IPO because it’s probably a bigger payday and also because the Founder maintains control

# 9: Nonprofits (Asymmetric Information and Organization as a substitute for Contract – Like VC)

- Information asymmetry and incentive problems are in M\&A, VC, and non-profits too  
  * Solve some problems and the solutions beget new problems

- **Nonprofits exist to address 2 kinds of problems:**  
  * **1\) Information Asymmetry (Hansmann):**  
    * **A) Expertise: Buyer doesn’t understand the quality of what he is buying**  
    * **B) Contact: Buyer doesn’t know if the goods/services bought will actually be delivered with quality**  
    * **C) Impact: Buyer can monitor the goods/services provided but can’t tell if his specific purchase made a difference**  
  * **2\) Incentive Problems: The market doesn’t work when social benefits of a certain kind don’t get reflected in prices**  
    * **If a bad thing isn’t reflected in price 🡪 Too much of it (pollution)**  
      * **If a good thing isn’t reflected in price 🡪 Too little of it (neighbors won’t spray for mosquitos, free riding)**  
    * **Nonprofits can be a way for people to overcome the coordination problems**  
    * **Government subsidizes nonprofit sector to make it more likely that the organizations will solve these incentive problems**

- **How do nonprofits compare with the government?**  
  * **Where massive amounts of money are involved, government is more likely to be the provider because of its taxing power and economies of scale advantages**  
  * **Where there are services that require experimentation/risk, nonprofit is more likely to deliver the service because of its political isolation**  
    * **Nonprofits also create a Double Utility of Giving which the government does not: The person who gets the good or service is happy but so is the person paying for it**

1. Review: Information Problems in High-Tech Startups   
   1. Arlene is an engineer who has an idea about how to make artificial intelligence more effective. If she pitches her idea to average investors, how effectively can they evaluate it?  
- Information Asymmetry: They cannot evaluate it well

  2. Would it be easy to draft a detailed contract specifying exactly what Arlene should do at each stage of her work in developing her new approach to AI?  
- This is difficult to foresee  
- This is constraining on Arlene’s development  
- In a situation like this which is long and complex, contracts are not appropriate substitutes

  3. True or false: **Instead of this sort of detailed contract, the VC industry structures deals—and, indeed, companies--in particular ways to address information problems and produce the right incentives. In other words, the industry uses organizations as a substitute for contracts.**  
- True.

2. Structuring as a Substitute for Contract at Nonprofits: The Nondistribution Constraint  
   1. True or false: **Nonprofits also use organizational structure—though, admittedly, a different structure—to solve information and incentive problems**.  
- True.

  2. The defining feature of a nonprofit is the “**nondistribution constraint**.” According is Henry Hansmann, who pioneered the study of the law and economics of nonprofits, a “**nonprofit organization is, in essence, an organization that is barred from distributing its net earnings, if any, to individuals who exercise control over it, such as members, officers, directors, or trustees. By ‘net earnings’ I mean here pure profits-that is, earnings in excess of the amount needed to pay for services rendered to the organization**.”

  3. Are nonprofits barred from earning a profit?  
- No. Nonprofits can earn a profit. They just can’t distribute that profit to owners/directors/management  
- **This is an organizational structure that doesn’t let you distribute profits**

3. Hansmann explained this nondistribution constraint–and, more generally, the justification for using nonprofits–as follows: “\[O\]ccasionally, due either to the circumstances under which the product is purchased and consumed or to the nature of the product itself, consumers may be incapable of accurately evaluating the goods promised or delivered. . . . In situations of this type, consumers might be considerably better off if they deal with nonprofit producers rather than with for-profit producers.  
   1. What kind of problem is Hansmann invoking to explain why nonprofits are used? How does his point connect to the main themes of this course?  
- Information asymmetry problem  
- **Consumers cannot properly evaluate what they are paying for and so the non-profit, non-distribution constraint is there to assure them**

  2. Why might nonprofits be another tool in the toolkit for dealing with this sort of issue? Why is the nondistribution constraint a potential solution?  
- **Nonprofits solve information asymmetry: The constraint works because it shows that managers are not incentivized to cheat you like another company because they can’t keep the money anyway**  
    
4. First Type of Information Problem: Expertise  
   1. Ben has serious back pain. He has no medical training.   
      1. How effective is he personally in analyzing the diagnosis he receives from a surgeon that he needs surgery?  
- Doesn’t have a lot of expertise. Not in a position to evaluate this  
  2. Does this help explain why the oldest and most prestigious hospitals in the U.S. tend to be nonprofits?  
- Because hospitals are non-profits, the company has no incentive to misdiagnose patients for more expensive procedures  
  * **You aren’t going to be cheated by wrong information because the non-profits do not have incentives to take from you**  
  * Note: This doesn’t necessarily track with for-profit hospitals

  2. Chris’s car won’t start. He has no training as a mechanic.   
     1. How effective is he personally in analyzing the need for the repair recommended by a mechanic?  
- Not effective.

  2. In the U.S., are auto repair shops usually nonprofits or for-profit firms?  
- For profit firms  
- **There is information asymmetry in both settings but only one is a non-profit organization**  
- What difference is there between asymmetry in auto repair and hospital that can save this theory?  
  * If auto repair shop fixed the car then you can understand that it’s fixed (even if you don’t know why it’s fixed or they overcharged you)  
  * If hospital fixed your back there might be other things going on with your body so the fix is not as observable  
  * **Although there is information asymmetry in both settings, you can observe that a fix happened in auto repair (not as much in doctor)**

  3. Debbie needs a lawyer to sell her home. She has no legal training.  
     1. How effective is she personally in analyzing the need for the contractual terms recommended by her lawyer?  
- Not effective.  
  2. Do most lawyers in the U.S. work for nonprofits or for for-profit law firms?  
- For profit  
- Another example of information asymmetry not used to resolve through non-profits

- **Nonetheless, nonprofits can be reassuring in setting in which it is hard to evaluate quality**

5. Second Type of Information Problem: Personal Contact  
   1. Elizabeth, who lives in NY, wants to buy flowers for her mother, Francis, who lives in Chicago and is celebrating a special birthday.   
      1. Is Elizabeth likely to buy flowers from a nonprofit or a for-profit firm? Why?  
- For-profit firm because even though she can’t observe the quality of the goods/services herself, she is in touch with someone who can tell her about the quality  
  2. Gail, who lives in NY, wants to contribute to provide emergency relief for an earthquake in Asia.   
     1. Is she likely to contribute to a nonprofit or a for-profit firm?  Why?  
- Nonprofit firm because she is not in touch with anyone that can tell her about the quality of the goods/services so the nonprofit, which legally cannot take from her for their gain, assures her that the money is going to good use  
  * She knows there is a need for repairs but cannot evaluate the quality of the repairs

- **The concern that she might be misled is high because she cannot personally or indirectly monitor (without personal contact) but the nonprofit status assures her**  
  * **Asymmetric information is much greater in the case of disaster relief than in the case of giving the flowers (even if you are not the person monitoring either, in one you have a personal contact to monitor for you)**  
    2. How (if at all) is the information problem Gail faces different from the one Ben, Chris, and Debbie faced in question \# 4?  
- **All the situations involve information asymmetry but Gail doesn’t have a reliable source of information about quality of goods/services delivered but the others do because they are the ones getting the goods/services**  
  3. Could advances in technology change her assessment of this issue?  
- Yes. Advances in technology can help Gail monitor how her money is used better which reduces the information asymmetry  
  * But for now, gift to someone you know is different from the donation to someone you don’t know

6. Third Type of Information Problem: Impact  
   1. Ilene loves to run, stroll, and ride her bike in Riverside Park. She appreciates that everyone who wants to enjoy the park is allowed to do so free of charge. She knows that the park needs to be maintained, and that New York City only covers a portion of this cost, so she decides to make a donation.   
      1. Given how much time she spends in the park, does Ilene still face the same sort of challenge as Gail in question \# 5?  
- No. She can see the impact  
  * No personal contact issue because she can observe, monitor it  
    2. In deciding whether to donate, does she face a different information problem? Can the use of a nonprofit help to address the problem in “ii”?  
- Yes. **Even if you can monitor a non-profit’s work and see if the nonprofit is doing its mission, there is still a question of the marginal impact of your donation (what specifically is your money effecting)**  
  * **The non-distribution constraint mitigates but doesn’t eliminate the information asymmetry problem**  
    * CEO can’t take the money in a nonprofit but can do other things for personal benefit

7. Review: This course has emphasized two different types of problems that can undermine an otherwise beneficial transaction. One is about information. What is the other type of problem? (Hint: It also starts with an “i.”)  
- Incentive problem

8. Externalities, Incentives, and Public Goods  
   1. Helen and Ilene are neighbors. Ilene likes to use an old wood-burning stove to heat her home. Jane sells her the wood. Unfortunately, the smoke tends to blow from her chimney into Helen’s open window, making Helen’s home unpleasantly smokey.  
      1. When Ilene buys wood from Jane, do the two of them consider the impact of their transaction on Helen?  
- No, they do not consider the impact

  2. What is an externality? Is the externality in this example positive or negative?  
- **Externality \= A type of incentive problem where two people’s transaction has an impact on a third party but the parties in the transaction do not consider the impact on the third party**  
- This is a negative externality (negative effect)

  3. True or false: **Externalities create flawed incentives because the parties to a transaction don’t have optimal incentives to avoid the relevant costs (in the case of negative externalities) or to create the relevant benefits (in the case of positive externalities).**  
- True.

  2. Helen and Ilene live on a private road, which is not maintained by their town. In the summer, there are a lot of mosquitos. A portion of the land along the road is owned by the town, but the town does not spray it with pesticides to reduce the mosquito population. Instead, the town has given permission to Helen and Ilene to spray it.  
     1. If Helen sprays the parcel owned by the town, will Ilene also benefit?  
- Yes.  
  2. If Ilene sprays the parcel, will Helen also benefit?  
- Yes.  
- **The decision that each might make to spray this has positive effect for the other (positive externality)**  
  3. What effect do your answers to part “a” and “b” have on Helen and Ilene’s incentive to spray?  
- Neither might spray  
  4. What does the term “free riding” mean?  
- When someone else benefits from another’s work/money  
- Each has the incentive to rely on the other to do it  
  * This means that there is less of the thing than there should be  
    5. Economists define a “public good” as a commodity or service that costs the same–regardless of how many people use it–and is available even to those who don’t pay for it. Is a mosquito-free neighborhood a public good?  
- Yes.

9. A distinguishing feature of venture capital is that the sector’s products—high-tech startups—have significant social value.  
   1. Is the same true of the nonprofit sector?  
- Yes.  
  2. Do nonprofits generate externalities?  
- Yes.  
  3. Do tech-startups also generate externalities? To the same extent as nonprofits?  
- Not to the extent of nonprofits  
- Tech startups operate for-profits but there could be some third-party benefits  
  4. True or false: **An important function of nonprofits, and of government subsidies to nonprofits, is to address negative externalities—and, thus, to deal with incentive problems**.  
- True.  
- **When you have situations where the market is failing (where someone needs to deal with something but everyone is waiting for another to address it), there are things that nonprofits step in to do (and get subsidized to do)**  
  * **Nonprofits aren’t only about information problems but also incentive problems**

10. Nonprofits as a Response to Public Goods and Other Incentive Problems  
    1. Mary is worried about climate change. She founds a research organization to study what causes climate change, how to slow or reverse it, and how to mitigate its effects.

    2. Is the knowledge that Mary’s organization develops a public good? Does it have positive externalities?  
- Yes, develops a public good  
- Has positive externalities

  3. Would you Mary’s organization to be a nonprofit or a for-profit firm?  
- Nonprofit because even though it is doing good for the world, it is doing good for everyone regardless of if they pay for the value created  
  * Also hard to charge people for the value creation

  4. Mary decides to work for the organization, and she obviously is passionate about its mission. How do expect her feeling about her work will compare with her friend Nick, who does data entry for a widget manufacturer?  
- She feels better about her work  
- **Incentive problem of nonprofits: The market doesn’t account for the social good that is being done and therefore it is undersupplied**  
- **Incentive advantage for nonprofits: The people who work at nonprofits are really passionate about what they do and will work hard**

  5. Based on your answer to “d,” what comparative advantage to nonprofits sometimes have over for-profit firms?  
- Workforce advantage: Nonprofits employ people who want to help others and are committed to the cause

11. Tax Subsidy  
    1. Mary’s organization runs a surplus. Does it pay tax on this surplus? What if the widget manufacturer where Nick works runs a surplus?  
- Nonprofits do not pay tax on surplus/profit  
- For-profits do pay tax on surplus/profit  
- **The government is putting in money into the nonprofit because it is helping the public good and solving the collective action problems**

  2. Mary’s friend, Olivia, donates to $10,000 to Mary’s organization. What tax benefit can she claim?  
- Olivia can deduct that amount of the donation from her taxable income

  3. Assume that Olivia’s tax rate usually is 50% (a 40% federal rate and a 10% state and local tax rate). What is the real financial cost to Olivia in making this gift?  
- It doesn’t cost her $10K. Costs her $5K  
- She would have paid $5K in tax that she gets to avoid

12. Governments versus Nonprofits  
    1. In principle, either the government or nonprofits can provide public goods and respond to market failures. For example, social security is a program that ensures that elderly people have enough resources, so they don’t become dependent on the community for food, medicine, and other basic necessities.  
       1. Do you think the government or nonprofits have a comparative advantage in running a program like this?  
- Government has the advantage because they have robust systems for gathering revenue and sending checks to people which get cheaper to conduct per person as you add more people  
  * **Where massive amounts of money are involved, government is more likely to be the provider because of its taxing power and economies of scale advantage**  
    2. What does the term “economies of scale” mean? Are there economies of scale in a program like this?  
- Economy of scale \= Cheaper program per person as you add more people  
  * Massive economies of scale with social security

  2. One way to prevent drug addicts from contracting HIV is to provide them with clean needles. Was this program first administered by the government or by nonprofits? Why?   
- Nonprofits  
- Government is politically unable to administer this  
  * **Nonprofits are able to experiment because they are independent from the political process**

  3. Where did the civil rights movement begin–in the government or in nonprofits? What about the movements for women’s rights and gay rights? What about the environmental movement? Why?  
- **Nonprofits because they have the independence to champion an idea which is not demanding a majority of support with the voting public (and hopefully will demand that support at one point)**

- **Nonprofits exist in ways that look like government functions particularly on the public good side, but they conduct themselves differently from the government on purpose**

  4. Rachel buys a birthday present for her brother Peter. Assume he loves the gift.  
     1. True or false: The gift makes Peter happier.  
- True.  
  2. True or false: The gift makes Rachel happier.  
- True.  
  3. In economics, there is a concept called “the double utility of giving.” Is illustrated by Rachel’s gift to Peter. What does this phrase mean?  
- **Double Utility of Giving: The person who gets the good or service is happy but so is the person paying for it**  
  * This is unique to voluntary giving  
    * This separate source of happiness exists for nonprofits but not for government  
    * **This is advantage for nonprofits because it creates more happiness**  
    4. When Rachel pays taxes, do you think she experiences the double utility of giving?  
- No.  
  5. What about when Rachel gives money to her favorite charity, which is a soup kitchen? Does her donation produce “double utility”?  
- Yes.

# 10: Nonprofits (Measuring and Rewarding Progress)

- Nonprofits can be viewed as a solution to the information/incentive problems  
- There are also incentive problems like free riding/externalities that can justify the existence of nonprofits (especially government funding for nonprofits)  
- But nonprofits themselves create information and incentive problems  
- Nondistribution constraint prevents money from being distributed to nonprofit management but it does not prevent other forms of value from being taken (excessive compensation not tied to surplus, office space, overstaffing, travel)  
- Harder to police nonprofits because measuring progress is more challenging without profit metrics

- VC and Nonprofits: Same problems, different solutions  
  * Asymmetric information/Uncertainty:  
    * Goals are worthwhile but hard to accomplish  
    * People closer to the issues know whether these goals are achievable or not, but they have incentive to persuade you to invest  
  * Solution for VC’s: Incentive compensation. This is not available to nonprofits

1. Review of Challenges in Venture Capital  
   1. What information problems are there in venture capital?  
- Information asymmetry: Business owner knows more about business than investors  
- Uncertainty: No one knows if it will work because no one has ever tried it  
  * Note that uncertainty is a separate information problem than asymmetry

  2. What incentive problems are there in venture capital?  
- There is incentive for Founder to misrepresent her confidence in her idea  
  * Staged financing

  3. Do you think the information problems make the incentive problems harder?  
- Yes. **In situations where information problems are harder, incentive problems become increasingly harder because people have more discretion to do what is in their personal interest rather than what is in the best interest of company**

2. Special Problems at Nonproblems: To see them, let’s compare two scenarios—one involving a for-profit firm, and one involving a nonprofit  
   1. Alice is a board member at Forprofit Corp (“FC”), and Ben is FC’s CEO. FC has two businesses: a restaurant and a catering business. At a board meeting, Ben tells Alice and the rest of the board that he wants to stop the restaurant, and keep only the catering business.    
      1. To vet this decision, what is the first question Alice should ask?  
- How profitable is the restaurant? How profitable is the catering part?

  2. Assume that running a restaurant requires more work from management than catering. Why might Ben try to hide this fact from Alice?  
- 2 Possible Explanations for what he wants to do. Motivations are hard to read because people will tell you what you want to hear  
  * 1\) He doesn’t want to work as hard – Bad  
  * 2\) He wants to reallocate costs – Good  
    * Is the self-interested course actually the best course for the company?

    3. If this is the reason why Ben wants to shut the restaurant, how feasible is it for Alice to figure this out?  
- Pretty easy. If the restaurant is more profitable, keep that open  
  * Alice can quickly check his claims by asking him about the bottom line


  2. Alice is also a board member at Nonprofit (“NP”), and Candace is NP’s CEO. NP has two programs: they run a soup kitchen and they run an afterschool basketball program for disadvantaged young people. Candace tells Alice and the rest of the board that she wants to end the soup kitchen and focus only on basketball.

  3. Compared with Ben’s proposal in the previous question, is Candace’s plan easier or harder for Alice to vet?  
- Harder for Alice to vet because there are not financial metrics to evaluate the decision  
- **This is not as obvious because it is a lot harder to monitor without financial metrics**  
  * **Nonprofits provide opaque goods**  
  * **Hard to measure social value**

  4. Assume that the soup kitchen requires more work from management. Why might Candace try to hide this fact from Alice?  
- Candace will hide this fact because if Alice finds out she may assume that the reason why Candace wants to close the soup kitchen is because of the bad reason that she doesn’t want to do more work (which may or may not be true)

  5. If this is the reason why Candace wants to shut the soup kitchen, how feasible is it for Alice to figure this out?  
- Similarly, here is an information asymmetry situation that can be explained by two different kinds of motives (one good and one bad)  
  * But this time we do not have a profitability metric to make this determination

  6. The last two questions illustrate the fundamental challenge at nonprofits that is emphasized in *How to Save the World*.  
     1. What is the problem?  
- **Difficult to measure success without profits**  
  2. Is this a problem of information? Or of incentives? Or both?  
- This is a both problem  
  * It starts as an information problem: Is this more or less impactful than the other thing we are doing or what we could do?  
  * **But it becomes an incentive problem because when information is not available, incentive problems become harder to monitor**  
    * **When information is not available, incentive problems get worse**  
    3. What parallel do you see to venture capital?  
- **Unusually challenging information problems both in VC and nonprofits**  
- **Where there are information problems, incentive alignment becomes more challenging and monitoring is less likely to work and agency costs become more serious**  
  * These are parallel situations

3. Inertia  
   1. Doug and Ellen work at Institution, which provides goods and services to the public. To do this work, Institution has standard operating procedures, which it has used for many years. What it be practical for Doug and Ellen to rethink those standard operating procedures every morning when they arrive at work?  
- No. This would be impractical. You need standard operating procedures to function

  2. Does every organization needs standard operating procedures to do its work?  
- Yes.

  3. Institution’s standard operating procedures used to be really effective. But the market they serve has changed, so Institution should change some of these procedures to keep up with the times. Are there reasons why Doug and Ellen might resist changing these procedures?  
- **Why do institutions rarely want to change standard operating procedures:**  
  * **Good reason: It has worked. And people remember the success of the procedures**  
    * Response: The success is in the past  
  * **Bad reasons:**  
    * **It is hard to change and learn and transition to a new method (increased workload)**  
    * **Risk that they will be replaced if they do not have the proper skillset for the new procedures**  
  * Blend of reasons that people inside institution resist change

  4. Do you think inertia is a challenge at every institution? Why might it be a greater challenge at a nonprofit than at a for-profit firm?  
- Challenge for both but greater challenge in nonprofits because it is harder to measure there is no headline profit number  
  * **Inertia in for-profits is communicated to leadership, employees and investors through profit margins**  
    * Losing money 🡪 Bad sign. Can’t be explained away over time

  5. Is inertia caused by information problems? Or incentive problems? Or both?  
- Both:  
  * **Information Problem: Managers do not understand that the procedures are not working (because they do not have profit metrics)**  
  * **Incentive Problem: Managers not compelled to change even when they know it is not working**  
- **Inertia exists in every institution but it is more worrisome in nonprofits because success is hard to measure**  
    
4. Challenges in Resolving Conflicts  
   1. Frank and Georgia work at Investment Bank, while Hannah and Ike work at Nonprofit. Assume that all four of them are ambitious and capable, and that they enjoy their work. Assume also that Frank and Georgia disagree about the best strategy for Investment Bank to maximize profits, and that Hannah and Ike disagree about the best way to advance Nonprofit’s mission. Why might the disagreement at Nonprofit be more heated? What connection, if any, is there to the fundamental challenge at nonprofits discussed in question \#2.  
- Problem of information – Difficult to measure performance  
- Members of nonprofit might have a different understanding of the goals they are trying to pursue

- **Disagreement at a nonprofit is more heated because:**  
  * **1\) Information:** The easiest way to resolve something is to produce objective information that both sides need to accept which is harder to have in a nonprofit because the goals are not as crisply measured  
  * **2\) Emotions:** People are at nonprofits are there because they care about the mission. They fight even more intensely in a nonprofit because they are more passionate about principle than they would be about money  
  * Compromises are harder at nonprofits

- Hansmen says that you are supposed to trust nonprofits because of non-distribution constraint, but he is only right to some degree

5. Effectiveness of the Nondistribution Constraint  
   1. Lucy, who lives in NY, wants to give money to help poor children in her hometown of Chicago. She finds out about a nonprofit called “Chicago Kids” or “CK,” studies their website, and confirms that their mission is to help low-income children in Chicago. She also confirms that “CK” is a nonprofit, and that the CEO’s name is Marvin, and the Board Chair’s name is Natalie. If CK runs a surplus, can Marvin and Natalie take it as a dividend?  
- No, nonprofits are barred from distributing profits  
- Hansmen: Nondistribution constraint builds the trust for her to donate even if she cannot monitor the services/goods herself

  2. Which of the following is true?  
     1. Natalie cannot be compensated as a board member of a nonprofit.  
- Not true – Possible. Some nonprofits do pay **board members**

  2. CK’s rent per square foot must be below the median rent in Chicago’s real estate market.  
- Not true – you can **get nice office space**

  3. Natalie cannot be Marvin’s childhood friend or his relative, since this sort of personal tie between a board chair and CEO would represent an impermissible conflict.  
- Not true – Marvin can **hire his relative**  
  4. Marvin cannot take 8 weeks of vacation every year.  
- Not true – Marvin can take **extended** **vacation**  
  5. Marvin cannot receive an 8% raise three years in a row.  
- Not true – Marvin can get a **raise every year**  
  6. Marvin cannot receive a bonus equal to 5% of the surplus that CK runs each year.  
- True – Marvin cannot take any of the surplus in the form of compensation because it looks like a dividend  
  * However, Marvin could set certain KPI and if these are achieved give bonuses as long as it is not tied to the surplus  
    * This works especially well with fundraisers – if they achieve X amount of fundraising then they will get X bonus  
    7. Marvin cannot hire his sister, Olivia, as his chief of staff.  
- Not true – Marvin can hire his relative  
  8. Marvin cannot dedicate 5% of CK’s budget to pay for him to attend conferences in Europe.  
- Not true – Marvin can use budget to **pay for conferences**  
  9. If Lucy calls the office at 9am or at 4pm on any given weekday, Marvin will usually be there.  
- Not true – Marvin **doesn’t need to work hard**

- **The nondistribution constraint only goes so far. You can’t take money blatantly, but you can spend it in ways that give yourself a personal benefit instead of progressing the mission**  
  * **Nondistribution can be exploited with agency costs**

  3. How reliable is the nondistribution constraint in keeping nonprofit managers and boards from skimping on quality or overcharging beneficiaries?  
- Only somewhat reliable but not completely  
    
6. Incentive Compensation – **Solution for VC but not for nonprofits**  
   1. What role does incentive compensation play in venture capital? Why?  
- Incentive compensation creates motivation for VC and Founder (low cash salary and big equity grant) to do well given the uncertainty and asymmetric information – need to make them monitor themselves by giving equity  
- Allows Founder to self-monitor to overcome information/incentive problems

  2. As a legal matter, can similar compensation be used at nonprofits?  
- No. There is a comparable degree of information problems without the paramount solution

  3. Can a nonprofit designate specific goals and reward employees for achieving them? Can those goals relate to the size of the surplus? Can they relate to progress in achieving the mission?  
- You cannot give a percentage of the surplus  
- But if the targets are mission related, you can give bouses to that (bring in X clients, raise X money)

  4. Why is compensation described in “c” potentially hard to implement?  
- Hard to measure the mission because you can’t use profitability  
  * Compensation tied to progress on the mission means that you need to measure progress on the mission, but this is hard to do  
  * And also can’t tie to surplus

  5. Peter is the new CEO of a for-profit hospital. Before the board hired him, the hospital’s profits were an unimpressive 4% of capital invested. The board wants the hospital to earn at least 8%.   
     1. How can the board motivate Peter to double the profits?  
- Compensation \= X  
  * 8% profit increase \= X \+ Y  
  * 10% profit increase \= X \+ Y \+ E

    2. What incentive does the board itself have to press Peter for better corporate performance?  
- Board is pressuring CEO and Board has incentive compensation of its own  
  * This is a key feature to overcome agency costs

    3. Do you think supervisors usually like to fire people? Or to eliminate perquisites that their colleagues like? Why do they do it?  
- They do not like to do but in a for-profit situation they have to do it to cut costs so that their compensation is higher  
  * **Agency Cost: Compassion of not firing is a personal benefit to you instead of doing what is best for the business**

  6. Quentin is the new CEO of a nonprofit hospital. Before the board hired him, the hospital was consistently losing money. The board wants the hospital to break even.   
     1. Can the board motivate Quentin in the same way that the for-profit hospital board is motivating Peter (in the last problem)?  
- No. Nondistribution constraint so no bonuses

  2. In a nonprofit, are there other reasons why professionals might be motivated to perform well, which are less likely in a for-profit firm?  
- Sometimes the way to eliminate temptation of managers to do something in their self-interest is by reminding the people why they are there – they care about the mission  
  * Note that this is not the nondistribution constraint at work but maybe it lays the groundwork to let this happen

- **Ideally, if nonprofits hire the right people, they will monitor themselves (just like incentive compensation in VC)**

  3. How do the incentives of nonprofit boards compare with those of a for-profit board?  
- Nonprofit boards are rarely paid. They do it because they also believe in a mission. This can make them take the responsibility seriously

  4. Do you think Quentin is more or less likely than Peter to fire people?  
- Less likely because without high-powered financial incentives, it is harder to motivate people  
- Argument some people make: To do good, we need to start by taking care of the people that work for us  
  * Counter: Beneficiaries come first

7. Agency Costs   
   1. Richard is the new CEO of a chain of for-profit restaurants in major cities across the U.S., and you are a member of his company’s board. Richard’s predecessor, Sally, was on the road half the time, visiting the restaurants and meeting with their managers. Sally’s motto as a manager was, “there’s no substitute for being there.” She believed that her periodic visits motivated the manager of each restaurant to work harder, and that her visits allowed her to share good ideas from one restaurant with others. Sally also loved traveling, and was proud of having elite “platinum” status at a number of airlines and hotels. On each trip, when the work day ended, she made plans with one of her many friends in each of the relevant cities. Richard is going to try a different approach. He is scheduling an individual video conference with each restaurant manager every two weeks, and a group video chat for everyone every two weeks as well. He plans to travel once a month to visit a restaurant “live,” and will visit each of the 36 locations every three years (instead of every year, as Sally did). As a board member, you are trying to evaluate whether Richard is right to make this change. What information can help you to make that judgment over time?  
- 2 Explanations for Sally:  
  * Business Reason: More effective monitoring by being there, meeting things  
  * Agency Cost Reason: Sally is getting a personal benefit – travel, platinum status  
- 2 Explanations for Richard:  
  * Business Reason: More frequently communicating with managers, saving the company money (even if video isn’t fully as good as in-person)  
  * Agency Cost Reason: Maybe he doesn’t want to travel that much

- Experiment of how Richard is doing it differently. Does this have an effect?  
  * **Look at profitability of restaurants and judge which strategy is right**


  2. Tina is the new CEO of a network of welfare centers and soup kitchens across the U.S., and you are a member of his nonprofit’s board. Tina’s predecessor, Ursula, was on the road half the time, visiting the welfare centers and meeting with their managers. Like Sally, Ursula’s motto as a manager was, “there’s no substitute for being there.” She believed that her periodic visits motivated the manager of each welfare center to work harder, and that her visits allowed her to share good ideas from one center with others. Like Sally, Urusla also loved traveling, accumulating frequent flier miles, and seeing friends in every city. Like Richard, Tina is going to try a different approach, relying more on video conferences and less on “live” visits. As a board member, you are trying to evaluate whether Tina is right to make this change. What information can help you to make that judgment over time? Is your job evaluating Tina’s judgment harder or easier or no different than the job of evaluating whether Richard is right in the last problem?  
- Same as above

- **Without revenue (something simple to measure), it will be harder to have the information and therefore harder to deal with incentive problems**  
  * People are smart enough to tell you the story that this is good for the job  
  * Information problems increase; Incentive problems increase


8. How to Save the World suggests ways to deal with incentive and information problems at nonprofits. Specifically, the book says that the best nonprofits are effective at two tasks.   
   1. What are these tasks?  
- **1\) Analysis: Successful businesses and nonprofits need to be analytical and rigorous in figuring out the best way to get the job done**  
  * **But having the knowledge is not enough**  
- **2\) Advocacy: Need to get the relevant people to believe in the plan and give it the effort it requires to do it the right way**

  2. The book also suggests synergies in these tasks–that is, working on each one can help a nonprofit make progress on the other. What are those synergies?  
- If you completed the analysis and picked a good method, the smart people you hired will ask you why are we doing it this way  
  * This analysis, if it’s good will persuade them too  
  * **The analysis is critical with advocacy to convince others of the plan. Need to demonstrate you thought it through**

- **Not enough to just have a good idea to get people on board. You need to convince them by making the analysis a collective endeavor**  
  * In addition to get them on board with the analysis, you need to let them in to the planning process to get their buy in  
  * This is necessary extra time to spend. You need the people doing it with you to believe in it. **You need to make people think that this is their idea too. This makes them feel like they have ownership over the idea to make it work**  
  * “If I’m doing my job correctly, then no one would ever think I had an idea of my own”

- **1\) Analysis prepares us to persuade others and hopefully persuades others too**  
  * **The collective endeavor can have others take ownership of the idea**  
- **2\) Advocacy because as people see problems in the analysis, they have buy in and are willing to help solve them**  
  * **The collective endeavor can make the idea itself better**

# 11: Nonprofits (Management as Response to Information and Incentive Problems)

- Management strategies as a solution to information and incentive problems  
- Planning process are helpful to:  
  * 1\) Focus on what the next things should be that you do; get feedback on this  
  * 2\) Opportunity to get people to agree with the strategy you are trying to develop because if they don’t agree they have incentive problem to not comply  
- Granular choices you can make during planning process and order of planning process can help get more buy in  
  * In theory, someone might want to just get everyone in a room to talk it through, but this doesn’t work  
  * Instead, must lay the groundwork for different people understand your arguments  
    * Start with the group that needs something from everyone else to master the details of the benefits you will get from taking budget/employees away from other groups  
    * But even before that, have a pre-conversation with the other groups who you will be taking from to give a general warning without giving details that there might be issues that might effect you  
      * Avoid the “why didn’t you tell me earlier”  
- You cannot be a part of every decision so you need to impact others’ decision making power by giving them criteria  
  * Help encourage them to think about an issue the way you would if you were consulted. Give them an approach that will help them get to the decision you would have come to  
- 3 Questions for Decision making criteria to allocate resources:  
  * 1\) How important is the problem?  
    * Can’t prove that it is the most important because that introduces comparisons that are conceptually hard to resolve but push people to show that it is important  
  * 2\) How effective is the response?  
    * Just because something is important doesn’t mean you should invest in it if you can’t move the needle with your resources  
      * **Want to know outcome (how effective is it) but can use output (what do we do) to gauge outcome because outcomes are harder to measure**  
        * Output \= How many people enrolled in job training program  
        * Outcome \= How many people went on to get better jobs  
  * 3\) Are we the right organization to do the job?

1. Review: To solve information and incentive problems—and, therefore, to be more effective in advancing their mission--what are the two goals nonprofits need to pursue?  
- 1\) Analysis: Figure out what you want to do  
- 2\) Advocacy: Coordinate people around you to accomplish goal

2. Planning  
   1. What is a planning process? Do you think it can help with either goal? With both goals?  
- Planning process can help with both goals:  
  * 1\) Figuring out what to do is the planning process  
    * Every organization has a planning process  
  * 2\) Planning can give you buy in through a collaborative process  
    * Planning processes regardless of if you know what is going to happen in the end (which path you will pick) are important to help others feel personally invested  
      * If people think that they helped come up with the idea, they will work harder  
    * Allocates responsibility around  
    * **Gets people’s input which makes them more invested, effectively targets motivating people. Collaborative process in key**  
    * Collaborative process negatives: Can lead to longer process, bad outcomes if others have bad ideas

  2. Why did JDC need a new planning process? What was the first step in launching it? Who was involved and why?  
- Schizer tried to get JDC to be more analytical to overcome its inertia  
- Just because you think you know doesn’t get you very far  
  * **To influence a big organization that you are leading (in a place where you won’t be in the room for every decision), influence the way people make decisions**  
- **Tried to get people to maximize social return (use scarce resources in best way) by implanting three decision making criteria:**  
  * **1\) How important is the problem we are addressing**  
  * **2\) How effective is the response**  
  * **3\) Are we the right organization to do it**  
    * Comparative advantage: Other organizations can address this better so we should use the resources to do something else

- **How did he get people to use these 3 criteria?**  
  * Not by announcing these criteria  
  * Instead, by having one on one conversations with every senior executive and encouraged them to talk about how they would make certain decisions. Once people were talking, he was able to listen but also pick out parts of what he heard that he liked (which is what he already thought) and make them think that his idea was their idea. Then sent document showing what he had heard but these were really his thoughts. Said that he needed their help, their buy in  
  * Came up with these three questions himself but each person felt personally invested in creating that framework. Then they were using the framework themselves and having colleagues use it when making decisions when he wasn’t in the room  
    * **Planning process gives you the opportunity to come up with the best thing but also to get buy in for it**

3. Adele is a new CEO of Community Center (CC), which hosts various cultural and athletic activities for members and also runs CC Academy, a private elementary school. Some of the largest donors (including board members) began their relationship with CC because they sent their children to CC Academy. Since CC Academy was launched 15 years ago, CC has subsidized its budget. But now CC Academy gets many applications, brings in significant tuition revenue, and also attracts a lot of philanthropic support. Bart, who is CCs chief planning officer, has told Adele that he thinks the subsidy should be discontinued, especially because CC is struggling a bit financially. In particular, the cultural activities department (“CCD”), whose lecture series and concerts are core to CC’s brand, are struggling financially.  
   1. Assume that Adele is persuaded by Bart’s claim that the best thing for CC overall is to phase out the subsidy for CC Academy and redirect funds to CCD. Since Adele is the CEO, can’t she just make this decision on her own? In answering the question, please highlight the importance of incentives and information.  
- As a formal matter, the CEO can make this decision  
- But the smart way to do it is to get people on board for it to be successful

  2. Is this an issue that would appropriately be addressed in CC’s annual planning process?  
- Yes. The planning process is supposed to help with different priorities across initiatives  
  * This is a quintessential planning process issue

  3. Carlo is Nonprofit’s head of fundraising. He hears about Bart’s idea to shift resources away from CC Academy, so he comes to see Adele. “You realize that most of our large donors now came to us through the school,” he says, “and that includes three-quarters of the board.” What concern is Carlo expressing? How can Adele use the planning process to address this concern?  
- He is concerned that if they made this shift they would lose donors which would lead to less money to the overall budget  
- Additionally, warns about your job. Board hires and fires CEO so don’t anger them

  4. To reallocate money from CC Academy to CCD, Adele wants to get buy-in from a number of people, including the head of CC Academy, the head of CCD, the head of fundraising, key donors, and the board. Who do you think she should start with and why? Is there a benefit of having separate meetings, instead of having everyone together at one meeting?  
- Inefficient to gather everyone at the same time because there will be fighting between groups  
- Need to start by generating support gradually across different groups  
- Could be a good idea if the CEO was pursuing the idea to expose deep divisions to stop the proposal  
  * Way of stopping something without saying “no”  
- Instead of bringing everyone together all at once, she could start with:  
  * Head of CC Academy: Need their buy in because they are most directly impacted  
  * Head of CCD: **Understand potential benefit of reallocating the money first. Meeting the person who will get the benefit will tell you what that benefit actually is.** This bolsters the case to Head of CC Academy because you can present to them what CC is going to lose if they do not cut CC Academy  
    * Morale issue with going to CCD: “Why am I only hearing about this now?”  
      * **Often, people understand the merits about what you are doing so they default to qualms with the process if they are unhappy about it**  
    * Addressing the morale issue: Go to CC Academy and Board first for **pre-conversation** (saying we are having problems with CCD and this could have implications beyond CCD. I wanted to share immediately this with you, but I don’t have further information yet)  
      * This takes their argument of why didn’t you tell us first away  
- **Order of the conversations matters (even if it seems inefficient). Creates efficiency in the long-run**

  5. True or false: **An effective planning process helps a nonprofit allocate resources where they are needed the most**.  
- True.

  6. True or false: **An effective planning process helps build support internally among a nonprofit’s professionals, the board, and the nonprofit’s donors**.  
- True.

4. Erin, who is the head of CCD, comes to see Adele. “You know how we have been trying for months to get Saylor Twift (a famous performer) to give a concert at CC,” Erin vents. “Well, it turns out that she came to sing to the kids at CC Academy.” When Adele is surprised, Erin explains that Saylor’s nephew is enrolled at CC Academy. Adele is frustrated that she, Erin, and the rest of the senior management did not know about this connection. “Once Saylor was coming,” Erin vents, “we could have asked her to give a concert for CCD. I can’t believe we missed this opportunity\!”  
   1.  Pam is the principal of CC Academy. Can you think of two reasons—one innocent, and one less so--why Pam might not have mentioned Saylor’s link to CC Academy or the concert to Erin and Adele? (Hint: one is an information problem, and the other is an incentive problem.) When confronted, which reason is Pam likely to give? Why?  
- Information Problem: Didn’t occur to me that it would be of interest to CCD. It happened last minute  
- Incentive Problem: Pam wanted to keep the event exclusive to CC Academy to keep the money/reputation boost for her part of the organization to herself  
  * Pam is likely to give the innocent information problem explanation

  2. What is a “silo” and why is it a problem?  
- **Silo \= People from different parts of an organization do not coordinate with each other**  
- It is a problem based on information and incentive problems:  
  * Information Problem \= No information exchanged between departments  
  * Incentive Problem \= Why should we help another department when it doesn’t help us  
- Should we eliminate departments to eliminate silos? No. Departments are created through **specialization which creates efficiency**  
- **Silos follow directly from the willingness to be on the good side of your department (you will be rewarded for working for/sharing information with your department but not others)**  
  * **Incentive problem that compounds an information problem**  
  * You won’t be rewarded for sharing the information, working, answering questions for other departments – only yours

  3. Adele consults a Mark, a management consultant, about silos. “How do I get people in different departments to share information with each other and work together?” Mark mentions something they do at his firm: “We require people to have a 15 minute conversation (assigned at random) every two weeks with someone who works in another part of the organization.”   
     1. What do you think is the rationale for this idea?  
- It gets the groups to work together

  2. What limitations (if any) do you see with this approach?  
- Fails to respond to people’s real incentives  
  * This will cost me time, cancel it, etc.

  4. The reading mentions “peer review.” What is it and why was it used in JDC’s planning process?  
- One department has to have proposals reviewed by person at the same level of another department  
- **If group A has plan vetted by group B head, group A’s plan will be improved**  
  * **Improves engagements between departments. People more invested in plan they were commenting on. And the person giving the comments can also learn about what the other group was doing and use that for their group**  
    * And then those people began forming task forces with colleagues from other groups  
      * This is equivalent to a 15 minute phone call but much more powerful because people chose to do it

- **Specialization creates information problems. Incentive problems compound them**  
  * **There are strategies you can use to overcome the incentive problems to get the information shared and get the proper expertise**


5. Recall that Bart is the head of CC’s fundraising. Erin and Pam each have innovative plans for the coming year.  
   1. Why is it important for Bart’s team to have current information about these plans, including the reason for launching these new initiatives, their goals, and the strategies for pursuing them?  
- **2 Reasons to give fundraisers the current information about new plans/goals:**  
  * 1\) Fundraisers can be more effective if they can speak in detail about what the organization wants to do and why the money is needed  
  * 2\) Fundraisers get measured by how much money they raise and if they don’t hear about new stuff organization is doing, they may be raising money for the old stuff that doesn’t help the organization

  2. Why might Bart’s team not have access to this information?  
- **Departments are in silos** so it is not common for department creating the plan to call the fundraisers right away to update them  
  * If the planner thinks that they will call the fundraising later, this is not going to work

  3. Can Adele use a planning process to help them get this information?  
- Yes. Good use of planning process  
  * Similar to a marketing team getting updated in a for-profit organization

6. Assume that Adele expects CC’s overall budget to increase by 3% next year.  
   1. Adele asks each of her direct reports to prepare a draft budget. She asks them to prepare three different scenarios. In one, they have a 1% increase over last year. In a second, their budget increases by 10%. In the third, their budget contracts by 5%. She asks them to attach a memo explaining the relevant changes in the second and third scenario. Why did they choose the increases and cuts that they are recommending? What information problem is this exercise seeking to address?  
- **Asymmetric Information Problem:** CEO has to make the decision but heads of departments have better information on the impact of the budget cuts  
- **Incentive Problem:** Heads of departments will not be incentivized to not share the proper information because they are worried that their budget will be cut

  2. A theme of this course is that sometimes an effort to solve an information problem creates a new incentive problem, and vice versa. What incentive problem can undercut the exercise in “a”? Put another way, how might a self-interested member of Adele’s team try to manipulate this process? What (if anything) can Adele do to address this issue?  
- Head of Departments may be strategic and try to minimize their chance of the cut by each saying that the cuts will crush their department (in the 10% decrease scenario)  
  * They will choose to cut the things they know the CEO most values in the proposal so CEO would not rationally do that  
  * **Embellishing the cut scenario in a way and give a dishonest answer so that it seems so bad that no rational person would choose that route**  
    * **So the exercise is only worth doing if you can get an honest answer**  
  * **But CEO could change the outcome of the exercise (and decrease the manipulation) by:**  
    * **Saying that they will hold the dept. head to whatever they are going to cut**  
    * **Or CEO can call out the person’s plan using humor**  
      * Use false humor: **“I know you might be tempted to tell me a false scenario…”**  
      * **Show them that you are on to them**: “If this is the thing you were going to cut, wouldn’t all these other bad ramifications come from this?”  
      * Ask for a different plan

  3. Ned, who is the head of CC’s board, calls Adele and says: “I am hearing some grumbling about the multiple budget scenarios. Some of your colleagues feel that their time is being wasted. I am not saying that I agree with this criticism, but I wanted you to know that it’s out there.” How do you answer him?  
- The person calling you probably agrees with or is the source of this criticism  
- Give the sincere answer of this is what I am doing and why I am doing it

7. *How to Save the World* suggests allocation resources based on three questions. What are these three questions supposed to help a nonprofit measure?  
- 1\) How important is the problem we are solving?  
- 2\) How effective is the response?  
- 3\) Are we the right organization to do it?

8. The first question  
   1. What is the first of the “three questions”?  
- How important is the problem we are solving?

  2. When Lee Goldman started as dean of Columbia Medical School in 2005, how important was the challenge of responding to pandemics? When he concluded his service in June of 2020, how important was this challenge? What is the general lesson here?  
- Not very important in 2005 but very important in 2020  
- General lesson is that the question can change. **You want your organization to hardwire something into its framework to evaluate “is the way we did things, what we should focus on now?”**  
  * **Planning process used the right way can do that**

  3. Is it more important to shelter the homeless or clean a polluted river? Why is this a hard question? If it’s not feasible to answer it, what suggestion does the reading make? What should nonprofits try to show instead?  
- **Since it is impossible for nonprofits to show what is more important, they should show what is important**  
- There is discipline involved in showing you are doing social good

  4. Helen is the CEO of Help\!, a humanitarian organization. She asks you to recommend whether to provide child care and medical care to children in Appalachia or in Westchester County (a suburb north of New York City)? What information do you need in order to answer the first question?  
- How many children are there?  
- Are there other organizations that can support each group?  
- What are the poverty rates?

- **You can’t evaluate whether feeding children is more or less important than cleaning a polluted river, but you can compare whether children in WV or children in Westchester need your services more**  
  * **The more focused the question is (comparing things that are more similar), the more applicable the data is to deciding where to allocate an organization’s resources (where you can do the most good)**

9. The second question   
   1. What is the second question?  
- How effective is the response

  2. What is the difference between an “output” and an “outcome”?  
- **Output \= What you did/service provided (Number of children vaccinated)**  
  * **Easier to measure**  
- **Outcome \= Social return (How children’s health improved)**  
  * **Harder to measure**  
  * **Ideally, you want to know the outcome (the impact)**

  3. To help children, Helen’s team at Help\! is deciding whether to invest in providing Covid vaccines. If they decide to provide vaccines, they will track the number of children vaccinated. Is this an output or an outcome? Assuming the vaccine works, how reliable a measure of social return do you think the number of vaccinations is? Why?  
- Usually measuring outputs is not a sophisticated strategy, but in some particular situations it is pretty good  
  * Measuring amount of meals (output) delivered to 1000 starving people will tell you a lot about the outcome as well  
- **If you are very confident in what you are doing is working and you can show that it is working, then outputs are good enough**  
  * If you know that the vaccine improves childrens’ health for a fact, and you distribute 1000 vaccines (output), that gives you a pretty good idea of what the social return will be (outcome)  
- **How effective the response is should be measured in outcomes. But sometimes measuring outputs alone if you know the product/service works is enough to get an idea of effectiveness**

  4. The reading uses the phrase “impact multiplier.” What does it mean?  
- Impact Multiplier \= Some steps that you take are especially effective because they lead to other good things

  5. If Help\! decides to vaccinate pediatricians instead, what “impact multiplier” would they seek to generate?  
- Doctors who can then treat other people  
  * Vaccine to a doctor is an impact multiplier because it does more good for the world than a vaccine to a lawyer

10. The third question   
    1. What is the third question?  
- Are we the right organization to do this? How do we compare with other organizations that might do it?  
  2. The mission of HerJustice is to provide legal services to underprivileged women who otherwise don’t have access to legal services. HerJustice does child support cases, but the organization does not represent clients in housing court who have been evicted. Why? Is the idea that deadbeat fathers are a more serious issue than eviction?  
- Trying to prevent mission creep (if you try to do too many things you won’t do any of them well  
- **There are already other organizations helping people in housing court so the incremental benefit that HerJustice can do in housing court is small (it just supplements the good work that others are doing). But because no one else is working on child support cases, or at least focusing on them, HerJustice can do particular good work in this area**  
  * **The question to ask when evaluating if you are the right organization to work on something is: “Do I have a comparative advantage?”**  
    * Is there an approach that I will take that is better than others? Do I have institutional characteristics that are unique?

  3. Legal Momentum also provides legal services to women. Two of their main initiatives are impact litigation and a helpline. Why?  
- They chose these initiatives because:  
  * **1\) Helpline can be valuable to people who have no idea where to go with their problems. Does general good in the world**  
  * **2\) Litigation sets important precedents that will change the law to benefit many people**  
  * **3\) To set important precedents, they need to find the right cases, which is another reason the helpline is important**  
    * **The Helpline and Impact Litigation complement each other well – synergy between services**

  4. In focusing on the well-being of children, Help\!’s professionals are quite concerned about the rhetoric of City’s mayor, where Help\! runs a number of programs. He has been inflaming tensions and arguing (without evidence) that low-income families are the source of crime, when in fact they often are the victims. Ed, who is a board member of Help\!, has urged Helen (the CEO) to make a public statement condemning the mayor. Why might Helen hesitate to make this statement? How (if it all) is this relevant to the third question?   
- Help\! is the wrong organization to make a statement about the mayor says because another organization that does advocacy instead of social services should make statement condemning the mayor  
- If they start taking political stances, Help\! may risk losing the local government’s cooperation  
  * Need to speak through the right forum to criticize political leaders. **Some organizations are designed to do this. Other organizations provide social services. You don’t want to interfere with the help to the vulnerable populations by mixing the missions**

# 12: Nonprofits (Disclosure as Response to Information and Incentive Problems)

1. Easterbrook & Fishel (“E\&F”) say that **fraud is inefficient**. What reasons do they give?  
- If investors do not know if something is true or not, they will invest time and resources to verify something. This is inefficient because it causes duplication of research (everyone is researching the same results)  
  * **The government can save everyone a lot of trouble by imposing a legal burden mandating that everyone speak accurately**  
  * A and B are considering an investment. A and B should work together to research the investment together to avoid duplication of effort  
  * **There is a lot of underinvestment because people just do not want to bother finding out more (they have finite time/resources to expend so they can’t spend it on everything and sometimes when they spend the time/resources they will get it wrong)**  
- Business owner has a comparative advantage (lowest cost provider) to get information over the investor  
- **A no-fraud rule helps to put the obligation to present information on the lowest cost provider of information, reducing duplicative effort and leading to better investments**

2. A central theme of this class is that information asymmetry can undermine mutually beneficial transactions. In principle, a solution to this problem is disclosure. But a key question is whether this disclosure be trusted. Let’s begin by assuming (incorrectly) that there is no ban on fraud, so we can explore whether disclosure would have any value.  
   1. Assume there are two firms: Competentco (CC) and Ineptco (IC). Does CC have the incentive to disclose information about itself? In doing so, does it have an incentive to do so in a way that is trustworthy?  
- The higher quality firms have incentive to share information and prove that they are higher quality, distinguishing themselves from the inept firms

  2. Does IC also have an incentive to disclose accurate information about itself?  
- Inept firms do not have an incentive to disclose accurate information about itself

  3. How do E\&F say that a high quality firm like CC can reassure potential investors that its information is accurate?  
- **If fraud is not illegal and disclosure is not required, investors have ways to tell that higher quality firms are better like checking dividends, third party certifications**

  4. Given your answers to “a,” “b” and “c,” might investors who are thinking of investing in either CC or IC have ways to tell which is higher quality, even if no disclosure is required and even if fraud is not illegal?  
- **Even if the law isn’t helping companies by requiring only factually accurate statements, investors and quality firms can take steps to demonstrate that they are better**

  5. Easterbrook & Fishel concede that a firm’s have only a limited ability to convince investors that their information is accurate. Why? (Hint: can a firm disclose everything? Do investors want to verify everything?)  
- **Transactions costs impose a limit on disclosure**  
  * **Firms cannot disclose everything and investors do not want to verify everything. This requires too much time/resources (transactions costs)**  
  * There will always be distrust and discounting between firms and investors

  6. Review: What role can investment bankers and accountants plan in this process?  
- Third party expert verification can increase trust  
  * There are steps even in a world where fraud is legal that investors could do to vet the firms

  7. Review: What role does incentive compensation play? Can nonprofits use this strategy?  
- Incentive compensation can align incentives to get both parties “skin in the game” and motivated towards the common goal of a better share price  
  * Nonprofits cannot use incentive compensation when it is tied to surplus 

3. E\&F say that a ban on fraud (without a requirement to disclose) can help reduce information asymmetry.  
- Intermediate Position: What if the government’s position was that firms were penalized for fraud but not required to disclose (not penalized for omissions)?

  1. In their view, without a ban on fraud, is information totally unreliable?  
- No, not totally unreliable  
- **Even when there is no ban on fraud and people have the legal ability to lie, there are mechanisms to look past some of that** 

  2. How does a ban on fraud help firms bridge information asymmetry?  
- **By penalizing deception, a fraud ban increases the credibility the quality firms have and decreases the advantage the inept firms have to mislead investors**  
  * **It is much better to not check everything yourself and ask questions where you can rely on the answers (check more things, spend less time)**

  3. E\&F say that a ban on fraud reduces the cost of signaling quality, but not to zero. Why doesn’t the rule eliminate these costs?  
- If you ask about the wrong thing then you might still get the wrong information  
  * No full disclosure requirement  
  * **Ban on fraud helps but doesn’t do everything**

  4. E\&F observe that a ban on fraud introduces costs of its own. What are these costs?  
- **Costs of ban on fraud:**  
  * **Enforcement and compliance costs to verify (legal fees)**  
  * **Chills market on putting out truthful but risky statements**

4. E\&F analyze what (if anything) a rule requiring disclosure adds to an anti-fraud rule.  
   1. Can a firm remain silent under both types of rules?  
- Yes, firm can still not volunteer some information 

  2. Is information a public good? If so, does this tell us anything about whether the right amount of information is produced?  
- **Information is a public good so sharing information can help a lot of people who didn’t pay for it**  
  * **This tells us that information will be underproduced because public goods cause free riding (others keep hoping that others will pay for it)**

  3. According to E\&F, why might too little information be produced? Why might too much be produced?  
- Too little information may be produced because the firms do not internalize all the benefits of producing  
- Too much information may be produced because the firms are legally required to disclose some irrelevant information

  4. Without a rule requiring disclosure, would a firm have the incentive to disclose good news?  
- Without a rule requiring disclosure, firm has incentive to disclose good news

  5. Without a rule requiring disclosure, why might a firm hesitate to disclose bad news?  
- Without a rule requiring disclosure, firm will hesitate to disclose bad news

  6. According to E\&F, if a firm always discloses good news, and decides to remain silent, how will investors interpret this silence?  
- If a firm always discloses good news and decides to remain silent, investors will interpret silence as negative (bad news)

  7. According to E\&F, given your answer to “f,” does a firm have a reason to disclose bad news?  
- Firms have an incentive to disclose bad news so that investors do not read deeply into the silence and think that the news is actually worse than it is

5. Later in their article, E\&F say the following: “**Imposition of a standard format and time of disclosure facilitates comparative use of what is disclosed and helps to create an efficient disclosure language. If every firm must disclose the same things, there will be reciprocal benefits to each firm's investors even though the firm will be compelled to disclose things of advantage to rivals**.”  
   1. What is a “network effect”? (This is not in the reading.)  
- **Network Effect \= Benefit of participation grows as the network expands**  
  * **The quality of a firm increases as more people are using (or more of a specific group of people are using it – your friends/family)**  
  * **The use of the firm improves its quality**  
  * If your friends all use the same product, you might be inclined to use that product too even if it is the worst quality one

  2. Are network effects when firms use the same format and definitions when disclosing information? Do these network effects offer a potential justification for mandatory disclosure?  
- The more companies that use the same standard will make it easier for investors to compare across companies  
- Companies themselves have more standardized goals when planning strategies for business operations

- **In theory, every company could decide how to disclose information in its own manner (and probably has incentive to disclose even bad news). But non-mandatory disclosure creates 2 problems:**  
  * **1\) Learning/Compliance Costs: Investors must invest time to understand how this particular firm does its disclosure**  
  * **2\) Comparisons are lost: Part of what you want with the disclosure is to compare information across firms**  
    * Comparisons are easier when there is a standard, mandatory format  
    * There are network effects about mandatory disclosure that create a standard format (even if this is not the best method of disclosure). Best disclosure might not be preferable if everyone is not doing it this way (no benefit of comparison)  
- **Network effects offer a justification for mandatory disclosure because firms are forced to disclose the way other firms are disclosing and this will lead to a standard format which lowers learning curves and makes for easier comparisons**  
  * Even though over standardization can make people overlook industry specific characteristics and evolutions

- E\&F are free market advocates – no mandatory disclosures. Their argument is that there are market dynamics that will encourage firms to behave as if disclosure is mandatory even when it is not  
  * Even if you have bad news, it is better to disclose so investors do not think it is worse than it is. And if it is the case that firms will share both good and bad information, maybe disclosure does not need to mandatory at all  
  * But they also recognize that mandatory disclosure has the benefit of people disclosing in a similar way which facilitates comparisons (network effect)  
  * But there is also a cost of mandatory disclosure if the mandatory way is not the best way (everyone stuck with inferior way of disclosing)

6. Adrian is the CEO of a nonprofit. Bob is her Chief Planning Officer, and Charlotte is the Chief Financial Officer. Bob and Charlotte would each like Adrian’s job. Adrian and Bob plan a new initiative, which does not go well. Diane is the donor who funded it. Adrian and Bob are deciding what to tell Diane about the unsuccessful experiment.  
   1. Could Adrian and Bob incur legal liability by saying, “The experiment was bold and really illuminating, and we couldn’t have done it without you”?  
- No, this is spin. They haven’t said it succeeded/failed – just that they couldn’t have done it without her

  2. What if instead Adrian and Bob say, “The experiment showed us how to deliver service just as effectively for only ½ the cost” when this is not accurate?  
- This is fraudulent. Inducing investor to provide money through misstatement

  3. Why might Adrian and Bob feel strongly that they need to tell the truth? Please offer reasons rooted in principle, as well as reasons rooted in self-interest.  
- Moral: Nonprofit might want to tell the truth because it is the right thing to do  
- Reputational: Nonprofit might want to tell the truth because if they are caught in a lie, they risk their future funding from this donor and others

  4. Why might Adrian and Bob be tempted to shade the truth, giving a more optimistic picture than is warranted?  
- They have a temptation to shade the truth to retain donors and keep the organization running 

  5. If Adrian and Bob do provide false or misleading information, please offer two reasons why Charlotte might tell Diane that she is being misled.  
- Moral: She wants to do the right thing  
- **Self-interested: Charlotte wants CEO job. She is focused on her own interest – not that of the organization’s**  
  * **This is an agency cost (incentive problem)**

  6. Even when nonprofit professionals and boards are tempted to offer misleading information, do they still have reasons not to do so?  
- **Asymmetric information problem: The donor knows less than the management team**  
  * **Agency cost hopes to address information asymmetry**  
- **They can spin and leave donor with the impression that this went well legally (without fraud), but it is unlikely to work because there are others in management that will tell donor the full story who are sharing this information out of (integrity or) self-interest**  
- Incentives interact in organizations in interesting ways – think about what others want to do to accurately predict results

  7. Assume that Adrian and Bob want the information they share to be more credible. They approach Ellen, a professor at the local university, asking her to provide an analysis, which they will disclose on their website. Why might this sort of expert opinion add value? Why might it not?  
- Expert opinion could add value because third party experts can increase the organization’s credibility  
- Expert opinion might not add value because the expert has incentive to slant their analysis to make the organization look good because they are hiring her  
  * **Third party analysis can be effective but is not always**

7. Your college roommate, Frank, is the CEO of an opera company. She has just launched two new productions, *A* and *B*. *A* has attracted a large audience (all productions sold out) visitors while *B* has attracted a disappointing audience (one-half of tickets unsold). Frank is thinking of posting the ticket sales on the nonprofit’s website, issuing press releases, and reporting these numbers to his board. Before deciding whether to do so, he calls you to ask for advice.  
   1. Do you think Frank should release the ticket sales for *A*? Will Frank be more or less enthusiastic about releasing the ticket sales for *B*?  
- He will want to release the sales for both because A is good news which could attract more donors/sponsors. But if he only releases A, people/donors will think that B sales are worse than it actually are  
  * People read bad news into the silence

  2. In light of your answer to “b,” what is the case for *never* releasing these numbers for any production? What is the case for *always* releasing these numbers for any production?  
- Never releasing information for any production is a possibility, but always releasing information no matter the result is a better approach because people will assume the bad news is worse than it is if you only release good news

8. Jane is president of a university, which has a broad curriculum. Jane considers climate change a major challenge, so she has cut funding for other departments, including the classics department, in order to launch a climate school. Jane is thinking of posting a document on the university’s website explaining the new strategy.  
   1. Kim is a successful entrepreneur who has supported the university generously. She was a classics major, and believes that her engagement with the classics had a major influence on her life and career. What are the advantages and disadvantages of highlighting the new strategy in writing, so Kim will know the details?  
- Advantages of Disclosure:  
  * Kim is not the only audience. Other donors who want the climate school may be excited about this prospect  
  * Kim might better understand the decision and get on board with it (although this is unlikely)  
  * Kim might respect the school’s honesty  
  * Kim and other donors might think the news of the departments getting cut is worse than it is if you do not disclose  
- Disadvantages of Disclosure:  
  * Kim and other donors who like the classics may want to donate less because they do not approve of the school’s  
- **There are tradeoffs with how much to disclose because you have to exchange disappointing some people for credibility**

  2. Jane is eager to motivate her team to do their best work. What are the advantages and disadvantages of describing the results from the first year in writing (e.g., number of students enrolled in the climate school, cuts in enrollment in classics and other programs) and posting this report online?  
- Advantages: May motivate the workers in the climate school and the donors who support this (and they may think it is worse than it is without disclosure)  
- Disadvantages: May discourage the workers in the classics department and other programs when they see their funding is being cut

  3. Len is the university’s most generous donor. He supports the pivot to climate, and he wants to know the results. Do you think he can get them, even if Jane doesn’t share them publicly?  
- Yes.

  4. Mary donates $500 per year to the university. She also supports the pivot to climate and wants to know the details. Do you think she can get them, even if Jane doesn’t share them publicly?  
- Probably not. She isn’t a significant enough donor to have say

  5. Nan runs a rating agency that evaluates universities. She has heard about the pivot to climate and wants to know how this initiative is doing. Do you think she can get them, even if Jane doesn’t share them publicly?  
- Probably not. Jane doesn’t want a third party reporter getting her hands on the information because then Jane cannot control the narrative as easily

  6. Why might it be a good idea (or a bad idea) for Jane to post the report she sends to Len online, making it available to anyone who is interested to learn more about the university’s work?  
- More disclosure is better. If it’s good 🡪 Good; If it’s bad 🡪 People might think it would be worse

9. Form 990  
   1. Does Form 990 require nonprofits to share information about the compensation of senior professionals and the board? About key governance issues, including whether they have conflict of interest policies? Does Form 990 require nonprofits to provide a financial statement, which reports different types of income and expenses?  
- Form 990 requires nonprofits to share information about senior officers, key governance issues, conflicts of interest, and financial statements which reports income and expenses

  2. Does Form 990 require nonprofits to share information about the impact and cost-effectiveness of their programs?  
- Form 990 does not require nonprofits to report the cost-effectiveness of their programs  
  * **Schizer: Not enough in nonprofits gets disclosed. We need to tell people if your programs are working. What matters is if the mission is succeeding**

10. Overhead ratios  
    1. What are overhead ratios?  
- **Overhead Ratio \= Nonprofit’s percentage of their budget that is spent on expenses/administrative costs/fundraising**  
  * CEO salary  
  * Fundraising  
  * Office

  2. Why do rating agencies use them to evaluate the quality of nonprofits? What is the argument for relying on them?  
- Rating agencies use overhead ratios to evaluate the quality of nonprofits because they can tell you how efficient the nonprofit is (defining efficiency by how much of the money is going to the mission as opposed to the fundraising/administration). They are also used because they are easy to calculate (especially because this information is available on Form 990\)

  3. What is the argument against relying on them?  
- **The problem with using overhead ratios is that administrative costs are expensive when you get good ones**  
  * A good CEO/management is critical and that costs money  
  * Increasing the overhead ratio is good if you are doing it in a productive way because this will make serving the mission better  
- **Additionally, people are inconsistent with how they classify an administrative/fundraising expense (this goes back to network effects and comparisons) so it makes it hard to compare overhead ratios accurately**  
  * You can call a fundraiser a “fundraiser” and count their salary in the overhead ratio or you can call a fundraiser an “educator” and count none of their salary towards overhead ratios  
    * Organizations try to manipulate overhead ratios constantly

- **Schizer: Problem with nonprofit reporting (on Form 990 and overhead ratios) is that this is the only data available so people have to use this to rate nonprofits, but it is misleading**

- **There are fundamental dynamics about disclosure – competing impulses about what to disclose and what not to disclose**  
  * **There is a function for mandatory disclosure rules but it is narrow. There are already market incentives to get firms to disclose to deal with asymmetric information and incentive problems. Given that disclosure is a standard mechanism to deal with information and incentive problems, institutions are already on their own motivated to disclose. However, they might disclose on their own in different or deceiving ways so there is a rationale to disclose in a particular way so that firms can facilitate comparisons and present accurate results**  
  * **At the same time, we do not want to require a one size fits all approach because this can be wrong or because it can not fit certain situations**

11. Penelope is the head of a humanitarian organization, which provides job training to single mothers. To track her organization’s progress, Penelope measures the income of clients before they enroll in the program and compares it with their income six months after they finish the program. Quincy is the head of Foundation, who is considering a grant to Penelope’s organization.  
    1. Quincy sends Penelope a draft gift agreement. It would require Penelope to do a survey asking people enrolled in training programs to describe how satisfied they are with the program, answering various questions about the quality of the teaching, materials, space, and the like on a scale of 1 to 10\. Penelope has not been asking these questions. She calls you and asks whether she should agree to these terms. What do you tell her?  
- Penelope should not agree to these terms because this information will be not useful to her. She is running the organization and knows best. She is measuring the organization’s success based on more important, outcome-driven information like the salaries, not output-driven granular information like the materials, etc.

  2. You are on the board of Quincy’s foundation. Assume that you know about the questions he has asked Penelope to answer, and that Penelope has asked not to answer them, proposing the alternative described above instead (comparing incomes). Quincy tells you that he still wants Penelope to answer his questions. “We ask all of our grantees to do this survey, and we then compare the scores.” Do you agree or disagree with Quincy on this?   
- I do not agree with Quincy on this. Penelope is using better evaluation information. However, I think Quincy’s strongest argument is that this information from Penelope will help him more easily compare her nonprofit to the others in deciding who to donate to. Although that makes it easier for Quincy to evaluate, it seems like a waste of Penelope’s time and resources

- **The people at the nonprofit know better about what they do than the donors, and they know if it is working**  
- **Nonprofits should disclose more information because they should be measuring these things themselves and if they are already measuring them, then just present it and donors will understand that you are already working on that**

# 13: Derivatives (Basics)

- 2 Kinds of Derivatives:  
  * 1\) Forward K \= Commitment to buy/sell underlying asset at a specified future moment and price  
    * Long \= Ownership (Bet on increase)  
    * Short \= Sale (Bet against increase)  
  * Forward (future) price always higher than spot (current) price because it is an interest rate, a loan from seller to buyer (buyer has ownership and exposure to asset because the price has already been set but seller doesn’t get money now)  
    * Current price is always the best indicator of what something is worth now and into the future  
    * Long person on forward K economically owns the property but does not need to pay for it yet  
  * 2\) Options:  
    * Call \= Option to buy  
      * Long a call option \= Option to buy if value of underlying is above exercise price (but if the value of the underlying falls below exercise price, I just lose premium and do not exercise the option)  
        * Do this because I think the value of the underlying asset will increase  
        * Buyer of call option pays a premium for choice to exercise or not  
      * Short a call option \= You sold someone the right to buy the underlying asset above the exercise price  
        * Seller of call option gets a premium for bearing the risk that the option will become valuable and they will honor commitment  
        * Do this because you think the value of the underlying asset will decrease  
    * Put \= Option to sell

- Long always means you think the underlying asset is going to increase in value and short means you think the underlying asset is going to decrease in value except in put options: If you buy a put option (option to sell) because you think the price is going down  
  * Technically if you buy a put option, you are long the put option, but you think the value is going down  
  * Similarly, if someone sells the put option, they short the put option, but they think the value is going up  
    * If A sells B a put option:  
      * B is long the put option (but thinks price is going down because he will get an option to sell if asset goes below exercise price)  
      * A is short the put option (but thinks price is going up because he will have to buy (be sold to from A) if asset goes below exercise price)

- Valuing Options:  
  * Black-Shoals 3 Factors:  
    * 1\) Time  
      * Longer is better   
    * 2\) Price of underlying  
      * Option to buy underlying at exercise price of $50 and the underlying is worth $5K, I am almost certain to use the option, so every dollar increase in the underlying’s price is a dollar increase in the value of my option  
      * Option to buy underlying at exercise price of $50 and the underlying is worth $2, I am almost certain to not use the option, so every dollar increase in the underlying’s price will only create pennies of value in my option  
      * The value of the underlying matters but how much it matters, depends on how likely the option is to be used  
    * 3\) Riskiness/Volatility  
      * Underlying asset has an expected value but how much the range of volatility might diverge from the expected price makes the option more valuable is the risk is higher because you are only getting the upside  
      * More risk means that the underlying asset’s value could go up or down a lot but with options you only get the upside

- Why buy forward K when you can buy options? Because you don’t have to pay premium  
  * Do you want to pay for downside protection?

  I.                ***Forward Contracts and Swaps***

1\. What is a derivative?

- A derivative is a contract with:  
  * Bilateral (2 Parties)  
  * Zero Sum (When one party makes money the other loses money). It is a bet  
  * Value derived from some other financial fact  
- **A derivative is a zero sum, bilateral K whose value derives from some other financial fact**  
  * Bet on value of something outside of the K: You can use a derivative to bet on the value of anything else (gold’s value, S\&P, interest rates)

2\. What is the difference between a “long” and “short” position?

- **Long \= You own something**  
  * Party betting on derivative to increase in value  
  * Betting the market will go up (most of the time)  
- **Short \= You owe something**  
  * Party betting on derivative to decrease in value  
  * Betting the market will go down (most of the time)

- To bet something is going to go up without owning it, you are long it  
- To bet something is going to go down without owning it, you short it  
  * Selling then buying a new share to replace it

3\. What is a forward?

- **Forward K \= Type of K to buy or to sell a specified underlying thing on a specified date in the future**  
  * The underlying could be anything

4\. Suppose the price of gold is $1,800 per ounce on June 1, 2022, and Debbie enters into the following contract.  She agrees that in two years (*i.e.*, June 1, 2024), she will buy one ounce of gold from Larry.  When she receives the gold in June of 2024, she will pay $1,900.  
A. Who is “long” under this contract?  Who is “short”?

- Debbie (buyer) is long. She owns something (the right to buy the ounce of gold)  
- Larry (seller) is short. He owes something (must sell the ounce of gold)

  B. If the price of gold in June of 2024 is $2,100 per ounce, what are Debbie’s economic consequences from entering into this contract?  What are Larry’s consequences?  (For simplicity’s sake, assume Larry did not own the gold upon entering into this contract; instead, he buys it in June of 2024, in order to deliver it to Debbie.)  
- Debbie makes $200. She paid $1900 for something worth $2100  
- Larry loses $200. He paid $2100 but only got $1,900  
  * Zero sum: The $200 Debbie makes is the $200 that Larry loses  
- To deliver the gold:  
  * Larry could do a **physical settlement:** Underlying property is actually delivered to settle the K (if Debbie was a jeweler)  
  * Larry could do a **cash settlement:** But if Debbie just wanted to make a bet on gold, Larry could settle the K by paying Debbie $200

  C. What if instead the price of gold in June 2024 is $1,500?

- Debbie pays Larry $400  
- Larry makes $400

  D. What would it mean for the parties to “cash settle” this contract?  How is that different from “physical settlement”?

- See above

5\. On the forward contract in the prior question, please note that Debbie does not have to pay the purchase price for two years. 

1. Why do you think the price is $1,900, even though the current market price is $1,800? Is the “forward” price higher than the “spot” price (the current market price) because the parties predict that the price will rise?

- Note: Forward price (price on K) is $1900 but spot price (current price) was $1800  
  * **Forward price \= Price on the derivative**  
  * **Spot price \= Current market price**  
- Forward price will almost always be higher than spot price  
  * Not because the market thinks that the price is going to go up  
    * If people think that people the price is going to go up, the price will go up  
    * The current price is the aggregate of everyone’s expectations of the future price  
- **Forward price is always higher than current price not because of a market prediction but because the seller is being compensated for payment in the future**  
  * Privilege of paying in the future is like the seller lending buyer money  
    * Interest (credit risk and time value of money)  
- **Increase in the price is due to interest buyer pays for not having to pay now**  
- **Forward price \= Spot price increased by relevant interest rate**

- **In pre-paid forward K, buyer pays now and delivery is in the future**  
  * **In a pre-paid forward K, forward price \= current price**  
  * No implicit loan from seller to buyer

2. What is “leverage”?  
- **Leverage \= Investing with borrowed money**  
  * Debbie’s forward K is completely leveraged  
- **Derivative is a 100 percent leveraged investment (immediate exposure, zero cash until performance)**  
- **The derivative transfers the economic exposure immediately (it is as if she owns the gold already)**  
  * **Debbie is exposed to the price of gold at the time of signing**

- Economically similar to a sale except with the dividends with stocks

3. Which is a more “leveraged” investment – buying the stock today, or entering into a forward contract to buy it at a fixed price in the future?

- **The forward K is a more leveraged investment than buying the stock today because you do not have to put the money up yet**  
  * **This is economically the same as borrowing the money of the entire purchase price of an underlying thing and buying the underlying thing**  
  * You can simulate the economics of a forward K by borrowing the money and buying the underlying thing

- **One reason to use derivatives:**  
  * **There are some situations where you cannot buy something with 100 percent borrowed money (margin rules of stock exchanges), but you can buy the derivative of that thing without borrowing the money**  
    * **Regulatory arbitrage: Economically similar things are treated differently**

- Note that in a pre-paid forward K on an asset that pays dividends:  
  * Buyer is essentially loaning the seller money and seller is keeping the dividends. This is factored into the purchase price

6\. Other derivatives share the same economic properties as a forward contract.

- Derivatives are the building blocks of transactions  
- **3 Types:**  
  * **Forward K**  
  * **Options**  
  * **Bonds**  
- **You can build any financial instrument with a collection of these 3 K’s**

1. What is a futures contract?

- **Futures K \= Type of forward K (purchase by one party, sale by another for specified underlying asset on a specified date) that is traded on an exchange**  
  * It is not negotiated between the parties  
  * **Certain parameters must be built into a forward K to qualify it for exchange trading**  
    * **Features of the K must be standardized (makes it fungible)**  
  * **A non-futures K (tailored just for you, more complex) is an over the counter derivative** 

2. What is a swap?  Are they “cash settled” or “physically settled”?  Are they settled all at once or periodically?  
- **Swap \= Cash settled forward K that is settled in part over time**  
  * Still betting on up or down of underlying asset but the bet gets settled periodically

3. Suppose Debbie and Larry want to change the above arrangement in two respects.  First, Larry will not make physical delivery of the gold.  Second, Debbie and Larry will not wait the whole two years (*i.e.*, until June of 2024\) to settle up their bet on the price of gold.  Instead, they want to make two one-year bets.  Suggest a derivative they can use to achieve this goal. What kind of derivative is this?

- **Swap K \= Series of cash settled forward K that are settled in payments one after the next (a bunch of forward K’s strung together)**  
  * 3 months: Debbie was right. Larry pays her $25  
  * 6 months: Debbie was right. Larry pays her $75  
  * 9 months: Debbie was wrong. Debbie pays Larry $200

- **Swap Characteristics:**  
  * **1\) Derivative (forward K)**  
  * **2\) Cash settled**  
  * **3\) Settled in a series of transactions**  
  * **4\) Once you place the bet you are fully exposed to price movements (unlike an option but like a forward K)**

  II.              ***Options***

7\. When an ounce of Gold is trading at $1,800 per ounce, Debbie pays Larry $40 for an option to buy gold from him at $1,850 at any time in the next year.  

A. What is Debbie’s option called?  Is Debbie’s option American or European style?

- American style option  
  * **This is a call option \= A right to buy at a specified price but not obligated to buy**  
    * Different than forward K because she can buy at a specified price if she wants to but is not obligated to do so  
    * **She is paying for the right to buy – not necessarily owning the underlying thing yet**  
    * She owns a long call option

  B. What is Larry’s position called?  What is the term for the payment he receives?

- **Larry has sold/written/granted a call option**  
  * **He gets a payment for giving the buyer the right to purchase at a specified price. This is the premium for giving her the right to buy**  
  * This is a short call

4. What is the economic result for Debbie and Larry if Gold is trading at $1,950 in one year?  
- Debbie \= $60 gain  
  * Will exercise the option  
  * **She does not make $100 profit (you must account for the premium she had to pay at the outset)**  
  * If you buy a call you think the price will go up by more than what the premium you paid i

- Larry \= $60 loss  
  * $40 for selling the call; $100 loss for option exercised  
  * **He would’ve made money if the price went down or not up by more than $40**  
  * If you sell a call you think the price is going to go down by more than what the premium you got is

5. What is the economic result for Debbie and Larry if Gold is trading at $1,750 in one year?  
- Debbie \= Loses the $40 premium but nothing beyond that. She will not exercise the option  
  * She would just buy it in the market for the new current price

- Larry \= Gets the $40 premium but nothing beyond that  
  * Debbie won’t exercise the option

6. How would your answer change if, instead of buying an option, Debbie had entered into a forward contract to buy an ounce of gold from Larry at $1,850 in one year? (Review: Why would the forward price be $1,850, even though the current price is $1,800?)  
- With a forward K, she would lose $100 because she would be obligated to buy at the new $1750 price (but she paid $1850 for the forward K)  
- **The benefit of using a call option instead of a forward K is that she has the choice to buy or not. This limits her loss to the premium she pays for the option**

8\. Assume that Larry believes the price of gold is going to decline below its current $1,800 level.  What option should he buy from Debbie (assuming she is willing to sell it)?

- He can sell a call option and make money off of the premium  
- **He can buy a put option which gives him the right to sell gold at specified price**  
- If the price declines, then he can sell at a higher price than the new price and make money off of the difference  
  * If the price goes from $1800 to $1000, Larry exercises his put option and sells something worth $1000 but gets $1800 ($800 benefit)

- **If there is no doubt, use the forward K (and avoiding paying a premium)**  
- **If there is doubt and you want to limit losses to the amount of the premium, use the option (and pay the premium)**

9\. Assume that Debbie wants to enter into a forward contract to buy 1 ounce of Gold from Larry for $1,850 in one year.  Instead of using a forward contract, can she achieve the same economic result with one or more option transactions?  In other words, how can you synthesize a forward contract with options?

- **Simulate a forward K with options:**  
  * **Buy a call option at forward price 🡪 Exposure to price increases**  
    * **Debbie will exercise call option if price increases and pays premium**  
  * **Sell a put option at forward price 🡪 Exposure to price decreases**  
    * **Buyer will exercise put option if price decreases (Debbie must sell) and gets premium**

- **If I buy gold for $1850 market price:**  
  * **Price goes up to $2000, I benefit $150**  
  * **Price goes down to $1700, I lose $150**  
- **In long forward K for $1850:**  
  * **Price goes up to $2000, I benefit $150 (I spent $1850 on something worth $2000)**  
  * **Price goes down to $1700, I lose $150 (I spent $1850 on something worth $1700)**  
- **Options:**  
  * **I buy a (long) call option for $1850 and pay $10 premium (gives me right to buy at $1850)**  
    * **Price goes up to $2000, I exercise option and benefit $150 (I buy something worth $2000 for $1850) and lose my $10 premium**  
    * **Price goes down to $1700, I do not exercise and lose my $10 premium**  
  * **I sell a (short) put option for $1850 and get $10 premium (gives buyer right to sell to me at $1850)**  
    * **Price goes up to $2000, buyer does not exercise, and I keep my $10 premium (I would pay buyer $1850 for something worth $2000 – buyer is not going to sell me something for $1850 when he can sell for $2000 in market)**  
    * **Price goes down to $1700, buyer exercises and I lose $150 and keep my $10 premium (I pay buyer $1850 for something worth $1700 – buyer is going to sell me something for $1850 worth $1700)**  
  * Economically, buying a call option and selling a put option are both bets that the value of the underlying thing will go in the same direction  
    * Buy long call option \= Participate in appreciation as price goes up  
    * Sell short put option \= Participate in decrease as price goes down  
      * Put these two together \= Forward K

- The premiums will wash out when the price on the option (the price you exercise at) is the forward price. If not, one of the options will be more expensive than the other and the forward K will not perfectly be replicated  
- Derivatives that do not set a price are waiting on the market price at the time of exercising

10\. Rank from most leveraged to least leveraged: a) a direct investment in gold; b) a forward contract to buy gold; and c) a call option to buy gold.

- Least Leveraged: Direct investment (must provide purchase price in cash)  
- Middle Leveraged: Call option to buy gold (must pay premium)  
- Most Leveraged: Forward K (not payment required)  
  * No premiums/out of pocket costs with a forward K. Just a K

11\. Assume that Debbie believes the price of gold will rise from $1,800 to $2,000 – but will go no higher.  She wants to make a profit on this prediction, but she wants to minimize her risk of being wrong, and she wants to pay as little money as possible to place this bet.  How can she do it? (Hint \-- she buys one option and sells another.)

- Debbie could just buy the gold at $1,800 and if it appreciates, she benefits from $200 increase  
  * But then she also gets exposure above $2,000 but she doesn’t value this additional exposure

- Instead, she should:  
  * **1\) Buy call option at $1800: Gets exposure from $1800 up and pays premium for this exposure**  
    * If gold goes up from $1800, she can exercise and buy it for $1800  
      * Focusing only on upside and downside doesn’t impact her  
  * **2\) Sell call option at $2000: Not exposed to appreciation over $2000 and gets premium for selling this exposure**  
    * If gold goes up over $2000, buyer can exercise and buy it for $2000 from her  
      * Focusing only on upside but limits amount of upside  
    * Through the second option, she has transferred the exposure above $2,000 for a premium (she gets money for selling the exposure)  
    * The premium allows her to reduce the amount of money she invest to place the bet  
      * **Net premium becomes smaller because she sold the $2000 call option for a premium which makes the premium she has to pay for the $1800 call option less**  
    * **Call spread \= Way of betting on asset will go up but not above a certain level**

  * Why not just buy at $1,800 and sell at $2,000?  
    * Buying the actual underlying asset requires more capital and requires you to monitor the market in a way so that you know the exact moment to sell. Just accumulate various financial positions together to get the precise exposure that you want

- **Derivatives are better because they allow you to make a much more precise bet**

12\. When the price of gold is $1,800, Larry will charge Debbie $40 for an option to buy gold at $1,850 at any time in the next year.  Will he increase or decrease the price, if the option changes as follows?  Why?

- Black-Shoals Formula: Values options  
  * Underpins the derivatives market to actually value derivates/options  
- Changes in economic terms make options more or less valuable

1. Debbie is allowed to use the option at any time in the next three years.  
- **More time on call option is more valuable (because it gives option more time for the option to go up)**

2. The price of gold falls to $1,799.   Will the price of the option change by more or less than a dollar?  Alternatively, what if the price rises to $1,801?  
- Yes. Because even if you don’t reach $1,850 where exercising the option makes sense, the change in price makes the probability the option will be exercised at $1850 more or less likely

- **If the price of the underlying asset changes, this impacts the value of the option regardless of if the option is at the exercise price because it makes it more or less likely that the option will be exercised**

- **If the price falls by $1, the option does not change by $1 always**  
  * The correlation of the underlying to the option is depends on how likely the option is to be exercised. If it is certain to be exercised, it is a dollar for dollar move. If it is certain not to be exercised, it will not move that much

- **2 Factors Impact Value of the Option:**  
  * **1\) Time (more time means more value)**  
  * **2\) Value of the underlying and its relation to the price on the option (did the value of the asset move in the direction of you exercising your option? 🡪 More value)**  
  * **3\) Riskiness of the underlying (riskier, more volatile underlying asset means more value)**

13\. Debbie and Mimi have different predictions about the price of gold in one year.  Debbie believes there is a 50% chance that Gold will trade at $1,900, and a 50% chance that it will trade at $1,700.  In contrast, Mimi believes there is a 50% chance that Gold will trade at $2,300 and a 50% chance that gold will trade at $1,300. 

1. Who will be willing to pay more for gold today – or would they both pay the same price?

- They would both pay the same price for gold today because the expected value is the same \= $1,800  
  * **Expected value \= Midpoint, the average of the expected outcomes**

- Debbie:  
  * 50%($1,900) \= $950  
  * 50%($1,700) \= $850  
  * Expected Value \= $1800  
- Mimi:  
  * 50%($2,300) \= $1150  
  * 50%($1,300) \= $650  
  * Expected Value \= $1800

2. Who would be willing to pay more for a call option to buy gold at $1,800 – or would they both pay the same price?

- Mimi would pay more for a call option because she has a higher upside

- When you are buying an option, you don’t care about the downside anymore  
  * **Call option allows you to only focus on the upside and so for Mimi the upside is more attractive (worth more) so the option is worth more**

- **Riskiness of the option: Two investors who have the same expected value, can have a different risk assessment (Mimi has more variability)**  
  * Debbie’s expected value of gold is $1800 but the range of what it might be worth is narrow  
  * Mimi’s expected value of gold is $1800 but the range of what it might be worth is wide

- 3 Variables that Influence the Value of an Option:  
  * 1\) Time (longer is better)  
  * 2\) Value of the underlying (higher is better for call option)  
  * 3\) Riskiness (riskier means more value because option only gives you half of the price distribution)

- **With any option, your return comes from a change in price**

# 14: Derivatives (Hedging and Tax)

I.      ***Hedging***

1\. What is the difference between hedging and speculation?

- **Hedging \= You are already exposed to a risk that you can want to get rid of**  
  * You can get rid of the risk by using a hedging transaction, a targeted strategy to transfer specific risk you do not want  
- **Speculation \= You do not yet have the risk but you want to get that risk**  
  * There is a bet out there that you want

- **Derivatives can be used to take on risk or transfer risk to someone else**

2\. Issuer, a corporation, needs to borrow money for two years.  If it issued a typical fixed rate debt instrument, Issuer would pay a coupon of 6% every year.  Instead, Issuer offers something a bit fancier. Investors pay $100, and receive their $100 back after two years. In addition, instead of receiving $6 of interest each year, the interest they receive varies, depending on the level of hurricane damage in Fort Lauderdale, Florida during that year.  Specifically, if the dollar value of the hurricane damage (as measured by a federal agency) is less than $1 billion, the Issuer pays $12.  But if the dollar value of the hurricane exceeds $1 billion, the Issuer pays no coupon for that year.  

A. Why might an investor want to buy this kind of bond?

- This is a CAT (catastrophe) bond is a type of contingent bond. It is a type of derivative (value derives from underlying asset)

- Speculation: Investor may want to buy this bond because this bond provides diversification because the payment is from weather changes, not financial market changes  
  * **Company specific risk** is bad. Diversification is important because you can reduce exposure to one company. So invest in index fund  
  * **Market specific risk** is also bad. When you invest in an index fund, there is still market-specific risk because you are still subject to general economic trends impacting the entire financial market  
    * You still have market risk when you diversify by buying international index funds because there are economic shocks that impact the global economy (trade war)  
    * There are limits to diversification. You cannot diversify away market specific risk with index funds  
  * **But you can buy a CAT bond that does not track the financial markets. This is an investment that does not correlate with overall market conditions and diversify away your market specific risk**  
    * (May correlate a little with U.S. financial markets if FL is hit hard by hurricane, U.S. economy may take a hit too)  
- **Derivatives can enable you to take specific kinds of risks that you might want that are not otherwise available**  
  * **This is a new kind of risk (speculation) that does not correlate with the market**

- CAT bond is subject to interest rate risk because if you fix the rate then interest rates may change with changes to the market economy  
  * To solve this, you would need to get a CAT bond with a variable interest rate that tracks the changes in the market

  B. Why might an issuer want to raise money with this bond, instead of a more traditional one?  Do you expect that this bond would be an especially attractive source of funding for issuers in a particular business?

- Hedge: Issuer might want to raise the money this way if they are an insurance company  
  * If insurance company sold insurance to lots of FL businesses/homes:  
    * No hurricane damage: Insurance company keeps the premiums from those businesses/homes and doesn’t have to pay  
    * A lot of hurricane damage: Insurance company has to pay out many claims  
  * Insurance company can structure borrowing so that they:  
    * No hurricane damage: Pay out high interest on notes when they do not have to pay out claims  
    * A lot of hurricane damage: Pay no interest on notes when they have to pay out a lot on claims  
  * **CAT bond transfers the weather-related risk from insurance company to investors**

- In this example:  
  * Investor \= Speculator  
    * **Derivative helps investor diversify further to shed market specific risk**   
  * Issuer \= Hedging  
    * **Derivative helps business owner who does not like a risk he is exposed to pass on some of it**

- Hotels may also buy these kind of CAT bonds to transfer some of their weather-related risk  
  * Not as common

- Credit risk on CAT bonds:  
  * The issuer (insurance company) may have to pay additional premium to borrower (investor) because the borrower is also taking on credit risk of the insurance company going under and not being able to pay. Or use credit default swaps:  
    * Credit Default Swaps \= Another financial institution will say even if they can’t pay, we will  
      * This is another derivative that is underpinning the CAT bonds to get shed the credit risk of the issuer from the investor to the new financial institution

- Another strategy to protect from market specific risk: Long-Short Funds  
  * These firms try to outperform the market in both directions. Making portfolio that protects you both if market goes up and if market goes down  
  * One of the challenges: Your total return will be smaller because one part of your portfolio will be going in the wrong direction

- Gaming Laws: You cannot tie a derivative to any underlying bet/asset  
  * Outcomes of a pro sports game 🡪 Blocked by gaming laws  
  * Weather conditions are financial (that’s why CAT bonds work)

3\. Jane makes fine jewelry for sale over the Internet.  Her father taught her the trade, and her “value added” is that of an artist.  She has an eye for beauty, and can turn molten metal into works of art.  But Jane has never liked the business world and, in particular, she has no idea which way the price of gold will go.  Her problem is that gold and other precious metals are essential ingredients, and they make her profit margin hard to predict.  What should Jane do?

- Business owner is exposed to a risk she does not want to be exposed to  
  * She could change pricing to remain steady despite fluctuations in price of gold  
- **But instead, she should hedge through a derivative**  
  * **What is the problem for Jane? Increases in price**  
  * **1\) She could buy a call option in gold**  
    * **If the price of gold increases 🡪 She can exercise her option**  
      * **She makes money on the option**  
      * **She loses money on the profit margins of her jewelry**  
    * **If the price of gold decreases 🡪 She does not exercise her option**  
      * **She loses on the option**  
      * **She makes money on the profit margins of her jewelry**  
  * **2\) She could enter into a forward K to buy gold (she could make exercise price her average gold price for jewelry or spot price if that is a good price for her business)**  
    * **If the price of gold increases**  
      * **She makes money on the forward K (She will pay less for something worth more)**  
      * **She loses on her jewelry profit margins (costing her more to make jewelry)**  
    * **If the price of gold deceases**  
      * **She loses on the forward K (She will pay more for something worth less)**  
      * **She makes money on her jewelry profit margins (costing her less to make jewelry)**

- She can use the derivative to transfer the precious metal risk to the counterparty on the K that wants it

4\.  Oilco has a new well that its geologists believe is very promising.  If Oilco invests $34 million now, it will be able to bring 1 million barrels of oil to market in one year – something that would be profitable at today’s $65 per barrel price of oil.  Yet Oilco is worried that the price of oil might decline below $65.  Indeed, Oilco is considering abandoning the project as too risky, given the volatility in the spot oil markets.  

1. Suggest various solutions to this problem.

- **Oilco is a business that is exposed to a risk they do not want**  
- **What is the problem for Oilco? Decreases in price**  
  * **1\) Oilco sells a forward K on oil at exercise price of $65**  
    * **If price of oil increases**  
      * **Oilco loses money on the derivative forward K (Oilco has to let someone buy – Oilco sells – something worth more at a lower price)**  
      * **Oilco makes money on their oil reserve investment (Oilco charges more in the market for their newfound oil than the market price when they found the well)**  
    * **If price of oil decreases**  
      * **Oilco makes money on the derivative forward K (Someone buys something from Oilco – Oilco sells – something worth less at a higher price)**  
      * **Oilco loses money on their oil reserve investment (Oilco charges less in the market for their newfound oil than the market price when they found the well)**  
  * **2\) Oilco can buy a put option at $65 current oil price**  
    * **If price of oil increases ($80)**  
      * **Oilco loses money on the put option premium (Oilco has right to sell oil worth $80 for $65. They won’t do this)**  
      * **Oilco makes money on their oil reserve investment (Oilco charges more in the market for their newfound oil than the market price when they found the well)**  
    * **If price of oil decreases ($50)**  
      * **Oilco makes money the put option (Oilco has the right to sell oil worth $50 for $65)**  
      * **Oilco loses money on their oil reserve investment (Oilco charges less in the market for their newfound oil than the market price when they found the well)**

2. You are a diversified shareholder of Oilco, which is a public company.  Why might you oppose the use of derivatives by management to hedge the above risk?  Why might you favor such hedging?

- Shareholder might (like this exposure) and not like the derivative hedging because a diversified shareholder will not be tied to the risk in fluctuation in price of oil like Oilco is. Therefore, the extra transactions costs associated with hedging are just a drag on the diversified shareholder’s portfolio  
  * Oil prices decrease means that this shareholder’s stock in Oilco decreases but his stock in another company he owns like an airline or hotel increases  
  * **If this is the case, why do companies hedge?**  
    * **Agency Cost – Shareholder is diversified and doesn’t need the derivative but management has more at stake in the success of this company (jobs, more options, stock) so they will want to decrease the risk**  
- **Defending Hedging (Response to Asymmetric Information): Shareholder might (not like this exposure) and like derivative hedging because the most efficient way to do get the money to finance high-value projects for the company is to stabilize the company’s cashflows internally (not borrow from an outside lender who does not have the information that the company has about the project so will be more risk averse)**  
  * **And then if you need additional financing, lenders will be more willing to lend to you if you have stable cashflows**  
  * Getting loans to finance the new well from financial institutions is harder for the oil company because oil company has the best information about whether to proceed

- Hedging is about businessowners shedding risk they do not want  
- They want to transfer this risk to another party  
- Is that worthwhile if companies are owned by diversified SH?  
  * No. Hedging is just a transactions cost to make management secure their jobs (Agency Cost)  
  * Yes. Management has access to information about promising projects that will be hard to communicate credibly how good these projects are to lenders because of asymmetric information. So better to not depend on outside funding or at least show lenders that your cashflows are stable to get capital more easily. This makes the company more money (even maybe lowering transactions costs to lenders) and makes shareholders more money  
    * Managers are trying to solve a (information asymmetry) problem for the shareholders

- Common Ownership diversification: If an oil company buys an airline, then increase in oil price helps oil company and hurts airline and visa versa  
  * Problem: Is management that is skilled at running an oil company going to be as skilled at running an airline

  II. ***Tax Deferral*** 

5\. Assume that interest rates are 10%. (This obviously is not the case, but it’s helpful to use round numbers.) What is it worth if someone lends you $100 for a year and charges you no interest?

- $10  
  * Interest-free loan is worth what you would have paid in interest

6\. If you have to pay someone $100 in one year, and interest rates are 10%, how much do you have to set aside now in order to pay $100 in one year?  This amount is called the present value of your obligation.

- $91  
  * By pushing a payment into the future you reduce its cost

7\. Assume interest rates are 10%, and that you owe $100 of tax this year.  If you are able to pay the tax next year instead (and don’t have to pay any interest in putting off your tax), do you save any money by delaying the tax?  If so, how much?

- Yes. Deferral is a way to reduce the present value of the payment

8\. True or false: **By delaying (or “deferring”) your tax, you reduce its present value**.

- True.

9\. To see an example of basic tax planning, you will need to know the following four rules:

**A.  If you make money on a derivative, you have to pay tax on the amount of your profit.  Let’s assume you make $1000 and the tax rate is 50%.  You keep $500 and the government receives $500.** 

**B. 	If you lose money on a derivative, you can use the loss to reduce your tax bill.  This means the government will also lose money when you lose money.  If you lose $1000 and the tax rate is 50%, you lose $500 and the government loses $500 (because you pay $500 less in taxes).**

- Government shares in your gains and your losses  
- The government’s share is determined by the tax rate

  **C.  Assume that you don’t have to pay tax (and cannot claim a loss) until you settle the derivative.  That can happen when the derivative reaches its “maturity date (so that it is scheduled to expire), or it can happen you can choose to settle it early.**

- No tax until I am done with the derivative means that I can control the timing of when I pay tax

4. **Finally, assume that you compute how much tax you owe every year.  Money you earn before midnight on December 31 is taxed this year, while money earned after midnight is taxed next year.**

10\. Ellen earns $100,000 each year in her job and pays a 50% tax on what she earns, so that she ends up keeping only $50,000. She would like to keep more of her money.  So she tries the following tax planning strategy, which is called a “straddle.”  She enters into a forward contract to buy an amount of a commodity (“Commodity”) on January 1, 2026 for $100,000 (“the long forward”).  At the same time, she enters into a second forward contract, obligating her to sell exactly the same amount of Commodity on January 1, 2026 for $100,000 (“the short forward”). 

A. Can she make any money on these contracts?  For example, let’s say Commodity is worth $120,000 on January 1, 2026\.  How much money does she earn (pretax) on the long?  How much does she lose (pretax) on the short?  What is the effect of the two together?

- She cannot make any money on these derivatives because they are perfectly offsetting. Any money that one of these K’s makes, the other loses the same amount at the same time  
  * She earns $20K on the long K  
  * She loses $20K on the short K

  B. Let’s say Commodity is worth $70,000 on January 1, 2026\.  How much money does she lose (pretax) on the long forward?  How much does she earn (pretax) on the short forward?  What is the effect of the two together?

- No effect economically regardless of which way the price of Commodity goes  
  * She loses $30K on the long K  
  * She earned $30K on the short K

  C.  Assume that Commodity prices are $120,000 at 11:59pm on December 31, 2025, so Ellen cancels her short contract, and pays $20,000 to settle it a day early (on December 31).  Then at 12:01am on January 1, 2026, she cancels the long contract, receiving $20,000.  When you look at both the long and the short forwards combined, how much money (pretax) has she earned or lost?

- Ellen lost $20K on the short K  
- Ellen made $20K on the long K  
  * **Combined, Ellen made $0 pretax**

  D. Remember that Ellen can subtract her losses from her taxable income.  In 2025, she earned $100,000 in her job, but lost $20,000 in cancelling her short forward (a day early on December 31).  What is her taxable income?  If she pays a 50% tax, how much tax does she owe?  If instead she earned $100,000 and had no losses on derivatives, how much would her taxable income be and how much tax would she pay?  How much (if any) tax does she save in 2025 by entering into this straddle?

- 2025  
  * Gross Income \= $100K  
  * She deducts a $20K loss  
  * Taxable Income \= $80K  
  * After-Tax Income \= $40K  
    * **The $20K loss inclusion saved her $10K in taxes**  
- 2026  
  * Gross Income \= $100K  
  * She includes a $20K gain  
  * Taxable Income \= $120K  
  * After-Tax Income \= $60K  
    * **The $20K gain inclusion added $10K to her taxes but it deferred that $10K one year**

- **By using derivatives to make two perfectly offsetting K’s and settling the loser this year and the winner immediately after the start of the next year, she is deferring her tax which is lowering its present value**

- **You can also just keep deferring every year by using the same strategy and constantly pushing off the tax**

11\. Below are excerpts from Section 1092 of the Internal Revenue Code. Please read the excerpts and answer the questions below:

	1092**(a)Recognition of loss in case of straddles, etc.**

		**1)Limitation on recognition of loss**

A. Is Ellen’s transaction a straddle?

- Eligibility:  
  * Yes. A straddle is having offsetting positions of personal property

  B. If it is, what is the effect of Section 1092?

- **Consequences:**  
  * **If you have loss on a straddle, you must wait for the gain on a straddle to take the loss**  
  * **You can only take the loss with the gain 🡪 Matching the timing**

- **Commercial Uses of Derivatives:**  
  * **1\) Hedging (pass on risk in a precise way)**  
  * **2\) Speculation (packaging a risk you want in a precise way)**  
  * **3\) Tax planning**  
    * **Because derivatives are so precise and calibrated, they are useful in tax planning because you can see what the rule says and do something economically similar through derivatives that avoids the rule**

# 15: Negotiations

Avery Katz Lecture:

- Deals and Negotiation:  
  * Deals \= Substance  
    * Why do contracts/organizations look the way they do?  
    * What terms and organizational structures create the most joint surplus?  
    * What do optimal terms look like?  
  * Negotiation \= Process  
    * How do the deals get in place?  
    * You have some but not all of the information  
    * You have a choice to share information or not  
    * Why do parties agree to suboptimal terms?

- Brookside Negotiation:  
  * What was the source of this conflict?  
    * Black: Should have charged a premium or did more DD to know they were bankrupt  
    * Lawyers: We would have spotted this. How do you persuade clients to keep you in the loop  
      * Part of your job to negotiate your client’s attention and interest  
      * You can always spend more at the front end to save on the back end  
  * How did it go?  
    * Anchoring too high is a problem when you don’t have all the information you want because it can ruin your credibility  
  * Bulwarism: Negotiating approach  
    * Pick a fair offer and present it and refuse to move  
    * Reasons this fails:  
      * 1\) You learn in the negotiation  
      * 2\) Ignores the human element and process. Humans like it when there is give and take

- Structure of Negotiation  
  * ZOPA  
  * BATNA

- Building Blocks:  
  * Power: Ability to bring about particular outcomes (usually that the other party doesn’t like)  
  * Rights: Independent standards of perceived legitimacy or fairness (“You promised”)  
  * Single most critical distinction:  
    * Positions: Demands, claims, assertions  
    * Interests: Underlying needs, concerns, motivations  
      * Don’t need to be material (respect)  
    * **Good negotiations focus on interests**  
      * Think about what the interests that underly the positions are

- Who had the power?  
  * Brookside: Power to go into bankruptcy and make litigation difficult; deny good client relationship  
    * Bankruptcy can give more power if played the right way  
    * Power to harm them to get good customers  
  * Black: Brookside was in a bad financial situation; confidence of winning litigation; can damage their reputation (this system was supposed to save them money); Power to hurt and help them

- Rights:  
  * Black: Their claim is based on a pre-text. We can’t trust them; Winning claim at trial given the ambiguous language is beneficial to us  
  * Brookside: The instructions were clear enough. It is part of their DD to have figured this out. They are a hospital. Industry standard is the custom software. They are the experts and they should have known  
    * You are in the right morally

- Interests:  
  * Brookside: Not go bankrupt, New system, Don’t want to be cheated, Growth, Avoid wasting money litigating, Annual updating system, Serve their patients properly, Avoid training costs  
  * Black: Recover K price, New market, Reputation for having a good product, develop the software, maintain reputation for not being pushed around but not being too harsh

- BATNA:  
  * Litigation for both  
    * But BATNA’s within litigation changed

- Possible Integrative Solutions:  
  * Installment payments  
  * Marketing campaign for hospital  
    * Good for hospital: Gives them security that the software will be delivered  
    * Good for computer: Helps them enter the new market  
      * Both suiting both parties interests and is self-enforcing  
  * NDA  
  * Contingency pricing  
    * Contingent on timing, satisfaction, profits  
    * Joint venture  
    * Market development/Product development  
    * Help with the training

- Sometimes the most valuable thing you can get in negotiations is the promise of a second meeting

- Negotiator’s Dilemma: Must share information about your interests to achieve a win-win but sharing information can make you vulnerable  
  * Never give away what your reservation price is

- 15% of value is at stake with this negotiation. This was the difference between good vs bad negotiations

- Custom vs. Universal:  
  * More than half choose custom  
  * Advantage to Brookside is $1M; Cost to Black is $1M  
  * So K for custom is a wash on cost but the 9 months are worth $5.6M to Brookside  
  * Therefore, if you chose custom, you did not maximize value  
    * How does this happen?  
      * No one is sharing complete information  
      * Brookside missed the point that it would cost $5.6M to wait  
      * Think about money in different ways  
      * Stupid client or attaches non-monetary value to something for emotional/marketing reasons

- Sometimes the story is more powerful than numbers

- Lawyer-client dynamic is interesting  
  * Do lawyers help or hurt?

- ZOPA means there can be a deal (reservation prices line up)  
- Bargaining power of each party relies on its BATNA  
- How can parties improve negotiating position?  
  * 1\) Tie your hands  
  * 2\) Learn more about other side’s BATNA  
  * 3\) Improve your BATNA

1. Alice Advocate is a partner at Big Law, whose expertise is mergers and acquisitions. Big Law pays her 100X. Her long-time client, Betty Banker, has been Head of M\&A at Investment Bank. Betty has just been promoted to Head of Investment Banking. She needs to hire someone to replace her as Head of M\&A, and would like to hire Alice.   
     
   Betty also would consider hiring her deputy, Chris, who has been her second-in-command in nearly all of the transactions she has done in the past four years. She thinks Chris would be a good fit as well, but he may be a bit young for this role.  
     
   Alice has sometimes considered leaving her law firm for an investment bank. She sees benefits and costs in making this switch. On the positive side, she expects to earn more money. On the negative side, she likes the craft of lawyering, the ability to be involved in more transactions, and the fact that her law firm is probably more collegial than an investment bank would be. Given these tradeoffs, Alice would leave Big Law for law firm if she is paid $140X, but she won’t make this change for less.   
     
   Meanwhile, Betty meets with Alice and asks her to consider coming to be Head of M\&A at investment bank, and this kicks off a negotiation between them.   
      
   1. What does “BATNA” stand for? In this negotiation, what is Betty’s BATNA? What is Alice’s BATNA?  
- **BATNA \= Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement**  
  * Betty’s BATNA \= Hire Chris (good but young)  
  * Alice’s BATNA \= Stay at firm (likes some components but less money)  
- **BATNA creates a framework for what the deal means to you**  
- **Better BATNA \= Better bargaining power**  
  * **Bargaining power means how appealing are your alternatives to doing the deal**  
  * BATNA translates to price of deal and other terms   
- Bargaining power is overused to explain how a deal played out  
  * **Just because Alice has bargaining power doesn’t mean she would choose to use it on this issue rather than another issue**  
  * But there is no question that it plays a role  
- BATNA helps you understand what bargaining power is and where it comes from  
- How to use bargaining power?  
  * Use it properly – Can lose a deal you should have gotten if you abuse bargaining power

  2. What does the phrase “reservation price” mean? What is Alice’s reservation price as she considers whether to work at Investment Bank?  
- **Reservation Price \= Lowest price a party would accept on deal (and not take BATNA)**  
  * Alice’s Reservation Price \= $140X

  3. What does the term “ZOPA”?  
- **ZOPA \= Zone of Possible Agreement**  
  * Available spread the parties allocate amongst themselves if the deal gets made

  4. Assume that Betty is willing to pay up to 160X to hire Alice. Is there a ZOPA here?  
- Yes, the ZOPA is 20X – from 160X to 140X an agreement can be struck

  5. When there is a ZOPA, does this mean there is definitely going to be an agreement? Why or why not?  
- **Existence of a ZOPA does not guarantee an agreement because (1) offers out of the ZOPA can mischaracterize what each party’s reservation price is and encourage the other party to walk. Or (2) one party may think they can still can get a better deal even if there is an offer in the ZOPA**

- **2 Aspects to This:**  
  * **1\) Are the parties able to figure out the ZOPA (figuring out what the other party’s reservation price is will tell them what the ZOPA is because they know their own reservation price)?**  
    * The parties do not know what the others’ reservation price is so they do not know what the ZOPA is  
      * Alice might think Betty’s reservation price is actually higher (she thinks she can pay more) even if Alice is only asking for half of what she thinks the surplus is  
  * **2\) What is their view about the amount of the surplus they are willing to claim?**  
    * If both parties are accurate in figuring out the ZOPA and both insist on 60 percent of surplus they will not make a deal

- You can never get a deal without a ZOPA, but even with a ZOPA you won’t necessarily get a deal if parties cannot figure it out or think they should get more of the surplus  
    
2. Continuing with the facts above, Betty knows that Alice is very tough in negotiations about money. Indeed, it’s one of the qualities that makes Alice such a strong candidate. So Betty decides to drive a hard bargain, expecting to come up (slowly) in the negotiation, so Alice will feel good about the “concessions” she extracts.   
     
   Meanwhile, Alice is conflicted about whether to leave Big Law. The managing partner, Diane, has been a good friend and mentor to her.   
     
   When Alice asks what compensation Betty has in mind, Betty says, “The main reason to come to Investment Bank is not money. It’s the excitement and professional growth from being a principal in a transaction. Alice, you are so good at representing the principal, but don’t you want to BE the principal? Don’t get me wrong. We will pay you generously. We are thinking of paying you 120X.   
     
1. How is Betty hoping Alice will respond? How does she see the negotiation evolving?  
- Betty is hoping to shift Alice’s focus away from money by adding a new incentive to join Investment Bank  
- **She is starting with a number below her reservation price so that:**  
  * **1\) She can get as much of surplus she can (if she starts at $160X then she gets no surplus)**  
  * **2\) If you make the other side work for it, they will feel as though they got a good deal in the end**  
    * Think about the other party and how they will view things  
      * She knows Alice is scrappy and likes a good negotiation

2. Assume that Alice is very tough when she negotiates about money for her clients, but is not comfortable doing so about herself. If this is the case, how might Betty’s strategy backfire?  
- Betty may misestimate:  
  * 1\) Alice may not want to engage with Betty about other offers and just walk away because she is offended by the low offer  
  * 2\) How Alice will negotiate. Betty’s strategy depends on a strategy that evolves over the conversation  
- **There is an advantage to leaving room but leaving too much room can end the conversation**

3. Instead of “b,” assume that Alice does not mind a tough negotiation on her own behalf, but money isn’t the only thing she cares about. When Betty offers 120X, she replies, “that’s not the number expected, but I’ll think about it.” She ends the conversation because she is supposed to have dinner with Diane that evening and does not want to be late. Again, how might Betty’s strategy not lead to a deal?  
- This might not lead to a deal because it is not enough money for Alice to forgo the parts of her job she likes at Big Law. Further, she might get a better offer to stay from Diane  
- **Starting low means that the negotiation will take a longer time which allows other events to intervene that increase the other party’s BATNA or convince them to walk away from the deal**

4. Instead of “b” and “c,” assume that Alice decides to play tough, knowing that Betty values this quality in her. She decides to exaggerate her demands, expecting to meet in the middle. “I’d love to work more closely with you,” Alice says, ”but not for 120X. To be honest, I don’t think I would get out of bed in the morning for that amount. I would need at least 200X to take this job.” Betty is a bit shocked by this number, which is significantly more than will be paid as Head of Investment Banking. How might Alice’s plan backfire?  
- Alice’s misrepresentation of her reservation price might let Betty think that there is no ZOPA/room for agreement  
- **Coming back too high (just like starting too low) is a strategy that is risky because it will only work if you are confident that the other side will continue negotiating**  
  * But starting low or coming in high are good strategies to capture more of the surplus and convince the other side that they got something

5. Klausner & Subramanian (K\&S) say that even when there is a ZOPA, “**attempts at strategic bargaining can result in no deal**.” What do they mean?  
- Even when the parties are negotiating within the ZOPA, they both want the best deal they can get and thus may not arrive at a deal. Or they may misrepresent their positions to get the best deal, miss the ZOPA and miss the value between them  
  * **If strategic bargaining (I will do this because they will do that work) is wrong, you might lose the deal**

6. Continuing with “d,” assume now that Betty smiles at Alice’s negotiating style. “I wish I could pay you 200X. To be honest, I think you would be worth it,” Betty responds. “But that’s a great deal more than I earned in this role, and I’m sure you would agree that I was pretty good at it. My starting salary was 120X–that’s why I offered that amount to you–but it’s been a few years since then, so let’s make it \_\_\_.” What do you think Betty should offer here? As noted above, Alice would take 140X. Do you think Betty needs to offer that much at this point? What if she offers 125X?  
- If Betty offers 125X, Alice is unlikely to accept but this could be a good strategy regardless to bring Alice closer to her reserve price. When Betty gets near Alice’s reserve price, she will accept, feeling as though she got a fair deal

7. Assuming the negotiation continues, what counter-offer do you think Alice should make? How much should she come down from 200X at this point? What are the competing considerations?  
- Alice should counter with 170X. This number is unlikely to be accepted because it is above Betty’s reserve price. But this is a good counter because it is between the initial counter Alice gave of 200X and the initial offer Betty gave of 120X  
  * Alice needs to consider lowering her amount so that she can show Betty she is willing to negotiate and make an agreement while not lowering it too much because this would not only harm Alice’s chance and taking more of the ZOPA but also risk her seeming untruthful or too far away from Betty’s reserve price that Betty will walk

3. Bidder, a widget manufacturer, is considering buying Target, another widget manufacturer. Target’s board has determined that they would sell for as low as $900X, while Bidder’s board has decided that it is willing to pay up to $1000X.  
   1. What is the ZOPA?  
- $100X from $900X to $1000X

  2. There is $100X of value which can be gained in this transaction. How will the parties determine how it is divided? According to K\&S, what role does bargaining power play?  
- Bargaining determines how much of the ZOPA you can take. The parties divide the ZOPA through negotiations. The party that cares the least about the deal will take more of the ZOPA  
  * **External factors and the skill of negotiating will play into bargaining power but mainly it will be improving your BATNA**

  3. K\&S mention different ways to improve bargaining power. The first is “improve your BATNA.” How could Bidder use this strategy? How could Target use it?  
- If Bidder had a BATNA (another company) of $950X, then they have bargaining power to tell Target that they will not accept a deal under that price  
  * Same goes for Target if they had another offer of $950X  
- **Benefits of bettering BATNA (another acquisition target):**  
  * **1\) Gives you another option, safety valve**  
  * **2\) Weakens the other parties’ position (they are scared you walk)**

  4. The second is “tie your hands.” Give an example of how bidder could use this strategy?  
- Bidder could use the tie your hands strategy by saying and accurately representing to Target that they do not have the money to buy them for any more than $920X

  5. How could Target tie its hands?  
- Target could use the tie your hands strategy by saying and accurately representing to Bidder that they will not be able to get shareholder approval of any deal less than $980X  
  * Help me help you  
- **Ironic: Negotiation strategy could be to represent that you have less power as opposed to more**  
  * **But then people will worry that you are misrepresenting your lack of power so you can make it real by guaranteeing shareholders you will not accept a deal below X price**  
  * **This also risks the other party walking away at the lower number when you actually would have accepted that price**

  6. K\&S mentions a third strategy: “learn about the other side’s BATNA.” How could each side do this in the above transaction?  
- Each party could assemble a “clean team” like K\&S suggest that is not involved in the transaction to research the other side’s wants, needs, and overall leverage

  7. Sellers sometimes try to trigger an auction. Which of the three bargaining power strategies is this?  
- Improve your BATNA

  8. As we discussed in an earlier class, sellers that are public companies must get the approval of their shareholders to sell the company. Which of the three bargaining power strategies is this?  
- Tie your hands

  9. How would the parties negotiate this deal using “Full Open and Truthful Exchange” or “FOTE” model?  
- Bidder would tell Target that they are willing to pay up to $1,000X, and Target will tell Bidder that they are willing to accept $900X. The parties will settle somewhere in the middle of the ZOPA, probably around $950X

  10. How would they negotiate it with the “Poker School” approach?  
- The Poker School Approach employs deception to negotiate

  11. If Target uses the FOTE approach and Bidder uses the Poker School approach, how will this negotiation play out?  
- Bidder will dominate Target and capture most of the ZOPA because they will have accurate information about Target which they can use to deceive Target and create a better deal for themselves

- **In a world where everyone has access to Poker School and FOTE methods, everyone will use Poker School because they will assume that the other party is doing the same. If they use FOTE they will risk being at a great disadvantage**  
  * **The theoretical benefits of FOTE cannot exist**  
- This is just a version of the asymmetric information and incentive problems in new light

  12. Same as “k,” but Target catches Bidder in an exaggeration. What will happen?  
- Target may walk from the deal and Bidder may lose out entirely or at the least will change their approach to Poker School not FOTE  
  * Any claims Bidder makes thereafter will be discounted

4. Dean Dana is speaking with Professor Paul about whether he will accept an offer to join Dean Dana’s faculty. They need to agree on six issues: Paul’s salary, which courses he will teach; whether he will have a named professorship; which office he will have; what administrative responsibilities he will take on; and how much secretarial support he will receive.  
   1. Paul wants to work his way down the list, deciding one at a time. Dana wants to hear his views on each issue before deciding any of them. Which approach is better and why?  
- Dana’s approach of hearing his views on all issues and then deciding is better because it is easier to make trade-offs and therefore a deal this way. Paul’s approach of deciding each term one by one in isolation makes each a zero sum game  
  * **It is always better to have the full picture in a negotiation before agreeing to terms one by one because you will feel stronger about some issues over others which creates room to make a deal (ZOPA)**

  2. Assume that Dana has a large corner office available (because it’s occupant just retired). She really needs someone to teach the courses Paul usually teaches. She does not have a named professorship at the moment, but expects to have one in three years. Assume also that Paul has no need for secretarial assistance, hates administrative work, and wants to maximize his salary.  
     1. Assuming that all that matters is the preferences and needs of Dana and Paul, what would their deal look like?  
- Big salary, Corner office, No administrative work, Courses Paul usually teaches, No secretarial assistant, No named professorship but guaranteed one in three years  
- **Each has things they need, they can put all the issues together**  
  2. Now let’s add another variable: Dana worries about setting precedents, so that other professors would ask for what Paul got. How does this complicate the negotiation?  
- This may complicate things because even though Dana has the ability to offer Paul some things like no administrative work, she doesn’t want to because she then she will have to offer those things to others. (And if no one is doing administrative work that would be a problem)  
- If you use a wholistic approach and view all the issues together you will probably produce a better deal for everyone because you can give/make concessions. This is weakened by precedent setting  
  * **Precedent undercuts the flexibility of a party to make concessions across issues because you may not be able to give them to others**  
  * **To know what precedents will be set, you also need to know how much of them will be observable**  
    * **Selective Use of Parts of the Deal: Unless all aspects of the deal are public, it is unlikely that all dimensions of the deal will be compared to establish precedents. Instead, specific parts of the deal will get compared**  
    3. In iii, is the negotiation easier or harder if other faculty might be able to observe some, but not all, of what Paul received?  
- This would make it easier because if others cannot observe what Paul received, then they will not know to ask for it. And therefore, Dana will not need to worry about setting a bad precedent  
- This will weaken the all-terms-at the same time approach and strengthen the line by line approach because once you think about precedent you need to think about how much of it will be observable. Unless all aspects of the deal are public, it is unlikely that future deals will be negotiated with this deal as precedent in its entirety (instead parts of it will be used as precedent)  
  * Instead, specific parts of the deal will be compared and then specific parts will be used as precedent  
    4. How (if at all) can Dana turn her precedent problem into a negotiation advantage? (Hint: consider the three bargaining power principles discussed above.)  
- **Tie your hands strategy: Dana can say to Paul that she wants to offer him these things, but she cannot or else she would have to offer them to everyone**  
  * “I wish I could because you deserve it but \[if I do that for you, I have to do that for others\] or \[I cannot get shareholder approval\]  
    5. Assume that Paul has the non-salary terms he wants at his current employer. How can he use this as a negotiating advantage? (Hint: consider the three bargaining power principles discussed above.)  
- **Improving BANTA:** If Paul has all the non-salary terms at his other employer, his next best alternative, staying is pretty good. He will demand these or at least components of them or some of them from Dana in order to engage in a deal  
  * **If you are able to use this outside opportunity to improve your current situation, the existence of each alternative strengthens your hand with the other**  
    * **Less at stake with either option because you like both of them**  
    6. If Paul tells Dana that he has the non-salary terms he wants at his current school, is there a reason why Dana might not find this persuasive? (Hint: remember the Poker School.) Is it easy or hard for her to tell him why she is not persuaded? How necessary (if it all) is it for her to tell him?  
- Dana may not be persuaded because she may think Paul is intentionally trying to deceive her to get a better deal for himself by inflating his BATNA  
  * Lack of credibility in the claims because you do not know what is true and what is not  
- It is pretty easy for Dana to tell Paul that she is not persuaded. She can just talk to him  
- It may not be necessary for Dana to tell Paul that she is not persuaded. Instead, she can just call his bluff not through words but by just offering a worse deal than Paul is asking for and see if accepts anyways

- **Asymmetric Information and Incentive Problems: You don’t know if the demands of the other party are accurately what he already has in his current situation (his BATNA) and he has an incentive to lie to you to get more concessions from you**  
  * **It is hard for you to know if the claims are credible because you cannot call up his current employer and say you are trying to hire him. So his claims are not credible**  
    * **These information and incentive problems cause fewer transactions to happen**

# 16: Literary Industry

- See literary industry as incentive and information problems and agency costs  
  * The way industries develop is to address these problems  
- Information Problems:  
  * Uncertainty: Will new author sell the book  
  * Asymmetry: Even with authors who aren’t first timers, they better understand how the book will be and how appealing it will be than publisher  
- Incentive Problems:  
  * Agency costs: Author isn’t going to be forthcoming about how good the book will be  
- Search costs: Publishing companies need to narrow the way they look for books  
  * Creates alignment between publishers and agents (publishing companies give agents a privileged position but agent needs to narrow the field to the books publisher will like)

- Agent and author: Align complexities  
  * Agent paid only when author paid  
  * Agent paid in percentage: More agent gets, more author gets  
  * Agent wants fixed amount \+ contingency:  
    * Agent wants this because she will have to work to sell the book. Doesn’t want to walk away with nothing if it doesn’t get sold because the author is new  
    * Providing fixed payment is hard to know whether agent is going to actually work that hard  
      * Deal with this through:  
        * **Gathering information:** Track record, how did other books do?  
        * **Compensation formula:** Flawed. Agent gets a better deal with a lower royalty when the signing deal is above a certain threshold  
          * Perverse incentive: Agent is better keeping royalty below the threshold. Incentivized to get a less good deal  
          * Some lawyers may not address the business terms of the parties. But lawyers are there to help clients identify risks and structure alternatives and address the risks  
            * Lawyers need to:  
              * 1\) See the odd result  
              * 2\) Figure out what is causing the problem  
              * 3\) Offer alternative  
          * Problem:  
            * Fixed payment of $6K \+ 15% royalty  
            * Phasing out of fixed payment at a certain level of advance  
              * Agent is better off below that level  
          * Alternatives:  
            * Same fixed payment without phasing out \+ Same percentage  
            * Smaller fixed payment without phasing out \+ Same percentage  
            * Same fixed payment without phasing out \+ Smaller percentage

- Need to have a greater ability to reading K drafts  
  * Author-profit participation agreement

1. Your college roommate, Barbara, is a management consultant. Her job is to do an assessment of troubled companies and suggest ways to turn them around. She is the founder and principal of “Turnaround Consulting” or “TC.”   
     
   Barbara decides to write a business book, *Turning It Around: How to Turn a Failed Business into a Market Leader*. She has the urge to share what she knows, and she also wants to use the book to raise her profile, hoping it will help her broaden her base of clients.  
     
   Barbara doesn’t get much repeat business, since the executives she advises usually are a bit embarrassed about having to hire her and want to forget the anxious experience of nearly going bankrupt, so they don’t usually stay in touch or hire her again. This means she needs a constant stream of new work to stay busy.  
     
   To help her attract more consulting work, Barbara is hoping to get a publishing contract with an elite publishing house, which has the resources to help her make it a best seller. But these publishing houses generally won’t deal with an author directly. They usually accept proposals only from a literary agent, who is supposed to submit the book proposal on the author’s behalf.   
     
   As a backup, Barbara is also open to publishing the book in an academic press, although she knows that her royalty on the book will be significantly lower and the academic press will not do as much to market the book. In this situation, she will do her best to market it on her own.  
     
   This is all new territory for Barbara, and she appreciates that you are willing to give her legal and business advice when she needs it. She starts by calling you with two questions:

   1. Why do you think elite publishing houses work only with agents? What incentive or information problems are the agents meant to solve?  
- **Efficiency:** Delegates educational function to third party (agent) so that an author doesn’t have to learn a new business and take up the time of the publishing company  
  * Agents have the relationships so there is ease of access  
  * Publishing company doesn’t have to explain everything to every author. Agent does that for them

- **Incentive Problem:** Authors do not have a realistic assessment of the quality of the book they are going to write  
  * Every author thinks that their book is the best. Agent and publishing house take emotional element out of it and can evaluate it realistically  
    * Every author thinks their book will sell so publishing house has no way to gauge its prospects  
  * Agent also has this problem because they want to represent client to best of abilities, oversell book. However, this is better than the author because agents have a repeat relationships with the publishing houses (while authors who don’t have these repeat relationships have unlimited incentives to advocate for themselves  
    * Agent dampens the incentive problem

- **Asymmetric Information Problem:** There is uncertainty because usually book hasn’t been written yet. And the author knows best what the book will look like  
  * Agents do preliminary screen of authors. They are selective about which to take on as clients which gives them credibility to publishing houses. The publishing house delegates the diligence work to the agent

  2. Why do you think this function is thought to be less important in academic presses?  
- Academic presses care less about commercial aspect  
- But problems still remain:  
  * Incentive Problem: Authors tend to be generous of assessment of own abilities  
  * Asymmetric Info. Problem: Book hasn’t been written so hard to know if it will be good  
    * **But there is less asymmetric info. problem with academics because they have probably written other works and also are hired by institutions that credential them (this seal of approval would normally be provided by the agent). So the need for agent is less**

Schizer OH:

- Hiring process outsourced to colleges, law schools. Like how the publishing houses outsource author credentialing to agents  
- Agent structure – like broker agreements. The list provided to author at the end of the agreement of potential clients  
- Where did we leave off with leverage? Is that a synonym for bargaining power?  
- In the situation where you have asymmetry of information and someone has multiple motives for saying it or representing that information and you are not sure which (like why agent won't share list of publishers she knows), is what we have said the main solution should be to try to get more information? Or push further? Or then align incentives so that you no longer need that information?

2. Barbara has a friend, Chris, who published a book recently after hiring Alice, a literary agent. After Chris introduces Barbara to Alice, Barbara shares her a draft of the book proposal she plans to use, which gives an overview of the book, summarizes her own experience, and explains the potential market for the book. They meet for breakfast, and Alice says she is open to representing Barbara.  
   1. Barbara asks what Alice’s strategy will be for selling the book to a publisher. Alice says she will put together a list of ten publishing houses, run the list by Barbara, and then send the proposal to editors she knows at these houses. When Barbara asks for examples of the houses Alice has in mind, Alice smiles and says, “Well, you have to hire me first, and then we can talk in detail about that.” After the breakfast, Barbara calls and repeats this to you and asks if you think Alice’s position is reasonable. Or should Barbara be worried?  
- Alice Perspective (Innocent): Alice’s position is reasonable because her client list and strategy for publication is her asset. She shouldn’t give this away for free. This is her value  
- Barbara Perspective (Concerning): Asymmetry of information. Alice may be trying to just get hired but actually has no idea about this. She may not have any expertise about this  
  * The unwillingness to say anything may signal that she knows nothing about this or that she knows a lot about this

- **2 Different Sources of Value that Alice could offer:**  
  * **1\) Personal Relationships – Friends with execs.**  
    * **Telling author about these would not be given away for free. She knows people at the publishing houses and can get author in there, but by telling the author she is not sacrificing these relationships**  
  * **2\) Expertise – Knowing the best fit**  
    * **Telling author about this would be value given away for free. She can tell you which publishing house is best for this book, but if she tells you her information on which publishing houses are best, she is giving that away**

  2. If the above comment can be read as either harmless or concerning, how (if at all) can Barbara learn more to try to make a judgment about this?  
- Since her unwillingness to explain information raises the possibility that she is fraud, you need to try to see past it. What can Barbara do?  
  * **Ask others in the industry**  
  * **Ask Alice her track record with other authors**  
    * Who are you represented? Where have you been placing books?


3. Alice sends Barbara a draft contract to formalize her status as Barbara’s agent. “Take a look at it and let me know if you have any question,” Alice says in her email.   
     
   Alice charges a commission that (among other things) provides her with 15% of “Gross Proceeds” from “the Property.” She sends you the relevant language:   
     
   *You, Barbara (the “Author”), hereby engage Alice (the “Agent”) as the Author’s **sole and exclusive Agent** to negotiate for the publication, and other disposition throughout the world of the hardcover, paperback rights, books on tape, television, motion picture, electronic and ancillary and allied rights whether now or to become known in the future, as customarily understood within the entertainment industry (“Rights”) in and to the Author’s properties (the “Properties”) a book tentatively entitled “Turning It Around: How to Turn a Failed Business into a Market Leader.”*  
     
   *In full consideration of Agent’s services hereunder, the Author agrees to pay Agent a commission equal to Fifteen Percent (15%) of all “Gross Proceeds” derived from the exploitation of the Rights except Ten Percent (10%) from the exploitation of television and film (“Compensation”).  “Gross Proceeds” are hereby defined as meaning all monies, receipts and consideration of every kind (including salaries, royalties, bonuses, shares of profits, loans, speaking fees, consulting fees, and any and all other forms of cash compensation), paid to the Author or to any designee of the Author, arising out of or paid pursuant to the disposition and/or exploitation of the Rights and the subject matter discussed in the Properties, pursuant to written or oral agreements negotiated by Agent or the Author (including any renewals, modifications, options or extensions thereof, regardless of when made and regardless of by whom negotiated)*   
     
- Alice gets paid for these services by selling book rights and generating an income stream (10% TV and film, 15% Gross proceeds)  
  * Gross proceeds \= All money that comes in  
  * Gross proceeds not only includes 15% of core royalty from copies sold but also of outside work. Very broad

1. Given what you know about Barbara’s professional life, what concern do you have about the definition of “gross proceeds”?  
- Author Concern: Barbara is also a consultant separately from being an author so Alice could take her future consulting fees that are not tied to the book  
  * The agent should not share in consulting business

- **Concerning passages:**  
  * **Delete “consulting fees” – These do not arise out of the book**  
  * **Rewrite “the Rights and the subject matter discussed in the Properties”**  
    * **Book is about her business so need to delete “subject matter discussed in the Properties” because agent gets a piece of the book – not the subject matter of the book which is her business**

2. How might Alice try to justify a broad definition of “gross proceeds”?  
- **Agent’s 2 Arguments:**  
  * **1\) She has had a problem with some authors where they cut a side deal to give away book for free but get paid a lot for a speaking fee. You shouldn’t be able to reclassify payments to avoid my royalty**  
    * **Could be dealt with more directly**  
  * **2\) Alice wants to become partner in consulting business. Her additional consulting revenue is because of the book and Alice’s work**  
    * **Barabara should say no, the book exists because of my business. She was doing consulting for a long time before the book**

3. What modifications in the language would you suggest–either to modify the definition or to add other language?  
- The specific words that create the broad gross proceeds issue:  
  * “Consulting fees” – Take this out  
    * These are not tied to a book. It goes beyond the book  
  * “and the subject matter discussed in the properties” – Take this out  
    * Book is about her business  
    * Agent’s money should come from the book. Not the other parts of the book  
    * Best kind of re-writing: The less intrusive it seems upon mark-up, the more likely you are to get away with it  
      * Deleting words is key for this

4. Alice’s draft agreement includes the following language about terminating the agreement:  
     
   *Agent agrees to use such reasonable efforts on the Author’s behalf as Agent deems appropriate to cause the disposition of the Rights.  However, Agent makes no representation that Agent will in fact effect such disposition.  If within 12 months of execution of this Agreement Agent has failed to obtain a bona fide offer for the disposition of one of the Rights to the Property, acceptable to the Author, the Author may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Agent upon written receipt by Agent subject to the Continuation period pursuant to 2(b).*  

   
*If the Author receives a proposal with respect to the Rights during the Term of this Agreement, the Author will promptly refer such proposal to Agent.  All contracts and other arrangements negotiated by Agent on the Author’s behalf shall be subject to the Author’s approval and shall be in the Author’s name or in such other name as designated by the Author in writing.  Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, the Author reserves all rights to himself to accept or reject any offer for the disposition of any Rights to the Property and the Agent has no right or authority to bind, or otherwise create an obligation for, the Author or his Rights or the Property.*  

*The Author shall have no obligation to Agent, at any time with regard to any other existing or future literary projects or any other project the Author may wish to undertake and exploit, by themselves or through any other person, firm or entity acting as the Author’s agent except for the obligations set forth in this Agreement.  Agent has the authority to represent to others that she is the Author’s Agent.   Irrespective of whether or not Author hires a subsequent agent, Agent shall be the agent on the next book published if the publisher (“Publisher”) of the Property publishes the Author’s next book.*

1. Why is it important for the agreement not to be indefinite? What information or incentive problems does this solve?  
- Important for services to be fixed so that obligations are clear/creates certainty

- **Time limit protects the author (Incentive problem)**  
  * **The royalty creates an incentive to get the books sold. Part of the effort to align incentives is contingent compensation but it doesn’t work if indefinite because then agent could just say, I’ll turn to this when I can**  
- **Time limit also protects the agent (Asymmetric information)**  
  * **If the author is bad, the agent wants to walk away**  
- **Time limit can serve both of their interests**

  2. Why is it important for the agreement to have a stated term, so that Barbara cannot terminate it at will? What information or incentive problems does this solve? What information or incentive problems does this term create?  
- Contractual provisions have 2 rationales:  
  * 1\) One that is true of ordinary business events  
  * 2\) But there is also an anti-abuse, anti-exploitation element to this

- **Not terminable at will protects both parties**  
  * **Ordinary Business Events (Protect Agent): You need to give agent a runway to see the fruits of her labor and get the book to be successful. Not canceled at will prevents author from abandoning her after she has worked hard on getting the book sold but it is too early for it to sell a lot**  
  * **Ordinary Business Events (Protect Author): Need to give the author an out if after a certain time agent is not doing a good job**  
  * **Anti-Abuse/Anti-Exploitation (Protect Agent): If author could terminate at-will, she could glean everything she wanted out of Alice and get the publishing house contacts and then cancel agreement and undercut her**  
    * If she could just terminate at-will, author could just get the contacts from agent and not include agent

  3. The contract provides that even after the agreement is terminated, Alice still earns a commission on gross proceeds from a deal “within six (6) months after the end of the Term (“Continuation Period”) with any purchaser who evidenced during the Term an indication of interest in negotiating or executing such an Agreement.  Upon such termination and upon Author’s request, Agent will furnish to you a list of publishers and other parties to whom she submitted the materials related to the Property (or the Property itself). If during the Continuation Period, the Author sells or transfers any of the Rights in the Book to a person or company on this list, Agent shall be entitled to her full commission under this Agreement with respect to the Property.”  
     1. Is it reasonable for Barbara to agree to this?  
- **Protects Agent:** Yes. This prevents the scenario where the publishing house conversation is happening at the end of the K term and author lets it drag out so that agent’s K expires and author can go directly to the publishing house, undercutting the agent

  2. Why should Alice have to provide the list to Barbara? In what context is she likely to use this list?  
- **Protection against abuse:** The extension period can protect agent from author (above). But **author needs to be protected from agent too** in this extension provision  
  * **The list shows author that agent was actually involved and can’t just claim it was her work after the fact**  
- **Incentive problems going both ways here**

  4. Barbara also asks you the following question: “I see that Alice is automatically my agent on my second book, if I publish it with the publisher who published my first book. Is it reasonable for Alice to ask for that?” What is your answer?  
- Reasonable because she would only have this connection because of Alice

  5. Assuming Barbara is generally willing to agree to the term discussed in “d,” should Barbara ask for any limits on Alice’s claim automatically to be the agent on the second book? (First hint: assume Alice is seventy-five years old.) (Second hint: assume that Barbara is very demanding and at times can come across as abrasive, a reality that reinforces the pattern, noted above, that she does not usually have repeat clients.)  
- 1\) Alice’s estate should be compensated even if Alice is no longer around because there is no work to place the next book with the same publisher  
  * Author may not accept this  
- 2\) If agent is unwilling to work with you, they shouldn’t be paid even if you place the book at the same publisher


5. The contract uses the following (complicated) clause to define Alice’s commission. Barbara has a number of questions about it:  
     
   *Compensation.  In full consideration of Agent’s services hereunder, the Author agree to pay Agent a commission equal to Fifteen Percent (15%) of all “Gross Proceeds” derived from the exploitation of the Rights.*   
   *Moreover, a minimum fee of Six Thousand  Dollars ($6000) (“Minimum Payment”) is owed to Agent. Three Thousand ($3000) is due upon signing this Agreement and Three Thousand is due when  the advance accepted by the Author is equal to or less than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000).  By way of example: if the advance is Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) or less, the second payment of $3000 shall be due to the Agent within ten days of accepting publisher’s offer.*   
     
   *If the advance is greater than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000), the second payment is not owed and the $3000 already paid shall be deducted from the Agent’s share paid by the Publisher.*   
     
   *If the Author does not accept an offer or after the end of one year no contract is available, then Agent retains the Three Thousand Dollars ($3000). The Minimum Payment shall be in addition to the commission due to Agent in accordance with this section as stated above for Fifteen (15%) of Gross Proceeds.”* 

   1. A minimum fee is not customary for literary agents. Why do you think that is the case?  
- **2 Ways the agent gets paid:**  
  * **Usual agent compensation \= 15%**  
    * **If advance is more than $25K 🡪 Compensation \= 15% (Agent does not take additional $3K and deducts initial $3K from their 15% compensation)**  
    * **If advance is equal or less than $25K 🡪 Compensation \= $6K \+ 15% (Agent will already have taken $3K, gets an additional $3K in 10 days if there is a deal, and gets 15%) (If there is no deal, agent gets $3K only – no additional $3K if no deal and no 15%)**

- **No minimum fee because you want to align incentives. This structure changes the incentives in the face of an information problem (Agent could say she is going to do a great job and mean it or she might do nothing for you)**  
  * **Like VC: You could write a K that specifies everything agent must do. But it is more efficient to share the profits instead of monitoring each other**

  2. When Barbara asks Alice to remove the minimum fee, Alice declines to do so. What explanation do you think Alice is likely to give? (Hint: One of her specialties is to represent first-time authors.)  
- First-time authors have uncertainty  
  * If agent’s compensation is tied to proceeds and there aren’t any, then she is out of luck  
  * If there was no minimum fee, agents would only take on accomplished authors to get the royalty

  3. In analyzing whether she is comfortable with the minimum fee, what question should Barbara ask Alice? What information would be relevant?  
- Concern: Agent is signaling to author that the book might not sell – if she knew it would sell, she wouldn’t need fixed payment  
- So then author might say why are you representing me if you don’t believe in me?  
  * Agent can respond that she just needed that added insurance  
  * But is also could be that agent is going to take the minimum fee and not work hard  
  * It is hard for author to figure out which of these is the truth

  4. If Alice insists on keeping the minimum fee in the contract, what signal, if any, does this send to Barbara? Is this new information to Barbara?  
- Agent is signaling that she is not that confident in author’s work by insisting on minimum fee which is new information to author

  5. If Barbara is hesitant about agreeing to pay a minimum fee, what signal, if any, does this send to Alice? Is this new information to Alice?  
- By being hesitant to pay minimum fee, author is signaling that she is not that confident that her own work will sell. This is new information to agent  
  * The inclusion of the minimum fee is inconsistent with the way the market is supposed to work. Ideally, each party is so confident that they are willing to work purely off of sharing the profits (contingency)  
    * **This minimum fee might chill the interest of the parties to deal with each other**  
  * Agent’s lack of confidence is even more concerning because she understands the industry better

  6. Recall that Alice has the right automatically to be the agent on Barbara’s second book in certain circumstances. In light of this right, what change should Barbara request in the above paragraph on Alice’s commission?  
- Author should request no minimum fee if Alice continues to be her agent on the second book because by then she has proven herself and earned agent’s trust that the book will be successful

  7. Assume that Barbara’s advance for the book (the cash payment she receives from the publisher upon signing the contract) is $25,000. What is Alice’s commission?  
- $6K in minimum fee (two advances) \+ 15%($25K) \= $9,750  
  * (Has to be more than $25K to get 15% alone)

  8. Assume that the advance is much higher–$50,000. What is Alice’s commission?  
- The commission does not double because there is no minimum fee anymore  
  * All Alice gets is 15%($50K) \= $7,500

  9. Compare the answers in “g” and “h.” What problem do you see? What is the source of this problem?  
- $25K advance \= $9,750 fee to agent  
- $50K advance \= $7,500 fee to agent  
  * **Incentive Problem: This is a problem because the agent is better off getting you a lower advance**

  10. What changes in the formula could fix the problem identified in “i”? Please suggest a couple of options. What other problems (if any) do these options create?  
- **2 Problems:**  
  * **1\) Inclusion of the fixed fee**  
  * **2\) The phasing out of the fixed fee**  
    * **She stops getting the $6K is a reward for keeping the advance low**

- **Fixing the incentive problem:**  
  * **15 percent contingent payment with no minimum fee**  
    * But Alice might require the fix fee  
  * **$6K \+ 15% royalty all the way up**  
    * Too big an advance but no incentive problem (as the agent got a bigger book deal, they keep more so they are incentivized to get you more)  
  * **$3K \+ 20% royalty all the way up**  
    * Similar to the problems that the tax system faces but less drastic because minimum fee is smaller

    

6. Barbara hires Alice, and Alice sends the book proposal to a number of publishers. Erin Editor from Packaging Press calls the next day to say that she is interested, but with a caveat. “Publishing a book likes this costs money,” Erin says. “The up front cost is about $100,000.” Barbara is a first time author, so there is a lot of uncertainty about whether her book will sell, and it’s a book for a targeted professional audience. “Barbara will have to commit to buy 5,000 copies of the book,” Erin says, “and we will charge her $12 per copy.”   
   1. As Erin said, there is always a risk that the book won’t sell. Under Erin’s proposal, how is that risk allocated? Who loses money?  
- $100K risk is allocated between author and publisher  
  * Author bears: 60% (Paid $60K \- $12(5K copies))  
    * Shifts risk to author that otherwise publisher might bear  
  * Publisher bears: 40% (Got $60K and bears $40K)

  2. Alice asks Erin how Barbara can make money on the book. “She can then resell them to her clients at whatever price she wants,” Erin says. Barbara calls to ask you for business advice about this proposal. In deciding whether to do this, what issues should she consider?  
- Market capacity potential and her capacity to take advantage of it  
  * Market Capacity: They made her cover a portion of the cost but if she can resell for $24, she is getting a 50% discount (she needs to know what her discount is going to be)  
    * They made her cover a portion of the cost but she didn’t pay market price  
  * Capacity to take advantage of it: Publisher has better capacity to sell book because of expertise, sales relationships, etc. but they are outsourcing some of this to author  
    * She has the job of selling 5K copies. Can she do that by herself?

  3. Alice asks Erin whether Packaging Press will also try to sell the book. “Yes,” Erin says. “We will sell it on Amazon.” This is both good and bad for Barbara. Why?  
- This is good because Amazon will help her reach more buyers  
- This is bad because publisher on Amazon competes with author if she needs to resell the books

- The publisher and the author are competing to sell 5K copies  
  * If the audience is 100K this isn’t a problem  
  * If the audience is 5K this is a problem

  4. Barbara asks how Barbara would be compensated for books that Packaging Press sells on Amazon. “It’s the usual deal in the industry,” Erin says. “Barbara will get a 10% royalty for the first 5,000 copies sold, a 12% royalty for the next 5,000 copies sold, and a 15% royalty for the rest of the books.” Is Barbara likely to make more on the books she sells herself or on the books Packaging sells on Amazon?  
- Author can earn more by selling the book herself, but it is riskier and more labor intensive  
  * 10% royalty \= $2.40 on a $24 book  
  * As long as she sells her own copies for more than $14.40 ($12 book \+ $2.40 royalty) she will make more on the copies she sells herself  
    * But this is also riskier because it is unclear that she is able to do that

  5. To evaluate the royalties in part “d,” what other information do you need? (Hint: there are “list” royalties and “net sale” royalties and one is better than the other.)  
- Author needs to know how the royalty is calculated  
  * **List Royalty \= Percentage of the book’s retail price**  
    * $24 list price \= $2.40 royalty  
    * This is better for author  
  * **Net Sale Royalty \= Based on the amount the publisher receives after the retailers discounts**  
    * The retailer will discount the book to get more sold

7. The next day, Alice gets a call from Ed Editor, who works at Publisher Press (“PP”). Ed also is interested in publishing the book, so he sends Alice a draft contract (which was assigned as reading) and Alice shares it with Barbara.   
   1. In this deal, who bears the risk that the book won’t sell well?  
- The publisher bears the risk because the publisher shares 50% of **profit**  
  * **Publisher bears the risk that the expenses do not get recovered (the expenses get deducted from revenue and author gets 50% of profit)**  
- This is different from the last deal where the publisher forced the author to cover 60% of costs by purchasing books

  2. In Ed’s draft contract, when (if ever) does Barbara have to buy books? (Hint: Look at section 8.) If it is a priority to Barbara not to have to buy books, how concerned should she be about the offer from PP? To what extent (if at all) does Barbara control whether she has to buy books?  
- Author only has to buy books in the event that there is excess production in which case she pays a heavily discounted price  
  * Mostly she doesn’t have to buy books unlike the other deal where author buys books to bear some of the cost  
  * She might be able to influence this by having them print fewer books

  3. In PP’s offer, how is Barbara compensated? How is this different from Erin’s offer? Which is better? What other information do you want in order to compare them?  
- In Erin’s offer, author has to sell books herself but keeps 100% of her profit on these copies  
- In Ed’s offer, publisher sells all the books but author keeps 50% of profits

- Want to know the price at which author is going to sell her books  
  * Is the $12 in Erin’s offer really a discounted price? Is she willing to bear this downside risk? How likely is it that she will profit from selling these?  
- In the second deal, she bears no risk with potential for 50% of profits  
  * She can’t lose money like she can in the first deal

  4. “Remaindering” a book means that the publisher has too much stock of a book, so they sell it off at a very low price. There are companies who buy and distribute remainders. Alice Agent objects to the way remainder sales are structured in PP’s draft contract. What do you think is her concern? What argument should she make to change it? (Hint–how are these sales treated differently than other sales?)  What argument do you think PP will make? (Hint–it has to do with incentives.)  
- Remainder sales are not subject to profit participation which is bad for author  
  * PP will argue that it needs to get rid of other copies and recoup its expenses  
  * PP will also argue that they are remaindering the books because it is more expensive to store them than to just get rid of them. **Author won’t get profits from these so she is incentivized to not get remaindered and will help sell the books**  
    * Author Counter: I don’t control when you remainder – this is about your storage costs. Same 50% should most likely apply regardless of how the books are used

8. Since you are a lawyer, Barbara calls you with some questions about PP’s proposed contract.   
   1. Barbara is very meticulous about language. She thinks carefully about every word, and she writes and rewrites and rewrites again in order to get it just right. Who has the final say about the language under this contract? What change, if any, might Barbara want to make in the contract? (2e – Editing)  
- Publisher submits edits to the author for approval  
- **Exceptions: 2 Potential Scenarios where Barbara doesn’t have the final say:**  
  * **1\) She says no and they claim she is being unreasonable**  
  * **2\) Non-habitual: They messed up and forgot to share the edits (if they forget rarely it’s okay)**  
    * **Author will push back on this**

  2. Barbara wants an index. Under the proposed contract, will PP provide one?  
- 1c – Parties agree that no index will be included in the book

  3. Barbara wants an e-book version made. Is PP committing to do one? If not, can Barbara arrange for this separately with another publisher? What changes, if any, do you think should be made to this provision? (Hint: see Secton 3.)  
- Publisher has the option to make an e-book. They are given the right to make the e-book version but do not have to  
- **3(a)(iii): If the publisher does not exploit this right within one year, author may find another publisher to do it**  
  * **But this is a bad situation for author because you want the e-book to come out at the same time as the regular book**

  4. Barbara has a temper. She is blunt and sometimes says things that offend people. She’s proud of the fact that she’s not “politically correct.” As her lawyer, what warning do you need to give her about the draft contract?  
- **Morality Provision (iv):** Marketability of the author’s image is negatively affected  
  * She loses the book deal if she blows up in the wrong way at the wrong time

  5. Barbara plans to urge consulting clients to buy the book in bulk. She’d like for them to get a discount when they do. What (if anything) does the contract say about that? What changes, if any, do you think she should request?  
- **7(c): Bulk purchases by third parties**  
  * Discounts are on a case-by-case basis  
  * **You could negotiate:**  
    * **1\) That bulk sales should also be subject to discount scheme**  
    * **2\) To clarify what the discount is**  
      * **Treating third party bulk purchases differently than the author who has a specified discount**  
      * **Even if it is going to be a case-by-case basis, she would want some parameters (if purchaser orders X number of copies, they get Y percent discount)**

  6. Barbara is willing to travel to try to drum up book sales, giving book talks, signing books, etc. If PP arranges this sort of event, who will bear Barbara’s travel costs?  
- 9: If publisher arranges the event, publisher pays for costs, but otherwise they won’t  
  * Publisher may think that this is good for them because they can decide if an event if worth the money

- Also, “covering the costs” might include the expenses that impact profits which she gets paid off of  
  * The travel might count as expenses, part of which she bears in taking the profits (half the cost actually comes from her)

  7. Assume that Barbara hopes to write a sequel, “Turning it Around Again.” Is she obligated to publish it with PP?  
- **3(c): Publisher has option to make an offer on a sequel but no obligation to publish sequel (ROFR)**  
  * “Turning It Around Again” will probably be covered by this because it seems like the same subject matter  
- **But if she doesn’t want to work with this publisher again, she doesn’t have to. The publisher’s only right is to make an offer**  
  * **BUT the offer needs to go to PP first and then wait 30 days to field other offers**  
  * **She cannot skip this step and offer to other publishers first**

  8. If Barbara thinks the payments she is getting seem low, what rights would she have to verify that they are correct? Keep in mind that Barbara is a “numbers person,” who is very comfortable checking this sort of information on her own. Since you know this about her, what change would you suggest in the contract?  
- **K requires her to send independent CPA to look at books at her cost**  
- **She wants to change the language to say: Author, agent, or independent CPA can inspect**

  9. Barbara lives in NY. If she has a dispute with Publishing Press, and needs a lawyer’s help, what disadvantage does she face?  
- Any disputes on the K must be resolved in OH (probably inconvenient)  
- They are unlikely to agree to changing the governing laws of the state they do business in

9. Barbara needs to decide between Erin and Ed’s offer. She knows that Erin wants an answer and, if it’s “no,” she misses that opportunity.   
   1. If she otherwise prefers PP, what concern might she have about whether a deal with PP actually is final? Once PP signs their draft contract, are they committing to publish her book?  
- **Part 4: They are not obligated to publish the book**  
  * **If the book creates legal problems 🡪 That is reasonable**  
  * **“Publisher shall not be obligated to publish the work” 🡪 That is unreasonable**

  2. Continuing with the issue in part “a”--that is, PP’s obligation to publish the book–why do you think PP has structured the contract in this way? What change should Barbara try to get? What argument should she make to justify it?  
- **What is publisher’s justification for this?:**  
  * **If they become insolvent**  
    * **Author won’t agree to this. They are making a commitment**  
  * **If the book comes back very different, then we want to walk away**

- **Author: Okay, so add “if the manuscript materially diverges from the proposal, then publisher has no obligation to publish.”**  
  * There are a lot of situations where you need to read deeply into the K to understand what you are getting and if the things you thought you were getting are guaranteed

- **Aspects to Being a Lawyer:**  
  * 1\) Big picture concept of what deal should be  
  * 2\) Negotiate your way to where the deal should be and getting people on board  
  * 3\) Operationalize concept. Does the paperwork match what you are supposed to get?  
    * This goes for junior and senior lawyers  
    * All that matters are the words that you sign

# 17: Film (Vertical Integration Anti-competitive?)

- Same problems and solutions arise in different transactional settings

- Different possible explanations for vertical integration:  
  * Information/Incentive problems  
  * Anti-competitive (government position)

- SC says that this is anti-competitive behavior

- Many commentators since have argued that this was not really anticompetitive  
  * Really, these were solutions for information and incentive problems

- Can vertical integration be anti-competitive?  
  * Yes, but not necessarily. It could also be formed to solve other problems

- 3 stages all owned by one studio rejected by SC. Forced sale of exhibition  
- Didn’t ask the proper questions but it is possible that leverage in theater segment of the industry through vertical integration allowed for market power in other areas of the industry (market forfeiture)  
  * If you own all movie theaters that could give you preferred treatment in the production phase because you can get only your movies into theaters while disfavoring competitors’ movies in production phase  
- Vertical integration being anti-competitive is possible but not as readily evident as horizontal integration  
  * This theory (Vertical integration being anti-competitive) assumes market concentration in at least one phase of the industry (which could be accomplished through horizontal integration)

1. A trust dominated the motion picture industry in its early years until about 1915\. (The trust was dissolved in 1917.)   
   1. Why was it sometimes called the “Edison trust”?  
- They held Edison’s invention patents for the intellectual property for making/showing movies  
  * Invented the movie projector

  2. What was the source of the trust’s leverage? What was the key source of value in the industry in those early years?  
- It controlled all aspects of the movie-making supply chain

  3. The trust prohibited the identification of actors and actresses in those early years. Why?  
- So that they could not be identified, become famous, and demand higher salaries

- The value-add of a movie was the big screen technology (not the plot or cast like today)

  4. What other constraint did it impose on movies being made at the time? Why? Was this assessment about the potential audience for motion pictures more plausible then than it is now?  
- It limited the length of films to one and two reels (10 to 20 minutes) because movie audiences were believed incapable of enjoying longer entertainment  
- This may have been more plausible at the time because movies were more boring. They were black and white, no sound

  5. The trust was based in New York and on the east coast of the U.S. Where is the film industry in the U.S. located? Is there any causal connection here?  
- Hollywood is the current film industry location. Actors and filmmakers left NY to go to Hollywood to escape some of the Trust’s dominant east coast influence

2. Three Phases in Producing a Motion Picture  
   1. What is “production”?  
- Production \= The act of making the film

  2. What is “distribution”?  
- Distribution \= Studio selling film to theaters

  3. What is “exhibition”?  
- Exhibition \= Theaters showing the movie

3. The “Studio Era”  
   1. Between 1915 and 1948, movies were made in what is called the “studio era.” What was its defining feature?  
- This era was dominated by the same company who controlled the entire industry from production to exhibition

  2. What event marked the end of the studio era?  
- *Paramount* case which broke up the fully vertically integrated company. Court said that studios could no longer own the exhibition phase too

  3. What is “vertical integration”?  
- Vertical Integration \= Different phases of production are owned by the same company  
  * The studios controlled all aspects of the supply chain from production to exhibition  
  * But studios still competed with each other

- Horizontal Integration \= Competitors merging (Companies at the same stage of production joining forces)

4. *Paramount*

   Note: In arguing that the moving picture industry violated the antitrust laws, the government invoked both its ownership structure and some of its practices. This class focuses on the ownership structure; the next unit focuses on the other unique practices.

   1. There are three groups of defendants. How does the first group (the only one charged on this issue of the case) differ from the other two?  
- The first group of defendants are companies that produce motion pictures, distribute films, **and own/control theaters (full integration)**  
  * The owning/controlling of theaters separates this group of defendants from the others

  2. What did the government allege about this group of defendants?  
- The government said that the first group of defendants conspired to and did restrain and monopolize interstate trade in the exhibition of motion pictures in most of the larger cities of the country because of the combination of owning each stage of movie industry. This violated the Sherman Act regulating antitrust laws

  3. According to the district court, did any of the defendants individually wield enough market power to have a national monopoly? Was this finding important to the Supreme Court (“the Court”)?  
- District Court: No national monopoly  
- SC: Doesn’t matter if there is no national monopoly  
  * “It is, therefore, not enough in determining the need for divestiture to conclude with the District Court that none of the defendants was organized or has been maintained for the purpose of achieving a "national monopoly," nor that the five majors through their present theatre holdings "alone" do not and cannot collectively or individually have a monopoly of exhibition.”

  4. What percentage of all theaters in the U.S. did the defendants control? Does that seem like enough to dictate prices and other terms?  
- They owned 17 percent of the theaters but held a significant amount of the theater revenues  
  * 17 percent is probably not enough to dictate prices and other terms

  5. The Court observes that the defendants had more market power in a subset of the exhibition market. Which subset was that? Did the Court consider this important?  
- However, even though they only controlled 17 percent of the total market, they had more influence over first-run theaters. They had a bigger presence over these and over major cities  
  * In first-run theaters and major cities, the studios controlled much more

- There was still competition in first-run theaters. You can wait until the movie gets to a non-first-run theater and buy a cheaper ticket

  6. Is there competition within this subset of theaters?  
- Yes. There were multiple studios competing with each other and they were competing even within the first-run theater subset  
  * There wasn’t a lot of fact-finding in this opinion

  7. Is vertical integration illegal per se? What is the Court’s test for determining when it violates the antitrust laws?  
- **Vertical integration is not per se illegal**  
- The Court’s test is: In the opinion of the majority the legality of vertical integration under the Sherman Act turns on (1) the purpose or intent with which it was conceived, or (2) the power it creates and the attendant purpose or intent.  
  * **1\) Were the companies trying to gain control**  
  * **2\) Were the companies able to do that**

  8. What kind of evidence does the Court invoke? Is the Court reviewing evidence of *the effects* of the defendants’ market power?  
- **The Court only talks about the percentage of ownership (no concrete evidence) – the collective percentage of all 5\. They don’t concentrate at all on an individual company’s stronghold**  
- **They make no effort to show that the 17 percent stronghold translated to impact on prices or quantities**

  9. Had the district court held that the defendants had to sell their theaters? Did the Supreme Court affirm the district court on this issue?  
- No, the district court did not talk at all about D selling theaters  
- The Supreme Court made this theory up instead of remanding

  10. The Court says that courts should consider the defendants’ intent (what they meant to do), and it also says that monopoly power can be illegal “though it remains unexercised.” Is there any tension between these two assertions?  
- **The tension between these two statements is that it is hard to figure out what D’s intent is without any evidence of how they acted**  
  * **This decision of concluding that vertical integration is anti-competitive transformed the industry**

  11. Would you say that the Court’s analysis is economically sophisticated? For example, how does it compare with Andrew Hanssen’s analysis in the article assigned for today?  
- Unsophisticated

  12. The U.S. government has a track record of bringing antitrust actions against companies that are on the verge of confronting a formidable new competitor (e.g., IBM and Microsoft). What new entertainment platform was emerging in the late 1940s in the U.S.?  
- Televisions. Rare in 1940’s to have TV but popular in 1950’s  
  * Government was oblivious to the fact that there was a new competitor on the rise

5. Can Vertical Integration Be Anti-competitive?  
   1. Why might it be in the interest of movie producers to limit the number of movies that are made?  
- Lowering the supply, increases the demand  
  * The most straightforward way to limit the amount of movies is to do horizontal integration – this definitely can be anti-competitive (one company buys its competitors and can control price and quantity through dominating one phase of production)  
  * But it is not as obvious that vertical integration is anti-competitive

  2. Assume that the profit-maximizing number of new movies released each year is 250, that there are five movie production companies, and that you are the head of one of them. Assume also (counterfactually) that the law does not prevent you from striking a deal with the other four CEOs, so that each of you commit to make only 50 movies each year, keeping the total at 250\. If the other four CEOs honor the agreement, is it better for you also to honor it? If you have the ability to “cheat” and secretly make and sell another five movies, would it be in your interest to do so?  
- Just like how one company that controls the market could set quantity and price, a small enough number of companies can set quantity and price if they collude with each other – both are illegal

- It is not better to honor the agreement because it would be in one company’s interest to cheat and release the additional movies if no one else cheats  
  * The revenue that the cheater gets will offset the decrease in price from more movies in the market  
  * **If each party has an incentive to cheat, the agreement is unstable**  
    * **Every party will see that if they cheat, others can, and that will ruin the agreement**  
  * It is better to honor the agreement because: If the other CEOs find out that you did not honor the agreement, they may cheat as well

  3. Given your answer to “b,” how easy or hard is it to strike an agreement limiting supply? How important is the ability to monitor whether everyone is keeping the agreement? How important is the ability to enforce the agreement?  
- Hard to agree to limit supply  
- Hard to monitor the agreement but very important  
- Hard to enforce the agreement but very important

- OPEC runs a cartel: They set oil prices for each company  
  * Everyone cheats so OPEC set a level a little lower than they would otherwise – it bakes cheating in  
    * **Very hard to police a cartel because it is hard to monitor and enforce against the cheater**

  4. If each studio owns some movie theaters and no one else does–so the five studios control all the movie theaters in your market–does that make it easier or harder for the five of you to monitor and enforce an agreement limiting the number of movies that are made?  
- Easier. **Enforcement and monitoring challenge of cartel**  
  * **Vertical integration could make it easier to exercise monopoly power in one part of the chain**  
  * **Studios could have limited number of movies that they made, but doing that is very hard because they all would have cheated (cartels are hard to monitor)**  
    * **But if each studio could only show movies through the theaters that it owned, then owning theaters became an enforcement mechanism for limiting the number of movies**  
      * **This is how vertical integration might have been anti-competitive**

  5. True or false: **By owning movie theaters, studios have the ability to prevent new studios (who don’t own theaters) from displaying their movies. This control over exhibition can give them added market power in production and distribution**.  
- True.  
  * **Control of one part of the production chain (of the display of the movies), could have given the studios extra market power in other parts of the production cycle**

  6. Same facts as in “b,” but there is a sixth “independent” studio, which does not own any theaters. It produces a movie that you think could be a big draw, which would fill your theaters if you agree to exhibit it. On the one hand, what incentive do you have to refuse to exhibit it? On the other hand, what incentive do you have to agree to exhibit it?  
- Incentive to not exhibit: Breaks cartel agreement  
- Incentive to exhibit: Big hit, revenue

- This is a coordination problem: Each of the partners in the cartel has incentive to limit everyone else’s production while they are incentivized to cheat and increase their own production

  7. Two prominent economists, Oliver Hart and Jean Tirole, wrote an article called “Vertical Integration and Market Forfeiture” (which is not assigned for class). They say the following: “Few people would disagree that horizontal mergers have the potential to restrict output and raise consumer prices.” Do you know what a “horizontal merger” is? Why do they say that it has this potential?  
- Horizontal Merger \= Two or more companies at the same level of supply chain merge together  
  * Fewer competitors mean more market power, making it easier for the remaining companies to control price and quantity

  8. Hart and Tirole go on to say that there is less agreement about whether vertical mergers also have the potential to restrict output and raise consumer prices “because the merger of an upstream and downstream firm, each of which controls, say, 10% of its market, does not change market shares: other firms continue to control 90% of each market.” Please explain this statement.  
- Vertical mergers do not change the number of competitors in the market. Vertical integration does not have the same effect to control price and quantity. There are still competitors competing at each stage of the market

  9. Hart & Tirole argue, though, that **vertical integration actually can help a firm with market power in one market (such as theaters) to leverage that power in another market (such as movie production).** **They say that the key to this leverage across markets, which is known as “market forfeiture, is that integration allows the upstream and downstream firms, once they merge, to share profits more effectively. In contrast, if they remain independent, they could “divert money and misrepresent profits.”** Please explain this statement.  
- **If what you are doing is vertically integrating after you already control one market, you can use control in one market segment to exert control over and defeat market power in another**

- **The companies that own theaters are more powerful than the non-theater owning companies**  
  * **They can prevent the other companies from showing other company movies in their theaters**  
- **Counter: The non-theater owning companies can just buy a theater**

- **We had vertical integration in studios until SC struck it down as anti-competitive and prevented studios from owning theaters**  
  * **SC did not ask the right economically rigorous questions**  
    * **No effects, just assumptions based on presence in markets (that wasn’t that large)**

- **Evaluating SC decision:**  
  * **Wrong Decision: Not obvious that vertical integration actually creates anti-competitive behavior because you still have competition in each market**  
  * **Right Decision: This was an attempt to dominate the industry indirectly through the market forfeiture thesis (exerting pressure from the theater segment to constrain supply and dictate price)**

  10. During the studio era, actors were salaried employees at studios–much as auto workers are salaried employes at car companies and musicians are salaried employees at orchestras. Someone on salary at Warner would not be in movies made by Fox, and vice versa. After the old system ended, this practice ended with it. Actors were hired to do a particular movie, and they stopped working exclusively for a single studio. The pay of star talent increased significantly. Could the lower salaries under the studio system have been caused by the anticompetitive effects of vertical integration?  
- Yes. **Vertical integration could have suppressed wages because through control of exhibition, companies had a lot of market power. The studios used their market power in the exhibition stage to quietly collude with each other and suppress actors’ wages, making them take smaller salaries than what they would eventually get after the studio system broke up**  
  * **You work with the talent you have and we will work with the talent we have instead of bidding/poach against each other and both pay more**  
  * **This is indirect evidence that the Court was right**

# 18: Film (Vertical Integration as Response to Information and Incentive Problems)

- Was Hollywood vertical integration anti-competitive? Or was it just an attempt to solve the information and incentive problems?  
  * Was not meant to suppress supply and drive up prices but just focus on issues that are inevitable

- If demand for movies is hard to predict, you need flexible negotiation between theater and distributor  
  * But the theater and production company have different incentives  
    * Theater: Cut the movie and move to next; Keep more revenue away from ticket price and quantity  
    * Production: Keep the movie and see if it attracts more people; Keep more revenue in ticket price and quantity  
  * When under common ownership, the differences in incentives become unimportant and the goal is to maximize overall profit without regard to which part is making the money

- Entertainment industry now relies on revenue sharing, incentive compensation

6. Demand for Specific Movies  
   1. **Sometimes a market practice exists not because (or, at least, not solely because) it gives the relevant firms market power; sometimes the practice also is efficient**. To explore whether this is the case with vertical integration, we need to dig into the economics of the industry. According to Arthur De Vany, what factors drive the demand for movies? What role does the dissemination of information play?  
- Part Imitation, Part Information  
  * Imitation: Number of people who saw it before; Level of revenue already earned  
  * Information: Word of mouth communication if the movie is good or bad

- **Early people who see the movie have a lot of influence over who else sees the movie (this is impacted by reviewers, weather, etc.)**  
  * **Makes it very difficult to know how a movie is going to do**  
    * **Pure uncertainty \= No one knows**  
    * Not asymmetric information where some people know more than others

  2. According to De Vany, what is the key moment that determines the success of a movie? Is it the opening? Or another moment?  
- Turning Point: Information from positive word of mouth and growing box office revenues confirm one another. All of the dynamics explode or wither  
  * About 4 weeks after its release

  3. According to Arthur De Vany, do the revenues from movies plot onto a standard “bell curve”? Why or why not?  
- They do not plot on a bell curve because a few blockbuster movies dominate the market so box office revenues do not converge to an average  
- **This industry lives and dies based on a small number of movies that do extremely well**  
  * **Very skewed distribution**  
- **Lots of uncertainty about how movies are going to do and uncertainty as to which are the blockbusters**

  4. Does Devany think that when a movie is being made, its chances of success are a matter of uncertainty? Or asymmetric information? What is the difference?  
- Devany thinks that success is a matter of uncertainty for movies because they need the audience to tell them if the movie is going to be a hit  
- Asymmetric information is when in deal with two parties, one has more insight so they are in a better position to make a deal. With uncertainty, neither party knows

  5. How effective does De Vany think movie producers are in predicting the success of movies? Do you think De Vany’s view is universally shared?  
- He thinks they are not effective at all because of the uncertainty  
- This view is probably not universally shared. Some producers think they are very good

- What can you do through K’s to deal with controversy in advance or afterwards

  6. Is it controversial to say that predictions about a movie’s popularity *before* it is released can never be as accurate as evidence gathered *after it already has been released*?  
- This is not that controversial a statement. Once you have the data, you can measure how a movie is doing


7. Vertical Integration as a Response to Uncertainty and Asymmetric Information  
   1. According to Hanssen, why is it important to make commitments about exhibiting a movie before the movie has been released?  
- It is important to make commitments about exhibiting a movie before the movie has been released because the schedule for the movie must be established and you need the money upfront for the budget

- **Need to make plans**  
  * **It costs you money to make the movie so need preliminary commitments**  
  * **Want a schedule of how it is going to be distributed**

  2. According to Hanssen, what is the downside of making these commitments before the movie has been released?  
- The demand for the movie is uncertain

- **On one hand you need to make some prediction to make the movie and know that it will be shown in theaters, but all the parties are aware of the fact that the demand for the movie is uncertain**  
  * **Uncertainty could limit the industry: No one is confident in the movie, pre-commitments could mean no capital for production**

  3. To balance the tradeoff Hanssen identifies, one option is to include a mechanism in the contract to shorten or lengthen the running time of a move. Why is this hard to do?  
- Adjusting the K after it has been made and enforcing it is hard because the penalties for run length would have had to compensate the injured producer without effecting the producer’s incentives regarding the ex ante quality of its films 

- **Producer and exhibitor do not have the same interest. Producer will want another chance to keep the movie in theaters. Exhibitors will want to shorten the term right away**

  4. Who has better information about the quality of the movie–the distributor or the theater owner? How reliable is this inside information?  
- Distributor   
- This is not that reliable because it is an uncertain industry

  5. Who has better information about the audience–the distributor or the theater owner? How reliable is this inside information?  
- Theater owner  
- This is not that reliable because it is an uncertain industry

  6. Hanssen argues that vertical integration avoided the need for nuanced contracts that provide for resetting the length of a movie’s run by meeting three needs. What was the first?  
- Reduced the need for film-by-film haggling by functioning as a de facto side payment, allowing vertically integrated producers to share in the surplus generated by the early replacement of their unpopular films

- **Vertical integration wasn’t about market forfeiture or concentrating market power. Instead, it solved information (uncertainty) problems:**  
  * **1\) Changes the incentive for the theater owner if owned by the producer: Both have aligned interest in showing the movie for the right amount of time (because they are the same company, if they think movie was actually bad they cut it but if they think the movie just got bad press early and will recover they give it another shot). Incentives align to maximize revenue overall**  
  * **2\) Theater owner and production company share information about knowing the movie and audience better with each other if they are vertically integrated**  
  * **3\) Economize Drafting/Transaction Costs:** **Makes the K agreement drafting between the producer and exhibitor much easier or unnecessary because now they are part of the same company**

  7. What was the second?  
- Reduced information asymmetry between producers and exhibitors that could have led to inefficiently too many or too few replacements if there was only a contractual remedy

  8. What was the third?  
- Made the informal arrangement self-enforcing, allowing theaters to swap new movies with each other

  9. To determine whether vertical integration actually was facilitating adjustments in run times, Hanssen compared the frequency of these adjustments at vertically integrated theaters with adjustments at independently owned theaters. What did he find?  
- The frequency of adjustments in run time is lower in the independent theaters than in the studio-owned theaters (vertically integrated theaters)  
  * Independent theaters were adjusting run times less often because they couldn’t reap the three benefits above  
  * **More adjustments to how long a film runs in vertically integrated theaters than independent theaters because vertically integrated theaters felt more free to maximize combined revenue and cut movies because they were on both sides of the transaction**  
  * A lot more changes in run time in vertically integrated studios because they felt more free to maximize the combined revenue because they were on both side of the transaction

  10. Once vertical integration became illegal, what else could the industry do to base run rates for a film on ex post evidence (of whether the audience actually liked it), instead of ex ante predictions (of whether they will like it once they see it)? (Hint: Does a movie have to be released everywhere at the same time?)  
- **Pre-release model: Limited release in a few big city theaters allow for measurement of success in a handful of theaters so you can be more flexible in a few cities**  
  * **Instead of making predictions of how the movie will do, you can base it on audience reactions. Then you can make agreements with the other theaters based on information you have already.** You can do a better job of predicting how the movie will do when you have audience reactions  
    * **Vertical integration eliminated the need for this. Now, without vertical integration, movies need to do pre-releases**

  11.  True or False: **Vertical integration can be a response to uncertainty and asymmetric information.**  
- True.

  12. In what other industry did we see organizations serving as a substitute for contracts?  
- **VC and movie industry: Both have too much uncertainty to rely on K’s. Instead, organize ownership to create flexibility as you learn more information**  
    
8. Providing the public with the opportunity to see movies requires cooperation from multiple parties. **A central theme of this course is that cooperation requires trust**. Since the parties have to perform their obligations at different times, the other parties have **“hold up” opportunities, which take advantage of the fact that their counterparties have already performed**. In the long-run, this strategic behavior–and, indeed, the mere possibility of it–can **undercut cooperation and reduce the supply of movies to the public**. De Vany highlights a few of these strategic opportunities.  
   1. Once the producers’ costs in making a specific movie are “sunk,” is it rational for them to accept unfavorable terms to exhibit it, so they can recover *at least some* of their costs?  
- Yes. Sunk costs cannot be recovered so if producer depends on theater to show movie, producers may need to accept cut-offs because it is better for them to get some revenue than none

  2. Could this unfavorable deal on a specific movie affect the producers’ willingness to make other movies in the future (whose costs have not yet been incurred)?  
- Yes. If the producer makes a bad deal, they will be more cautious about the making future movies  
- There is nothing sunk about the costs of your next movie

  3. True or false: **Exhibitors have a short term interest in striking very favorable terms with producers but a long term interest in keeping producers in business**.  
- True. In the short-term exhibitors have an interest to hold-up, but in the long-term, they have a mutual interest to keep the industry going

  4. Once an exhibitor has agreed to show a film, does a distributor have a short-term incentive to rent the film to other exhibitors in the neighborhood, who might compete with the exhibitor? If a distributor takes this step, could this influence the exhibitor’s willingness to exhibit the next film?  
- Yes, distributor has a short-term incentive to rent the film to more exhibitors to make more money. This will hurt the distributor’s relationship with the initial exhibitor and potentially damage the long-term interest of the indusrty  
  * **Hold up opportunities on both sides**

  5. True or false: **Distributors have a short term interest in renting the film widely, but a long-term interest in being more selective to protect their relationships with exhibitors and earn licensing income on future films**.  
- True.

- **There are short-term adverse interests (hold-up opportunities) and long-term shared interests (keep industry going). The parties need a mechanism to develop trust to not worry about the short-term adverse interests and focus on the long-term shared interest**

  6. If exhibitors share revenue with producers, do the exhibitors recoup the full benefit of keeping their theater cleaner and more attractive than other theaters? If not, could this affect their incentives to invest in the quality of their theaters?  
- Exhibitors have to share the benefit of keeping the cleaner and more attractive theater with the producers in this situation because they share royalties for the films. Therefore, they have less incentive to invest in the quality of their theaters  
  * **Another situation where there is imperfect alignment of incentives because the producers want exhibitors to have nice theaters**

  7. Distributors want exhibitors to pay on time. What leverage do they have if they only produce movies occasionally? What if they have a regular stream of product? Does it help for the parties to deal with each other regularly?  
- Distributors that only produce movies occasionally have less leverage with exhibitors than they would if they produced a regular product stream because the exhibitors rely on them less for movies – their product  
- Repeat dealing does help the distributors create leverage because the exhibitors rely on them more and builds a historical basis to compare box office reports

- **Repeat Relationships held address these problems because they create long term interests that can take priority over the short-term interest to not deliver**

  8. True or false: **While producers, distributors, and exhibitors all have an interest in cooperating–if only because they all depend on each other–they have short-term incentives to take advantage of each other, and opportunities to do so arise because they perform their obligations at different times. As a result, creative contracting and organizational approaches are needed to maintain trust and cooperation.**  
- True.


9. Minimum Price   
   1. In the studio era, when a distributor licensed a film to an exhibitor, the license typically required the exhibitor to charge a minimum ticket price in showing the movie to the public. In *Paramount*, **the Court deemed this minimum ticket price an illegal price fixing conspiracy**: “‘a price structure is erected which regulates the licensees' ability to compete against one another in admission price,’" the Court said, quoting the district court. “That consequence seems to us to be incontestable.” Please offer a defense of the Court’s conclusion. Why might this be the case, at least in some cases?  
- Horizontal price fixing (cartel) is monopolistic practice

- Without the fixed admission price, individual exhibitor’s gain revenue from rivals by cutting the admission price. This fails to maximize the distributor’s royalty revenue  
- Also it is hard for distributors to know if exhibitors are correctly representing their box office revenue to them so they could be getting cut out of their royalty if it wasn’t fixed at a minimum price

  2. Does it strengthen or weaken the Court’s argument if it is easy for new theaters to be opened? Does De Vany say that this sort of entry was easy or hard?  
- If it is easy for new theaters to be opened, this weakens the Court’s argument because it would create more competition and make it less likely for distributors to have a monopoly  
- Opening of new theaters was relatively easy

  3. As De Vany explains, there can be other reasons for setting a minimum ticket price. Assume that Danny Distributor is looking to distribute a film in City. He is considering either licensing it exclusively to Ellen Exhibitor, or licensing it both to her and to Eddie Exhibitor. Through the license, Danny will earn 50% of ticket revenue after the exhibitor has recovered its costs.

  4. Review: why is Danny likely to license the movie for a percentage of ticket sales, rather than a fixed price?  
- Because it is hard for Danny to predict if the movie will be a hit or a bomb  
  * **Revenue sharing:** **Approximate some of the benefit you would get from vertical integration (which you can’t do) between the parties**  
    * This aligns the incentives of the producer and exhibitor again to keep the movie in the theater for the right amount of time  
    * This can help deal with uncertainty if it works

  5. What is downside of licensing only to Ellen?  
- Less people can see the movie. Two theaters have more space than Ellen’s alone. You might not capture the full market

  6. What is the risk of licensing to both Ellen and Eddie? How would specifying a minimum ticket price help address this downside? Why should the minimum price be Eddie and Ellen’s customary price?  
- By licensing to both Ellen and Eddie, Danny risks that his revenues will be cut because both licensees will cut admission prices to compete with each other  
- Minimum ticket price guarantees that Danny will collect the revenue he wants from the licensees while allowing him to distribute the film to multiple theaters  
- The minimum price being the customary price gives theaters the option to raise the price for films they think are doing well

- **Production company wants to maximize the total tickets sold, but the exhibitors don’t care about the number of tickets that other theaters sell – they are competing**  
  * **Not full alignment of incentives with exhibitors and distributor because the distributor doesn’t the exhibitors to compete. Distributor is worried that by cutting prices, exhibitors will compete with each other and drive down overall ticket revenue**  
    * **Schizer: This has an antitrust component to it (but it is the customary price for minimum price)**  
      * Also, this is assuming that there is a finite number of people who would come see the movie and a price cut would not bring in more people

- **Need revenue sharing to address the information asymmetry (uncertainty of movie)**  
  * **But the revenue sharing creates an incentive problem (price cuts)**  
  * **Setting minimum price at the customary price can help avoid the incentive problems (which could defeat the revenue sharing solution to the information problem)**


10. Assume that Danny grants an exclusive license to Ellen in exchange for 50% of ticket revenue after Ellen has recovered her costs. Ellen decides to offer tickets for $8 (instead of the usual $10) to any customer who spends at least $5 on snacks. How might this promotion disserve Danny’s interests? What condition could he specify to protect those interests?  
- Danny’s interests are disserved because consumers pay less in ticket revenue, which is shared with him, in exchange for paying more in concession revenue which is not shared with him  
- Danny should make sure that his royalty is based off of box office sales exclusive of concession revenue

- **Another divergence of incentives for exhibitor and distributor**  
  * Exhibitor only keeps half of ticket profit but keeps full profit on concessions. So she wants to sell concessions and shift revenue from tickets to concessions  
  * **Incentive Problem:** Distributor could look to get in on the concession revenue too, but exhibitor won’t agree because distributor didn’t produce the popcorn. Instead, **distributor should require a minimum ticket price to prevent discounts that divert money from tickets (distributor sharing in revenue) to concessions (distributor not sharing in revenue)**  
- **The minimum ticket price is not about anti-competitive behavior and overcharging the public. Instead, it is a way to prevent cheating (incentive problems) that come from revenue sharing which is there because of uncertainty/information problem**

11. Assume again that Danny grants an exclusive license to Ellen in exchange for 50% of ticket revenue after Ellen has recovered her costs. If Ellen is unscrupulous enough to report dishonest numbers as a way to keep more of the ticket revenue, what are the two numbers she might understate. How, if at all, does a minimum ticket price help to protect Danny?  
- Exhibitor will report less in quantity of tickets sold and less in price of tickets sold  
- **A minimum ticket price protects distributor by guaranteeing that at least one of these numbers, the price of tickets will not drop below a certain rate**

12. Clearance  
    1. What is “clearance”?  
- **Clearance was a commitment from distributor to exhibitor to protect the play date from rival showings of the picture**  
  * If you have three theaters in a neighborhood, you don’t want them all showing the same movie

  2. Danny is negotiating a license with Ellen. Erik has just opened another theater down the street from Ellen, and he also wants a license. Danny offers Ellen the license to exhibit the movie first, and is willing to commit not to let Erik have a license during the first two weeks.  
     1. The Court said that clearances are not per se illegal. “A clearance when used to protect that interest of the exhibitor was reasonable,” the Court explained, referencing the district court’s conclusion, “when not unduly extended as to area or duration.” Under this standard, is the clearance Danny proposed above acceptable?  
- This clearance is acceptable  
  * Protects exhibitor  
  * Only 2 weeks

- **Court did not think that clearance was pre se anti-competitive, but they were skeptical of clearances that were consistently given or given for a large number of movies at one time**

  2. What if Danny offers the same clearance for ten consecutive movies? The Court expressed suspicion about “the clearances . . . in vogue,” which “had . . . acquired a fixed  and uniform character and were made applicable to situations without regard to the special circumstances which are necessary to sustain them as reasonable restraints of trade.” Do you think the Court would view the multi-movie license to Ellen as violating the antitrust laws?  
- Yes, the Court would think that a clearance for ten movies violated antitrust laws because they have a fixed and uniform character and would go beyond what is necessary

  3. Please defend the multi-movie clearance provision. Are there reasons why the clearance in a particular place should remain the same for essentially every movie? Does De Vany think this is evidence of anti-competitive motives?  
- The clearance helped to maximize the distributor’s royalty because it ordered exhibitors as to when they could show the film. The largest and highest priced theaters would pay more for the first runs of the film  
- De Vany thinks that clearances allowed distributors and exhibitors to build trust and reputation with each other and were not anti-competitive  
  * **If there is a reason that the distributor decided on the exhibitor for one movie and liked them, there are reasons to believe that they would want to work with them again which are not anti-competitive**

    4. Although the same clearance might be specified ex ante for different movies, is the “run” for each certain to be the same? Why or why not? Should this be relevant to the antitrust analysis?  
- Even if the same clearance was specified, the run times changes because the run time depended on the success of the film with the audience  
- This is relevant to an antitrust analysis because it is evidence that the distributors were not actually engaging in anticompetitive behavior – only on its face did it look like that. The variable run times allowed for new entrants  
  * **Getting the clearance wasn’t that great because it was regularly renegotiated**

    5. Ellen licenses one of Danny’s movies, *All the President’s Dogs*, for a three week “first run.” The license also specifies that she will continue to show the movie for another two weeks if the average daily box office total in the third week exceeds $30,000. Ellen has another license to show another movie, *The Phantom Matrix*, starting in three weeks. If the first movie meets its “holdover” target, how does Ellen work out her conflicting commitment to two different movies? What was the market practice in the Studio era?  
- During the Studio era, exhibitors showed the movies of one distributor because of the clearances, so exhibitors would keep showing the successful movie despite being obligated to show the new one, but both parties would want that  
  * **Vertical integration aligns incentives: The studios just want to maximize revenue for each movie, and this is what the theater cared about too (because they were owned by the studio). They don’t care which movie is being played as long as it is successful**  
    * **Make adjustments later**

- **Clearances: Distributor says to exhibitor we want to work with you on the next 10 movies. Justifications:**  
  * **Anti-competitive rationale: You are shutting out other theaters from access to these next movies**  
  * **Reputation: If distributor likes exhibitor for one, they will like them for the next 9**  
  * **Incentive Problem Solving: If distributor owns the theater, the re-negotiation of run times after the K is made is a lot easier**  
    * **They will be on the same page with how long to run each movie because they want to maximize revenue. There won’t be another commitment to bring in a different movie from a different studio that they have to abide by. If there is a big hit, let that ride and push the other movies out**

    6. We have discussed why clearance policies are good for Danny and Ellen. Why are they also good for the viewing public?  
- **Clearances provided more variety of films for the public to see.** This is because when a distributor limits the number of theaters exhibiting one of its films, there are more available theaters to show films. If they didn’t limit the distribution to a few exhibitors, the exhibitors would all want to show the same top hits  
    
13. Formula Deals and Franchises  
    1. Ellen owns fifteen theaters across the country, while Eddie and Erik each own only one theater. Danny offers Ellen a more favorable deal, giving her discretion to choose which of her theaters should display his films (a “blanket deal”). Danny gives Ellen a license for all his movies for more than one season (a “franchise”). Ellen’s royalty is based on ticket sales nationally, not just in the specific theater showing the movie (a “formula deal”). The Court invalidated these contractual terms as “devices for stifling competition and diverting the cream of the business to the large operators.” What do you think troubled the Court?  
- Danny wants to make a deal with Ellen because she has a better chance to make the movie successful with her multiple theaters than can reach more audiences. She can gather the information from the audience that tells if the movie is a success or not and adapt her exhibition accordingly. Danny should want to cut her these favorable terms because he will make more money this way too  
- Court is concerned that large theater chains reduce competition (bigness dictates prices)

  2. Are there other explanations for these contractual terms? Specifically, why is it advantageous both to Ellen and to Danny for Ellen to have discretion about which movie to show?  
- Yes. Both Ellen and Danny want Ellen to have discretion over which movie to show so that she will show the successes and cut the bombs

- **This is similar to vertical integration: Parties just care about all of the theaters making the maximum amount of money so the distributor gives the exhibitor a few movies (blanket deal) in order for exhibitor to best use her knowledge of the audiences and put them in the best-fit theaters so they make the most money on the whole**  
  * If we can’t have vertical integration, we can simulate it

  3. What is the advantage to Ellen and Danny in basing the royalty on national ticket sales, instead of sales in her theaters?  
- Basing the royalty on national sales allows the exhibitor to move the movie around in its different theaters to maximize its revenue

- **Minimum ticket price regulates the price aspect of the cheating the theater owner could do under revenue sharing**  
- **National number regulates the quantity aspect of the cheating the theater owner could do under revenue sharing**  
  * **Instead of having a theater specific count, they used a national number because it is harder to falsify this**


14. Blind Selling and Block Booking  
    9. Danny and Ellen sign a licensing agreement for a movie that has not been produced yet. As a result, Ellen obviously cannot see the movie before committing to exhibit it. The Court expressed concern that this was a sign that the market was not sufficiently competitive: “By this practice a distributor could promise a picture of good quality or of a certain type which when produced might prove to be of poor quality or of another type \-- a competing distributor meanwhile being unable to market its product and in the end losing its outlets for future pictures.” Is there another reason why Danny wants to line up licenses for a movie before it is made?  
- **Blind selling allowed the exhibitor to get a reliable stream of films lined up and it ensured that the distributors had the money in advance to make the movies**

  10. Danny offers Ellen a license not just for a single movie, but for all forty movies that Danny plans to distribute in the coming year. The Court disallowed “block booking” contracts, viewing them as “devices for stifling competition and diverting the cream of the business to the large operators.” Instead, the Court required the contract to allow Ellen to reject any film she did not want. What do you think was the Court’s concern?  
- Court was concerned that producers were forcing exhibitors to lock into contracts where they had to buy bad movies to get the good ones  
  * Viewed as anti-competitive

  11. Assume that Film A is expected to be really popular and Film B is of much lower quality. In principle, the distributor might try to use her leverage through Film A–something everyone wants–to force exhibitors to take Film B as well. But isn’t there a more straightforward way for the distributor to take advantage of the popularity of Film A? Why not just do that?  
- Producers could just raise the price or royalty rate on Film A  
  * You don’t need to sell them as a package to take advantage of bargaining power you might have  
  * Schizer: Economic nativité

  12. There are other explanations for block booking, aside from the anticompetitive one that concerned the Court. Why might it be helpful both to Danny and to Ellen to license a block of movies, instead of licensing one at a time?  
- **Block booking: Allowed parties to economize and lower transactions costs. Making movies available together means you don’t have to do as much individual negotiating**  
  * **Further, if it is hard to predict the hits, then no one really knows, and you should just sell the whole package as a group because no one can really tell what is a good or bad movie at the outset**

Recap:

- Looked at old structure of entertainment industry. Pattern is vertical integration and related practices  
  * Looked at anti-competitive explanations that caused them to be illegal  
  * Looked at other explanations that should not be illegal  
- Next, look at modern practices that have addressed information and incentive problems which has kept the industry going

# 19: Film (Bargaining Power, Gross-Up, Profits Interest)

- Fundamental problems of information and incentives arise in every business setting  
- Key challenge for transactional lawyers:  
  * 1\) Identify incentive/information problems  
  * 2\) What tools can you use to address the information/incentive problems  
    * Depending on the kind of incentive/information problem, there are some tools that are better or worse  
    * In so many situations a tool used to address the initial problem begets a new problem

- Exam:  
  * Focus of Discussion Questions  
  * Not facts/details/obscure legal doctrines  
  * It is about information/incentive problems  
    * Spot them before they arise  
    * Know how to deal with them  
      * The real value of a lawyer is the recommendation to refine transactions  
  * Hypothetical business situations where you see the problems and make recommendations  
    * Offer thoughts and how to address them  
  * 3 Hours  
  * Open laptop but no internet/downloading

- **Profit sharing agreements are not written to be accurate reflection of whether a movie is profitable**  
  * **Net profits interest** (name doesn’t tell you the features – Batfilm)  
    * **Undercounts revenue and overcounts costs**  
    * Parties don’t do as well as if they were genuine partners  
  * Sophisticated party transactions/contracts are not overruled by courts  
    * Judges do not read intent into the K  
    * Courts will not overrule a K because it is unfair  
    * Court’s job is to just enforce the bargain  
      * **If courts get involved in re-writing K’s predictability in business is lowered and transactions are chilled for fear that they will be overruled**  
      * No implied duty of good faith in sophisticated transactions  
    * Like the bus K case

  * **Gross Profits Interest** (generous)  
    * **Limited subtractions, generous revenue calculation**

- **Why do these two interests exist? Why does one person get one and not the other?**  
  * Because some do not have the bargaining power so studios stick them with net profits interest?  
    * **But bargaining power infuses the entire transaction. You can use it in many kinds of ways**  
      * **You could still get a gross profits interest but just a much lower percentage or something like that**  
- Need to understand why specific terms might make sense/not make sense

- **Two versions of why some people get net and not gross:**  
  * **Goldberg: Incentives**  
  * **Weinstein: This is about risk spreading**

1. *George Lucas and Bargaining Power.* After the *Paramount* decision put an end to “the studio era,” contracts allowing talent to participate in the studio’s profits became more common. Before we turn to the standard contracts, let’s start with an arrangement that was unusual: George Lucas’s contract with Twentieth Century Fox to make *Star Wars.* (Some answers are not in the reading.)  
1. Initially, Lucas had a contract to make two movies. What were they? How much was he going to get paid for the second movie? What happened to give him more bargaining power?  
- Lucas had K to make *American Graffiti* and *Star Wars*  
  * Studio wanted *American Graffiti* and Lucas wanted *Star Wars*  
    * *American Graffiti* is successful and gives him more bargaining power

2. What did his agent suggest as a way to use this bargaining power? What did he do instead?  
- His agent wants to re-negotiate for more salary  
  * Lucas instead uses his bargaining power to ask for other things – opportunity  
    * 1\) Merchandising right  
    * 2\) Maintain rights to sequels  
  * **If there are things that matter to you that do not matter to the other side, snap them up in negotiation**  
    * **You also need to identify what things these might be**  
    * **People do not always use bargaining power for a better price term**

3. Why was the studio willing to accept his suggestion?  
- Merchandising: Yes. A recent movie flopped on merchandising so studio was willing to give that to him  
- Sequel Rights: Studio didn’t like the movie concept to begin with so was fine to give that away too

4. How did Lucas’s deal compare with the deals struck by other successful writers and directors? Was Lucas’s main motivation money or something else in making this deal?  
- One of the two wealthiest people in Hollywood (Oprah because she has been compensated outside of her services)

5. Was Lucas able to negotiate a similar deal when he and Steven Spielberg teamed up to make *Raiders of the Lost Arc*? Why or why not?  
- Studio did not give the same concessions because they got burned by the first deal

6. Coda: Media reports suggest that Lucas turned out to be disillusioned with the deal–not the money he received, but something else (which arguably was even more important to him). Do you know what his concern was? (This is not in the reading).  
- Disney did not commit to use his three remaining storylines (he made 9 movies but only the first six he made)  
  * Last three were supposed to be Leila’s story

2. *Batfilm Prod. v. Warner Brothers*  
   1. The more common deal is not the one between Lucas and Twentieth Century Fox, but the one litigated in *Batfilm*. What role did the plaintiffs play in the movie that is the subject of this ligitation?  
- P’s thought that someone would want to make the rights to make the Batman movie so they negotiated for the rights from comic book and then sold them to the studio

  1. What fixed compensation did plaintiffs get? What contingent compensation was offered to them? What was the dispute about?  
- Yes. They were entitled to $300K which they were paid plus a net profit’s interest in the movie (which wound up being worthless)  
  * They were supposed to get 13% of net profits but the way net profits was defined in the K they got nothing even though the movie was successful  
  * They brought suit to say that the K is unfair

  2. Is the court willing to consider whether the contract is fair? Does the court think that this approach is well suited to the plaintiffs in this case?  
- A K is not unconscionable just because it is not fair. It is what you agreed to  
- **Hollywood Accounting: Net profits was defined in a precise way that diverged from the way profits of the movie were in reality**

  3. What doctrine is the court applying? What defense does the court offer for the approach it is applying? What does the court say is at stake for the motion pictures industry? Do you agree?  
- P’s were evoking the doctrine of unconscionability. We got nothing from this profitable movie  
- Court: Too bad. **You are senior movie studio executives. You are a sophisticated party that got what you signed**  
  * **Honor the K to ensure predictability in industry**

- **Unconscionability is normally used when there is a consumer K (unsophisticated party)**  
  * Not a true bargain between people where there is total unequal bargaining power

  4. This excerpt of the opinion considers only some of the plaintiffs’ claims. What is “overhead”? What was the plaintiffs’ complaint about it? What did the court conclude?  
- **Overhead \= Percentage based fee that studio charges to cover costs regarding rent, utilities, CEO pay, management pay**  
  * **Not allocated budget for a particular movie (camera or actor)**

- **P’s claimed that Warner Brothers charged excessive overhead costs which reduced their net profits**  
  * **Overhead was a defined percentage term in the K (15%)**  
    * P is saying that is not really what it cost  
    * But court does not care. It was a defined term. It was unfavorable to you but that is too bad. You signed it. No ambiguity

  5. Assume for the moment that 15% is too high an estimate of “true” overhead, which really is more like 5%. Does this matter? If the parties understand that 15% overstates the studios costs–and thus makes it harder to reach the net profit break-even point–then isn’t this just the deal the parties agreed to strike? Is judicial intervention required here?  
- If a term is unreasonable, judicial intervention would not be permissible still  
  * They could have specified a term as anything and this is what court would have gone with  
  * It is a term in the K so the parties must follow it

  6. What was the plaintiffs’ complaint about videocassette royalties? What did the court conclude?  
- P’s say the 15% royalty used to calculate net profit understated actual home video revenue  
  * Court upheld it as consistent with the K  
- **Overstatement of costs, understatement of home-showing revenue decreased the net profit margin**  
  * **It might be inaccurate, but it was defined in the K to be computed in this way**

  7. Given the contract’s treatment of videocassette royalties, is “net profit” under the contract an accurate measure of a movie’s profitability? Would accountants produce the same number in the profits they report to shareholders?  
- Net profit is an inaccurate measure of a movie’s profitability

  8. In light of your answer to “i,” is it possible for a movie to be very profitable, but for a writer or director with a “net profits” clause to receive no royalty under the clause?  
- **It is possible for a movie to be very profitable, but for a writer or director with a “net profits” clause to receive no royalty under the clause**

2. Terminator 3  
   1. Let’s compare Arnold Schwarzenneger’s contract in Terminator 3 with the contracts in *Batfilm*? Obviously, Schwarzenneger’s minimum compensation was a lot higher. How much was it?  
- Schwarzenneger had a pay to play K (even if they didn’t make the movie he was going to get this money)  
  * Minimum of $29.25M

  2. In addition, his contingent contract also was structured differently. What was the key difference?  
- He received a percentage of adjusted gross receipts after the cash breakeven point for the movie 

- **There are 2 Kinds of profit interests:**  
  * **1\) Net profit: Not very likely to generate a payment**  
  * **2\) Gross profit: Very likely to generate a payment**

  3. Why did Schwarzenneger have so much bargaining power in this deal?  
- There is a video game with Schwarzenneger in it and so the people financing the deal, banking on the video game to make the Terminator franchise money, required Schwarzenneger be in it  
  * Even though the first two movies didn’t sell very well, Schwarzenneger had massive bargaining power

  4. What nonfinancial benefits did the contract give Schwarzenneger? Did he have any creative control?  
- He also had some control over the production

  5. What percentage of receipts did he get after the movie reached the cash “break even” point?  
- 20% of gross receipts from all global markets after the cash breakeven point

  6. Please answer the following questions, applying the contract’s definition of “cash breakeven”: 

     *Cash Breakeven shall be defined as the point at which there shall have been recouped from Adjusted Gross Receipts an amount equaling all actual distribution expenses attributable to the Picture (provided there shall be no double deductions for any item, including without limitation residuals), all costs of production of the Picture (including without limitation any pre-break participations, mutually-approved deferments and completion bond fee), actual interest and actual financing costs related to the Picture, a producer fee in the aggregate amount of $5,000,000 for Andy Vajna and Mario Kassar and an overhead charge to Intermedia Film Equities Limited equal to ten percent (10%) of the bonded budget (with no interest on overhead or overhead on interest). For purposes of calculating Cash Breakeven only, Adjusted Gross Receipts shall include a 100% home video royalty (i.e. home video revenues less costs, provided no such costs shall be deducted if such costs were previously deducted hereunder) to the extent that Producer is accounted by distributors at a 100% home video royalty or if Producer is not accounted for at a 100% home video royalty, with respect to any Adjusted Gross Receipts, such Adjusted Gross Receipts shall include and be calculated with a home video royalty equal to the home video royalty Producer receives with respect to such Adjusted Gross Receipts, but in no event less than a 35% home video royalty. For all other purposes (other than calculating Cash Breakeven), including the calculation of \[Schwarzenegger\] Participation and the Deferred Participation, Adjusted Gross Receipts shall include a 35% home video royalty, or if the agreement for the services of the director of the Picture so provides, then such greater home video royalty shall be included in the Adjusted Gross Receipts of the Picture for purposes of calculating \[Schwarzenegger\] Participation and the Deferred Participation.*

     1. What expenses are subtracted from adjusted gross receipts to calculate cash breakeven for Schwarzenneger?  
- To calculate gross receipts, subtracting not that many expenses:  
  * Subtract actual distribution expenses  
  * Subtract costs of production  
  * Subtract actual interest and financing costs  
  * Subtract producer fees  
  * No double counting (standard Hollywood accounting procedure)  
    * **Subtractions are minimal and accurate in gross receipts**

- Net profits interest undercounts revenue and overcounts expenses (bigger overhead than there actually was etc.)

  2. In calculating the breakeven point for Schwarzenneger, what percentage of receipts from home video royalties are included in “adjusted gross receipts”? How does this compare with the analogous provision in *Batfilm*?  
- Batfilm: Include a small percentage of the home viewing revenue  
- Schwarzenneger: Include 100 percent of home video revenues less costs  
  * Minimum inclusion of 35%  
    * **Gross profits interest is a much more generous formula (accurate revenue and cost analysis)**

    

  7. What is the purpose of the following provision in Schwarzenneger’s contract?:  
       
     *A. Contractor and Artist have entered into an Actor Loanout Agreement dated as of Jun 6, 2001 (the "Agreement") pursuant to which, inter alia, Artist is rendering acting services in connection with the production of that certain feature length motion picture tentatively entitled "Terminator 3" (the "Picture").*  
       
     *B. A portion of the services of Artist to be provided under the Agreement may be rendered outside the United States.*  
- Schwarzenneger did not want to make the movie outside of CA or U.S. because he would have to be taxed in all of these different jurisdictions

- Protecting him from foreign tax liabilities with a **Tax Gross Up:**   
  * **After-tax position is as if he had worked in CA the whole time**

    *C. As a material inducement to Artist to enter into the Agreement, and in partial consideration of the performance of services thereunder, Contractor has agreed to reimburse Artist on a fully "grossed up" basis for the payment of any taxes (including, without limitation, income tax, social security tax, payroll taxes and other social charges, the value added tax and any penalties and interest on any of such taxes) to any foreign country or subdivision thereof imposed on Artist by reason of Artist's rendering of services to Contractor in any foreign country under the Agreement (the "Subject Taxes"), all on the terms and subject to the provisions more particularly set forth hereinbelow.*  
      
    *D. The parties' intention in entering into this Tax Reimbursement Agreement is to put Artist in the same economic after-tax position as Artist would have been in had all of Actor's services under the Agreement been performed solely in California through a U.S. "loanout" corporation, and this Tax Reimbursement Agreement shall be interpreted consistent with that intention.*  
      
  8. Assume that Schwarzenneger becomes subject to a foreign tax of $100,000. To achieve the purpose in “D” above, why is it not enough to pay Schwarzenner an additional $100,000?  
- It is not enough to just pay Schwarzenneger for the tax he owes because he will have to pay taxes on the additional money you give him to reimburse the tax 

  9. Assume the foreign tax is not deductible and that the combined federal and state tax rate is 50%. How much additional compensation must Schwarzenneger receive to make him whole for this tax?  
- $200K

  10. **To make a taxpayer whole for a tax of X, the taxpayer must receive a payment of X/(1-T), where T is the taxpayer’s marginal tax rate**.

  11. Schwarzenneger’s “gross up” also included a payment for the following: “the amount of any professional fees and costs incurred by Artist to obtain foreign tax advice in connection with the Picture, if any.” If you were his lawyer, and you were trying to make the case for this term, what would you say?  
- He wants to make the movie in CA. You are making him fly everywhere to make the movie. **Because he is traveling and has to pay tax in these other jurisdictions, you have to compensate him for the advice he has to get to pay all the local taxes**

  12. What is the purpose of the following provision? Do you think it was included at the request of the studio or of Scharzenneger?:  
      *“In computing the Reimbursement Amount, all allowable exemptions, credits, deductions and offsets against the Subject Taxes shall be taken into account . . . . The Reimbursement Amount shall not include any amounts solely and directly resulting from actions or omissions on the part of Artist (except to the extent such actions or omissions are undertaken (or not undertaken, as the case may be) consistent with the Tax Reimbursement Agreement, with the Agreement or with the prior written approval of Contractor).”*  
- **The studio is including this to ensure that Schwarzenegger is on the hook for mistakes/errors in his tax planning**  
  * They will only gross him up for taxes that he actually owes after engaging in reasonable tax planning. If you overpay, that is on you

- 2 Types of Compensatory Revenue Sharing  
  * 1\) Net (bad)  
  * 2\) Gross (good)

3. Introducing Two Types of Participations: Net & Gross  
   1. Revenue is being divided—but which revenue? To begin answering this question consider the following example: Art writes the script for *Big Hit*. In return, he got a fee of $50,000 plus a net participation. Assume for all the following questions that Art’s net participation is fairly standard. Ticket sales in theaters for *Big Hit* were $100 million.  
      1. To compute net participations, the first step is to start with “adjusted gross receipts.” Whose receipts are we talking about? Will this be $100 million or something else?  
- **Gross receipts \= Studio’s Receipts after the cuts to the exhibitors**  
  * $50M of the $100M is the starting point (just revenue sharing with the studio’s cut of the total revenue)

    2. Home video revenue for *Big Hit* was $50 million. If Art’s contract is a standard one, will that be included in “adjusted gross receipts”?  
- **Gross receipt percentage for home video is 20%**  
- Starting amount of actor’s cut is $60M  
  * 20%($50M) \= $10M  
  * 50%($100M) \= $50M

  2. Theater versus Home Viewing  
     1. Scarlett is the star of *Black Spider*, which was supposed to be released in theaters in May of 2020, but the release date was delayed for over a year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Eventually, Studio releases Black Spider simultaneously in domestic theaters (where it grosses $80 million in its first weekend) and also on its “Studio+” streaming channel (where it grosses $60 million in its first weekend). Scarlett sues Studio, arguing that her contract specified a release exclusively in theaters. Why do you think she cares about this? What is at stake for her?  
- This matters to Scarlet because the decision to release in other platforms, means that her theater revenue is lessened which she gets a bigger cut of (than home video revenue)  
  * **Actor does not share in the theater revenue the same amount as the home video revenue**

- **K’s are set to maximize the incentives of the people who are relevant at a given moment to make as much money as possible for the overall venture**  
  * **Actor can do a lot more to get people to see the theatrical release through their publicity than they can for a home video release**  
    * Motivate the talent to publicize/advertise the movie as part of the marketing plan for theatrical release (but doesn’t apply to home revenue) by giving her a cut of the theatrical release

    2. This is based on a real case, which was settled on very favorable terms for one of the parties. Which party do you think that was?  
- **By opening at home at the same time as theaters, studio took advantage of her marketing effort and diverted some of the theatrical revenue which she got a part of to the home video release which she did not**

  3. Gross versus Net  
     1. Let’s return to *Big Hit*. The star of this movie, Barbara, receives a “gross participation.” How is this different from Art’s net participation?  
- Gross is better than net because it factors in more revenue and less deductions

  2. There are various costs in making *Big Hit*. Which of the following is subtracted before Barbara’s “gross” is computed? What about Art’s “net”?  
     1. Studio pays $X to the director as fixed compensation.  
- Gross: Subtracted  
- Net: Subtracted

  2. Studio takes a distribution fee equal to 30% of receipts.  
- Gross: Subtracted  
- Net: Subtracted

  3. Advertising expenses.  
- Gross: Not subtracted  
- Net: Subtracted

  3. Barbara, the star of the movie, has a gross participation deal. Assume it’s a “first dollar” gross deal, and that she’s supposed to get 10% of the adjusted gross and she receives a $5 million advance. How much must the adjusted gross be in order for her to get more than her advance?  
- Advance: Payment you get up-front  
  * Movie has not made any money yet  
  * This is guaranteed. If the movie does not make enough to generate the $5M, she still gets the advance  
- She can earn more than her $5M advance if her movie earns more than $50M  
  * $51M 🡪 She gets $5.1M total (an additional $100K on top of the advance)

  4. Accuracy  
     1. Can *Big Hit* be very profitable from the perspective of the studio’s shareholders, but still not generate a “gross” profit participation for Barbara?  
- **Gross profit participation is meant to generate a lot of money regardless of how the movie does (even if the movie doesn’t turn out to be as profitable as everyone hoped it would)**

  2. True or false: ***Big Hit*** **can be very profitable from the perspective of the studio’s shareholders, but still not generate a “net” profit participation for Art**.  
- Net profit participations are not accurate, not generous to those who have them  
  * Income is understated, costs are overstated  
    * **If someone works on a movie for a net profit, the movie can do very well and generate little net profit (high expense counting, low revenue counting)**

- **Why are we doing different deals for different actors?**  
  * This is carefully calibrated  
  * **Who are the people that can make the biggest difference in making the movie and when?**  
    * **Screenplay writer: Not much to do after he writes the screenplay. There is nothing more the studio wants him to do**  
    * **Actor: There is a lot more the studio wants the actor to do after making the movie (marketing)**  
      * **Keep her motivated even as the movie comes out**  
  * **Therefore, there need to be different financial instruments that incentivize people in different ways at different times**  
    * **Art is not going to play a role in getting people into theaters so he should not be paid in ticket revenue**

# 20: Film (Profits Interest: Incentives or Risk Allocation)

- Incentives in entertainment industry align with 2 ways a movie can be profitable:  
  * 1\) Gross profit: Blockbuster bring stars in model  
  * 2\) Net profit: Disciplined cost control with relatively unknown cast  
    * These are the different ways you can motivate the relevant people making the profit-maximizing decisions in that moment

- Goldberg: Best way to explain film industry K’s is that they are nuanced ways to deal with information/incentive problems

3. Information and Incentives: Studios and Theater Owners  
   1. Studio, a film distributor, is negotiating a deal to distribute a movie. Tom, who owns a theater, contracts with Studio to show the movie. Under their standard contract, does Tom pay a fixed fee to Studio for the film? Or does Studio pay a fixed fee to rent the theater? Or something else? What is the usual arrangement? According to Goldberg, what is the reason for this?  
- Theater owner does not pay a fixed fee to studio. Theater owner and studio share revenue  
  * **Goldberg says that this reflects revenue sharing model where the revenue sharing percentage changes over time**  
- This arrangement responds to the uncertainty in the demand

- **Theater owners have some control over the size of the audience depending on their investments (concessions, seat size, theater size, cleanliness)**  
  * **Given that the audience size depends on the efforts/investment of the theater owner, you want the theater to get a contingent fee to have the incentives to invest in drawing a larger crowd**  
  * **The studio is also a critical player and must be motivated to make the best possible movie and market it properly**   
- **You want to motivate both parties to generate the maximum revenue**

- **Goldberg: Revenue sharing makes sense so that the amounts they are getting are contingent on effort**   
- **Theater recovers some costs and then it is a 50-50 revenue split from there**  
  * **You want theater owner to recover basic investment so that he can invest in basic components (staff, lights, etc.)**

  1. Like other standard deals, Tom’s contract with Studio has a provision that changes over the course of a movie’s “run” in his theater. What is this change? What explanation does Goldberg offer for it? Is his explanation about information, incentives, or something else?  
- **In the early weeks of the movie’s run, the studio takes a larger percentage and the then the theater slowly takes more and more share**  
  * **Goldberg: Whose contribution is more important at a particular moment in time (and then motivate that person)? This determines who gets most of the revenue**  
    * **In the opening days, the studio is more important because of the marketing they do and the film they put together**  
      * **After the initial burst of people go, the theater starts taking more revenue because more people are going just for the experience of being at a theater**  
  * Not a constant revenue split. Starts in favor of the studio and gradually the theater owner gets a bigger and bigger share

  2. Tina, who owns a small independent theater, strikes a different deal than Studio. She will get the movie late in its run. According to Goldberg, is she likely to receive a fixed fee? Or to pay a fixed fee? Why?  
- **In a late run, Theater is paying Studio a fixed fee because the studio’s efforts are not that relevant anymore**  
  * **The contribution that the studio made is over. At the late stage, the theater is contributing more (clean theater, nice concessions is why people are going). Therefore, theater should bear all the reward/risk in getting people to come because she is in a better position to make a difference with it**

  3. Talia owns a large and luxurious theater in Big City. The studio strikes a special deal to “four wall” it for the beginning of the movie’s run. According to Goldberg, is she likely to receive a fixed fee? Or to pay a fixed fee? Why?  
- **in the early days through “Four Walling,” Theater gets a fixed fee from Studio because when a movie is just opening, the ad campaign looms disproportionately large in getting an audience. Therefore, studio wants to bear all the risk/reward because they are in the best position to make a difference attracting people**  
  * The risk should lie with the studio to get the right ad campaign and make the right movie

- As the run continues, the contribution of the theater is larger and the studio is smaller  
  * At the beginning – studio takes all of the risk/reward  
  * At the end – theater takes all of the risk/reward

  4. Franco is a foreign subdistributor. According to Goldberg, what kind of deal is he likely to strike with the studio? What are the three components of the deal?  
- Rolling breakeven arrangement for foreign subdistributors: Subdistributor pays a fixed payment based on what he expects the film to generate. He keeps all the revenue until he recoups his costs. Then he splits revenue 50/50 with the studio

- **Who is important and at what point?**  
  * **The studio’s marketing at the beginning will not be as effective in foreign places so:**  
    * **Fixed payment from subdistributor to studio (up to subdistributor to attract audiences, bear the risk/reward)**  
    * **Cost recovery to subdistributor because studio wants him to spend on getting audience**  
    * **Sharing revenue thereafter so that studio is still incentivized to make movies that appeal to foreign jurisdictions**

- **At each moment in production process, who has the comparative advantage in maximizing movie revenue?**  
  * **Then give that person a larger share at that moment** to try to motivate the person to make the best decision

  5. Why does this structure serve the parties’ interests? What effect does it have on their incentives?  
- Strike the incentives in the right way

  6. What information problem does it solve? Why does Goldberg compare it with an M\&A deal with an earnout?  
- **Blend of information and incentive problems:**  
  * **Incentive issues: Revenue sharing to make profit-maximizing decisions**  
  * **Asymmetric information: Revenue sharing signals that the studio believes in the movie**  
    * **Asymmetric information: Who knows better about this part of the market? That person should get the larger share because they know better to make the right decision**  
      

4. Incentives: Profits Interests, Writers, and Producers  
   1. Peter, a producer who works for Studio, negotiates a net profit interest with Wilma, a young screenwriter. You are a college friend of Wilma’s parents, and a Hollywood veteran. At her parents’ suggestion, Wilma meets you for coffee to ask for your advice. She asks you why Studio recovers all its costs first, so that she shares in profits only after the breakeven point.  
- **Share the revenue in a way that creates an incentives that best motivate the party to make a profit-maximizing decision. It is the same analysis for the studios negotiating with the talent**  
  1. According to Goldberg, what is the rationale for this? What incentive does it create for Studio?  
- **Studio recovers costs before she gets net profit interest because it is in writer’s interest to let the Studio overmarket**  
  * She is worried that Studio will overspend because Wilma is subsidizing them through sharing in the profits (and not taking money if they spend more). However, Wilma can only write a good script and then her work is done  
    * Giving her something contingent doesn’t make sense because she cannot do anything to make the movie more successful  
  * **Studio’s underinvestment in marketing is bad for Wilma because her reputation relies on the movie being successful which at this point is out of her hands**  
    * **She wants to send the studio a signal: Spend what you want, you come first in recovering**  
    2. Wilma asks whether Peter also gets a net profit participation, and you confirm that he probably does, given the standard contract structure in Hollywood. You also mention that Peter is likely to have an “overbudget penalty clause.” What is that? According to Goldberg, what function does the clause and Peter’s net participation serve?  
- **Overbudget penalty clause \= Some of his fixed payment gets taken back from him if the movie goes over budget**  
  * **Writer doesn’t get this overbudget provision because she does not control the costs – only producer does**

- **There are contingent amounts that depend on the person who is making the decision to influence the relevant factor** 

- **Net profits interest are rarely profitable, but there is one situation when they are more likely to pay: Cheap movie (controlled costs) that still generates a lot of revenue**  
  * **Producer controls costs so he decides whether they are going to choose a controlled costs movie or a blockbuster movie**  
    * **If he chooses the controlled costs model 🡪 His net profits interest is still in play, and he needs to be concerned about the budget (so that the budget penalty clause doesn’t come into play and his costs are limited to make money from the net profits interest)**  
    * **If he chooses the blockbuster model 🡪 His net profits interest is gone (because the movie is so expensive) and it is now the actor, receiving a gross profit interest, that is responsible for the movie’s success**  
    3. “This is my second movie. My first did well, so I’m getting $50,000 for this script, which is a lot more than the $10,000 that I got for my first script. Obviously, that’s good news,” she says. “They also are giving me a net participation, but my friends tell me that it’s unlikely to pay off in the end.” Is she right? What does Goldberg say about that?  
- **Net profits can pay her something in a low budget scenario, but it’s rare that it pays anything**  
  * **She is rewarded for success of movie through reputation and subsequent increases in future fixed fees**  
  * **For some people (writers) the incentive payment is in the form of making money in your fixed fee of your next movie**  
    * **Incentive still exists to do a good job but not on this movie anymore because there is nothing left to do**  
    4. “The net profits formula is really unfavorable to me,” Wilma says. “My friends say that this is just a sign that Peter drives a hard bargain. Studios will cheat us whenever they can, right?” Do you agree that bargaining power explains the net profits formula? (Hint: Goldberg is skeptical about that. Why?)  
- Not about Studios being abusive but rather   
- **Writer has the bargaining power when she negotiates the fixed fee so why are they using this net profits and not just giving her gross profits but paying her a much lower fixed fee. Not because she doesn’t have leverage but because she can’t do anything to maximize the movie’s revenue after she hands over the script**   
  * Therefore, incentivization process is through the change in fixed payment from movie to movie  
  * **Bargaining power can influence the total expected value of what you get but it does not impact the form of what you get necessarily**  
    5. In predicting whether Wilma’s net participation will yield a generous payment, you obviously need to make a judgment about whether the movie will be successful. Assume for the moment that it will be (a strong assumption, to be sure, but please make it anyway). For you to advise Wilma about her chances of getting paid, what question should you ask her? What else do you need to know? (Hint: This information is not about Wilma, but about other people.)  
- You need to know if there any major stars or directors who have joined the movie  
  * To evaluate a net profits interest value, you need to know if there are stars in the movie  
  * Once there is a star who takes a gross profits interest, your net profits interest is almost guaranteed to be nothing  
    * Two track aspect to this compensation:  
      * 1\) High budget route – net profit means nothing  
      * 2\) Low budget route – net profit could mean something

  2. Incentives: Interaction of Net and Gross Profit Participations  
     1. Three weeks later, Wilma calls you and says, “Peter has just signed a really big name–Alicia Actress–as the star of the movie, but I’m not sure whether to be happy or sad about this.” What is the downside for Wilma?  
- **Downside: Wilma is going to make nothing from the net profits interest**  
- **Upside: The movie might do better and in her next script she will get a bigger fixed fee**  
  2. “Keep in mind that Peter is in the same boat as you,” you respond. “In any event, I still think this is good news for you (and for Peter as well).” Please explain your statement. (Hint: Goldberg supplies the answer.)  
- **Downside: Peter makes nothing on the value of his net profits interest too**  
- **Upside: Compensated by higher fixed payment in his next movie**  
  * Like Wilma, producer will also be compensated in larger future fixed payment

- **Goldberg: Producer has two ways to make extra money so he will pick the way that will most likely make money for the movie**  
  * **Keep it low budget and we can still fill theaters (makes more on net profits interest)**  
  * **Make it big budget with a big star (get bigger fixed fee next time)**  
    * **Producer would not destroy his net profits interest unless he thinks that by giving a star a gross profits interest, he is significantly increasing the chance that the movie will be a big hit**  
    * Studio might even waive the overbudget penalty clause if the star is that big of a deal  
- **Because the producer makes the decision on getting a star, his compensation should be tailored to choosing the most profitable route for the movie**  
  3. Don’t Alicia’s gross profits interest reduce Peter’s incentive to control costs and do his best work? According to Goldberg, why is Studio willing to dilute Peter’s incentive in this way?  
- Yes actor reduces producer’s incentives to control costs  
  * **Once you go this route of getting the star, the revenue from the movie will be generated by the big star (not the producer). So move the incentive compensation to the big star and away from producer because the star is now the key decision maker**  
    * **Peter’s ability to shave a little costs here or there doesn’t matter**  
    4. After the production of the movie is complete, what additional steps can Alicia take to help it succeed? How, if at all, does a gross participation motivate her to take this step?  
- Only Alicia can do the talkshows, interviews, press tours  
  * She is busy on a new movie, but if you give her a cut of her the gross revenue in this movie she will do the advertising stunts  
    5. A film without a big star like Alicia can’t depend on the step in “i” to generate interest in the movie. According to Goldberg, when this is the case, whose efforts become more important in marketing it? Does the typical deal structure for a deal without a big star create the right incentives for others to step in and do more?  
- **Without a big star, the producer’s efforts are more valuable to tailor costs and the studio’s efforts in advertising are key (without the star)**  
  * **So the deal is structured so that:**  
    * **1\) Producer has a chance to make money from net profits interest**  
    * **2\) Studio recoups its costs first before sharing with anyone**  
    6. Wilma calls you up a year later. “My last movie was a big hit, but my net participation didn’t pay off. I’m pretty annoyed about that,” she says. “Peter (who produced that movie) just called me, asking me to do another script. He’s offering me $100,000 for it and another net participation.” After you congratulate her, she poses a question: “This time, should I insist that the studio can’t grant anyone a gross participation?” What is your advice for Wilma? Why might this strategy backfire? (Hint: Again, Goldberg supplies the answer.)  
- No. Wilma should not do this because this ensures that big stars will not participate in the movie because they can’t get gross profit interest. This can prevent her from getting a higher fixed fee in the future  
  * The studio might just cut her outright because gross profits interest is part of the business model  
    7. Studio makes Wilma and Peter “pay or play” on the movie. What does this mean? What kind of option does this give Studio? (Hint: we used this term in our discussions of venture capital.)  
- **Pay or Play \= Studio pays writer/producers even if the movie does not get made**  
  * **This is an option to abandon the movie**  
  * **This Staged financing \= In VC, you make a payment that gives you time to decide if you want to make another payment**

5. Monitoring and Incentives  
   1. Paula, a producer, is negotiating to sign Andrew, an up-and-coming actor, to work on a movie. The movie will be directed by Delia, a prominent and experienced director. Andrew receives a net participation. Does he need it to be properly motivated to do a good job? One potential rationale would be that his effort is not observable. If others can’t tell whether he is really trying, he needs to be self-motivated. But can’t Delia (the director) tell whether Andrew is making an effort and doing a good job? Also, doesn’t Andrew have other financial incentives to do his best work? What is Weinstein’s view on this issue?  
- Weinstein thinks that effort is very observable especially by directors who are highly skilled at identifying talent  
  * You don’t need the net profit participation because Hollywood is a small town and you get opportunities based off of reputation  
- **You do not need contingent compensation to motivate people when you can observe what they are doing**  
  * **Goldberg’s theory fails**  
  * You can ask the director, how is this actor? That will tell you if you are going to work with him again

  2. Ned, whose novel is being adapted for the screen to make this movie, is also receiving a net participation. Ned wrote the novel five years ago, and someone else is writing the screenplay. How important is it to motivate Ned to do good work? Is the rationale for his net participation an incentive-based rationale? What is Weinstein’s view?  
- **Rationale for net profits is better explained by budget constrained rationale**  
  * **For the actors you can observe them so they don’t need revenue sharing, and for the writers they are done so they don’t need revenue participation either (even through net)**  
- **Weinstein: This is about risk sharing**

  3. In the studio era, actors were permanent employees at studios. But since the studio era ended, they are hired only for a specific picture. According to Weinstein, what effect, if any, does this change have on an actor’s incentives to do her best work on a given movie?  
- **Frequent contracting:** This increases an actor’s incentives to do his or her best work on a given movie because they are constantly engaging in new contracts with new players. Frequent contracting increases incentives for actors to do well so that new producers/directors will want to hire them

6. Risk and Incentives  
   1. Do Goldberg and Weinstein have the same or different views about the function of net and gross participations?  
- Different

  2. Compared with Goldberg, is Weinstein more or less persuaded of the importance of motivating actors, directors, and others to do their best work? Does he have a different theory about how to motivate them?  
- Weinstein acknowledges the importance of incentives but does not think that the contracts are there to create incentives  
  * **Actors’ incentives are already dealt with by direct monitoring (directors monitor actors)**

- **Weinstein: Net/gross participation is because of Risk-based allocation**  
  * Studio could’ve paid the stars a fixed amount but instead they want to share the profit with them if the movie does well and cut their costs (allocating risk to the actor) if the movie does less well

  3. Hollywood studios generally are part of publicly traded companies. Their shareholders usually are diversified. So if studios are run to serve the interests of shareholders, shouldn’t they be risk neutral?  
- Diversification deals with the risk  
- **Goldberg critique of Weinstein:** Studio should not be run to allocate risk to talent because the studios are owned by diversified SH who do not care about risk

  4. According to Weinstein, why might studios behave as if they are risk averse? What kind of incentive problem (which we have encountered before) can cause this behavior?  
- **Weinstein Response:** Studio executives make the decisions, and they are not as diversified in the other companies  
  * Managers are much more sensitive to risk than the SH  
  * **Risk-spreading is for the benefit of the managers (not SH)**

- **Agency Cost: Managers want these profits interests to allocate risk to actors because they are making decisions based on their own risk tolerance without the risk sensitivity of SH in mind**

  5. What risk-related function does Weinstein attribute to net and gross participations?  
- Net and gross profit transfers risk from studio to the actors

  6. When Producer negotiates with Actors to hire them to work on the movie, what information might Producer have that they don’t have? Conversely, what information might they have that Paula doesn’t have? According to Weinstein, how (if at all) can net or gross profit participations help to bridge this information asymmetry?  
- Producer knows more about the other movie K’s and the movie’s market  
- Actors know more about their motivation and capabilities

- **Signaling Bridging Information Asymmetry: The willingness of talent to take this risk is a signal that they are confident they will do a good job**

  7. If the success of movies is hard to predict, one possible response is that producers and talent will invest time and effort in making better predictions. Alternatively, another response is to use profit-sharing contracts. According to Weinstein, how can net and gross participations help the parties respond to uncertainty?  
- It is not as important to predict the success because you are not as invested in each movie  
- If you don’t really know what is going to happen, **the uncertainty encourages sharing the risk because it’s not worth trying to draft a K to reflect accurate predictions of the movie – just share the risk**  
  * Uncertainty in the industry is so hard to unpack that you are better off not trying to unpack it and just dividing it

- **3 Reasons for Profits Interests:**  
  * **1\) Risk sharing because of agency cost**  
  * **2\) Risk sharing to deal with uncertainty**  
  * **3\) Risk sharing as signal to bridge information asymmetry**

- Interprets the same K provisions differently than Goldberg (not incentive based)

7. Dan is a director, and he is negotiating with Paula, a producer who is the head of Studio, about whether he will direct *Hit Movie*.   
   1. A key question is how important Dan’s effort is in making the movie a success. If Dan just goes through the motions–not motivating the actors, not keeping the filming on schedule, and not trying to be creative in the way the movie is filmed–will his lack of effort impede the movie’s success?  
- Shirking will impede the success of the movie

  2. Assume that Dan is extremely motivated, tirelessly and energetically doing everything he can to improve the movie’s quality and to get it done on time and under budget. According to Arthur De Vany, do his efforts guarantee that the movie will be successful?  
- **A lack of effort can hurt the movie, but complete dedication won’t guarantee success because of uncertainty**

  3. Alan and Ann are actors who are the stars of *Hit Movie*. Let’s consider the same question. How important is their effort? If they don’t try, will their lack of effort scuttle the movie? According to De Vany, if they do try, will their efforts guarantee success?  
- Lack of effort will harm the movie, but extra effort won’t guarantee success because of uncertainty

  4. Paula is considering whether to pay Dan, Alan, and Ann with a fixed salary only, or to supplement their salary with pay based on the movie’s performance.   
     1. If Paula believes that Dan, Alan, and Ann’s efforts are important to the success of the movie, is that an argument to use incentive compensation?  
- Yes, incentive compensation is motivating (Goldberg)  
  2. True or false: **If the goal of contingent compensation is to motivate the talent to do better work, the condition that triggers the compensation need to be chosen carefully: the talent should be rewarded for effort and for adding value, and the reward should be withheld when they don’t do a good job**.  
- True.  
  3. Do “net profits” interests seem like they are set in the right way to reward the talent’s effort? Why or why not?  
- Net profits are not set properly to reward the talent’s efforts because even if the actors do a good job, net profits interest often doesn’t pay anything  
  * The only time net profits might pay is to producer (in a low budget movie with no gross profits interest hit)  
    4. What about “gross participations”? Compared with net participations, do they seem better calibrated–or not as well calibrated–to reward Dan, Alan, and Ann’s efforts?  
- Gross participations are better calibrated to pay out for actor’s efforts

- **Gross profits interest is the real incentive compensation (only given to the people who need the incentive and whose efforts can impact the movie’s success)**  
  * Net profits interest only incentives in that low budget movie decision

8. Before Paula negotiates contracts with Dan, Alan, and Ann, and the rest of the team, she meets with Arthur De Vany.  
   1. In the course of the meeting, De Vany describes his thought experiment involving the weight of students in his class. What is the thought experiment? What is his point?  
- **Hollywood works on outliers:** Few outlier blockbusters dominate film industry success  
  * The difference between bad and average movies is small  
  * But the thing that drives revenue for the studio is the blockbuster movie. They are rare but important

  2. De Vany also repeats a line from today’s reading: “About 5 percent of movies earn close to 80 percent of motion picture profit.” Should this fact influence how Paula thinks about incentive compensation? To what extent does effort determine whether a movie ends up being in the top five percent of earners?  
- **In theory, the fact that the outlier blockbusters have so much influence could be an argument for incentive compensation being important because it will encourage hard work which will make it more likely for your film to be in that top 5 percent**

  3. Recognizing the extremely broad range of potential box office results, Paula says to De Vany, “That’s why it’s so important to motivate the talent.” How do you think De Vany would respond?  
- **De Vany would be skeptical of the motivation theory because existence of motivation is not an indicator of success due to uncertainty**

  4. De Vany argues that it’s very hard to predict which movies will be the top 5% grossing movies. Part of the reason, he says, has to do with the demand for a specific movie. What shapes it? How predictable are these “nonlinear” factors?  
- A lot has to do with the way the movie starts and the transmission of opinion from early audiences to later audiences

- **De Vany would critique Goldberg: It is random. Incentives are not important because of the uncertainty**

  5. According to De Vany, part of the reason why movie revenue is unpredictable has to do with supply. Once a movie has been made, how costly is it to show it to more people?  
- 

  6. During his meeting with Paula, De Vany repeats another line from the reading today: “If you don’t know anything, then how do you pay a director or an actor?” What is De Vany’s answer?  
- 

  7. In light of your answer to “f,” is De Vany recommending contingent compensation–such as net and gross participations–as a way to motivate talent?  
- 

  8. Is De Vany’s analysis more like Goldberg’s or Weinstein’s view?  
- **Weinstein’s explanation is better suited to De Vany’s analysis because De Vany thinks more about the uncertainty and risks uncertainty creates so dividing up these risks makes sense through the net/gross profits – not guaranteeing the success of these movies through incentives**

- **Incentive compensation K’s:**  
  * **Why are they structured like this?**  
    * **Weinstein: There are other mechanisms that guarantee incentives (they will make more next time, they are monitored by others). These contingent K’s are about risk-spreading (because executives are not diversified)**  
    * **Goldberg: Incentives matter. You need to see how the incentives align with the behavior you want**

- Parallel to VC:  
  * Uncertainty as to what the successes will be, but a few success stories drive the entire industry  
  * **Incentives are critical to situations even when they do not guarantee you an outcome so act as if they do**  
    * **In the situations where you are right you will be glad you had the incentives (even if it is uncertain they will work in most situations)**

**Studio ROFR to Produce Sequel:**

- Did all the work to market the first one  
- Protects its investment in the franchise  
  * A studio invests significant resources in making a film, including development, production, marketing, and distribution. A right of first refusal ensures the studio can continue the franchise and potentially recoup its investment and generate further profits.  
  * A studio wants to maintain control over its IP and brand. A right of first refusal prevents another studio from potentially taking over the franchise, changing the creative direction, or affecting the franchise's overall success.  
  * A right of first refusal helps prevent potential disruptions and conflicts that might arise if a different studio were to suddenly take over a franchise.  
- Repeat Players: A right of first refusal allows the studio to make strategic decisions about the franchise, including casting, writing, and production.  
- Distributor has theater connections that worked  
- More certainty this time around that the sequel movie will be successful if the first one was so they want to lock it up

# 21: Earnouts (Solution and Source of Information/Incentive Problems)

- Earnouts: Another form of contingent payment

- 2 Components:  
  * 1\) Bridge Differences in Parties’ Valuation of a Deal  
    * Without earnout parties might not have a ZOPA  
    * But the earnout can carve out the relevant contingency to reconstruct the ZOPA for the rest of the deal

  * 2\) Limited/hard to use because by solving the information problem, you create other information and incentive problems  
    * Need to define carefully what you are measuring in order to determine what the contingent purchase price will be  
    * What games can parties play to manipulate the number  
      * Buyer has ability to control/manipulate as the new owner of subsidiary  
        * Profit based number  
          * Costs are relevant but which costs (buyer has incentive to include additional costs)  
      * Buyer has ability to market/push relevant part of the earnout  
        * But seller’s ability to determine what the effort is undercuts the appeal of the earnout. They can do this for 2 reasons:  
          * 1\) Valid – The other companies’ products buyer bought were better. Can’t surrender this ability to make the judgments to seller management even if they stay on  
            * Either way valid or not, this is what buyer will say  
          * 2\) Self-interested – Reduce the amount of the earnout by waiting to give it attention and when the earnout period is up, then engaging with seller’s company  
    * Therefore, earnouts are used less than you might expect

1. Seller has an established business selling software. The existing products generate a robust revenue stream, which the seller values at between $200 M & $250 M. Buyer is considering making a bid, valuing the business as between $175 M and $225 M.  
     
   Seller has a new version of its software coming out in six months. A key question is how well received it will be in the market. Skeptics think it is not as good as the new software soon to be released by a competitor, but Seller loyalists expect it is just what Seller needs to rejuvenate the brand. The key question is how well the new software will sell. Skeptics (including Buyer management) think there is a 20% chance that 300 million copies will sell in the first year, adding $100 M of value to the company, while loyalists (including Seller management) think there is an 80% chance that 300 million copies will sell and the new software will add $100 M of value.

     
   1. Without the new software, is there a ZOPA in this transaction?  
- Yes. ZOPA is $25M from $200M to $225M without the new software

  2. With the new software, does it seem (at least at first glance) that there is a ZOPA for this transaction?  
- No. ZOPA with new software is:  
  * Seller: 80%($100M) from new software \+ $200M reservation price of initial business \= $280M (least seller would accept)  
  * Buyer: 20%($100M) from new software \+ $225M reservation price of initial business \= $245M (most buyer would pay)  
- Contingency killed the deal/ZOPA

  3. Do you think predictions about the success of the new software pose issues of asymmetric information? Or uncertainty? Or both?  
- **New software poses uncertainty issues** because neither party is completely sure how it will play out especially in comparison to the competing product  
- **New software poses asymmetric information problem** because seller has more understanding than buyer of how the software was developed and if it will work well, but **seller also has incentive to misrepresent their information** to buyer to drive up the bidding price

  4. What contractual mechanism can potentially help to enable Buyer and Seller to find a mutually agreeable price?  
- **Earnout or contingent value right** depending on if the software company is public or private  
  * **This allows parties to go back to old ZOPA to figure out what the pricing would be without the new variable at a fixed price and then add in the varying/contingent price later**  
    * Let things play out and amount will depend on whose prediction was right  
      * Portion of the purchase price is resolved later instead

  5. What is the difference between an earnout and a contingent value right?  
- Earnout \= Contractual agreement where buyer makes a supplemental payment to seller’s shareholders if the post-acquisition company’s performance meets specific goals over a specified period of time  
  * Only works for privately held companies or subsidiaries of public companies because buyer must be able to locate the shareholders to pay them  
- Contingent Value Right \= Buyer issues a security to seller’s shareholders to compensate them if the post-acquisition company’s performance meets specific goals over a specified period of time  
  * Same as earnout but in a public company

- **Same thing economically but earnout is in a private deal and CVR is public (can be traded to someone else)**

  6. Do you think the relevant instrument here should be based on appraised value of the company in six months? Or on something else? Why?  
- The earnout should be based on the revenue generated (sales) from the copies of the software sold in the six months to a year after the closing  
  * It should not be based on the appraised value of the company because buyer might do other things to improve the company and its value other than have the software release (replace management)  
  * **Needs to be based on something objective, specific performance metrics (sales or approval of a drug) because valuations can shift over the time and parties may still not agree in six months on what the new value of the seller’s product was**


2. Ann is an up-and-coming tennis player. Nickel, a popular sports apparel company, is discussing an endorsement deal with her. Ann has charisma and an exciting playing style, as well as the potential to be a top 10 player or perhaps even a top 3 player. But she has a tendence to choke in big matches, and she also injured her knee last year. She is likely to recover fully, but there’s uncertainty about this. Bob, who is negotiating for Nickel, is trying to figure out what to offer Ann. A $100X annual payment is appropriate for a top-20 player (which is what she is now), but a $300X annual payment is appropriate for a top-10 player (which is what she could be). Nickel is also considering creating a special line of tennis sneakers named for Ann, which she would wear.  
     
   Obviously, Nickel is not the only game in town. Adonis is also speaking with Ann, Obviously, Nickel has many other prospects as well.   
   1. Why is the fixed payment hard to determine?  
- How good Ann is at tennis corresponds to how much Nickel will make from sponsoring her. Since there is uncertainty about how she will perform due to her game, characteristics, and injury, there is also uncertainty about how much Nickel should pay her

- 3 Variables make the player’s valuation difficult: Performance uncertainty (tendency to choke), injury risk, and comparison to other players are all uncertain  
  * Fixed payment is limiting because there is too much uncertainty in the expected valuation (how much she can help Nikel earn)

  2. What alternatives can Bob consider in structuring a package for Ann? Please offer some detail about the contract you have in mind.  
- Incentive based compensation will help Bob here:  
  * $100X annual fixed payment (lowest range of where she might be, the minimum)  
  * $300X if she is top 10 for a certain period of time  
  * More money if she becomes top 3 (highest range of where she thinks she can get)  
  * **Product line revenue sharing**  
  * Time limit on the deal subject to re-negotiation: 3-5 year deal  
  * Termination right if injury sidelines her for a long time


3. Christine, a scientist, is the CEO of a pharmaceutical startup called C-Pharma. She is hard at work on a new pain killer, Nopain, which would be effective and not addictive. She intends for this drug to be for patients who have had surgery or sustained serious injuries, and thus need pain relief for between 2 and 6 weeks. C-Pharma has no other drugs in development.  
     
   Dalia, who is the head of acquisitions for  Big-Pharma, is considering making a bid for C-Pharma. She recognizes that if Nopain actually works, it will be extremely marketable. Dalia predicts that the revenue stream’s discounted value will be worth $300 M or more.   
     
   But Dalia is struggling to figure out the likelihood that Nopain actually will succeed. There are several steps in the process. Will it actually be effective in treating pain? Will there be harmful or unpleasant side effects? Will it be finished before competitor drugs come to market? Will it get the necessary regulatory approvals?   
     
   1. Why might Christine and Dalia make different predictions about these questions? If they do, what effect do their differences have on the ability to price the deal?  
- Christine and Daila may make different predictions about these questions because of information and incentive imbalances  
  * Christine, drug owner, knows more about the drug and has more reason to believe in it because she is a founder. She also has incentive to misrepresent her confidence to Daila  
  * Daila can’t tell if Christine’s belief in the drug is really her confidence based on true information she knows or based on her incentive to make it up. Even if she has some expertise in evaluating companies in this field

  * **3 Rationales for Founder/Investor or Buyer/Seller Information Asymmetry:**  
    * **Founder knows more**  
    * **Founder is optimistic (has more reason to believe in it)**  
    * **Founder has incentive to misrepresent information (her confidence)**

  2. What alternative can you suggest for Dalia to propose? Why does it help bridge the differences between Christine and Dalia?  
- **Fixed price at the low end plus an earnout which is at the high end** helps to bridge the differences because it enables Christine to benefit from the drug regardless of if she owns the business when the drug’s successes are known  
  * This will bring her reserve price as to what the business is worth closer to Daila’s, creating a ZOPA, because the most uncertain factor of the drug’s effectiveness is out of the way

  3. Should your proposal in part “b” be based on several milestones or just one or two? Which ones would you pick and why?  
- Several milestones will provide more accurate payment to Daila  
  * **Regulatory approval**  
    * Without this approval, the earnout price should be near zero. So fixed payment should be very low but provide a good bump if there is regulatory approval  
  * **Sales revenue in six months from drug**  
  * **Sales revenue in 12 months from drug**  
    * Need to prove that the drug is profitable (comparison to other competing drugs)  
  * Each milestone deducts lawsuit damages from patients with poor side effects

  4. What signal do Christine and Dalia send in crafting a term like the one in “b”? Why might that be helpful?  
- **Earnout for Asymmetric Information: Seller knows more so buyer cannot commit to a high fixed price, and the earnout acts to bridge the information**

- Daila signals her confidence in the company outside of the drug because she is almost removing the drug from the company and treating as a separate revenue stream, making Christine a more willing seller  
- **Christine also signals her confidence** in the drug because she is willing to take a potentially lower purchase price in exchange for this after-closing payment. Therefore, she is signaling that it is going to work

  5. Is the term in “b” more or less helpful if Christine would stay on to run C-Pharma as a subsidiary of Big-Pharma?  
- **Earnout for Incentive Problem: Helps incentive problem if seller is going to stay on to help launch the product because she is incentivized to make the product better to get the higher earnout price**  
  * Usually, seller would stay on to run this through regulatory approval, start the marketing campaign  
      
4. Whale-co, which makes widgets, is considering an acquisition of Minnow-co, which makes a specialized type of widget, which Whale-co management thinks could become a new source of revenue for Whale-co. Yet Whale-co is thinking of Minnow-co as just one possible new direction. It is acquiring 7 other companies that have similar prospects. There is significant uncertainty about which, if any, of these 8 companies will succeed. Meanwhile, Whale-co earns $1 billion per year, while Minnow-co earns $30 million per year.   
   1. If Whale-co wants to incorporate an earnout in the offer, would a revenue based earnout make sense? Or a profit-based earnout? What are the advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches?  
- **Profit-based earnout** \= Payment based on percentage of the revenue minus expenses  
  * Preferred by buyers  
  * Harder to measure/monitor  
  * Better aligned with actual value creation of the seller’s company  
- **Revenue-based earnou**t \= Payment based on percentage of the revenue  
  * Preferred by sellers  
  * Easier to measure/monitor  
  * Can incentivize overselling in the short-term

- **Profit-based earnouts are better because they are more accurate depictions of the value of the product. However, profit-based earnouts are harder because it is easier to manipulate profit numbers rather than revenue**  
  * **When Minnow becomes part of Whale, the revenue it generates is measured in sales, but its costs can include senior management time allocation, marketing campaign – all of which Whale controls**  
    * **Whale has incentive to inflate the Minnow acquisition up with costs so that they pay less in the earnout**  
  * **So revenue-based earnout might be used even if it less accurate**

  2. Why might the Minnow-co management worry about depending too heavily on an earnout in this situation? How might Whale-co have a conflict of interest?  
- **The earnout might not benefit Minnow because Whale is acquiring other competitors who are in a similar line of business so they may find that another company’s product is better and focus on selling that one which de-values Minnow’s earnout or they may purposely favor the acquisition that they have to pay the least in earnout price to**  
  * **All 8 sellers compete for attention/resources from the buyer**

- **2 Incentive Issues with earnouts:**  
  * **1\)** **Cost Allocation** – Buyer is inflating acquired company with costs  
    * Can be fixed with revenue based earnout  
  * **2\) Buyer Discretion** – Buyer gets to decide how they want to market, advance, produce the product  
    * If buyer acquired multiple companies, they may choose to favor the company that has the most buyer-friendly earnout, lowering the purchase price

  3. Why is it challenging to pick a length of time for the earnout period? What are the risks if it is short? If it is long?  
- Because of the product or seller’s asset they want a piece of is uncertain, time for its success is also uncertain  
  * Too short and seller is robbed of revenue that they might be entitled to  
  * Too long and seller is taking additional revenue from buyer they are not entitled to

- **Uncertainty Issue:** On the merits, there is still a challenge of knowing what the right timing is  
  * Too short and buyer didn’t give the new subsidiary enough time to be successful  
  * Too long and earnout is starting to measure buyer’s contributions to the subsidiary more than the seller’s

- **Incentive Issue:** In addition, buyer is incentivized to manipulate the earnout by setting the period short and having no one works on the product for the earnout period and when it expires profits come in

- **Earnout: Information Problem 🡪 Earnout Solution 🡪 Information and Incentive Problems**

  4. Whale-co is buying a number of different companies. Why might this be a red flag to Minnow-co, as its management considers whether to agree to an earnout?  
- Buyer’s management has more control over the revenue that the product will earn than seller’s. They may make a strategic choice in good faith to focus on another product or they might intentionally divert revenue away from seller’s product to another product so they don’t have to pay so much in the earnout

  5. To what extent can the problems in “d” be addressed by a reasonableness term in the contract? Or by specifying who makes management decisions?  
- Reasonableness can try to address the problem by demanding more from buyer management, but this can only go so far because reasonable efforts are hard to measure  
  * Can’t be specific about what choices will be made

- **Specifying who makes management decisions can help** because if it someone seller trusts or has influence over they will work to help seller’s product. Sometimes, it will even be the seller themselves staying on at the company  
- **But if you give full decision making authority to seller’s management, seller is reassured but buyer’s management will not be reassured because maybe buyer will make a good faith decision to not prioritize seller, but they are stuck with seller management making the decisions**

  6. What other ideas do K & S mention and what problems do they identify with them?  
- Agency costs of buyer management managing seller’s product


5. Did K & S recommend the use of earnouts or not? What position do you think they were taking? Did you agree with it?  
- K\&S recommend earnouts are used pretty rarely because they are difficult to design without creating new incentive and information problems

- Earnouts in the context of an identifiable event to which value can be tied to (product release, drug approval) is better

6. In what situations will earnouts be most effective? When will they be least effective? Why?  
- **Earnouts will be most effective where there is clear performance metrics of a freestanding event (regulatory approval)**  
  * **Both the acquirer and seller want approval (incentives aligned) and neither has complete control over whether it is granted because they are not making that decision**  
- **Earnouts will be least effective where there is high integration is necessary**. If the acquirer deeply integrates the seller’s company into their business, it will be hard to measure if it is buyer or seller generating the revenue and the buyer maintains more control over deciding whether or not to prioritize it

- Earnouts will be most effective when there is an identifiable event (freestanding thing) to which value will be linked like a regulatory approval of a drug  
  * Outside the control of both parties – regulatory approval (both parties have incentive to get the approval even if there are further questions that come up while under buyer’s control like marketing)  
- Earnouts will be least effective when they are based on high integration is needed because it will be hard to determine how much the seller’s company actually contributed to buyer  
- financial metrics because they are harder to design and implement  
  * It is hard for the parties to agree on a set of financial data that expect will reflect the increase in value to the buyer after the acquisition  
  * It is also hard for the buyer and seller to agree on what value should be measured

# 22: Incentive Designs

1. Parties enter in transactions seeking value from each other. An important challenge arises when the parties have trouble determining whether their counterparty actually is doing what it promised to do.  
   1. What term do economists use to describe performance that is hard to observe?  
- **Moral Hazard \= When parties act in a self-interested way but their actions are not observable/verifiable**

  2. Even when performance is hard to observe, why might parties perform anyway? (Hint: the answer is not rooted in contract.)  
- Personal integrity, reputational reasons (repeat relationships)

  3. How is moral hazard different from adverse selection?  
- Moral Hazard \= When parties act in a self-interested way but their actions are not observable/verifiable  
  * **After Transaction:** Now that I have insurance, behave like go skydiving/riskier actions, undermining the deal

- **Adverse Selection \= Insurance or another industry attracts the types of people that are tempted to incur losses that insurance will pay**  
  * **Before Transaction:** People who are less healthy want health insurance more than those who do not  
  * The mere fact that insurance is offered will attract a group of people that will be more expensive to insure

- Timing difference: Moral hazard is happening after the transaction and adverse selection is happening before

  4. Adam is CEO of XYZ, a public company. CEO comp tends to rise with the size of the company. Adam has the opportunity for XYZ to acquire ABC. What is the potential for moral hazard here?  
- CEO may push for acquisition even if it is not in the company’s best interest to increase his compensation  
  * Agency cost  
  * Moral Hazard \= Hard to observe whether this is a good deal for company or more just a good deal for him

2. Betty is founder and CEO of a biotech startup, which is seeking to cure Disease. She approaches Big Pharma for financing. Big Pharma (“BP”) provides $50 million. In return, if Betty develops a cure, Big Pharma will get a mandatory licence to commercialize the drug and will receive 15% the revenue from selling the cure.  
   1. Why didn’t BP simply buy the idea from Betty? What problems make this structure more appealing?  
- **2 Hurdles to Purchasing the Drug from Founder:**  
  * **1\) Asymmetric Information problem:** Team working on the drug knows more about how successful the drug will be than the buyer (and buyer will be skeptical)  
  * **2\) Incentive problem:** Structuring the deal this way instead of a fixed payment, encourages the Founder working on the drug to keep to working for regulatory approval (rather than in a fixed payment where she wouldn’t care if the drug was approved)

  2. Why didn’t BP offer a fixed price to Betty’s startup, instead of sharing royalties?  
- Information and incentive problems can be solved with contingent compensation

  3. Assume the annual revenue is $10 million. Assume also that BP has limited cash. Instead of investing in the development of Betty’s cure, BP could put money into a different drug, DD, which treats a different disease. BP developed DD itself, and expects it to generate $9.5 million of annual revenue. Which is BP likely to favor?  
- BP is likely to favor their own drug because they do not have to pay a royalty (acts as a tax). In the royalty, they only keep $8.5M

  4. To address this issue, is it better to have a larger up-front payment or a larger royalty?  
- Larger up front payment with small royalty is better to address the taxing issue of the royalty. So, making the contingent payment smaller is better because it distorts the buyer’s decision making less if the payment is smaller  
  * But the contingent payment is still necessary for solving the information/incentive problems that the buyer has when buying from Founder  
    * **Without asymmetric information and incentive issues, you would not need contingent payments**

- Solution in a deal creates new problems

  5. Are there other potential responses? (Hint: how can the visibility of BP’s actions be increased?)  
- Not enough visibility/observability here so maybe if you could monitor her behavior by getting audit rights, oversight committee that Founder is on, or paying out at certain milestones more money but less royalty

3. Christine is CEO of Debtor Co, and she owns all of its equity, which is worth $25 million. Emma has lent Debtor Co $50 million. Christine is considering a deal with a 40% chance of doubling Debtor Co’s total capitalized value (including debt and equity \= $75M so total assets are worth $75M) to $150, and a 60% chance of reducing its value to $0.  
   1. Is the expected value of this deal positive or negative overall?  
- Negative expected value  
  * $150M(40%) \= $60M  
  * $0(60%) \= $0  
  * Value of the business is $60M which is less than the current value

  2. For Christine in particular, is the expected value positive or negative?  
- Positive expected value for CEO  
  * $150M  
    * Debt gets $50M and equity gets $100M. **All of the increase goes to the equity holders**  
      * For equity:  
        * $100M(40%) \= $40M  
        * $0(60%) \= $0  
        * Expected Value for Equity \= $40M which is more than the $25M the equity holders have currently  
    * **Equity has incentive to take risks (even with risks with negative expected value) because the negative value will be passed to debt holders**  
      * **Another form of Moral Hazard/Agency Problem: Equity makes the business decisions but is incentivized to act in their self-interest over those of the entire company**  
  * $0  
    * Debt gets $0 and equity gets $0

  3. Generalizing from this example, how can leverage produce moral hazard for equity holders?  
- Equity holders have more incentive to take risks (even when risks have negative expected value) because they get the upside but debt holders are not able to share in the upside  
  * This is also moral hazard \= Keep gains for yourself and pass risks to debtors

- Why lend money at all then?  
  * There is a K. Debt covenants impose discipline/limits on the management, protecting debt holders from this incentive misalignment

4. In insurance contracts, how do insurance companies address moral hazard?  
- Insurance companies use:  
  * Exclusion/premium  
  * **Deductible/co-pays** – making sure that the policy holder is responsible for some payment  
    * Undercuts misalignment that moral hazard creates  
    * **If policy holder bears some of the risk, this limits their interest in being completely indifferent to risk when being insured**

5. In principle, parties should try to introduce financial incentives to head off moral hazard. K\&S say this is challenging. Why?  
- You would create the perfect K if you could but imbalances in information//incentive problems make it hard to do. So instead, do something else. But these new tools create information and incentive problems

6. Frank is a salesman. He would rather earn a fixed salary, but his employer wants to pay him on commission.   
   1. What is the advantage of the commission structure?  
- Commission structure ties his compensation to making sales, motivating him. The salesman may not be monitored/observed like the talent in movies  
  * **Incentive/performance-based pay is a self-monitoring device**

  2. Why is Frank potentially unhappy with it? What might he demand in return?  
- Having pay conditioned on effort makes sense for monitoring but it is hard to measure effort precisely (doesn’t automatically translate to higher sales figures). So salesman will want higher commission pay or higher fixed pay if he can get it to offer some stability (in case external factors (tariffs) can harm him)

- If salesman wants fixed pay 2 Reasons why:  
  * 1\) Signals laziness  
  * 2\) Needs steady paycheck  
    * In order to take on this risk, he might ask for more commission payment. If I take this risk on, I want to be compensated more

  3. In principle, might it be worth it for Frank’s employer to pay him extra as a way to induce him to take more risk?  
- When you start introducing contingencies, expected value should go up because they are taking more risk

7. Georgia is managing partner of a law firm, which traditionally has lock-step compensation. She is considering switching to an “eat what you kill” system.  
   1. What advantages do you see in this change?  
- **Eat What You Kill Advantages:**  
  * **1\) Motivates partners to bring in more business, increasing revenue**  
  * **2\) Firms will keep people who bring in the most business by paying them based on the amount of business they bring in** 

  2. What advantages do you see in the lock-step system?  
- **Lock-Step Advantages:**  
  * **1\) Teamwork/collaboration, less cut-throat culture by limiting internal competition**  
  * **2\) Not always clear on how to measure who brings in the business (constantly adjudicating disputes)**  
  * **3\) Eat What You Kill Shifts focus to bringing in new business from working for existing clients**  
    * **If the system is well-calibrated firm will cut your pay if you lose a client, but this suffers from the same fingerprint issues**

- When the issues are not fully observable, the issues become difficult

8. Incentivizing multiple tasks  
   1. Why is it so hard to design an incentive system when the goal is to motivate people to succeed at multiple tasks on multiple dimensions?  
- **You want people to make judgments about what is needed in each moment, but if the incentives skew in favor of one task rather than another, this will not be effective**

  2. Why is this a problem at a law firm?  
- Incentive system at a law firm encourages focus on getting new clients and could neglect the existing ones

  3. Why was it a problem to give a bonus for home runs? And a penalty for interceptions? And a bonus for completed passes?  
- Bonus for homeruns is problematic because players will try to get to this extreme result and not perform better on average which can be most helpful for the team

- **What you reward is not necessarily what needs to happen in a given moment. So if the contracts are not structured in the right way, you can end up with something that skews behavior instead of what is needed in that moment**

9. Elaine Entrepreneur launches a high tech startup. Six months later, she persuades Veronica, a venture capitalist, to invest $20 million for 40% of the company, which implies a valuation for the whole company of $50 million. Veronica received convertible preferred shares, which give her voting control unless and until there is an IPO, in which case Veronica’s shares mandatorily convert into common.  
1. Review: there is a potential tax reason why Veronica’s shares are convertible preferred. What is it?  
- People who get common stock want to be able to value this stock very low so that they pay ordinary rates when they make the 83(b) election at a low valuation. Then, when the stock appreciates they pay capital gain on the appreciation. They can only do this if they give investors a different kind of stock that is valued differently. So, they give them convertible preferred 

2. Assume that Veronica’s shares have a “1X” liquidation preference. Veronica needs cash for another startup that she thinks is more interesting. Acquiror offers $21 million for the company, which obviously is $29M less than the implied valuation when Veronica invested. Does Veronica have an incentive to take this deal? Will Elaine think this is a good deal?  
- VC may take the deal because they can recoup their investmentq  
  * **Liquidation preference holder/common stock holder is similar to the debt/equity tension**  
    * **The preferred stock holder with the liquidation preference, is going to be okay with a deal where they recoup their investment, but the common stock holder will not**

- **But there is a reputational constraint on this: VC will not sell too cheaply because she will not get another deal next time**

3. In this situation, how much must Acquiror offer in order for Veronica to convert to common as part of the deal?  
- Offer must be above $50M

4. Assume that Veronica’s shares have a 2X liquidation preference, and Acquiror offers $41 million. How much does Veronica get? How much do Elaine and the other shareholders get?  
- Veronica gets $40M, leaving just $1M

5. Even though Veronica has voting control, how might Elaine and her team still try to block a sale?  
- When acquirer is buying the company, part of the reason that they are buying it is because the current management team is doing a good job. **If the Founder’s team threatens to leave, Founder can try to block the sale**  
  * There is leverage even outside of the K

10. SPAC  
    1. What is a SPAC?  
- **SPAC \= Special Purpose Acquisition Company**  
  * It exists to take another company public  
  * **SPAC Is public from the beginning, allowing public shareholders to buy into the company, but it is an empty shell. The public is buying stock in the leader that will find a deal/company to take public**

- **This exists to allow a company to circumvent securities laws (making them cheaper to comply with)** like the underwriting, disclosure forms, etc.  
  * **The SPAC is not a hard thing to take public by itself because you are disclosing an empty shell. Investors pay money which is spent on target. Once target is bought, there is not as much securities law disclosure necessary**  
    * This is a regulatory end-around

  2. SPACs have a “sponsor.” What is their role? What expenses do they bear? What benefits do they get?  
- **SPAC sponsors have to put in money to IPO** (even though it’s an easier IPO, it is still expensive). **In return, the sponsor gets equity which matches the money they put in \+ equity beyond the % money they put in**  
  * Sponsor gets a disproportionately large amount of equity for taking the risk of IPO’ing without a target  
    * This is how they are compensated before taking the risk  
      * If no deal 🡪 Sponsor loses its capital contribution for IPO  
      * If deal 🡪 Sponsor gets 10% cost for 30% ownership (extra equity)

- Example:  
  * $100M raised in SPAC  
  * Sponsor put in $10M, public financed $90M  
  * Sponsor gets 30% equity (beyond their 10% investment)  
  * Public gets 70% equity for 90% price

  3. What is “dilution”? Who gets diluted in a SPAC?  
- **Dilution happens to the public investors in the SPAC (not the sponsor) because the sponsor gets a disproportionate amount of equity if a deal happens**. The extra shares that go to the sponsor come at the expense of the public shareholders

  4. Who has a strong incentive to do an acquisition within the prescribed time period? Why?  
- The sponsor has the incentive because they have a lot to gain from the deal and a lot to lose from the deal not happening  
  * If you don’t do a deal, sponsor loses 10% initial investment  
  * If you do a deal, sponsor gets 30% for 10% payment

- **Moral Hazard: Sponsor should be motivated to do a deal that is worth $100M or more, but instead they are overincentivized by diluted structure to do a deal so they will do one for less than the total investment (because their ownership percentage increases)**  
  * Over incentivizes a deal  
  * Example:  
    * Total investment \= $100M  
    * Deal \= $50M  
    * Sponsor keeps \= $15M (more than the $10M they put in)

- Defending SPACs: Shareholders always had the option to decline the deal by pulling their money out and selling  
  * Counter: SH didn’t know to ask for their money back because they didn’t know they were getting a bad deal

  5. Are the incentives of managers and shareholders aligned in a SPAC?  
- No. Incentives of managers and shareholders are not aligned – management has more incentive to seek a deal
