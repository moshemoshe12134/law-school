## THE CORE PREMISE

Nonprofits face **two fundamental challenges**:

1. **Strategy** - Figuring out the best way to advance their mission
2. **Buy-in** - Getting enough people on board to implement it

The solution: **THE SIX Ps**

1. **PLAN** → Run a rigorous planning process
2. **PERSEVERE** → Line up internal support
3. **PRIORITIZE** → Set priorities with "the three questions"
4. **PIVOT** → Experiment and innovate
5. **PUBLICIZE** → Share ideas and hold yourself accountable
6. **PARTNER** → Raise more money by involving donors in the work

## CHAPTER BY CHAPTER SUMMARY

### Chapter 1: Introduction - Inspiration and Frustration

Opens with **Olga's story**—an elderly woman in Belarus surviving on $4/day, helped by JDC (the humanitarian organization Schizer led). This illustrates both the inspiring work nonprofits do and the agonizing resource allocation choices they face.

**Key Context**:
- The US has 1.5 million nonprofits spending $2.5 trillion annually (more than Canada's GDP)
- 70% of Americans donate to nonprofits, 25% volunteer
- **Core problem**: Nonprofit performance is hard to measure (no profit/stock price), so bad choices are harder to expose and there's less pressure to change

**Author's Experience**:
- Dean of Columbia Law School during the 2008 financial crisis (endowment contracted, jobs dried out, had to do more with less)
- CEO of JDC (2017-2019) - spent over 1/3 of budget on elderly clients in former Soviet Union

Both roles faced difficult trade-offs: which programs to fund, which to cut. Some nonprofits handle this well; others become dysfunctional.

### Chapter 2: The Best of Times - Strengths of Nonprofits

Explores five "mixed blessings" of nonprofits—this chapter covers the **positive side**:

#### 1. Mission and Goals
- Nonprofits exist to pursue causes, not make money
- "If you can't find it, found it" - people can create nonprofits for any cause
- **Example**: Charles Best created DonorsChoose from a Bronx teacher's lounge; it now raises $150M/year and has funded nearly 2 million classroom projects

#### 2. Motivation
- Employees and volunteers driven by idealism, not money
- People accept lower pay to work for causes they believe in
- **Example**: Ruth Bader Ginsburg founded ACLU Women's Rights Project after facing discrimination (asked why she was "occupying a seat that could be held by a man")

#### 3. Diversity
- Nonprofits can serve specific communities that for-profits ignore
- Different communities can form their own nonprofits
- **Example**: Father Richard Gabuzda cofounded Institute for Priestly Formation when he worried the Church wasn't focusing enough on spirituality in training priests

#### 4. Autonomy
- Independence to advance novel causes and experiment
- Can take risks that businesses can't justify to shareholders
- No pressure to maximize profits

#### 5. Funding
- Voluntary support creates deep satisfaction for donors
- **Example**: Charles Li, whose scholarship transformed his life from oil rig worker to CEO of Hong Kong Stock Exchange

---

### Chapter 3: The Worst of Times - Weaknesses of Nonprofits

The **dark side** of those same five qualities:

#### 1. Mission → Can Become Stale or Misguided
- Missions that once made sense may outlive their usefulness
- Some nonprofits drift from their original purpose
- Programs continue long after they've stopped being effective

#### 2. Motivation → Leads to Dogmatism and Infighting
- **Example**: Environmental activists chaining themselves to Earthjustice's doors for being "too moderate"
- Peter Lehner: "People attack other green groups because it's easier than going after Exxon"
- Passion for the cause turns into attacks on allies
- People who should be allies become enemies over tactics

#### 3. Diversity → Morphs into Insularity
- Autonomy to serve specific communities becomes resistance to outside ideas
- Echo chambers develop
- Resistance to learning from other sectors

#### 4. Autonomy → Limits Accountability
- Hard to measure performance → misguided choices harder to expose
- No market forces to correct errors
- Less pressure to change with the times
- Flawed choices can persist indefinitely

#### 5. Funding → Constant Fundraising Pressure
- Money is tight at most nonprofits
- Fundraising diverts scarce resources from the mission
- Constant chase for next dollar

**The Result**: Mediocrity, not just misconduct. Many nonprofits don't advance their mission effectively. They deliver subpar results, are stuck in their ways, or are wracked with infighting.

### Chapter 4: PLAN - Run a Rigorous Planning Process

Every nonprofit needs an **annual planning process** to answer basic questions:

- What is working? What needs fixing?
- Which initiatives are "must-haves" vs "nice-to-haves"?
- How should we staff evolving priorities?
- How should we fund them?

**Key Insights**:
- **Stanley Rabin** (JDC board chair): The mission is eternal, but how we pursue it must constantly change with the times
- Schizer's approach as new CEO: Spent weeks interviewing insiders before making changes
- Common resistance: "We've always done it this way"

**The Planning Process**:
1. **Gather input** from board, staff, beneficiaries, experts
2. **Articulate** the mission and values
3. **Identify** what's working and what's not
4. **Set priorities** for the coming year
5. **Build a budget** aligned with priorities
6. **Communicate** the plan widely

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Planning by CEO in isolation
- Plans that sit in a drawer and aren't implemented
- Budgets that don't match stated priorities
- Treating planning as one-time exercise rather than annual discipline

---

### Chapter 5: PERSEVERE - Line Up Internal Support

Even a perfect plan fails if people don't support it.

**Cautionary Tale**:
Schizer asked a colleague to redesign curriculum budget-neutrally. She came back with a proposal requiring much more money—because she didn't agree with the constraint, she simply ignored it. Result: Wasted time, unhappy everyone.

**Key Insights**:
- People need to feel heard, not just told what to do
- Constraints must be understood and accepted, not just announced
- Building consensus takes time but is essential

**Strategies for Building Support**:

1. **Involve Key Stakeholders in Planning**
   - People support what they help create
   - Include board members, senior staff, possibly beneficiaries

2. **Communicate the "Why"**
   - Explain the reasoning behind decisions
   - Share the data and analysis

3. **Address Resistance Directly**
   - Acknowledge concerns
   - Explain trade-offs honestly

4. **Build Coalitions**
   - Find champions who can influence others
   - Work through informal networks

5. **Be Patient**
   - Real change takes time
   - Don't expect instant buy-in

### Chapter 6: PRIORITIZE - Set Priorities with "The Three Questions"

Nonprofits always have more good ideas than resources. They must choose.

**The Yacht Story**:
A donor offered Columbia Law School a yacht—but they couldn't sell it for years and had to use it in teaching. Schizer declined. A "floating law classroom" sounded like a sitcom premise, not a strategic asset.

#### THE THREE QUESTIONS

**1. Is it consistent with our mission?**
- Does this advance our core purpose?
- Example: Law school teaching on yachts ≠ legal education mission
- Even good ideas that don't fit the mission should be declined

**2. Do we have a competitive advantage?**
- Are we uniquely positioned to do this?
- Could someone else do it better?
- Focus on what you do uniquely well

**3. Will it make a meaningful difference?**
- Will this actually move the needle?
- Or just feel good to do?
- Be honest about impact

**Key Quotes**:
- Bishop Michael Saporito: "Nobody is ever overrun with great prosperity"—resources are always limited
- Peter Drucker: Well-run institutions don't just "do things right," they "do the right things"

**Hard Truths**:
- Saying yes to one thing means saying no to others
- Some worthy efforts simply can't be pursued
- The art is choosing wisely among good options
- Strategy is about saying no

### Chapter 7: PIVOT - Experiment and Innovate

Nonprofits must constantly search for better ways to work.

**COVID Pivot Story**:
Lee Goldman (dean of Columbia's medical school) had 4 months left after 14 years when COVID hit. Instead of gliding to the finish, he:
- Shifted to online instruction
- Banned travel to protect doctors
- Scrambled for PPE
- Redeployed 1,400 people to new roles

Equally important: He started planning immediately how to pivot BACK when crisis passed.

#### THE THREE PIVOT QUESTIONS

**1. The "WHO" - Do we have the right team?**
- Replace underperformers
- Bring in fresh talent
- Don't let loyalty to individuals trump mission effectiveness

**2. The "WHAT" - Are we pursuing the right goal?**
- Programs that once worked may no longer serve
- Needs change over time
- Be willing to end outdated programs

**3. The "HOW" - Is there a better approach?**
- New technologies
- New research on what works
- Changing circumstances
- Continuous improvement

**Key Insights**:
- "Pivot" isn't one-time—it's constant
- Don't continue on autopilot
- Even successful programs may need reinvention
- Experiments fail sometimes—that's okay
- Learn and try again
- The goal is not to avoid failure but to learn from it

**Why Nonprofits Resist Change**:
- "We've always done it this way"
- Staff are attached to existing programs
- Failure feels risky in mission-driven work
- "We're helping people" can shield programs from scrutiny

### Chapter 8: PUBLICIZE - Share Ideas and Hold Yourself Accountable

Bishop Michael discovered a book by two priests from Church of the Nativity in Maryland. Their innovative approach to engaging congregants so inspired him that he couldn't put it down—and their website showed what was possible.

#### THE CASE FOR PUBLICIZING

**1. Accountability**
- When you share goals and metrics, you create pressure to perform
- Transparency builds trust with donors and beneficiaries
- Public commitments are harder to break

**2. Learning from Others**
- Sharing successes helps other nonprofits
- Sharing failures helps others avoid mistakes
- Collective learning accelerates progress

**3. Inspiration**
- Your innovations can inspire others (like Bishop Michael)
- Reading about others' work sparks new ideas
- We all stand on each other's shoulders

**4. Recruitment**
- Clear communication attracts talented staff
- Donors want to support organizations with clear impact
- Transparency signals confidence

#### WHAT TO PUBLICIZE
- Your mission and theory of change
- What you're trying to achieve
- How you measure success
- Actual results (good AND bad)
- Lessons learned
- What you would do differently

**Common Objections (and Why They're Wrong)**:
- "Our donors don't want to hear about failures" → Wrong, they want honesty
- "Competitors might steal our ideas" → The goal is mission impact, not competitive advantage
- "It takes too much time" → It's essential to the work
- "We'll look bad" → Honesty builds more trust than perfection

### Chapter 9: PARTNER - Raise More Money by Involving Donors

Charles Best (DonorsChoose): "80% of people see fundraising as demeaning—someone needing to ingratiate themselves." This is the wrong mindset.

#### THE RIGHT MINDSET
- You're offering donors a valuable service: advancing their ideals
- Joe Shenker's gracious words when giving: "Thank you for the opportunity"
- Donors are PARTNERS in the mission, not ATMs
- Fundraising is about shared values, not transactions

#### WHAT DONORS WANT

**1. Personal Connection**
- Stories, not statistics
- Names and faces, not numbers
- Example: "You helped Maria learn to read" not "We served 10,000 people"
- Emotional resonance matters

**2. Impact Information**
- What did their gift achieve?
- How do you know?
- Be specific about outcomes

**3. Involvement**
- Opportunities to engage beyond writing checks
- Seeing the work firsthand
- Meeting beneficiaries or staff
- Feeling part of the team

**4. Respect**
- Treat donors as partners, not ATMs
- Listen to their perspectives
- Value their input, not just their money

#### FUNDRAISING REALITIES
- It's hard work, but essential
- Most giving comes from a small number of donors (Pareto principle)
- Retention matters more than acquisition
- People give to people, not institutions
- Relationships matter more than技巧 (techniques)

#### THE ASK
- Be specific about what you need
- Show how their gift will make a difference
- Make it easy to give
- Say thank you—and mean it
- Report back on impact

### Chapter 10: Conclusion - Saving the World Together

Bringing out the best in nonprofits is a "labor of love"—but it's still labor.

#### SCHIZER'S PERSONAL CONNECTION
- Named after grandfather David Schizer, born in Ukraine village of Dzhuryn
- Grandfather orphaned young, father murdered in pogrom
- Teenager David raised siblings, sold vegetables, always had nose in a book
- Family history fuels Schizer's commitment to education and humanitarian work

#### THE AUTHOR'S JOURNEY
- **Columbia Law School**: Dean during 2008 crisis, now professor
- **JDC**: CEO for 3 years, returned to Columbia
- Both organizations taught him hard lessons about leadership
- Learned that good intentions aren't enough

#### RECAP: THE SIX Ps

1. **PLAN** - Annual rigorous planning to set strategy
2. **PERSEVERE** - Build internal support for change
3. **PRIORITIZE** - Use the three questions to choose wisely
4. **PIVOT** - Constantly experiment and innovate
5. **PUBLICIZE** - Share goals, results, and lessons
6. **PARTNER** - Involve donors as true partners

#### THE BIG PICTURE
- Nonprofits are essential to society—$2.5T, 1.5M organizations in US alone
- They tackle problems government and business can't or won't
- Mediocrity is common, but not inevitable
- With discipline and heart, they can achieve extraordinary things

#### FINAL MESSAGE
When we're passionate about a cause, we want to advance it as effectively as possible. The point isn't to celebrate our good intentions, but to **GET THE JOB DONE**. Head AND heart, not head OR heart.

"Saving the world" is ambitious—but together, one nonprofit at a time, we can make real progress.

The question isn't whether we mean well, but whether we do well.
