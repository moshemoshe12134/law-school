interest legislation systematically overlook how markets protect investors. Those who emphasize the power of markets often understate the costs of using markets and compare the real securities
laws against hypothetical markets. The appropriate comparision is
not regulation against market but one kind of regulation against
another. But for the national securities laws, the regulation of securities would be in the hands of states and judges. We offer some
reasons to believe that regulation in this alternative mode might be
less satisfactory than the regulation we have now. Thus we are unable to reject either the interest-group or the public interest explanation of securities regulation.
I.

THE FEDERAL PROHIBITION AGAINST FRAUD

A.

The Market Without Legal Intervention

Fraud reduces allocative efficiency. So too does any deficiency of
information. Accurate information is necessary to ensure that
money moves to those who can use it most effectively and that
investors make optimal choices about the contents of their portfolios. A world with fraud, or without adequate truthful information,
is a world with too little investment, and in the wrong things to
boot.
Securities are claims to the future income of firms. The problem
in selling securities is that this income is subject to many risks,
and no entrepreneur can make a binding promise about the
amount of income the firm will yield in all possible circumstances.
The entrepreneur or managerial team, however, has better information than the prospective investor about both the nature of
these contingencies and how the firm will fare under them. Some
business prospects have higher expected returns than others; some
managers will produce more than others out of any given business
prospect. The market is inefficient unless it matches projects,
managers, and funds until, at the margin, the returns are equal.
The better prospect-manager combinations should attract more
funds until this equality condition is satisfied.
Yet how does an investor recognize the better combinations?
Unless people who offer the "better securities" (those representing
claims in the superior combinations) can distinguish themselves
from others, investors will view all securities as average. Higher
quality securities will sell at prices lower than they would if infor-

mation were available costlessly, and there will be too little investment in good ventures. Meanwhile, low-quality securities will attract too much money. It will be cheap to offer a low-quality
security; such offerings will be overcompensated. "Lemons" will
dominate the market as the quality of investments offered deteriorates.' No firm could recover the costs of offering high-quality securities. Investors and society both lose. This is roughly the picture
painted by many proponents of the securities laws.
One cannot leap from the difficulties of a market with asymmetric information to the conclusion that there is need for regulation-even such mild regulation as a prohibition of fraud. There
are ways by which the sellers of high quality securities can identify
themselves. One is to disclose information demonstrating quality.
The buyer can verify some of this information, and this verification will lend credence to the rest. Verification will not work perfectly, though. Sometimes a firm must withhold information in order to avoid giving commercially valuable secrets to rivals. A firm
thus will be hard pressed to convince buyers of the value of some
secret production process or new but unreleased product. The
other problem is that low quality sellers can mimic the disclosure
of ascertainable facts while making bogus statements about things
buyers cannot verify. The low quality firms erode the informational content of the disclosures of other firms, and again consumers cannot identify the high quality investments.1
Indeed, in securities markets only a limited amount of information can be verified at all. Investors cannot "inspect" a business
venture in a way that enables them to deduce future profits and
6 See Ackerlof, The Market for "Lemons": Qualitative Uncertainty and the Market
Mechanism, 84 Q.J. Econ. 488 (1970).
7 This problem is more serious for securities than for most physical goods because of the
difficulty of verification. A seller of a house must expect many buyers to verify statements
about square footage, termites, and structural flaws. A seller of charcoal does not expect the
buyer to test on the spot whether the charcoal will ignite without lighter fluid, but any
misstatement will affect the probability of repeat purchases, and so the seller has little incentive to misrepresent. Many sellers have competitiors anxious to expose misstatements.
All of these are effective in controlling the release of information no matter what the law
does about fraud. See R. Posner, The Regulation of Advertising by the FTC (1973); Darby
& Karni, Free Competition and the Optimal Amount of Fraud, 16 J.L. & Econ. 67 (1973);
Nelson, Advertising as Information, 82 J. Pol. Econ. 729 (1974). But because each security is
an interest in a unique project, neither competitors' statements nor the prospect of repeat
purchases will impose restraints, and it is very hard for a buyer to verify statements before
the sale.

risks. Investors do not even want to inspect; they seek to be passive recipients of an income stream, not to be private investigators.
When investors spend time and resources inspecting, each one's effort will duplicate another's. A system of inspection by buyers
would forfeit much of the benefit of the division of labor.
Even after the business has been in operation for some time, it is
hard to tell whether an unexpected outcome was attributable to
changed conditions or luck rather than to a misdescription of the
prospects. True, information about how a whole industry is doing
will provide a basis for comparison so that claims of a member of
the industry can be checked. Some of the firms' managers and promoters are "repeat players," so they will seek to preserve their reputations by telling the truth. Even so, it is possible that promoters
may find the gains from one-shot deception greater than the
reputational loss. It follows that some firms will find fraud to be
the project with the highest net present value.
High quality firms must take additional steps to convince investors of their quality. One traditional step is to allow outsiders to
review the books and records and to have these outsiders certify
the accuracy of the firms' representations. The accountant who
certifies the books of many firms has a reputational interest-and
thus a possible loss-much larger than the gains to be made from
slipshod or false certification of a particular firm.8 Similarly, firms
may sell their securities through investment bankers who inspect
the firm's prospects, put their money on the line in buying the
stock for resale, and put their reputations on the line in making
representations to customers.9 The larger the auditor or investment banker relative to an issuer, the more effective these methods
of verification are. This suggests why investment bankers form
syndicates to distribute securities even though any one could handle them alone. Syndication increases the amount of reputational
capital put behind the offering.
The firms themselves can take actions that render their disclo-

sures more believable. One such action is to ensure that their managers hold substantial quantities of their stock. This can be accomplished by stock options or by "cheap stock" when the firm goes
public, as well as by inducing managers to buy stock in the market.
Then if the firm does poorly, the managers lose with the other investors. The higher the quality of the stock, the more of it managers will be willing to hold in undiversified portfolios; the more
managers hold, the more willing other investors will be to believe
the firm's statements. 10 Another action open to the firm is to issue
debt, which could lead to bankruptcy. This strategy might seem
implausible, but consider that bankruptcy imposes very high costs
on managers' portfolios and careers. By using leverage to increase
the risk of bankruptcy, the firms with the best prospects and thus
the lowest bankruptcy costs can certify themselves to investors,
Managers can establish a certification method by promising a
high-payout policy too. This is attractive to investors because the
consistent payment of dividends forces managers to return to the
capital markets repeatedly in order to continue operations, and on
the return visits the firm must again undergo careful scrutiny by
the new investors.12 Finally, managers could warrant their statements in the traditional way: They could make legally enforceable
promises (perhaps backed up by insurers) to pay the investors if
the firm does worse than promised (perhaps, say, in a comparison
against a market index). The person vouching for the payment obligation would look very carefully at the firm's claims, so that only
high-quality firms could find solvent guarantors, and the investors
would be protected.
Even in a market without a rule against fraud, these methods of
verification would offer investors substantial protection and make
it possible for high quality firms to raise money. Investors, after
all, need not donate cash to new firms. They can put their money
in government securities or bank accounts with no risk; they can

invest in regulated public utilities that have very little risk; they
can purchase land or other productive assets. New or less known
firms can obtain money only if they offer packages more attractive
than those already existing.
B. The Effects of a Rule Against Fraud
For the reasons we have spelled out, a rule against fraud is not
an essential ingredient of securities markets. Each of these certification methods is costly, however. Auditing, investment banking,
and underwriting firms are very expensive to establish and operate; debt and dividend strategies entail transaction costs; managers
must be paid extra to induce them to hold undiversified portfolios,
and their risky position may lead them to make inferior investment decisions later on; direct verification of claims by thousands
of buyers may be the most expensive of all.
A rule against fraud can reduce these costs, especially for new
firms. The penalty for fraud makes it more costly for low-quality
firms to mimic high-quality ones by making false disclosures. An
antifraud rule imposes low or no costs on honest, high quality
firms. Thus it makes it possible for high quality firms to offer warranties at lower cost. 13 The informational warranty, if enforced,
makes it unnecessary for buyers to verify information or for sellers
to undertake expensive certification. 4 The expenses of offering
high quality securities go down while the expenses of passing off
low quality securities rise.
The rule against fraud will not drive the costs of the high-quality
firms to zero, however, because the rule may be underenforced.
Firms still will use some additional certification devices. Moreover,
a fraud rule does not have much effect when a firm is silent. The
silence of a firm whose securities are trading in secondary markets
could mean no news, bad news, or good news that cannot be disclosed because disclosure would benefit rivals. Investors have incentives to investigate to find the meaning of the silence, and firms
will incur costs either to preserve secrecy or to communicate the
tenor of the news without saying too much. The fraud rule and

Virginia Law Review

[Vol. 70:669

other verification methods are complements in some respects, substitutes in others.
Antifraud rules also impose costs of their own. Enforcement
costs (investigative, prosecutorial, and judicial staffs) are obvious.
The costs of overenforcement or inaccurate enforcement are harder
to see but no less real. Start with an extreme case of inaccurate
enforcement. Suppose that the probability of being prosecuted for
any given statement is .55 if the statement is false, .45 if the statement is true. This could come about if, for example, the prosecutors and courts adopt a theory of "strict liability" and penalize all
firms whose projections of profit turned out poorly. Because market conditions cause many plans, even those well laid and truthfully described, to fail, while firms that tell lies could succeed,
prosecutions would be brought against honest firms, and many dishonest would escape.
The deterrent force of any rule is the difference between how
the rule treats those who obey and how it treats those who disobey.
If the difference is small-if, for example, a person driving at fiftyfive miles per hour is only a little less likely to be charged with
speeding than a person driving at eighty-five-then the rule does
not deter. If there are gains from violating the rule, one may as
well violate it. The world of inaccurate enforcement is similar to
the world of no enforcement. Statements are no longer trustworthy
unless the firm undertakes the costly certification and verification
methods described in the previous section, and even truth-tellers
will say as little as possible in order to avoid paying the penalty for
lying. The higher the penalty for the offense, the more discriminating the enforcement must be in order to prevent both deterring
appropriate behavior and stimulating undesired behavior. This is
one reason why the procedures used in criminal law require a
higher degree of proof.
Overenforcement is similar to undiscriminating enforcement. For
any offense, there is an optimal level of enforcement at which the
costs of expending an additional enforcement dollar equal the
gains from reducing the incidence of the offense. The optimal level
of enforcement allows some violations to occur because the costs of
stamping out these violations exceed the costs of the violations
themselves. Excessive penalties for fraud-especially if these penalties are available in actions brought by private plaintiffs-can

HeinOnline -- 70 Va. L. Rev. 678 1984

1984]

Mandatory Disclosure

lead both to overenforcement and to excessive deterrence of truthful statements.15
The rule against fraud, then, is most beneficial when enforcement costs are low and when it is possible to separate untruths
from statements that, although true, do not accurately predict the
future. Enforcement costs are least, and the chance of error lowest,
when prosecutions are concentrated on verifiable statements of
fact rather than on predictions. The SEC's administration of the
securities laws has emphasized the making of accurate historical
statements rather than projections, which are not required and are
sheltered from prosecution by a "safe harbor." This approach is
consistent with one in which fraud rules are used where they yield
maximum net benefits.1"
C. Why is the Rule Against Fraud National?
In 1933 every state had a rule against fraud. What, then, was the
point of the many new rules contained in the '33 and '34 Acts? The
Acts' supporters usually say that the national rules were necessary
because the state rules were "ineffective" (witness the discovery of
frauds), but this is not a good explanation. The existence or even
increase of reported frauds no more proves that the state laws
against fraud were "ineffective" than the existence of murder
shows that state criminal law is "ineffective" and should be replaced with a national murder statute enforced by a Federal Homicide Commission.
The justification of federal legislation lies, rather, in the efficiency of enforcing in one case all claims that arise out of a single
transaction. Many new issues of securities are sold to purchasers in
several states; even issues initially sold within a single state ultimately find their way into the hands of out-of-state owners, if only
because the owners move. Thus almost all substantial firms' securities sell in interstate markets. If claims arising out of these securities were litigated where plaintiffs resided, there would be multiple

(forthcoming); Landes & Posner, The Private Enforcement of Law, 4 J. Legal Stud. 1
(1975).
16There has been criticism of the SEC from all quarters concerning its emphasis on historical fact. Our discussion of the costs and benefits of fraud rules suggests that prosecutions are appropriately focused on statements of "hard" fact, while private certification and
verification mechanisms deal with matters of projection and opinion.

680

Virginia Law Review

[Vol. 70:669

cases for every security, with the possibility of inconsistent decisions and inconsistent legal standards. Claims of fraud usually involve written documents, and there is good reason to have the
identical claim litigated in multiple forums.
The securities laws create nationwide service of process and have
a liberal venue rule that permits litigation to consolidate all defendants and all claims in a single forum.17 The class action device
created by Rule 23 of the Rules of Civil Procedure makes it easy to
bring all plaintiffs together. We discuss in Part III some of the
reasons why a single rule of law about what must and cannot be
disclosed may be beneficial. For now it is enough to note that the
federal prohibition of fraud would be beneficial even if the single
federal suit enforced multiple rules based on state law.

A.

MANDATORY DIsCLOSURE

Disclosure and the Public Goods Aspect of Information

In a world with an anti-fraud rule but no mandatory disclosure
system, firms could remain silent with impunity. 8 If they disclosed, they could do so in any way they wished, provided they did
not lie. They could attempt to sell securities with ads in glossy
magazines and on television featuring sexy models or herds of
bulls, as sellers of other products (including brokerage services) do.
A mandatory disclosure system substantially limits firms' ability
to remain silent. Just as importantly, it controls the time, place,
and manner of disclosure. Firms must wait until they file a registration statement before saying anything that may be construed as
touting (the "gun jumping" rule); they must wait until the registration statement is effective and a prospectus has been delivered
before putting anything else in writing (the "free writing" rule);
they must mail prospectuses and proxy statements at designated
times but may not resort to ads on television.
What does a mandatory disclosure system add to the prohibition
17 15 U.S.C. § 78aa (1982). See Leroy v. Great W. United Corp., 443 U.S. 173, 178-79
(1979).
18 This is something of an overstatement, because the distinction between failure to in-

form and misrepresentation is not always clear. Failure to speak may be viewed as an implied representation that "nothing has changed." The securities laws recognize this by penalizing the omission of material facts necessary to make the actual disclosures not
misleading. We return to this in Part IHI.

HeinOnline -- 70 Va. L. Rev. 680 1984

Mandatory Disclosure

of fraud? The implicit public-interest justification for disclosure
rules is that markets produce "too little" information about securities when the only rule is one against fraud. One often hears the
assertion that information is a "public good," meaning that it can
be used without being used up and that the producer of information cannot exclude others from receiving the benefits. If the producer of information cannot obtain all of its value, too little will be
produced. It seems to follow that there are virtues in a rule requiring production of all information that would be forthcoming were
gains fully appropriable.
This rationale gets us only so far. For one thing, it proves too
much. No one can fully appropriate the value of information about
toothpaste, but there is no federal rule about disclosing the efficacy of toothpaste in preventing cavities. Why are securities different? We leave the other products to competitive markets because
of a conclusion that people who make or use a product (or test it as
Consumers' Union does) will obtain enough of the gains from information to make the markets reasonably efficient.
Similarly, those who learn about a security may profit from their
information. They cannot obtain all of the benefits, because others
in the market will infer the news, and the price of the securities
will adjust. The new price will "contain" the news, preventing the
person who first learned it from taking further gains. This also
means, however, that the value of news decays very quickly in securities markets; the information is "used up" as subsequent people see things, and these people then have their own incentives to
go out and find information.19
The more sophisticated version of the public goods explanation
is that although investors produce information, they produce both
too much and too little. They produce too little because the benefits are imperfectly appropriable. If information is worth one hundred dollars to investors as a group, but no one can capture more
than ten dollars of gains, then no one will obtain more than ten
dollars worth of information. Investors produce too much information, though, if several create the same ten dollars bit of informa" See Manne, supra note 4, at 42-43. The dynamic process by which stock markets impound information in prices, extinguishing the value of "old news" while creating incentives
to find "new news," is described in Grossman & Stiglitz, On the Impossibility of Informationally Efficient Markets, 70 Am. Econ. Rev. 383 (1980).

[Vol. 70:669

tion (redundant production). Mandatory disclosure will prevent redundant production of information, the argument concludes.
The other source of excessive production is the gain available
from forecasting the future. Some information, such as the quarterly earnings of a firm, offers opportunities for trading gains; the
person who learns the news first can make great profits. In one
important sense, though, the information is worthless. Trading on
news that is bound to come out anyway does not change the future
or lead to better investment in new securities. The price will ultimately change to reflect the true earnings. That it changes a day or
so quicker is not of much moment for allocative efficiency. The
lure of trading profits may induce people to spend a lot of effort
and other resources "beating the market." Much of this is waste
because the profit opportunity is larger than the efficiency gains
from expediting the transition of prices.20 The argument concludes
by observing that the prompt disclosure of information by the affected firm will extinguish the trading opportunity. When everyone
knows the truth, no one can speculate on it. Investors as a group
would pay to have these trading gains (and the costly search for
information) eliminated.2 ' What better way to do this then
mandatory disclosure by the firm that knows the truth?
These arguments have a common problem: they do not link the
benefit of disclosure and the benefit of mandatory disclosure. If
disclosure is worthwhile to investors, the firm can profit by providing it. The firm is in privity with its investors, and the Coase The20See Hirshleifer, The Private and Social Value of Information and the Reward to Inventive Activity, 61 Am. Econ. Rev. 561 (1971). There has been a substantial dispute about the
interpretation and magnitude of this effect, but we need not enter that debate here.
1 This is a commonplace observation in the literature on rent seeking. Imagine 10 equally
qualified firms competing for a radio license worth $1,000. Each one's chance to obtain that
license is worth $100, and each will spend up to $100 in promotional and lobbying expenses
to seek the license. The net value to each firm is $100 less the expenses. So long as one firm
lobbies, the others must do so too. The firms would pay for someone to stop all of them
from engaging in the lobbying; if no firm expended resources the opportunity would have an
expected value of $100 for each firm. The same is true in securities markets. Each investor
may try to get an edge on the others, but so long as these efforts just anticipate the future
and do not yield better investments initially, they are waste and everyone gains if they are
eliminated. See Tullock, Efficient Rent Seeking, in Towards a Theory of the Rent-Seeking
Society 97 (J. Buchanan, R. Tollison & G. Tullock eds. 1980). See also Barzel, Some Fallacies in the Interpretation of Information Costs, 20 J.L. & Econ. 291 (1977) (showing how
markets develop solutions to problems of inefficient search); Kenney & Klein, The Economics of Block Booking, 27 J.L. & Econ. 497 (1983) (showing the same).

orem suggests that firm and investors can strike a mutually beneficial bargain.22 A decision by the firm effectively "coordinates" the
acts of many investors who could not bargain directly.
To see how this works, take a simple example of a firm that
wants to issue new securities. 23 The firm has a project (say, the
manufacture of a new computer) that it expects to be profitable. If
the firm simply asked for money without disclosing the project and
managers involved, however, it would get nothing. Investors would
assume the worst, because, they would reason that if the firm had
anything good to say for itself it would do so. Silence means bad
news. A firm with a good project, seeking to distinguish itself from
a firm with a mediocre project (or no project at all), would disclose
the optimal amount of information. That is, it would disclose more
and more so long as the cost of disclosure (both direct costs of dissemination and indirect costs of giving information to rivals) was
worthwhile to investors as a whole.
The firm deals with all actual and prospective investors. Unlike
an investor who deals only in a portion of a firm's stock, and thus
cannot capture the full value of information, the firm controls all
of its investments and can appropriate the full value of information. The firm that discloses more can sell its stock for more, indeed for as much more as the full value of all information.
The process works for bad news as well as for good. Once the
firm starts disclosing it cannot stop short of making any critical
revelation, because investors always assume the worst. It must disclose the bad with the good, lest investors assume that the bad is
even worse than it is. And the firm cannot stand on its say-so
alone. Mere disclosure would be enough if the rule against fraud
were perfectly enforced, but it is not. Thus the firm uses the verification and certification devices described in Part I. Given these
devices, a rule compelling disclosure seems redundant, and if the
fraud penalty and verification devices do not work, a rule compelling disclosure is not apt to be enforceable either.

'S The economics of this have been formalized by Grossman, supra note 14, and Grossman & Hart, Disclosure Laws and Takeover Bids, 35 J. Fin. 323 (1980). Although the formal
models assume that the cost of transmitting information is zero and that a prohibition of
fraud is perfectly enforced, we show in the text that the broad outlines of the argument do
not depend on these assumptions. See also Benston, Required Periodic Disclosure Under
the Securities Acts and the Proposed Federal Securities Code, 33 U. Miami L. Rev. 1471
(1979), for a similar exposition.

[Vol. 70:669

The principle of self-induced disclosure as a solution to the lack
of property rights in information applies to trading in the secondary market as well as to the initial issuance of stock. The firm's
investors always want to be able to sell their stock in the
aftermarket for the highest price. Their ability to do so depends on
a flow of believable information (otherwise potential buyers reduce
the bid prices, assuming the worst). For most information about a
firm, the firm itself can create and distribute the knowledge at less
cost than the shareholders, and the firm's decision, because it reflects the value to all shareholders, will be correct at the margin. A
firm that wants the highest possible price when it issues stock
must take all cost-justified steps to make the stock valuable in the
aftermarket, so it must make a believable pledge to continue
24
disclosing.
The evidence bears this out. Firms have been disclosing the most
important facts about themselves-and certifying these facts
through third parties-as long as there have been firms. It is possible to trace the use of auditors back to the beginning of the corporation, and at the time the '34 Act, which created the requirement
of annual disclosure by listed companies, became law, every firm
traded on the national markets made voluminous public disclosures certified by independent auditors.2 5 Between 1934 and 1964,
annual disclosure was required only of those firms traded on national exchanges. (In 1964 the statute was amended to cover all
firms with more than a specified number of investors.) Firms could
avoid disclosure by delisting or not listing initially. Nonetheless,
firms eagerly listed themselves on an exchange and disclosed; firms
that were not listed also disclosed substantial amounts of data, following the pattern set by those covered by the statute. Even today,
the securities of state and local governments are exempt from the

they fail to take any cost-justified steps to reduce the net costs of management. Jensen &

problems to which we return.

Mandatory Disclosure

mandatory disclosure rules, yet these issuers routinely supply voluminous information to purchasers.
Disclosure for the purpose of stilling investors' doubts also
reduces (to the appropriate degree) investors' incentives to search
too much for trading information. The problem, as we described it
above, is that knowing the future creates profit opportunities without making investors as a group better off. Because searching out
such information is costly, investors as a group gain if firms disclose so as to minimize the opportunities and thus the incentives to
search. The net return on a security is its gross return (dividends
plus any liquidating distribution) less the cost of information and
transactions in holding the security. A firm can increase this net
return as easily by reducing the cost of holding the stock as well as
by increasing its business profits. Firms that promise to make disclosures for this purpose will prosper relative to others, because
their investors incur relatively lower costs and can be more passive
with safety. The more convincing the promise, the more investors
will pay for the stock.
B. Limitations on the Self-Interest Model of Disclosure
That information is a "public good" means that investors acting
independently do the wrong amount of information-gathering, but
for reasons we have explained, the self-interest of firms' managers
lead them to supply roughly the amount of information investors
as a group desire. This amount is "rough," however, because of the
certification and verification costs in the supply of information. If
disclosure rules, like fraud rules, could reduce the costs, then firms'
disclosure would be improved. We return to this in Part III. There
is one other reason why firms' disclosures may not be optimal:
third party effects.
The information produced by one firm for its investors may be
valuable to investors in other firms. Firm A's statements may reveal something about the industry in which Firm A operates-if
only the size of Firm A's anticipated production-that other participants in the industry can use in planning their own operations.
There may be other collateral benefits to investors in rival firms.
Yet Firm A cannot charge the investors in these other firms for the
benefits, although they would be willing to pay for them. Because
they cannot be charged, the information will be underproduced.
The problem is related to the prisoners' dilemma. The firms and

HeinOnline -- 70 Va. L. Rev. 685 1984

Virginia Law Review

investors, acting as a group, would want the firms to disclose information with both firm and industry-specific components. Each
firm acting individually will not do so, in part because the others
would get a free ride and in part because some of the information
(such as that pertaining to new products) may give a competitive
advantage to rivals. Each firm would be willing to disclose, but
only if all others were required to do likewise. Then the costs and
any business risks would be distributed more evenly. In the absence of some requirement or strong inducement to disclose, each
firm will want to be a holdout.
There is a similar free riding problem in the disclosure of information that facilitates comparisons among firms. Firm C may
know something that makes it attractive relative to D. It cannot
convey this information effectively, however, without conveying information about D's plans and prospects. The information about D
will redound partly to the benefit of present or prospective investors in D, and Firm C cannot obtain compensation. Firm C could
appropriate part of the gain by buying or selling D's stock, but this
is a costly transaction, and Firm C could not appropriate the full
gain without owning D, E, F, G, and so on, outright. An increase in
the size of firms to allow greater internalization of information has
other costs, including monopoly and a reduction in investors' ability to diversify their holdings.
Firm C also encounters difficulty in appropriating the value of
information affecting risk-return characteristics. The less the degree of difference among firms, the more spillover the disclosures
of one firm will have, and the poorer this firm's incentives to disclose. Many firms will have similar risk-return characteristics.
Some form of collective action (whether or not through the government) could be beneficial in principle here. Which method of tackling the collective action problem has the lowest net costs is an
empirical problem.
Or suppose there is an optimal format for communicating information to investors. Some disclosures are easier to understand,
verify, etc., than others, while some disclosures tend more to hide
than to reveal information. If contracts among all investors in society could be written costlessly, the investors would require all
firms to identify and use the optimal format of disclosure. The
costs may be too high, though, for one firm acting on its own. The
optimal form of disclosure may entail use of some specialized lan-

guage (one can think of accounting principles, with their detailed
definitions, as a specialized disclosure language), yet no one firm
can obtain a large share of the benefits of inventing and employing
this language; others will be able to use the format without charge.
Sometimes, too, the ease of using a given method of disclosure will
depend on other firms adopting the same format, so as to facilitate
comparisons across investments. Other firms may not be anxious
to cooperate.
Mandatory disclosure rules promulgated by the government are
one means to achieve standardization, but it does not follow that
mandatory disclosure is necessary. Markets frequently devise ingenious solutions to problems of information. Indeed, the problems
faced by sellers of securities are not much different from those involved in bringing new products to market. Mass sale of records
and stereo systems was facilitated by the development of standard
record speeds. Color television was not feasible until manufacturers and broadcasters agreed on a standard method of transmission.
The new laser compact disk players are greatly aided in competing
against tapes and records by the standard promulgated by Phillips,
the holder of an important patent. Sometimes trade associations
may devise such standards, as the electronics industry and, in part,
the accounting industry have done. Whether standardization may
be achieved more cheaply by private or governmental responses is
an empirical question.
C. Private or Competitive Methods of
Creating Optimal Disclosure
1.

Informational Intermediaries

We have assumed so far that firms essentially act on their own
in creating and communicating information to investors. Sometimes firms will not disclose because the costs of this self-help exceed the value of the information. Sometimes they will not disclose
because the information would decrease rather than increase the
firms' value, even though investors would gain from having the
knowledge; information about a new product or a new technology
may be in this category. Because of these "good" reasons for nondisclosure, investors cannot infer unambiguously that no news is
bad news; the power of the self-interest model of disclosure is re-

duced, and high-quality firms will have trouble distinguishing their
offerings from those of low-quality firms.
Informational intermediaries are a partial solution to these difficulties. Consider the case of a firm that wants to raise money to
take advantage of a technological breakthrough, the details of
which it cannot disclose. This firm may disclose the information to
an underwriter, which will price the securities appropriately. Investors realize that underwriters may have information that is not disclosed to the public and that they have strong reputational interests in not deceiving customers. Investors then pay more for these
securities than they would for those of similar firms that had not
made such breakthroughs. Firms also can spread the news indirectly-although not as well, because of the weaker reputational
interests of the intermediaries-by disclosing portions to investment analysts or other intermediaries, who communicate to the
public by making recommendations rather than by setting out
details. 6
Accountants also serve as intermediaries. We have emphasized
before that accountants reduce the cost of verifying information
because they put their reputations behind the accuracy of a firm's
disclosures. Moreover, to the extent accountants agree on a common language, they serve the function of standardizing (reducing
the costs of) any amount of disclosure. Accountants spread over all
firms the costs of creating and maintaining the standard language.
Of course accountants may face pressures from individual firms to
misuse their language, or they may be unable to agree on a common language at all; governmental intervention may reduce these
costs of agreement and enforcement.
Informational intermediaries obviously cannot ensure accuracy
or completeness of information. Their employees may be incompetent or deceived; they review events periodically rather than continuously, so the situation may change between their inspection
and the time any investor acts in reliance. But any other disclosure

invest in other firms, see Campbell & Kracaw, Information Production, Market Signalling,
and the Theory of Financial Intermediation, 35 J. Fin. 863 (1980). See also Benston, Accounting Standards in the United States and the United Kingdom: Their Nature, Causes,
and Consequences, 28 Vand. L. Rev. 235 (1975); Benston, The Market for Public Accounting Services: Demand, Supply, and Regulation, 2 Acct. J. 2 (1979), for a treatment very close
to the one we offer below.

device has these problems as well. The relevant point is that the
informational intermediaries increase the amount of accurate information about firms that can be conveyed to investors.
2. Informed Traders
Some traders know more than others. Insiders and those who
receive information from insiders, brokers, those who search out
tidbits and draw inferences, and those who purchase information
from the better informed (such as analysts and money managers)
are informed traders. People become informed to "beat the market" and earn superior returns. Their ability to earn these returns
is limited, though, by the fact that other investors follow the same
strategy and trade on what they learn. Other traders become informed, and the very act of trading-moving the price of the stock
toward the one the informed traders think is "right"-causes the
price of the stock to impound the value of the information these
traders possess. When the price reaches a level at which informed
traders are indifferent between being buyers and being sellers, the
price conveys the information about the firm more effectively and
cheaply than direct disclosure. Trading will never be completely
revealing; uninformed traders may not be able to tell whether particular trades are motivated by new information or by portfolio adjustments. Nonetheless, trading and not trading by informed 2par7
ties supplies other investors with a great deal of information.
3. Stock Exchange
Organized exchanges reduce the costs of transacting. 28 By making it easier for parties with different beliefs about the future to
transact, organized exchanges increase liquidity and reduce the unnecessary risk of investing. The greater the liquidity of the secondary market, the more successful the exchange. Because the success
of an exchange depends on the amount of trading, exchanges have
incentives to adopt rules governing trade that operate to the benefit of investors. Such rules attract more trades, reducing the cost
