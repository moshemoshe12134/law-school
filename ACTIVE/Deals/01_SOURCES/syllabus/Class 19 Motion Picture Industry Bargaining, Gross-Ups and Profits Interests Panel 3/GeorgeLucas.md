[**George
Lucas**](https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/directors/george-lucas-net-worth/)
is a very rich man. In fact, out of all the extremely rich celebrities
on the planet, George Lucas is the most extremely rich celebrity, with a
personal net worth of **\$5.4 billion**. That\'s enough to make him
\$1.7 billion richer than his good buddy [**Steven
Spielberg**](https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/directors/steven-spielberg-net-worth/).
That makes him \$1.9 billion richer than

What\'s perhaps most incredible about the Lucas fortune, at least
compared to other entertainment billionaires, is that George essentially
made vast majority of his fortune solely from one idea: **Star Wars**.

As a director, George\'s resume is actually pretty thin. Technically
speaking, Lucas has only directed six feature films in his entire
career, and four of them were Star Wars movies. By comparison, Steven
Spielberg has directed more than 30 different feature films, many of
which went on to become some of the most successful classic films of all
time. So how did George Lucas generate such a huge personal fortune from
a single movie franchise?

It all comes down to one incredibly simple, yet amazingly brilliant
**billion-dollar decision** in 1973...

Prior to 1973, George Lucas was still very much struggling to make his
way in Hollywood. His first major directorial debut was 1971\'s *THX
1138*, which starred Robert Duvall in a futuristic world, where android
robots control society with drugs that suppress human emotions. Lucas\'
next movie was 1973\'s *American Graffiti*. Unlike *THX 1138, American
Graffiti* was a monster hit. It eventually became one of the most
profitable movies of all time, earning **\$200 million** with a budget
of just **\$775,000**. It was also nominated for an Academy Award for
Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Supporting
Actress and Best Editing. Lucas was now a hot commodity.

Lucas first had the idea for what he described as a \"western set in
space,\" called *The Star Wars*, in 1971. He worked on the script for
the next two years, while his personal debt mounted and his film career
floundered. After the massive success of *American Graffiti*, Lucas was
in the best possible position to negotiate for his next film. He earned
\$150,000 for directing *American Graffiti* and his managers encouraged
him to ask for a huge salary bump. Simultaneously, an executive at 20th
Century Fox studios, named Alan Ladd, Jr., loved *American Graffiti* but
did not understand this \"Star Wars\" concept. Despite the fact that no
other executive at Fox thought the movie would be a success, Ladd was
able to secure Lucas a deal to direct the film beginning in 1976 for a
budget of \$8.25 million. The final budget eventually swelled to \$11
million.

**The Brilliant Decision**

Thanks to the success of *American Graffiti*, Lucas was entitled to a
salary of \$500,000 for directing what was now being called simply
\"Star Wars.\" Instead of accepting the nearly 300% pay raise, George
approached the Fox executives with a proposition. George generously
offered to keep his salary at \$150,000 in exchange for **two**
seemingly insignificant requests: **#1)** That he retain all
merchandising rights, and **#2)** that he would retain the rights to any
sequels. As crazy as it sounds now, at the time this was actually a
fantastic deal for the studio. Fox had previously lost a fortune in the
merchandising business with monumental failure of 1967\'s *Doctor
Dolittle*, so they weren\'t exactly dying to get back into that world.
Moreover, merchandise just wasn\'t a meaningful revenue stream in
general back then. As for sequel rights, these were also not an
important factor for Fox considering the fact that no executive thought
the movie had a snowball\'s chance in hell of making money the first
time around. So off George went to finalize his script with \$150,000
and a what seemed like an incredibly naive contract in his pocket.

As we all know now, *Star Wars* was a **humongous** hit when it was
finally released in 1977. *Star Wars* went on to become one of the
highest grossing films of all time. When you adjust for inflation, *Star
Wars* is the second highest grossing movie in history. In six months,
the film had earned \$220 million in the United States alone (\$830
million in inflation adjusted dollars). To date, *Star Wars* has earned
\$775 million at the box office (\$2.5 billion after adjusting for
inflation).
