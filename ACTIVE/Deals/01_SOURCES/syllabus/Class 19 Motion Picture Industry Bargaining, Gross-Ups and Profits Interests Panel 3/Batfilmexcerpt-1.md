**YAFFE, J**.\--Phase I Statement of Decision

The Court divided the trial of this case into two phases. Phase I
consisted of a bench trial of plaintiffs\' non-jury claims. Those claims
primarily concern plaintiffs\' "Net Profits" participation in the Batman
motion pictures.

The plaintiffs are two individuals, Benjamin Melniker and Michael Uslan,
and the two corporations that furnish their services, Batfilm
Productions, Inc., and Franklin Enterprises, Ltd. The defendants are
Warner Bros. and Polygram Pictures, Inc.

In 1979, Mr. Melniker and Mr. Uslan obtained an option on the motion
picture rights to the Batman comic book characters. In November 1979,
they made a deal with Casablanca Productions (Polygram\'s predecessor)
for the development and production of a motion picture to be based on
those characters (the "Casablanca Agreement"). Under the Casablanca
Agreement, Mr. Melniker and Mr. Uslan were entitled to receive certain
fixed and contingent compensation if a Batman motion picture were
** \[\*2\] **produced.

In 1981, Polygram assigned to Warner Bros. its rights and obligations
under the Casablanca Agreement. In 1988, Mr. Melniker and Mr. Uslan and
Warner Bros. signed a written amendment to the Casablanca Agreement (the
"Warner Agreement"). Under the Warner Agreement, Mr. Melniker and Mr.
Uslan were entitled to receive \$ 300,000 in fixed compensation for
Batman, plus a \$ 100,000 "deferment" once the film generated a certain
level of receipts, plus 13% of the so-called "Net Profits," as defined
in an attachment to the Warner Agreement.

Warner Bros. has paid Messrs. Melniker and Uslan the \$ 300,000 fixed
fee and \$ 100,000 deferment. Under the Warner Agreement, Warner Bros.
has also paid Melniker and Uslan an additional \$ 700,000 in fixed fees
on two additional motion pictures (Batman Returns and Batman: Mask of
the Phantasm). Warner Bros. will have similar financial obligations to
plaintiffs on each additional Batman motion picture. Although Batman has
generated more revenue than any other Warner Bros. film, it has not
generated any "Net Profits" under plaintiffs\' contract. Melniker and
Uslan filed suit in 1992 claiming, inter alia, they were denied their
fair "Net Profits" compensation.

The ** \[\*3\] **primary claim . . . \[was\] the Eleventh Cause of
Action for a declaration that plaintiffs\' "Net Profits" definition is
unconscionable and, thus, unenforceable. . . .

In reviewing the evidence, the Court believed that Mr. Melniker and Mr.
Uslan had offered evidence to prove that the Warner Agreement was
contract of adhesion that should be strictly interpreted against Warner
Bros. and should not be interpreted in a way that would be contrary to
plaintiffs\' reasonable expectations.

But a contract of adhesion is a contract, and a contract of adhesion is
not the same as an unconscionable contract, which is no contract at all.
"Unconscionability" ** \[\*4\] **requires a far different level of
proof. The plaintiffs did not prove that they are to be relieved of
their contract with Warner Bros. on the ground of unconscionability.

Mr. Melniker negotiated the Warner Agreement on his and Mr. Uslan\'s
behalf. No one is less likely to have been coerced against his will into
signing a contract like the Warner Agreement than Mr. Melniker. This
former general counsel and senior executive of a major motion picture
studio (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) knew all the tricks of the trade; he knew
inside and out how these contracts work, what they mean, and how they
are negotiated.

Even with Mr. Melniker\'s knowledge and experience, plaintiffs complain
that Warner Bros. knew when the parties signed the Warner Agreement in
1988 that Batman would not generate "Net Profits." Plaintiffs did not
explain the relevance of this to the issue of whether their contract is
unconscionable. Even if they had, however, they failed to prove that
Warner Bros. knew in 1988 that Batman would not generate any "Net
Profits."

At the core of plaintiffs\' case is their argument that the contract was
not fair to them because Warner Bros. and others earned millions of
dollars on Batman and plaintiffs ** \[\*5\] **did not. The answer that
argument is that ever since the King\'s Bench decided Slade\'s Case in
1602, right down to today, courts do not refuse to enforce contracts or
remake contracts for the parties because the court or the jury thinks
that the contract is not fair.

That principle is not some medieval anachronism. This society, this
country, this culture operates on the basis of billions of bargains
struck willingly every day by people all across the country in all walks
of life. And if any one of those people could have their bargain
reexamined after the fact on the ground that it was not fair or on an
assertion that it was not fair, we would have a far different type of
society than we have now; we would have one that none of the parties to
this case would like very much.

When one talks about a motion picture and the claims of this type that
are made, they all have one thing in common: the plaintiff comes in and
says, "Without me, they would have had nothing, and look how they
treated me." But the process of making a motion picture consists of the
process of bargaining with many talented people on many different and
inconsistent bases, and making bargains with them that cannot rationally
** \[\*6\] **be compared one to another. It would not be good for the
motion picture business or for the parties to this case if any one of
those people on any motion picture could come back and ask a court to
remake the bargain that he made on the ground that he now asserts, after
the fact and in light of the success of the picture, that he was not
fairly treated in comparison with others. Whether a contract is fair is
not the issue. A contract is not unconscionable simply because it is not
fair. Plaintiffs claim that the Warner Agreement is unconscionable
within the meaning of [*[Civil Code section
1670.5]{.underline}*](https://plus.lexis.com/api/document?collection=statutes-legislation&id=urn:contentItem:5J6R-DPH1-66B9-84HK-00000-00&context=1530671).
To be unconscionable, a contract must "shock the conscience" or, as
plaintiffs alleged in paragraph 139(b) of their complaint, it must be
"harsh, oppressive, and unduly one-sided."

After considering all the evidence, the Court finds that the plaintiffs
have failed to prove that the Warner Agreement, taken as a whole, is
unconscionable.

That, however, is not the end of the inquiry that the Court must make.
Under [*[Civil Code section
1670.5]{.underline}*](https://plus.lexis.com/api/document?collection=statutes-legislation&id=urn:contentItem:5J6R-DPH1-66B9-84HK-00000-00&context=1530671),
if the evidence shows that any part of a contract is unconscionable, the
Court may refuse to enforce that part of the contract.

During the trial, plaintiffs claimed ** \[\*7\] **that eight elements of
the Warner Agreement\'s "Net Profits" definition were unconscionable:
(1) the 10% advertising overhead charge. . . ; (3) application of the
15% production overhead charge on participation payments to third
parties; (4) application of the 15% production overhead charge on the \$
100,000 deferment. . . ; and (8) the inclusion in "gross receipts" of
only 20% of the revenue from videocassettes, less a distribution fee. .
. .

In considering Warner Bros.\' motion for judgment under [*[Code of Civil
Procedure section
631.8]{.underline}*](https://plus.lexis.com/api/document?collection=statutes-legislation&id=urn:contentItem:5J6R-DJB1-66B9-8163-00000-00&context=1530671),
the Court had little difficulty in rejecting seven of plaintiffs\'
claims.

As to all of the items relating to overhead charges (Items One, Three,
Four, and Seven), the Court granted ** \[\*8\] **Warner Bros.\' motion
for judgment because the plaintiffs failed to prove that historically
Warner Bros.\' indirect general administrative expenses for motion
picture production and advertising \-- "overhead" \-- do not equal or
exceed the amount charged under the "Net Profits" definition, namely, 15
percent of production costs and 10 percent of advertising expenditures.
As a matter of fact, plaintiffs conceded that they could not show that
the overhead charges under the "Net Profits" definition exceeded Warner
Bros.\' actual overhead costs, taken as a whole.

Plaintiffs argued that charging overhead on certain production costs,
advertising expenses, gross participations, deferred payments, and
payments paid to foreign studios was unconscionable because the
administrative cost of providing those goods or services was less than
the contractual 10 or 15 percent overhead surcharge. Plaintiffs did not
prove that allegation. And, more important, the test is not whether
Warner Bros.\' overhead charge on a particular direct cost item exceeded
the "actual" administrative or other indirect expenses associated with
providing that one item or service to the production or advertising of a
movie. As the ** \[\*9\] **accounting experts for both sides testified,
overhead cannot be assessed with such precision. Under the
circumstances, the test must be whether the production and advertising
overheads charged by using the percentage allocations are, in total,
unconscionably higher than Warner Bros.\' actual production and
advertising overhead costs on a motion picture. Plaintiffs offered no
evidence to support such a finding.

Plaintiffs also failed to show that the advertising costs, gross
participations, deferred payments, and payments paid to foreign studios
were not historically included in the pool of costs that were compared
to Warner Bros.\' general and administrative expenses to estimate its
rate of overhead. In sum, plaintiffs simply failed to prove that any of
the overhead charges are unconscionable. . . .

The Court granted the motion for judgment as to Item Eight,
videocassette distribution, on the ground that Mr. Melniker knew that a
20 percent royalty was standard ** \[\*11\] **in the industry. He never
questioned it. He never asked that it be changed. The plaintiffs did not
prove that the 20 percent royalty unconscionably exceeded the actual
revenues, less expenses, from videocassette distribution. They also
offered no evidence that a "distribution fee" on the distribution of
videocassettes was unconscionable. Nor did they prove that they could
have negotiated a better deal elsewhere at the time this deal was made,
in which a higher percentage of video revenue, without deduction of a
distribution fee, would be credited to the picture in calculating "Net
Profits." . . . .

Given the Court\'s decision in favor of Warner ** \[\*15\] **Bros. on
plaintiffs\' unconscionability claim, Warner Bros. is entitled to
prevail on plaintiffs\' Thirteenth Cause of Action for "unfair
competition" because that claim was dependent on a finding that their
"Net Profits" contract was unconscionable. . . .
