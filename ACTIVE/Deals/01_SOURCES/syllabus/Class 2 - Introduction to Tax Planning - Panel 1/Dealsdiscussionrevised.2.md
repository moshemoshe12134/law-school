**Discussion Questions \# 2 (Panel 1)**

**Introduction to Tax Planning**

1.  Our last class ended with a discussion of executive compensation.
    Let's continue with that topic, but we now turn to the other theme
    of this class: regulatory arbitrage. Economically similar
    arrangements are sometimes treated differently. This can happen
    because regulatory regimes are poorly drafted, not perfectly
    conceptualized, or require compromises to be administrable. This
    class uses U.S. tax law as a recurring case study of this more
    general point.

> As an illustrative example, assume that Emma Employee works for
> Barbara Boss. Assume also that the tax rate for each of them is 50% in
> order to keep the numbers round. (The top federal rate for individuals
> in the U.S. actually is 37%.)

a.  When Barbara pays Emma a salary of \$100,000, does Emma pay tax on
    it?

b.  Someone who receives a gift is not taxed under U.S. law, so Emma
    makes the following suggestion to Barbara. "From now on, instead of
    paying me \$100,000 in salary, why don't you pay me \$80,000? And on
    my birthday, you can give me a \$20,000 gift." Would this reduce her
    tax bill? (There is a special rules under U.S. law treating gifts
    from employees as taxable, but please ignore this rule in answering
    this question.)

c.  Do you agree with the following statement? "When economically
    similar arrangements are treated differently, a change in the way
    the transaction is structured can yield dramatically better (or
    worse) treatment."

2.  Let's now view this situation from Barbara's perspective, since Emma
    is not the only one who might be affected by her idea.

    a.  Assume that Barbara brings in \$300,000 in revenue for the work
        that she and Emma do together. Does Barbara pay tax on the
        entire \$300,000? What does the term "deduction" mean? Can an
        employer deduct salary payments?

    b.  Can Barbara deduct the \$10,000 gift? (By analogy, do you expect
        to be able to deduct the cost of a wedding present that you give
        your friend? Or a birthday present you give your mother?)

    c.  How, if at all, would Barbara be affected if she agrees to
        Emma's request to receive an \$80,000 salary and a \$20,000
        gift, instead of a \$100,000 salary? Would Barbara change her
        own tax bill?

    d.  Do you agree with the following statement? "In deciding whether
        a tax strategy should be implemented, tax planners cannot focus
        on only one party to the transaction. Instead, they need to
        think about the tax implications for *all* parties."

    e.  Assume that Barbara lives in another country, which allows
        employers to deduct the cost of gifts to employees. Would this
        affect Barbara's willingness to accept Emma's proposal to earn
        only \$80,000 in salary and to receive a \$20,000 gift?

    f.  The same facts as in "e." What if Barbara suggested \$80,000 of
        salary and a \$15,000 gift? Would Emma prefer that to \$100,000
        of salary? Why would Barbara prefer this?

    g.  Do you agree with the following statement? "When parties to a
        transaction can restructure it to generate more favorable tax
        treatment for one of the parties, they are likely to share the
        tax benefit. So even if only one of the parties can claim the
        benefit, they are likely to adjust the pre-tax cash flows to
        share this benefit with others, whose cooperation is needed to
        generate the tax benefit."

3.  **Exclusion / Valuation:** The planning discussed in questions 1 & 2
    takes advantage of exclusions. Taxpayers strive to improve their
    economic situation in ways that are not included in "gross income"
    for tax purposes (e.g., a gift). Planners also take advantage of
    opportunities to understate the value of what a taxpayer has
    received, effectively excluding a portion of this value.

    a.  Continuing with the saga of Emma, assume she works for ABC Co
        and her salary is \$100k. Emma needs a car, and a new one costs
        \$40k. If Emma asks ABC Co to cut her salary to \$60k, and to
        buy her with a \$40k new car, do you think her tax treatment
        changes? In other words, if someone is paid with goods or
        services, instead of cash, are they taxed on the value of the
        goods and services?

    b.  Emma reads an article, which says that new cars lose 20% of
        their value as soon as they are driven off the lot (because they
        become used cars, so their quality becomes more suspect). So
        Emma changes the request in "a.": "Please pay me \$60k in cash
        and a car. But instead of letting me pick it up from the dealer,
        ABC should buy it, keep it for a week (without using it), and
        then give it to me." What is Emma's goal in making this
        suggestion?

    c.  Let's consider the effect on ABC. If the car is worth \$30k when
        they transfer it to Emma, how much is their compensation
        deduction?

    d.  Is there an additional deduction that ABC might claim here?
        (Hint: Did they lose money on the car?)

4.  **Conversion:** Another type of tax planning strives to convert
    income that the tax system classifies unfavorably to income that is
    classified more favorably.

    a.  In the U.S., there are two types of income. One is "ordinary
        income," which includes salary income. The maximum rate is 37%
        under current law. The other is "capital gain," which generally
        is a taxpayer's profit from an investment. (This is
        oversimplified, but it is approximately right). The maximum rate
        for capital gain is 23.8%. Which income would a taxpayer usually
        rather receive?

    b.  Emma (from the questions above) thinks the stock of ABC Co. is
        going to appreciate in value. She spends \$10k of her \$100k
        salary to buy stock (100 shares at \$100 per share). The stock
        appreciates to \$15k, so she sells it for a \$5k profit. Is her
        profit taxed as capital gain or ordinary income?

    c.  Instead of receiving cash and using it to buy stock, Emma asks
        ABC to reduce her cash salary by \$10k (to \$90k) and to give
        her 100 shares of ABC (worth \$10k). ABC agrees, but with a
        condition: Emma keeps this stock only if she continues to work
        for the company for 12 months. After 12 months, the stock is
        worth \$15k. How is the stock taxed? (Hint: When employees
        receive stock or other property subject to "vesting"---that is,
        they don't keep it unless they satisfy the condition, which
        often is about staying in their jobs---they don't pay tax until
        the property vests, and then they pay tax based on its value at
        the time it vests.)

    d.  Does the change from "b" to "c" increase or reduce Emma's tax
        bill?

    e.  U.S. tax law offers someone in Emma's position a choice. If she
        receives property subject to a vesting requirement, she can make
        a so-called "83(b) election," which allows her to pay tax on the
        value of the property when she receives it---not when it vests.
        Any gain (or loss) after that is treated as capital gain (or
        loss). If Emma expects the stock to increase in value (e.g.,
        from \$100 to \$150 per share), should she make an 83(b)
        election? Is this a conversion strategy?

    f.  An employer deducts the same amount that an employee includes.
        So what is ABC's deduction in "c" (i.e., when Emma does not make
        an 83(b) election)? What about in "e" (when Emma does make this
        election)? Which is better for the employer?

5.  **Deferral:** Another type of tax planning defers a tax. Let's
    consider why is deferral valuable and how it is achieved.

    a.  Assume that your neighbor needs \$10,000 to pay a bill. She is
        expecting a \$10,000 payment to come in one year, but until then
        she is short of money. You, on the other hand, have \$10,000 on
        hand. She asks to borrow the money from you.

        i.  What concerns, if any, might you have in making this loan?

        ii. You might think that you don't need this money now. But is
            it possible that conditions will change? If in two months
            you need the money, could it be a problem for you that you
            have made this loan?

        iii. If you make this loan, will you do it for free?

    b.  In general, why do taxpayers prefer to pay a tax next year,
        instead of this year (assuming the relevant tax rate does not
        change)?

    c.  You anticipate having to pay a \$10,000 bill in one year. For
        simplicity's sake, assume that your marginal tax rate is 50% and
        (quite unrealistically) that interest rates are 10%.

        i.  You decide to invest money today in order to fund this
            \$10,000 obligation in one year Do you need to invest
            \$10,000 today? More? Less?

        ii. If you invest \$9,524, what will your pretax return be after
            one year (assuming you earn 10%)? What will you have left
            after paying a 50% tax on this interest income?

        iii. What is the present value of \$10,000 in one year, assuming
             a discount rate of 5%?

        iv. What if the obligation to pay is in two years, instead of in
            one year? Do you still have to set aside \$9,524? If not,
            would you have to set aside more or less?

        v.  How much will you have in two years if you set aside \$9070
            today?

    d.  Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:
        "Deferring a tax reduces its present value."

    e.  Is tax deferral more or less powerful as the deferral period
        grows? In other words, from the taxpayer's perspective, is
        deferring a tax for two years better or worse than deferring it
        for one year (assuming the nominal amount of the tax does not
        change)?

    f.  The same problem as above, but interest rates are 2%, instead of
        10%. After paying the 50% tax on your interest income, how much
        will you have in one year if you set aside \$9,901 today?

    g.  What is the present value of \$10,000 in one year, assuming a
        discount rate of 1%?

    h.  Is tax deferral more or less powerful as interest rates rise?

    i.  Fran is an independent contractor, who is doing some freelance
        editing for George. As a "cash method" taxpayer, Fran owes tax
        on income only after she receives it. Fran has worked quite a
        number of hours, and is going to receive a significant payment.
        In late November, Fran mentions to you that she is about to send
        an invoice for this payment. What tax advice can you offer about
        the timing of when she should send this invoice?

6.  **Shifting:** Another type of tax planning shifts income from one
    taxpayer to another.

    a.  Diane is an investment banker, whose marginal income is taxed in
        the 37% bracket. Diane's son, Eric, is a high school teacher,
        whose marginal income is taxed in the 22% bracket. Diane owns a
        portfolio of bonds, which pays \$10,000 of interest each year.
        She wants to use this money to help Eric. What is her after-tax
        income from these bonds?

    b.  Instead of giving Eric her after-tax interest on the bonds, she
        considers giving him the bonds. When he receives the \$10,000
        interest payment, how much tax would Eric pay? How much would he
        have after paying this tax?

    c.  Either way, Diane is dedicating the return from this bond
        portfolio to Eric. Which of these alternatives reduces their
        combined tax liability and gets Eric the most money?

    d.  Are there reasons (having nothing to do with tax) why Diane
        might hesitate to adopt this tax planning strategy?

7.  **Shifting: Multinationals**. Parent, a U.S. company, sells phones
    to U.S. consumers, charging \$500 per phone. The phones cost \$100
    to manufacture and another \$100 in marketing and distribution
    costs, netting a \$300 profit.

    a.  Absent any tax planning, the \$300 will be taxed currently in
        the U.S. How much tax must Parent pay, assuming the U.S.
        corporate tax rate is 21%.

    b.  Parent incorporates a wholly owned subsidiary in Ireland, called
        IrishSub. The corporate tax in Ireland is 12.5%. (It may
        increase to 15% under a recent agreement, but the timing and
        details of this change are unclear.). Is Parent better off
        shifting income to IrishSub?

    c.  Parent borrows funds from IrishSub and pays \$100 of tax
        deductible interest per phone to IrishSub. How much taxable
        income does Parent now have in the U.S.? How much does it have
        in Ireland? By how much has Parent reduced its overall tax bill?
        (Assume that the U.S. does not tax IrishSub's income, and that
        this tax would be triggered only if IrishSub pays a dividend to
        Parent. This used to be the rule in the U.S.)

    d.  When Parent developed the current version of its phones, it
        included a number of technological innovations, which are
        patented. Although the engineers developing these innovations
        work in California, they work for IrishSub, which is responsible
        for coordinating Parent's research. Assume Parent starts paying
        a \$150 royalty to IrishSub for each phone it sells in the U.S.
        (Assume that Parent is also paying the interest described in
        part "c.") How much taxable income does Parent have in the U.S.?
        How much taxable income does IrishSub have in Ireland? Through
        these strategies, how much is the multinational reducing its
        total tax bill (includinb both Irish & U.S. taxes)?

    e.  How do changes in the U.S. corporate tax rate affect a
        multinational's incentive to engage in this shifting? For
        example, the U.S. corporate rate used to be 35%, and Congress
        reduced it to 21% in 2017. Do you think that change reduced or
        increased the incentive of multinationals to shift income?

8.  **Frictions:** In analyzing whether tax planning is effective, we
    have to consider non-tax costs associated with the planning
    strategy, which economists call "frictions." If those costs exceed
    the tax savings, a taxpayer will not pursue the strategy.

<!-- -->

a.  Recall the example of Fran, the independent contractor. What nontax
    costs might persuade her not to take your tax advice?

b.  Recall the example of Diane, who is deciding whether to give the
    bond portfolio to her son, Eric. What is the most tax efficient step
    for her to take? Again, why might she not take this step (for nontax
    reasons)?

c.  Recall the multinational that manufactures phones. Under current
    law, Parent's engineers live in California, but Parent can shift the
    value from their work to Ireland, where it is taxed at a lower rate.
    What if Congress changed the law, requiring the engineers to work in
    Ireland in order for profits from their work to be taxed there?
    Would that matter?

d.  Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? "The goal of
    tax planning is not to minimize taxes, but to maximize after-tax
    returns."

<!-- -->

9.  **All Parties:** As review, remember that when analyzing whether tax
    planning is effective, we have to consider all parties to the
    transaction.

    a.  Recall the example of Fran, the independent contractor. For tax
        reasons, she cares when she receives the payment. What about
        George, who is the one *making* this payment. Assume that he is
        also a cash method taxpayer, and that the payment is a business
        expense that he can deduct. Does he have a preference about
        timing? Is it the same as Fran's preference?

    b.  If Fran and George are in the same tax bracket, what tax
        advantage, if any, is there for them to adjust the timing of the
        payment?

    c.  What if Fran is doing this work for a nonprofit (e.g., a
        university)? Does that change the analysis?

    d.  Have you heard the phrase "tax accommodation party" or "tax
        indifferent party"? Can you think of an example of one?
