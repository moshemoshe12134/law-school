Deals

Professor David Schizer

**Class 22: Incentive Design (Panel 3)**

1.  Parties enter in transactions seeking value from each other. An
    important challenge arises when the parties have trouble determining
    whether their counterparty actually is doing what it promised to do.

    a.  What term do economists use to describe performance that is hard
        to observe?

    b.  Even when performance is hard to observe, why might parties
        perform anyway? (Hint: the answer is not rooted in contract.)

    c.  How is moral hazard different from adverse selection?

    d.  Adam is CEO of XYZ, a public company. CEO comp tends to rise
        with the size of the company. Adam has the opportunity for XYZ
        to acquire ABC. What is the potential for moral hazard here?

2.  Betty is founder and CEO of a biotech startup, which is seeking to
    cure Disease. She approaches Big Pharma for financing. Big Pharma
    ("BP") provides \$50 million. In return, if Betty develops a cure,
    Big Pharma will get a mandatory licence to commercialize the drug
    and will receive 15% the the revenue from selling the cure.

    a.  Why didn't BP simply buy the idea from Betty? What problems make
        this structure more appealing?

    b.  Why didn't BP offer a fixed price to Betty's startup, instead of
        sharing royalties?

    c.  Assume the annual revenue is \$10 million. Assume also that BP
        has limited cash. Instead of investing in the development of
        Betty's cure, BP could put money into a different drug, DD,
        which treats a different disease. BP developed DD itself, and
        expects it to generate \$9.5 million of annual revenue. Which is
        BP likely to favor?

    d.  To address this issue, is it better to have a larger up-front
        payment or a larger royalty?

    e.  Are there other potential responses? (Hint: how can the
        visibility of BP's actions be increased?)

3.  Christine is CEO of Debtor Co, and she owns all of its equity, which
    is worth \$25 million. Emma has lent Debtor Co \$50 million.
    Christine is considering a deal with a 40% chance of doubling Debtor
    Co's total capitalized value (including debt and equity) to \$150,
    and a 60% chance of reducing its value to \$0.

    a.  Is the expected value of this deal positive or negative overall?

    b.  For Christine in particular, is the expected value positive or
        negative?

    c.  Generalizing from this example, how can leverage produce moral
        hazard for equity holders?

4.  In insurance contracts, how do insurance companies address moral
    hazard?

5.  In principle, parties should try to introduce financial incentives
    to head off moral hazard. K&S say this is challenging. Why?

6.  Frank is a salesman. He would rather earn a fixed salary, but his
    employer wants to pay him on commission.

    a.  What is the advantage of the commission structure?

    b.  Why is Frank potentially unhappy with it? What might he demand
        in return?

    c.  In principle, might it be worth it for Frank's employer to pay
        him extra as a way to induce him to take more risk?

7.  Georgia is managing partner of a law firm, which traditionally has
    lock-step compensation. She is considering switching to an "eat what
    you kill" system.

    a.  What advantages do you see in this change?

    b.  What advantages do you see in the lock-step system?

8.  Incentivizing multiple tasks

    a.  Why is it so hard to design an incentive system when the goal is
        to motivate people to succeed at multiple tasks on multiple
        dimensions?

    b.  Why is this a problem at a law firm?

    c.  Why was it a problem to give a bonus for home runs? And a
        penalty for interceptions? And a bonus for completed passes?

9.  Elaine Entrepreneur launches a high tech startup. Six months later,
    she persuades Veronica, a venture capitalist, to invest \$20 million
    for 40% of the company, which implies a valuation for the whole
    company of \$50 million. Veronica received convertible preferred
    shares, which give her voting control unless and until there is an
    IPO, in which case Veronica's shares mandatorily convert into
    common.

<!-- -->

a.  Review: there is a potential tax reason why Veronica's shares are
    convertible preferred. What is it?

b.  Assume that Veronica's shares have a "1X" liquidation preference.
    Veronica needs cash for another startup that she thinks is more
    interesting. Acquiror offers \$21 million for the company, which
    obviously is \$29 less than the implied valuation when Veronica
    invested. Does Veronica have an incentive to take this deal? Will
    Elaine think this is a good deal?

c.  In this situation, how much must Acquiror offer in order for
    Veronica to convert to common as part of the deal?

d.  Assume that Veronica's shares have a 2X liquidation preference, and
    Acquiror offers \$41 million. How much does Veronica get? How much
    do Elaine and the other shareholders get?

e.  Even though Veronica has voting control, how might Elaine and her
    team still try to block a sale?

10. SPAC

    a.  What is a SPAC?

    b.  SPACs have a "sponsor." What is their role? What expenses do
        they bear? What benefits do they get?

    c.  What is "dilution"? Who gets diluted in a SPAC?

    d.  Who has a strong incentive to do an acquisition within the
        prescribed time period? Why?

    e.  Are the incentives of managers and shareholders aligned in a
        SPAC?
