**Class 15: Negotiations (Panel 2)**

1.  Alice Advocate is a partner at Big Law, whose expertise is mergers
    and acquisitions. Big Law pays her 100X. Her long-time client, Betty
    Banker, has been Head of M&A at Investment Bank. Betty has just been
    promoted to Head of Investment Banking. She needs to hire someone to
    replace her as Head of M&A, and would like to hire Alice.

> Betty also would consider hiring her deputy, Chris, who has been her
> second-in-command in nearly all of the transactions she has done in
> the past four years. She thinks Chris would be a good fit as well, but
> he may be a bit young for this role.
>
> Alice has sometimes considered leaving her law firm for an investment
> bank. She sees benefits and costs in making this switch. On the
> positive side, she expects to earn more money. On the negative side,
> she likes the craft of lawyering, the ability to be involved in more
> transactions, and the fact that her law firm is probably more
> collegial than an investment bank would be. Given these tradeoffs,
> Alice would leave Big Law for law firm if she is paid \$140X, but she
> won't make this change for less.
>
> Meanwhile, Betty meets with Alice and asks her to consider coming to
> be Head of M&A at investment bank, and this kicks off a negotiation
> between them.

a.  What does "BATNA" stand for? In this negotiation, what is Betty's
    BATNA? What is Alice's BATNA?

b.  What does the phrase "reservation price" mean? What is Alice's
    reservation price as she considers whether to work at Investment
    Bank?

c.  What does the term "ZOPA"?

d.  Assume that Betty is willing to pay up to 160X to hire Alice. Is
    there a ZOPA here?

e.  When there is a ZOPA, does this mean there is definitely going to be
    an agreement? Why or why not?

2.  Continuing with the facts above, Betty knows that Alice is very
    tough in negotiations about money. Indeed, it's one of the qualities
    that makes Alice such a strong candidate. So Betty decides to drive
    a hard bargain, expecting to come up (slowly) in the negotiation, so
    Alice will feel good about the "concessions" she extracts.

> Meanwhile, Alice is conflicted about whether to leave Big Law. The
> managing partner, Diane, has been a good friend and mentor to her.
>
> When Alice asks what compensation Betty has in mind, Betty says, "The
> main reason to come to Investment Bank is not money. It's the
> excitement and professional growth from being a principal in a
> transaction. Alice, you are so good at representing the principal, but
> don't you want to BE the principal? Don't get me wrong. We will pay
> you generously. We are thinking of paying you 120X.

a.  How is Betty hoping Alice will respond? How does she see the
    negotiation evolving?

b.  Assume that Alice is very tough when she negotiates about money for
    her clients, but is not comfortable doing so about herself. If this
    is the case, how might Betty's strategy backfire?

c.  Instead of "b," assume that Alice does not mind a tough negotiation
    on her own behalf, but money isn't the only thing she cares about.
    When Betty offers 120X, she replies, "that's not the number
    expected, but I'll think about it." She ends the conversation
    because she is supposed to have dinner with Diane that evening and
    does not want to be late. Again, how might Betty's strategy not lead
    to a deal?

d.  Instead of "b" and "c," assume that Alice decides to play tough,
    knowing that Betty values this quality in her. She decides to
    exaggerate her demands, expecting to meet in the middle. "I'd love
    to work more closely with you," Alice says, "but not for 120X. To be
    honest, I don't think I would get out of bed in the morning for that
    amount. I would need at least 200X to take this job." Betty is a bit
    shocked by this number, which is significantly more than will be
    paid as Head of Investment Banking. How might Alice's plan backfire?

e.  Klausner & Subramanian (K&S) say that even when there is a ZOPA,
    "attempts at strategic bargaining can result in no deal." What do
    they mean?

f.  Continuing with "d," assume now that Betty smiles at Alice's
    negotiating style. "I wish I could pay you 200X. To be honest, I
    think you would be worth it," Betty responds. "But that's a great
    deal more than I earned in this role, and I'm sure you would agree
    that I was pretty good at it. My starting salary was 120X--that's
    why I offered that amount to you--but it's been a few years since
    then, so let's make it \_\_\_." What do you think Betty should offer
    here? As noted above, Alice would take 140X. Do you think Betty
    needs to offer that much at this point? What if she offers 125X?

g.  Assuming the negotiation continues, what counter-offer do you think
    Alice should make? How much should she come down from 200X at this
    point? What are the competing considerations?

3.  Bidder, a widget manufacturer, is considering buying Target, another
    widget manufacturer. Target's board has determined that they would
    sell for as low as \$900X, while Bidder's board has decided that it
    is willing to pay up to \$1000X.

    a.  What is the ZOPA?

    b.  There is \$100X of value which can be gained in this
        transaction. How will the parties determine how it is divided?
        According to K&S, what role does bargaining power play?

    c.  K&S mention different ways to improve bargaining power. The
        first is "improve your BATNA." How could Bidder use this
        strategy? How could Target use it?

    d.  The second is "tie your hands." Give an example of how bidder
        could use this strategy?

    e.  How could Target tie its hands?

    f.  K&S mentions a third strategy: "learn about the other side's
        BATNA." How could each side do this in the above transaction?

    g.  Sellers sometimes try to trigger an auction. Which of the three
        bargaining power strategies is this?

    h.  As we discussed in an earlier class, sellers that are public
        companies must get the approval of their shareholders to sell
        the company. Which of the three bargaining power strategies is
        this?

    i.  How would the parties negotiate this deal using "Full Open and
        Truthful Exchange" or "FOTE" model?

    j.  How would they negotiate it with the "Poker School" approach?

    k.  If Target uses the FOTE approach and Bidder uses the Poker
        School approach, how will this negotiation play out?

    l.  Same as "k," but Target catches Bidder in an exaggeration. What
        will happen?

4.  Dean Dana is speaking with Professor Paul about whether he will
    accept an offer to join Dean Dana's faculty. They need to agree on
    six issues: Paul's salary, which courses he will teach; whether he
    will have a named professorship; which office he will have; what
    administrative responsibilities he will take on; and how much
    secretarial support he will receive.

    a.  Paul wants to work his way down the list, deciding one at a
        time. Dana wants to hear his views on each issue before deciding
        any of them. Which approach is better and why?

    b.  Assume that Dana has a large corner office available (because
        it's occupant just retired). She really needs someone to teach
        the courses Paul usually teaches. She does not have a named
        professorship at the moment, but expects to have one in three
        years. Assume also that Paul has no need for secretarial
        assistance, hates administrative work, and wants to maximize his
        salary.

        i.  Assuming that all that matters is the preferences and needs
            of Dana and Paul, what would their deal look like?

        ii. Now let's add another variable: Dana worries about setting
            precedents, so that other professors would ask for what Paul
            got. How does this complicate the negotiation?

        iii. In iii, is the negotiation easier or harder if other
             faculty might be able to observe some, but not all, of what
             Paul received?

        iv. How (if at all) can Dana turn her precedent problem into a
            negotiation advantage? (Hint: consider the three bargaining
            power principles discussed above.)

        v.  Assume that Paul has the non-salary terms he wants at his
            current employer. How can he use this as a negotiating
            advantage? (Hint: consider the three bargaining power
            principles discussed above.)

        vi. If Paul tells Dana that he has the non-salary terms he wants
            at his current school, is there a reason why Dana might not
            find this persuasive? (Hint: remember the Poker School.) Is
            it easy or hard for her to tell him why she is not
            persuaded? How necessary (if it all) is it for her to tell
            him?
