# Deals Course Prep Sheet Style Guide

**Purpose:** This guide defines the standards for creating high-quality class prep sheets that will help you prepare for class discussions.

---

## Document Structure

Every prep sheet should follow this structure:

### 1. Header Section
```markdown
# Class [N] Prep Sheet: [Topic Title]

**Course:** Deals
**Topic:** [Topic Name]
**Date:** [Semester/Year]

---
```

### 2. Key Concepts Overview
Start with a brief overview of the main concepts covered in the class materials. This should include:
- Core definitions
- Main frameworks or models
- Key themes that connect the questions

### 3. Question-by-Question Analysis
Go through each discussion question systematically with detailed answers.

### 4. Key Takeaways Section
End with a summary of the most important lessons from the class.

### 5. Notes for Class Discussion
Practical tips for participating in class discussion.

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone and Voice
- **Voice:** Write as if you're explaining to a smart classmate - conversational but professional
- **Tone:** Analytical, thoughtful, engaged with the material
- **Audience:** Law student at 12th grade reading level (clear, not overly academic)
- **Perspective:** First-person plural ("we") when appropriate, or direct second-person ("you")

### Vocabulary Level
- **Target:** 12th grade / high school graduate level
- **Avoid:** Overly academic jargon without explanation
- **Define:** Key terms when first introduced (even if obvious)
- **Explain:** Complex concepts in simple language
- **Use:** Legal and economic terminology, but always explain context

### Answer Style

#### For YES/NO Questions:
1. **Start with a clear YES or NO** (bolded)
2. **Provide immediate reasoning** (1-2 sentences)
3. **Elaborate with bullet points** for additional nuance

Example:
```markdown
**Would you be more comfortable? YES.**

The contingent payment structure makes buyers more comfortable because:
- Shifts risk from buyer to seller
- Gives seller incentive to be honest
- Reduces buyer's exposure to hidden defects
```

#### For Definition Questions:
1. **Bold the term being defined**
2. **Provide a clear, concise definition**
3. **Give a concrete example or application**
4. **Explain why it matters**

Example:
```markdown
### B. Asymmetric Information - Definition

**Asymmetric information** occurs when one party to a transaction has more or better information than the other party.

**Application to used cars:**
- Seller knows: hidden mechanical problems, accident history
- Buyer only sees: surface appearance, seller's statements
- This creates the classic "lemons problem" (Akerlof)
```

#### For Analytical/Calculation Questions:
1. **Show your work** (calculations, reasoning steps)
2. **Use bullet points** for clarity
3. **Highlight the answer** at the end (bolded)
4. **Explain the implications**

Example:
```markdown
**Expected value calculation:**
- 50% × $500 + 50% × $0 = $250

**The stock would be worth $250 to risk-neutral investors.**

**Comparison to current value:**
- Current: $100
- With Venture: $250
- **Increase of $150 per share**
```

## Formatting Rules

### Headers
- Use `#` for main title
- Use `##` for question numbers
- Use `###` for sub-questions (A, B, C, etc.)

### Emphasis
- **Bold** key terms, definitions, YES/NO answers, and final answers
- Use *italics* for subtle emphasis only
- **DO NOT use ALL CAPS** for emphasis (except for acronyms)

### Bullet Points
- Use bullet points for lists of 3+ items
- Use numbered lists for sequences or priorities
- Keep bullet points concise (1-2 lines each)
- Use parallel structure in bullet points

### Tables
Use tables for:
- Comparing multiple options
- Showing tool/problem pairs
- Side-by-side analysis

Example:
```markdown
| Tool | Problem it Solves | Example |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| Due Diligence | Information asymmetry | Financial review |
```

### Blockquotes
Use blockquotes sparingly, for:
- Key insights worth highlighting
- Important principles
- Quote-worthy statements

Example:
```markdown
> Every transaction involves problems of information and incentives that can discourage parties from entering into value-maximizing arrangements.
```

## Content Requirements

### Must Include for Each Question:

1. **Direct Answer:** Clear response to what's being asked
2. **Reasoning:** Economic or legal logic behind the answer
3. **Examples:** Concrete illustrations of the concept
4. **Connections:** Links to other questions/concepts when relevant
5. **Nuance:** Acknowledgment of complexity or trade-offs

### Special Sections:

#### For "Define the Term" Questions:
- Formal definition
- Real-world example
- Why the concept matters
- How it applies to the scenario

#### For Scenario-Based Questions:
- Facts of the scenario
- Key issue or problem
- Analysis from multiple perspectives
- Practical implications

#### For Calculation Questions:
- Step-by-step math
- Final answer (bolded)
- What the answer means
- Why it matters

## Key Concepts to Emphasize

Throughout your prep sheets, consistently reinforce these themes:

### The Three Core Problems:
1. **Information Asymmetry** - One party knows more than the other
2. **Agency Costs** - Decision-makers' interests conflict with stakeholders
3. **Uncertainty** - No one knows what will happen

### The Lawyer's Role:
Transactional lawyers design mechanisms to overcome these problems:
- Due diligence (reduces information asymmetry)
- Contingent purchase price (allocates risk)
- Staged financing (aligns incentives)
- Representations & warranties (creates legal accountability)
- Third-party vouching (provides credible guarantees)

### Economic Reasoning Patterns:
- **Incentives matter:** People respond to how they're rewarded/punished
- **Risk allocation:** Assign risk to whoever can best bear it
- **Information is costly:** Due diligence and verification have costs
- **Contracts as mechanisms:** Deal structures solve information and incentive problems
- **Trade-offs exist:** Every solution creates new potential problems

---

## Research and Enhancement

### When to Use External Research:
- To explain complex legal concepts
- To provide real-world examples
- To clarify economic theories
- To add context that enhances understanding

### Research Sources:
- Legal dictionaries for definitions
- Law and economics scholarship
- Real-world case examples
- Business news for practical applications

### Citation Style:
- No formal citations needed
- Mention key concepts or cases in passing (e.g., "Akerlof's lemons problem")
- Focus on understanding over attribution

---

## Common Patterns to Address

### The "Due Diligence vs. Insurance" Insight:
When discussing protections or guarantees, distinguish between:
- **Addressing information asymmetry** (allowing buyer to inspect/verify)
- **Providing insurance** (protecting against buyer's own actions)

**Key framing:** Solutions that go beyond the information asymmetry problem (by effectively providing insurance) create moral hazard problems.

### The "Who Best Bears Risk" Analysis:
When allocating risk, consider:
1. **Risk tolerance:** Who can best absorb losses?
2. **Control:** Who can influence the outcome?
3. **Information:** Who knows the risk best?
4. **Insurance:** Who can most cheaply insure against the risk?
5. **Diversification:** Who can spread this risk across many events?
6. **Predictive ability:** Who can use historical data/law of large numbers?

### The "Agency Cost" Framework:
When discussing conflicts of interest:
1. **Identify the principal and agent**
2. **Explain where interests diverge**
3. **Show how the agent can benefit at the principal's expense**
4. **Propose mechanisms to align incentives** (equity comp, oversight, etc.)

## Review Process

After creating a prep sheet:
1. **Read it through** as if you're a student seeing the material for the first time
2. **Check clarity** - Are the answers unambiguous?
3. **Verify completeness** - Did you answer every part of every question?
4. **Test understanding** - Would this prepare someone for class discussion?
5. **Refine formatting** - Is it visually easy to navigate?
