**Introduction to Information & Incentive Problems**

**P***lease bring these questions to class because we will discuss them
in class.*

In an article you will read for next time, Ron Gilson & Teo Baums
introduce three concepts: information asymmetry; agency costs; and
uncertainty. The following is a brief excerpt:

*All contracts respond to three central problems: uncertainty,
information asymmetry, and agency costs. The special character of
venture capital contracting is shaped by the fact that investing in
early stage, high technology companies presents these three problems in
extreme form.*

*Precisely because the portfolio company is at an early stage,
uncertainty concerning future performance is magnified. Virtually all of
the important decisions bearing on the company's success remain to be
made, and most of the significant uncertainties concerning the outcome
of the company's efforts remain unresolved. To the extent the
entrepreneur is beginning her first company, additional uncertainty
concerns the quality of the company's management. . . Finally, the
technology base of the portfolio company's business exacerbates the
general uncertainty by adding scientific uncertainty. . . .*

*The same factors expand the information asymmetries between potential
investors and entrepreneurs, as intentions and abilities are far less
observable \[by investors\] than actions already taken \[by
management\]. Similarly, the fact that the portfolio company's
technology involves cutting edge science assures that the information
asymmetry between the entrepreneur, typically directly involved in the
company's research effort, and the venture capital fund, even if the
fund employs individuals with advanced scientific training, will be
unusually wide.*

*Finally, the importance of future managerial decisions in an early
stage company whose value depends almost entirely on future growth
options, creates potentially very large agency costs . . . . \[T\]he
entrepreneur's interests will sharply diverge from those of the venture
capital investors, especially with respect to the risk level and
duration of the investment.*

1\. I offer to sell you a used car for \$5,000. You need a car and the
price is within your budget.

A.  Is there anything else you need to know or think about before you
    agree to purchase the car?

B.  Please define the term "asymmetric information." How does it apply
    to the purchase of a used car?

C.  In principle, could the problem of asymmetric information persuade a
    potential buyer not to buy a used car? Could this be true even if
    the used car is as good as the seller says it is?

D.  As a buyer, would you be more comfortable if you can ask me
    questions? What if I am not honest in my answers? How can you
    improve the odds that I will answer honestly (or, at least, prove
    later that my answers were false)?

E.  Would you be more comfortable if we bring in a mechanic to look at
    the car?

F.  In part "E," what if the mechanic is my brother-in-law? Please
    define the term "agency cost."

G.  Would you be more comfortable if I offer to let you pay only \$2,000
    now, and to pay \$3,000 in a year if the car is still running well?

H.  In Part "G," does it matter how we define whether the car is
    "running well"?

I.  If we agree to the idea in "G," would it affect how carefully you
    take care of the car? Please define the term "moral hazard."

J.  Instead of a car, assume I offer to sell you a house for \$500,000.
    You need a house and the price, again, is within your budget. Is
    there asymmetric information in this situation? As you consider
    whether to buy the house, could variations of the steps discussed
    above for buying a car be helpful?

K.  What if you want to buy a business? Is there asymmetric information
    in this situation? Are variations of the steps discussed above
    potentially helpful?

L.  Do you agree with the following statement? "Because the seller
    always knows more than the buyer, I should never buy anything ever
    again?"

M.  Do you agree with the following statement? "Although transactions
    vary in their details, every transaction involves problems of
    information and incentives that can discourage parties from entering
    into what otherwise would be value-maximizing arrangements."

N.  Do you agree with the following statement? "A central responsibility
    of transactional lawyers is to help overcome information and
    incentive problems. They do so with a range of contractual and
    organizational responses, such as due diligence, contingent purchase
    price, staged financing, and vouching by third parties."

2\. Stores that sell clothes online often allow people to return them at
no charge. But it costs them time and money to let people return them.

A.  Why give people a "money-back guarantee" of this sort?

B.  If you sell clothes online, and someone who buys them spills wine on
    them, would you accept the clothes back?

C.  You are the CEO of an online retail store. You decide to offer a new
    option to buyers: if they pay an extra amount, they can return
    clothes in the first year for any reason, including the fact that
    they stained them. You learn that under the old system---no returns
    for stains---one in ten items of clothing are stained during the
    first year. As a result, if you charge an extra 10%, would that be
    enough to fund the return policy? (Hint: If you sell people the
    right to return clothes they have stained, do you think it will
    affect how careful they are with the clothes?)

3\. You want to go into business organizing outdoor concerts. A
challenge, though, is that it sometimes rains, so the concert has to be
cancelled.

A.  Do you consider this to be an issue of asymmetric information or an
    issue of uncertainty? What is the difference?

B.  If a concert is cancelled because of rain, who should bear this
    risk---the performer, the ticket holders, or the owner of the arena?

C.  How should we decide who is in the best position to bear the risk of
    bad weather? How does this risk compare with the risks involved in
    allowing clothing returns?

4\. You are considering buying stock in either Autoco or Carco. They
make similar products (automobiles) and are otherwise similar, except
for this difference: The executives in Autoco all own stock in Autoco,
but the executives in Carco do not own stock in Carco. Why might this
difference be significant?

5\. You are the chief executive officer ("CEO") of Bigco, a
publicly-traded firm. You are thinking about buying a corporate jet. The
business of the company does not require it, but you think "I'm the
boss, I deserve it." The jet costs the company \$10 million, and you
will derive pleasure worth 1% of that, or \$100,000.

A.  Will shareholders want you to buy the jet? If not, how much
    influence to public shareholders have over this sort of issue? Who
    else might be in a position to stop you?

B.  If you are not a shareholder, is it beneficial to you personally to
    buy the jet? What is this type of incentive problem called? (See the
    excerpt from Gilson & Baums above.)

C.  If you own 2% of the company's outstanding stock, is it beneficial
    to you personally to buy the jet?

D.  Can equity compensation be a response to agency costs?

6\. You are the chief executive officer of Bigco, whose stock price
currently is \$100 per share. You have worked there your entire career,
and you are well respected in the business world for your successes. As
a result, you constantly receive other offers to work elsewhere \--
something you appreciate \-- but you have turned them down.

> A. One of your senior managers brings you the following proposal. If
> you invest all of Bigco's assets in a new technology (the "Venture"),
> it could pay off very well. Specifically, there is a 50% chance that
> the company's stock price will be worth \$500. On the other hand, if
> Venture does not succeed, the company will become bankrupt (so the
> stock will be worth \$0). If you proceed with Venture, what would your
> stock price be worth to risk neutral investors? How does that compare
> with the stock's current value of \$100?
>
> B. If the company enters bankruptcy, what would your shareholders

> represents less than 5% of their holdings? Do you think these

>
> D. Assume that CEO has been receiving \$3 million in cash each year,
> but the compensation package is changed to \$2.5 million in cash and
> 10,000 shares of Bigco stock (currently worth \$1 million if Bigco).
> If Bigco proceeds with Venture, how much would the stock be worth if
> the investment succeeds? What if it fails? Under the new compensation
> package, will the risky investment seem more or less attractive to the
> CEO?

7\. Assume that the stock of Company is currently trading at \$45.
Assume also that the S&P 500 Stock Index is trading at \$6,000 (to pick
a round number). Assume that Company grants Executive 100,000 options to
buy Company stock at \$60 any time during the next ten years.

A.  Assume that ten years later, Company's stock price has increased by
    just over 10% to \$66. How much does Executive earn from these
    options?

B.  Assume also that ten years later, the S&P 500 has increased by 50%
    to \$9,000. How happy do you think shareholders are with Company's
    performance?

C.  Assume that ten years later, Company's stock price is still \$60.
    How much does Executive earn from these options?

D.  Assume that ten years later, the S&P 500 has declined by 50%, and is
    \$3,000. How happy do you think shareholders are with Company's
    performance?

E.  Do you think the options given to Executive are structured in the
    right way to create the incentives shareholders want Executive to
    have? Are there any problems you would like to fix?

8\. Like in the question above, assume that the stock of Company is
currently trading at \$60. Assume also that the S&P 500 Stock Index is
trading at \$6,000. But instead of granting Executive 100,000 options to
buy Company stock for \$60 (a "conventional option"), Company offers an
"Indexed Option" instead. Under this "Indexed Option," Executive has the
right to buy Company stock at any time during the next 10 years \-- not
for the fixed price of \$60\--but for 1/100 of the value of the S&P 500
Stock Index on the date of the purchase.

A.  Assume that ten years later, Company's stock price has increased by
    10% to \$66 and the S&P 500 has increased by 50% to \$9,000. How
    much money (if any) would Executive make in exercising his 100,000
    options? Does this result seem appropriate?

B.  Assume that ten years later, Company's stock price is still \$60 and
    the S&P 500 has declined by 50% to \$3,000. How much money (if any)
    would Executive make in exercising his 100,000 options? Does this
    result seem appropriate?

C.  If you served on a board of directors and were named the chair of
    the compensation committee, would you favor granting conventional
    options or indexed options?
