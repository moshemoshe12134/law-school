**Vertical Integration as a Response to Information & Incentive Problems
(Panel 2)**

1.  Demand for Specific Movies

    a.  Sometimes a market practice exists not because (or, at least,
        not solely because) it gives the relevant firms market power;
        sometimes the practice also is efficient. To explore whether
        this is the case with vertical integration, we need to dig into
        the economics of the industry. According to Arthur De Vany, what
        factors drive the demand for movies? What role does the
        dissemination of information play?

    b.  According to De Vany, what is the key moment that determines the
        success of a movie? Is it the opening? Or another moment?

    c.  According to Arthur De Vany, do the revenues from movies plot
        onto a standard "bell curve"? Why or why not?

    d.  Does Devany think that when a movie is being made, its chances
        of success are a matter of uncertainty? Or asymmetric
        information? What is the difference?

    e.  How effective does De Vany think movie producers are in
        predicting the success of movies? Do you think De Vany's view is
        universally shared?

    f.  Is it controversial to say that predictions about a movie's
        popularity *before* it is released can never be as accurate as
        evidence gathered *after it already has been released*?

2.  Vertical Integration as a Response to Uncertainty and Asymmetric
    Information

    a.  According to Hanssen, why is it important to make commitments
        about exhibiting a movie before the movie has been released?

    b.  According to Hanssen, what is the downside of making these
        commitments before the movie has been released?

    c.  To balance the tradeoff Hanssen identifies, one option is to
        include a mechanism in the contract to shorten or lengthen the
        running time of a move. Why is this hard to do?

    d.  Who has better information about the quality of the movie--the
        distributor or the theater owner? How reliable is this inside
        information?

    e.  Who has better information about the audience--the distributor
        or the theater owner? How reliable is this inside information?

    f.  Hanssen argues that vertical integration avoided the need for
        nuanced contracts that provide for resetting the length of a
        movie's run by meeting three needs. What was the first?

    g.  What was the second?

    h.  What was the third?

    i.  To determine whether vertical integration actually was
        facilitating adjustments in run times, Hanssen compared the
        frequency of these adjustments at vertically integrated theaters
        with adjustments at independently owned theaters. What did he
        find?

    j.  Once vertical integration became illegal, what else could the
        industry do to base run rates for a film on ex post evidence (of
        whether the audience actually liked it), instead of ex ante
        predictions (of whether they will like it once they see it)?
        (Hint: Does a movie have to be released everywhere at the same
        time?)

    k.  True or False: Vertical integration can be a response to
        uncertainty and asymmetric information.

    l.  In what other industry did we see organizations serving as a
        substitute for contracts?

3.  Providing the public with the opportunity to see movies requires
    cooperation from multiple parties. A central theme of this course is
    that cooperation requires trust. Since the parties have to perform
    their obligations at different times, the other parties have "hold
    up" opportunities, which take advantage of the fact that their
    counterparties have already performed. In the long-run, this
    strategic behavior--and, indeed, the mere possibility of it--can
    undercut cooperation and reduce the supply of movies to the public.
    De Vany highlights a few of these strategic opportunities.

    a.  Once the producers' costs in making a specific movie are "sunk,"
        is it rational for them to accept unfavorable terms to exhibit
        it, so they can recover *at least some* of their costs?

    b.  Could this unfavorable deal on a specific movie affect the
        producers' willingness to make other movies in the future (whose
        costs have not yet been incurred)?

    c.  True or false: Exhibitors have a short term interest in striking
        very favorable terms with producers but a long term interest in
        keeping producers in business.

    d.  Once an exhibitor has agreed to show a film, does a distributor
        have a short-term incentive to rent the film to other exhibitors
        in the neighborhood, who might compete with the exhibitor? If a
        distributor takes this step, could this influence the
        exhibitor's willingness to exhibit the next film?

    e.  True or false: Distributors have a short term interest in
        renting the film widely, but a long-term interest in being more
        selective to protect their relationships with exhibitors and
        earn licensing income on future films.

    f.  If exhibitors share revenue with producers, do the exhibitors
        recoup the full benefit of keeping their theater cleaner and
        more attractive than other theaters? If not, could this affect
        their incentives to invest in the quality of their theaters?

    g.  Distributors want exhibitors to pay on time. What leverage do
        they have if they only produce movies occasionally? What if they
        have a regular stream of product? Does it help for the parties
        to deal with each other regularly?

    h.  True or false: While producers, distributors, and exhibitors all
        have an interest in cooperating--if only because they all depend
        on each other--they have short-term incentives to take advantage
        of each other, and opportunities to do so arise because they
        perform their obligations at different times. As a result,
        creative contracting and organizational approaches are needed to
        maintain trust and cooperation.

4.  Minimum Price

    a.  In the studio era, when a distributor licensed a film to an
        exhibitor, the license typically required the exhibitor to
        charge a minimum ticket price in showing the movie to the
        public. In *Paramount*, the Court deemed this minimum ticket
        price an illegal price fixing conspiracy: "'a price structure is
        erected which regulates the licensees\' ability to compete
        against one another in admission price,'\" the Court said,
        quoting the district court. "That consequence seems to us to be
        incontestable." Please offer a defense of the Court's
        conclusion. Why might this be the case, at least in some cases?

    b.  Does it strengthen or weaken the Court's argument if it is easy
        for new theaters to be opened? Does De Vany say that this sort
        of entry was easy or hard?

    c.  As De Vany explains, there can be other reasons for setting a
        minimum ticket price. Assume that Danny Distributor is looking
        to distribute a film in City. He is considering either licensing
        it exclusively to Ellen Exhibitor, or licensing it both to her
        and to Eddie Exhibitor. Through the license, Danny will earn 50%
        of ticket revenue after the exhibitor has recovered its costs.

    d.  Review: why is Danny likely to license the movie for a
        percentage of ticket sales, rather than a fixed price?

    e.  What is downside of licensing only to Ellen?

    f.  What is the risk of licensing to both Ellen and Eddie? How would
        specifying a minimum ticket price help address this downside?
        Why should the minimum price be Eddie and Ellen's customary
        price?

5.  Assume that Danny grants an exclusive license to Ellen in exchange
    for 50% of ticket revenue after Ellen has recovered her costs. Ellen
    decides to offer tickets for \$8 (instead of the usual \$10) to any
    customer who spends at least \$5 on snacks. How might this promotion
    disserve Danny's interests? What condition could he specify to
    protect those interests?

6.  Assume again that Danny grants an exclusive license to Ellen in
    exchange for 50% of ticket revenue after Ellen has recovered her
    costs. If Ellen is unscrupulous enough to report dishonest numbers
    as a way to keep more of the ticket revenue, what are the two
    numbers she might understate. How, if at all, does a minimum ticket
    price help to protect Danny?

7.  Clearance

    a.  What is "clearance"?

    b.  Danny is negotiating a license with Ellen. Erik has just opened
        another theater down the street from Ellen, and he also wants a
        license. Danny offers Ellen the license to exhibit the movie
        first, and is willing to commit not to let Erik have a license
        during the first two weeks.

        i.  The Court said that clearances are not per se illegal. "A
            clearance when used to protect that interest of the
            exhibitor was reasonable," the Court explained, referencing
            the district court's conclusion, "when not unduly extended
            as to area or duration." Under this standard, is the
            clearance Danny proposed above acceptable?

        ii. What if Danny offers the same clearance for ten consecutive
            movies? The Court expressed suspicion about "the clearances
            . . . in vogue," which "had . . . acquired a fixed and
            uniform character and were made applicable to situations
            without regard to the special circumstances which are
            necessary to sustain them as reasonable restraints of
            trade." Do you think the Court would view the multi-movie
            license to Ellen as violating the antitrust laws?

        iii. Please defend the multi-movie clearance provision. Are
             there reasons why the clearance in a particular place
             should remain the same for essentially every movie? Does De
             Vany think this is evidence of anti-competitive motives?

        iv. Although the same clearance might be specified ex ante for
            different movies, is the "run" for each certain to be the
            same? Why or why not? Should this be relevant to the
            antitrust analysis?

        v.  Ellen licenses one of Danny's movies, *All the President's
            Dogs*, for a three week "first run." The license also
            specifies that she will continue to show the movie for
            another two weeks if the average daily box office total in
            the third week exceeds \$30,000. Ellen has another license
            to show another movie, *The Phantom Matrix*, starting in
            three weeks. If the first movie meets its "holdover" target,
            how does Ellen work out her conflicting commitment to two
            different movies? What was the market practice in the Studio
            era?

        vi. We have discussed why clearance policies are good for Danny
            and Ellen. Why are they also good for the viewing public?

8.  Formula Deals and Franchises

    a.  Ellen owns fifteen theaters across the country, while Eddie and
        Erik each own only one theater. Danny offers Ellen a more
        favorable deal, giving her discretion to choose which of her
        theaters should display his films (a "blanket deal"). Danny
        gives Ellen a license for all his movies for more than one
        season (a "franchise"). Ellen's royalty is based on ticket sales
        nationally, not just in the specific theater showing the movie
        (a "formula deal"). The Court invalidated these contractual
        terms as "devices for stifling competition and diverting the
        cream of the business to the large operators." What do you think
        troubled the Court?

    b.  Are there other explanations for these contractual terms?
        Specifically, why is it advantageous both to Ellen and to Danny
        for Ellen to have discretion about which movie to show?

    c.  What is the advantage to Ellen and Danny in basing the royalty
        on national ticket sales, instead of sales in her theaters?

9.  Blind Selling and Block Booking

    a.  Danny and Ellen sign a licensing agreement for a movie that has
        not been produced yet. As a result, Ellen obviously cannot see
        the movie before committing to exhibit it. The Court expressed
        concern that this was a sign that the market was not
        sufficiently competitive: "By this practice a distributor could
        promise a picture of good quality or of a certain type which
        when produced might prove to be of poor quality or of another
        type \-- a competing distributor meanwhile being unable to
        market its product and in the end losing its outlets for future
        pictures." Is there another reason why Danny wants to line up
        licenses for a movie before it is made?

    b.  Danny offers Ellen a license not just for a single movie, but
        for all forty movies that Danny plans to distribute in the
        coming year. The Court disallowed "block booking" contracts,
        viewing them as "devices for stifling competition and diverting
        the cream of the business to the large operators." Instead, the
        Court required the contract to allow Ellen to reject any film
        she did not want. What do you think was the Court's concern?

    c.  Assume that Film A is expected to be really popular and Film B
        is of much lower quality. In principle, the distributor might
        try to use her leverage through Film A--something everyone
        wants--to force exhibitors to take Film B as well. But isn't
        there a more straightforward way for the distributor to take
        advantage of the popularity of Film A? Why not just do that?

    d.  There are other explanations for block booking, aside from the
        anticompetitive one that concerned the Court. Why might it be
        helpful both to Danny and to Ellen to license a block of movies,
        instead of licensing one at a time?
