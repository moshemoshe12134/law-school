**Discussion Questions #10 (Panel 3):**

**Nonprofits\--a Harder Problem Than Venture Capital?:**

**Challenges in Measuring and Rewarding Progress**

1.  Review of Challenges in Venture Capital

    a.  What information problems are there in venture capital?

    b.  What incentive problems are there in venture capital?

    c.  Do you think the information problems make the incentive
        problems harder?

2.  Special Problems at Nonproblems: To see them, let's compare two
    scenarios---one involving a for-profit firm, and one involving a
    nonprofit

    a.  Alice is a board member at Forprofit Corp ("FC"), and Ben is
        FC's CEO. FC has two businesses: a restaurant and a catering
        business. At a board meeting, Ben tells Alice and the rest of
        the board that he wants to stop the restaurant, and keep only
        the catering business.

        i.  To vet this decision, what is the first question Alice
            should ask?

        ii. Assume that running a restaurant requires more work from
            management than catering. Why might Ben try to hide this
            fact from Alice?

        iii. If this is the reason why Ben wants to shut the restaurant,
             how feasible is it for Alice to figure this out?

    b.  Alice is also a board member at Nonprofit ("NP"), and Candace is
        NP's CEO. NP has two programs: they run a soup kitchen and they
        run an afterschool basketball program for disadvantaged young
        people. Candace tells Alice and the rest of the board that she
        wants to end the soup kitchen and focus only on basketball.

    c.  Compared with Ben's proposal in the previous question, is
        Candace's plan easier or harder for Alice to vet?

    d.  Assume that the soup kitchen requires more work from management.
        Why might Candace try to hide this fact from Alice?

    e.  If this is the reason why Candace wants to shut the soup
        kitchen, how feasible is it for Alice to figure this out?

    f.  The last two questions illustrate the fundamental challenge at
        nonprofits that is emphasized in *How to Save the World*.

        i.  What is the problem?

        ii. Is this a problem of information? Or of incentives? Or both?

        iii. What parallel do you see to venture capital?

        iv. Can the nonprofit form be explained as a solution to
            information and incentive problems?

        v.  Does the nonprofit form creates a range of information and
            incentive problems of its own?

3.  Inertia

    a.  Doug and Ellen work at Institution, which provides goods and
        services to the public. To do this work, Institution has
        standard operating procedures, which it has used for many years.
        What it be practical for Doug and Ellen to rethink those
        standard operating procedures every morning when they arrive at
        work?

    b.  Does every organization needs standard operating procedures to
        do its work?

    c.  Institution's standard operating procedures used to be really
        effective. But the market they serve has changed, so Institution
        should change some of these procedures to keep up with the
        times. Are there reasons why Doug and Ellen might resist
        changing these procedures?

    d.  Do you think inertia is a challenge at every institution? Why
        might it be a greater challenge at a nonprofit than at a
        for-profit firm?

    e.  Is inertia caused by information problems? Or incentive
        problems? Or both?

4.  Challenges in Resolving Conflicts

    a.  Frank and Georgia work at Investment Bank, while Hannah and Ike
        work at Nonprofit. Assume that all four of them are ambitious
        and capable, and that they enjoy their work. Assume also that
        Frank and Georgia disagree about the best strategy for
        Investment Bank to maximize profits, and that Hannah and Ike
        disagree about the best way to advance Nonprofit's mission. Why
        might the disagreement at Nonprofit be more heated? What
        connection, if any, is there to the fundamental challenge at
        nonprofits discussed in question #2.

    b.  Similarly, why might it be harder to reach a compromise at
        Nonprofit?

5.  Effectiveness of the Nondistribution Constraint

    a.  Lucy, who lives in NY, wants to give money to help poor children
        in her hometown of Chicago. She finds out about a nonprofit
        called "Chicago Kids" or "CK," studies their website, and
        confirms that their mission is to help low-income children in
        Chicago. She also confirms that "CK" is a nonprofit, and that
        the CEO's name is Marvin, and the Board Chair's name is Natalie.
        If CK runs a surplus, can Marvin and Natalie take it as a
        dividend?

    b.  Which of the following is true?

        i.  Natalie cannot be compensated as a board member of a
            nonprofit.

        ii. CK's rent per square foot must be below the median rent in
            Chicago's real estate market.

        iii. Natalie cannot be Marvin's childhood friend or his
             relative, since this sort of personal tie between a board
             chair and CEO would represent an impermissible conflict.

        iv. Marvin cannot take 8 weeks of vacation every year.

        v.  Marvin cannot receive an 8% raise three years in a row.

        vi. Marvin cannot receive a bonus equal to 5% of the surplus
            that CK runs each year.

        vii. Marvin cannot hire his sister, Olivia, as his chief of
             staff.

        viii. Marvin cannot dedicate 5% of CK's budget to pay for him to
              attend conferences in Europe.

        ix. If Lucy calls the office at 9am or at 4pm on any given
            weekday, Marvin will usually be there.

    c.  How reliable is the nondistribution constraint in keeping
        nonprofit managers and boards from skimping on quality or
        overcharging beneficiaries?

6.  Incentive Compensation

    a.  What role does incentive compensation play in venture capital?
        Why?

    b.  As a legal matter, can similar compensation be used at
        nonprofits?

    c.  Can a nonprofit designate specific goals and reward employees
        for achieving them? Can those goals relate to the size of the
        surplus? Can they relate to progress in achieving the mission?

    d.  Why is compensation described in "c" potentially hard to
        implement?

    e.  Peter is the new CEO of a for-profit hospital. Before the board
        hired him, the hospital's profits were an unimpressive 4% of
        capital invested. The board wants the hospital to earn at least
        8%.

        i.  How can the board motivate Peter to double the profits?

        ii. What incentive does the board itself have to press Peter for
            better corporate performance?

        iii. Do you think supervisors usually like to fire people? Or to
             eliminate perquisites that their colleagues like? Why do
             they do it?

    f.  Quentin is the new CEO of a nonprofit hospital. Before the board
        hired him, the hospital was consistently losing money. The board
        wants the hospital to break even.

        i.  Can the board motivate Quentin in the same way that the
            for-profit hospital board is motivating Peter (in the last
            problem)?

        ii. In a nonprofit, are there other reasons why professionals
            might be motivated to perform well, which are less likely in
            a for-profit firm?

        iii. How do the incentives of nonprofit boards compare with
             those of a for-profit board?

        iv. Do you think Quentin is more or less likely than Peter to
            fire people?

7.  Agency Costs

    a.  Richard is the new CEO of a chain of for-profit restaurants in
        major cities across the U.S., and you are a member of his
        company's board. Richard's predecessor, Sally, was on the road
        half the time, visiting the restaurants and meeting with their
        managers. Sally's motto as a manager was, "there's no substitute
        for being there." She believed that her periodic visits
        motivated the manager of each restaurant to work harder, and
        that her visits allowed her to share good ideas from one
        restaurant with others. Sally also loved traveling, and was
        proud of having elite "platinum" status at a number of airlines
        and hotels. On each trip, when the work day ended, she made
        plans with one of her many friends in each of the relevant
        cities. Richard is going to try a different approach. He is
        scheduling an individual video conference with each restaurant
        manager every two weeks, and a group video chat for everyone
        every two weeks as well. He plans to travel once a month to
        visit a restaurant "live," and will visit each of the 36
        locations every three years (instead of every year, as Sally
        did). As a board member, you are trying to evaluate whether
        Richard is right to make this change. What information can help
        you to make that judgment over time?

    b.  Tina is the new CEO of a network of welfare centers and soup
        kitchens across the U.S., and you are a member of his
        nonprofit's board. Tina's predecessor, Ursula, was on the road
        half the time, visiting the welfare centers and meeting with
        their managers. Like Sally, Ursula's motto as a manager was,
        "there's no substitute for being there." She believed that her
        periodic visits motivated the manager of each welfare center to
        work harder, and that her visits allowed her to share good ideas
        from one center with others. Like Sally, Urusla also loved
        traveling, accumulating frequent flier miles, and seeing friends
        in every city. Like Richard, Tina is going to try a different
        approach, relying more on video conferences and less on "live"
        visits. As a board member, you are trying to evaluate whether
        Tina is right to make this change. What information can help you
        to make that judgment over time? Is your job evaluating Tina's
        judgment harder or easier or no different than the job of
        evaluating whether Richard is right in the last problem?

8.  How to Save the World suggests ways to deal with incentive and
    information problems at nonprofits. Specifically, the book says that
    the best nonprofits are effective at two tasks.

    a.  What are these tasks?

    b.  The book also suggests synergies in these tasks--that is,
        working on each one can help a nonprofit make progress on the
        other. What are those synergies?
