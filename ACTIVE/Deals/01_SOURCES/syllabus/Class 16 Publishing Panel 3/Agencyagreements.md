# **[AN AUTHOR'S GUIDE TO AGENCY AGREEMENTS]{.mark}**

[Reprinted from the Fall 2017/ Winter 2018 *Authors Guild
Bulletin*]{.mark}

[Agreements between authors and agents can be tricky things. Sometimes
there's a written contract setting out the terms of the relationship,
sometimes there isn't. And even when there *is* a contract, the language
it uses can seem alien to non-lawyers. But, since this is one of the
most crucial professional relationships in an author's life, it's vital
that you understand it clearly. To help you navigate the mysteries of
the agency agreement, we've compiled a guide of key points for you to
keep in mind.]{.mark}

## **[I. LITERARY AGENT REPRESENTATION --- THE RELATIONSHIP]{.mark}**

[Before addressing the major issues to be considered in an author-agent
*contract*, let's explore what authors need to know about the
*relationship* between author and agent*.*]{.mark}

*[The Agent Owes a "Fiduciary Duty" to the Author]{.mark}*

[A literary agent or agency has a "fiduciary" relationship with its
author clients; this means that you are placing a greater level of trust
in your agent than you do in other commercial dealings, such as your
relationship with your publisher. Because of this heightened level of
trust, an agency has a fiduciary obligation to its clients, and must
therefore always put the author's interests above its own and avoid any
conflict of interest with its clients. If you find that your agent is
not acting in this way, you may want to seek another agent (as well as
note down any ways in which the agent has not met its fiduciary
obligations to you, in case you want to pursue legal remedies in the
future).]{.mark}

*[Agency Agreement vs. Agency Clause --- Pros and Cons]{.mark}*

[A number of literary agencies do not provide their clients with written
agency agreements, but instead rely solely upon the agency clauses that
will be inserted into the publishing and motion picture agreements. It's
best, though, to have a written agency agreement in place to prevent any
misunderstandings as to the terms of the arrangement, and to define the
terms in the event of termination.]{.mark}

[Recommendations]{.mark}

[If the agency does not provide the author with a written agency
agreement, it is best to ask for one to make sure all terms are
understood and agreed upon. If the agency does not provide a contract
and insists on relying on an agency clause, then before retaining the
agency the author should ask to review and approve the clause used by
that agency in the contracts it negotiates. It is best to do this by
e-mail so that you have a written record and to acknowledge that you
agree to the terms, so that there is a legally binding
agreement.]{.mark}

*[The Agency Clause]{.mark}*

[An agency clause (such as is often added to publishing and other
licensing agreements) may also set out the terms of the relationship
between the author and the agent. Such clauses usually:]{.mark}

1.  [Provide that all sums payable to the author shall be paid to and in
    the name of the agency.]{.mark}

2.  [Stipulate the percentage commission that the agency is entitled to
    deduct from amounts payable to the author (these are generally
    standard and non-negotiable --- see below); and]{.mark}

3.  [Provide that the agency is entitled to act on the author's behalf
    in all matters arising out of the publishing or other applicable
    agreement.]{.mark}

[Many agency clauses (and agreements) state that there is "an agency
coupled with an interest". This phrase should be deleted, since if the
agency relationship is truly an "agency coupled with an interest", the
relationship would then be irrevocable. In fact, almost every agency
clause *is* revocable by the author, and courts and legal commentators
agree that merely inserting language in an agency agreement or clause
stating that it is "an agency coupled with an interest" doesn't create
an unbreakable relationship unless the agent actually has an interest in
the author's work apart from the mere right to receive
commissions.]{.mark}

[Recommendations]{.mark}

[Authors should carefully review the agency clause, as well as any agent
representation agreements, to confirm that the scope of the agency
clause or agreement does not exceed the rights the author intends to
grant to the agent. If an agency clause is to be used instead of a
representation agreement, the author should (i) review a sample clause
provided by the agency and get a representation in writing (e-mail is
fine) that the sample provided is the one that will be used in future
agreements, and (ii) confirm agreement to the agency clause in writing
(again, e-mail works) to create a binding agreement.]{.mark}

*[Beware of Reading Fees]{.mark}*

[The Association of Authors' Representatives (the leading trade
association for literary agents), includes in its Canon of Ethics a
prohibition against members charging fees to potential or existing
clients to read and evaluate their writings. If an agent charges
"reading fees," the author should seriously consider finding an agent
who does not, since such fees are not customarily charged by leading
literary agents.]{.mark}

## **[II. AGENCY AGREEMENTS --- PRINCIPAL PROVISIONS]{.mark}**

[Now that you have, we hope, a clearer understanding of how the agency
relationship works, let's move on to the contracts themselves. Here are
some major points to consider when you're asked to sign an agreement
with a literary agent or agency:]{.mark}

*[What Works Are Covered]{.mark}*

[An agent may wish to represent only a client's new work, all of the
client's work, or just every work the client writes during a stated
period of time. (To be clear, the agent's rights to represent the work
are usually granted in perpetuity, or until the relationship is
terminated under the terms of the contract or by the mutual agreement of
the agent and the author.)]{.mark}

[Recommendations]{.mark}

[The agreement usually covers only one work (except where multi-book
deals are involved) and that work should be defined as specifically as
possible --- at least by its subject matter and, if possible, by its
tentative title.]{.mark}

*[Rights Granted During the Term of the Agreement]{.mark}*

[An agency agreement gives an agent the right to sell the work to a
publisher for a specific number of months, or even years. Normally, the
agent is appointed the author's exclusive worldwide agent to sell,
license or otherwise negotiate the transfer of rights in the work
covered by the agreement, for the term set out in the agreement; this
means that the agent alone is entitled to act on the author's behalf in
negotiating the exploitation of the work(s) covered by the agreement.
The agent should also have the right to appoint sub-agents to handle the
transfer rights that the primary agent may not be equipped to
handle --- such as outside the U.S. and Canada or in foreign languages,
as well as other non-publishing rights, such as motion picture,
television and theatrical rights.]{.mark}

[Recommendations]{.mark}

1.  [**Termination**: As a general matter, an author should have the
    right to terminate the agency agreement if the agent doesn't make a
    book publishing deal within the agreed upon number of months. Even
    if the agent agrees to such a right to terminate, however, the
    agency is normally entitled to receive commissions on deals the
    agency procured prior to the author's termination of the
    relationship. Therefore, the agent should still be entitled to
    receive commissions if, within 90 days (or sometimes up to 180 days)
    after termination, the author enters into a publishing agreement
    with a house with which the agency negotiated the basic terms of a
    deal prior to termination.\
    Some agencies will insist that they are entitled to receive
    commissions if they submitted the author's work to the ultimate
    publisher, even if they did not negotiate the basic terms of the
    publishing agreement. The author should resist agreeing to
    compensate the agency in these circumstances. Remember, if another
    agent is subsequently retained and actually negotiates the deal,
    that agency is usually entitled to receive its own commissions. A
    fair compromise where the original agent submitted the work is to
    give that agent an additional period (of up to six months from the
    date of termination) in which to substantially negotiate a deal for
    that manuscript. As an alternative, the agency agreement should give
    the author the right to demand a list of places where the agency has
    submitted the author's manuscript; if an agency insists on receiving
    commissions in perpetuity from deals that were negotiated but not
    concluded during the agency term, then the author should at least
    receive a list of those publishers to whom the agency submitted the
    work.]{.mark}

2.  [The scope of representation stated above (including the right to
    appoint sub-agents to transfer rights outside the U.S. and Canada in
    the English language, in foreign languages and other non-publishing
    rights such as motion picture, television and theatrical rights) is
    usually acceptable in the industry, except in the rare occasion
    where the author has a pre-existing relationship with a motion
    picture agent.]{.mark}

3.  [The agreement should require that the agency keep the author
    regularly advised as to all negotiations on the author's
    behalf.]{.mark}

4.  [The agency should be expressly prohibited from *signing* any deal,
    memo, publishing agreement or subsidiary rights agreement on the
    author's behalf. The client author is the only party who should sign
    such agreements granting rights to the author's work. When an agent
    signs a deal on behalf of the author, misunderstandings can occur
    and rights can be granted without the author's knowledge or
    approval. It is a recipe for the agency relationship to go
    sour.]{.mark}

*[Agent Commissions]{.mark}*

[The following rates are considered to be standard in the
industry:]{.mark}

1.  [Commissions on domestic book publishing and performance rights
    (motion picture, television and live stage rights) agreements are
    generally 15 percent of the gross amounts payable to the
    author.]{.mark}

2.  [Commissions on foreign rights agreements are generally 20 percent
    of the gross amounts payable to the author on foreign rights deals
    (although some agents charge a higher commission on sales in certain
    foreign countries where the amounts received are generally very
    small for the efforts involved). These commissions are generally
    standard and non-negotiable, although it is best to seek to ensure
    that the 20 percent royalty rate (as opposed to 15 percent) only
    applies on foreign sales if a sub-agent is used.]{.mark}

*[Payments to The Author by The Agent]{.mark}*

[Most agency agreements provide that all advances and royalties payable
to the author under any publishing or other agreement for exploitation
of rights in the author's applicable work will be paid to and in the
name of the agency, which will deduct its commissions (and any expenses
covered elsewhere in the agency agreement) and then remit the balance to
the author.]{.mark}

[Recommendations]{.mark}

1.  [The agency should be required to remit monies due to the author
    within ten days (or within a mutually agreed upon fixed period of
    time) after receipt by the agent.]{.mark}

2.  [The agency should be required to hold all monies received on behalf
    of the author in the agency's client trust account rather than in
    the agency's general account. (This is the practice of most
    reputable agents in any event.)]{.mark}

3.  [If the agreement (or agency clause) provides that the agency's
    commissions are payable "as an agency coupled with an interest,"
    this phrase should be deleted (for the reasons set forth
    above).]{.mark}

4.  [The agency should provide the author with copies of all fully
    executed license agreements and royalty statements it receives for
    the work.]{.mark}

5.  [The agency should agree to give the author a semi-annual or annual
    accounting of monies it received on the author's behalf.]{.mark}

6.  [The agreement should expressly provide that if the author
    terminates the agency agreement after the agency has made a sale,
    then the agency will sign an amendment to any \[publishing or
    other\] agreement \[in which its agency clause was inserted\] with
    respect to the work which would provide that:\
    a. The agency is no longer authorized to act as the author's agent
    with respect to the work covered by the applicable agreement (i.e.,
    the agency will not negotiate any future amendments or new
    agreements regarding the work); and\
    b. The agency's share of commissions will be paid directly to the
    agency by the publisher and the balance shall be paid directly to
    the author or the author's designee.]{.mark}

7.  [The agency should not be entitled to receive commissions on sales
    of rights in the work made after termination of the agency agreement
    by the author --- unless the agency has been responsible for
    procuring such sale or such sale had been substantially negotiated
    by the agency prior to termination of the agency agreement.]{.mark}

*[Expenses]{.mark}*

[The agency may be expressly entitled to deduct from money owed to the
author expenses such as those for postage, messengers, bank charges,
photocopying a manuscript and sending copies of a manuscript to foreign
publishers and /or sub-agents.]{.mark}

[Recommendations]{.mark}

[The author should be entitled to approve each expenditure in excess of
\$75.00 (or another mutually agreed upon amount) before it is deducted;
or alternatively, the parties should establish a firm cap total of
expenses after which additional expenses must be individually
approved.]{.mark}

*[Warranties, Representations and Indemnities]{.mark}*

[Occasionally, agency agreements contain warranties, representations and
indemnities from the author to the agency similar to those found in
publishing agreements.]{.mark}

[Recommendations]{.mark}

[The author should seek to delete these provisions from the agreement.
Although the author will have to assume such obligations in any book
publishing agreement to protect the publisher against claims or lawsuits
regarding the contents of the author's literary work, the author's agent
is not exposed to such risks and therefore does not need such
protections.]{.mark}

*[Assignability]{.mark}*

[The agreement may provide that it is assignable by the agency.]{.mark}

[Recommendations]{.mark}

[Because an agency agreement is a fiduciary one, the agreement should
prohibit assignment by the agency of the agency agreement to another
agency. However, there is usually no reason to object to the agency's
ability to assign its right to receive commissions.]{.mark}
