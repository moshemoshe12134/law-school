**Discussion Questions \# 16: Authors, Agents & Publishers (Panel 3)**

1.  Your college roommate, Barbara, is a management consultant. Her job
    is to do an assessment of troubled companies and suggest ways to
    turn them around. She is the founder and principal of "Turnaround
    Consulting" or "TC."

> Barbara decides to write a business book, *Turning It Around: How to
> Turn a Failed Business into a Market Leader*. She has the urge to
> share what she knows, and she also wants to use the book to raise her
> profile, hoping it will help her broaden her base of clients.
>
> Barbara doesn't get much repeat business, since the executives she
> advises usually are a bit embarrassed about having to hire her and
> want to forget the anxious experience of nearly going bankrupt, so
> they don't usually stay in touch or hire her again. This means she
> needs a constant stream of new work to stay busy.
>
> To help her attract more consulting work, Barbara is hoping to get a
> publishing contract with an elite publishing house, which has the
> resources to help her make it a best seller. But these publishing
> houses generally won't deal with an author directly. They usually
> accept proposals only from a literary agent, who is supposed to submit
> the book proposal on the author's behalf.
>
> As a backup, Barbara is also open to publishing the book in an
> academic press, although she knows that her royalty on the book will
> be significantly lower and the academic press will not do as much to
> market the book. In this situation, she will do her best to market it
> on her own.
>
> This is all new territory for Barbara, and she appreciates that you
> are willing to give her legal and business advice when she needs it.
> She starts by calling you with two questions:

a.  Why do you think elite publishing houses work only with agents? What
    incentive or information problems are the agents meant to solve?

b.  Why do you think this function is thought to be less important in
    academic presses?

2.  Barbara has a friend, Chris, who published a book recently after
    hiring Alice, a literary agent. After Chris introduces Barbara to
    Alice, Barbara shares her a draft of the book proposal she plans to
    use, which gives an overview of the book, summarizes her own
    experience, and explains the potential market for the book. They
    meet for breakfast, and Alice says she is open to representing
    Barbara.

    a.  Barbara asks what Alice's strategy will be for selling the book
        to a publisher. Alice says she will put together a list of ten
        publishing houses, run the list by Barbara, and then send the
        proposal to editors she knows at these houses. When Barbara asks
        for examples of the houses Alice has in mind, Alice smiles and
        says, "Well, you have to hire me first, and then we can talk in
        detail about that." After the breakfast, Barbara calls and
        repeats this to you and asks if you think Alice's position is
        reasonable. Or should Barbara be worried?

    b.  If the above comment can be read as either harmless or
        concerning, how (if at all) can Barbara learn more to try to
        make a judgment about this?

3.  Alice sends Barbara a draft contract to formalize her status as
    Barbara's agent. "Take a look at it and let me know if you have any
    question," Alice says in her email.

> Alice charges a commission that (among other things) provides her with
> 15% of "Gross Proceeds" from "the Property." She sends you the
> relevant language:
>
> *You, Barbara (the "Author"), hereby engage Alice (the "Agent") as the
> Author's **sole and exclusive Agen**t to negotiate for the
> publication, and other disposition throughout the world of the
> hardcover, paperback rights, books on tape, television, motion
> picture, electronic and ancillary and allied rights whether now or to
> become known in the future, as customarily understood within the
> entertainment industry ("Rights") in and to the Author's properties
> (the "Properties") a book tentatively entitled "Turning It Around: How
> to Turn a Failed Business into a Market Leader."*
>
> *In full consideration of Agent's services hereunder, the Author
> agrees to pay Agent a commission equal to Fifteen Percent (15%) of all
> "Gross Proceeds" derived from the exploitation of the Rights except
> Ten Percent (10%) from the exploitation of television and film
> ("Compensation"). "Gross Proceeds" are hereby defined as meaning all
> monies, receipts and consideration of every kind (including salaries,
> royalties, bonuses, shares of profits, loans, speaking fees,
> consulting fees, and any and all other forms of cash compensation),
> paid to the Author or to any designee of the Author, arising out of or
> paid pursuant to the disposition and/or exploitation of the Rights and
> the subject matter discussed in the Properties, pursuant to written or
> oral agreements negotiated by Agent or the Author (including any
> renewals, modifications, options or extensions thereof, regardless of
> when made and regardless of by whom negotiated)*

a.  Given what you know about Barbara's professional life, what concern
    do you have about the definition of "gross proceeds"?

b.  How might Alice try to justify a broad definition of "gross
    proceeds"?

c.  What modifications in the language would you suggest--either to
    modify the definition or to add other language?

<!-- -->

4.  Alice's draft agreement includes the following language about
    terminating the agreement:

> *Agent agrees to use such reasonable efforts on the Author's behalf as
> Agent deems appropriate to cause the disposition of the Rights.
> However, Agent makes no representation that Agent will in fact effect
> such disposition. If within 12 months of execution of this Agreement
> Agent has failed to obtain a bona fide offer for the disposition of
> one of the Rights to the Property, acceptable to the Author, the
> Author may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Agent upon
> written receipt by Agent subject to the Continuation period pursuant
> to 2(b).*
>
> *If the Author receives a proposal with respect to the Rights during
> the Term of this Agreement, the Author will promptly refer such
> proposal to Agent. All contracts and other arrangements negotiated by
> Agent on the Author's behalf shall be subject to the Author's approval
> and shall be in the Author's name or in such other name as designated
> by the Author in writing. Notwithstanding anything herein contained to
> the contrary, the Author reserves all rights to himself to accept or
> reject any offer for the disposition of any Rights to the Property and
> the Agent has no right or authority to bind, or otherwise create an
> obligation for, the Author or his Rights or the Property.*
>
> *The Author shall have no obligation to Agent, at any time with regard
> to any other existing or future literary projects or any other project
> the Author may wish to undertake and exploit, by themselves or through
> any other person, firm or entity acting as the Author's agent except
> for the obligations set forth in this Agreement. Agent has the
> authority to represent to others that she is the Author's Agent.
> Irrespective of whether or not Author hires a subsequent agent, Agent
> shall be the agent on the next book published if the publisher
> ("Publisher") of the Property publishes the Author's next book.*

a.  Why is it important for the agreement not to be indefinite? What
    information or incentive problems does this solve?

b.  Why is it important for the agreement to have a stated term, so that
    Barbara cannot terminate it at will? What information or incentive
    problems does this solve? What information or incentive problems
    does this term create?

c.  The contract provides that even after the agreement is terminated,
    Alice still earns a commission on gross proceeds from a deal "within
    six (6) months after the end of the Term ("Continuation Period")
    with any purchaser who evidenced during the Term an indication of
    interest in negotiating or executing such an Agreement. Upon such
    termination and upon Author's request, Agent will furnish to you a
    list of publishers and other parties to whom she submitted the
    materials related to the Property (or the Property itself). If
    during the Continuation Period, the Author sells or transfers any of
    the Rights in the Book to a person or company on this list, Agent
    shall be entitled to her full commission under this Agreement with
    respect to the Property."

    i.  Is it reasonable for Barbara to agree to this?

    ii. Why should Alice have to provide the list to Barbara? In what
        context is she likely to use this list?

d.  Barbara also asks you the following question: "I see that Alice is
    automatically my agent on my second book, if I publish it with the
    publisher who published my first book. Is it reasonable for Alice to
    ask for that?" What is your answer?

e.  Assuming Barbara is generally willing to agree to the term discussed
    in "d," should Barbara ask for any limits on Alice's claim
    automatically to be the agent on the second book? (First hint:
    assume Alice is seventy-five years old.) (Second hint: assume that
    Barbara is very demanding and at times can come across as abrasive,
    a reality that reinforces the pattern, noted above, that she does
    not usually have repeat clients.)

<!-- -->

5.  The contract uses the following (complicated) clause to define
    Alice's commission. Barbara has a number of questions about it:

> *[Compensation]{.underline}. In full consideration of Agent's services
> hereunder, the Author agree to pay Agent a commission equal to Fifteen
> Percent (15%) of all "Gross Proceeds" derived from the exploitation of
> the Rights.*
>
> *Moreover, a minimum fee of Six Thousand Dollars (\$6000) ("Minimum
> Payment") is owed to Agent. Three Thousand (\$3000) is due upon
> signing this Agreement and Three Thousand is due when the advance
> accepted by the Author is equal to or less than Twenty-Five Thousand
> Dollars (\$25,000). By way of example: if the advance is Twenty-Five
> Thousand Dollars (\$25,000) or less, the second payment of \$3000
> shall be due to the Agent within ten days of accepting publisher's
> offer.*
>
> *If the advance is greater than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars
> (\$25,000), the second payment is not owed and the \$3000 already paid
> shall be deducted from the Agent's share paid by the Publisher.*
>
> *If the Author does not accept an offer or after the end of one year
> no contract is available, then Agent retains the Three Thousand
> Dollars (\$3000). The Minimum Payment shall be in addition to the
> commission due to Agent in accordance with this section as stated
> above for Fifteen (15%) of Gross Proceeds."*

a.  A minimum fee is not customary for literary agents. Why do you think
    that is the case?

b.  When Barbara asks Alice to remove the minimum fee, Alice declines to
    do so. What explanation do you think Alice is likely to give? (Hint:
    One of her specialties is to represent first-time authors.)

c.  In analyzing whether she is comfortable with the minimum fee, what
    question should Barbara ask Alice? What information would be
    relevant?

d.  If Alice insists on keeping the minimum fee in the contract, what
    signal, if any, does this send to Barbara? Is this new information
    to Barbara?

e.  If Barbara is hesitant about agreeing to pay a minimum fee, what
    signal, if any, does this send to Alice? Is this new information to
    Alice?

f.  Recall that Alice has the right automatically to be the agent on
    Barbara's second book in certain circumstances. In light of this
    right, what change should Barbara request in the above paragraph on
    Alice's commission?

g.  Assume that Barbara's advance for the book (the cash payment she
    receives from the publisher upon signing the contract) is \$25,000.
    What is Alice's commission?

h.  Assume that the advance is much higher--\$50,000. What is Alice's
    commission?

i.  Compare the answers in "g" and "h." What problem do you see? What is
    the source of this problem?

j.  What changes in the formula could fix the problem identified in "i"?
    Please suggest a couple of options. What other problems (if any) do
    these options create?

6.  Barbara hires Alice, and Alice sends the book proposal to a number
    of publishers. Erin Editor from Packaging Press calls the next day
    to say that she is interested, but with a caveat. "Publishing a book
    likes this costs money," Erin says. "The up front cost is about
    \$100,000." Barbara is a first time author, so there is a lot of
    uncertainty about whether her book will sell, and it's a book for a
    targeted professional audience. "Barbara will have to commit to buy
    5,000 copies of the book," Erin says, "and we will charge her \$12
    per copy."

    a.  As Erin said, there is always a risk that the book won't sell.
        Under Erin's proposal, how is that risk allocated? Who loses
        money?

    b.  Alice asks Erin how Barbara can make money on the book. "She can
        then resell them to her clients at whatever price she wants,"
        Erin says. Barbara calls to ask you for business advice about
        this proposal. In deciding whether to do this, what issues
        should she consider?

    c.  Alice asks Erin whether Packaging Press will also try to sell
        the book. "Yes," Erin says. "We will sell it on Amazon." This is
        both good and bad for Barbara. Why?

    d.  Barbara asks how Barbara would be compensated for books that
        Packaging Press sells on Amazon. "It's the usual deal in the
        industry," Erin says. "Barbara will get a 10% royalty for the
        first 5,000 copies sold, a 12% royalty for the next 5,000 copies
        sold, and a 15% royalty for the rest of the books." Is Barbara
        likely to make more on the books she sells herself or on the
        books Packaging sells on Amazon?

    e.  To evaluate the royalties in part "d," what other information do
        you need? (Hint: there are "list" royalties and "net sale"
        royalties and one is better than the other.)

7.  The next day, Alice gets a call from Ed Editor, who works at
    Publisher Press ("PP"). Ed also is interested in publishing the
    book, so he sends Alice a draft contract (which was assigned as
    reading) and Alice shares it with Barbara.

    a.  In this deal, who bears the risk that the book won't sell well?

    b.  In Ed's draft contract, when (if ever) does Barbara have to buy
        books? (Hint: Look at section 8.) If it is a priority to Barbara
        not to have to buy books, how concerned should she be about the
        offer from PP? To what extent (if at all) does Barbara control
        whether she has to buy books?

    c.  In PP's offer, how is Barbara compensated? How is this different
        from Erin's offer? Which is better? What other information do
        you want in order to compare them?

    d.  ["Remaindering" a book means that the publisher has too much
        stock of a book, so they sell it off at a very low price. There
        are companies who buy and distribute remainders. Alice Agent
        objects to the way remainder sales are structured in PP's draft
        contrac. What do you think is her concern? What argument should
        she make to change it? (Hint--how are these sales treated
        differently than other sales?) What argument do you think PP
        will make? (Hint--it has to do with incentives.)]{.mark}

8.  Since you are a lawyer, Barbara calls you with some questions about
    PP's proposed contract.

    a.  Barbara is very meticulous about language. She thinks carefully
        about every word, and she writes and rewrites and rewrites again
        in order to get it just right. Who has the final say about the
        language under this contract? What change, if any, might Barbara
        want to make in the contract?

    b.  Barbara wants an index. Under the proposed contract, will PP
        provide one?

    c.  Barbara wants an e-book version made. Is PP committing to do
        one? If not, can Barbara arrange for this separately with
        another publisher? What changes, if any, do you think should be
        made to this provision? (Hint: see Secton 3.)

    d.  Barbara has a temper. She is blunt and sometimes says things
        that offend people. She's proud of the fact that she's not
        "politically correct." As her lawyer, what warning do you need
        to give her about the draft contract?

    e.  Barbara plans to urge consulting clients to buy the book in
        bulk. She'd like for them to get a discount when they do. What
        (if anything) does the contract say about that? What changes, if
        any, do you think she should request?

    f.  Barbara is willing to travel to try to drum up book sales,
        giving book talks, signing books, etc. If PP arranges this sort
        of event, who will bear Barbara's travel costs?

    g.  Assume that Barbara hopes to write a sequel, "Turning it Around
        Again." Is she obligated to publish it with PP?

    h.  If Barbara thinks the payments she is getting seem low, what
        rights would she have to verify that they are correct? Keep in
        mind that Barbara is a "numbers person," who is very comfortable
        checking this sort of information on her own. Since you know
        this about her, what change would you suggest in the contract?

    i.  Barbara lives in NY. If she has a dispute with Publishing Press,
        and needs a lawyer's help, what disadvantage does she face?

9.  Barbara needs to decide between Erin and Ed's offer. She knows that
    Erin wants an answer and, if it's "no," she misses that opportunity.

    a.  If she otherwise prefers PP, what concern might she have about
        whether a deal with PP actually is final? Once PP signs their
        draft contract, are they committing to publish her book?

    b.  Continuing with the issue in part "a"\--that is, PP's obligation
        to publish the book--why do you think PP has structured the
        contract in this way? What change should Barbara try to get?
        What argument should she make to justify it?
