Get a head start on finding an agent with Peter's list of the top 9
literary agent red flags:

1\. Not listed on Publisher's Marketplace, the online database of
publishing, which is used by agents/publishers.

It costs \$40 a month to access, but the site is invaluable when you're
searching for the right literary agent.

2\. No website.

Most agents have a presence on the internet. Their professional,
up-to-date website might talk about services, and list their represented
authors.

3\. The agent has been fired often.

How can you tell if an agent has been fired? If the agent has
represented authors, but the authors seem to jump ship after 1--2 books
have been published.

4\. The agent has too many authors.

If an agent has more than 80 authors on a list, they might be overloaded
and don't have time and attention for their authors.

5\. The agent asks for money from you at any point.

Your agent shouldn't charge you anything other than 15% of your book's
advance and royalties.

6\. Your agent lacks a track record.

While a new agent may not have much a track record---and that's
valid---an agent with 20 years of experience without many recent deals
has a serious problem.

7\. The literary agent is based in Omaha.

Around 90% of agents are based in New York City, with the remaining 7%
in Boston or DC, and a small number in Los Angeles and scattered
elsewhere around the country. Why? The publishing houses are in New
York, and the deals are in New York, and it's a relationship-based
business. If an agent is located elsewhere, carefully scrutinize their
authors and sales, and ask how they maintain their connection to the
publishing business. A good agent will understand and appreciate your
questions, and won't get defensive.

8\. They make big promises.

Be wary if they promise you that you're going to have multiple offers
and bids on your book, or promise high advances.

9\. When you ask what their submission strategy might be, they don't
have a clear answer.

A good strategy would involve what editors might be interested, the
state of publishing and knowledge of changes within companies -- such as
publisher mergers and the ascension of smaller publishers such as
Graywolf and Tin House.
