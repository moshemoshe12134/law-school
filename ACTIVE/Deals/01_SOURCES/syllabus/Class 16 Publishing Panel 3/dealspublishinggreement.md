**[AUTHOR PROFIT PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT]{.underline}**

This agreement (this "[Agreement]{.underline}") is made as of MARCH 1,
202X ("[Effective Date]{.underline}") by and among Publisher Press
("Publisher"), and Barbara Author ("Author"), as represented by Alice
Agent ("Alice"). Further, Publisher and Author may be referred to herein
individually as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."

[Whereas]{.smallcaps}, the Author has agreed to write a work of
non-fiction currently and/or tentatively referenced under the working
title, [Turning It Around: How to Turn a Failed Business into a Market
Leader]{.underline}, (final title subject to mutual approval by the
Parties) as more fully described below (the "[Work]{.underline}") for
publication by the Publisher;

[Whereas]{.smallcaps}, Publisher has agreed to publish said Work
according to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

[Now Therefore]{.smallcaps}, for good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties
agree as follows:

1.  [Author Obligations]{.underline}.

    a.  [Delivery.]{.underline} Author shall deliver to Publisher one
        copy of the complete, legible manuscript of the Work (the
        "[Manuscript]{.underline}") in the English language,
        satisfactory to Publisher in length, content and form, no later
        than SEPTEMBER 15, 202X.

    b.  [Permissions.]{.underline} If permission from any third party is
        required for publication of any material contained in the Work
        or for exercise of any of the rights conferred by this
        Agreement, Author shall obtain such permissions at Author's
        expense, in form acceptable to Publisher, and shall deliver such
        permissions to the Publisher as part of the complete Manuscript
        of the Work. Permissions shall cover all territories, rights and
        editions covered by this Agreement.

    c.  [Editing.]{.underline} Author grants Publisher the right to
        employ an editor to prepare the Manuscript, but Author makes no
        guarantees and Publisher imposes no specific expectations or
        penalties regarding the exact length of the Work, which,
        notwithstanding the foregoing, shall be published to the
        standards of professional quality as determined by the
        Publisher. Publisher reserves the right to utilize a
        professional editor for additional edits upon final review. The
        Parties agree that no index will be created for, or included in,
        any version of the Work.

2.  [Publisher Obligations]{.underline}.

    a.  [Artwork.]{.underline} The Parties hereby agree that cover art
        and other designs for inclusion in the Work shall be mutually
        selected. However, mutual agreement is required for final
        approval of cover art. Publisher shall be responsible for
        creating any necessary electronic files of the text and cover of
        the Work. However, should the Author, at their sole expense,
        wish to provide cover art or other designs for inclusion in the
        Work, any third-party designer(s) employed by the Author shall
        first be subject to the approval of the Publisher. Publisher may
        require review of the prospective designer's portfolio, examples
        of previous work, or other application processes prior to
        approval.

    b.  [Distribution.]{.underline} Publisher shall be responsible for
        submitting the Work to various distribution channels of its
        choosing. It is understood between the Parties that the
        Publisher cannot guarantee acceptance of the Work by any
        third-party retailer.

    c.  [Financial Responsibility.]{.underline} Publisher shall assume
        financial responsibility for submission of publication files,
        ISBN fees, and all fees required to maintain the active status
        of the title. Unless otherwise agreed to by Author and
        Publisher, Publisher shall advance and recoup all costs
        associated with the employment of professional designers and
        editors. Such reasonable fees shall be subject to the terms of
        Recoupable Costs as outlined in section 6.a.

    d.  [Promotion.]{.underline} Publisher shall provide web promotion
        on the Publisher's website. Publisher, at its sole discretion,
        may provide additional promotion via other online and
        conventional distribution sources. Publisher shall provide
        typical and customary in-house promotional efforts on behalf of
        the Work.

    e.  [Editing.]{.underline} Publisher, in its sole discretion, may
        edit the Work according to the norms in the publishing industry
        and as it deems necessary; provided that Publisher shall submit
        all edits to the Author for comment and approval.
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any non-habitual
        failure to do so shall not be considered a breach of this
        Agreement. The Author shall not unreasonably withhold their
        approval.

3.  [Grant of Rights]{.underline}.

    a.  [To Publisher]{.underline}.

        i.  Author hereby grants and assigns to the Publisher any and
            all exclusive publishing rights in the Work, in whole or in
            part, throughout the world and in all languages. The
            foregoing license grant includes, but is not limited to, the
            right to print, reproduce, publish, distribute, transmit,
            broadcast, deliver, transfer, market and sell the Work by
            any means now known or hereafter devised, any media
            (including but not limited to hardcover, mass market, trade
            paperback, print-on-demand, and electronic editions),
            formats, editions and derivative adaptations, (including but
            not limited to editions containing advertising), and to
            license others to do so in a manner as set forth in this
            Agreement, for the entirety of the Author's copyrights in
            the Work, in all languages, throughout the world. Author's
            name will appear on the title page, or its equivalent, of
            the Work as the Work's Author.

        ii. Author shall retain all copyrights in the Work and all
            derivative works thereof.

        iii. Author grants Publisher the right, throughout the world and
             in all languages, to exercise the following subsidiary
             rights in the Work or to license such rights upon such
             terms as Publisher deems advisable, for the term set forth
             in section 3.a.i above: book club rights;
             anthology/permission rights; first serial rights (i.e.
             publication before first publication in book form); second
             serial rights (i.e. publication after first publication in
             book form); abridgment/condensation and digest rights;
             large print rights; reprint and special edition rights;
             electronic adaptation rights; audio rights; translation
             rights; and British Commonwealth rights; (collectively,
             "[Subsidiary Rights]{.underline}"). If the Publisher does
             not exploit a specific subsidiary right within one year of
             publication, Author shall be free, on a non-exclusive
             basis, to license them on her own, provided that
             Publisher's right to exercise rights not licensed shall
             continue non-exclusively as well.

        iv. Author grants Publisher the right and obligation to register
            the copyright in the Work with the United States Copyright
            Office in the name of Author pursuant to the United States
            Copyright Act and the Universal Copyright Convention. Both
            parties agree to execute, at any time, all such papers and
            documents as may be advisable, in the Publisher\'s opinion,
            in order to protect, assign, record, renew, or otherwise
            effectuate the rights herein.

    b.  [Author's Reservation of Rights]{.underline}. All rights not
        expressly granted by the Author are reserved to the Author for
        Author's sole use and disposition including but not limited to
        merchandising; motion picture, film, television and dramatic
        adaptation rights; and any other rights not specifically granted
        in subsections of section 3.a above. Author shall not exercise
        or dispose of any reserved rights in such a way as substantially
        and directly destroy, detract from, impair or frustrate the
        value of any rights granted herein. Author shall not publish or
        permit to be published for a period of one year after
        publication of the Work any book or any other form of publishing
        material based substantially and directly on subject matter,
        material, characters or incidents in the Work without the
        written consent of Publisher. This provision shall survive the
        termination of this Agreement.\
        \
        The Publisher acknowledges the Author may intend on writing
        articles, columns, editorials, or give lectures about matters
        that may be encompassed within the general subject matter of the
        Work. Assuming such activities do not substantially destroy,
        detract from, impair or frustrate the value of any of the rights
        granted herein to the Publisher (as solely determined by the
        Publisher), Author shall be free to engage in such activities
        without notice to or consultation with the Publisher, and
        without such activities being deemed a violation of this clause.

    c.  [Option]{.underline}. Author grants the Publisher exclusive
        options to acquire: (i) any full-length work based substantially
        on subject matter, material, characters or incidents in any
        Work, and (ii) the Author's next (i.e., written after the final
        Work) full-length work for publication, on mutually satisfactory
        terms. Publisher is under no obligation to exercise such
        options, and an exercise of one does not create a requirement or
        expectation of exercising the other option. If, after 30 days
        following submission of the proposal of such work to the
        Publisher, Publisher and Author are unable in good faith to
        agree upon terms for publication, the Author shall be free
        thereafter to submit such next work to other publishers,

4.  [Publication]{.underline}. Publisher and Author will work together
    in good faith to make any necessary modifications to the Manuscript.
    The production of a "final Work," delivered to the Publisher shall
    be a condition precedent to the Publisher's obligations to publish
    the Work as agreed herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
    Publisher shall not be obligated to publish the Work if, in the sole
    and absolute judgment of Publisher or its legal counsel, whether
    before or after acceptance thereof, the Work contains libelous or
    obscene material, or its publication may violate the right of
    privacy, common law or statutory copyright, or any other right of
    any person or entity. In such event, Publisher shall be entitled to
    terminate this Agreement. Notwithstanding any request of Author by
    Publisher for change or substantiation, nothing in this Agreement
    shall be deemed to impose upon the Publisher any duty of independent
    investigation of these defects or to relieve the Author of any of
    the obligations assumed by Author hereunder, including, without
    limitation, the ongoing validity of Author's warranties and
    representations which shall apply to all material in the Work,
    whether or not changed at the request of Publisher's legal counsel.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Publisher shall not be obligated
    to publish the Work. In the event that the Publisher chooses not to
    publish the Work, or in the event of the Author's violation of the
    Morals Clause of this Agreement, either before or after the
    publication of the Work, Publisher shall be entitled on demand to
    the return of all unearned remaining monies advanced on behalf of
    publication of the Work, and to terminate this Agreement.\
    \
    The Author shall be deemed to have violated the Morals Clause
    ("Morals Clause") of this Agreement if at any time after the date of
    this Agreement (i) is charged with committing a misdemeanor of moral
    turpitude that is punishable by a prison term of at least 6 months
    or a felony (regardless of the length of prison term associated with
    such offense); or (ii) commits or is accused of committing an act
    involving moral turpitude under federal, state or local law
    (regardless of whether or not such act involving moral turpitude is
    a misdemeanor or felony); or (iii) violates the terms of any parole
    or probation to which such Author is or may become subject; or (iv)
    commits an act of significant public disrepute or becomes the
    subject of a scandal such that Publisher believes, in its sole
    discretion, that the marketability of the Work or Publisher's
    corporate image has been or may be negatively affected.

5.  [Acceptance of Manuscript]{.underline}. Publisher reserves the right
    to reject the Work, for any reason, prior to publication. At the
    Author's option, the Author may make revisions to the Manuscript
    upon Publisher's request. No request for revisions shall be deemed
    to obligate Publisher to accept the final revision or to constitute
    a conditional acceptance thereof. If the Publisher, in its sole
    discretion, determines to submit the Manuscript to a legal review,
    the Author shall cooperate with the Publisher and/or Publisher's
    counsel in such review.\
    \
    Publisher shall notify the Author within sixty (60) days of
    Publisher's receipt of the complete Manuscript as to its
    acceptability or unacceptability. If, at the sole discretion of the
    Publisher, the Publisher determines that the Work is unacceptable,
    the Publisher shall provide the Author with a detailed list of
    changes necessary to render the Manuscript acceptable, and the
    Author shall have a period of time determined by the Publisher in
    which the Author shall make such changes and revise the Work. In the
    event that the Publisher determines at its sole discretion that the
    manuscript remains unacceptable, Publisher may terminate this
    Agreement. Should the Publisher fail to provide feedback regarding
    acceptability of the Manuscript within 60 days of receipt, the
    Manuscript shall automatically be deemed acceptable.

6.  [Royalties; Payment Terms; Audit]{.underline}.

    a.  [Profit Participation.]{.underline} The Parties are entering
        into this Agreement under a profit-participation arrangement.
        Publisher will pay Author fifty percent (50%) of all Profits (as
        defined below) received by Publisher from sales of all versions
        of the Work not specifically named as a Subsidiary Right in
        section 3.a.iii above ("[Author Royalty]{.underline}").
        "[Profits]{.underline}" are to be defined as gross receipts
        received by Publisher from the sale of all versions of the Work,
        less all direct actual and verifiable and reasonable costs and
        expenses associated with (a) any returned items, subject to the
        reserve on returns as set forth below; (b) third party
        distribution fees (c) shipping and handling; (d) postage; (e)
        sales taxes (f) the manufacture, sale, placement, promotion,
        design, vetting, and editing relating to the publication of the
        Work; and (g) any other expenses related to the Work which are
        mutually agreed upon by Publisher and Author ("[Recoupable
        Costs]{.underline}"). Publisher shall not be entitled to include
        as Recoupable Costs any actual or imputed internal costs whether
        denominated overhead or otherwise associated with the Work,
        including but not limited to, employees' salaries, internal
        production services performed by Publisher's in-house staff or
        other plant costs performed in-house by Publisher, unless
        otherwise agreed to by the parties. Publisher may establish a
        reserve for returns equal to or less than the estimated number
        of books sold in relation to the net number of books remaining
        in the marketplace (as determined by gross sales minus returns)
        according to NPD Decisionkey (formerly Nielsen Bookscan). This
        accounting shall be a cumulative total and will update upon each
        quarterly royalty calculation period.

    b.  [Subsidiary Rights Profit Participation.]{.underline} The
        Publisher shall pay the Author fifty percent (50%) of all
        proceeds received by Publisher from the sale or license of any
        right specifically named as a Subsidiary Right in section
        3.a.iii above. Any income resulting from Publisher's sale or
        disposition of Subsidiary Rights hereunder, including any
        advance payments relating to the licensing of such rights
        against the future royalties received from the license or sale
        of such rights, will be included as part of the gross receipts,
        and Author profit participation shall be calculated accordingly.

    c.  [Advance Payment of Author Share of Profit.]{.underline} No
        advance payment on this Work will be made to the Author.

    d.  [Schedule of Reports and/or Payment.]{.underline} Profits shall
        be calculated and Publisher shall make Royalty payments to
        Author twice annually according to the table below. Each payment
        shall be made no later than ninety (90) days after the end of
        the quarter in which the royalties were accrued.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
          **Calendar Period**           **Reports and Payments Due By**
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
         January 1 -- June 30                    September 30

         July 1 -- December 31                     March 31
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

e.  [Statement Detail.]{.underline} Royalty statements shall state the
    Recoupable Costs during the period covered and the net reserve for
    returns being held.

f.  [Examination of Records.]{.underline} Author, upon thirty (30) days
    written notice, may cause to be examined, through an independent
    Certified Public Accountant, the books of the Publisher, insofar as
    they relate to this Agreement at Author\'s own expense at
    Publisher's principal place of business, during normal business
    hours. If errors amounting to five percent (5%) or more of the total
    sums due Author, pursuant to this Agreement, shall be found to
    Author\'s disadvantage, then the cost of the audit shall be borne by
    Publisher. Payment of the amount due shall be made within
    thirty (30) days thereafter.

g.  [Remainder Sales.]{.underline} The Publisher, in its sole
    discretion, but not less than 2 years following the first
    Publication of the Work, may determine that copies of the Work are
    not readily salable at regular prices within a reasonable time and
    may remainder copies of that Work or dispose of such copies as
    surplus at the best price obtainable. Publisher shall first give the
    Author the opportunity to purchase books at or less than the
    remainder price and may also remainder sales in-place (i.e. books
    having already shipped for which credit is given to the bookseller
    in lieu of a full return). Remainder sales or remainder in-place
    sales shall not be subject to profit participation.

7.  [Purchases by Author, Third Parties or Bulk Purchases]{.underline}.

    a.  [Author Purchases.]{.underline} Author may purchase books
        directly from Publisher at a 50% discount from the catalog
        price. If Author purchases more than 100 copies, she shall be
        offered a 60% discount. These purchases will not be subject to
        Profit Participation.

    b.  [Complimentary Copies.]{.underline} Upon request, Publisher
        shall provide Author with a maximum of 40 free copies of the
        Work and Agent 10 copies of the Work.

    c.  [Third-Party Bulk Purchases.]{.underline} Discounts on
        Author-provided bulk third party orders shall be determined on a
        case by case basis according to the number of units to be
        purchased. Any such order that requires a special print run
        shall be subject to a six (6) week lead time and must be paid in
        full, with certified funds, before printing will commence.

8.  [Out-Of-Print and Rights Reversion Provisions\]{.underline}

    a.  [Out-Of-Print.]{.underline} Commencing three (3) years from
        Publisher\'s initial publication of the Work, should the
        Publisher fail to keep the Work in print, and after written
        request from the Author, decline or neglect to bring it back
        into print within six (6) months the Author may terminate this
        Agreement and all rights granted hereunder shall revert to the
        Author. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Work shall
        not be considered "out of print" if the profit accounting for
        the Work remains in a negative state.

    b.  [Financial Threshold.]{.underline} A Work shall be deemed in
        print if at least four hundred dollars (\$400.00) in net
        receipts from any source is received during a twelve (12) month
        period. A Work that is available via e-book or print-on-demand
        that otherwise meets the conditions set forth here (more than 3
        years after initial publication and accruing more than \$400 per
        year in net receipts) shall be deemed in print.

    c.  [Survival of Third-Party Agreements.]{.underline} In the event
        of the termination of this Agreement, any rights reverting to
        the Author shall be subject to (i) all licenses and other grants
        of rights made by Publisher to third parties prior to
        termination, and (ii) to the rights of Publisher to the proceeds
        of such agreements subject to the payment to Author of Author\'s
        share of such proceeds. This section shall survive the
        termination of this Agreement.

    d.  [Excess Physical Inventory.]{.underline} In the event of the
        termination of this Agreement under any provisions within this
        section, and in order for any such termination to proceed,
        Author may be required to purchase any substantial amounts of
        excess printed inventory (as determined by the Publisher) at a
        price to be determined in good faith but not to exceed the
        larger of (i) the actual cost plus shipping of such excess
        inventory, or (ii) the negative amount of the profit accounting
        of the Work.

9.  [Publicity]{.underline}. At Publisher's reasonable request, and
    subject to the Author's availability, the Author shall be available
    for promotion and publicity of the Work and/or to travel on a
    promotional and publicity tour, including national television
    appearances, radio and press interviews and in-store appearance/book
    signings for the Work, at the time of initial or subsequent
    publication of the Work in the United States or elsewhere. All costs
    for such promotional endeavors, unless otherwise arranged between
    the Author and Publisher, shall be advanced by the Publisher and
    will be considered a Recoupable Cost subject to the terms of section
    6.a above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Publisher shall have the
    final right of approval over the release date of the Work, and the
    marketing, publicity, and promotion of the Work. This includes but
    is not limited to press releases and book events. Author agrees
    Publisher may use Author\'s name, approved photograph, and approved
    biography in connection with promotion and advertising of the Work
    and in exploiting the rights herein granted to Publisher. Author may
    post up to 10% of the content of the Work as well as the
    cover/jacket art of the Work on Author's website(s) to advertise and
    promote the Work. If Publisher requests Author to travel, Publisher
    shall pay for reasonable costs of travel, hotel and meals subject to
    the terms of Recoupable Costs as outlined in section 6.a above.

10. [Representations and Warranties; Prior Agreements]{.underline}.
    Author represents and warrants that (a) the Work is original, except
    where Author obtains permissions, in advance, acceptable to
    Publisher to include non-original (to the Author) contributions, (b)
    the Work will not violate any statutory or other copyright or any
    other right of third parties (including right of privacy), or be
    libelous or obscene, or in any way illegal and that any recipe,
    formula or instruction contained in any Work is not injurious to the
    user, (c) Author has used his or her best efforts to independently
    verify all statements of fact or purported fact included in the
    Work, and Author acknowledges that Publisher will not undertake any
    efforts to verify the accuracy or truthfulness of such statements
    and (d) the Author has the authority to enter into this Agreement.
    These warranties shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

11. [Indemnification]{.underline}.

    a.  [Indemnification.]{.underline} Each Party shall indemnify,
        defend and hold harmless the other Party, their parent and
        affiliates, and their respective successors and permitted
        assigns, and their directors, officers, agents and employees,
        heirs, executors, and administrators, from and against any
        demands, cause of actions, damages, including punitive damages,
        liabilities, costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
        reasonable attorney\'s fees, (collectively,
        "[Liabilities]{.underline}") based upon or in connection
        with (a) any actual or alleged breach of that Party's
        representations, warranties and obligations hereunder;
        and/or (b) that Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct
        in connection with this Agreement; and/or (c) except as
        otherwise provided herein, that Party's obligations to third

        termination of this Agreement.

    b.  [Insurance.]{.underline} Author shall be solely responsible, at
        their discretion, to obtain insurance to insure itself from any
        liabilities and warranties contained herein. To the extent that
        Publisher acquires or maintains at its own expense a policy of
        multimedia liability and/or errors and omissions insurance,
        Publisher shall extend coverage to the Author if provided for by
        such policy. However, no coverage will be available for Author
        for claims based on or directly or indirectly arising out of or
        resulting from the breach of any representation, warranty or
        guarantee made by Author in this Agreement.
