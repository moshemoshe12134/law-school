1\. *Costs of Acquiring Information*

During the negotiation, the buyer and seller will face different costs
of information acquisition for two important reasons. First, as a simple
result of its prior operation of the business, the seller will already
have large amounts of information concerning the business that the buyer
does not have, but would like to acquire. Second, there usually will be
information that neither party has, but that one or both would like and
which one or the other can acquire more cheaply. The question is then
how both of these situations are dealt with in the acquisition agreement
so as to reduce the informational differences between the parties at the
lowest possible cost.

At first, one might wonder why any cooperative effort is necessary.
Assuming that the seller did not affirmatively block the buyer's efforts
to acquire the information the buyer wanted (and the seller already
had), nothing would prevent the buyer from independently acquiring the
desired information. Similarly, assuming both parties had the
opportunity to acquire the desired new information, nothing would
prevent both parties from independently acquiring it.

Actually, however, it is in the seller's best interest to make the
information that the seller already has available to the buyer as
cheaply as possible. Suppose the seller refused to assist the buyer in
securing a particular piece of information that the seller already had.
If the information could have either a positive or negative value on the
buyer's evaluation of the worth of the business, a rational buyer would
infer from the seller's refusal to cooperate that the information must
be unfavorable. Thus, the seller has little incentive to withhold the
information.^7^[^1] Indeed, the same result would follow even if the
information in question would not alter the buyer's estimate of the
value of the business, but only increase the certainty with which that
estimate was held.^7^[^2] Once we have established that the seller wants
the buyer to have the information, the only issue that remains is which
party can produce it most cheaply. The total price the buyer will pay
for the business is the sum of the amount to be paid to the seller and
the transaction costs incurred by the buyer in effecting the
transaction. To the extent that the buyer's information costs are
reduced, there simply is more left over for division between the buyer
and seller.

Precisely the same analysis holds for information that neither party has
yet acquired. The seller could refuse to cooperate with the buyer in its
acquisition. To do so, however, would merely increase the information
costs associated with the transaction to the detriment of both parties.

There is thus an incentive for the parties to cooperate both to reduce
informational asymmetries between them and to reduce the costs of
acquiring information either believes necessary for the transaction. As
a result, we would expect an acquisition agreement to contain provisions
for three kinds of cooperative behavior concerning information
acquisition costs. First, the agreement would facilitate the transfer of
information the seller already has to the buyer. Second, the agreement
would allocate the responsibility of producing information that neither
the seller nor the buyer already has to the party who can acquire it
most cheaply, thereby both avoiding duplication of costs and minimizing
those that must be incurred. Finally, the agreement would try to control
overspending on information acquisition by identifying not only the type
of information that should be acquired, but also how much should be
spent on its acquisition.

a\. *Facilitating the Transfer of Information to the Buyer*

In the course of negotiating an acquisition, there is an obvious and
important information asymmetry between the buyer and the seller. The
buyer will have expended substantial effort in selecting the seller from
among the number of potential acquisitions considered at a preliminary
stage^7^[^3] and, in doing so, may well have gathered all the available
public information concerning the seller. Nonetheless, the seller will
continue to know substantially more than the buyer about the business.
Much detailed information about the business, of interest to a buyer but
not, perhaps, to the securities markets generally, will not have been
previously disclosed by the seller.^7^[^4]

It is in the seller's interest, not just in the buyer's, to reduce this
asymmetry. If the seller's private information is not otherwise
available to the buyer at all, the buyer must assume that the
undisclosed information reflects unfavorably on the value of the buyer's
business, an assumption that will be reflected to the seller's
disadvantage in the price the buyer offers. Alternatively, even if the
information could be gathered by the buyer (a gambit familiar to
business lawyers is the seller's statement that it will open all its
facilities to the buyer, that the buyer is welcome to come out and "kick
the tires," but that there will be no representations and warranties),
it will be considerably cheaper for the seller, whose marginal costs of
production are very low,^7^[^5] to provide the information than for the
buyer to produce it alone. From the buyer's perspective, the cost of
acquiring information is part of its overall acquisition cost; amounts
spent on information reduce the amount left over for the seller.

This analysis, it seems to me, accounts for the quite detailed picture
of the seller's business that the standard set of representations and
warranties presents. Among other facts, the identity, location and
condition of the assets of the business are described;^7^[^6] the nature
and extent of liabilities are specified;^7^[^7] and the character of
employee relationships\--from senior management to production
employees\--is described.^7^[^8] This is information that the buyer
wants and the seller already has; provision by the seller minimizes its
acquisition costs to the benefit of both parties.

What remains puzzling, however, it is the apparent failure by both
business lawyers and clients to recognize that the negotiation of
representations and warranties, at least from the perspective of
information acquisition costs, presents the occasion for cooperative
rather than distributive bargaining.^7^[^9] Reducing the cost of
acquiring information needed by either party makes both better off. Yet
practitioners report that the negotiation of representations and
warranties is the most time-consuming aspect of the transaction,^8^[^10]
it is termed "a nit-picker's delight, a forum for expending prodigious
amounts of energy in debating the merits of what sometimes seem to be
relatively insignificant items."^8^[^11] And it is not merely lawyers
who are seduced by the prospect of combat; sellers also express
repugnance for a "three pound acquisition agreement"^8^[^12] whose
weight and density owe much to the detail of the article titled
"Representations and Warranties of Seller." As a result, seller's
lawyers are instructed to negotiate ferociously to keep the
document\--especially the representations and warranties short.
Increased information costs needlessly result. Indeed, a business
lawyer's inability to explain the actual function of these provisions
can often cause the buyer incorrectly to attribute the document's length
to its own lawyer's preference for verbosity and unnecessary complexity.
This failure to explain can prevent recognition of value-creating
activity even when it occurs.^8^[^13]

b\. *Facilitating the Production of Previously Nonexistent Information*

A similar analysis applies when the buyer needs information that the
seller has not already produced. For example, the buyer may desire
information about aspects of the seller's operation that bear on the
opportunity for synergy between its own business and that of the seller
and that, prior to the negotiation, the seller had no reason to create.
Alternatively, the buyer may be interested in the impact of the
transaction itself on the seller's business; whether the seller's
contracts can be assigned or assumed; whether, for example, the
transaction would accelerate the seller's obligations. Like the
situation in which the buyer has already produced the information
desired by the seller, the only issue here should be to minimize the
acquisition cost of the information in question.

While the analysis is similar to the situation in which the seller had
previously produced the information, the result of the analysis is
somewhat different. Not only will the seller not always be the
least-cost information producer, but there will also be a substantial
role for third-party information producers. Returning to the synergy
example, a determination of the potential for gain from the combination
of the two businesses requires information about both. The particular
character of the businesses, as well as the skills of their managers,
will determine whether such a study is better undertaken by the seller,
which knows its own business but will be required to learn about the
buyer's business, or by the buyer, which knows about its own business
and is in the process of learning about the seller's.^8^[^14]

The more interesting analysis concerns the potential role for
third-party information producers. This can be seen most clearly with
respect to information concerning the impact of the transaction itself
on the seller's business. As between the buyer and the seller, the
seller will usually be the least-cost producer of information concerning
the impact of the transaction on, for example, the seller's existing
contracts. Although there is no reason to expect that either party
routinely will have an advantage in interpreting the contracts, it is
predictable that the seller can more cheaply assemble the facts on which
the interpretation will be based. The real issue, however, is not
whether the seller is the lower-cost producer out of a group of
candidates artificially limited to the seller and buyer. Rather, the
group of candidates must be expanded to include third parties.

The impact of including third-party information production in our
analysis can be seen by examining the specialized information production
role for lawyers in acquisition transactions. Even with respect to the
production of information concerning the seller's assets and
liabilities, the area where our prior analysis demonstrated the seller's
prominence as an information producer, there remains a clear need for a
specialized third party. Production of certain information concerning
the character of the seller's assets and liabilities simply requires
legal analysis. For example, the seller will know whether it has been
cited for violation of environmental or health and safety legislation in
the past, but it may require legal analysis to determine whether
continued operation of the seller's business likely will result in
future prosecution.

The need for third-party assistance is even more apparent with respect
to information about the impact of the transaction itself on the
seller's business. Again, however, much of the information requires
legal analysis; there exists a specialized information-production role
for third parties. For example, it will be important to know whether
existing contracts are assignable or assumable: The continued validity
of the seller's leasehold interests will depend on whether a change in
the control of the seller operates\--as a matter of law or because of
the specific terms of the lease\--as an assignment of the
leasehold;^8^[^15] and the status of the seller's existing liabilities,
such as its outstanding debt, will depend on whether the transaction can
be undertaken without the creditor's consent.^8^[^16]

In both cases, the seller's lawyer appears to be the lowest-cost
producer of such information.^8^[^17] As a result, I would expect
typical acquisition agreements to assign lawyers this
information-production role.^8^[^18] And it is from this perspective
that important elements of the common requirement of an "Opinion of
Counsel for the Seller" are best understood.

Any significant acquisition agreement requires, as a condition to the
buyer's obligation to complete the transaction, that the buyer receive
an opinion of seller's counsel with respect to a substantial number of
items.^8^[^19] Consistent with my analysis, most of the matters on which
legal opinions are required reflect the superiority of the seller's
lawyer as an information producer. For example, determination of the
seller's proper organization and continued good standing under state
law, the appropriate authorization of the transaction by seller, the
existence of litigation against the seller, the impact of the
transaction on the seller's contracts and commitments, and the extent to
which the current operation of the seller's business violates any law or
regulation, represent the production of information which neither the
buyer nor the seller previously had, by a third party\--the lawyer\--who
is the least-cost producer.^9^[^20]

Just as was the case in our examination of the function of
representations and warranties, this focus on the information-production
role for lawyers'opinions also provides a non-adversarial approach to
resolving the conflict over their content. Because reducing the cost of
information necessary to the correct pricing of the transaction is
beneficial to both buyer and seller, determination of the matters to be
covered by the opinion of counsel for seller^9^[^21] should be in large
measure a cooperative, rather than a competitive, opportunity. Debate
over the scope of the opinion, then, should focus explicitly on the cost
of producing the information. For example, where a privately owned
business is being sold, the seller often retains special counsel to
handle the acquisition transaction, either because the company has had
no regular counsel prior to the transaction, or because its regular
counsel is not experienced in acquisition transactions. In this
situation, recognition of the informational basis of the subject matter
usually covered by legal opinions not only suggests that a specialized
third-party producer is appropriate, but also provides guidance about
*whose* third party should actually do the production.

From this perspective, seller's counsel typically will be the least-cost
producer of the information in question. Past experience with the seller
will eliminate the need for much factual investigation that would be
necessary for someone who lacked a prior professional relation to the
seller. Similarly, seller's counsel may well have been directly involved
in some of the matters of concern\--such as the issuance of the
securities which are the subject of an opinion concerning the seller's
capitalization, or the negotiation of the lease which is the subject of
an opinion concerning the impact of the transaction on the seller's
obligations. Where the seller has retained special counsel for the
transaction, however, the production-cost advantage in favor of seller's
counsel will be substantially reduced, especially with respect to past
matters. In those cases, focus on the cost of information production
provides a method for cooperative resolution of the frequently
contentious issue of the scope of the opinion.^9^[^22]

c\. *Controls Over What Information to Look for and How Hard to Try*

Emphasis on the information-production role of the seller's
representations and warranties and the opinion of counsel for the seller
leads to the conclusion that determination of the least-cost information
producer provides a cooperative focus for negotiating the content of
those provisions. The same emphasis on information production also
raises a related question. The demand for information, as for any other
good, is more or less price elastic. Information production is costly
even for the most efficient producer, and the higher the cost, the less
the parties will choose to produce. Thus, some fine tuning of the
assignment of information-production roles would seem to be necessary.
We would expect some specific limits on the kind of information required
to be produced. And we would also expect some specific limits on how
much should be spent even for information whose production is desired.

Examination of an acquisition agreement from this perspective identifies
provisions which impose precisely these kinds of controls. Moreover,
explicit recognition of the function of these provisions, as with our
analysis of representations and warranties and opinions of counsel, can
facilitate the negotiation of what have traditionally been quite
difficult issues.

Consider first the question of limiting the type of information that
must be produced in light of the cost of production. To put the problem
in a context, we can focus on the standard representation concerning the
seller's existing contracts. The buyer's initial draft typically will
require the seller to represent than an attached schedule lists "all
agreements, contracts, leases, and other commitments to which the seller
is a party or by which any of its property is bound." In fact, it is
quite unlikely that the buyer really wants the seller to incur the costs
of producing all the information specified. In a business of any
significant size, there will be a large number of small contracts\--for
office plant care, coffee service, addressographs, and the like\--the
central collection and presentation of which would entail substantial
cost. Moreover, to the extent these contracts are all in the normal
course of the seller's business, the information may have little bearing
on the pricing of the transaction. As a result, it would be beneficial
to both parties to limit the scope of the seller's search.

It is from this perspective that the function of certain common
qualifications of the representations and warranties of the seller are
best understood. The expected response of a seller to a representation
as to existing contracts of the breadth of those mentioned would be to
qualify the scope of the information to be produced: to limit the
obligation to only *material* contracts.^9^[^23] If the contracts
themselves are not important, then there is no reason to incur the cost
of producing information about them. Variations on the theme include
qualifications based on the dollar value of the contracts,^9^[^24] or on
the relationship of the contracts to "the ordinary course of
business."^9^[^25]

A second common form of qualifications\--a limit on the information
costs to be incurred\-- is best understood as an instruction concerning
how hard to look for information whose subject matter cannot be excluded
as unimportant ahead of time. Here the idea is to qualify not the object
of the inquiry, but the diligence of the search.^9^[^26] Consider, for
example, the common representation concerning the absence of defaults
under disclosed contracts.^9^[^27] While it might involve little cost to
determine whether the seller, as lessee, has defaulted under a lease, it
may well be quite expensive to determine whether the lessor is in
default. In that situation, the buyer might consider it sufficient to be
told everything that the seller had thought appropriate to find out for
its own purposes, without regard to the acquisition, but not to require
further investigation.

This type of qualification, limiting the representation to information
the seller already has and requiring no further search, is the domain of
the familiar "knowledge" qualification. In form, the representation
concerning the existence of breaches is qualified by the phrase "to
seller's knowledge." In function, the qualification serves to limit the
scope of the seller's search to information already within its
possession; no new information need be sought.^9^[^28]

Recognizing the function of the knowledge of qualification also raises
another question concerning the variation in form that the qualification
takes in typical acquisition agreements. In fact, the knowledge
qualification\--the limit on how hard the seller must search for
information\--comes in a variety of forms. Often within the same
agreement one will see all of the following variations:

"to seller's knowledge";

"to the best of seller's knowledge";

"to the best of seller's knowledge and after diligent investigation."

What seems to be at work, at least implicitly, is the creation of a
hierarchy of search effort that must be undertaken with respect to
information of different levels of importance.^9^[^29]

This result is perfectly consistent with a view of the business lawyer
as a transaction cost engineer, and with a view of representations and
warranties as a means of producing the information necessary to pricing
the transaction at the lowest cost. However, it also raises the question
of whether implicit recognition of the information-cost function of
these qualifications might not facilitate the design of more effective
cost reduction techniques. Although this is not the occasion to detail
the changes in the form of acquisition agreements that might result from
conscious attention to issues of information cost, it seems quite clear
that once we understand more precisely what it is we are about, we
should be able to do a more effective job.

Consider, for example, the qualifications that we have just discussed
concerning how hard the seller must look. Given our understanding of
their purpose, the problem of limiting the scope of the seller's
investigation might be better approached explicitly, rather than
implicitly through a variety of undefined adjectives. If, for example,
the concern is whether the lessor of a real estate lease, under which
the seller is lessee, has breached the lease, why not specify the actual
investigation the seller should make? Do we want the seller merely to
inspect the premises to insure that the lessor's maintenance obligations
have been satisfied? Do we want the seller to go directly to the lessor
to secure a statement by the lessor as to the lessor's satisfaction of
its obligations?^10^[^30] Different levels of cost obviously are
associated with the different inquiries; specificity about the desired
level of cost, however, should allow further minimization of information
costs. To make the point in a slightly different way, is it possible to
say with any assurance which of the forms of qualification listed above
imposes an obligation to inspect the premises, but no obligation to
inquire directly of the lessor?

[^1]: ^71^See Grossman*, The Informational Role of Warranties and
    Private Disclosure About Product Quality*, 24 J.L. & *Econ.* 461,
    479 (1981); Grossman & Hart, *Disclosure Laws and Takeover Bids*, 35
    *J. Fin*. 323 (1980). The analysis becomes more complicated,
    however, if disclosure imposes other kinds of costs on the seller
    \-- for example, disclosure of some accounting data might provide to
    competitors insights into the seller's future strategy, and
    disclosure of product information might allow competitors more
    easily to duplicate the seller's product. Where there are such
    proprietary costs to disclosure, the signal conveyed by
    nondisclosure becomes "noisy": Non-disclosure may mean that the
    information kept private is negative; less ominously, it may mean
    that disclosure of the information would be costly. The result would
    be an equilibrium amount of non-disclosure. R. Verrecchia,
    *Discretionary Disclosure*, Working Paper No. 101, Center for
    Research in Security Prices (August 1983) (unpublished manuscript on
    file with author). While Verrecchia's argument has important
    insights for the issue of voluntary disclosure in the setting of
    organized securities markets, it seems to me much less relevant in
    the acquisition setting. There the opportunity for face-to-face
    bargaining allows the use of techniques such as confidentiality
    agreements, *see* *Business Acquisitions*, *supra note* 45, at
    399-401 (form of confidentiality agreement), that can substantially
    reduce such proprietary disclosure costs and, as a result, reduce
    any noise associated with failure to disclose.

[^2]: ^72^In other words, the new information would not alter the mean
    estimate of value but would reduce the variance associated with the
    distribution of possible values.

[^3]: ^73^For the purpose of search costs in the acquisition content,
    see Easterbrook & Fischel, *Auctions and Sunk Costs in Tender
    Offers*, 35 *Stan. L. Rev.* 1 (1982); Gilson, *Seeking Competitive
    Bids Versus Pure Passivity in Tender Offer Defense*, 35 *Stan. L.
    Rev.* 51 (1982).

[^4]: ^74^For example, the potential for synergy between the seller's
    business and that of a potential buyer will become of interest to
    the market only at the point where the possibility of the
    acquisition comes to the market's attention.

[^5]: ^75^The costs are still *not* zero. While the information exists,
    there are still costs associated with finding out where within the
    seller's organization the information is located, putting it in a
    form that is useful to the buyer, and verifying it. As a result,
    even some information that already exists may not be worthwhile to
    locate and transmit. *See infra* pp. 278-80 (limitations on for
    what, and how hard, to look). Additionally, there will be situations
    where a third party will be able to produce the information even
    more cheaply than the seller. *See infra* pp. 274-76 (lawyer's
    opinions). This qualification, however, does not alter the absence
    of conflict between the parties.

[^6]: ^76^*See, e.g, Drafting Agreements*, *supra* note 45, at 81-94
    (warranties disclosing identity and condition of real property and
    leases; compliance with zoning; composition, condition, and
    marketability of inventory; personal property and condition;
    accounts receivable and collectability; trade names, trademarks, and
    copyrights; patent and patent rights; trade secrets; insurance
    policies; and employment contracts).

    bargaining, bonus, profit-sharing, or fringe benefit agreements).

[^9]: ^79^I mean to put off for the moment the question of what happens
    when one of the seller's representations and warranties turns out to
    be incorrect. I will take up the issue of indemnification for breach
    of warranty in connection with the verification function. *See
    infra* pp. 281-87.

[^12]: ^82^ *Id.* at 233.

[^13]: ^83^ Freund, as usual is not guilty of this failure. His
    explanation for the phenomenon differs from mine, however. *See* J.
    Freund, *supra* note 45, at 230-34.

[^14]: ^84^ The least-cost producer typically will be the buyer.
    Although the buyer will already know something about the seller, the
    seller will have had little reason to learn about the buyer's
    business prior to initiation of negotiations. As a result, the
    amount that still must be learned about the other party's business
    in order to evaluate the potential for synergy is likely to be
    smaller for the buyer than for the seller. This yields a prediction
    that should be subject to empirical testing. If my hypothesis is
    correct, I would expect to find few representations and warranties
    by the seller that could be understood to speak to conditions
    directly related to the manner in which the two entities could be
    combined. The *absence* of a representation by the seller, of
    course, leaves the information-production function with the buyer.

[^15]: ^85^ For example, would a general clause prohibiting assignment
    of a lease by a corporate tenant prohibit the sale of all the
    tenant's stock, or a merger of the tenant, or even the dissolution
    of the tenant and the succession to the tenancy by the tenant's
    shareholders? *See* 1 M. *Friedman, Friedman on Leases* 244-52 (2d
    ed. 1983).

[^16]: ^86^ Loan agreements typically limit a debtor's freedom to merge
    or sell its assets without the creditor's consent. *See*
    *Commentarie*s, *supra* note 47. From the creditor's perspective,
    such protection is critical. The interest rate charged a debtor
    depends on the risk associated with the debtor's business. If the
    business becomes substantially more risky after the credit is
    extended, the interest rate charged, in effect, is reduced. The
    consent requirement is designed to prevent a creditor from altering
    the risk of its business after the fact through acquiring, or being
    acquired by, a company with a riskier business. *See* Smith &
    Warner, *supra* note 47, at 126-27.

[^17]: ^87^ The seller's lawyer will likely have been involved in the
    original preparation of the documents and, as a result, will have
    much better information concerning their contents and the context in
    which they were negotiated.

    For present purposes, there is no need to distinguish between
    outside counsel and lawyers employed full time by the seller. The
    issue of whether a particular staff function, like legal work,
    should be handled inside the firm or acquired in market transactions
    from outside providers can issue of vertical integration that does
    not bear on the question of whether lawyers\--inside or
    outside\--serve a valuable function. The distinction will take on
    importance, however, with respect to the verification function. *See
    infra* pp. 289-93.

[^18]: ^88^ The information-production role for lawyers described in the
    text is not in itself sufficient to respond to my overall question
    of whether business lawyers can create value. The larger question,
    it will be recalled, focused on whether business lawyers had the
    potential to create value even in those situations where there is no
    traditionally "legal" role. Because the information-production role
    involves interpreting government regulations and construing the
    meaning of contracts\--functions which are not responsive to the
    more difficult question with which I am especially concerned\--they
    do not provide an easy way out.

[^19]: ^89^ There is a substantial practical literature. *See* *A.
    Jacobs, Opinion Letters in Securities Matters: Text\--Clauses\--
    Law* (1983); Babb, Barnes, Gordon & Kjellenberg, *Legal Opinions to
    Third Parties in Corporate Transactions*, 32 *Bus. Law* 553 (1977);
    Bermant, *The Role of the Opinion of Counsel\--A Tentative
    Reevaluation*, 49 *Cal. St.* B.J. 132 (1974); Committee on
    Corporations of the Business Law Section of the State Bar of
    California, *Report of the Committee on Corporations Regarding Legal

    Legal Opinions on Commercial Transactions, N.Y. County Lawyers'
    Association, *Legal Opinions to Third Parties: An Easier Path*, 34.
    *Bus. Law*. 1891 (1979).

[^20]: ^90^ The opinion of counsel also serves an important verification
    function. *See infra* pp. 290-93.

[^21]: ^91^ Typically there will be occasions that call for an opinion
    of buyer's counsel as well. Consistent with an information-cost
    analysis, the scope of the opinion of buyer's counsel increases as
    information about the buyer becomes important to pricing the
    transaction. This would be the case, for example, where the two
    parties are so close in size that the transaction is really a
    merger, or where the consideration to be given by the seller is the
    buyer's stock. In virtually all transactions, the opinion of the
    buyer's counsel will be required with respect to the impact of the
    transaction itself, such as proper authorization of the transaction
    by the buyer.

[^22]: ^92^ The role of information-producer also may be played by
    another third-party specialist: the public accountant. The
    accountant typically also renders an opinion concerning the
    transaction\--the cold comfort letter\--and easily can be imagined
    having an information-production role. The common presence of an
    internal accounting staff within the seller, however, persuades me
    that the transactional function of the public accountant is one of
    verification. *See infra* pp.290-93. Whether or not there is also an
    information-production role for the public accountant depends on the
    comparative information-production costs of the public accountant
    and the seller's internal accounting staff.

[^26]: ^96^ This analysis, and that concerning the object of the
    inquiry, applies as well to the role of third-party information
    producers.

[^27]: ^97^ *See, e.g.,* *Drafting Agreements*, *supra* note 45, at 94
    ("There is no default or event that with notice or lapse of time, or
    both, would constitute a default by any party to any of these
    agreements.")

[^28]: ^98^James Freund identifies another function for representations
    and warranties that suggests a different role for the knowledge
    qualification. Freund points out that an unqualified representation
    serves, in effect, as an insurance policy. Thus, an unqualified
    representation may be made even though the seller is aware of a
    possibility that the representation is incorrect, because the
    parties have determined that the seller should bear that risk and
    the absolute representation serves to allocate that risk to the
    seller. *J. Freund*, *supra* note 45, at 247-48. From an information
    perspective, however, Freund's point is part of an approach to
    dealing with the problem of information asymmetry. Suppose both the
    buyer and the seller are aware that certain of seller's trade
    secrets may be subject to a misappropriation claim, and that such a
    claim, if successful, would reduce the value of the seller's
    business by \$1,000,000. It would hardly be surprising if the buyer
    and the seller had different estimates of the probability of a
    successful misappropriation claim; after all, the seller has vastly
    more information concerning the circumstances in which the trade
    secrets were developed than does the buyer. Suppose further that the
    buyer, based on its information, estimates the probability of
    liability at .5, and therefore argues that the purchase price should
    be reduced by \$500,000. The seller, however, based on its
    information, estimates the probability at only .15, which would
    justify only a \$150,000 reduction in the purchase price. The effect
    of the seller's making an unqualified warranty concerning ownership
    of trade secrets is to allocate the risk of liability to the seller,
    the party with the best information and, therefore, the party best
    able to price the risk. From the buyer's perspective, the risk has
    been eliminated. From the seller's perspective, \$350,000 has been
    gained: The expected value of the purchase price\--total price less
    expected liability\--is \$350,000 higher than if the buyer's
    estimate was used. Thus, unqualified representations and warranties
    can serve, as Freund perceptively suggests, as insurance policies.
    However, the determination of which party should be the insurer
    turns on the determination of which party has better information
    and, as a result, is better able to price the risk.

[^29]: ^99^ This proposition\--that different forms of qualification
    reflect the different levels of intended search effort\--also may be
    subject to empirical evaluation. If one of the parties to an
    acquisition agreement is a reporting company under the Securities
    Exchange Act, its Form 10K Annual Report typically would contain the
    agreement as an exhibit. Thus, one could gather a substantial sample
    of acquisition agreements to analyze whether there was a pattern to
    the types of information subject to qualification and to the form of
    qualification used.

[^30]: ^100^ If information is too costly to produce, the issue shifts
    to who is best able to price and bear the risk, again
    information-cost issues.
