**Discussion Questions \# 17: Motion Pictures:**

**Is Vertical Integration Anticompetitive? (Panel 1)**

1.  A trust dominated the motion picture industry in its early years
    until about 1915. (The trust was dissolved in 1917.)

    a.  Why was it sometimes called the "Edison trust"?

    b.  What was the source of the trust's leverage? What was the key
        source of value in the industry in those early years?

    c.  The trust prohibited the identification of actors and actresses
        in those early years. Why?

    d.  What other constraint did it impose on movies being made at the
        time? Why? Was this assessment about the potential audience for
        motion pictures more plausible then than it is now?

    e.  The trust was based in New York and on the east coast of the
        U.S. Where is the film industry in the U.S. located? Is there
        any causal connection here?

2.  Three Phases in Producing a Motion Picture

    a.  What is "production"?

    b.  What is "distribution"?

    c.  What is "exhibition"?

3.  The "Studio Era"

    a.  Between 1915 and 1948, movies were made in what is called the
        "studio era." What was its defining feature?

    b.  What event marked the end of the studio era?

    c.  What is "vertical integration"?

4.  *Paramount*

a.  There are three groups of defendants. How does the first group (the
    only one charged on this issue of the case) differ from the other
    two?

b.  What did the government allege about this group of defendants?

c.  According to the district court, did any of the defendants
    individually wield enough market power to have a national monopoly?
    Was this finding important to the Supreme Court ("the Court")?

d.  What percentage of all theaters in the U.S. did the defendants
    control? Does that seem like enough to dictate prices and other
    terms?

e.  The Court observes that the defendants had more market power in a
    subset of the exhibition market. Which subset was that? Did the
    Court consider this important?

f.  Is there competition within this subset of theaters?

g.  Is vertical integration illegal per se? What is the Court's test for
    determining when it violates the antitrust laws?

h.  What kind of evidence does the Court invoke? Is the Court reviewing
    evidence of *the effects* of the defendants' market power?

i.  Had the district court held that the defendants had to sell their
    theaters? Did the Supreme Court affirm the district court on this
    issue?

j.  The Court says that courts should consider the defendants' intent,
    and it also says that monopoly power can be illegal "though it
    remains unexercised." Is there any tension between these two
    assertions?

k.  Would you say that the Court's analysis is economically
    sophisticated? For example, how does it compare with Andrew
    Hanssen's analysis in the article assigned for today?

l.  The U.S. government has a track record of bringing antitrust actions
    against companies that are on the verge of confronting a formidable
    new competitor (e.g., IBM and Microsoft). What new entertainment
    platform was emerging in the late 1940s in the U.S.?

5.  Can Vertical Integration Be Anti-competitive?

    a.  Why might it be in the interest of movie producers to limit the
        number of movies that are made?

    b.  Assume that the profit-maximizing number of new movies released
        each year is 250, that there are five movie production
        companies, and that you are the head of one of them. Assume also
        (counterfactually) that the law does not prevent you from
        striking a deal with the other four CEOs, so that each of you
        commit to make only 50 movies each year, keeping the total
        at 250. If the other four CEOs honor the agreement, is it better
        for you also to honor it? If you have the ability to "cheat" and
        secretly make and sell another five movies, would it be in your
        interest to do so?

    c.  Given your answer to "c," how easy or hard is it to strike an
        agreement limiting supply? How important is the ability to
        monitor whether everyone is keeping the agreement? How important
        is the ability to enforce the agreement?

    d.  If each studio owns some movie theaters and no one else does--so
        the five studios control all the movie theaters in your
        market--does that make it easier or harder for the five of you
        to monitor and enforce an agreement limiting the number of
        movies that are made?

    e.  True or false: By owning movie theaters, studios have the
        ability to prevent new studios (who don't own theaters) from
        displaying their movies. This control over exhibition can give
        them added market power in production and distribution.

    f.  Same facts as in "b," but there is a sixth "independent" studio,
        which does not own any theaters. It produces a movie that you
        think could be a big draw, which would fill your theaters if you
        agree to exhibit it. On the one hand, what incentive do you have
        to refuse to exhibit it? On the other hand, what incentive do
        you have to agree to exhibit it?

    g.  Two prominent economists, Oliver Hart and Jean Tirole, wrote an
        article called "Vertical Integration and Market Forfeiture"
        (which is not assigned for class). They say the following: "Few
        people would disagree that horizontal mergers have the potential
        to restrict output and raise consumer prices." Do you know what
        a "horizontal merger" is? Why do they say that it has this
        potential?

    h.  Hart and Tirole go on to say that there is less agreement about
        whether vertical mergers also have the potential to restrict
        output and raise consumer prices "because the merger of an
        upstream and downstream firm, each of which controls, say, 10%
        of its market, does not change market shares: other firms
        continue to control 90% of each market." Please explain this
        statement.

    i.  Hart & Tirole argue, though, that vertical integration actually
        can help a firm with market power in one market (such as
        theaters) to leverage that power in another market (such as
        movie production). They say that the key to this leverage across
        markets, which is known as "market forfeiture, is that
        integration allows the upstream and downstream firms, once they
        merge, to share profits more effectively. In contrast, if they
        remain independent, they could "divert money and misrepresent
        profits." Please explain this statement.

    j.  During the studio era, actors were salaried employees at
        studios--much as auto workers are salaried employes at car
        companies and musicians are salaried employees at orchestras.
        Someone on salary at Warner would not be in movies made by Fox,
        and vice versa. After the old system ended, this practice ended
        with it. Actors were hired to do a particular movie, and they
        stopped working exclusively for a single studio. The pay of star
        talent increased significantly. Could the lower salaries under
        the studio system have been caused by the anticompetitive
        effects of vertical integration?
