Supreme Court of the United States

February 9-11, 1948, Argued ; May 3, 1948, Decided

No. 79

**Syllabus**

The United States sued to restrain violations of §§ 1 and 2 of the
Sherman Act by** \[\*\*\*\*2\] ** (1) five corporations which produce
motion pictures and their respective subsidiaries or affiliates which
distribute and exhibit films and own or control theatres, (2) two
corporations which produce motion pictures and their subsidiaries which
distribute films, and (3) one corporation engaged only in the
distribution of motion pictures. The complaint charged that the first
group of defendants conspired to and did restrain and monopolize
interstate trade in the exhibition of motion pictures in most of the
larger cities of the country and that their combination of producing,
distributing and exhibiting motion pictures violated §§ 1 and 2 of the
Act. It also charged that all of the defendants, as distributors,
conspired to and did restrain and monopolize interstate trade in the
distribution and exhibition of films. After a trial, the District Court
granted an injunction and other relief. *Held*:

. . .

21\. The findings of the District Court on the subjects of monopoly in
exhibition and the need for divestiture are set aside as being deficient
in the light of the principles stated in this opinion, in *United
States* v. *Griffith, ante*, p. 100, and in *Schine Chain Theatres* v.
*United States, ante*, p. 110, and because of the elimination from the
decree of the provisions for competitive bidding. The injunction against
the five major defendants expanding their theatre holdings in any manner
is also set aside, in order that the District Court may make an entirely
fresh start on these phases of the problems. Pp. 167-175.

\(a\) In determining the need for divestiture,** \[\*\*\*\*11\] ** it is
not enough to conclude, as the District Court did, that none of the
defendants was organized or has been maintained for the purpose of
achieving a \"national monopoly,\" nor that the five major defendants
through their present theatre holdings \"alone\" do not and cannot
collectively or individually have a monopoly of exhibition. P. 171.

\(b\) When the starting point is a conspiracy to effect a monopoly
through restraints of trade, it is relevant to determine what the
results of the conspiracy were, even if they fell short of monopoly. P.
171.

\(c\) While a monopoly resulting from the ownership of the only theatre
in a town usually does not constitute a violation of the Sherman Act,
even such an ownership is vulnerable in a suit under the Sherman Act if
the property was acquired, or its strategic position maintained, as a
result of practices which constitute unreasonable restraints of trade.
*United States* v. *Griffith, ante*, p. 100. P. 171.

\(d\) The problem of the District Court did not end with enjoining
continuance of the unlawful restraints nor with dissolving the
combination which launched their conspiracy; its function includes also
undoing what the conspiracy achieved. ** \[\*\*\*\*12\] ** P. 171.

\(e\) The problem under the Sherman Act is not solved merely by
measuring monopoly in terms of size or extent of holdings or by
concluding that single ownerships were not obtained \"for the purpose of
achieving a national monopoly.\" P. 172.

\(f\) It is the relationship of the unreasonable restraints of trade to
the position of the defendants in the exhibition field (and more
particularly in the first-run phase of that business) that is of first
importance on the divestiture phase of these cases. P. 172.

\(g\) The fruits of the conspiracy must be denied to the five major
defendants, as they were to the independents in *Schine Chain Theatres*
v. *United States, ante*, p. 110. P. 172.

\(h\) Section 1 of the Sherman Act outlaws unreasonable restraints
irrespective of the amount of trade or commerce involved and § 2
condemns monopoly of any appreciable part of trade or commerce. P. 173.

\(i\) Specific intent is not a necessary element of a purpose or intent
to create a monopoly; the requisite purpose or intent is present if
monopoly results as a necessary consequence of what was done. P. 173.

\(j\) Monopoly power, whether lawfully or unlawfully acquired, may
violate § 2 of** \[\*\*\*\*13\] ** the Sherman Act though it remains
unexercised; the existence of the power to exclude competition when it
is desired to do so is itself a violation of § 2, if it is coupled with
the purpose or intent to exercise that power. P. 173.

\(k\) The setting aside of the provision of the decree enjoining the
five major defendants from further expanding their theatre holdings is
not to be taken as intimating in any way that the District Court erred
in including this prohibition. P. 175.

22\. Vertical integration of producing, distributing and exhibiting
motion pictures is not illegal *per se*; its legality depends upon (1)
the purpose or intent with which it was conceived or (2) the power it
creates and the attendant purpose or intent. Pp. 173-174.

\(a\) It violates the Sherman Act if it was a calculated scheme to gain
control over an appreciable segment of the market and to restrain or
suppress competition, rather than an expansion to meet legitimate
business needs. P. 174.

\(b\) A vertically integrated enterprise will constitute a monopoly
which, though unexercised, violates the Sherman Act, if a power to
exclude competition is coupled with a purpose or intent to do so. P.
174.

\(c\) The** \[\*\*\*\*14\] ** fact that the power created by size was
utilized in the past to crush or prevent competition is potent evidence
that the requisite purpose or intent attends the presence of monopoly
power. P. 174.

\(d\) Likewise bearing on the question whether monopoly power is created
by a vertical integration, is the nature of the market to be served and
the leverage on the market which the particular vertical integration
creates or makes possible. P. 174.

The suit was instituted by the United States under § 4 of the Sherman
Act to prevent and restrain violations of it. The defendants fall into
three groups: (1) Paramount Pictures, Inc., Loew\'s, Incorporated,
Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corporation, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., Twentieth
Century-Fox Film Corporation, which produce motion pictures, and their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates which distribute and exhibit
films. These are known as the five major defendants or
exhibitor-defendants. (2) Columbia Pictures Corporation and Universal
Corporation, which produce motion pictures, and their subsidiaries which
distribute films. (3) United Artists Corporation, which is engaged only
in the ** \[\*\*\*1284\] ** distribution of motion pictures. The five
majors, through their subsidiaries or affiliates, own or control
theatres; the other defendants do not.

The complaint charged . . . that the five major defendants had engaged
in a conspiracy to restrain and monopolize, and had restrained and
monopolized, interstate trade in the exhibition of motion pictures in
most of the larger cities of the country. It charged that the vertical
combination of producing, distributing, and exhibiting motion pictures
by each of the five major defendants violated [*[§

of the Act. . . .

*Third. Monopoly, Expansion of Theatre Holdings, Divestiture*.

. . . .

The chief argument at the bar is phrased in terms of monopoly of
exhibition, restraints on exhibition, and the like. Actually, the issue
is even narrower than that. The main contest is over the cream of the
exhibition business \-- that of the first-run theatres. By defining the
issue so narrowly we do not intend to belittle its importance. It shows,
however, that the question here is not ** \[\*167\] ** *what* the public
will see or *if* the public will be permitted to see certain features.
It is clear that under the existing system the public will be denied
access to none. If the public cannot see the features on the first-run,
it may do so on the second, third, fourth, or later run. The central
problem presented by these cases is which exhibitors get the
** \[\*\*934\] ** highly profitable first-run business. . . .

The controversy over monopoly relates to monopoly in exhibition and more
particularly monopoly in the first-run phase of the exhibition business.

The five majors in 1945 had interests in somewhat over 17 per cent of
the theatres in the United States \-- 3,137 out of 18,076. [^3] Those
theatres paid 45 per cent of the total domestic ** \[\*\*\*1298\] **
film rental received by all eight defendants.

** \[\*\*\*\*65\] ** In the 92 cities of the country with populations
over 100,000 at least 70 per cent of all the first-run theatres are
affiliated with one or more of the five majors. In 4 of those cities the
five majors have no theatres. In 38 of those cities there are no
independent first-run theatres. In none of the remaining 50 cities did
less ** \[\*168\] ** than three of the distributor-defendants license
their product on first run to theatres of the five majors. In 19 of the
50 cities less than three of the distributor-defendants licensed their
product on first run to independent theatres. In a majority of the 50
cities the greater share of all of the features of defendants were
licensed for first-run exhibition in the theatres of the five majors.

In about 60 per cent of the 92 cities having populations of over
100,000, independent theatres compete with those of the five majors in
first-run exhibition. In about 91 per cent of the 92 cities there is
competition between independent ** \[257\] ** theatres and the theatres
of the five majors or between theatres of the five majors themselves for
first-run exhibition. In all of the 92 cities there is always
competition in some run even where there is no
competition** \[\*\*\*\*66\] ** in first runs.

In cities between 25,000 and 100,000 populations the five majors have
interests in 577 of a total of 978 first-run theatres or about 60 per
cent. In about 300 additional towns, mostly under 25,000, an operator
affiliated with one of the five majors has all of the theatres in the
town.

The District Court held that the five majors could not be treated
collectively so as to establish claims of general monopolization in
exhibition. It found that none of them was organized or had been
maintained \"for the purpose of achieving a national monopoly\" in
exhibition. It found that the five majors by their present theatre
holdings \"alone\" (which aggregate a little more than one-sixth of all
the theatres in the United States), \"do not and cannot collectively or
individually, have a monopoly of exhibition.\" The District Court also
found that where a single defendant owns all of the first-run theatres
in a town, there is no sufficient proof that the acquisition was for the
purpose of creating a monopoly. It found rather that such consequence
resulted from the inertness ** \[\*169\] ** of competitors, their lack
of financial ability to build theatres comparable to those of the five
majors, ** \[\*\*\*\*67\] ** or the preference of the public for the
best-equipped theatres. And the percentage of features on the market
which any of the five majors could play in its own theatres was found to
be relatively small and in ** \[\*\*935\] ** nowise to approximate a
monopoly of film exhibition. . . .

Even in respect of the theatres jointly owned or jointly operated by the
defendants** \[\*\*\*\*68\] ** with each other or with independents, the
District Court found no monopoly or attempt to monopolize. Those joint
agreements or ownership were found only to be unreasonable restraints of
trade. The District Court, indeed, found no monopoly on any phase of the
cases, although it did find an attempt to monopolize in the fixing of
prices, the granting of unreasonable ** \[\*170\] ** clearances,
block-booking and the other unlawful restraints of trade we have already
discussed. The \"root of the difficulties,\" according to the District
Court, lay not in theatre ownership but in those unlawful practices.

The District Court did, however, enjoin the five majors from expanding
their present theatre holdings in any manner. It refused to grant the
request of the Department of Justice for total divestiture by the five
majors of their theatre holdings. It found that total divestiture would
be injurious to the five majors ** \[\*\*\*1299\] ** and damaging to the
public. Its thought on the latter score was that the new set of theatre
owners who would take the place of the five majors would be unlikely for
some years to give the public as good service as those they supplanted
\"in view of the latter\'s** \[\*\*\*\*69\] ** demonstrated experience
and skill in operating what must be regarded as in general the largest
and best equipped theatres.\" Divestiture was, it thought, too harsh a
remedy where there was available the alternative of competitive bidding.
It accordingly concluded that divestiture was unnecessary \"at least
until the efficiency of that system has been tried and found wanting.\"

It is clear, so far as the five majors are concerned, that the aim of
the conspiracy was exclusionary, *i. e*. it was designed to strengthen
their hold on the exhibition field. In other words, the conspiracy had
monopoly in exhibition for one of its goals, as the District Court held.
Price, clearance, and run are interdependent. The clearance and run
provisions of the licenses fixed the relative playing positions of all
theatres in a certain area; the minimum price
provisions** \[\*\*\*\*70\] ** were based on playing position \-- the
** \[258\] ** first-run theatres being required to charge the highest
prices, ** \[\*171\] ** the second-run theatres the next highest, and so
on. As the District Court found, \"In effect, the distributor, by the
fixing of minimum admission prices, ** \[\*\*936\] ** attempts to give
the prior-run exhibitors as near a monopoly of the patronage as
possible.\"

\[27\]It is, therefore, not enough in determining the need for
divestiture to conclude with the District Court that none of the
defendants was organized or has been maintained for the purpose of
achieving a \"national monopoly,\" nor that the five majors through
their present theatre holdings \"alone\" do not and cannot collectively
or individually have a monopoly of exhibition. For when the starting
point is a conspiracy to effect a monopoly through restraints of trade,
it is relevant to determine what the results of the conspiracy were even
if they fell short of monopoly.

\[28\] ** \[\*\*\*\*71\] ** \[29\]An example will illustrate the
problem. In the popular sense there is a monopoly if one person owns the
only theatre in town. That usually ** \[\*\*\*1300\] ** does not,
however, constitute a violation of the Sherman Act. But as we noted in
*United States* v. *Griffith, ante*, p. 100, and see *Schine Chain
Theatres, Inc*. v. *United States, ante*, p. 110, even such an ownership
is vulnerable in a suit by the United States under the Sherman Act if
the property was acquired, or its strategic position maintained, as a
result of practices which constitute unreasonable restraints of trade.
Otherwise, there would be reward from the conspiracy through retention
of its fruits. Hence the problem of the District Court does not end with
enjoining continuance of the unlawful restraints nor with dissolving the
combination which launched the conspiracy. Its function includes undoing
what the conspiracy achieved. As we have discussed in *Schine Chain
Theatres, Inc*. v. *United States, ante*, p. 110, the requirement that
the defendants restore what they unlawfully obtained is no more
punishment than the familiar** \[\*\*\*\*72\] ** remedy ** \[\*172\] **
of restitution. What findings would be warranted after such an inquiry
in the present cases, we do not know. For the findings of the District
Court do not cover this point beyond stating that monopoly was an
objective of the several restraints of trade that stand condemned.

\[30\]Moreover, the problem under the Sherman Act is not solved merely
by measuring monopoly in terms of size or extent of holdings or by
concluding that single ownerships were not obtained \"for the purpose of
achieving a national monopoly.\" It is the relationship of the
unreasonable restraints of trade to the position of the defendants in
the exhibition field (and more particularly in the first-run phase of
that business) that is of first importance on the divestiture phase of
these cases. That is the position we have taken in *Schine Chain
Theatres, Inc*. v. *United States, ante*, p. 110, in dealing with a
projection of the same conspiracy through certain large circuits. Parity
of treatment of the unaffiliated and the affiliated circuits requires
the same approach here. For the fruits of the conspiracy
which** \[\*\*\*\*73\] ** are denied the independents must also be
denied the five majors. In this connection there is a suggestion that
one result of the conspiracy was a geographical division of territory
among the five majors. We mention it not to intimate that it is true but
only to indicate the appropriate extent of the inquiry concerning the
effect of the conspiracy in theatre ownership by the five majors.

\[31\]\[32\]\[33\]\[34\]The findings of the District Court are deficient
on that score and obscure on another. The District Court in its findings
speaks of the absence of a \"purpose\" on the part of any of the five
majors to achieve a \"national monopoly\" in the exhibition of motion
pictures. First, there is no finding as to the presence or absence of
monopoly on the part of the five majors in the *first-run* field for the
entire country, in the *first-run* field in the 92 largest cities of the
country, ** \[\*\*\*\*74\] ** or in the *first-run* field in separate
localities. Yet the *first-run* field, which constitutes the cream of
the ** \[\*173\] ** exhibition business, is the core of the present
cases. Section 1 of the Sherman Act outlaws unreasonable restraints
irrespective of the amount of trade or commerce involved ( [*[United
States]{.underline}* *[v.]{.underline}* *[Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310
U.S. 150, 224, 225, n.
59]{.underline}*](https://plus.lexis.com/api/document?collection=cases&id=urn:contentItem:3S4X-7110-003B-72F4-00000-00&context=1530671)),
and [*[§
2]{.underline}*](https://plus.lexis.com/api/document?collection=statutes-legislation&id=urn:contentItem:8S9D-W4V2-8T6X-74X4-00000-00&context=1530671)
condemns monopoly of \"any part\" of trade or commerce. \"Any part\" is
construed ** \[\*\*937\] ** to mean an appreciable part of interstate or
foreign trade or commerce. [*[United States]{.underline}*
*[v.]{.underline}* *[Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218,
225]{.underline}*](https://plus.lexis.com/api/document?collection=cases&id=urn:contentItem:3S4X-JTV0-003B-S04W-00000-00&context=1530671).
Second, we pointed out in *United States* v. *Griffith, ante*, p. 100,
that \"specific intent\" is not necessary to establish a \"purpose or
** \[\*\*\*1301\] ** intent\" to create a monopoly but that the
requisite \"purpose or intent\" is present if monopoly results as a
necessary consequence of what was done. The findings of the District
Court on this phase of the** \[\*\*\*\*75\] ** cases are not clear,
though we take them to mean by the absence of \"purpose\" the absence of
a specific intent. So construed they are inconclusive. In any event they
are ambiguous and must be recast on remand of the cases. Third, monopoly
power, whether lawfully or unlawfully acquired, may violate [*[§
2]{.underline}*](https://plus.lexis.com/api/document?collection=statutes-legislation&id=urn:contentItem:8S9D-W4V2-8T6X-74X4-00000-00&context=1530671)
of the Sherman Act though it remains unexercised (*United States* v.
*Griffith, ante*, p. 100), for ** \[259\] ** as we stated in *American
Tobacco Co*. v. [*[United States, 328 U.S. 781, 809,
811]{.underline}*](https://plus.lexis.com/api/document?collection=cases&id=urn:contentItem:3S4X-JX10-003B-S29W-00000-00&context=1530671),
the existence of power \"to exclude competition when it is desired to do
so\" is itself a violation of [*[§
2]{.underline}*](https://plus.lexis.com/api/document?collection=statutes-legislation&id=urn:contentItem:8S9D-W4V2-8T6X-74X4-00000-00&context=1530671),
provided it is coupled with the purpose or intent to exercise that
power. The District Court, being primarily concerned with the number and
extent of the theatre holdings of defendants, did not address itself to
this phase of the monopoly problem. Here also, parity of treatment as
between independents and the five majors as theatre owners, who were
tied into the same general conspiracy, necessitates consideration of
this question.

\[35\]** \[\*\*\*\*76\] **\[36\]Exploration of these phases of the cases
would not be necessary if, as the Department of Justice argues, vertical
integration of producing, distributing and exhibiting ** \[\*174\] **
motion pictures is illegal *per se*. But the majority of the Court does
not take that view. In the opinion of the majority the legality of
vertical integration under the Sherman Act turns on (1) the purpose or
intent with which it was conceived, or (2) the power it creates and the
attendant purpose or intent. First, it runs afoul of the Sherman Act if
it was a calculated scheme to gain control over an appreciable segment
of the market and to restrain or suppress competition, rather than an
expansion to meet legitimate business needs. [*[United
States]{.underline}* *[v.]{.underline}* *[Reading Co., 253 U.S. 26,
57]{.underline}*](https://plus.lexis.com/api/document?collection=cases&id=urn:contentItem:3S4X-55K0-003B-H45F-00000-00&context=1530671);

Second, a vertically integrated enterprise, like other aggregations of
business units ( [*[United States]{.underline}* *[v.]{.underline}*
*[Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d

will constitute monopoly which, though unexercised, violates the Sherman
Act provided a power to exclude competition is coupled with a purpose or
intent to do so. As we pointed out in *United States* v. *Griffith,
ante*, p. 100, 107, n. 10, size is itself an earmark of monopoly power.
For size carries with it an opportunity for abuse. And the fact that the
power created by size was utilized in the past to crush or prevent
competition is potent evidence that the requisite purpose or intent
attends the presence of monopoly power. See [*[United
States]{.underline}* *[v.]{.underline}* *[Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106,
116]{.underline}*](https://plus.lexis.com/api/document?collection=cases&id=urn:contentItem:3S4X-CY30-003B-73NH-00000-00&context=1530671);

Likewise bearing on the question whether monopoly power is created by
the vertical integration, is the nature of the market to be served (
[*[United States]{.underline}* *[v.]{.underline}* *[Aluminum Co. of
America, supra, p.
430]{.underline}*](https://plus.lexis.com/api/document?collection=cases&id=urn:contentItem:3S4X-4XC0-003B-027W-00000-00&context=1530671)),
and the leverage on the market which the particular vertical integration
creates or makes possible.

\[37\]These** \[\*\*\*\*78\] ** matters were not considered by the
District Court. For that reason, as well as the others we have
mentioned, the findings on monopoly and divestiture which we have
discussed in this part of the opinion will be set aside. . . .

It follows that the provision of the decree barring the five majors from
further theatre expansion should likewise be eliminated. For it too is
related to the monopoly question; and the District Court should be
allowed to make an entirely fresh start on the whole of the problem. We
in no way intimate, however, that the District Court erred in
prohibiting further theatre expansion by the five majors.

**. . . . **

The judgment in these cases is affirmed in part and reversed in part,
and the cases are remanded to the District Court for proceedings in
conformity with this opinion.

*So ordered*.
