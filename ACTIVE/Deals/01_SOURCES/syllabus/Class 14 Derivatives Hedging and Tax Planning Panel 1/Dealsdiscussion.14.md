**Discussion Questions \# 14 (Panel 1)**

**Derivatives: Hedging and Tax Planning**

> I. ***Hedging***

1\. What is the difference between hedging and speculation?

2\. Issuer, a corporation, needs to borrow money for two years. If it
issued a typical fixed rate debt instrument, Issuer would pay a coupon
of 6% every year. Instead, Issuer offers something a bit fancier.
Investors pay \$100, and receive their \$100 back after two years. In
addition, instead of receiving \$6 of interest each year, the interest
they receive varies, depending on the level of hurricane damage in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida during that year. Specifically, if the dollar value
of the hurricane damage (as measured by a federal agency) is less than
\$1 billion, the Issuer pays \$12. But if the dollar value of the
hurricane exceeds \$1 billion, the Issuer pays no coupon for that year.

3\. Jane makes fine jewelry for sale over the Internet. Her father
taught her the trade, and her "value added" is that of an artist. She
has an eye for beauty, and can turn molten metal into works of art. But
Jane has never liked the business world and, in particular, she has no
idea which way the price of gold will go. Her problem is that gold and
other precious metals are essential ingredients, and they make her
profit margin hard to predict. What should Jane do?

4\. Oilco has a new well that its geologists believe is very promising.
If Oilco invests \$34 million now, it will be able to bring 1 million
barrels of oil to market in one year -- something that would be
profitable at today's \$65 per barrel price of oil. Yet Oilco is worried
that the price of oil might decline below \$65. Indeed, Oilco is
considering abandoning the project as too risky, given the volatility in
the spot oil markets.

A.  Suggest various solutions to this problem.

B.  You are a diversified shareholder of Oilco, which is a public
    company. Why might you oppose the use of derivatives by management
    to hedge the above risk? Why might you favor such hedging?

> II\. ***Tax Deferral***

5\. Assume that interest rates are 10%. (This obviously is not the case,
but it's helpful to use round numbers.) What is it worth if someone
lends you \$100 for a year and charges you no interest?

6\. If you have to pay someone \$100 in one year, and interest rates are
10%, how much do you have to set aside now in order to pay \$100 in one
year? This amount is called the present value of your obligation.

7\. Assume interest rates are 10%, and that you owe \$100 of tax this
year. If you are able to pay the tax next year instead (and don't have
to pay any interest in putting off your tax), do you save any money by
delaying the tax? If so, how much?

8\. True or false: By delaying (or "deferring") your tax, you reduce its
present value.

9\. To see an example of basic tax planning, you will need to know the
following four rules:

> A. If you make money on a derivative, you have to pay tax on the
> amount of your profit. Let's assume you make \$1000 and the tax rate
> is 50%. You keep \$500 and the government receives \$500.
>
> B. If you lose money on a derivative, you can use the loss to reduce
> your tax bill. This means the government will also lose money when you
> lose money. If you lose \$1000 and the tax rate is 50%, you lose \$500
> and the government loses \$500 (because you pay \$500 less in taxes).
>
> C. Assume that you don't have to pay tax (and cannot claim a loss)
> until you settle the derivative. That can happen when the derivative
> reaches its "maturity date (so that it is scheduled to expire), or it
> can happen you can choose to settle it early.
>
> D. Finally, assume that you compute how much tax you owe every year.
> Money you earn before midnight on December 31 is taxed this year,
> while money earned after midnight is taxed next year.

10\. Ellen earns \$100,000 each year in her job and pays a 50% tax on
what she earns, so that she ends up keeping only \$50,000. She would
like to keep more of her money. So she tries the following tax planning
strategy, which is called a "straddle." She enters into a forward
contract to buy an amount of a commodity ("Commodity") on January 1,
2023 for \$100,000 ("the long forward"). At the same time, she enters
into a second forward contract, obligating her to sell exactly the same
amount of Commodity on January 1, 2023 for \$100,000 ("the short
forward").

> A. Can she make any money on these contracts? For example, let's say
> Commodity is worth \$120,000 on January 1, 2023. How much money does
> she earn (pretax) on the long? How much does she lose (pretax) on the
> short? What is the effect of the two together?
>
> B. Let's say Commodity is worth \$70,000 on January 1, 2023. How much
> money does she lose (pretax) on the long forward? How much does she
> earn (pretax) on the short forward? What is the effect of the two
> together?
>
> C. Assume that Commodity prices are \$120,000 at 11:59pm on December
> 31, 2022, so Ellen cancels her short contract, and pays \$20,000 to
> settle it a day early (on December 31). Then at 12:01am on January 1,
> 2023, she cancels the long contract, receiving \$20,000. When you look
> at both the long and the short forwards combined, how much money
> (pretax) has she earned or lost?
>
> D. Remember that Ellen can subtract her losses from her taxable
> income. In 2022, she earned \$100,000 in her job, but lost \$20,000 in
> cancelling her short forward (a day early on December 31). What is her
> taxable income? If she pays a 50% tax, how much tax does she owe? If
> instead she earned \$100,000 and had no losses on derivatives, how
> much would her taxable income be and how much tax would she pay? How
> much (if any) tax does she save in 2022 by entering into this
> straddle?
>
> E. Ellen again earns \$100,000 in her job in 2023. In addition, she
> receives \$20,000 in settling her long forward. What's her total
> taxable income? What's her total tax (at a 50% rate)?
>
> F. What was the effect of this tax planning strategy? Why is it
> valuable to Ellen?
