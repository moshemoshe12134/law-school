**I. An Overview of the Organizational and Contractual Structure of U.S.
Venture Capital**

An overview of the U.S. venture capital market begins with its funding
sources. Institutional investors dominate U.S. venture capital. Over the
four years between 1992 and 1995, institutional investors -- pension
funds, banks, insurance companies, and endowments and foundations --
represented over 75 percent of the total capital raised by venture
capital funds. In particular, pension funds alone on average represented
more than 46 percent of total capital raised.[^1] These institutions
typically invest through intermediaries -- venture capital limited
partnerships, usually called "venture capital funds," in which the
investors are passive limited partners.[^2] Venture capital funds are
typically blind pools. At the time an institution decides whether to
participate in a venture capital fund, it receives an offering
memorandum that discloses the fund's investment strategy -- for example,
that the fund will specialize in a particular industry, like the
internet, or a distinct development stage, like early stage investments.
However, the particular companies in which the fund will invest are not
yet known. Consistent with the legal rules governing limited
partnerships, the limited partners may not participate in the day to day
management of the fund's business, including especially the approval of
particular portfolio company investments.[^3] In this respect, the
venture capital fund's governance structure formalizes the standard
Berle-Means problem of the separation of ownership and control.[^4] The
general partner (GP) puts up only one percent of the capital, but
receives essentially complete control over all of it.[^5] The particular
terms of the fund's governance are set out in the limited partnership
agreement.[^6]

The GP actually makes and monitors the venture capital fund's
investments. The GP is typically itself a company comprised of
investment professionals, which expects to continue in the venture
capital market by raising successive funds after the capital in a
particular fund has been invested in portfolio companies. Commonly the
GP will begin seeking investors for a successor fund by the midpoint of
the existing funds fixed, typically ten year, term. At the close of the
partnership's fixed term, liquidation is mandatory. Indeed, the
partnership will be in partial liquidation during much of its term
because realized profits are required to be distributed to the limited
partners on an annual basis.[^7] The GP's principle contribution to the
venture capital fund is expertise, not capital. This is reflected in the
ratio of capital contributions. In most funds, the GP contributes one
percent of the fund's capital, while the limited partner investors
contribute the remaining 99 percent.

The GP's compensation is also skewed. The GP usually receives an annual
management fee for its services, but the fee is relatively small,
usually 2.5 percent of committed capital.[^8] The primary return to the
general partner is a carried interest -- that is, a right to receive a
specified percentage of profits realized by the partnership. Twenty
percent is a common figure.[^9] The GP generally receives its carried
interest at the same time that distributions are made to the limited
partners, subject to two limitations. First, general partners typically
receive no distributions until the limited partners have received an
amount equal to their capital contributions, sometimes with interest.
Second, distributions to the GP are subject to certain "claw back"
provisions that ensure that the order of distribution does not affect
the ultimate percentage of profits received by the GP.

The venture capital fund's equity investments in portfolio companies
typically take the form of convertible preferred stock.^1^[^10] While
not required by the formal legal documents, the fund is also expected to
make important non-cash contributions to the portfolio company. These
contributions consist of management assistance, corresponding to that
provided by management consultants; intensive monitoring of the
portfolio company's performance which provides an objective view to the
entrepreneur; and the use of the fund's reputation to give the portfolio
company credibility with potential customers, suppliers, and
employees.^1^[^11] While each investment will have a "lead" investor who
plays the primary role in monitoring and advising the portfolio company,
commonly the overall investment is syndicated with other venture capital
funds that invest in the portfolio company at the same time and on the
same terms.^1^[^12]

The initial venture capital investment usually will be insufficient to
fund the portfolio company's entire business plan. Accordingly,
investment will be \"staged.\" A particular investment round will
provide only the capital the business plan projects as necessary to
achieve specified milestones set out in the business plan.^1^[^13] While
first round investors expect to participate in subsequent investment
rounds,^1^[^14] they are not contractually obligated to do so even if
the business plan's milestones are met; the terms of later rounds of
investment are negotiated at the time the milestones are met and the
prior investment exhausted. Like the provision of non-capital
contributions, implicit, not explicit contract governs the venture
capital fund's right and obligation to provide additional rounds of
financing if the portfolio company performs as expected. The venture
capital fund's implicit right to participate in subsequent rounds is
protected by an explicit right of first refusal.

A critical feature of the governance structure created by the venture
capital fund's investment in the portfolio company is the
disproportionate allocation of control to the fund.^1^[^15] In direct
contrast to the familiar Berle-Means governance structure where the
outside investors have disproportionately less control than equity, the
governance structure of a venture capital-backed early stage, high
technology company allocates to the venture capital investors
disproportionately greater control than equity. It is common for venture
capital investors to have the right to name a majority of a portfolio
company's directors even though their stock represents less than a
majority of the portfolio company's voting power.^1^[^16] Additionally,
the portfolio company will also enter into a series of contractual
negative covenants that require the venture capital investors' approval
before the portfolio company can take certain business decisions, such
as acquisition or disposition of significant amounts of assets, or a
material deviation from the business plan. The extent of these negative
covenants is related to whether the venture capital investors have
control of the board of directors; board control acts as a partial
substitute for covenant restrictions.^1^[^17]

These formal levers of control are complemented by the informal control
elements that result from the staged financing structure. Because a
financing round will not provide funds sufficient to complete the
portfolio company's business plan, staged financing in effect delegates
to the investors, in the form of the decision whether to provide
additional financing, the decision whether to continue the company's
project.^1^[^18]

Two final characteristics of investments in portfolio companies concern
their terms and their expected performance. While these are not
short-term investments, neither are they expected to be long-term.
Because venture capital limited partnerships have limited, usually10
year terms,^1^[^19] GP's have a strong incentive to cause the fund's
portfolio company investments to become liquid as quickly as possible.
Assuming that the GP has invested all of a fund's capital by the
midpoint of the fund's life, the GP then must seek to raise additional
capital for a new fund in order to remain in the venture capital
business. Because the performance of a GP's prior funds will be an
important determinant of its ability to raise capital for a new fund,
early harvesting of a fund's investments will be beneficial.^2^[^20]
Venture capital funds exit successful investments by two general
methods: taking the portfolio company public through an initial public
offering of its stock (an "IPO"); or selling the portfolio company to
another firm. The likelihood of exit by an IPO or a sale has differed
over different periods. Between 1984 and 1990, 396 venture
capital-backed firms went public, while 628 such firms were sold to
other firms before going public. Between 1991 and 1996, the order
reversed, with 1059 firms going public and 524 being sold.^2^[^21] While
it is not uncommon for the terms of a venture capital preferred stock
investment to give the venture capital fund the right to require the
portfolio company to redeem its stock, redemption is not a viable exit
mechanism because portfolio companies lack the funds to effect the
redemption.^2^[^22] Such put rights are better understood as a control
device that can force the portfolio company to accommodate the fund's
desire to exit by way of IPO or sale.

The fact that portfolio company investments are of limited duration
rather than long term is critical to the operation of the venture
capital market.^2^[^23] The non-cash contributions made by the venture
capital fund to the portfolio company -- management assistance
monitoring, and service as a reputational intermediary -- share a
significant economy of scope with its provision of capital. The
portfolio company must evaluate the quality of the fund's proffered
management assistance and monitoring, just as potential employees,
suppliers and customers must evaluate the fund's representations
concerning the portfolio company's quality. Combining financial and
nonfinancial contributions enhances the credibility of the information
the venture capital fund proposes to provide the portfolio company and
third parties. Put simply, the venture capital fund bonds the accuracy
of its information with its investment.

The importance of the portfolio company investment's limited duration
reflects the fact that the venture capital fund's non-cash contributions
have special value to early stage companies. As the portfolio company
gains its own experience, and develops its own reputation, the value of
the venture capital fund's provision of those elements declines. By the
time a portfolio company succeeds, and the venture capital fund's exit
from the investment is possible, the fund's non-cash contributions can
be more profitably invested in a new round of early stage companies. But
because of the economies of scope between cash and non-cash
contributions, recycling the venture capital fund's non-cash
contributions also requires recycling its cash contributions. Exit from
a fund's investments in successful portfolio companies thus serves to
recycle its cash and, therefore, its associated non-cash contributions
from successful companies to early stage companies.

The risk associated with portfolio company investments is reflected in
the variability of returns. While some investments return many multiples
of the original investment, a survey of the performance of venture
capital-backed companies, not limited to early stage technology
companies and therefore presenting less uncertainty than the category of
investments that concern us here, reports wide variation in returns. In
the sample studied, 50 percent of the total return was provided by only
6.8 percent of the investments. Over a third of the investments resulted
in partial or total loss.^2^[^24]

**II. The Economics of Venture Capital Contracting: the Special Problems
of Uncertainty, Information Asymmetry, and Agency Costs**

All contracts respond to three central problems: uncertainty,
information asymmetry, and agency costs. The special character of
venture capital contracting is shaped by the fact that investing in
early stage, high technology companies presents these three problems in
extreme form. Precisely because the portfolio company is at an early
stage, uncertainty concerning future performance is magnified. Virtually
all of the important decisions bearing on the company's success remain
to be made, and most of the significant uncertainties concerning the
outcome of the company's efforts remain unresolved. To the extent the
entrepreneur is beginning her first company, additional uncertainty
concerns the quality of the company's management, which takes on
heightened importance because so large a portion of the portfolio
company's value depends on management's future decisions. Finally, the
technology base of the portfolio company's business exacerbates the
general uncertainty by adding scientific uncertainty -- the
entrepreneur's beliefs about the underlying science sought to be
commercialized may prove incorrect. Some evidence of the extent of
uncertainty appears from the large variance in returns from portfolio
company investments.^2^[^25]

The same factors expand the information asymmetries between potential
investors and entrepreneurs, as intentions and abilities are far less
observable than actions already taken. Similarly, the fact that the
portfolio company's technology involves cutting edge science assures
that the information asymmetry between the entrepreneur, typically
directly involved in the company's research effort, and the venture
capital fund, even if the fund employs individuals with advanced
scientific training, will be unusually wide.

Finally, the importance of future managerial decisions in an early stage
company whose value depends almost entirely on future growth options,
creates potentially very large agency costs,^2^[^26] which are in turn
amplified by the significant variance associated with an early stage,
high technology company's expected returns. Because the entrepreneur's
stake in a portfolio company with venture capital financing can be
fairly characterized as an option, the entrepreneur's interests will
sharply diverge from those of the venture capital investors, especially
with respect to the risk level and duration of the investment.^2^[^27]

The organizational and contractual structure of the U.S. venture capital
market responds to this trio of problems. The effectiveness of the
response serves to make the venture capital market feasible. Absent a
workable response, the extremity of uncertainty, information asymmetry,
and agency problems likely would raise the cost of external capital to a
point of market failure, leading to a similar collapse in the formation
of early stage, high technology companies. Because of the link between
firm size and innovation,^2^[^28] institutional and contractual
techniques thus have an important influence on the successful
commercialization of cutting edge science.

The organizational and contractual techniques observed in the venture
capital market reflect three basic characteristics. First, very high
power *incentives* for all participants -- investors, GPs, and
entrepreneurs -- are coupled with very intense *monitoring*.^2^[^29]
Second, the organizational and contractual structure reflects the use of
both explicit and implicit contracts. Thus, the governance structure of
both the portfolio company and the venture capital fund is composed of
market as well as formal aspects. Third, a pivotal aspect of this mix of
formal and market governance, especially repeat play and reputation
mechanisms, is that the two contracting nodes which comprise the venture
capital market -- the venture capital fund limited partnership agreement
and the portfolio company investment contract, are determined
simultaneously. As we will see, this braiding of the two relationships
facilitates the resolution of problems internal to each.

In this Part, we show how multiple forms of incentive and monitoring
techniques, including contractual, control, and market mechanisms,
operate in connection with each contracting node to resolve the problems
of uncertainty, information asymmetry and agency associated with early
stage, high technology financing. We consider first the venture capital
fund-portfolio company contract and then turn to the investor-venture
capital fund limited partnership agreement. Finally, we consider the
importance of the braiding of these two contracts.

**A. The Venture Capital Fund-Portfolio Company Contract**

Five organizational and contractual techniques discussed in Part I --
staged financing, allocation of elements of control, form of
compensation, the role of exit, and reliance on implicit contracts --
respond to the problems poseded by financial contracting in the face of
extreme forms of uncertainty, information asymmetry, and agency costs.

1\. [Staged Financing]{.underline}. As discussed in Part I, venture
capital investments are usually staged, with funding decisions keyed to
milestones in the business plan. Because the venture capital fund has
the right, but not the obligation, to fund subsequent stages of
development, the structure gives the investor a valuable option to
abandon. This structure responds directly to the *uncertainty*
associated with contracting for early stage, high technology
investments. The milestones in the business plan are keyed to events
that, because their occurrence reveals important information, reduce the
uncertainty associated with the project's ultimate success. Thus, a
first milestone may be the creation of an operating prototype, which
eliminates uncertainty about the portfolio company's ability to reduce
its science to a commercial product. The decision about additional
investment is then made only after the passage of time and performance
has replaced projection with fact. The result is to reduce the
uncertainty associated with the funding of further rounds of
investment.^3^[^30]

Without more, however, staged financing does not increase the expected
value of the portfolio company\'s project. To be sure, the investor
receives an option to abandon, but the value of that option to the
recipient is exactly balanced by the cost of option to its writer, the
entrepreneur. Absent an unrealistic assumption about investor risk
aversion, merely shifting exogenous uncertainty from the investor to the
entrepreneur does not create value.^3^[^31] For this to occur, staged
financing must accomplish something more.

The first respect in which staged financing creates, rather than merely
transfers, value is its reduction in the *agency problems* associated
with the entrepreneur's management of the portfolio company's operation.
Staged financing aligns the interests of the venture capital fund and
the entrepreneur by creating a substantial performance incentive. If the
portfolio company does not meet the milestone whose completion was
funded in the initial round of financing, the venture capital fund has
the power to shut the project down by declining to fund the project's
next round.^3^[^32] Even if the venture capital fund chooses to continue
the portfolio company's project by providing another round of financing,
a performance penalty still can be imposed by assigning the portfolio
company a lower value for purposes of the price paid in the new round.
To be sure, the portfolio company may seek financing from other sources
if the existing investors decline to go forward, or are willing to go
forward only at an unfavorable price, but the overall contractual
structure significantly reduces the availability of a market
alternative.

First, potential investors know they are being solicited only because
investors in the prior round are dissatisfied with the portfolio
company's performance. Second, the investors rights agreement gives the
venture capital fund a right of first refusal with respect to future
financing that serves as a substantial deterrent to potential
alternative investors. Such an investor will be reluctant to make the
investment in information necessary to deciding whether to make an
investment knowing that that investment will at least be significantly
reduced if the terms negotiated turn out to be attractive, since the
existing investors will have the right to take part or all of the
transaction for themselves. Moreover, a potential investor will confront
a serious winner's curse problem. The potential investor can anticipate
that if the price negotiated is attractive, the existing investors will
opt to make the investment themselves. Thus, the potential investor
knows that it will be allowed to make the investment only if the
existing investors, who have better information about the project,
believe that the investment is unattractive.

Staged financing also reduces agency costs by shifting the decision
whether to continue the project from the entrepreneur to the venture
capital fund. Because of the option-like character of the entrepreneur's
interest in the portfolio company, she will go forward with the project
under conditions that favor her and disfavor the venture capital fund.
Shifting this decision to the venture capital fund reduces this source
of agency cost.

The incentive created by staged financing in turn operates to reduce
uncertainty in a manner that creates value, rather than merely shifting
it from the investor to the entrepreneur. While staged financing only
shifts risk with respect to exogenous uncertainty -- that is,
uncertainty which is outside the parties' capacity to influence -- it
can serve actually to reduce a different kind of uncertainty. Some
uncertainty associated with the success of the portfolio company's
project is endogenous: it can be influenced by the entrepreneur's
actions. Put differently, the likelihood of the portfolio company's
success is in part a function of the effort expended. By increasing the
incentives to expend effort, staged financing reduces this element of
uncertainty.

That brings us to the effect of staged financing on the *information
asymmetry* between the venture capital fund and the entrepreneur. Staged
financing serves to bridge the information gap in two important ways.
The first information-related property of staged financing reflects the
general principle that every incentive has an information related flip
side that responds to adverse selection problems. In deciding which
portfolio companies to fund, the venture capital fund has to distinguish
between good and bad entrepreneurs under circumstances in which an
entrepreneur has better information about her own skills than does the
investor. Because the incentive created by staged financing is more
valuable to a good entrepreneur than a bad one, an entrepreneur's
willingness to accept an intense incentive is a signal of the
entrepreneur's difficult to observe skills. The signal is particularly
important for early stage and high technology portfolio companies
because the absence of a performance history and the technical nature of
the projects makes the entrepreneur's skills particularly difficult to
observe.^3^[^33]

The second way in which staged financing reduces information asymmetry
is by its impact on the credibility of the projections contained in the
entrepreneur's business plan. These projections are critical to valuing
the portfolio company and therefore pricing the venture capital fund's
investment. Yet, the entrepreneur obviously has better information
concerning the accuracy of the business plan's projections of timing,
costs, and likelihood of success, and, without more, an incentive to
overstate the hproject\'s prospects. By accepting a contractual
structure that imposes significant penalties if the entrepreneur fails
to meets specified milestones based on the business plan's projections
\-- the venture capital fund\'s option to abandon then becomes
exercisable \-- the entrepreneur makes those projections credible.

At this point, it is helpful to note a more general contracting problem
associated with the allocation of discretion between parties to an
agreement. Discretion creates the potential for the party possessing it
to impose agency costs. Staged financing, like other organizational and
contractual techniques we will consider, responds to agency problems
that result from entrepreneur discretion by shifting that discretion to
the venture capital fund. However, this technique has a built in
limitation, which we might call the principle of the conservation of
discretion. Without more, shifting discretion from the entrepreneur to
the fund does not eliminate the potential for agency costs; it merely
shifts the chance to act opportunistically to the fund. For example,
staged financing coupled with a right of first refusal made potent by
high information costs allows the venture capital fund to behave
opportunistically in negotiating the price of a second round of
financing. The fund is in a position to exploit its monopsony power by
reducing the value assigned to the portfolio company even though it has
met its projections.^3^[^34] In such settings, the goal is to shift
discretion to that party whose misuse of it can be most easily
constrained. As will appear, misuse of the discretion shifted to the
venture capital fund is policed by market forces in the venture capital
market, whose functioning is crucial to the feasibility of the entire
organizational and contractual structure.

2\. [Control]{.underline}. A central characteristic of the governance
structure created by the venture capital fund-portfolio company contract
stands the Berle-Means problem on its head. Instead of investors having
disproportionately less control than equity as in public corporations,
the venture capital fund has disproportionately more control than
equity. Like staged financing, this allocation of control responds to
the problems of uncertainty, information asymmetry, and agency
associated with early stage, high technology investments.

Extreme *uncertainty* concerning the course and outcome of the project
stage being financed creates discretion. The presence of uncertainty
means that an explicit stage contingent contract that specifies what
action should be taken in response to all possible events cannot be
written. Thus, the contractual structure must deal with uncertainty by
means of a governance structure: creating a process that will determine
the response to an unexpected event. The particular allocation of
discretion between the fund and the portfolio company reflects the
influence of concerns over both *agency* and *information asymmetry*.

Two types of control are allocated to the venture capital fund as a
response to agency and information asymmetry problems. First, as we have
seen, staged financing allocates an important periodic lever of control
to the venture capital fund. By reserving to itself the decision whether
to fund the portfolio company's next milestone, the venture capital fund
takes control over the continuation decision; whether the portfolio
company goes forward with its project is determined by whether the
venture capital fund provides capital for the next stage. This power, in
turn, gives the venture capital fund the incentive to make the
investment in monitoring necessary to evaluate the portfolio company's
overall performance over the initial funding period. In the absence of
the power to act in response to what it discovers, the venture capital
fund would have no reason to expend time and resources in the kind of
monitoring necessary to balance the intense incentives created to align
the two parties' interests.

Second, giving the venture capital fund disproportionate representation
or even control of the portfolio company's board of directors, and the
restriction of the entrepreneur's discretion through the use of negative
covenants, gives the fund interim control -- the power to act to reduce
agency costs in the period between decisions over whether to finance
further stages. In its most extreme form, the venture capital fund's
interim control carries with it the power to replace the entrepreneur as
the portfolio company's chief executive officer. As with the allocation
of periodic control, the allocation of interim control gives the venture
capital fund the incentive to monitor the portfolio company's
performance during the course of reaching a funding milestone, and in
response to the unexpected events generated by pervasive uncertainty.
The discretion unavoidably given to the portfolio company's day to day
managers by the occurrence of unexpected events is policed by the
disproportionate control and resulting monitoring activity allocated to
the venture capital fund.

The periodic and interim monitoring encouraged by the disproportionate
allocation of control to the venture capital fund also serves to reduce
the last of the contracting problems -- information asymmetry between
the venture capital fund and the entrepreneur. The balance of
information between the parties is not static as the portfolio company
moves forward on its business plan. Ongoing learning by the entrepreneur
increases the information disparity and therefore the entrepreneur\'s
discretion, which in turn increases agency costs. Ongoing monitoring by
the venture capital fund, made possible by the disproportionate
allocation of control, balances that influence.

Finally, as with staged financing, the allocation of control serves to
reduce information asymmetry by providing the entrepreneur the
opportunity to signal her type. Giving the venture capital fund the
power to terminate the entrepreneur in the event of poor performance
gives the entrepreneur a powerful incentive to perform. The flip side of
this incentive is a signal. By her willingness to subject herself to
this penalty for poor performance, the entrepreneur credibly provides
information to the venture capital fund about her own skills.^3^[^35]

3\. [Compensation]{.underline}. The structure of the entrepreneur's
compensation responds primarily to agency costs and information
asymmetry problems. Perhaps more starkly than with any other
organizational or contractual technique, the portfolio company's
compensation structure creates extremely high powered performance
incentives that serve to align the incentives of the portfolio company
management and the venture capital fund. In essence, the overwhelming
percentage of management's compensation is dependent on the portfolio
company's success. Low salaries are offset by the potential for a large
increase in value of the entrepreneur's stock ownership, and by the
award of stock options to other management members.^3^[^36] The
performance incentive is further heightened by the practice of requiring
the entrepreneur and other members of management to accept the
imposition of a staged vesting requirement on some or all of their stock
or stock options. The vesting requirement gives the portfolio company
the right to purchase a portion of the entrepreneur's or other
management's stock, at a favorable price, if employment terminates prior
to a series of specified dates. It also restricts exercise of options
until after the manager has completed a series of employment
anniversaries, following each of which an additional number of options
both are exercisable and no longer subject to forfeiture if employment
terminates.^3^[^37]

While aligning the interests of the venture capital fund and
entrepreneur in some circumstances, the intensity of these incentives
can also lead to agency costs in other circumstances. In particular, the
option-like characteristics of the portfolio company's compensation
structure can lead the entrepreneur to increase the risk associated with
the portfolio company's future returns, because the venture capital fund
will bear a disproportionate share of the increased downside but share
only proportionately in the upside. Thus, the intensity of the
performance incentives created by the compensation structure gives rise
to a corresponding incentive for the venture capital fund to monitor the
portfolio company's performance. This monitoring, together with the
signaling properties of the entrepreneur's willingness to accept such
powerful incentives, also serve to reduce information asymmetries.

4\. [Exit]{.underline}. Another powerful incentive is created for the
entrepreneur by the terms of the disproportionate allocation of control
to the venture capital fund. On the plausible assumption that the
transfer of control to the venture capital is costly to the
entrepreneur,^3^[^38] the control structure created by the venture
capital fund's investment gives the entrepreneur a valuable call option
on control.^3^[^39] In effect, the venture capital fund and the
entrepreneur enter into a combination explicit and implicit contract
that returns to the entrepreneur the disproportionate control
transferred to the venture capital fund if the portfolio company is
successful. ^4^[^40] The explicit portion of the contract is reflected
in the terms of the convertible preferred stock which provide the
venture capital fund its disproportionate board representation, and in
those of the investors' rights agreement which contains the negative
covenants requiring venture capital fund approval of important operating
decisions. Both documents typically provide for the termination of these
levers of control on the completion of an IPO of a specified size and at
a specified price. The terms of the preferred stock almost universally
require conversion into common stock, with the resulting disappearance
of special board representation, on a public offering. The negative
covenants also expire on an IPO.^4^[^41]

The implicit portion of the contract operationalizes the definition of
success that makes the entrepreneur's call option on control
exercisable. By triggering automatic conversion on an IPO, the measure
of success is delegated to independent investment bankers who are in the
business of identifying venture capital-backed companies successful
enough to be taken public,^4^[^42] and whose own incentives make their
ex post determination of success credible ex ante. As we will see in the
next section, it also allocates to the market enforcement of the venture
capital fund's implicit promise to agree to an IPO when one is available
to the portfolio company and the entrepreneur exercises her call option
on control by requesting one.

5\. [Reliance on Implict Contract: The Role of the Reputation
Market]{.underline}. Crucial elements of the organizational and
contractual techniques that respond to uncertainty, information
asymmetry, and agency costs in the venture capital fund-portfolio
company relationship, have at their core the transfer of discretion from
the entrepreneur to the venture capital fund. Staged financing, by
giving the venture capital fund an option to abandon, transfers the
continuation decision from the entrepreneur to the fund. Board control
by the venture capital fund, including the power to dismiss the
entrepreneur herself, disproportionate to its equity, also transfers to
the fund the capacity to interfere in the portfolio company's day to day
business. As a result, the effectiveness of these techniques is subject
to the conservation of discretion principle. Reducing the agency costs
of the entrepreneur's discretion by transferring it to the venture
capital fund also transfers to the venture capitalist the potential for
agency costs -- the opportunity to use that discretion opportunistically
with respect to the entrepreneur.

For example, giving the venture capital fund an option to abandon gives
the venture capital fund an incentive to monitor, gives the entrepreneur
an incentive to perform, and reduces agency costs by shifting the
continuation decision to the venture capitalist. But when coupled with
the venture capital fund's right of first refusal, this transfer of
discretion also creates agency costs on the part of the venture capital
fund. What prevents the venture capital fund from opportunistically
offering to provide the financing necessary for the portfolio company's
next stage only at an unfairly low price? The entrepreneur could seek
financing from other sources but, as we have seen, the venture capital
fund's right of first refusal presents a serious impediment.^4^[^43]
Similarly, the transfer of disproportionate control to the venture
capital fund also creates the potential for opportunism by the fund. To
align incentives, the entrepreneur's returns from the portfolio
company's project take the form of appreciation in the value of her
portfolio company stock and stock options. However, the venture capital
fund's power to terminate entrepreneur, coupled with the vesting
requirements that on her termination both give the portfolio company a
favorably priced option to purchase the entrepreneur's stock on
termination and cancel all unvested options, gives the venture capital
fund the discretion to behave opportunistically. What prevents the
venture capital fund from unfairly terminating the entrepreneur so as to
secure for itself the returns that had been promised the entrepreneur?

The conservation of discretion principle counsels that discretion be
placed in the party whose behavior is more easily policed. In the
context of the venture capital fund-portfolio company relationship, the
presence of an effective reputation market with respect to the GP's
characteristics provides the policing that supports the transfer of
discretion to the venture capital fund.

For a reputation market to operate, three attributes must be present.
The party whose discretion will be policed by the market must anticipate
repeated future transactions. Participants must have shared expectations
of what constitutes appropriate behavior by the party to whom discretion
has been transferred. Finally, those who will deal with the advantaged
party in the future must be able to observe whether that party has
behaved in past dealings in conformity with shared expectations.^4^[^44]
All three of these attributes appear present in the venture capital
market.

Although it is unlikely that a GP will have future dealings with the
same entrepreneur,^4^[^45] as we have seen the GP will anticipate
raising successor venture capital funds, which in turn will require
future dealings with different entrepreneurs in connection with the
investing the new funds' capital. The requirements of shared
expectations of proper conduct, and the observability of a GP's
satisfaction of those expectations, also appear to be met in the venture
capital market. The community of venture capital funds is relatively
concentrated,^4^[^46] and remarkably localized. For example, the offices
of a significant percentage of U.S. venture capital funds are found
along a short strip of Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley.^4^[^47]
Moreover, venture capital funds typically concentrate their investments
in portfolio companies geographically proximate to the fund's
office.^4^[^48] This geographical concentration of providers and users
of venture capital facilitates satisfaction of the informational element
of the structure of a reputation model. Saxanian notes that geographical
proximity has fostered in Silicon Valley extremely efficient informal
transfers of information concerning the performance of GPs and
entrepreneurs.^4^[^49] Credible accounts of opportunistic behavior by
particular GPs can be expected to circulate quickly among members of the
entrepreneur community who must select a GP with whom to deal, and among
members of the GP community, who must compete among themselves for the
opportunity to invest in the most promising portfolio companies and
therefore have an interest in noting and transmitting to the
entrepreneur community instances of misbehavior by a rival.

**B. The Investor-Venture Capital Fund Contract**

In this part, we turn to the investor-venture capital fund contract. How
do the organizational and contractual techniques discussed in Part I --
virtually complete control vested in the GP, incentive compensation,
mandatory distribution of realized investments, and mandatory
liquidation after a fixed term^5^[^50] -- respond to the problems of
financial contracting in the face of extreme forms of uncertainty,
information asymmetry, and agency costs?^5^[^51]

1\. [Control]{.underline}. Organizing the venture capital fund as a
limited partnership serves to vest virtually complete control in the GP.
Short of participation in largely inconsequential advisory committees
and the right, typically restricted by the limited partnership
agreement, to replace the GP, the legal rules governing limited
partnership prevent investors from exercising control over the central
elements of the venture capital fund's business. Most important, the
investors are prohibited from insisting on an approval right of the GP's
investment decisions. Thus, the venture capital fund's formal governance
structure presents an extreme version of the Berle-Means problem of the
separation of ownership and control: the GP receives control grossly
disproportionate to either its one percent capital contribution or its
20 percent carried interest.

The efficiency explanation for the allocation of control to the GP
reflects in the first instance the extreme uncertainty and information
asymmetry associated with investing in early stage, high technology
portfolio companies. By investing through a financial intermediary,
investors secure the benefit of the GP's skill and experience that help
to reduce the level of uncertainty and information asymmetry that must
be addressed in the contract governing a portfolio company's investment.
However, securing the benefit of the GP's expertise comes at a cost: the
GP must be given the discretion necessary to exercise its skills and
experience on the investors' behalf. And consistent with the principle
of the conservation of discretion, the allocation of control to the GP
creates the potential for agency costs that must be addressed by other
elements of the venture capital fund's organizational and contractual
structure.

2\. [Compensation]{.underline}. The GP's compensation structure is the
front line response to the potential for agency costs resulting from
allocating to the GP the control necessary to apply its skill and
expertise on behalf of the investors. The bulk of the GP's compensation
comes in the form of a carried interest, typically 20 percent, that
gives the GP 20 percent of the venture capital fund's ultimate profits,
distributed to the general partner when realized profits are distributed
to the investor limited partners. Thus, the compensation structure
aligns the GP's interests in the fund's success with those of the
investors: the GP earns returns that are proportional to those earned by
the investors. However, other agency problems appear in the details of
the carried interest. For example, suppose that the first investment
realized by the venture capital fund yields a \$1 million profit after a
return to the investors of their \$1 million investment. The GP's share
of the profit is \$200,000. Now suppose that the next investment
realized loses \$500,000, leaving cumulative profits from the two
investments of \$500,000. If the GP keeps all of its first \$200,000
distribution, then it ends up having received not 20 percent of the
venture capital fund's profits from the two investments, but 40 percent
(\$200,000/\$500,000). This would give the GP an incentive to realize
profitable investments before unprofitable investments, even if that
meant realizing the profitable investments prematurely. Various
formulations of what are called "claw back" provisions respond to the
potential agency cost growing out of this element of uncertainty by in
one fashion or another either delaying the GP's distribution, or holding
back some portion it, until the fund's ultimate success is
known.^5^[^52]

3\. [Mandatory Distributions and Fixed Term]{.underline}. While aligning
the interests of the GP and the investors, the intensity of the GP's
compensation incentive in turn creates a different agency cost. The GP's
carried interest has option-like characteristics, which may cause it to
prefer investments of greater risk than the investors. This is
especially true with respect to the fund's later investments if the
early ones have done poorly. In that circumstance, the GP actually may
be best served by making negative net present value investments if the
investments are sufficiently risky. The same problem arises with respect
to operating decisions that concern a portfolio company that is doing
poorly. Then the option-like character of the GP's carried interest may
align its interests more closely with those of the entrepreneur whose
compensation under the venture capital fund-portfolio company also has
option-like characteristics. In that circumstance, both the GP and the
entrepreneur will prefer a riskier operating strategy that than would
best serve investors.

The venture capital fund's fixed term, together with the operation of
the reputation market, responds to this agency cost problem. The fund's
fixed term assures that at some point the market will measure the GP's
performance, making readily observable the extent to which the GP's
investment decisions favored increased risk over expected return. A GP's
performance record as revealed by its performance in previous funds is
its principal tool for persuading investors to invest in successor
funds. Thus, the limited partnership's fixed term assures that
opportunistic behavior by the GP with respect to either venture capital
fund investment decisions or portfolio company operating decisions will
be punished through the reputation market when it seeks to raise the
successor funds that justify the GP's investment in skill and experience
in the first place. The expectation of such a settling up helps support
the use of intense compensation incentives by constraining
option-induced GP opportunism.

Mandatory distribution of the proceeds from realized investments and the
venture capital fund's fixed term also respond to a different variety of
agency costs resulting from the allocation of control to the GP. Because
the GP receives a fixed fee, typically 2.5 percent, of committed
capital, the GP would have an incentive to keep capital within the fund
for as long as possible. If given the opportunity, the GP would simply
reinvest the proceeds of realized investments. Moreover, that
opportunity would make it unnecessary for GP's to raise successor funds,
the anticipation of which allows the reputation market to police GP
performance. Mandatory distribution of realized proceeds and a fixed
term respond to this potential free cash flow problem. Both devices
require that the GP allow the investors to measure its performance
against alternatives available in the market before it can continue
managing the investors money. In this respect, mandatory distributions
operate like debt in a company following a leveraged buyout in requiring
profits to be first returned to investors before the company can seek to
recover it through new investment. The fixed term operates like a
contractually imposed takeover by forcing the GP to allow the investors
to choose whether the GP should continue to manage their funds. The
organizational and contractual structure assures that a time will come
when market price serves as the measure of the GP's performance.^5^[^53]

**C. Braiding of the Venture Capital Fund-Portfolio Company and the
Investor- Venture Capital Fund Contracts**

A final means by which the organizational and contractual structure of
the venture capital-portfolio company and investor-venture capital fund
contracts responds to the contracting problems posed by extreme
uncertainty, information asymmetry, and agency costs is through the
braiding of the two contracts. By braiding we mean the fact that the
structure of the two contracts are intertwined, each operating to
provide an implicit term that supports the other, and thereby increasing
the contractual efficiency of both. This characteristic is particularly
apparent with respect to the role of exit and of the reputation market.

1\. [The Braiding of Exit]{.underline}. As we have seen, the obligation
of exit from each of the two contracts comprising the venture capital
market -- the fixed term of the investor-venture capital fund contract,
and the incentive to realize and then distribute the proceeds of the
investment that is the subject of the venture capital fund-portfolio
company contract -- responds to contracting problems presented by each
of the relationships. These two functions of exit complement each other.
As we saw in Part I, by the time a portfolio company succeeds, the
venture capital fund's non-cash contributions to a portfolio company can
be more profitably invested in a new round of early stage companies. But
because economies of scope link the provision of cash and non-cash
contributions, recycling the non-cash contributions requires the venture
capital fund to exit: to recycle its cash contribution from successful
portfolio companies to new early stage companies.^5^[^54] Moreover, the
venture capital fund's exit provides the means to give the entrepreneur
an important performance incentive: a call option on control the
exercise of which is implemented by the venture capital fund's
realization of its investment in the portfolio company by means of an
IPO.

In turn, the recycling of investments from successful portfolio
companies to new early stage companies supports the investor-venture
capital fund contract. Realizing portfolio company investments provides
a performance measure that lets investors evaluate the GP's skill and
honesty, and to reallocate their funds to the GPs with the most
successful performance. And by providing the GP's principal tool for
persuading investors to provide capital for successor funds, exit
supports the core of the incentive structure that aligns the interests
of investors and the GP.

In sum, the braiding of the role of exit in the investor-venture capital
fund contract and the venture capital fund-portfolio company contract
increases the efficiency of both contracts.

2\. [The Braiding of the Reputation Market]{.underline}. The venture
capital fund-portfolio company contract responds to a number of problems
by shifting important elements of control to the venture capital fund.
The venture capital fund's option to abandon resulting from staged
financing, its board representation and even control, and its power to
replace the entrepreneur, combine to reduce uncertainty, and to reduce
agency costs both by providing the entrepreneur powerful performance
incentives including a call option to regain control and, by providing
the venture capital fund the means and therefor the incentive to
monitor. In turn, the entrepreneur's willingness to transfer control,
and to accept so heavily incentivized a contract structure, reduces
information asymmetry by signaling the entrepreneur's type. However,
each of these transfers of discretion from the entrepreneur to the
venture capital fund carries with it the potential for opportunistic
behavior by the fund. The entrepreneur is at risk in connection with
negotiations over the terms of the next round financing, in connection
with the venture capital fund's exercise of control through board
influence and its power to replace the entrepreneur, and in connection
with the fund's ability not to honor the implicit call option on control
it has written. The efficiency of the venture capital fund-portfolio
company contract therefore requires a credible constraint on the venture
capital fund's misusing its transferred discretion.

The braiding of the venture capital fund-portfolio company contract with
the investor-venture-capital fund contract supports a reputation market
that constrains opportunistic behavior by the venture capital. Because
the fund is unlikely to engage in repeated deals with any particular
entrepreneur, the reputation market constraint instead grows out of the
investor-venture capital fund contract. Because the GP needs to raise
successor funds, it will have to make investments in new portfolio
companies run by other entrepreneurs. If a GP behaves opportunistically
toward entrepreneurs in connection with previous portfolio company
investments, it will lose access to the best new investments that, in
turn, will make raising successor funds more difficult. The impact of
the GP\'s behavior toward current portfolio companies on the success of
its future fund raising efforts serves to police the venture capital
fund's exercise of the discretion transferred to it in the venture
capital fund-portfolio company contract. In turn, the investor-venture
capital fund contract's support of the transfer of discretion to the
fund by the venture capital fund-portfolio company contract helps reduce
uncertainty, information asymmetry, and agency costs in contracting with
the portfolio company and therefore results in higher returns to
investors. And this encourages investors to reinvest in the GP's
successor funds. Again, the interaction between the two contracts
supports the efficiency of each.

    entrepreneur is risk averse with respect to the success of the
    portfolio company since, unlike the venture capital fund, she will
    not hold a diversified portfolio of financial or human capital.

[^32]: ^32^ The venture capital fund's non-capital contributions are
    also effectively staged. If the portfolio company has not performed
    satisfactorily, the GP can decline to make or receive telephone
    calls from the portfolio company or its suppliers, customers, or
    prospective employees. See Black & Gilson, supra note 3, at 254.
