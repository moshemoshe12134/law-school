**How the Cares Act Affects Net Operating Losses**

With many businesses experiencing losses due to COVID-19, now is a good
time to review the CARES Act net operating loss (NOL) rules.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) changed the rules for deducting net
operating losses in 2017. Before 2017, NOLs were fully deductible and
could be carried back two years and carried forward 20 years.

In 2017, TCJA changed the NOL rules by:

1.  limiting NOL deductions to 80% of taxable income,

2.  disallowing NOL carrybacks, and

3.  lifting the 20-year limit on NOL carryovers.

In 2020, the CARES Act temporarily -- and retroactively -- changed the
NOL rules again.

What is an NOL?

An NOL is the excess of a business's tax deductions for the tax year
over its taxable income for that year.

*Example.* For tax year 1, A has \$100,000 of gross income and \$125,000
of tax deductions. A has an NOL of \$25,000 for tax year 1.

Why do NOL deductions matter?

Not all businesses have consistent income. Some businesses experience
income volatility from year to year while other business' income is
consistent year over year. NOL deductions allow businesses to smooth out
any year-to-year income volatility. Without the NOL deduction businesses
with volatile income are taxed more over time on the same income than
business that have consistent income.

*Example.* Business A has a \$50,000 NOL in year 1 (\$0 taxable income)
and \$100,000 taxable income in year 2. It pays no tax in year 1 and tax
of \$21,000 in year 2 (assuming a 21% corporate tax rate). So, over two
years, A has a \$21,000 tax liability on \$50,000 of income.

Business B has income of \$25,000 in year 1 and in year 2 for a total of
\$50,000 of income. Business B pays \$5,250 in tax in each year for a
total tax liability of \$10,500 on \$50,000 of income. In this scenario,
A pays twice as much tax as B (\$21,000 -- \$10,500 = \$10,500).

However, if A may deduct the year 1 NOL in year 2, using the \$50,000
year 1 NOL to offset \$50,000 of its \$100,000 income, then A has a tax
liability of \$10,500 on \$50,000 of income just like B.

Can NOLs generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 be carried back?

Under the TCJA rules, businesses couldn't carry back NOLs. Under the
CARES Act, an NOL from a tax year beginning in 2018, 2019 or 2020 can be
carried back five years. Taxpayers don't have to carryback their 2018,
2019 and 2020 NOLs. They can elect to waive the carryback period and
only carry these NOLs forward to future years.

Under the CARES Act, taxpayers that carryback their NOLs must use the
entire five-year carry back period. For example, taxpayers can't elect
to use a two-year carryback period instead of the five-year carryback
period for their 2018, 2019 and 2020 NOLs.

As it stands right now, this five-year carryback provision goes away for
tax years beginning in 2021.

Does the 80%-of-income NOL limitation still apply to NOLs generated in
2018, 2019 and 2020?

NOLs generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 are still subject to the TCJA
80%-of-income limitation if they are carried forward to a year in which
the limitation applies (generally, tax years beginning after 2020).

However, NOLs generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 are not subject to the
80%-of-income limitation if they are exhausted during the five-year
carryback period or during 2018, 2019 or 2020. NOLs carried over from
pre-TCJA years aren't subject to the limitation.

Can all taxpayers take advantage of the CARES Act NOL carryback?

Generally, C corporations, individuals, estates and trusts, and
tax-exempt organizations with unrelated business taxable income can take
advantage of the CARES Act NOL carryback. Partnerships and S
corporations may be able to take advantage of the CARES Act NOL
carryback but there are different rules for passthrough entities.

On the other hand, real estate investment trusts (REITs) can't carry
back an NOL to any preceding tax year. Additionally, an NOL generated in
a tax year during which the taxpayer wasn't a REIT (non-REIT year) can't
be carried back to a year in which the taxpayer was a REIT.

The CARES Act contains an exception to this rule. The exception allows
certain taxpayers with untaxed foreign earnings from certain specified
corporations to exclude tax years with Code Sec. 965 income from their
carryback period.

Must NOLs be carried back to the earliest year in the five-year
carryback period?

Under the CARES Act, a taxpayer must carry back an NOL generated in
2018, 2019 or 2020 to the earliest year in the five-year carryback
period. If the earliest year's taxable income can't absorb all or part
of the NOL, then the taxpayer carries forward any remaining NOL to the
next carryback year with taxable income (and so on) until the NOL used
up.

Under the CARES Act can NOLs still be carried forward indefinitely?

Yes. Under the CARES Act, businesses can still carry forward NOLs
indefinitely. Indefinite NOLs are NOLs generated in a tax year beginning
after 2017. This indefinite carryforward period includes any NOLs from
2018, 2019 and 2020 that remain after they are carried back to tax years
in the five-year carryback period.

Should taxpayers carryback an NOL?

Whether a taxpayer should carryback an NOL using the CARES Act rules
depends on the taxpayer's situation. Generally, using the five-year
carryback will be better for C corporations because they can carry back
post-TCJA NOLs to offset high tax income. Pre-TCJA income was taxed at
higher rates (the TCJA reduced the highest tax rate for C corporations
from 35% to 21%). Also, a carryback can generate a refund for the prior
year even if that tax year is technically closed by the statute of
limitations.

However, carrying back an NOL to claim a refund requires filing an
amended return or tentative refund application (which can be a lot of
extra accounting and compliance work), and exposes the taxpayer to audit
risk for an otherwise closed year.

How do taxpayers apply an NOL carryback to get a refund?

Taxpayers have two options for applying the NOL carryback to prior years
and claiming a refund. They may amend the returns for all the carryback
years or file for a tentative refund claim. Filing a tentative refund
claim typically results in a faster refund.

A corporate taxpayer applies for a refund by filing Form 1139,
Corporation Application for Tentative Refund. Noncorporate taxpayers
apply for a refund by filing Form 1045, Application for Tentative
Refund.

Tentative refund claims can't be filed before the taxpayer files the
return for the tax year that generated the NOL. Generally, taxpayers
must file Forms 1139 and 1045 within 12 months of the end of the tax
year that generated the NOL.

The IRS has a 90-day period to conduct a limited examination or review
of the application for omissions or errors and can either allow or deny
the application.

Note: In April 2020, the IRS provided a temporary procedure that allows
taxpayers to file Forms 1139 and 1045 with the IRS by fax. This
temporary procedure expires at the end of 2020, so the fax number will
no longer work as of midnight ET on December 31, 2020. Taxpayers who
can't fax file their Forms 1139 or 1045 should follow the filing
instructions on the forms.
