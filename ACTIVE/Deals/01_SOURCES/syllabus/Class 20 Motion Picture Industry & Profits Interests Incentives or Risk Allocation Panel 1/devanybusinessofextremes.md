Part IV

A business of extremes

The movie business is right up there with earthquakes and hurricanes when
it comes to the inﬂuence of extreme events. They are about as predictable
too. Movies, hurricanes, earthquakes, ﬂoods, stock market returns, innovations and patents, and just about any really important phenomenon in human
affairs are almost completely unpredictable. They are unpredictable because
they all follow the “wild” statistics of a Pareto Lévy stable distribution. This
distribution seems to capture the complex dynamics of processes that are
driven by extreme events and that lack any characteristic scale or size. Just as
there is no typical hurricane or earthquake, there is no typical movie. And,
just as the damage from ﬂoods or returns in the stock market are driven by
big events, so are revenues and returns in motion pictures.
Here is a little thought experiment I do with my movie class to demonstrate
the inﬂuence of extreme events. There are, say, 50 students in the class and
their average weight is about 148 pounds (it has risen in recent years and
not because my weight has changed). Their total weight is 7,400 pounds.
The next person to walk into the class weighs 200 and the average rises to
149. Then a 100 pounder enters and the weight falls back to 148. Not much
change even though the weights of the new additions differ by a factor of two.
So far we have been talking about a Gaussian process where people are rather
typical and extreme variations in weight are unusual. So the average tends to
settle down and converge to a stationary value. The movies are not like that.
You have to imagine that the next entrant into the class is a 9,000-pound
gorilla. Now the average more than doubles to 315 pounds. And that student
may be followed by a 20,000-pound lizard who brings the average up to
680 pounds. Then a ten pounder walks in and the average drops to 667. We
are up to 55 students and two of them, a gorilla and giant lizard, account for
about 80 percent of the total weight in the room; they completely dominate
the average. That is the essence of the movies.
As you will see in Chapter 10 of this next group of chapters, about 5 percent
of movies earn close to 80 percent of motion picture proﬁt. The Pareto law
of revenues has a grip on the movies where a bit less than 20 percent earn
80 percent of revenues (Chapters 2, 4 and 5). This is a consequence of the
skew of the Pareto Lévy stable distribution; there are a lot of small movies

208 A business of extremes
and a few big ones, but the big ones are far more probable than the Gaussian
distribution would say they are. While the Gaussian distribution is symmetrical
and smoothly peaked, with a mean at the center, the Pareto stable distribution
is sharply peaked and asymmetric. Its mean is usually far from the center. It’s
heavy tails, sharp peak and skewed, asymmetric shape make it a statistical
monstrosity; it suffers from a condition called leptokurtosis.
But, leptokurtosis is not a condition requiring mouth wash or antideordorant. It is a thing of beauty. It is what makes the movies what they are.
Without kurtosis, there would be no Gone with the Wind and there would be
no aristocracy in Hollywood. The business would be more like dentistry or
warehousing.
What produces the exotic form of kurtosis we see in the movies is the
nonlinear dynamic that shapes audiences; this, and the fact that a movie can
be almost indeﬁnitely repeated. Additional moviegoers are readily accommodated and each viewer leaves no less of the ﬁlm for others to see. This inﬁnite
reproducibility permits the nonlinear dynamic to take revenues to extreme
values which gives the distribution its leptokurtotic shape.
The nonlinear dynamics of preferences and movie revenues is apparent in
other areas beside revenues and proﬁt. Consider the nonlinear co-evolution
of tastes and movies. When you see a violent movie, this conditions you; you
begin to tolerate and expect violence. Small differences among movies are
ampliﬁed by nonlinearity so that a more violent movie that exceeds expectations sets itself apart and may earn large amounts. This leads producers to
new violence in order to exceed expectations. Again, these small differences
in violence among movies are magniﬁed at the box-ofﬁce and a new tolerance forms. The audience, its expectations and the motives of the producers
to exceed them spirals the movies into the depths of depravity and bloody,
gratuitous violence. Nobody planned it and people wonder how it ended up
like this; nonlinear processes can produce grotesque outcomes and they are
hard to get out of.
It takes a shock or a nonlinear process to get out of these traps. Happily,
the nonlinear dynamic can go the other way. Suppose a nonviolent, charming movie with interesting dialogue is a hit. Producers may think this is the
next big thing and make more of these movies. Moviegoers begin to expect
and appreciate this type of movie. They become more adept at dialogue and
small differences among ﬁlms translate into large differences in revenues. Producers race to ﬁnd writers who can do better dialogue. The audience comes
to expect snappy dialogue and rewards the ﬁlm that exceeds their expectations. With each round, the dialogue gets better. Suddenly movies now are
all about dialogue and interesting characters rather than violent, inarticulate aliens and killers. It could happen; nonlinear feedback produces extreme
outcomes. If only.
Is it chaos that makes the movies a business of extremes? Chaos is the result
of nonlinear and possibly deterministic dynamics that takes points near one
another apart exponentially rapidly. Chaos magniﬁes small differences into

extreme differences. It says that, even if we could write down the equations
that determine how the week-to-week changes in box-ofﬁce revenues behave
during a ﬁlm’s run (we can’t, nobody can in spite of the forecasts you read
in the paper and the studio’s belief that it can be done), we will never know
how it will come out.
Why this is so lies in the sensitivity to initial conditions. Small differences
in the box-ofﬁce take in the ﬁrst weekend or week among ﬁlms can be rapidly
magniﬁed by the nonlinearity of the information ﬂow. Film A grosses more
than Film B. This is reported on the evening news. People choose A over B.
The difference grows. And so on. Pretty soon A can be a hit and B a dog.
But, it could have gone the other way. Due to random circumstances B
might have outgrossed A. The audience then chooses B over A and their
separation grows with each media report. Now B is the hit and A is the dog.
Fortunately, it is not quite like that, but this is how it would be if the process
were deterministic chaos. The funny thing about chaos is that it is completely
deterministic—chance plays no role—even though chaos leads to outcomes so
bizarre that they appear to be completely random. In the movies, the source
of wild outcomes is the nonlinear, expansive dynamic information processing
of the movie audience.
So, Hollywood is not in chaos, though it may often look that way. It is
a nonlinear business that is driven to extremes. There is a kind of order in
everything though and demonstrating that somewhat hidden order is the
burden of the chapters that follow in this last Part of the book.
Chapter 10 is another work by David Walls and myself on the statistical
attractors to which the complex dynamics of movie revenue and production
converge. Chapter 11 is a paper I wrote just for this book about actors and
directors. Chapter 12 is also original to this book. In it I go beyond chaos to
complexity to show that all we have so-far learned about the movies and all we
may love about them fall into a framework called complex systems analysis.
In Chapter 10, David and I propose, test and estimate the general asymmetric stable distribution as a model of motion picture proﬁt. We show that
the skew of this distribution and its Paretian tails capture with great ﬁdelity
the statistics of the movies. The model implies that the movie business is fundamentally more risky than a Gaussian world. Features of the business such
as the “nobody knows principle,” the “curse of the superstar,” the “angel’s
nightmare,” the instability of proﬁt, and the form of artist contracts are shown
to follow from the asymmetry of the stable distribution.
In the discussion on directors and actors in Chapter 11, I show that one
can distinguish between luck and talent, but the difference is smaller than
one might imagine. A hit–ﬂop coin toss explains many of the features of
artists’ careers. It is only among the most productive artistes that one begins
to see a distinction between pure luck and talent. A remarkable self-similarity
is uncovered in three measures of director performance: the number of ﬁlms
they make, their revenues and their pay. Self-similarity is another form of the
“nobody knows” principle that has ﬁgured so prominantly in earlier chapters.

210 A business of extremes
If you don’t know anything, then how do you pay a director or an actor? I
examine a bidding process for signing top actors to show that several problems
lead producers to overpay top stars. They face a “winners curse” that is a
well-known problem in auctions. They face the curse of the superstar that
we will see in Chapter 10. They also face the problem of estimating the
probabilities of outcomes for their movie with each potential leading star,
an almost unsurmountable task. Producers are also up against the sure thing
principle.
But, there is a better way to do it. To solve the problem of what to pay
a star when you don’t know, the producer should wait until he does know.
The producer should pay when he does know, after the ﬁlm has run. The
truth of this proposition is established by Darlene Chishom’s research and by
new evidence that I develop in Chapter 11. Using a sample of director contracts, I show that contracts condition pay on outcomes far into the tail of the
distribution. I call this contracting in the tails and show that the conditioning events are of vanishing Gaussian probability. The contracts are, therefore,
completely at odds with the standard theory of contracts. Directors and their
agents seem to know that they operate in a stable Paretian world and design
their contracts accordingly.
In Chapter 12 of this Part, I draw together the results of all this research
and look for a more general model that can reveal the structure that lies just
out of sight from an ordinary view. I use complex systems theory to show the
deep order of the movies; here too, self-similarity plays a large role.
