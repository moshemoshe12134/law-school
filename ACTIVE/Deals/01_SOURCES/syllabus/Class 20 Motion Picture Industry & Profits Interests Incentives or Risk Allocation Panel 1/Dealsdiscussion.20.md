**Problem 20: Profits Interests: Incentives or Risk Allocation? (Panel
1)**

1.  Information and Incentives: Studios and Theater Owners

    a.  Studio, a film distributor, is negotiating a deal to distribute
        a movie. Tom, who owns a theater, contracts with Studio to show
        the movie. Under their standard contract, does Tom pay a fixed
        fee to Studio for the film? Or does Studio pay a fixed fee to
        rent the theater? Or something else? What is the usual
        arrangement? According to Goldberg, what is the reason for this?

    <!-- -->

    a.  Like other standard deals, Tom's contract with Studio has a
        provision that changes over the course of a movie's "run" in his
        theater. What is this change? What explanation does Goldberg
        offer for it? Is his explanation about information, incentives,
        or something else?

    b.  Tina, who owns a small independent theater, strikes a different
        deal than Tom. She will get the movie late in its run. According
        to Goldberg, is she likely to receive a fixed fee? Or to pay a
        fixed fee? Why?

    c.  Talia owns a large and luxurious theater in Big City. The studio
        strikes a special deal to "four wall" it for the beginning of
        the movie's run. According to Goldberg, is she likely to receive
        a fixed fee? Or to pay a fixed fee? Why?

    d.  Franco is a foreign subdistributor. According to Goldberg, what
        kind of deal is he likely to strike with the studio? What are
        the three components of the deal?

    e.  Why does this structure serve the parties' interests? What
        effect does it have on their incentives?

    f.  What information problem does it solve? Why does Goldberg
        compare it with an M&A deal with an earnout?

2.  Incentives: Profits Interests, Writers, and Producers

    a.  Peter, a producer who works for Studio, negotiates a net profit
        interest with Wilma, a young screenwriter. You are a college
        friend of Wilma's parents, and a Hollywood veteran. At her
        parents' suggestion, Wilma meets you for coffee to ask for your
        advice. She asks you why Studio recovers all its costs first, so
        that she shares in profits only after the breakeven point.

        i.  According to Goldberg, what is the rationale for this? What
            incentive does it create for Studio?

        ii. Wilma asks whether Peter also gets a net profit
            participation, and you confirm that he probably does, given
            the standard contract structure in Hollywood. You also
            mention that Peter is likely to have an "overbudget penalty
            clause." What is that? According to Goldberg, what function
            does the clause and Peter's net participation serve?

        iii. "This is my second movie. My first did well, so I'm getting
             \$50,000 for this script, which is a lot more than the
             \$10,000 that I got for my first script. Obviously, that's
             good news," she says. "They also are giving me a net
             participation, but my friends tell me that it's unlikely to
             pay off in the end." Is she right? What does Goldberg say
             about that?

        iv. "The net profits formula is really unfavorable to me," Wilma
            says. "My friends say that this is just a sign that Peter
            drives a hard bargain. Studios will cheat us whenever they
            can, right?" Do you agree that bargaining power explains the
            net profits formula? (Hint: Goldberg is skeptical about
            that. Why?)

        v.  In predicting whether Wilma's net participation will yield a
            generous payment, you obviously need to make a judgment
            about whether the movie will be successful. Assume for the
            moment that it will be (a strong assumption, to be sure, but
            please make it anyway). For you to advise Wilma about her
            chances of getting paid, what question should you ask her?
            What else do you need to know? (Hint: This information is
            not about Wilma, but about other people.)

    b.  Incentives: Interaction of Net and Gross Profit Participations

        i.  Three weeks later, Wilma calls you and says, "Peter has just
            signed a really big name--Alicia Actress--as the star of the
            movie, but I'm not sure whether to be happy or sad about
            this." What is the downside for Wilma?

        ii. "Keep in mind that Peter is in the same boat as you," you
            respond. "In any event, I still think this is good news for
            you (and for Peter as well)." Please explain your statement.
            (Hint: Goldberg supplies the answer.)

        iii. Don't Alicia's gross points reduce Peter's incentive to
             control costs and do his best work? According to Goldberg,
             why is Studio willing to dilute Peter's incentive in this
             way?

        iv. After the production of the movie is complete, what
            additional steps can Alicia take to help it succeed? How, if
            at all, does a gross participation motivate her to take this
            step?

        v.  A film without a big star like Alicia can't depend on the
            step in "i" to generate interest in the movie. According to
            Goldberg, when this is the case, whose efforts become more
            important in marketing it? Does the typical deal structure
            for a deal without a big star create the right incentives
            for others to step in and do more?

        vi. Does Goldberg think that the use and structure of net and
            gross participations can be explained mainly as a response
            to incentive problems or to asymmetric information?

        vii. Wilma calls you up a year later. "My last movie was a big
             hit, but my net participation didn't pay off. I'm pretty
             annoyed about that," she says. "Peter (who produced that
             movie) just called me, asking me to do another script. He's
             offering me \$100,000 for it and another net
             participation." After you congratulate her, she poses a
             question: "This time, should I insist that the studio can't
             grant anyone a gross participation?" What is your advice
             for Wilma? Why might this strategy backfire? (Hint: Again,
             Goldberg supplies the answer.)

        viii. Studio makes Wilma and Peter "pay or play" on the movie.
              What does this mean? What kind of option does this give
              Studio? (Hint: we used this term in our discussions of
              venture capital.)

3.  Monitoring and Incentives

    a.  Paula, a producer, is negotiating to sign Andrew, an
        up-and-coming actor, to work on a movie. The movie will be
        directed by Delia, a prominent and experienced director. Andrew
        receives a net participation. Does he need it to be properly
        motivated to do a good job? One potential rationale would be
        that his effort is not observable. If others can't tell whether
        he is really trying, he needs to be self-motivated. But can't
        Delia (the director) tell whether Andrew is making an effort and
        doing a good job? Also, doesn't Andrew have other financial
        incentives to do his best work? What is Weinstein's view on this
        issue?

    b.  Ned, whose novel is being adapted for the screen to make this
        movie, is also receiving a net participation. Ned wrote the
        novel five years ago, and someone else is writing the
        screenplay. How important is it to motivate Ned to do good work?
        Is the rationale for his net participation an incentive-based
        rationale? What is Weinstein's view?

    c.  In the studio era, actors were permanent employees at studios.
        But since the studio era ended, they are hired only for a
        specific picture. According to Weinstein, what effect, if any,
        does this change have on an actor's incentives to do her best
        work on a given movie?

4.  Risk and Incentives

    a.  Do Goldberg and Weinstein have the same or different views about
        the function of net and gross participations?

    b.  Compared with Goldberg, is Weinstein more or less persuaded of
        the importance of motivating actors, directors, and others to do
        their best work? Does he have a different theory about how to
        motivate them?

    c.  Hollywood studios generally are part of publicly traded
        companies. Their shareholders usually are diversified. So if
        studios are run to serve the interests of shareholders,
        shouldn't they be risk neutral?

    d.  According to Weinstein, why might studios behave as if they are
        risk averse? What kind of incentive problem (which we have
        encountered before) can cause this behavior?

    e.  What risk-related function does Weinstein attribute to net and
        gross participations?

    f.  When Paula negotiates with Andrew and Delia to hire them to work
        on the movie, what information might Paula have that they don't
        have? Conversely, what information might they have that Paula
        doesn't have? According to Weinstein, how (if at all) can net or
        gross profit participations help to bridge this information
        asymmetry?

    g.  If the success of movies is hard to predict, one possible
        response is that producers and talent will invest time and
        effort in making better predictions. Alternatively, another
        response is to use profit-sharing contracts. According to
        Weinstein, how can net and gross participations help the parties
        respond to uncertainty?

5.  Dan is a director, and he is negotiating with Paula, a producer who
    is the head of Studio, about whether he will direct *Hit Movie*.

    a.  A key question is how important Dan's effort is in making the
        movie a success. If Dan just goes through the motions--not
        motivating the actors, not keeping the filming on schedule, and
        not trying to be creative in the way the movie is filmed--will
        his lack of effort impede the movie's success?

    b.  Assume that Dan is extremely motivated, tirelessly and
        energetically doing everything he can to improve the movie's
        quality and to get it done on time and under budget. According
        to Arthur De Vany, do his efforts guarantee that the movie will
        be successful?

    c.  Alan and Ann are actors who are the stars of *Hit Movie*. Let's
        consider the same question. How important is their effort? If
        they don't try, will their lack of effort scuttle the movie?
        According to De Vany, if they do try, will their efforts
        guarantee success?

    d.  Paula is considering whether to pay Dan, Alan, and Ann with a
        fixed salary only, or to supplement their salary with pay based
        on the movie's performance.

        i.  If Paula believes that Dan, Alan, and Ann's efforts are
            important to the success of the movie, is that an argument
            to use incentive compensation?

        ii. True or false: If the goal of contingent compensation is to
            motivate the talent to do better work, the condition that
            triggers the compensation need to be chosen carefully: the
            talent should be rewarded for effort and for adding value,
            and the reward should be withheld when they don't do a good
            job.

        iii. Do "net profits" interests seem like they are set in the
             right way to reward the talent's effort? Why or why not?

        iv. What about "gross participations"? Compared with net
            participations, do they seem better calibrated--or not as
            well calibrated--to reward Dan, Alan, and Ann's efforts?

6.  Before Paula negotiates contracts with Dan, Alan, and Ann, and the
    rest of the team, she meets with Arthur De Vany.

    a.  In the course of the meeting, De Vany describes his thought
        experiment involving the weight of students in his class. What
        is the thought experiment? What is his point?

    b.  De Vany also repeats a line from today's reading: "About 5
        percent of movies earn close to 80 percent of motion picture
        profit." Should this fact influence how Paula thinks about
        incentive compensation? To what extent does effort determine
        whether a movie ends up being in the top five percent of
        earners?

    c.  Recognizing the extremely broad range of potential box office
        results, Paula says to De Vany, "That's why it's so important to
        motivate the talent." How do you think De Vany would respond?

    d.  De Vany argues that it's very hard to predict which movies will
        be the top 5% grossing movies. Part of the reason, he says, has
        to do with the demand for a specific movie. What shapes it? How
        predictable are these "nonlinear" factors?

    e.  According to De Vany, part of the reason why movie revenue is
        unpredictable has to do with supply. Once a movie has been made,
        how costly is it to show it to more people?

    f.  During his meeting with Paula, De Vany repeats another line from
        the reading today: "If you don't know anything, then how do you
        pay a director or an actor?" What is De Vany's answer?

    g.  In light of your answer to "f," is De Vany recommending
        contingent compensation--such as net and gross
        participations--as a way to motivate talent?

    h.  Is De Vany's analysis more like Goldberg's or Weinstein's view?
