PROFIT-SHARING CONTRACTS IN
HOLLYWOOD: EVOLUTION AND ANALYSIS
MARK WEINSTEIN*

Abstract
This article examines the development of profit- or revenue-sharing contracts in
the motion picture industry. Contrary to much popular belief, such contracts have
been in use since the start of the studio era. However, early contracts differed from
those seen today. The evolution of the current contract is traced, and evidence regarding the increased use of sharing contracts after 1948 is examined. I examine
competing theories of the economic function served by these contracts. I suggest
that it is unlikely that these contracts are the result of a standard principal-agent
problem.

I. Introduction

O
ne of my colleagues has suggested that the second-easiest way to start
a fight at a pool party on the west side of Los Angeles is to argue in favor
of the two propositions presented in this article: (1) ‘‘net-profits’’ contracts
as used in Hollywood have been in use for more than 60 years, and (2)
these contracts are reasonable responses to contracting problems that arise
in the motion picture industry. Litigation about employment contracts in

THE JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES

Hollywood is widely reported.1 These suits are usually brought by people
who had contracted for a share of the ‘‘net profits’’ from a movie. After
the movie is, arguably, successful, the individual discovers that the ‘‘net
profits’’ are small and perhaps zero. The common perception is that the studios use strange and arcane accounting practices to eliminate any profit. A
contrast is often drawn between those who have little bargaining power—
such as Art Buchwald—and sign contracts with ‘‘net-profit’’ shares and big
stars—such as Tom Hanks—who are able to sign for shares of the
‘‘gross.’’ The latter are believed to be unaffected by studio chicanery. Indeed, the fact that some major stars get a percentage of the gross is considered one of the reasons the ‘‘net profits’’ are reduced.2 These claims are
appealing to the public. The plaintiff is usually an individual who had profit
participation in a movie that has turned out to have large box office. How
can Batman, or Forest Gump, not be profitable? In reality, however, the
term ‘‘net profits,’’ as used in Hollywood to define a contingent compensation contract, is unrelated to ‘‘net profits’’ as defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. ‘‘Net profits’’ is a contractually defined term,
the meaning of which is well understood in the industry as this contractual
form has been common within it since at least the mid-1950s.3 Moreover,
it is similar to contractual forms in use since the 1920s as the integrated
production-distribution-exhibition corporation that epitomized the ‘‘studio
system’’ developed. It is difficult to see how a one-sided contractual form
would survive such a long period.
This article examines the evolution of profit- or revenue-sharing contracts
in the movies. There has been virtually no analysis of the economics of the
motion picture industry or the contract forms used in the industry. Most
who have written about the contracts used in the motion picture industry
have either been reporters, film historians, or legal professionals.4 Thus, one

Garrison v Warner Brothers, et al (USDC, Cent Dist Cal 1996). Further, it was widely reported that Winston Groom, the author of the book on which the movie Forest Gump was
based, felt that he was not getting payments to which he was entitled (Nina Munk, Now You

of the objectives of this article is to present an analysis of the evolution of
various sharing contracts used in Hollywood. I argue that the evolution is,
in part, the result of changes in the economic and regulatory environment
in which the studios do business. That is, as the underlying economics and
industrial organization of the industry changed, the contract that best balanced the costs and benefits changed.
I proceed in the following manner. First, I present an overview of the
motion picture industry and some evidence on the historic performance of
the studios. The third section describes current sharing contracts in motion
pictures and their historical development. I also point out that some aspects
of the contract that were ruled unconscionable in the Buchwald decision in
fact make it possible for participants to audit reasonably the payments they
receive, thereby ensuring that the studio is keeping its side of the bargain.
The fourth section examines the potential economic rationales for these
contracts. In fact, there are two issues that call for the application of economic reasoning. First, there is the question why sharing contracts are used
at all. That is, why does a presumably risk-averse individual take a contract
that involves an uncertain payoff ? There is, then, a second question, which
is why a particular contract form is used. There are a number of competing
hypotheses regarding these contracts. First, there is what I term the ‘‘ripoff’’ theory, to which I have already alluded. I argue that this is not an
attractive rationale. In contrast to this view are a variety of analyses in
which the contracts are the result of rational behavior. While others5 have
analyzed the contract using a fairly standard principal-agent framework, I
am dubious about that view. Rather, I propose that these contracts serve
two potential roles.
First, the contracts may represent a risk-sharing device in which some of
the risk of a movie is borne by those who sign these sharing contracts. This
(Cambridge University Press, 3d ed 1986)) or have concerned themselves with the Paramount decision and its fallout (for example, Arthur DeVany & Ross Eckert, Motion Picture
Antitrust: The Paramount Cases Revisited, 14 Res L & Econ 51 (1991); Roy Kenney and
Benjamn Klein, The Economics of Block Booking, 26 J Law & Econ 497 (1983); George
Stigler, A Note on Block Booking, in The Organization of Industry 165 (1968)). The only
economic analyses that focus on these contracts are the work of Darlene Chisholm (Darlene
Chisholm, Asset Specificity and Long-Term Contracts: The Case of the Motion-Pictures Industry, 19 E Econ J 143 (1993); Darlene Chisholm, The Risk-Premium Hypothesis and TwoPart Tariff Contract Design: Some Empirical Evidence (Working Paper No 94-28, Massachusetts Inst Technology, Dept Economics 1994); Darlene Chisholm, Profit-Sharing versus
Fixed-Payment Contracts: Evidence from the Motion-Pictures Industry, 13 J L Econ & Org
169 (1997)). After this article was substantially complete, I became aware of Victor Goldberg, The Net Profits Puzzle 97 Colum L Rev 524 (1997). The only economic analysis of
the unpredictability of box office of which I am aware is Arthur DeVany and W. David
Walls, Bose-Einstein Dynamics and Adaptive Contracting in the Motion Picture Industry,
106 Econ J (1996).

risk sharing may be optimal if the studio executive who signs the contract
is risk-averse (either because of risk aversion or because of a problem in
the contract between the executive and the firm) or if it goes hand in glove
with a reduced fixed payment to the ‘‘talent.’’ In a studio, as in any large
business, executives are often given a fixed budget with which to work and
so often have an incentive to convert fixed costs (salaries) to variable costs
(shares of receipts). That is, there are two reasons that behavior that appears
to be due to risk aversion may arise. First, studio executives may actually
be risk-averse in a way that affects the contracts they write. Alternatively,
as a result of the costs of monitoring studio executives, a system of fixed
budgets for motion picture production may provide an incentive for studio
executives to reduce the fixed component of compensation by offering contingent compensation that, by definition, is risky.
Second, these contracts may serve to solve an asymmetric information
problem between the studio and the actor. The actor may have private information about how interested he is in making this particular movie, and the
studio may have private information about the likely success of the movie.
In this case, a sharing contract may provide protection against the informationally advantaged party. These two hypotheses have not been previously
developed in the literature concerning movie contracts. While these explanations are more relevant for those with more bargaining power, most of
the litigation has been about those with relatively little bargaining power
who sign what are called ‘‘net-profits’’ contracts. I present some analysis
of their situation in the fourth section.
In summary, this article (1) documents the long history of this contract
form and presents evidence on its evolution, (2) suggests that the most common theories why these contracts exist are probably not valid, and (3) suggests some alternative hypotheses that are more consistent with industry
practice.
II. The Motion Picture Industry
There are three well-defined stages in the motion picture business: production, distribution, and exhibition. Production involves making a completed master of the motion picture that is to be distributed and exhibited.
This is a complicated process requiring the input of a myriad of talented
people and fairly large sums of money.6 The production of a movie is or6
The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) reports that in 1995 the average
film released through an MPAA member (which includes virtually all firms of any stature in
the industry) had a ‘‘negative cost’’–the cost of making the master negative—of $36.3 million. The average cost for prints, promotion, and advertising was about $17.7 million, for a
total expense of $54 million. Motion Picture Association members released 234 of the 419
films in that year and virtually all films with sizable box office. The aggregate box office for

chestrated by a ‘‘producer’’ who may or may not be the person with the
‘‘Produced by’’ credit on the film.
Distribution takes as input the completed motion picture master from the
producer. The distributor makes positive prints from the master and places
them in the hands of the exhibitors. The distributor manages the physical
flow of potentially thousands of copies of the movie, arranges promotional
activities, and collects the moneys due from the exhibitors. The distributor
also forwards some of the moneys collected to individuals associated with
the movie.
Exhibition refers to showing the movie to patrons. An exhibitor firm
takes as inputs a copy of a completed motion picture, a movie theater that
it builds or leases, and the various labor inputs (ticket takers, ushers, projectionists, etc.) to produce seats at a showing of a movie. These seats are then
sold to the public. As the structure of the industry has changed over time,
some historical perspective is useful for readers who are not familiar with it.
The industry has gone through three main phases. Prior to about 1915,
the industry was dominated by a large number of production companies
that, for the most part, paid royalties to the trust that controlled all of the
essential patents associated with moviemaking. At the same time, there was
a set of smaller, independent production companies that operated outside of
the trust. During the period from about 1915 to 1930 the industry became
organized around a small number of vertically integrated firms that provided production, distribution, and exhibition. While many of the major
stars had their own production companies before the rise of the ‘‘studio system,’’ by the 1930s most, though not all, stars were salaried employees of
the studios. The studio system ended with the Paramount decision in the
late 1940s,7 which forced the separation of exhibition from production and
distribution. During the 1950s the studios evolved into what they are today,
essentially distribution companies that provide financing to some producers
(‘‘studio productions’’), provide distribution services for independent producers under long-term contract, and pick up partly or fully completed
movies for distribution.
One way to get a feel for how the industry has performed over time is
to examine the output and revenues of the industry. In Table 1 I present the
number of movies released by the major studios during the sound era up to
1980. During the period 1930–42 the major studios released an average of
all films was $5.5 billion. Even if I assume that all box office went to MPAA films, the
average domestic box office was only $23.5 million. Because the exhibitor returns roughly
50 percent of the box office to the studio, average studio gross from domestic theatrical distribution is less than $12 million per picture.

over the period 1943–45. After the war, output fluctuated in the late 1940s
and then declined as the advent of television and changing demographics
reduced demand. This is shown by the average output of only 119 movies
over the 1971–80 period. Figure 1 presents data on attendance and revenues
for the major studios over the same period and tells a similar story with a
significant decline in attendance and (real) revenues in the 1950s. I return

write, in Section IVA1.
III.

Contracting in Hollywood

Net and gross participation contracts evolved over time. While it is a
commonly held view that such participations are a recent development, this
is not the case. As long as there have been studios, those with sufficient
talent and bargaining power have been participating in the success of their
movies. I start with an examination of a typical ‘‘net-profits’’ contract, the
one that was the subject of the Buchwald litigation. Next, I summarize the
most common forms of contingent compensation that currently exist. I then
turn to the changes in the form of the participation contracts that occurred
as the studio era ended in an effort to trace the development of the contract
form.

PROFIT-SHARING CONTRACTS IN HOLLYWOOD

75

A. The Buchwald Contract
The Buchwald contract is typical of the net-profits participation contracts
that were written by the major studios in the mid-1980s. In 1983, Alain
Bernheim contracted with Paramount Pictures Corporation for the possible
development of a movie based on an idea of Art Buchwald’s. This contract
is a standard ‘‘net-profits’’ contract for a major studio production in the
early 1980s.8 A sharing contract in Hollywood defines two things. First, it
defines a pool of funds from which a participation is to be paid, and second,
it defines the percentage of that pool that will go to the contracting party.
Pool definitions generally fall into either of two categories, gross receipts
or net profits.
The contract defines the gross receipts of the picture as the amount received by the distributor from various sources. Traditionally, the main
source of revenues was that part of the box-office receipts (roughly 50 percent) that the theater rebates to the distributor. Other forms of exhibition
(pay TV, network TV) are also accounted for, as is income from videocassette sales, which has come to be as important as theatrical income.9 Some
individuals with sufficient bargaining power contract to share in the movie’s gross receipts. While this participation may be from the first dollar of
gross receipts (‘‘first-dollar gross’’), more often it is triggered by the gross
achieving some predetermined dollar level or a multiple of the direct costs
of production of the picture.10
The transformation of ‘‘gross receipts’’ to ‘‘net profits’’ requires subtracting a number of expense items. These fall into four categories. First,
there are the distribution fees and expenses. These include (1) the distribution fee (30 percent United States and Canada, 35 percent the United Kingdom, and 40 percent elsewhere), (2) direct advertising and publicity expenses, (3) the cost of prints, and (4) overhead charges of 10 percent of
direct ad and publicity costs. Next are the costs of getting the master print
created. These include (1) the direct costs of production (the ‘‘negative
cost’’), which includes all development and production costs, including all
8
Without commenting on how representative the contracts are, the complaint in Garrison
(cited in note 1) presents net-profits definitions from each of the major studios and a table
comparing their terms.
9
As with merchandising, the movie’s gross is credited with a percentage of the revenues
from videocassette sales, rather than crediting all the revenues to the gross and later then
deducting all the costs. In effect, the studio contracts to ‘‘sell’’ the videocassette rights for a
20 percent royalty. Often, the ‘‘purchaser’’ of the videocassette rights is the studio, or an
affiliate.
10
There are some small items subtracted from the gross receipts such as trade dues, contributions to the MPAA, and so forth. I have been told that roughly 20 performers and five
directors are able to get ‘‘first-dollar’’ gross, although that number appears to be on the rise.

76

gross participations,11 (2) the overhead charge, which is specified as 15 percent of the cost of production (including gross participations), and (3) interest expense. Paramount subtracts from the revenues interest on the direct
production and overhead at the rate of 125 percent of prime. While the interest is stated last, in fact it is recovered before any production costs are
credited. That is, if any funds from gross revenues remain in an accounting
period after paying of gross participations and the distribution-related expenses, those funds are first used to pay off the outstanding interest bill, and
only after the interest is covered do they go to pay down the negative
costs.12 Thus, the ‘‘net profit’’ is zero until the movie has recovered all the
costs of distribution, the overhead and the direct negative cost, and interest
charges on the negative costs and overhead.13
The studio’s revenues, then, come from four sources: (1) the studio receives a distribution fee which is a percentage of the revenues of the movie;
(2) the studio recovers its direct expenses for prints and advertising and an
overhead on advertising; (3) the studio recovers the direct costs of production, along with an overhead charge and an ‘‘interest’’ charge on the resources advances in making the movie; and, finally, (4) the studio usually
maintains a share of the net-profits pool.
Thus a negative net-profits pool does not mean that the studio has not
made a profit on the movie as computed under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or even an economic profit. For example, for the purposes of financial reporting, there is no ‘‘interest’’ cost if the studio is financed entirely with equity, though to an economist the opportunity cost of
capital is a cost of doing business. Alternatively, the actual expenses for
those items that are classified as overhead may differ from that specified in
the contract. Moreover, the distribution fee, which is deducted before the
computation of ‘‘net profit,’’ is a revenue source to the studio.
One way to understand this contract is to look at it in the light of the
services provided by the modern studio. Consider an individual who has an
idea for a motion picture. In order to actually make and distribute the
11
Thus, for the purposes of computing the ‘‘net profit,’’ there is no distinction between
compensation paid as salary and compensation paid as a result of ‘‘gross’’ participation.
There is also a proviso that no expense can be counted as both a distribution and a production
expense (‘‘no double deductions’’).
12
This is similar to the amortization of a loan in which the current payment is first applied
to the interest and only if there are funds left over after bringing the interest up to date is
the remainder applied to principal.
13
Although contracts written on the gross appear different from contracts written on the
net-profits pool, one can always convert a ‘‘net-profits’’ contract into a contract written on
the gross receipts. Of course, it will not be written on ‘‘first-dollar’’ gross, but rather the
contingent payment will be delayed until some multiple of production and distribution costs
are recovered.

movie, she has two choices. On the one hand, she can avoid the studio completely. In that case, she must arrange financing, develop the idea into a
script, hire a director, arrange for the actual production of the movie, and,
finally, engage a distributor to distribute the motion picture. On the other
hand, she can arrange for a studio to provide financing and other services.
The producer, if she has little or no track record, might well end up with
terms similar to that of Alain Bernheim in this case—an up-front payment
and a percentage of the ‘‘net profits.’’ In return, the studio finances all the
costs of production, arranges for the resources needed to produce the film,
and then distributes it.
If studio’s charges, including the interest rate and the distribution fee, are
those that rule in a competitive market, then the producer should not prefer
to produce the movie herself. The studio is providing an array of services
and charging market rates for them for them. Given the ease of contracting
for services, the ‘‘one-stop shopping’’ nature of a studio production may
even offer a sufficient benefit such that the studio’s charges need not meet
the market rate for each service in order to remain competitive.14
In Buchwald, some of aspects of the contract that Judge Schneider found
unconscionable were charging a fixed, predetermined overhead on production costs and advertising expenses, charging production overhead and interest on payments to gross participants, and charging interest at the rate of
125 percent of prime, rather than at Paramount’s actual cost of funds. I believe that the judge was wrong in all of these cases. In any contract like
this, which calls for some sharing of cash flows, there must be some way
for the receiving party (in this case the performer or producer) to ensure
herself that she is being paid in full. Further, the payer (the studio) may not
want to reveal everything about its operations to the payee. The three
clauses of the contract described above make it possible to audit the contract to ensure proper compliance without requiring the studio to divulge
expenses or revenues for any other movie.
First, the overhead allocation on the both the production cost and on the
advertising expense is structured as a predetermined function of direct expenses. This is in contrast to normal cost accounting. Under normal cost
accounting practices, the overhead for a given picture depends on how costs
are allocated across all of the pictures in a given year, and the negative cost
14
Actually, even if the studio simply charges market rates for its services, professionals
may be willing to contract on different terms for a production that is backed by a studio than
for one without studio backing. A leading star, for example, is more confident that the movie
will actually be finished and distributed and hence may not require as much pay. Even those
with relatively little bargaining power may work for less on a studio production because they
do not bear the risk of noncompletion or difficulties with payment for services. Thus, the
backing of a major studio, per se, may reduce costs.

78

THE JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES

used in computing the contingent compensation would be a function of how
many other productions were going on at the time. This means that it would
be to the participant’s advantage to have many other pictures under production to which overhead can be allocated. Moreover, auditing the contingent
payment requires knowing the negative cost, which, in turn, requires knowing the costs of each movie produced in a given year. Thus it would be
costly for the participant to ensure that she is getting the appropriate payment, and the studio would be required to reveal information on other movies. This means that if contracts did not predetermine an overhead percentage, there might be no effective audit right for the participant. In the
modern contract, of which Buchwald’s is representative, detailed allocation
of common costs is not required. This is in contrast to similar contracts
from the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, which specified overhead charges as determined by the studio’s accounting firm.
Because the gross participation payments are included in the negative
cost of the movie, both overhead and interest are charged on them. Charging overhead on gross participation payments serves to provide, ex ante, the
appropriate amount of overhead. This may seem odd. After all, how can the
studio charge 15 percent overhead simply for writing a check? However, to
the extent that the gross participation is a substitute for salary, adding the
participation to the production costs makes sense. The purpose of the overhead allocation is to capture those costs associated with a given picture that
are difficult and/or expensive to track. These are probably related to the
‘‘scale’’ of the movie. If a performer receives a gross participation, the
fixed component of his salary understates his total compensation, and this
leads to an understatement of the ‘‘scale’’ of the movie.15 Including the participation in the base on which overhead is calculated offsets this bias. Further, it is reasonable to assume that an actor is more willing to take a participation rather than salary on a movie that has the backing of a major studio
(the picture is more likely to actually get made and distributed, and when
distributed it will have the support of a major studio distribution system).
Then one can easily imagine that, had the producer not had the support of
the studio, she would have had to pay the star a larger salary during the
cost of production and would have had to raise the funds for those payments. Thus the interest charge on the gross participation is simply a mechanism for the studio to capture the economic benefit that it provides to the
producer.
15
One problem with this view is that it implies that there should also be overhead charged
on contingent payments made to ‘‘net-profits’’ participants. This could lead to circularity
problems in the definition of net profits, and a similar result can be obtained by changing the
percentage overhead charge to take this failure into account.

PROFIT-SHARING CONTRACTS IN HOLLYWOOD

79

Finally, there is the fact that the financing charge is a predetermined
function of the prime rate and is not related to the studio’s cost of funds.
However, it does not make economic sense to tie the interest rate to the
interest rate the studio pays for borrowed funds. First, what would happen
if a studio had no net financing, was flush with cash? That would not mean
that the opportunity cost (the relevant economic cost) of the resources tied
up in the movie was zero. Moreover, there is a real difference between any
loan the studio makes from a lender and this contract. Because a negative
net-profits pool does not permit the studio to recover from the participants,
the ‘‘loan’’ associated with the movie is actually nonrecourse and is thus
different in nature from any borrowings by the studio, which are backed, in
the end, by all of the studio’s assets.
In fact, these clauses all contribute to an ability to determine separate
contingent compensation pools for each picture, which allows the studio to
maintain confidentiality from one movie to the other.16 In effect, each movie
is a separate firm, with its own ‘‘profit’’ statement. I examine the potential
role of incentive contracts in this situation, after I turn to the evolution of
the ‘‘net-profits’’ contract.
B.

‘‘Net’’ and ‘‘Gross’’ Contracts

The contract in Buchwald is a ‘‘net’’ contract in that the contingent payment is a portion of the ‘‘net profits.’’ This is in contrast with the ‘‘gross’’
contracts that big stars are able to get, which pay a percentage of the gross
revenues, sometimes from the first dollar of studio receipts. However, as
the description makes clear, the net-profits participant does, in fact, get a
percentage of the gross revenues, but only after the gross exceeds the direct
and indirect costs of production and distribution and a distribution fee.
There are also contracts that pay a percentage of gross revenues once gross
revenues exceed a certain fixed-dollar amount or once the gross exceeds a
fixed multiple of production costs. Finally, there are some contracts that pay
a fixed percentage of the gross after the gross has exceeded an amount
equivalent to the point at which the net-profits pool turns positive. This is
equivalent to a net contract that, once the net-profits pool has turned positive, has a zero-distribution fee, expenses, and interest rate.
A useful way to look at the distinction between net and gross contracts
is to focus on uncertainty about the level of gross receipts required to trigger payment. One can contract for a contingent payment once gross reaches
16
I am not contending that this is the only contract form that allows for determination of
the profit or revenue share while maintaining the confidentiality of information about other
movies. Also, tying the rate to the readily observable prime rate is a way to avoid a costly
‘‘battle of the experts.’’

80

THE JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES

a certain fixed-dollar amount. In this case there is no uncertainty about how
well the movie must do to generate a contingent payment, but there is, of
course, still uncertainty about how well the movie actually will do. One
could also write a contract in which the payoff is contingent on gross receipts reaching some multiple of production cost. Depending on the relation
between box office and production costs, this may lead to different allocations of risk between the participant and the studio. Carrying this further,
we see that, in the net-profits contract, the point at which payment will be
triggered depends on the cost of production, the period of production
(which affects the ‘‘interest bill’’), and the promotion and advertising expenditures. All of these expenditures are, to a greater or lesser extent, under
the control of the studio. Thus, a potentially interesting question, and the
focus of Victor Goldberg,17 is the question why a contract that not only pays
off fairly infrequently but also allows one party to, in effect, alter the terms
of trade ex post continues to survive. I return to this question below.
C.

Participation Contracts during the Studio Era18

The modern net-profits contract exemplified by the Buchwald contract is
the result of years of evolution in contract terms. In order to trace this development I examined a number of contracts found in the Warner Brothers
Archives at the University of Southern California Library19 and at Warner
Brothers Studios. I have also found some examples of profit-sharing contracts at other studios. While I have no reason to believe that the Warner
Brothers contracts are unrepresentative of the kinds of contracts that were
written during the studio era, it does appear that the use of sharing contracts
varied from studio to studio. I have found no reference to sharing contracts
at MGM, the strongest and most prestigious of the studios. In contrast, the
financially weaker, and thus more cash-constrained, studios such as Warner
Brothers, RKO, and Universal did employ these contracts.
The contracts discussed below are not a small sample from a vast number
17

See Goldberg (cited in note 4).
This section summarizes a separate appendix on studio-era sharing contracts with excerpts of contract language and a discussion of the various contracts. That appendix is available from me on request.
19
These archives contain virtually of the internal documents for Warner Brothers from its
founding to 1965, except for employment contracts, which end in 1950. The contracts discussed below were found by tracking down references to sharing contracts in books and articles about Hollywood, references in internal Warner’s documents, or specifically looking at
Warner’s biggest stars (Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, James Cagney). In no sense, then, are the
contracts presented the result of a systematic search of the Warner Brothers Archives, which
is beyond the scope of this article. I do believe that I have seen the majority of the participation contracts that Warner’s wrote prior to 1948. The contracts discussed below, while not
representing all that I have seen, certainly represent the majority of them.
18

PROFIT-SHARING CONTRACTS IN HOLLYWOOD

81

of participation contracts. These contracts were not common in the studio
era, but they were present. Indeed, the increase in these contracts after the
studio era is one characteristic that I address in Section IV. For the purpose
of this discussion, the major distinction between net and gross contracts is
that net contracts subtract distribution fees and/or expenses before determining the contingent compensation.
1.

Examples of Contracts on Gross Receipts

There are a number of contracts that compute the contingent payment as
a percentage of gross receipts. In most cases, the contingent payment does
not begin until the movie’s gross revenues exceed some threshold, either a
fixed-dollar amount or a multiple of production cost.
As early as 1930 both John Barrymore and Al Jolson had contracts that
paid a percentage of the gross revenues from their movies. Jolson’s was for
a percentage of the excess over a fixed amount, while Barrymore’s was for
10 percent of the gross from the first dollar. In 1939 James Cagney signed
a contract covering 11 movies for $150,000 per movie plus 10 percent of
the gross receipts over $1.5 million.
In 1941 Hal Wallis, who had been a high executive at Warner’s, contracted to produce four movies a year for a salary plus 10 percent of the
gross once the gross reached 125 percent of the negative cost. While some
expenses were to be deducted, there was no distribution fee nor a charge
for prints and advertising. Overhead is specifically included in the negative cost, but it is to be an amount determined by Warner’s auditor, PriceWaterhouse. There is no mention of interest expense as a component of
negative cost.
Mae West had a contract at Universal in 1939 that provided for her to
receive a percentage of the gross once the gross reached a multiple of the
negative cost.
2. Examples of Contracts that Resemble Net Profits
The earliest contract that resembles the modern ‘‘net-profits’’ contracts
is one between Warner’s and David Belasco in 1923. This contract gave
Belasco a percentage of the ‘‘net profits.’’ It had the basic form of the current ‘‘net-profits’’ contract. The gross was defined in a manner similar to
current contracts, and Warner Brothers was able to subtract the costs of
making and distributing the movie, along with a distribution fee of 5 percent. There was no specific mention of overhead on production cost, but it
was specifically excluded from the distribution expenses. While Belasco
had audit rights to make sure that the contract, as written, was properly followed, he had no right to examine the relation between the distribution fee

82

THE JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES

and Warner’s actual cost of maintaining the distribution network. Thus he
could not determine Warner’s true profits on the movie.
In 1942 Errol Flynn’s contract specified that on every fourth picture at
Warner’s he would receive a percentage of the ‘‘net gross.’’ This term was
defined to be the gross revenues less all negative, advertising, and distribution costs and a 20 percent distribution fee. In June 1942 Bette Davis signed
a contract with a similar definition of the profit pool.20 In 1948 the director
Michael Curtiz signed a similar contract, though the distribution fee was
higher. In no instance was there any mention of the interest charge that is
in the Buchwald contract. In all cases overhead was determined, as in the
Cagney contract, by the studio’s auditors.
3. An Independent Production: Frank Capra—Meet John Doe
With the exception of the contract with Belasco, all of the Warner’s contracts that I have seen so far have been with Warner’s employees. While,
during the studio era, some studios financed and/or distributed movies
made by nonemployees, as a rule Warner’s did not. With the one exception
of Meet John Doe, Warner’s did not finance independent productions until
after the Paramount decision. In my discussion of the Buchwald contract I
compared the structure of the modern net-profits contract with the process
that an independent producer would have to go through to get a movie
made and distributed.21 Warner’s contract with Frank Capra Productions for
Meet John Doe in 1940 has the studio providing some financing, providing
the soundstage and technicians (at cost), and distributing the movie. This is
similar to the relation the studios established with producers after the demise of the studio system. Capra also obtained some financing outside of
the studio. Capra was responsible for 20 percent of the promotion and advertising expenses, and there was a 20 percent distribution fee. Capra would
not get any proceeds until (1) the bank received principal and interest and
(2) Warner’s recovered (a) a 20 percent distribution fee, (b) 80 percent of
the prints and advertising, and (c) any cash advances it made and the cost
of any services or labor provided by Warner’s during production. Thus the
contract had the features of a net-profits contract. It deals with overhead by
expressly setting the overhead rate at 0 percent, and there is no interest
charge payable to Warner’s for any investment it makes in the movie.
There is another way in which this contract is a forerunner of the Buchwald contract. In any contract in which production costs play a role, one
20
Although the Davis contract allowed for a distribution fee and expenses to be deducted
before her share was determined, it still referred to her having a share in the ‘‘gross receipts.’’
21
See Section IIIA above.

PROFIT-SHARING CONTRACTS IN HOLLYWOOD

83

problem faced is how these costs are determined. In modern contracts the
studio has a rate card for renting out soundstages, and this is the charge that
is made. At the time of the Capra contract, Warner’s did not normally rent
out its soundstages, so the contract provides that Capra is not obligated to
use Warner’s facilities or equipment if he can get them elsewhere for less
money.
At the end of the 1940s Warner’s financed productions by, among others,
United States Productions and Alfred Hitchcock. In these cases the contracts also provided for partial or complete financing and did not provide
for interest charges on any advances by Warner’s. Unlike the contract for
Meet John Doe, however, the contracts provided for the normal studio overhead as determined by the studio’s accountants.
4. Evidence from Other Studios
I have not found evidence of sharing contracts at the other major studios
(Columbia, MGM, and Paramount). I have no view on the likelihood of
such contracts at either Columbia or Paramount. However, I feel that it is
unlikely that there were any sharing contracts at MGM. For most of the
studio era, MGM was the most profitable and the highest regarded of all
the studios.22 For much of this period the biggest star at MGM was Clark
Gable, yet King notes that Gable never had a sharing contract until he left
MGM in 1954.23
5.

Summary of Studio Era Contracts

We have seen that even in the studio era some stars were able to negotiate contracts that explicitly gave them a percentage of either revenues or a
net-profits pool computed in a manner that is similar to that in the modern
contract. There are some differences. In contrast to the modern contract, the
point at which participation begins is usually defined as a multiple of the
production cost. As we have seen, the modern contract form determines
the break-even point, at which the participation begins, in terms of the recovery of a number of specific charges, with no multiplier. Also, in none
of these contracts is there any mention of the interest charges that I find in

84

THE JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES

modern contracts. Finally, in all save one of the contracts I have seen, overhead is not a fixed percentage of the negative cost.
D. Modern (Post-1950) Contracts24
The modern ‘‘net-profits’’ contract dates from 1950. Jimmy Stewart’s
agent, Lew Wasserman, negotiated a deal for the movie Winchester ’73
with Universal. At that time Universal was in financial difficulty and could
not afford Stewart’s normal salary of $250,000.25 Instead, Stewart got no
fixed salary but did get 50 percent of the ‘‘net profits.’’ Net profits were
contractually defined as gross receipts in excess of twice the negative cost.26
Mel Sattler, who negotiated the contract on behalf of Universal, put it this
way: ‘‘Universal accepted the proposal because it permitted the company
to put substantially less at risk by reducing its immediate production costs.
So-called ‘‘net-profit’’ deals were thus borne [sic] of a studio’s desire for
risk reduction.’’ 27
The break-even point of twice the negative costs was chosen because—
given the projected budget for the movie and what was known about the
costs of prints, advertising, and distribution—this would be the point at
which the studio would actually recover its costs. Thus in this case, as in
all the contracts that I cited from the studio era, the break-even point (at
which the ‘‘net’’ pool turned positive) was defined as a multiple of the negative costs. Moreover, the overhead portion of the negative cost in this contract was set at a percentage of the direct production costs. Thus Stewart

24
Much of this section is based on Mel Sattler, Declaration of Defendant Paramount Pictures Corporation Re: Phase II Hearing on Legal and Contract Issues, in Buchwald (cited
in note 1); and Mel Sattler, interview (May 1, 1995). I thank Mel Sattler for the time he
spent with me on this subject.
25
Winchester ‘73 is important for more than Stewart’s contract. It was the first of a series
of westerns directed by Anthony Mann, usually starring James Stewart, that reinvigorated the
western genre. It also initiated the most successful decade of Jimmy Stewart’s long career.
More detail on this collaboration can be found in Jim Kitses, Horizons West (1979); and Jon
Tusk, The American West in Film (1985).
26
Thus the contract is not really a ‘‘net-profits’’ contract after all but, rather, a type of
adjusted gross. This 50-50 split of gross over twice the production costs became a common
contract with independent producers in the 1950s.
27
Sattler, Declaration, at 5 (cited in note 24). Note that this reverses the usual risk-sharing
motivation. In this case, Sattler argues, the studio was less able to bear risk than the actor.
In the next section I present some evidence on why this might be the case. Sattler, in his
statement and in an interview with me (cited in note 24), emphasizes one unique aspect of
the Stewart contract. As opposed to other contracts during the studio era that I have cited,
and as opposed to the norm that followed on this contract, Stewart received no up-front compensation.

PROFIT-SHARING CONTRACTS IN HOLLYWOOD

85

did not have to rely on Universal, or on Universal’s accountant, to determine the appropriate overhead charge.28
This contractual form quickly spread, except that by the mid-1950s stars
were getting the percentage as compensation in addition to the fixed salary.
However, in general the definition of the break-even point continued to
evolve. Again, from Sattler:29
So called ‘‘Net-Profits’’ deals soon ceased being a way to share the risk of failure. . . . By the mid-1950’s, talent representatives were demanding that ‘‘Net
Profits’’ be paid in addition to, and not in lieu of, ‘‘up front’’ fixed compensation.
The studios acceded, but soon found themselves bound by deals that called for ‘‘up
front’’ cash payments and ‘‘back end’’ compensation that drained the revenues
from successful motion pictures that was necessary to finance the studios customary
development program and slate of motion pictures.
In the market-driven balancing of risks and rewards the studios began insisting
on and receiving terms that increased the amount of revenue necessary to reach
‘‘break-even’’ in the computation of ‘‘Net Profits.’’ For example, distribution fees
. . . increased. Interest charges were levied on the money both borrowed and advanced for production costs.

At the same time that movie stars were getting participations, there was
a change in the nature of film distribution agreements. As Tino Balio points
out in his history of United Artists,30 that firm initially had a policy of not
advancing money to producers. However, from the 1930s on, United Artists
found it necessary to advance funds to some producers in order to ensure
the necessary flow of films to the distribution network. These arrangements
were usually with producers who had a proven track record and would sign
multipicture deals. United Artists thus became the prototype of the modern
studio, providing financing services to a number of independent producers.
Samuel Zagon, looking back on the changes in distribution contracting
that occurred during the 1950s, notes that, at the start of the 1950s,31
[t]he distribution rates would probably have been 25% United States, Canada and
Great Britain, and varying from 30% or 40% in the balance of the world.
Perhaps more importantly, most of the distribution charges, such as for prints,
28
While I have not seen the contract, this point about the overhead was related to me by
Sattler (see the interview, cited in note 24). I am not sure whether the use of the percentage
for overhead was initially suggested by him or Wasserman.

THE JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES

advertising, screenings, dubbing charges, etc., would have been ‘‘off the top’’—
that is to say, reimbursed before computation of the distribution fee.32

However, the decline in the fortunes of the industry during the 1950s
brought changes, as Zagon notes that by the 1960s there was33
(a) a much bigger piece of the pie for the distributor at the expense of producer
through:
(i) increase in the distribution fees by approximately 25% of the amounts stated
above [the 25 percent and 35–40 percent in the previous quote]
(ii) (and again, perhaps more importantly than the stated increase in distribution
rates) the allocating of all of the charges of distribution . . . that is to say, the distribution fees were measured from the first dollar of gross income, and only out of
the remaining 70% to 50% of gross income were the charges for prints, advertising,
etc., deducted. . . .
(b) The second development . . . was the virtual elimination for a long time of
bank and institutional lending as a source of financing of motion pictures. Thus, to
get pictures, United Artists, and then, to a great extent, most of the other major
distributors, had to embark upon a program of lending, or obtaining the loans generally with its guarantees–to or for the producers of the pictures. . . .
As a concomitant of this latter development, the distributor uniformly in such cases,
has acquired percentages of the profits (this, of course, being in addition to the distribution fees) ranging up to 50%.

During the 1950s the major studios followed the lead of United Artists
and housed independent productions along with their studio productions.
Robins’s34 study of Warner Brothers output from 1946 to 1965 yields a
sample size of 207 independent productions financed by Warner Brothers
and 162 studio productions. As the studios supplanted banks in providing
financing for the productions, it was reasonable for them to charge for the
funds advanced. Thus, contracts with producers would have included a
charge for interest.
The developments referred to by Sattler and Zagon, which led to the
modern contract, took time, and other forms continued to survive. For example, in 1961 Warner’s agreed to finance and distribute The Chapman Report for Darryl F. Zanuck Productions, Inc.35 While the contract is not avail32
That is, the distribution fee would be applied, not to the entire income, but to a smaller
amount, thus reducing the fee.

35
Zanuck, one of the last of the remaining movie moguls, had been at Warner’s until the
early 1930s when he left to run 20th Century. He remained in control of 20th Century-Fox
until 1955. Because there is a reference in the internal Warner’s deal summary (P. D. Knecht,
preparer, Summary of Contract with Daryl F. Zanuck Productions, one page, no date, Warner
Bros. Archives at Univ Southern California Cinema Library) stating the fact that Warner’s
does ‘‘not finance items wasted by reason of move-over from 20th Century Fox,’’ I assume
that this is a pick-up deal.

PROFIT-SHARING CONTRACTS IN HOLLYWOOD

87

able, I do have an internal deal summary that sets out how gross was to be
split. Except for the items referred to,36 Warner’s provided 100 percent financing of a budget set at $1,800,000–$2,000,000. The gross revenues were
to be applied as follows:
1. WB—21/2 times direct production cost.
2. WB—4 percent interest on advances
3. WB—Foreign dubbing, superimposing costs and TV residuals
4. Balance—50-50 subject to penalty clause.
Note: Irving Wallace, author, receives 5% of gross in excess of $3,500,000
($16.4 million) which comes off the top.37

The contract does not provide for either a distribution fee or overhead in
determining how much Zanuck will receive. Presumably the extra 1.5 times
production cost is designed to cover this.
However, by the mid-1960s Bette Davis was to sign a contract that is,
essentially, a modern net-profits contract, which uses that phrase, and has a
financing charge.38 Similarly, an internal Warner’s memo in 1964 describes
the contract for Robin and the Seven Hoods as ‘‘a ‘double negative’ deal,
with 71/2% off the top to Dean Martin.’’ The fact that it can be referred to
this by a standard nomenclature is more evidence that these contracts were
commonplace.
Finally, in 1960 Edward Alperson contracted with the Mirsch Company
for a net-profits position in Irma La Duce: ‘‘Mirsch contracted to pay
Alperson . . . 25% of 100% of the net profits . . . defined net profits as gross
receipts . . . less the aggregate of distribution fees and expenses, interest on
production loans, and other expenses.’’ 39
Subsequently Mirsch contracted with Billy Wilder’s loan-out company
for a share of gross receipts over an ‘‘artificial break-even’’ of twice the
production cost.40 So we see that by the early 1960s the modern contracts,
in all their particulars, were in use.
IV. The Economics of Sharing Contracts in Hollywood
We have seen that sharing contracts existed in the movie industry at least
since the mid-1920s. While they evolved over time, the main forms of contract, the ‘‘net profits’’ and the ‘‘gross participation,’’ existed by the early

1930s. We also know that they were uncommon, being reserved for only
the most important talent in the industry. Any examination of these contracts must provide some insight into the increased use of these contracts
after the demise of the studio system.
In this section I examine alternative explanations for the use of sharing
contracts in Hollywood. The most common economic explanation for sharing contracts in general is they serve to provide the appropriate alignment
of incentives between the principal and agent, induce greater effort from
the agent, and thus lead to higher total cash flows. I suggest that this is not
the most likely explanation for the contracts in this industry. Before proceeding with the analysis, however, I examine some evidence on how the
motion picture industry changed after the studio era.
A. Changes in the Industry following the Demise of the Studio System
1. Fewer Pictures
One result of the demise of the studio system and the reduced demand
for motion pictures was a reduction in the number of motion pictures distributed by the major studios. Table 1 shows the number of movies distributed by each ‘‘major’’ studio on an annual basis for the period 1930–80.
The number of releases reached a maximum of 408 in 1937. It declined
slowly until the war limitations took effect in 1943, when the number of
releases fell to 289 from 358 in 1942. The number of releases recovered
from the mid-200s to reach the upper 200s, even passing 300 in 1951 and
1953 before beginning a fairly steady decline that bottomed out at 85 releases in 1977. Thus, the number of releases fell from the upper 300s in a
typical year, to about 100, a decline of roughly 70 percent. One would expect, then, that studio revenues fell. In fact, Robins41 reports that not only
did revenues drop, but so did box-office revenues as a percentage of consumer spending, dropping to .2 percent in 1965 from 1.2 percent in 1946.
This reduction in the number of movies distributed, and total revenues,
had a number of effects. There was an excess supply of physical motion
picture studios. The land became more valuable in other uses and often was
sold for development. The reduction also meant that it was no longer economical for the studios to employ large numbers of actors on salary as, in
effect, a stock company. During the 1950s and 1960s studios stopped placing new talent ‘‘under contract’’ and moved to a system where individual
actors, producers, and directors were only hired for one (or a small number)

of movies.42 The number of actors under contract to major studios, which
had been as high as 804 in 1944, fell to 164 in 1961 from 474 in 1949.
Similar declines are also found in the 1949–61 period for directors (to 24
in 1959, the last year available, from 99 in 1949), producers (to 50 from
149), and writers (to 47 from 91). With fewer movies being made it was
no longer possible to predict accurately the demand for a given number of
roles fit for actors/actresses with given characteristics. It can be argued
that this reduced demand for motion pictures, rather than the Paramount
decision, was the proximate cause of the decline of the studio system.
Without the ability to amortize costs over a large number of movies, the
‘‘production-line’’ approach that was one characteristic of the studio system
was no longer optimal.
Not only did the major studios produce and/or distribute fewer movies
after the demise of the studio system, but performers appeared in fewer
movies. Figure 2 presents the number of movies released in each year from
42
The vestiges of the contract system survived into the mid 1960s when Harrison Ford
was one of the last people hired on a contract basis by Columbia. The demise of the contract
system was, however, widely recognized as a likely outcome of the Paramount decision. In
the early 1950s Dore Schary, then head of production at MGM, asserted that, while other
studios might abandon the stock company, MGM would not. Of course, MGM eventually
did just that. At this time a number of stars also became ‘‘free agents.’’ The prime example
of this was Jimmy Stewart, who was not tied to any studio in 1950 when he signed with
Universal for Winchester ’73. Clark Gable, no longer ‘‘the King,’’ was released from his
contract by MGM in 1954.

1933 to 1992 by the top five finishers in the annual exhibitors poll of the
top box-office attractions.43
Thus we see that, not only were there fewer movies made after the studio
system ended, but also nonstars (fewer were under contract) as well as stars
made fewer movies.
2.

Increased Risk

Not only was there a decline in the number of movies produced during
this period, but there was also a change in risk in the motion picture business. One can argue from portfolio theory that with many fewer pictures
coming out of any studio the risk of the cash flows to a studio will go up.
There is less diversification.44 We have already seen this in Table 1. Moreover, the reduction in the number of releases understates the increased extent to which studio profit depends on a small number of films. Robins45
reports an increase in the concentration of revenues in a small number of
films. In the late 1940s the top 1 percent of films represented 2–3 percent
of studio revenues; by the early 1960s, this had tripled to an average of
about 6 percent. This trend has continued in recent years. In 1993 the
worldwide revenues for the top 1 percent (2 films) of the 163 major-studioreleased films were 13.8 percent of the total.46 Not only is there less diversification at the studio level (fewer movies released by studios), but there
is also, as we have seen, less diversification at the talent level. Further,
43
The poll is taken annually by Quigley Publications and is widely disseminated. Because
the ranking of top stars is the result of a poll, these stars are not necessarily the top-dollar
earners in a given year, though I suspect the correlation to be high. The films of the stars
were taken from a number of sources. Sometimes the high rank is a result of a film that was
released at the end of the previous year. In that case, a star may have no films released in
the year they were voted one of the top five attractions. As there is no clear bias for my
purposes, I ignored this issue.
44
There are factors that offset the effect of fewer movies on studio risk. For example,
during the studio era the censorship in place ensured that virtually all movies made would
today be rated no worse than ‘‘PG-13.’’ To the extent that studios are able to distribute movies aimed at different market segments, there may be more diversification today. Similarly,
since studios no longer have the stock companies of performers under contract, they are less
likely to be affected by the decreasing or increasing popularity of an individual performer.
Even if these effects moderate the effect of the reduction in movie production on studio risk,
evidence presented below suggests that risk has still gone up.

46
This is derived from data in the April 30, 1994, issue of Motion Picture Investor. It is
possible that the concentration ratio is affected by the fact that 1993 was the year in which
Jurassic Park was released. However, even if I reduce Jurassic Park’s worldwide revenues
of $953.2 million by 50 percent, the concentration ratio is 9 percent, which is still an increase. If I replace Jurassic Park’s revenues with those of Mrs. Doubtfire, the next-highest
revenue producer, the ratio is still over 8 percent. (At that time, Jurassic Park’s revenues
were the largest in motion picture history; as this article was being written, its sequel, The
Lost World, had just opened to record box office.)

the end of the studio era also saw increased turnover in top studio executives.47
We can also see the effect of increased risk at the level of the individual
studio. Figure 3 presents an analysis of the data from the Schaefer Ledger.48
For each movie in the ledger I computed a ‘‘profit ratio’’: the ratio of the
total gross to the production cost.49 For each calendar year I computed the
average and the coefficient of variation of that ratio for all Warner Brothers
movies released during that year. Figure 3 presents the average ratio by
year as well as the coefficient of variation. In order to highlight trends I
also present 5-year moving averages of these variables. From this figure we
can see the increased profitability of the studio during the years leading up
to and including World War II, with the profit ratio increasing by about 40
percent between 1938 and 1944 (to 2.62 from 1.98), before it declines to
less than 1.61 in 1947 and recovers to about 2.8 by 1960. More dramatic
changes occur in the coefficient of variation.50 The coefficient of variation
more than doubles during the post–World War II period, increasing to .74
in 1960 from .32 in 1946.51 As we shall see,52 this coincides with an increase
in the use of sharing contracts.53
47
Average tenure in office for executives in charge of production at the most stable studios
(Warner’s, Fox, Columbia, Fox, MGM, and Paramount) was around 20 years during the
1940s and had declined to 4 years by the 1970s and 1980s. Moreover, turnover was higher
at weaker studios. Thus risk also increased for studio executives as the studio system died.
To the extent that executive turnover is associated with financial difficulty, it may be no surprise that Universal was the studio that negotiated the Winchester ’73 contract because, as
one of the parties to the negotiations, they could not afford to pay James Stewart’s normal
salary. The studio (or its executives) could not bear the risk and laid it on the actor.
48
The Schaefer Ledger provides the data underlying H. Mark Glancy’s Warner Bros. Film
Grosses, 1921–1951: The William Schaefer Ledger (cited in note 16). It contains the gross
receipts and the production cost for every Warner Bros. movie from 1921 to 1960.
49
Of course, this does not capture the studio’s actual profit on each movie. Among other
problems with the data, it does not reflect distribution costs, nor does it capture any information regarding the timing of the cash flows.
50
Because the coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean,
and as the variable in question is the ratio of total gross to negative cost, simple scale changes
should not affect measure of risk that I report. The annual coefficients jump around quite a
bit. This year-to-year fluctuation appears to be due to outliers in the ratio. In most years the
ratio of the highest profit ratio for any movie that year to the second highest is less than 2.
The only exceptions are 1921 (the ratio of highest to second-highest profit ratio is 2.30), 1928
(3.57), 1930 (3.40), and 1959 (3.24). Figure 3 shows an increase in the coefficient of variation in the last 3 of these years.
51
In 1960 the ratio discussed in note 50 was 1.18, and in 1946 it was 1.01; thus in neither
year was the coefficient of variation driven by outliers.
52
See Section V below.
53
This may overstate the risk increase. I am really interested in the conditional standard
deviation. If the mix of movies made by Warner’s changed over time, we could see an increase in the cross-section coefficient of variation even if there were no increase in the uncertainty about the revenues of any individual movie.

Changed Organization of Production

54

Thomas Schatz notes that the studio era was characterized, at the most
successful studios, by one or more strong central producers, such as Irving
Thalberg at MGM. This central producer controlled the production of the
movie, playing a very active role in pre- and postproduction and truly shaping the movie. Directors, in this regime, simply shot enough good film for
the central producer to work with. By the mid-1940s some directors, notably Alfred Hitchcock,55 working within the studio but not bound to it, would
shoot much less film. This meant that Hitchcock, for example, was delivering a film that could not be significantly altered in the editing process,
thus protecting his vision of the film from interference by the producer, in
this case David Selznick.56
The demise of the studio system also had a more subtle effect on the
organization of film production. During the studio era, the strong central
producer system of moviemaking was modeled on a production line. In part
this was driven by a desire to get 40–60 films made in a given year for
exhibition in the studio’s, and others’, theaters.57 As the studio system died
out, we have seen that there was a dramatic decrease in the number of films
produced. David Bordwell, Janet Staiger, and Kristin Thompson58 note that
this removed a great deal of the pressure on film schedules. As studios
abandoned the production line as the model, more flexible forms of organization arose. Where once writers were kept away from the production side,
by the late 1940s they were able to at least observe what was going on.

studio era, focusing on MGM, Universal, and David Selznick).
55
Schatz (id) provides details on the relations between Hitchcock and David Selznick.
Hitchcock was under contract to Selznick, who would put together packages, including the
screenplay, director, and stars under contract to him (such as Ingrid Bergman). The movie
would then be shot and distributed by a studio, with Selznick as the producer.
56
Whether this lead to ‘‘better’’ films is an issue for film critics. The ‘‘New Wave’’ critics
(see Peter Graham, ed, The New Wave (1968)) argued that it did, but Schatz (cited in note
54) is not so sure.
57
It is tempting to conclude that studio had to put out enough films to fill the screens they
owned. This is not true. No one studio could produce enough films to meet the demand in
an era when double bills might change twice a week. Moreover, because each studio’s exhibition arms were strongest in different geographic locations, a studio would often prefer to
have another major’s theater chain do the exhibition. For example, Paramount had the best
theaters (the Balaban and Katz chain) in Chicago, and other studios would want their pictures
to play in Paramount’s theaters there.

This saw the rise of the multirole individual, exemplified by Billy Wilder,
who was a writer-director in studio context. This movement was facilitated
by a relaxation of the job definition by the labor guilds.

Increased Use of Sharing Contracts

We have already seen that there were some sharing contracts as early as
the silent era. The Schaefer Ledger indicates whether the movie had a direct
participant (such as John Barrymore) or showed advances to independent
producers, which implies a share. Figure 4 presents the percentage of Warner Brothers movies, by year of release, that had a sharing contract. It is
clear from these data that the frequency of sharing contracts increased dramatically after World War II. It should the noted that the ledger apparently
undercounts the number of movies with participants in the early years.59 I
do not believe that such understatement occurs in the later period, as the
studio established a separate department to ensure payment of participations. The fact that the studio established a formal department to handle
participations is an indication that they had become more common. In any
event, it is clear that by the late 1950s most movies had at least one sharing
contract.
Although this graph suggests a decline in the use of sharing contracts in

For example, the list omits the Jolson pictures and Tiger Rose, which I know from examination of the contracts had participations.

the late 1950s, this dip was apparently temporary.60 Today the vast majority
of movies, especially those financed by a studio, do have participants of
either the net or gross variety.
B.

Alternative Explanations of the Contract Form

In this section I present the various alternative explanations for the survival of this contract form and evaluate the evidence supporting each explanation.
1.

Studios Rip Off Actors and Everyone Else

While this not usually used as an explanation for sharing contracts in
general, it is the most popular explanation of the net-profits contract form.61
However, we have seen evidence that sharing contracts based on concepts
similar to the modern ‘‘net’’ and ‘‘gross’’ profits have been around since
the dawn of the studio era. Moreover, the motion picture community is
rather small, with a limited number of agents and attorneys involved in
drafting contracts. It is difficult to imagine that the studios have been able
to fool actors and producers for such a long period.62
However, there is another way in which the current contract gives the
studio a potential opportunity to enrich itself. It has been alleged the contract may provide an incentive for the studio to offer gross contracts to big
stars to the detriment of those with net contracts.63 The reason for this is
that in the usual contract the net participant has no control over the studio
or producer’s freedom to sign major stars whose gross participations are
treated as a negative cost and thus reduce the payoff to the net participant.
To the extent that there are payments for major stars signed subsequent to
the net participant, and there was some positive probability of a payoff to
net participants, the studio or producer does not bear the full cost of the
star’s payment.
Consider the following, simplified view of the issue. Let S be the amount
of ‘‘star power’’ used in the movie and P the other production costs, and
ignore the role of distribution expense. Let R(S, P) be the studio’s revenues
from the movie. I assume the revenue function has the normal properties,

Chisholm, Profit-Sharing versus Fixed-Payment Contracts (cited in note 4), provides
evidence that the trend continued to recent times.

where δ is the distribution fee and ω is the overhead percentage on direct

where ϕ is the portion of the net-profit pool going to the participant. First,
consider the case where there are no net-profit participants (ϕ ⫽ 0); the
profit-maximizing studio will invest in star power and production expense
to the point where the marginal effect of an incremental dollar spent in either factor of production is one. That is, S* and P*, the optimal values of

or production expense is lower than it is if there are net participants, and
the effect is more pronounced as the overhead percentage, distribution fee,

PROFIT-SHARING CONTRACTS IN HOLLYWOOD

97

or percentage of the pool paid to participants increases.64 Absent net participants, the studio bears all the expense of increased spending on any factor
of production; if there are net participants, the participants bear some of the
cost. Thus, the presence of net-profits participants means that the studio
does not internalize all of the cost and thus overinvests in certain aspects
of movie production. From this simple example we see that this effect has
nothing to do with gross participants. The same incentive exists if the star’s
salary is fixed and also applies to the production budget.
Interestingly, it turns out that there is a countervailing effect if the big
stars are paid a percentage of gross rather than a flat salary. If there are
no gross participants, the studio keeps all of the incremental revenues from
increased expenditures on, say, special effects (less any share paid to net
participants). However, if there are gross participants, the studio does not
get all of the incremental revenues but does bear all of the costs associated
with increased production expense (again, less any effect on payments to
net participants). Thus the studio will tend to cut back on these expenses,
which will tend to ameliorate the overinvestment problem noted above.
This analysis also helps to explain why the percentage of net-profits contracts that pay off is fairly small. To the extent that a risk-neutral studio
takes these effects into account, and there is no repetition of the game, it
will reduce the anticipated net profits to a level below that which would be
the case if there were no net-profits participants. However, if the studio
wants to contract with the same people again, it might well choose not to
go all the way to a zero-expected net-profits pool. Moreover, even if it did,
we would expect the studio to be wrong some of the time. Because the distribution of revenues is positively skewed, a given expected payoff will imply fewer (though larger) positive net-profits pools than would be the case
if the distribution were symmetric. These arguments all suggest that what
we should see is a situation where there are some positive net-profits pools,
though they are not the norm.
The fundamental problem is that someone has to be given the right to
choose the final cast and have decision-making authority during and after
production. The studio is the ultimate residual claimant on the film, and as
64
The incentive for the studio remains as long as there is any anticipated payment to netprofits participants. Of course this analysis is, in many ways, too simplistic and is designed
for only a limited purpose. I assume, for example, that the studio knows what the revenues
from the movie will be. I also omit the participation constraint that, after adjusting for risk
and monitoring costs, the compensation received by net participants must be the same as
what they would receive if they were paid a fixed salary. However, note that the studio gets
to choose the level of production expenses after the net participant has signed on (see Goldberg, cited in note 4). Also, I am dealing only with incremental changes in the movie budget.
A big star’s association with the movie might increase the likelihood that the movie will, in
fact, be made and thus actually make the net participant better off.

98

such it should not be surprising that the studio has the ultimate power to
sign the star. This is similar to equity holders being given the right to manage the firm. The potential conflict arises because the studio, through its
distribution function, collects a distribution fee that the net-profits participant never sees. To continue with the corporate finance analogy, this is akin
to having the controlling shareholder also own most of the firm’s outstanding debt. That shareholder may have an incentive to choose low-risk projects that benefit bondholders rather than stockholders. The distribution fee
is like a prior claim on the cash flows from the movie, like debt service.
In the corporate law area, the conduct of shareholders in such a position
is governed by the corporate law of the state of incorporation.65 The issue
here, however, is a matter of contract. A plaintiff could allege a violation
of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or covenant of best
efforts.66 At issue here is how the court will fill in the missing blanks in the
contract.67 What would be the reasonable expectation of the contracting parties regarding the studios freedom to sign a major star? The person who
signs a net-profits contract knows full well, at the time the contract is
signed, what the distribution fee is and who has, traditionally, had control
over casting the movie. Any ex ante benefit the studio might anticipate from
later signing a big star would be expected to be reflected in the fixed component of the contract.68 The only two alternatives to giving the studio
power over casting are (1) a complete ban on subsequent budget changes
or (2) required consent of the net participant.69 A complete ban on budget
changes is almost certainly not value-maximizing because budget increases
may actually serve to increase the size of the net-profits pool. While in principle the studio could give veto rights over subsequent third-party gross participations, or other changes, to every net participant, the contracting costs
65
In Buchwald (cited in note 1), the plaintiffs alleged that Paramount and the plaintiffs
were joint venturers in the film Coming to America, which gave rise to a fiduciary obligation
on Paramount. The judge rejected that claim.
66
The judge in Buchwald rejected these claims. A discussion of these concepts can be
found in virtually any contracts book. See Wood v Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, 222 New York
88 (NY 1917). Parev Products Co v I. Rokeach & Sons, 124 F2d 147 (2d Cir 1941), in which
the defendant introduced a new product that allegedly had the effect of reducing sales of a
product licensed by, and hence royalties payable to, the plaintiff, may be closer to this situation. Moreover, the treatment of third-party gross participations as a component of negative
cost was dealt with in Alperson (cited in note 39), where it was expressly permitted.

69
It might be argued that a third alternative would forbid subsequent third-party gross participations unless a fixed payment is made to the net participant. However, this does not alleviate the problem. Any fixed payment would still provide an opportunity for the studio to
exploit the net participant.

PROFIT-SHARING CONTRACTS IN HOLLYWOOD

99

would be large. It is certainly impractical to give every net participant, from
the author of the novel on which the movie is based, to the composer of
the score, and beyond, this kind of control. Moreover, it would be impossible for the studio to convey to each previously signed net participant the
information that it has regarding the benefits from hiring a new star without
revealing to the industry at large, and perhaps more importantly to the star
with whom it is negotiating, the benefit it expects to receive from the contract. Nor is it likely that the star would like to have the detailed terms of
her contract appear on the front page of Variety. Thus is it reasonable to
believe that both parties intended the studio to control casting.70
However, it is easy to overstate the importance of this possibility. Studios
are notoriously unable to predict the success of a movie. To the extent that
studio executives are reluctant to report losses, they will not offer big stars
compensation sufficient to capture all of their incremental contribution to
the movie. This reduces the likelihood that the big stars’ compensation will,
ex ante, reduce the net-profits pool. But, to the extent that this incentive to
hire big stars is a problem, it appears to be a problem inherent in the nature
of the business. The net participants want some promise of a back-end payment, which experience tells them will be small. The studio is not likely to
provide a participation in the true economic profits of the movie because
these cannot be determined without revealing everything about itself. The
net-profits contract is a compromise.
These arguments are related to Goldberg’s analysis.71 He focuses on the
question of why a net participant would sign a contract that provides opportunities for the studio to reduce her claim on the movie’s proceeds. He argues that, in fact, such an arrangement serves both the studio and the participant. Goldberg starts by suggesting that net participants are usually people
whose creative contribution comes early in the process of making the
movie. He argues that it is in the studio’s interest to keep these individuals
70
Moreover, even if it were found that the studio had violated its implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, establishing damages would be difficult. The plaintiff would have
to establish that the ex ante increase in box office from having a big star was not sufficient
to lead to a larger net-profits pool. An interesting variant might occur if the big star changed
the nature of the film. Consider the following hypothetical situation: suppose the author of
the play Driving Miss Daisy contracts with a studio to make a movie of the play. He might
have an interest beside monetary gain, such as protecting his artistic concept. By the time
the movie is made, however, Morgan Freeman has been replaced by Sylvester Stallone, Jessica Tandy has been replaced by Pam Grier, and a new subplot involves avoiding Chechen
terrorists by various bits of derring-do. Would the author have a cause of action? Parker v
Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation, 3 Cal3d 176 (1970), dealt in part with the question
of whether a musical was sufficiently like a western that Shirley MacLaine Parker should
have taken a proffered role in a western to mitigate damages arising from the studio’s decision not to make the musical that she had contracted to do.
71
See Goldberg (cited in note 4).

motivated. However, after their contribution has been made, it is not optimal to keep them motivated, and value maximization is served by the giving the studio the ability to, in effect, recontract with them by changing the
scale of production or including some gross participants. Of course, the studio cannot go too far in this direction and must maintain some reputation
for ‘‘fair dealing,’’ in the sense that it only adds gross participants to the
extent that it increases the total revenues enough to offset the effects described earlier. If the studios always engaged in actions that eliminated any
possibility of a positive net-profits pool, early signers would understand that
there will not be any net profits and the studios would lose their ability to
motivate. This is related to the point made above on studio incentives.72
It is unlikely, however, that this is the complete story. First, it turns out
that many people—for example, the composers who score the music for the
movie, screenwriters doing rewrites, and many performers—sign on for at
best a net-profits participation, after the star who will get a gross participation has already signed and the probability of reaching net has been diminished. Some of these people perform their function after the movie has finished production. This is inconsistent with the temporal ordering of net and
gross participants that Goldberg postulates. Moreover, it turns out that
many performers who get gross have a contract that may well be affected
by the presence of other gross-compensation contracts. Only a few performers get a percentage of the gross from the first dollar of revenues. Many
gross contracts call for payment of a percentage of gross after a break-even
point that is a function of the production budget, including the guarantee
portion of any gross contract, and any gross payments made prior to the
trigger point—the ‘‘cash break even.’’ Thus, it turns out that many whose
participation in the movie temporally follows that of most net participants
can be affected by other gross participations, though not to the extent that
net participants can be affected.
2. Incentives in a Principal-Agent Model
The Theory. While we may imagine that the contracts we see in the
movie industry are the solution to a more-or-less standard incentive contracting problem as described in Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmström,73 the
industry has some interesting features that make it difficult to fit it into this
framework. First is the fact that, while the basic technology of motion picture production did not change from the 1930s to the 1970s, the sharing

contract became much more common.74 If optimal contract form is related
to the technology of the industry, we would not have expected contract
form to change over time. Moreover, to the extent that these contracts involve a contingent payment to offset a desire for shirking on the part of the
agent, it is not clear what one means by shirking in the case of a motion
picture star. For example, consider the star who does not like the movie he
is working on. While, in principle, a performer could shirk, the effect of
this shirking would presumably simply be to make the star spend more time
redoing scenes until he gets it right. Thus, the quickest way out of a bad
situation may actually be to do it right the first time. Moreover, the motion
picture community is a rather small one, and it would be costly for a star
to get a reputation as being difficult to work with. Recall that in the absence
of the long-term contracts of the studio era, stars must recontract for each
new movie. In that case, the labor market for stars may serve to provide a
discipline through reputation effects.75
It is difficult to imagine that the ‘‘net-profits’’ pool provides much incentive to the performer. While it is certainly true that the studios pay out millions of dollars to individuals with net-profits contracts, it is also true that
only a fairly small fraction of movies, between 10 percent and 20 percent,
ever have a positive net-profits pool.76 Consider the argument that the effort
expended by a performer is not observable.77 There is little evidence that
this is the case. Directors are highly skilled, as are producers. Their success
depends, in large part, on an ability to make the kind of subtle judgments
about nuances of performance that make a movie a success and can turn a
performer into a star.78
74
Technological change in other industries could affect the motion picture industry by
changing, for example, demand for movies.
75
This point was made to me with some force by a number of people in the industry. The
same argument was made in the context of managerial effort in Eugene Fama, Agency Problems and the Theory of the Firm, 88 J Pol Econ 288 (1980), and was further analyzed by
Hart and Holmström (cited in note 73).
76
We can think of the net-profits share as an option that is far out of the money. Ronald
Gilson and Bernard Black, The Law and Finance of Corporate Acquisitions 356 (2d ed
1995), note that the vast majority of executive options have a striking price equal to the stock
price when the option was granted. Deep out-of-the-money options are rarely used in executive compensation packages, though this may be driven by tax considerations. It is also possible that, at least in that context, options with a low probability of actually paying off have
little incentive effect.
77
It is unlikely that the sharing rule is needed to induce effort in promoting the motion
picture. Promotional tours are observable and can easily be contracted for and monitored.
Thus the nonobservable effort is likely to be in the actual movie production.
78
However, shirking may still be possible if the star knows more than the director about
what he or she is capable of. Sidney Lumet, Making Movies 64 (1995), writes that Marlon
Brando will test a director early in a course of making a movie by presenting a deep and
shallow performance on two takes of a scene. If the director cannot distinguish between the

Another problem with viewing the participations as incentive devices is
that they often go to individuals who are not direct contributors to the motion picture. For example, both Alice Walker and William Groom recently
have raised concerns about their shares in the profits from the movies based
on their novels The Color Purple and Forrest Gump, respectively. However, in neither case was the screenplay used actually the product of the
novel’s author.79
In recent work Darlene Chisholm80 presents an analysis of profit-sharing
in the motion picture industry in the context of a standard principal-agent
framework. She concludes that the contracts are consistent with an incentive contracting model in the presence of hidden action or hidden information. Her basic argument is that the contract is a solution to a moral hazard
problem caused by the inability of the producer to actually observe the effort that the actor is expending in the motion picture. Her main empirical
findings are that sharing contracts are more likely81 for movies that (1) take
longer to make, (2) open at holiday time, or (3) were made later in her time
period. Actors are more likely to get a sharing contract in a movie if they
(1) are male, (2) have worked with the producer before, (3) have been in
more films, or (4) have had high revenues in their most recent film.
Chisholm’s results can support this article’s hypotheses as well as her
principal-agent theory. In effect she is asking the hypothetical question
‘‘What determines whether a given employee is paid a fixed salary or a
profit share?’’ Her analysis omits the key variable that, according to our
theory, determines whether someone is paid in cash or by a percentage of
the revenues or profits—the anticipated total compensation. The omitted
variable, anticipated compensation in a fixed-salary contract, is likely to be
correlated with all of the variables that Chisholm shows determine whether
the star gets a sharing contract. The reason is simple. As long as the star’s
compensation is increasing with her experience and track record (as it almost certainly is), budget-constrained (or risk-averse) studio executives will
find it most advantageous to give sharing contracts to the most expensive
(most experienced) performers. The more highly paid the performer, the
two, Brando effectively shirks for the rest of the movie. Of course, he is also pointing out
that a skilled director can tell what kind of performance Brando is capable of.
79
Both movies were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Screenplay Adapted
from Another Medium. In neither case was the novel’s author credited with the screenplay.

81
Her sample size is limited to, at most, 43 contracts. While her data set appears to be
the best one in use, some important information is not there. For example, she is unable to
distinguish between net-profits and gross proceeds participations. Moreover, she excludes
contracts where the star is also the producer—even though it is well known that in many cases
the producer credit given the star does not mean that the star served the traditional producer
function. If such stars are atypical, and they almost certainly are, this biases her results.

PROFIT-SHARING CONTRACTS IN HOLLYWOOD

103

greater the incentive to turn a large fixed cost into a variable cost. This will
induce a positive correlation between experience and the likelihood of a
sharing contract. When one looks at Chisholm’s results, each of the variables that she finds positively related to the likelihood of a sharing contract
is also likely to be positively related to either the star’s required compensation or the size of the movie’s budget. Thus, Chisholm’s main finding,
which she interprets as evidence in favor of an incentive explanation that
requires increased explicit incentives in the contract as performers age, is
clearly also consistent with a risk-sharing or budget constraints explanation.
Indeed, when she includes variables designed to measure the financial state
of the studio (a stronger studio should be less likely to grant a sharing contract) and the size of the production budget for the particular film (the more
expensive the film, the more likely is a sharing contract), she finds results
that are consistent in sign with the explanations I provide below.82
Frequent Contracting. In order to understand why it is unlikely that the
incentives provided by the ‘‘net-profits’’ pool are the main driving force in
the contract form, it is important to recognize the role that frequent recontracting can play in providing incentives by an agent to perform to the best
of his or her ability. As Eugene Fama83 pointed out in the context of the
market for managerial labor, the ex post settling up that occurs on a return
to the labor market may provide sufficient incentive for agents to avoid
shirking. With the demise of the long-term contracts that prevailed during
the studio era, stars (and others) are signed for limited deals, often a single
picture. In that case, an actor must perform at a sufficient level to convince
producers and directors to hire him. These are highly skilled professionals
who are aware of how the various elements (script, direction, production
values, performance) of a film work together and who can parse out the
contribution that the performer makes. Moreover, by judging the actor’s
work against those of other similar performers and against the actor’s previous work, they can judge the extent to which he has been ‘‘walking
through’’ a part. Finally, the motion picture community is a fairly small one
in which information travels quickly. Performers quickly develop a reputation, and this reputation is reflected in the wage they can earn.84

Frank Wells, and Jeffrey Katzenberg at Disney were casting Down and Out

in Beverly Hills, they took the opportunity to save on up-front expenses by
hiring stars whose star had, so to speak, fallen. Bette Midler, who had been
involved in series of unsuccessful movies, was signed for $600,000, exactly
what her salary had been for her first movie. Richard Dreyfus, who had won
an Oscar in 1979, was also signed for $600,000, half of his asking price of
$1,200,000 at the time.85 When there are short-term contracts and frequent
visits to the labor markets, coupled with evaluation by skilled professionals
and a small professional community so that the intangible aspects of working with a particular individual are revealed, there is no reason to view contingent portion of the compensation as being primarily an incentive device.86
One might argue that, even if the incentive portion of the compensation
is unimportant for actors and actresses, it is important for producers. Again,
the importance of reputation in the industry suggests that this alone should
be sufficient to induce producers to work hard.
3.

Apparently Risk-Averse Behavior

In some sense explanations that rely on risk aversion are the least appealing explanations of all. The studios are publicly held and thus would be
expected to be risk-neutral. Moreover, risk aversion, like taste, is the last
resort of economists because is explains too much. It is easy to use arguments based on one or the other party being risk-averse to explain almost
any observation that troubles an economist. Even if managers are riskaverse, we would expect the shareholders to contract with managers so that
this risk aversion will not manifest itself. However, such contracts may be
difficult to enforce, and thus managers have some freedom to spend shareholder money to avoid bearing risk.
We have already seen87 that one of the participants in the Winchester ’73
negotiations clearly states that a motivation for the contract was to get the
actor, James Stewart, to bear risk with which the studio was not comfortable. To economists brought up in the principal-agent view of employment
contracts in which the principal is risk-neutral and the agent is risk-averse,

‘‘Disney became known as the ‘Betty Ford Clinic’ of Hollywood’’).
86
Another way that frequent recontracting serves to foster information revelation is in the
effect that it has on the incentives for the evaluators to truthfully report on the individuals
in question. Because the evaluators will often have ongoing explicit and implicit business
relations with those soliciting the evaluation, there is less incentive to lie about what an individual is like.

PROFIT-SHARING CONTRACTS IN HOLLYWOOD

105

this may seem strange. However, that model is inadequate because it ignores the role of the producer or studio executive.
Neither the actor nor the producer is, in fact, negotiating with a risk-neutral body of shareholders. They negotiate with studio executives. We have
already seen evidence that the turnover of one of the most important executives, the head of production, has increased dramatically in the last 40 years.
Especially in the case of an established star, it is likely that the star is both
wealthier and more secure in his or her position than the studio executive
or producer with whom he or she is dealing. In that case, the star may, in
fact, be less risk-averse than the studio executive and thus may be willing
to bear risk that the studio executive may be interested in laying off. Chisholm88 discusses, and dismisses, this possibility. However, her dismissal is
not convincing.
Evidence from other industries provides support for the view that executives are reluctant to show losses. David Burgstahler and Ilia Dichev89 examine the cross-sectional distribution of earnings and earnings changes and
present compelling evidence that firms report fewer small losses and small
reductions in earnings than one would expect. This suggests that managers
use what discretionary powers they have to avoid small losses. Larger
losses are presumably beyond the range of management to avoid reporting
without violating Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In the motion
picture industry, substitution of profit or revenue sharing for fixed salary
arguably serves the same purpose.90
There is certainly anecdotal evidence that increased risk, coupled with
competition for limited studio funds, does play a role in the increased use
of risk-sharing contracts, which have the nice (from the studio’s point of
view) property that they only pay off when there is money to hand out from
the picture’s revenues. For example, the producers of Forrest Gump had
88
Chisholm, Profit-Sharing versus Fixed-Payment Contracts (cited in note 4), presents
some evidence consistent with this story. She argues that the evidence is very weak. However, given her small sample size (less than 40), the considerations about the relation between
sample size and power raised by Steven Brown (Model Selection in the Federal Courts: An
Application of the Posterior Odds Ratio Criterion, in Prem Goel and Arnold Zellner, eds,
Bayesian Inference and Decision Techniques 141 (1986)) suggest that the evidence is
stronger than it appears.

This is consistent with the results of Burgstahler and Dichev (cited in note 89).

great difficulty getting a studio to finance the movie until Tom Hanks and
Robert Zemeckis agreed to make the movie for a (first-dollar) share of the
gross with no up-front payment.91 This reduced the amount that the studio
would have to put up to make the movie. Moreover, we have already seen92
that risk in the motion picture business increased after World War II when
profit-sharing contracts become common.
More evidence consistent with the argument that risk has changed in the
motion picture industry is seen when we contrast the compensation of
movie stars with that of stars in episodic television. With the decline in motion picture production since the 1930s and 1940s and rise of television, in
a very real sense episodic television is today’s version of the run-of-themill ‘‘A’’ and ‘‘B’’ movies that the studios cranked out during the studio
era. That is, most of the major studio releases today would have been at the
high end of studio-era releases, and the weekly television series embodies
the more production-line approach that characterized most production during the studio era. When we look at compensation in episodic television, it
turns out that stars of weekly series usually work for a fixed compensation
per episode, with only the biggest stars getting percentage deals.93 Thus,
when we look at movies today, we are looking at what, in the studio era,
would have been the most expensive movies with the biggest stars. The increase in the percentage of movies with sharing contracts in part reflects
that change in the mix of movies released today as compared with the studio era. Not only are there fewer movies, implying less diversification, but,
on average, each is more expensive than a studio-era production.
It must be understood, however, that, while apparently risk-averse
behavior may explain part of the use of sharing contracts, it cannot be
the entire story. First, it says nothing about the contract terms that characterize the net-profits contract. Second, it can only be relevant for the few
big stars who account for a significant portion of the movie’s production
budget.

4. Other Possible Explanations
Information Asymmetry. Another possible explanation for the use of
risk-sharing contracts could be an information asymmetry between the star
and the studio or producer. At issue is the possibility that the studio (or its
executive) is better informed about the likely market for a movie. Consider
a case in which a star is negotiating with a producer for a given role. The
producer may know, or the star may think the producer knows, more about
the likely box office for the movie in question than the star. In that case,
the star knows that, even if he and the studio could agree on the marginal
contribution that the star adds to the movie, fixed-salary contracts put him
at a disadvantage. The reason is that the studio has every incentive to understate the anticipated revenues from the film.
A contract calling for a profit share has the effect of protecting the actor
or actress against an informationally advantaged studio or producer. The
risk that the actor must bear is, in effect, the compensation that the studio
or producer earns for being informationally advantaged.
In this situation, the optimal contract between the studio and the actor
may well involve both a fixed component and some sort of sharing rule,
even absent any desire to provide incentives to the actor. Consider two polar cases and the countervailing incentives for truth-telling on the part of
the studio. We have seen that, if only a fixed-compensation contract is
available, the studio has an incentive to understate the likely market for the
movie. In contrast, if the only contracts available included only a profit (or
revenue) share, but no fixed component, the studio would have an incentive
to overstate the potential market for the movie to get the talent to sign for
fewer points. Thus, the only contract that could possibly solve the information problem is a mixed contract with both fixed- and variable compensation provisions.
While this story has some appeal, it is easy to overstate the ability of
studio executives to predict the success or failure of a movie before it is
made. The anecdotal evidence here is quite strong: simply recall Ishtar.94 It
is hard even to predict success after the movie is completed. The head of
one theater chain, after attending a screening of Star Wars, told George Lucas that nobody would want to see the film.95 Moreover, it is not clear why
the studio has an information advantage relative to at least major stars. Presumably the studio, in order to induce a major star to participate in a movie,
94
Ishtar, starring the major stars Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman, written by Elaine
May, was viewed as a ‘‘can’t miss’’ comedy. It was a disaster at the box office and is the
classic example of how hard predicting success can be. See also DeVany and Walls (cited
in note 4).

108

THE JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES

will allow her and her agents to examine the same marketing data and have
the same knowledge of potential cast that the studio does; indeed, it is not
uncommon for major stars to get veto power over some other members of
the cast and the director.
The information asymmetry may go the other way. In the case of Forest
Gump, Paramount would not commit to the full budget requested. The budget reduction was achieved by having the star (Tom Hanks) and director
(Robert Zemeckis) agree to take no fixed compensation in return for a
larger percentage of the gross.96 In effect, Hanks and Zemeckis agreed to
provide some financing in return for a larger senior claim on the movie’s
cash flows. If we take this view, the question of why Paramount would
view Hanks and Zemeckis as the lowest-cost provider of capital is raised.
After all, presumably Paramount could have gone to the capital markets.
However, one effect of having the contracts structured this way is that, by
agreeing to the reduced up-front payment, Hanks and Zemeckis are providing Paramount with information about how they expect the shoot to proceed. From Paramount’s point of view it need not be the case that Hanks
and Zemeckis know more than Paramount but only that their view of the
likely success of the movie is based on different information than Paramount has. Structuring the compensation in this way reveals some of Hanks
and Zemeckis’s private information to Paramount and thus may serve to
reduce the risk to the studio. The studio, in effect, pays Hanks and Zemeckis for their information through the larger back-end.
Long-Term Relationships. If producers and studios are interested in
maintaining good relations with the limited pool of very talented top performers, there is another role for sharing contracts. They bond the executive. We see examples of a related phenomenon, that studios provide expensive, noncontracted for, bonuses when a film is successful. For example, it
was widely reported that after the initial success of The Firm, the studio
gave each of the major stars and the director a new car of a type featured
in the movie.97 Each car had a value of approximately $100,000. While this
was criticized in the press, it seems likely that the studio did have interest
in attracting major talent to work on future movies by showing a willingness to go beyond the letter of the contract. The studio has an incentive to
remain on good terms with talented people that may lead to payments above
and beyond the contract. In effect, the contract form that we see says to the
talent: ‘‘If this movie does better than we expect, we will share that upside

109

with you.’’ This leaves, so to speak, a ‘‘good taste in the mouth.’’ Such a
good taste may be especially useful in an industry where a star who had
signed a fixed-compensation contract for a movie that was ex post highly
successful might believe that she had been taken advantage of.
Economizing on Contracting Costs. When there is frequent recontracting, the parties have incentives to economize on contracting costs.
This will lead to standard-form contracts in the industry.98 In the motion
picture business, this leads to ‘‘boilerplate’’ definitions of the participations.99
Moreover, in a world of imperfect and potentially asymmetric information, the contract form can be used as a screening device. For example, consider an actress who attaches a high opportunity cost to her time, perhaps
because she is in great demand. A two-part compensation scheme, involving a fixed guarantee against a percentage of the gross or net revenue
stream, has a certain appeal. First, it allows her to screen potential roles to
ensure that the compensation meets her reservation utility; producers of
movies unlikely to make full use of her talents will not find it worthwhile
to meet the fixed component of her salary. The profit-sharing part of the
contract ensures that she will earn the value of her marginal product if the
movie turns out to be unusually successful. The same contract can be offered to all comers, and the actress need not fear that she will not capture
the ex post high marginal value of her role in a blockbuster.100 Thus, a contract that involves a fixed compensation and a percentage, or a fixed compensation against a percentage, means that she can spend less time evaluating the likely market for the movie before deciding which movie to do and
can offer the same contract to all producers, thereby reducing contracting
costs.

98
One former studio executive told me that in the 1950s, when these contracts first became
common, he found himself constantly making changes of a similar nature in each contract
as requested by the various agents. He contacted all of the major agents and worked out a
common form of contract, along with a personal pledge that, if he changed any of the terms
to be more favorable to the talent of one of the agents, he would change the terms of contract
for all of the major agents. Of course, the viability of this ‘‘most-favored agent’’ clause depended in part on the reputation of the executive.
99
Evidence in Buchwald indicated that Bernheim received the most favorable of a limited
set of contract definitions.
100
I have been told by people in the industry that this is essentially the case with the income that Jack Nicholson received for Batman. For that movie Nicholson received a
$5,000,000 guarantee against an increasing percentage of the gross that led to his earning a
reported $55 million dollars for playing ‘‘The Joker.’’ At about the same time Nicholson
signed an essentially similar contract for The Witches of Eastwick, which only netted him his
guarantee.

C. Summary of the Evidence
At this point it is useful to consider the possible explanations for profitsharing contracts in the movie business. The main possibility that has been
presented is that these contracts, like other sharing contracts, lead to equilibria in which agents expend more effort and increase output or profits. I
have, however, suggested that this paradigm is unlikely to provide an explanation for the sharing rule in the motion picture industry. If it is not explained by incentives, then what causes it?
Recall that, while we have seen that profit-sharing contracts existed during the studio era, it is clearly the case that they are more common today.
Also, we have seen that (1) the structure of the typical ‘‘net-profits’’ contract is that it pays less than 20 percent of the time, depending on the relative expense of the movie; (2) studios have been known to give uncontracted ‘‘bonuses’’ to talented individuals when a picture is unusually
successful; and (3) it is notoriously difficult to predict the profitability of a
given movie.
The annual schedule of a movie studio is likely to be riskier now than it
was during the studio era. This has translated into higher turnover of studio
executives. To the extent that there is, in evaluating managers, an asymmetry between losses and forgone profits that leads managers to view losses
as worse for their human capital than forgone profits,101 it is reasonable for
studio executives to reduce fixed expenditures in movie budgets. This is reportedly the reason that Tom Hanks’s and Robert Zemeckis’s contracts for
Forest Gump included no fixed compensation.102 Thus, in effect, some of
the risk associated with the movie is shifted from the studio executive to
the star103 —who may be wealthier and more able to bear risk.
Is there any evidence consistent with this story? Proven stars are likely
to have high compensation. One prediction of this view is that bigger stars
are more likely to have sharing contracts. When we examine Chisholm’s
study in this light, we see that the evidence is consistent with a simple alternative hypothesis to hers—bigger stars have more clout and require higher
compensation and take this compensation in the form of a profit or revenue
share. Why as contingent compensation? Increased risk and/or the normal
budget process of a large corporation conspire to lead executives to reduce
fixed costs. Bigger stars’ contracts, if guaranteed, are bigger costs and
hence are more likely to be the target of conversion to variable costs. Thus

102

PROFIT-SHARING CONTRACTS IN HOLLYWOOD

111

bigger stars are more likely to get sharing contracts. This is Chisholm’s
main result, and this result is consistent with the story I am telling in this
section.
There is another type of evidence that is consistent with the view that
sharing contracts in Hollywood are not primarily intended to align the incentives of performers with those of the studios. In none of my research in
this area, neither in the studio archives nor in the media, have I seen any
discussion of the possibility that a performer who is paid a percentage will
work harder. However, in the executive compensation area, where stock options and other incentive plans are also common, the internal documents of
the firm and its proxy statements, when discussing these plans, virtually always provide a link between the contingent compensation and aligning
managerial and shareholder interests.104 Thus, if the participant’s words in
these situations are to be taken at face value, risk rather than incentives is
the dominant force.
V. Summary and Conclusions
This article has examined two aspects of contracting in the motion picture industry. By examining the files of a major motion picture studio from
the dawn of the studio era, we have seen that the modern contracts that are
so much in the news had clear antecedents in contracts that date back to the
mid-1920s. Indeed, by 1930 at least one studio had written contracts that
provided for shares of the two main varieties used today, net and gross.
Thus the fact that these contracts were not in common use until the 1950s
and 1960s cannot be attributed to a change in contracting technology. Further, we have seen that some of the aspects of the contract that were ruled
unconscionable in Buchwald actually make the contracts more, rather than
less, amenable to audit by the contracting party. Thus, all else being equal,
these clauses are actually more advantageous to the talent than alternative
contract terms. We have also seen that the modern contract evolved to the
form we see today, influenced by the studio’s experience dealing with independent and quasi-independent (studio-sponsored) productions. It is also
clear that the frequency of profit-sharing contracts is much higher now than
it was at the height of the studio system. Thus any explanation of the economic role of these contracts must be consistent with their increased use
after the late 1940s.
When we turn to the motivation for such contracts, we are on shakier
ground (a Los Angeles metaphor). Recent developments in optimal con104

tracting theory invite economists to view profit-sharing contracts in the context of principal-agent theory, with a risk-averse agent bearing some risk in
order to provide the proper incentive if effort is unobservable or to sort out
high- from low-quality agents if skill is unobservable. In this framework
the principal is usually, though not necessarily, risk-neutral. I argue, however, that incentive issues are unlikely to be the primary explanation of
what is going on in the motion picture industry. First, when I apply the
model to actors, it is difficult to see what the unobservable characteristic is.
Performers are closely monitored on the set by highly skilled directors and
producers. Moreover, the prevalence of contracts that cover one or, at most,
only a few movies means that actors must return to the labor market with
great frequency. An actor who shirks, or presents other problems, will
quickly find his or her market value diminished.
Finally, it is difficult to see why the appropriate model is one with riskaverse agent and a risk-neutral principal. The actor is, in fact, not negotiating with a studio but, rather, with a studio executive who is in a highly
risky position and may have less personal wealth than the star. This leads
to the possibility that the contract forms that are observed result from a desire by studios to maintain good relations with stars and a desire by studio
executives to shift some risk to movie stars who may be less risk-averse
owing to wealth and life-cycle effects. The empirical evidence is consistent
with either or both of these explanations.
