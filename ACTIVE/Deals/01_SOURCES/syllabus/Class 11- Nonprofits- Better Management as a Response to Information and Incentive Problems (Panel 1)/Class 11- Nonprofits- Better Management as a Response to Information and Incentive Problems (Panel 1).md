**Problems Sheet #11 (Panel 1): Nonprofits:**

**Better Management as a Response to Information and Incentive
Problems**

1.  Review: To solve information and incentive problems---and,
    therefore, to be more effective in advancing their mission\--what
    are the two goals nonprofits need to pursue?

2.  Planning

    a.  What is a planning process? Do you think it can help with either
        goal? With both goals?

    b.  Why did JDC need a new planning process? What was the first step
        in launching it? Who was involved and why?

3.  Adele is a new CEO of Community Center (CC), which hosts various
    cultural and athletic activities for members and also runs CC
    Academy, a private elementary school. Some of the largest donors
    (including board members) began their relationship with CC because
    they sent their children to CC Academy. Since CC Academy was
    launched 15 years ago, CC has subsidized its budget. But now CC
    Academy gets many applications, brings in significant tuition
    revenue, and also attracts a lot of philanthropic support. Bart, who
    is CCs chief planning officer, has told Adele that he thinks the
    subsidy should be discontinued, especially because CC is struggling
    a bit financially. In particular, the cultural activities department
    ("CCD"), whose lecture series and concerts are core to CC's brand,
    are struggling financially.

    a.  Assume that Adele is persuaded by Bart's claim that the best
        thing for CC overall is to phase out the subsidy for CC Academy
        and redirect funds to CCD. Since Adele is the CEO, can't she
        just make this decision on her own? In answering the question,
        please highlight the importance of incentives and information.

    b.  Is this an issue that would appropriately be addressed in CC's
        annual planning process?

    c.  Carlo is Nonprofit's head of fundraising. He hears about Bart's
        idea to shift resources away from CC Academy, so he comes to see
        Adele. "You realize that most of our large donors now came to us
        through the school," he says, "and that includes three-quarters
        of the board." What concern is Carlo expressing? How can Adele
        use the planning process to address this concern?

    d.  To reallocate money from CC Academy to CCD, Adele wants to get
        buy-in from a number of people, including the head of CC
        Academy, the head of CCD, the head of fundraising, key donors,
        and the board. Who do you think she should start with and why?
        Is there a benefit of having separate meetings, instead of
        having everyone together at one meeting?

    e.  True or false: An effective planning process helps a nonprofit
        allocate resources where they are needed the most.

    f.  True or false: An effective planning process helps build support
        internally among a nonprofit's professionals, the board, and the
        nonprofit's donors.

4.  Erin, who is the head of CCD, comes to see Adele. "You know how we
    have been trying for months to get Saylor Twift (a famous performer)
    to give a concert at CC," Erin vents. "Well, it turns out that she
    came to sing to the kids at CC Academy." When Adele is surprised,
    Erin explains that Saylor's nephew is enrolled at CC Academy. Adele
    is frustrated that she, Erin, and the rest of the senior management
    did not know about this connection. "Once Saylor was coming," Erin
    vents, "we could have asked her to give a concert for CCD. I can't
    believe we missed this opportunity!"

    a.  Pam is the principal of CC Academy. Can you think of two
        reasons---one innocent, and one less so\--why Pam might not have
        mentioned Saylor's link to CC Academy or the concert to Erin and
        Adele? (Hint: one is an information problem, and the other is an
        incentive problem.) When confronted, which reason is Pam likely
        to give? Why?

    b.  What is a "silo" and why is it a problem?

    c.  Adele consults a Mark, a management consultant, about silos.
        "How do I get people in different departments to share
        information with each other and work together?" Mark mentions
        something they do at his firm: "We require people to have a 15
        minute conversation (assigned at random) every two weeks with
        someone who works in another part of the organization."

        i.  What do you think is the rationale for this idea?

        ii. What limitations (if any) do you see with this approach?

    d.  The reading mentions "peer review." What is it and why was it
        used in JDC's planning process?

5.  Recall that Bart is the head of CC's fundraising. Erin and Pam each
    have innovative plans for the coming year.

    a.  Why is it important for Bart's team to have current information
        about these plans, including the reason for launching these new
        initiatives, their goals, and the strategies for pursuing them?

    b.  Why might Bart's team not have access to this information?

    c.  Can Adele use a planning process to help them get this
        information?

6.  Assume that Adele expects CC's overall budget to increase by 3% next
    year.

    a.  Adele asks each of her direct reports to prepare a draft budget.
        She asks them to prepare three different scenarios. In one, they
        have a 1% increase over last year. In a second, their budget
        increases by 10%. In the third, their budget contracts by 5%.
        She asks them to attach a memo explaining the relevant changes
        in the second and third scenario. Why did they choose the
        increases and cuts that they are recommending? What information
        problem is this exercise seeking to address?

    b.  A theme of this course is that sometimes an effort to solve an
        information problem creates a new incentive problem, and vice
        versa. What incentive problem can undercut the exercise in "a"?
        Put another way, how might a self-interested member of Adele's
        team try to manipulate this process? What (if anything) can
        Adele do to address this issue?

    c.  Ned, who is the head of CC's board, calls Adele and says: "I am
        hearing some grumbling about the multiple budget scenarios. Some
        of your colleagues feel that their time is being wasted. I am
        not saying that I agree with this criticism, but I wanted you to
        know that it's out there." How do you answer him?

7.  *How to Save the World* suggests allocation resources based on three
    questions. What are these three questions supposed to help a
    nonprofit measure?

8.  The first question

    a.  What is the first of the "three questions"?

    b.  When Lee Goldman started as dean of Columbia Medical School in
        2005, how important was the challenge of responding to
        pandemics? When he concluded his service in June of 2020, how
        important was this challenge? What is the general lesson here?

    c.  Is it more important to shelter the homeless or clean a polluted
        river? Why is this a hard question? If it's not feasible to
        answer it, what suggestion does the reading make? What should
        nonprofits try to show instead?

    d.  Helen is the CEO of Help!, a humanitarian organization. She asks
        you to recommend whether to provide child care and medical care
        to children in Appalachia or in Westchester County (a suburb
        north of New York City)? What information do you need in order
        to answer the first question?

9.  The second question

    a.  What is the second question?

    b.  What is the difference between an "output" and an "outcome"?

    c.  To help children, Helen's team at Help! is deciding whether to
        invest in providing Covid vaccines. If they decide to provide
        vaccines, they will track the number of children vaccinated. Is
        this an output or an outcome? Assuming the vaccine works, how
        reliable a measure of social return do you think the number of
        vaccinations is? Why?

    d.  The reading uses the phrase "impact multiplier." What does it
        mean?

    e.  If Help! decides to vaccinate pediatricians instead, what
        "impact multiplier" would they seek to generate?

10. The third question

    a.  What is the third question?

    b.  The mission of HerJustice is to provide legal services to
        underprivileged women who otherwise don't have access to legal
        services. HerJustice does child support cases, but the
        organization does not represent clients in housing court who
        have been evicted. Why? Is the idea that deadbeat fathers are a
        more serious issue than eviction?

    c.  Legal Momentum also provides legal services to women. Two of
        their main initiatives are impact litigation and a helpline.
        Why?

    d.  In focusing on the well-being of children, Help!'s professionals
        are quite concerned about the rhetoric of City's mayor, where
        Help! runs a number of programs. He has been inflaming tensions
        and arguing (without evidence) that low-income families are the
        source of crime, when in fact they often are the victims. Ed,
        who is a board member of Help!, has urged Helen (the CEO) to
        make a public statement condemning the mayor. Why might Helen
        hesitate to make this statement? How (if it all) is this
        relevant to the third question?
