**Discussion Questions #9 (Panel 2):**

**Comparison With Venture Capital:**

**Asymmetric Information and Organization as a Substitute for Contract**

1.  Review: Information Problems in High-Tech Startups

    a.  Arlene is an engineer who has an idea about how to make
        artificial intelligence more effective. If she pitches her idea
        to average investors, how effectively can they evaluate it?

    b.  Would it be easy to draft a detailed contract specifying exactly
        what Arlene should do at each stage of her work in developing
        her new approach to AI?

    c.  True or false: Instead of this sort of detailed contract, the VC
        industry structures deals---and, indeed, companies\--in
        particular ways to address information problems and produce the
        right incentives. In other words, the industry uses
        organizations as a substitute for contracts.

2.  Structuring as a Substitute for Contract at Nonprofits: The
    Nondistribution Constraint

    a.  True or false: Nonprofits also use organizational
        structure---though, admittedly, a different structure---to solve
        information and incentive problems.

    b.  The defining feature of a nonprofit is the "nondistribution
        constraint." According is Henry Hansmann, who pioneered the
        study of the law and economics of nonprofits, a "nonprofit
        organization is, in essence, an organization that is barred from
        distributing its net earnings, if any, to individuals who
        exercise control over it, such as members, officers, directors,
        or trustees. By 'net earnings' I mean here pure profits-that is,
        earnings in excess of the amount needed to pay for services
        rendered to the organization."

    c.  Are nonprofits barred from earning a profit?

3.  Hansmann explained this nondistribution constraint--and, more
    generally, the justification for using nonprofits--as follows:
    "\[O\]ccasionally, due either to the circumstances under which the
    product is purchased and consumed or to the nature of the product
    itself, consumers may be incapable of accurately evaluating the
    goods promised or delivered. . . . In situations of this type,
    consumers might be considerably better off if they deal with
    nonprofit producers rather than with for-profit producers.

    a.  What kind of problem is Hansmann invoking to explain why
        nonprofits are used? How does his point connect to the main
        themes of this course?

    b.  Why might nonprofits be another tool in the toolkit for dealing
        with this sort of issue? Why is the nondistribution constraint a
        potential solution?

4.  First Type of Information Problem: Expertise

    a.  Ben has serious back pain. He has no medical training.

        i.  How effective is he personally in analyzing the diagnosis he
            receives from a surgeon that he needs surgery?

        ii. Does this help explain why the oldest and most prestigious
            hospitals in the U.S. tend to be nonprofits?

    b.  Chris's car won't start. He has no training as a mechanic.

        i.  How effective is he personally in analyzing the need for the
            repair recommended by a mechanic?

        ii. In the U.S., are auto repair shops usually nonprofits or
            for-profit firms?

    c.  Debbie needs a lawyer to sell her home. She has no legal
        training.

        i.  How effective is she personally in analyzing the need for
            the contractual terms recommended by her lawyer?

        ii. Do most lawyers in the U.S. work for nonprofits or for
            for-profit law firms?

5.  Second Type of Information Problem: Personal Contact

    a.  Elizabeth, who lives in NY, wants to buy flowers for her mother,
        Francis, who lives in Chicago and is celebrating a special
        birthday.

        i.  Is Elizabeth likely to buy flowers from a nonprofit or a
            for-profit firm? Why?

    b.  Gail, who lives in NY, wants to contribute to provide emergency
        relief for an earthquake in Asia.

        i.  Is she likely to contribute to a nonprofit or a for-profit
            firm? Why?

        ii. How (if at all) is the information problem Gail faces
            different from the one Ben, Chris, and Debbie faced in
            question \# 4?

        iii. Could advances in technology change her assessment of this
             issue?

6.  Third Type of Information Problem: Impact

    a.  Ilene loves to run, stroll, and ride her bike in Riverside Park.
        She appreciates that everyone who wants to enjoy the park is
        allowed to do so free of charge. She knows that the park needs
        to be maintained, and that New York City only covers a portion
        of this cost, so she decides to make a donation.

        i.  Given how much time she spends in the park, does Ilene still
            face the same sort of challenge as Gail in question \# 5?

        ii. In deciding whether to donate, does she face a different
            information problem? Can the use of a nonprofit help to
            address the problem in "ii"?

7.  Review: This course has emphasized two different types of problems
    that can undermine an otherwise beneficial transaction. One is about
    information. What is the other type of problem? (Hint: It also
    starts with an "i.")

8.  Externalities, Incentives, and Public Goods

    a.  Helen and Ilene are neighbors. Ilene likes to use an old
        wood-burning stove to heat her home. Jane sells her the wood.
        Unfortunately, the smoke tends to blow from her chimney into
        Helen's open window, making Helen's home unpleasantly smokey.

        i.  When Ilene buys wood from Jane, do the two of them consider
            the impact of their transaction on Helen?

        ii. What is an externality? Is the externality in this example
            positive or negative?

        iii. True or false: Externalities create flawed incentives
             because the parties to a transaction don't have optimal
             incentives to avoid the relevant costs (in the case of
             negative externalities) or to create the relevant benefits
             (in the case of positive externalities).

    b.  Helen and Ilene live on a private road, which is not maintained
        by their town. In the summer, there are a lot of mosquitos. A
        portion of the land along the road is owned by the town, but the
        town does not spray it with pesticides to reduce the mosquito
        population. Instead, the town has given permission to Helen and
        Ilene to spray it.

        i.  If Helen sprays the parcel owned by the town, will Ilene
            also benefit?

        ii. If Ilene sprays the parcel, will Helen also benefit?

        iii. What effect do your answers to part "a" and "b" have on
             Helen and Ilene's incentive to spray?

        iv. What does the term "free riding" mean?

        v.  [Economists define a "public good" as a commodity or service
            that costs the same--regardless of how many people use
            it--and is available even to those who don't pay for it. Is
            a mosquito-free neighborhood a public good?]{.mark}

9.  A distinguishing feature of venture capital is that the sector's
    products---high-tech startups---have significant social value.

    a.  Is the same true of the nonprofit sector?

    b.  Do nonprofits generate externalities?

    c.  Do tech-startups also generate externalities? To the same extent
        as nonprofits?

    d.  True or false: An important function of nonprofits, and of
        government subsidies to nonprofits, is to address negative
        externalities---and, thus, to deal with incentive problems.

10. Nonprofits as a Response to Public Goods and Other Incentive
    Problems

    a.  Mary is worried about climate change. She founds a research
        organization to study what causes climate change, how to slow or
        reverse it, and how to mitigate its effects.

    b.  Is the knowledge that Mary's organization develops a public
        good? Does it have positive externalities?

    c.  Would you Mary's organization to be a nonprofit or a for-profit
        firm?

    d.  Mary decides to work for the organization, and she obviously is
        passionate about its mission. How do expect her feeling about
        her work will compare with her friend Nick, who does data entry
        for a widget manufacturer?

    e.  Based on your answer to "d," what comparative advantage to
        nonprofits sometimes have over for-profit firms?

11. Tax Subsidy

    a.  Mary's organization runs a surplus. Does it pay tax on this
        surplus? What if the widget manufacturer where Nick works runs a
        surplus?

    b.  Mary's friend, Olivia, donates to \$10,000 to Mary's
        organization. What tax benefit can she claim?

    c.  Assume that Olivia's tax rate usually is 50% (a 40% federal rate
        and a 10% state and local tax rate). What is the real financial
        cost to Olivia in making this gift?

12. Governments versus Nonprofits

    a.  In principle, either the government or nonprofits can provide
        public goods and respond to market failures. For example, social
        security is a program that ensures that elderly people have
        enough resources, so they don't become dependent on the
        community for food, medicine, and other basic necessities.

        i.  Do you think the government or nonprofits have a comparative
            advantage in running a program like this?

        ii. What does the term "economies of scale" mean? Are there
            economies of scale in a program like this?

    b.  One way to prevent drug addicts from contracting HIV is to
        provide them with clean needles. Was this program first
        administered by the government or by nonprofits? Why?

    c.  Where did the civil rights movement begin--in the government or
        in nonprofits? What about the movements for women's rights and
        gay rights? What about the environmental movement? Why?

    d.  Rachel buys a birthday present for her brother Peter. Assume he
        loves the gift.

        i.  True or false: The gift makes Peter happier.

        ii. True or false: The gift makes Rachel happier.

        iii. In economics, there is a concept called "the double utility
             of giving." Is is illustrated by Rachel's gift to Peter.
             What does this phrase mean?

        iv. When Rachel pays taxes, do you think she experiences the
            double utility of giving?

        v.  What about when Rachel gives money to her favorite charity,
            which is a soup kitchen? Does her donation produce "double
            utility"?
