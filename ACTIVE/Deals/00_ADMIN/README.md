## QC Process

**QC happens by editing documents in place** (no separate QC docs).

**Tracking:**
- Add QC columns to MASTER_LOG: `Prep_QC`, `Review_QC`, `Outline_QC`
- Each QC pass increments counter: `0` → `1` → `2` → `✓`
- QC findings go in Notes column or in doc frontmatter

**Workflow:**
- Generate draft → QC pass 1 → Edit → QC pass 2 (if needed) → Mark `✓`
