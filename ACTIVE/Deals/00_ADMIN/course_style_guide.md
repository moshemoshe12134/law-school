4. **Explain why it matters**

**For Analytical/Calculation Questions:**

1. **Show your work** (calculations, reasoning steps)
2. **Use bullet points** for clarity
3. **Highlight the answer** at the end (bolded)
4. **Explain the implications**

---

### Formatting Rules

**Headers:**

- Use `#` for main title
- Use `##` for question numbers
- Use `###` for sub-questions (A, B, C)

**Emphasis:**

- **Bold** key terms, definitions, YES/NO answers, final answers
- Use *italics* for subtle emphasis only
- **DO NOT use ALL CAPS** (except for acronyms)

**Bullet points:**

- Use for lists of 3+ items
- Keep concise (1-2 lines each)
- Use parallel structure

**Tables:**
Use for:

- Comparing options
- Tool/problem pairs
- Side-by-side analysis

---

## Course-Specific Conventions

### Economic Reasoning Patterns

**Incentives matter:**

- People respond to how they're rewarded/punished
- Structure deal terms to align incentives

**Risk allocation:**

- Assign risk to whoever can best bear it
- Consider: Risk tolerance, control, information, insurance, diversification

**Information is costly:**

- Due diligence and verification have costs
- Design mechanisms to address information asymmetry

**Contracts as mechanisms:**

- Deal structures solve information and incentive problems
- Trade-offs exist (every solution creates new problems)

---

### Three Core Problems Framework

**Use this framework to analyze every deal:**

1. **Information Asymmetry**

   - One party knows more than the other
   - Solutions: Due diligence, contingent price, representations & warranties, third-party vouching
   - Risk: Solution provides insurance → moral hazard
2. **Agency Costs**

   - Decision-maker's interests conflict with principal
   - Identify: Principal and agent
   - Where interests diverge
   - How agent can benefit at principal's expense
   - Solutions: Equity comp, oversight, incentive alignment
3. **Uncertainty**

   - No one knows what will happen
   - Solutions: Contingent payments, insurance, risk allocation
   - Who best bears risk (6 factors)

---

### "Who Best Bears Risk" Analysis

When allocating risk, consider:

1. **Risk tolerance** - Who can best absorb losses?
2. **Control** - Who can influence the outcome?
3. **Information** - Who knows the risk best?
4. **Insurance** - Who can most cheaply insure against the risk?
5. **Diversification** - Who can spread this risk across many events?
6. **Predictive ability** - Who can use historical data/law of large numbers?

---

## Content Requirements

### Must Include for Each Question:

1. **Direct Answer** - Clear response to what's being asked
2. **Reasoning** - Economic or legal logic behind the answer
3. **Examples** - Concrete illustrations of the concept
4. **Connections** - Links to other questions/concepts when relevant
5. **Nuance** - Acknowledgment of complexity or trade-offs

### Special Sections:

**For "Define the Term" Questions:**

- Formal definition
- Real-world example
- Why the concept matters
- How it applies to the scenario

**For Scenario-Based Questions:**

- Facts of the scenario
- Key issue or problem
- Analysis from multiple perspectives
- Practical implications

**For Calculation Questions:**

- Step-by-step math
- Final answer (bolded)
- What the answer means
- Why it matters

---

## Exam Answer Style

### Structure for Transaction Design Problems

**1. Identify the Problem**

- What core problem(s) does this deal face?
- Information asymmetry, agency costs, uncertainty?

**2. Analyze the Parties**

- Who are the parties?
- What are their interests?
- Where do interests diverge?

**3. Design the Solution**

- What legal mechanisms address the problem?
- How do they work?
- What trade-offs exist?

**4. Justify Your Design**

- Economic reasoning (efficiency, incentives)
- Practical considerations
- Policy justification (if asked)

---

### Writing Style

**DO:**

- Use economic reasoning
- Consider all three core problems
- Design practical solutions
- Justify your choices
- Acknowledge trade-offs

**DON'T:**

- Propose solutions without economic justification
- Ignore trade-offs
- Use solutions that create moral hazard without addressing it
- Over-complicate when simple solution works

---

## Common Patterns to Address

### "Due Diligence vs. Insurance" Insight

Distinguish between:

- **Addressing information asymmetry** (allowing buyer to inspect/verify)
- **Providing insurance** (protecting against buyer's own actions)

**Key framing:** Solutions that go beyond the information asymmetry problem (by effectively providing insurance) create moral hazard problems.

### "Who Best Bears Risk" Analysis

Use the 6-factor framework:

1. Risk tolerance
2. Control
3. Information
4. Insurance
5. Diversification
6. Predictive ability

### "Agency Cost" Framework

When discussing conflicts of interest:

1. Identify the principal and agent
2. Explain where interests diverge
3. Show how the agent can benefit at the principal's expense
4. Propose mechanisms to align incentives

---

## 📝 REVIEW DOCUMENT FORMAT (DEALS-SPECIFIC)

### Why Deals Reviews Are Different

**Standard review format (other courses):** Extract exam-ready material from transcript - focus on what professor emphasized.

**Deals review format:** Compare prep to transcript and note differences.

**Rationale:** Deals prep documents are already rigorous, exam-focused Q&A formats that track literal class steps. The prep already contains the analysis framework and exam-ready material. The review validates and adjusts based on what actually happened in class.

---

### Deals Review Purpose

**Primary function:** Fidelity check between prep and class discussion

**Key questions:**

1. What was covered in class vs. what was in prep?
2. Did professor follow the prep's analytical structure?
3. What additional emphasis/examples/framing did professor add?
4. What was NOT covered (deferred to next class)?

## PREP vs. TRANSCRIPT COMPARISON

### Coverage Overview

**✅ Covered in Class (matches prep):**
- [Question 1: Topic - all parts]
- [Question 2: Topic - parts A, B only]

**⏸️ Partially Covered:**
- [Question X: Topic - parts covered vs. not covered]

**❌ Not Covered in Class:**
- [Question Y: Topic - deferred to next class]
- [Question Z: Not reached]

---

## ADDITIONAL CONTENT IN CLASS (Not in Prep)

### [Section Title]
[Material professor added that wasn't in prep questions]
- May include: Review of prior class, extended examples, tangential discussions

---

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Review of Previous Class Content

**Deals Class Pattern:** The first 10-20 minutes of class typically involve reviewing the previous class and covering any remaining content from prior classes that wasn't fully addressed.

**How to Handle in Review:**

1. **Document the Review Section:**
   - Time spent: [~X minutes]
   - Content reviewed: [Class N-1 topics]
   - Any new material added: [Additional examples, emphasis, or clarifications]

2. **Check for Carryover Content:**
   - Was there unfinished material from previous classes?
   - Did professor complete any deferred questions from prior preps?
   - Note if this affects coverage of current class material

3. **Integration Impact:**
   - How does the review affect understanding of current material?
   - Any connections or themes carried forward?
   - Does it change emphasis on current class topics?

**Example from Class 3:**
```
### Opening Review of Previous Class

**Professor opened with ~15 minute review of Class 2 (tax planning):**

1. **Four main points from last time:**
   - Regulatory arbitrage: "economically similar things being treated differently"
   - Four types of tax planning: exclusion, conversion, deferral, shifting
   - Non-tax frictions (costs that offset tax benefits)
   - All-parties analysis (tax impact on both sides)

2. **Detailed review of Fran/George hypothetical:**
   - Cash method taxpayer timing preferences
   - Same tax bracket = no net benefit
   - Tax accommodation parties (nonprofits, non-US persons, insurance companies)

**⚠️ DIFFERENCE FROM PREP:** This review section occupied significant class time (~15 minutes) but was not in the prep sheet.
