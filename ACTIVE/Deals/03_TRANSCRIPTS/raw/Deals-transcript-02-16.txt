Mr. I played the ropes. Still OK, everybody, Thank you all. So let's start with uh, just a couple of logistics, points about, um, about logistics. So first of all, we missed the snow day. So we have our makeup this coming Friday, and it's gonna be the usual time, 1:20 to 2:40, room 101, which is next door. Um, I realized it's not a regularly scheduled time, which means some of you won't be able to be there. There's no penalty for not being there. Please watch the recording. For those of you who can be there, great. If not, please just watch the recording. So, we have a makeup on uh this coming Friday, uh, 1:20 to 2:40. I'm gonna send an email about what I'm about to say. Also, I think the registrar's office either has or is supposed to, but I haven't seen anything. Then we're also gonna have one other makeup. And that's gonna be, and I'll put this in an email, it's gonna be March 27th, Friday, March 27th, and that'll be at 11:40 in the morning until 1 o'clock, 11:40 until 1. It'll be in the other building in the basement, the big room in the basement, L 107. Same thing, if you can be there, great. If you can't, watch the recording. It's not a regularly scheduled time. I realize some people won't be able to be there. Um, and then this is already on courseworks, but there are two classes we're not gonna have at the regularly scheduled time. One is on April 8th, and the other is on April 22nd, so no class on those days, which means we are missing three classes. We're making up two classes, and then my plan is to do a review session, which will be Sort of the, the 3rd. So, uh, those are the logistical points I wanted to share and I do intend to send an email about those two makeups later. Questions? OK, so we've been talking about M&A. We talked about the fact that there are 3 different types of provisions in an acquisition agreement. Uh, one of them is a representation. This is what is true. It's usually what's true as of the signing date, and there's the signing date, and then a few weeks will pass, and then the deal will actually close if it's a complicated transaction. So what's true as of the signing date, there's usually a mechanism at closing for people to reaffirm the representations. This is still true. It's not always the case, but it's pretty typical. But at least initially the reps tell you what was true as of the signing date, and it really is a way to narrow due diligence because there are hundreds of things that sellers are expected simply to check off and say yes this is true. And when you find the few that they say I can't give you that rep, that's where the due diligence will focus is why can't you and what's true and what are you worried about? OK, so then there are covenants because you have this period of time between when the agreement is signed and when it closes that could be several weeks and so there's a mechanism that's needed to kind of divide responsibilities. That people do what the other side expects and all the rest and so covenants are a commitment. It's sort of forward looking as of the moment when you sign starting now and until we close, these are the things that we will do. These are the things that you are supposed to do. Then the third type is a condition which means if this isn't true on the closing date we're not the the deal is off. So those are a much narrower set of circumstances. One of them. As a material adverse change or MAC clause and basically what it says is if the world changes in certain ways then uh the deal doesn't happen and everybody is freed up from their responsibilities. This is kind of a strange clause if you think about it because usually the idea is well OK I mean you signed knowing the world might change and whatever changes after changes. After and those are the breaks because you made a commitment. Each side made a commitment to the other, but this is a situation where that commitment can be nullified. So we need to understand why. What we'll see in a few minutes is that there are two different types of explanations from Matt Clause. They're both about incentive problems, but they're about different incentive problems. So we're going to talk about that. But before we do. Um, just to review. We were also talking about the fact that there are other clauses uh that can almost function like a MAC clause but they aren't the MAC clause and so a lot of the discussion today is gonna focus on the pandemic which was uh an unusual situation and therefore prompted some interesting contractual terms and disagreements and all kinds of problems and so we're gonna look at different aspects of that, um, but one of them. That we looked at is just the idea that maybe contracts at the end of the day are limited in what they can do for you and this was the landlord tenant situation. You can have a landlord, you can have a clear contractual right to something and if you insist on getting paid, your tenant might just declare bankruptcy and say sorry, can't do it like if you own a strip mall and there are stores that are legally closed, the store might just say sorry, can't pay you bankrupt. Then the point is you could get them out assuming the court system is running, which wasn't necessarily true for much of the pandemic, uh, and then the question is, but why would you want to because what are your chances of getting another tenant to come in. And if the situation is your contract isn't really doing you any good, then you can think more in terms of reputation and repeat interactions and hey I tell you what, I know you can't pay me now, so don't pay me for the next 10 months, but in Y months please pay me 50%. And starting in Z months we'll want the whole thing, but we're your partners here as well as your landlord. We want you to succeed. We want you to stay and so then you kind of try to get the goodwill and you avoid the cost of trying to find someone else. So, um, to me as a lawyer, as I said when I encountered this strategy on the part of a company where I served on the board, I was mystified at first like why don't you just make them pay you. And the point was, um, how, how exactly and you know what do we have to gain by getting rid of these tenants? They were good tenants before we think they'll be good tenants again and really this is a time where we're just setting the law aside and, and working off a different playbook so this can happen. The other thing we were talking about is the limited transaction they were selling Victoria's Secret to a private equity fund. And they were smart enough uh to know that the pandemic was a possibility even though it was going at a fairly unpublicized and low level very early days uh the lawyers said material adverse change can cancel a deal but we are saying that this pandemic is not a material adverse change it cannot be used to trigger um the the map clause so you can't get out of the deal based on that but what they hadn't thought through and what. Their client hadn't thought through is there were other clauses that could be invoked and so that ordinary course of business clause loomed large here because legally you had to close the stores. The rational, although regrettable reaction was to lay off a lot of people and not to buy a lot of new inventory that you wouldn't be able to sell. And so this is what the Limited did thinking that they were doing the responsible thing on behalf of the buyer who was going to buy them, but because they didn't consult, they breached the ordinary course covenant to the point where when the other side raised it, they didn't even litigate about it. They basically said, oh gosh, I guess we. That up and I think it's particularly poignant in a way and you could tell I have a distorted view of what might be poignant not sure other people would use the term, but I, I tend to think that if they had asked, which was their obligation, right, don't act without the consent of the buyer, only an absolutely crazy buyer would have said no because if they are stuck with buying this business, then of course they don't wanna go further into financial difficulty by. In continuing a payroll with uh you know work expected of people and um loading up on inventory they can't sell would be a bad idea so this was clearly the right thing to do for the business it just became an opportunity for the buyer to get out of this so um. We should start with um the, the question about Carl and C Brands and D's Secret and all that, it's part C of that and bringing a lawsuit. So I want to pick it up there, but first, any questions or comments? OK Alexander. Uh, can I think panel one right now, I think. Good, so, uh, can you help with this? So in bringing a lawsuit, what other motive might Evergreen, the buyer, have aside from trying to terminate the deal? So 11 idea is they can get out of this, but there's another thing they may be trying to do instead. Um, I think they might not actually want to like terminate, terminate the deal, but they might just want to kind of like threaten termination and get like a lower purchase price, renegotiate the purchase price, exactly, and although that's not what happened with Victoria Limited. Uh, Victoria's Secret being sold by the Limited, um, but it is actually what happened with Tiffany's where LMVH, you know, Louis Vuitton or LV, I, I got the, the, you know what I mean, I got the name wrong, but, um, that company was supposed to buy Tiffany's. They had a different out which I'm gonna ask you guys about in a moment. Um, but they used the out not to cancel the deal. They did still buy Tiffany's but at a significant discount off of the price that they had originally, uh, committed to. So sometimes this is a renegotiation device rather than, um, just actually trying to end the transaction. So with that, Alexander, um. So we're gonna assume that the MAC clause doesn't apply and it did not apply to either of those deals because the lawyers had inserted in the MAC clause, you know, the idea that COVID-19 was not a material adverse change that could trigger, uh, end of the deal. Um, there are other covenants and we looked at the ordinary course covenant, but another possibility, and this is actually the one that Louis Vuitton used, is a debt covenant. Do you know what a debt covenant is? Um, a debt covenant is a promise in a loan statement that the borrower, borrower will do certain things while the loan is outstanding. Very good. Uh, these are commitments that, um, borrowers make in taking on a loan, and Alexander, let's just think about why that might be relevant. So you're thinking of lending me money and so are there things that you'd like to know before you decide to lend to me? What kinds of facts are important? Um, like how well the business is doing, right, because, uh, if the business is doing well then you can have some confidence that in lending to me you'll be paid back but you wanna evaluate my credit and so you'll have to evaluate my credit as of the day when you decide to make a loan to me. Um, and so am I right that once you make that judgment and I have a good credit today that I'm always gonna have a good credit because nothing can ever change about your credit. If I had a good credit on January 1st, then of course I'll have a good credit next February. Uh, I don't think that's true. Don't think that's true. OK, you're, you're a tough bargain here. All right, so is it true perhaps that my business might be doing well now but not so well later? Yeah, there's a there's like a risk that in the future the business like will take a downturn. It could things could change a lot in which case would you maybe feel less good about having a loan to me if my business is doing badly? Yes, yes, so but your problem is you can only assess the credit once before agreeing to make the loan, but let's say it's a 10 year loan. Is there something else you could do if my business starts to do badly? I mean, you've already given me the money, but what can you do uh in response? Because you said I could keep the money for 10 years, but. Could you maybe say, in general, you get to keep it for 10 years, but if your business is doing badly, you have to pay me back right away? That might make sense, right? So the point is you can, uh, structure the deal so that the loan comes due early if things are going badly in the business. Well, but how do you feel about writing into the loan if the business is doing badly then? Do you like that as a standard, a trigger for the loan coming due early? I think that's a little too vague. I think you needed to have more like specific and well defined triggers that will trigger the repayment. We need some objective facts, right? And so can you give an example of something like that? Um, like if the business sees, uh, like 50% or more like decrease in profits like in a certain year, so we can have triggers based on revenue, we can have triggers based on profit, we can also have triggers, uh, you know, let's say for example. That I've borrowed $10 from you and then I go to Ellery a few weeks later and I say, hey, can I borrow from you and don't worry about Alexander I'll give you priority we'll make yours a secured loan. Does my credit still seem the same if there's another lender in there who's coming ahead of you? No, no, so maybe that should be a trigger also, but in any event, one of the standard triggers, and these are the so-called debt covenants, here's the loan, but during the term of the loan you, the borrower, have to comply with the following conditions. One of them would be your revenue needs to be at least. 4 times the annual interest that you owe us, right? And I just made up the 4. It could be any number, but the point is this is a way to be comfortable that if the revenue is always that multiple whatever it is of the interest that you'll be able to pay the interest. So let's say that Tiffany's had loans is borrowed money, and it had made commitments that um. That it's revenue had to be more than 5 times the interest that it paid and let's say that that was fine because you know the revenue is actually 7 times like they had a a nice cushion there. Is it possible that the pandemic would change that? Um, Like the fact that they have 7X, I, yeah, I think so because during the pandemic probably like people are spending less and so, um, the like the revenues of Tiffany's is probably gonna be lower, right, so. Um, legally the stores were closed in a lot of places. Um, who by the way tends to be the most enthusiastic customer for that pretty blue box? tourists, right? Because you're dramatically overpaying, which is something you're probably only willing to do on vacation. And so if you're not on vacation walking into the store and you're looking at this jewelry online and you realize that there's other jewelry online that looks very similar for, you know, half the cost. You might not jump to buy the Tiffany's product quite as quickly and in fact their revenue is dramatically down, which meant they tripped their debt covenants and it is not unusual for an acquisition deal, among other things to say between signing and closing you have to comply with your debt covenants. And this is a way that the buyer piggybacks on the safeguards that the lenders have already put in place because if something's happening that should worry the lender, it should worry the buyer too. And so this is why Tiffany's had to renegotiate their price because the original deal that they struck required them to satisfy debt covenants that they could not satisfy. So even though the MAC clause didn't get them out of this because of COVID-19. COVID-19 ended up causing them to trip on debt covenants to violate commitments they made to their lenders which were also woven into the uh acquisition agreement and became obligations to the buyer as well. People see that? Yeah, please go ahead.

SPEAKER 1
For the transaction with LVMH, would the debt covenant lower the price of Tiffany's? Like, in other words, LVMH would then have to take on that same covenant, right? It would be transferred to them, so it would be an obligation that they would be taking on in addition to everything else.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, and so that's a nice way of explaining. Why a buyer would care about uh violations of a debt covenant uh now if you're buying assets instead of stock maybe not because you're just buying the assets, but especially if you're buying stock then you're stuck with uh the need to get new loans or to renegotiate a new interest rate which people wouldn't. Nessarily want to do so um anyway so those are ways that you can simulate a material adverse change clause without actually using it but now let's turn to the actual MAC clauses to see how they work and why they're there because the truth is, as I suggested, there is a bit of a puzzle, um, other questions? Yes, go ahead.

SPEAKER 2
Um, so this is just a clarification question. Um, so the debt covenant is one that exists between Tiffany and a third company. And then, so when that thing is triggered, that's the thing that's that the deal between Tiffany and LVMH was based on, right?

SPEAKER 0
Right. In other words, there was a separate covenant in the acquisition deal between. Louis Vuitton and Tiffany's where Tiffany's said in between signing and closing we will honor all of our debt covenants and when they couldn't honor their debt covenants they were violating the acquisition agreement which gave Louis Vuitton the opportunity not to close and they actually did close but at a significantly lower price. OK, um, Cayetana. Can you help us please with the next question? So now we're turning to mat clauses, and there are two different possible reasons why these clauses are so common, and we'll start with one called the symmetry rationale. And so when a. Seller and a buyer sign a contract they presumably expect to close the deal in a few weeks or months, but sometimes things change. So can you read part A for us? Why am I?

SPEAKER 3
Why might a seller regret selling and want to cancel the deal? Uh, a seller might regret, uh, selling if new information arrives after signing, uh, and that makes the company more valuable than originally thought, right, if the company has a

SPEAKER 0
lot of good news, as you say, new information the market didn't know, it wasn't priced into the deal, hey, we launched this product, it is so much more successful than we thought we settled. This lawsuit for so much less money than we thought, you know, you could pick your reason there could be any number of reasons. The economy is so much better than it was a few months ago and our sales are really up and so boy we sold for too cheap. We never should have agreed to x as the price. We should have gotten at least 1.1x. This is such a shame we regret it. Well, OK, I mean. Regret is part of transactions. Sometimes you overpay. Sometimes as a buyer you overpay. Sometimes as a seller you get less than you want, uh, so, so it goes, and yet part B.

SPEAKER 3
Assume the seller is a public company and the relevant jurisdiction requires shareholders to vote to approve a deal before the deal can close. If the seller's business is doing well in the weeks before the shareholders vote, how confident can the buyer be that the deal will close? What if the seller's business is doing badly? Um, if the seller's business is doing well, the buyers, uh, should be less confident and shareholders may vote against the deal. And if the seller's business is doing badly, the buyer should be more confident and shareholders are more likely to approve the deal.

SPEAKER 0
Very good. So, um, those of you who know the phrase another bite at the apple, the shareholder vote gives the seller. Another bite at the apple in terms of the price because let's say they agree to a price of X and then there's lots and lots of good news about the selling company and it really seems like X is not a high enough price and it should have been 1.1x. Well, the seller management. Has committed to uh I mean the board really the seller's board has committed and they have to recommend the deal but they know that shareholders, you know, they don't control shareholders they work for shareholders and if the price looks low given all the good news lately. The selling shareholders might vote no to the deal, which means either it doesn't happen or the price gets renegotiated up. But notice that this is only a one-way street because sometimes what happens is you negotiated for the price of X and there's terrible news. Oh my gosh, the economy has really cratered in the last few weeks. Our sales are way down. The product launched it so much less well than we expected. There's a new lawsuit. It's gonna be expensive, you know, pick, pick your reason. All of a sudden X seems like. A really, really high price for the business and it probably ought to be more like 0.8X. So if you're a shareholder you wanna be fair and so you might say, well, you know we did, we are entitled to X but it just wouldn't be right to insist on this. Let's give the buyers a break. No, they will not do that, right? They will vote to approve the deal with much celebration. So this is a one way ratchet against the buyer and in favor of the seller, right? If the market moves one way. The shareholders won't approve it if it moves the other way, they will. So, um, hope everybody can see that. OK, so which brings us then to the next question. The buyers stockholders do not have to vote to approve a deal. Does this put buyers at a disadvantage if conditions change after a deal is signed?

SPEAKER 3
Yes, potentially.

SPEAKER 0
It does it does because the seller has this additional bite at the apple if things are going our way we're gonna renegotiate the price if things are going against us we're gonna hold on to that price and nobody can stop us. This is a very seller friendly system and it's true and I think pretty much every state uh in the US so it's a kind of a standard hardwired feature of um US acquisitions, um, so Lily. Can you help us with the next, which is Part D? Assume that corporate law gives sellers an advantage over buyers and affording sellers, but not buyers, ways to back out of a deal if market conditions change. Assume that that's true and we've seen it is true. Is there a reason why sellers might want to give up this advantage and level the playing field? Yes, sellers may want to give it up because it places them. At a disadvantage because there's more opportunities for the buyers to get a better deal. So let's think this through. So, uh, your first reaction, uh, and I don't mean you, I mean our, everybody's first reaction ought to be, hey, if the corporate law is giving sellers an advantage. They ought to love that, right? They ought to hold on to that they ought to take advantage of that they ought to love it, right? But actually it can create a problem for sellers and this is a bit counterintuitive, but I think maybe some of you see it already and and hopefully all of you will will see it in a minute if you don't quite yet so back to you. True or false, the ability to renegotiate a deal, if the market goes your way is really useful once you have a deal. True, true, right? Once you have a deal this is fantastic and so then I come back to you it's our constitutional right. To get a deal right, like we're entitled for some buyer to pay us what we want that's, that's our right as Americans. No, there's a world in which there's no deal at all. Yeah, you, you're not entitled to a deal. You have to get the deal first. Now from the perspective of someone who's just decided to sell and they don't have a buyer yet. Is this right that they have to renegotiate? Is it potentially gonna make it a little bit harder to find a buyer? Yeah, because I guess some buyers could sort of wait and see who else bids first before making a deal or they could make them uncertain whether they want to enter into it all because they know the sellers can just renegotiate. Right? There's a funny way in which from the buyer's perspective, um. You almost don't wanna buy because if it turned out to be a good deal because your price is a bit low based on the world it's getting renegotiated but if the price is not low if it turns out to be high you're stuck with it so that's not a very appealing situation from buyers' perspectives and so back to you. You are thinking of buying 01, or 2 companies. In the case of one company, the price they're asking for, we'll call it A. Price A is really cheap from your perspective. You would pay 30% more than A if you had to. You are thrilled that they're willing to sell it for A, so that's our first deal. The second possible deal, the price is X. You would pay X. That's about the top of what you'd be willing to pay anything more and you think it probably is a mistake, uh, and so in a world where you knew the price was going to be fixed and done, you would do both deals, but in this world where it might be renegotiated but only in a bad direction for you. Is it possible you would still do A because you that first deal because the price seems cheap to you? I guess it depends on your risk preference, but if you're willing to pay like 30% over the asking price, you'd be willing to up to a certain point, right? So I think that first deal still happens. The buyer is thinking, I so want this deal. This is so clearly something I wanna do. The price is so right based on my evaluation that I'm going ahead even though I know it might get renegotiated. Would you do the same calculation with X, the second deal where you're kind of agreeing to pay the top of what you'd be willing to pay? Probably not it wouldn't be worth it for you to enter into that deal, right? Probably not. Now we've been looking at this from the perspective of the buyer, but we started a minute ago from the perspective of the seller. No, we don't care about the buyer right now. We're sort of saying, would the seller ever view this renegotiation right as a disadvantage and so is it better. To have more people willing to bid for your business? Probably it's better to have a more competitive bidding process. So what your sellers really like is an auction, right? If you're just negotiating with one potential buyer, there's not a lot you can do to get that price up, whereas if there are 5 potential buyers and they're bidding against each other, the price will go up. So if you don't yet have a deal, and that's the key, if you don't yet have a deal. Then it is in your interest to have a situation where more people wanna bid and just to review, does this rule, does the ability of shareholders to vote and therefore to veto deals, does that increase or reduce the number of potential buyers for a given business? I think it's a deterrent. It's gonna reduce the the people for whom the price is sort of at the margin it's close to what they're willing to pay and you know there there really isn't room for give. They won't bid if they don't bid there's no auction. So what have we said? What we've said is when the corporate law gives sellers an edge, an asymmetric benefit in these negotiations, which it does, that's a very nice thing to have assuming you were gonna get a deal anyway. But we shouldn't assume that because actually this rule operates not just after you get the deal but it affects whether you get a deal and if so what the price will be and the fact that buyers are at this disadvantage might deter some buyers from bidding and it might actually lead you to get a lower price so you might not actually like this it seems like an advantage but it may not be. Do people see that? OK, very good, very good. All right, um, Catherine. So let's turn then to part E. How could sellers make the playing field more level? What kind of clause could they use? Note that some commentators call this a symmetry explanation for the relevant contractual term.

SPEAKER 4
I think one solution to this problem would be the MAC clauses that we discussed earlier in the case of some sort of like extenuating circumstance that gives both the seller and the buyer these avenues to be able to back out of a deal.

SPEAKER 0
Good. So basically one explanation for a mat clause is it kind of seems like a buyer friendly clause you said you were gonna buy. But you don't have to under these specified circumstances you don't have to. Well, one reason why that might be included in deals is because the sellers already have something analogous, not exactly the same, but analogous with the seller. It's a public deal, um, you know, public. Target, um, the shareholders can veto the deal if something changes, so maybe we ought to give the buyer an ability to get out of the deal if something changes. It's not quite the same, but it's somewhat similar and therefore there's balance there and the idea here would be the Mac clause gets buyers comfortable to bid who otherwise wouldn't have been comfortable to bid because they know that otherwise the sellers have this advantage they don't have. So this is one explanation, the symmetry explanation for the mat clause. Everybody see that? Questions? All right. Uh, so, Catherine, once again, we see the need for contractual or other responses to incentive and information problems. Um, what is the term moral hazard mean and how does it apply to this issue?

SPEAKER 4
Sure, so moral hazards relate to when certain parties are more insured against risk than others, they're more likely to make risky and potentially like financially not the best, um, decisions and in this case, I think the sellers, um, having disability to have shareholder approval, it's like not exactly the same. Um, as like the MAC clauses because, um, they still have kind of like an upper hand in the negotiating process because they're able to renegotiate the price if something goes better for the company.

SPEAKER 0
Thank you. So there are a couple of different incentive issues going on here and what we've seen is the first incentive problem that a MAC clause may be there to solve is the buyer doesn't have an incentive to bid because they're entering into a marketplace where they're at a disadvantage. And so you have to try to rectify the disadvantage to increase their willingness to improve their incentive to participate and of course their hesitation is the result of a different incentive problem which is selling shareholders are going to veto a deal if the market moves one way and embrace and celebrate a deal if it goes the other way. So we have these two different interacting incentive problems which can discourage otherwise useful deals and so you need to fix it. But then there's a separate kind of incentive problem, and this is a transition into the second explanation for MAC clauses, which is if somebody else bears the risk or or pays the cost for your risky activity you'll be. More risky in what you do if someone else bears the cost of the mistakes that you make, maybe you'll be less careful and so that's our transition to the so-called investment rationale for that clauses. So let's turn to explanation number 2. Um, so, Ping Heng, can you help us please with part four? Fran is the CEO of Cellar, which owns residential real estate. She signs a deal on July 1st to sell the company to buyer, which also owns real estate. The deal is scheduled to close on December 31st. Um, can you read part A for us?

SPEAKER 5
OK. Friend knows that she's unlikely to stay on after the merger costs. What issue does that create for buyer? And I think there will be an incentive problem for buyers because uh friend knows that she will be fired soon and has no incentive to run a business well, but the buyer wants to buy the business in its current state.

SPEAKER 0
Right, so when the buyer is making a decision, they think this is the business that I like, this is the price that I'm willing to pay for it, but that valuation assumes that it's going to be well maintained between the signing and the closing. But what we've just seen and Ping Hong, you're absolutely right, maybe Fran doesn't have that strong an incentive to take good care of the business, right? She knows she's not staying on if the business does badly, it's gonna hurt the buyer it doesn't really hurt the seller, her boss. What does she care, right? And, uh, life is short and she might as well enjoy herself in the next few weeks, collect the paycheck, start looking for another job, plan. Vacation before the new job, you know, whatever it is, but the one thing we worry about is she's not going to be focusing on running the business as well as it can be run, and that's what the buyer wants. So now we have a different incentive problem. It's the incentive problem of seller management how much attention will they pay to their responsibilities so now. Uh, Part B, how important is it to continue to maintain the properties and to renew the relevant leases? How motivated the seller's management gonna be?

SPEAKER 5
Um, I think it is important to buyer because the properties and this is what they are going to buy. So, um, seller has no incentive to do that because they will not benefit from it.

SPEAKER 0
Good, so it is it is important and we have a real concern, um, and so the next question, what kind of incentive problem are we describing? How could a MAC clause play a role in addressing it? And note that some commentators call this an investment explanation for a MAC clause.

SPEAKER 5
Um, I think, uh, we are talking about moral hazard and agency costs. Um, my classes can solve this problem because if seller don't do it, uh, normal job in his regular course of business and it's basically, uh, starts to go badly, buyer can terminate the deal.

SPEAKER 0
Very good. So this is an agency cost and a moral hazard problem. It's, it's both an agency cost in the sense that who is the person who is really affected if the business does badly? Well, it's the buyer at this point. There's a price that's been set, assuming it will inevitably go forward. It's the buyer whose interests are being attended to when the business is run well. And Fran is still in control and she doesn't she's she's acting as the buyer's agent, um but not necessarily a loyal agent and there's also an element of moral hazard because if she makes mistakes the buyer will pay, she won't pay uh if she takes too much risk that risk will cause. Suffering to the poor buyer doesn't affect her and so when other people are bearing the costs of your activity, particularly your risks, risky activity or your negligence, that's a form of moral hazard. So we have both here two, different ways to explain the same incentive problem and so then the point is, OK, so anticipating that sellers might say. I love this. I'm sorry, buyers might say this is a great business. It's exactly what I'm looking for. If I knew for a fact that it would be this way in 6 months when we close, I would totally pay $10 for it. But I don't know what's gonna happen in the next few months. I sign on the dotted line and you guys may just get very lazy and it may look pretty different by the time I own it, so I'm not gonna buy or if I do buy, I want this 10% discount because I just don't trust that it's gonna look this good then, right? And so a deal may fall apart because of that concern and by the way it, it might fall apart even though Fran is the kind of person who is gonna work. At 100% level of effort all the way until she turns the keys over to the buyer, but you just don't know, right? You just don't know. So what can be done about this? Well, it turns out that the way MAC clauses are structured, and this is what we're gonna look at now, the way MAC clauses are structured arguably they are directly responsive to this concern. Uh, and if so, then the purpose of the MAC clause is not, you know, only or even so much to offset the shareholder vote, it's instead to create the incentives that seller management needs to have in order to act like they're still invested in the business even when they aren't anymore. And so now we need to look at the way the MA clause works in order to see if that's true questions. All right. Um, Chantelle. Um Assume here, can you, uh, can you read part five for us?

SPEAKER 6
Uh, assume that an acquisition agreement includes the following definition of a material adverse change or MAC. A material adverse change shall mean any event change that is materially adverse to the business assets or operations of the company. Provided, however, that none of the following shall constitute a material adverse change, changes in the national or world economy or financial markets as a whole, or changes in general economic conditions that affect the industries in which the company conducts business or any change in applicable law, so long as such changes or conditions do not adversely affect the company in a materially disproportionate manner relative to other similarly situated participants in the industries or markets in which they operate.

SPEAKER 0
OK, so this is a 3-part clause. So what we need to do is we need to look at each of the 3 clauses to understand it and to see how each one interacts with the other and then ultimately what incentives does this 3-part clause create. So, like other MAC clauses, this one has 3 components. First, it says that a deal can be canceled if there is a material adverse change. So now we need part 1 of the clause. So could you identify that part for us?

SPEAKER 6
Yeah, so part one, the material adverse change just means shall meaning any event change that is materially adverse to the business assets or operations of the company.

SPEAKER 0
Perfect. That's pretty focused and narrow, isn't it? No, that's incredibly broad, right? Um, it's. Basically any event change uh that is materially adverse to the business assets or operations of the company, you know, anything, right? Anything that's bad for the business could potentially trigger this clause and I only say potentially because we now have an exception. And an exception to the exception, but if the clause just ended there, if that was it, if it just said material adverse change, shall mean any event change that is materially adverse to the business assets or operations of the company, period. Well, Chantal, in that case that's all it said. Would you say 100% of deals that are signed will close? Would you say 99%?

SPEAKER 6
I don't know if I could give a percentage, but I definitely wouldn't say such high percentages.

SPEAKER 0
A lot of deals could just be canceled, right? It's almost like an intention maybe possibly to buy rather than a commitment because you can be sure that something material is gonna change that's adverse to the business. This is very, very broad, so the initial universe of what's potentially covered here is a lot, but then this provided that clause suggests. There's an exception. So now let's turn to Part B. The relevant component of MAC clauses is a list of exceptions or carve-outs which do not justify a change. So could you quote that language for us?

SPEAKER 6
Yeah, so that's just sort of follows the first part, which is that none of the following shall constitute a material adverse change, which is changes in the national or world economy or financial markets as a whole or changes in general economic conditions. Uh, that affect the industries in which the company conducts business or any change in applicable law.

SPEAKER 0
Good. OK, so once again a very narrow category of things carved out, right? That doesn't include very much. Um, no, no, it's massive. I'm being sarcastic, right? So you've got, if anything happens, the deal is off, but if, if, if what happens is something that affects the entire economy, the regional economy, this business supplying, you know, whatever it is, changes in law. Doesn't count, right? Which means all of a sudden you have a huge universe of things that could have triggered the clause and a pretty massive universe of things that don't, right? So the, the exception pretty much swallows the rule if it ended here and so just back to you for another question so. You're selling Tiffany's to me. I'm buying it and all of a sudden it seems like there's a global recession. People just aren't buying luxury goods anymore um would that condition satisfy the first part? Is that a material adverse change?

SPEAKER 6
That would be a materially adverse change.

SPEAKER 0
And now if we look at the carve out, is this the sort of thing that the definition says doesn't count?

SPEAKER 6
Uh, ignoring the carve out of a carve, carve out, yeah, we're ignoring the carve out of the carve out.

SPEAKER 0
So yeah, I mean it's, it's a change in the global or national economy, uh, and so now if we just take a step back and think about what we expected, do you think the buyer or the seller ought to take the risk that the economy might get much worse or much better?

SPEAKER 6
I think the buyer should take on the risk, yeah,

SPEAKER 0
you know, you, you're buying this. Part of the reason you're buying it is that you are optimistic that you can run this business well in the economy that we're gonna have, but nobody can predict exactly what the economy is gonna be. You must have an implicit prediction in buying this, and you might be wrong, but those are the brakes, right? Like you would, this is without taking this class. I strongly suspect each of us would come to the conclusion that like, of course. A recession isn't a reason why you can get out of a deal. I mean, a deal is a deal and that's what a deal is for and the economy might get better and then the buyer's lucky and the economy might get worse and then the buyer is sad, but that's what happens, right? So we wouldn't have expected anything otherwise, but now we have to turn to part three. But first of all I, I hope everyone can see like super broad scope of this followed by quite a broad exception. Now we turn to the third part if you could read that.

SPEAKER 6
Yeah, so the third component creates a carve out from the carve out. Something that otherwise would be excluded can still justify termination of the deal in some circumstances. Uh, what are those circumstances? Please quote the relevant language. And so in the last part of that clause, it says, so long as such changes or conditions do not adversely affect the company in a materially disproportionate manner, uh, relative to other similarly situated participants in the industries or markets in which they operate.

SPEAKER 0
OK, so what is, what is this carveout from the carveout telling us?

SPEAKER 6
So I guess to use your Tiffany example, it's sort of like there's a recession, people aren't buying luxury goods. If Tiffany is doing significantly worse than peer luxury good groups, then like whoever's the buyer can like exit out of the deal or something.

SPEAKER 0
Right, right, so what happens is basically if there's something bad that happens and it's something that's sort of true of the world as a whole. You generally are stuck buyer. You have to buy unless the company you're buying is doing less well than other companies in the same position. So if Tiffany's is doing really badly but let's say Louis Vuitton wasn't the buyer, Louis Vuitton is doing better, then it's not the downturn in the economy that gets the buyer out of buying Tiffany's, it's the fact that the Tiffany's management is navigating this problem worse than their competitors are. People see that that's the way this language works, OK, um, Ariel. Could you help us please with um part D in the clause above, does the buyer or seller bear the risk of economic downturns and other general market conditions?

SPEAKER 7
Um, yes, I think the buyer bears the risk, um, for the general market conditions.

SPEAKER 0
It's the buyer, as we said, which then brings us to part E in the clause above. Does the buyer or seller bear the risk of firm specific problems, problems that are specific to the seller? Why? And does that allocation of risk make sense?

SPEAKER 7
Um, I think the seller bears a risk, um, and it's allocated to them. Uh, because it poses the risk on the seller, uh, which would be bad, uh, seller management.

SPEAKER 0
Good. So basically the effect of the MAC clause is to say to sellers you have to do with, with whatever happens you have to do as well as your competitors are doing. Don't necessarily have to do better, but if you're gonna do a lot worse, the deal's off and so you said it, but like what incentive effect does that have on the selling management? So Ariel what what effect does this clause have on the incentives of the selling management to do their jobs,

SPEAKER 7
um, to act as the, the rest of the market is acting, um, to be intentional, right?

SPEAKER 0
Pay attention guys, and this is squarely addressing the problem that we were discussing before. hey, once I sold it's your problem. I'm going home early. I don't really care anymore. Well, if you, if you act that way, then the deal may not actually be on and the business might not have been sold and you may actually be on the hook for all of this. So it's a way to try to incentivize the selling management team. To keep working as well as they have before to maintain the properties in a way that the buyer wants them maintained uh out of self interest because presumably they want the sale to go through and if they don't keep doing their jobs the sale might be at risk and so the idea is another reason for the MAC clause is is a way to motivate. Selling management uh to keep doing their jobs all the way to the closing. People see that? So again, we're dealing with incentive problems that can otherwise interfere with transactions that could be good for both sides very much in the spirit of what we've been talking about, uh. So, let's see. Do it. OK, um, we're now on part. Uh, I think, I think, right? Yes. Can you read part F for us? Assume that the language above was used.

SPEAKER 8
Yeah, um, assume that the language above was used in a deal that closed in October of 2019. Assume the seller is an online retailer that delivers groceries and other products to people's homes. Assume that the pandemic has increased demand for the seller's services but reduced its profitability because costs are higher. Under this MA clause is the buyer able to back out? And I apologize that really should say signed, signed in

SPEAKER 0
October of 2019, and we're gonna assume that the period between signing and closing includes the beginning of the pandemic, so I apologize about that, uh, and so what do you think?

SPEAKER 8
Yeah, so, um. Kind of following like the three part, uh, Mac like that we broke it down to. So was there an adverse change? Yes, but does a carveout apply? I think so, uh, because there is a change in the national world economy or financial markets, so that definitely applies. But then we do the carve out to the carve out. Um, is this particular, uh, retailer disproportionately impacted? I don't think so. So I, I don't think they'd be able to back out.

SPEAKER 0
Good. And so this is, that's exactly the analysis. This is the question. Um, the mere fact that there's a pandemic wouldn't in the analysis. What we would want to know is. And, and, um, by the way you could even say well it's not even an adverse change because it's increased demand but although it's increased demand it's reduced profitability so I think it is an adverse change uh but we wanna know like how are the other online businesses doing and if they're doing about as well as everybody else then the deal is on um can you help us with part. Uh, yeah, uh, same as F, but the seller's an

SPEAKER 8
airline that has no local routes and runs only international flights. These routes connecting the US to Europe and Asia have all been canceled under this MAC clause. Is the buyer able to back out. Um, here, I think it. It, it really depends on what we're comparing the airline to. If it's like international airline to another international airline, then probably not. Uh, you wouldn't be able to cancel, um, uh, or get out of the, the deal. But if the, the peer group is like an airline that provides both domestic and international flights, then definitely you could say you make the argument that this airline's like disproportionately affected. But assuming we're comparing it to just another identical international carrier, no, I don't think so.

SPEAKER 0
Good. So that's the perfect answer. And the answer is unfortunately it's unclear. And it's unclear for exactly the good analysis for the reasons you just outlined, um, what is the benchmark? What is the comparison set that we're supposed to use here? Because the premise of this clause is compare this business with similar businesses, but we can define similar businesses in two ways. Way number 1. Airlines with only international routes, they're all shut down. There's no there are virtually no international flights anywhere in the world. They're all doing disastrously badly. You can't get out of this because as a buyer, because the seller's doing miserably, but so are all the other businesses just like it. On the other hand, if we can say no, the comparison is not. Airlines with only international routes, it's just airlines. Well, airlines that had domestic routes, they had some flights going, they were doing better. This airline would look worse by comparison, so you can be certain that buyers are gonna say look at how much worse you're doing. Than your peers with uh domestic flights and then the seller's gonna say they're not my peers they have domestic flights. I have only international flights you knew that when you contracted to buy me and the only other airlines like me are A, B, and C and they're doing just as badly. And so how's this gonna get resolved? Well, could be litigation, right? And so this is a bit of a cautionary tale about how although you can try to sort of create the right incentives and draft it in a way that you think is gonna work, there's still this ambiguity here which is about but but what's the comparison set and there will be strategic reasons. Why the two sides will have strong incentives to define that differently. Um, Mohammed. Can you help us with the next one, which is actually somewhat similar part H? Uh, which is assume the seller owns a chain of restaurants. And if you prefer for me to come back to you, I can. Yes, please, sure, OK, um, Aditi, can you help us please with this one? It's Part H. Assume the seller owns a chain of restaurants.

SPEAKER 9
Sure, um, assume the seller owns a chain of restaurants across the United States and assume there's an act of terrorism in Metropolis, a major US city where half of the seller's restaurants are located. In response to the act of terrorism, consumers in Metropolis are more cautious and many stop going to restaurants, but consumers in other cities do not change their behavior. Can the buyer invoke this to get out of the deal? Um, I think with this one. It also kind of depends or it's less clear because you're looking at what. You're comparing the restaurants to, so if you're looking at other restaurants within that same city, um, Then, you know, the buyer probably couldn't get out of it, but if you're comparing it to the US as a whole, then, um, the seller might be on the hook for that.

SPEAKER 0
Exactly. So we have the same. Ambiguity here again the purpose of the clause is keep up with your competitors and the challenge with the clause is but who are my competitors and you can easily imagine exactly as you said that uh the buyer is gonna say look at. How much worse you're doing than these other national restaurant chains and then the buyer is gonna say well well sure because they're national and this particular issue it struck harder in the city which is where we mostly are compare us to other restaurants in our city and you'll see that we're doing just as well and um how does this end up? Well, you could again imagine. Litigation, right? Or uh maybe a grudging settlement at the end of all this, but it's not gonna be entirely clear. Um, questions. OK, so we've been looking at the pandemic uh as just uh an example, but we've been looking more fundamentally at this idea of incentive problems that can arise in an acquisition. Uh, and there are incentive problems that can arise where people won't bid, and that's what the symmetry rationale for the MAC clause is designed to address. And then you can imagine a different set of incentive problems having to do with the selling management and whether they will continue to really try very hard to make the business successful even after the contract is signed. And I think the MAC clause can also be viewed as responsive to that. My own opinion is that if you look at the precise mechanics of the clause, it seems pretty focused on that second, right? The fact that it says anything bad is potentially gonna get you out of the deal, but not if it's general, only if it's specific and you're doing less well than everybody else. It really does seem like a contractual mechanism to encourage the selling management to keep performing. Um, so you know if you ask me which do I think is a better explanation, probably the second, but the first also works in its way and doesn't mean that a clause has only one reason to be in a contract. Sometimes it's serving multiple purposes. So what I wanna do in a second, uh, is to now turn to, uh, theme number 2 in our class which is regulatory arbitrage. And so we're gonna look at something that Congress, US Congress did. During the pandemic, um, but really the purpose of this is absolutely not to understand the relevant tax rules. The fun of it is if you think it's fun again, my, my taste may be different from the mainstream. Um, but what I view is fun about this is what we're really looking at is incentive and information problems that arise in trying to claim and share a tax benefit. So really this continues to be a discussion of incentive and information problems, but it's a way in which the two themes. Intersect because sometimes in order to take advantage of um a regulatory arbitrage opportunity like a tax break um you need to cooperate and then there will be a lack of trust and strategic um maneuvering on the part of both sides which might prevent the parties from actually claiming the benefit or maybe they will be able to claim it and so that's what we're gonna look at in a second. But first, any questions or comments about anything so far? OK. Adam. Uh, can you help us please? So we're gonna turn to this part, the economic value of a tax deduction, uh, is the amount of tax that it allows you to avoid and just is a, uh, sort of a baseline setting point, uh, because I know many of you have not taken tax, you don't need to have taken tax. So the point is, um, the US income tax and income taxes in other jurisdictions, they don't just tax you for bringing in money. They tax you for making a profit so if I decided to try to sell sandwiches outside the law school, um, what I would need to do is I would need to rent a truck and I'd need to pay for the ingredients in the sandwiches and I would need to maybe hire other people to help me. They can serve the sandwiches and so even though I might charge $10 a sandwich and I might have 500 students uh buy sandwiches, so 500 times 10 I might have $5000 of revenue. Will I make a $5000 profit? No, of course not, because I have to pay the rent for the truck. I need to pay for the ingredients. I need to pay my employees. And so the idea is maybe the costs are $3000 and the revenue is 5. 5000 and so I'm getting 2000 on the day which would be a 40% profit margin that would be enormous so that seems vastly overstated um but nevertheless, the point is we have to subtract the cost of earning the money and that's what the tax system calls a deduction. A deduction means in my example they won't tax you on 5000, they'll tax you on you know the $5000 is is it's called gross income. It's the amount that came in, but it's not so-called taxable income, the amount you pay tax on you start with what's coming in, the $5000 you subtract the costs of earning the $5000 that's the $3000. And those are your deductions. I would deduct the salary of my employee. I would deduct their ingredients, the cost of the truck, and that leads me, you know, gross income minus deductions equals taxable income. So what is the value? Of a deduction, so if I pay $100 of salary to my employee for a day, do I save $100 of tax? I spend $100 on the salary. Do I save $100 of tax? And the answer is no, right? How much, uh, do I save? Well, it depends upon the tax rate, right? So if I have a 20% tax rate, let's just say it's a 20% tax rate, and um I pay $100 to my employee. Then what that means is there's $100 of revenue that I'm not paying tax on. I hope you can see that because I'm gonna deduct that $100 that's the payment to my, my colleague, uh, my employee, but how much tax does that save me? Not $100. It's the tax I would have paid on the $100 of income if my rate is 20%, then I'm saving $20 of tax. OK, so the point is, what's the value of a dollar of deduction? Not the full dollar, it's the tax rate times the dollar. If the tax rate goes up and all of a sudden now the tax is 30%, not 20%, my deduction is now worth $30 instead of $20. But again, how do you know the value of a deduction? It's the tax rate. The tax rate times the deduction is the tax that you would have paid without it and therefore it's the financial value of the deduction. Does everybody see that? So what I hope you can also see is the desirability, how valuable a deduction is. It goes up with a higher tax rate. It goes down with a lower tax rate because it's all about the tax that you avoid paying. So Adam, back to you, um, is the ability to deduct $1 of expense worth $1. No, like we just said, like the value is the tax rate times the dollar. Perfect. So the answer is no. You, you need to know the tax rate. So the dollar, unless the tax rate is 100% saving a dollar, you know, a dollar's, uh, deduction is not gonna be worth a dollar in tax savings. Part B, assume that a corporation's tax rate is 21%. If the corporation earns a dollar, how much tax must the corporation pay? That would be 21 cents. 21 cents, right? We're paying 21% of our dollar, 21 cents. Part C, assume now that the corporation is able to deduct $1 of expense. How much tax does the corporation avoid? What is the economic value of a dollar deduction? So they avoid that 21 cents, so I guess that's how much they make theoretically. The economic value of the dollar deduction is given by that 21% tax rate. It's 21 cents. Everybody see that? OK. And then the last question, please fill in the blank. The economic value of a deduction depends on the taxpayer's tax rate. Tax rate, perfect. The marginal tax rate, the tax that would apply to that next dollar, that's the key point. Everybody see it? OK, so now the idea is we're gonna find ways to get deductions that we didn't have before. We're gonna have to cooperate in order to claim them, and the parties may have adverse interests and can it work out, uh, but we have to set the stage with the relevant background. So let's do that. So Nikki, can I ask for your help? And we're now at this question in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Do you see where we are? Um, OK, if you can read that in part A. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the US Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act. One of its provisions enabled taxpayers to carry back net operating losses. As background, let's cover a few basics of how NOLs are taxed in the US. So pardon. Um, assume that corporation has $9 million of revenue in 2020 and $10 million of expenses. Do you expect the corporation to pay any tax in 2020? Um, I do not believe so because they lost a lot more money, right, so even though they had $9 million of revenue, they had $10 million of deductible expenses, which means they can use $9 million of those deductions, cancel out all the $9 million of revenue, which leaves them with an extra $1 million of deductions, right? And that is known as a net operating loss, and net operating loss means how much your deductions exceed your income in a year. And so that's why the word net comes into place. They have 10 million of deductions, but their net deductions, once they offset the income, that's a million net operating losses, it's when you have more costs, more deductions, then you have income. And you know without the tax system you just say you lost money and this is how much but there's tax significance to the idea of having the so-called net loss, the net operating loss, and we need to know what to do with that, OK? Does everybody see what we're talking about? OK, um, so. What happens? How is its net operating loss of a million dollars treated? The US corporate rate is 21%. So does the government send you a $210,000 check because you have this million dollars of loss and the government usually bears 21% of the loss? Uh, I don't think so. I think it's just deductive in the future. Good, so the point is the US and other jurisdictions that I know about will not give you a current refund for losing money, right? They don't, and, and arguably they should, by the way, because like just remember if I make more than I spend. Are they gonna tax me currently on that? Yes, so they're my partner when things go well, and it's they're, they're my 21% partner in the US and if things go badly and they're really your partner they should absorb the 21% loss when I have a loss, but governments have not. Be willing to do this and it actually creates some distortions and problems in the economy that they're not willing to do this but in any event you don't get a current refund for having extra deductions beyond your income and you said it, but what do we generally do with those deductions? You just they carry on to a later year, right? So we save them we saved them for a future year, but used to be that we could do more with them so let's turn to that but first I hope everyone can see in net operating loss you have more deductions than income. The US and other generally other tax treatment is you don't get a current refund for that but you can use it in a different tax year. It doesn't go away completely. So now we turn to part C, um, starting in 2018, um. US corporations with NOLs, you know, more deductions than income can only carry them forward, carry forward those losses. Carrybacks were no longer allowed. So what's the difference between a carry forward and a carry back? Um, so carry forward just seems to be using this now operating loss on, um, like future years. And Carry back, it seems a little weird to me, but I guess you can go. Back, right? Good. So have you ever read the Harry Potter books? Yeah, when I was a lot younger. Do you remember the reference to a time turner where you can go back in time? Sure. The US taxes, no, no, never mind, this is just my personal fantasy so it's a little strange, right? What does it mean that you get to use it in a prior year, right? Because carry forward means save it for next year or for some later year when you finally have profits again. A carry back means no, no, no, you can go back to a prior year and the good news is you don't have to actually travel through time. So here's the thing when a corporation. In our example, it's 2020. Did they file a 2019 tax return? Yeah, they probably, I mean if they don't wanna go to jail they do so yes they did, right? It's possible they had profits in 2019, right? Um, if they did then a so-called carry back just means you can amend the return you already filed. I filed a return for last year. We paid the government some money we made money that year. The government, uh, got its share, but with a carry back we can say, hey government, we were, we were wrong because what we did is we paid our taxes based on what happened in that year. But thanks to you government, thanks very much, we can amend our return and incorporate this additional deduction from 2020, carry it back to 2019, and we can. Um, we can claim a deduction now, which means we'll get a refund from last year's taxes. OK, so the difference between a carry back and a carry forward is a carry forward means can't do anything with this yet. You'll have to wait for a profitable year, hopefully it's next year, won't necessarily be, but whenever you have profits again, these losses will be there in your bank and you'll use them and you won't pay tax then. That's the carry forward. The carry back means no no no you don't have to wait for the future find a year in the past when you made money amend your return and then get a refund from that return because actually now that we know that you not only had what happened that year but also this extra loss from the future you can get your deduction now you can get a refund now so that has implications which we're gonna talk about but I think maybe we'll save them for. We uh Wednesday, today's Monday. So on Wednesday we're gonna continue with this discussion and then depending on um how it goes, we may or may not start venture capital.
