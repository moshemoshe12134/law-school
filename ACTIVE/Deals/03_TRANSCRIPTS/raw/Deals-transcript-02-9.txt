SPEAKER 0
out. Thank you. OK. That. Oh Hey, everybody.

SPEAKER 1
Uh, Professor Shizzer is gonna be about 10 minutes or maybe now like 8 minutes late. Um, so he emailed me, said, um, You guys can just like hang out if you'd rather, or we can do like a, just like an open Q&A if there's any questions people have that like maybe you haven't been able to come to office hours for, happy to answer that. Um. Otherwise, no worries. Um, one thing on my end actually, there's like a, um, like a budget I have, we can use for office hours. It's like $15 a student. So I'm gonna send out a form every week, just fill that out if you plan to come. Um. Uh, I don't exactly understand the constraints, but, um, there's some. So basically, just fill that out and actually come if you plan, but you don't really need to like, you know, ask any questions or anything. Just if you want the, your, you know, food or snacks or whatever, I'll bring, depending on how many people fill it out and just, just show up and grab it and you can leave. All right. Any questions? We'll just otherwise hang for a few minutes and um yeah, question here. No, Wednesdays at 3. yep, uh, it should be on the syllabus. I actually don't know the answer. Does anybody have that readily available? Should be on the syllabus. If not, email me and I'll, I'll post his office hours as well. Yes Thursday. Thursday is 2:45. Thank you.

SPEAKER 0
No Hey, thank you, just didn't want you. They. Councilors. You found. Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
All right, actually, If you guys don't mind, I just got a question over email, um, and to make it seem like I actually contributed some value to your, your lives instead of wasting 15 minutes, I will talk about like briefly, the, what I would think about like in terms of the exam, which is like I think somewhat useful. Um. Basically, like, Professor Scher doesn't do um practice exams or like past exams or anything along those lines. The exam tracks like the discussion questions pretty closely in the way that like that, uh, that is the best way to prepare, honestly, is like really come through those, I can understand them. And he's just gonna ask you to apply the strategies and concepts from what we've learned about in all these other units to like a new, new fact patterns that he's going to come up with during the, the exam. So. Like, for example, and I've talked to a couple of students about this. Um, if it, if it like we learned about, um, like regulatory arbitrage and like different when you, if you go to buy a house like the seller and buyer have different information. And You'll like, lawyers are there to like solve these kind of like discrepancies and get transactions done. And the idea is like, OK, like, can you see what the tools the lawyers used in like buying the house to help like Fred buy a house? And can you apply that to like a different industry or this other scenario that, um that he's going to give you on the exam. So they're like structure of mine was kind of like, and he'll talk about this more as we get closer, but Structure of mine was like 3 questions, like 3 fact patterns. Each fact pattern has like sub-questions kind of that like progress you through. So almost like pull out the issues for you a little bit. Like it'll be like, first, he goes to buy the house and like, there's a problem with like the pool, right? And so like, what do you, what would you advise him to do? And then there's another issue that he runs into where like, The seller is like trying to misrepresent something to him and like how do you want to push back on that to um kind of like advance, you know, the, the transaction, make sure your client, the overall goal of like maximizing um value for your client and like getting in the best deal or her. Um. Does that make sense to everybody? I mean, we'll talk about it more when we get closer and feel free to like come to office hours regarding that as well. But I think it's mainly like focus on discussion questions for now. Like I wouldn't worry about too much about like past exams or anything. I, someone told me that there's one in the Senate Bank from like the 90s, like go for it if you want, but I, I don't really think that's gonna do much. Um Yeah, and the overall like idea of the classes you have these like information incentive, regulatory problems. Lawyers are there like to bring the solutions to those problems and they apply in all different kinds of industries and we're gonna look at like movie industry and like the uh literary industry and buying a house and, and all of these different like M&A deals, all these different things. And can you like understand what those strategies are and apply them to like a new set of, of facts. It's, it's, it's pretty straightforward, um, overall, but, you know, obviously, um, I'm here for, for any questions. So questions regarding the exam or any follow-ups to that, that comment. All right, awesome. Yes, one. There we go. Usually houses Yeah, short answer, it's not gonna be a multiple-choice situation. Um. Uh, at least in my, in my experience, it wasn't, um. And if it was a multiple choice like situation, Professor Shizzer would, would tell you that, but I think that's probably not gonna be the case. Um, short answer, I mean, you'll, you'll, you'll, you'll know more when we get closer to it. I think another thing Profe Professor Shizzer did when, uh, on our exam was like give general time, like guidelines on how long to spend on each one. So he'll tell you if that's true or not. But I, I think that happened to ours. And the other last minute ones while we get set up here. All right. Thank you for your attention. See you later.

SPEAKER 0
Thanks, Danny, thanks so much. I noticed that I never get applause. Yeah. I do apologize, everybody. Danny, thank you so much, and again, sorry I'm late. So we've been, oh, let me get this on. We've been talking about mergers and acquisitions. We began. OK, this one's working right? Good, we've been talking about mergers and acquisitions. Basically where we started was with the idea that sometimes an acquisition can be prompted by incentive and information problems that are associated with contracting with a third party. Might make a lot of sense in principle for a law firm to have fewer full time employees and instead to focus on hiring outsiders just for a particular task but uh the problem is the incentives of those temporary lawyers are potentially not what you want and also the um. The um Sorry, the, um. Uh, you don't know a lot about them. About their quality so the idea is in this make or buy discussion you may decide that make is better uh than uh. Than buy and so you should just go ahead and uh produce things in house but in that situation you then uh need to understand better than you're likely to just exactly what you're buying and that brings us to this challenge of due diligence and I mentioned the analogy to the game of Battleship where basically you ask a lot of questions you try to get as much insight as you can about where the problems aren't. So that you can then find out where you should focus your energies and this is why lots and lots of paper goes back and forth the vast vast majority of representations, the, the seller will just say yes to that, yes, I can give this representation, and it's really when they can't that things get interesting and so really that's, uh, an effort to try to manage incentive and especially information problems before the deal actually goes ahead. Now due diligence looks a little bit different depending on deal structure, which is the next issue, and we had just started to talk about it and there's this difference between stock deals and asset deals so um the structural difference is that if you're a buyer and it's a stock deal you're transacting with shareholders, you're buying their shares and you will eventually own the corporation that has the business inside it. So if the buyer is a corporation, the um the the target is going to become a subsidiary of the corporation. If the buyer is a living breathing human being, they'll have a wholly owned company, um, but basically you're dealing with shareholders and what that means is that you're gonna own not just the assets of the business but the corporation that's gonna have significance as we'll see um the other possibility is you buy the assets. Of the business, not the corporation holding it in that case your counterparty in the deal is the corporation itself, not its owners, uh, and then what you do is you have a collection of assets you're likely to drop them into your own corporation either an existing one or one that you formed for the purpose, but due diligence can look a little bit different and the stakes are different in one as opposed to the other and so, uh, unless I'm mistaken, I think we were at 4B. Grade 4B and discussion questions number 4. Does that seem right to people? Great. OK. So, uh, this is panel number 3. Um, and so. Uh, is it? It's number 3, isn't it? Yes, OK, um, Shelby, can I ask for your help, please on this? So for B, assume that seller did not properly file a patent. Does the buyer need to worry about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock deal? Uh, it's Part B of 4B. So it's, uh, seller did not properly file a patent. Does the buyer need to worry about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock deal? I think in a stock deal, they should be worried about it because if they're not filing properly, then it has to do with like what a company owns or doesn't own and so in that case, it can like interfere with what. You're actually acquiring and what you're not acquiring. So in a stock deal, it matters. What about in an asset deal you're buying this patent? Does it matter if it was properly filed? I think, yeah, it still would matter too. The quality of the assets matters in both a stock deal and an asset deal. This. The idea about whether a patent would file is just an example of that, but the broader, uh, and, you know, a patent that wasn't properly filed doesn't offer the legal protection that you think it offers is a low quality patent, but it's just one example of a more general point. The quality of the assets is equally important in either transaction, um, Samantha. Can you help us with 4C? Uh, this one is a bit more nuanced. Assume seller. Selling corporation has a cheap lease, but if seller no longer is no longer the counterparty on the lease, the lease expires. Does buyer need to worry about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock deal? Um, I would think in an asset deal they would need to worry maybe more than a stock deal. I, I agree. Um, I think, uh, because the lease wouldn't, uh, The buyer could lose the lease entirely if the seller is not a counterparty in the first case, whereas um an ownership change wouldn't really affect it wouldn't affect the actual lease in the stock deal. Good. So the idea is here we have a contract that the business you're buying is a party to, and it's a favorable contract. The market has moved in a direction that makes this trend this this contract desirable. Maybe part of the reason you want to buy. This business is it has all these leases it's, it's a coffee chain and they negotiated a lot of leases during the pandemic which are now very much below market so the stores are making extra money. Uh, you'd like to keep those leases in place so if you buy assets. Then the lease doesn't apply to you because you're not the corporation that is the counterparty on the lease it's the selling corporation that uh entered into those leases and so you could imagine the lease is terminating, which means here an asset deal would be less good than a stock deal because there are these contracts that you would lose. In contrast with a stock deal, technically the corporation that is a counterparty on these leases will continue. It's just it has a new owner. You will own the corporation instead of the other people owning the corporation, but it's the same corporation that that the corporate identity on the lease isn't changing. Now there's a caveat here, which is that occasionally what you will see is a so-called change of control provision in a lease so that even if you're doing a stock deal and the corporation that you're buying is the counterparty on the lease, you might still lose the lease because the lease might have a special provision saying that if the owners of the corporation change, then the lease goes away. This is rare. But it does exist, something you'd want to know when you were buying the company, because if you thought you had a stock deal and you didn't have to worry about it, there is this rare situation where it could matter, but that's an exception to the general point that I'm hoping you'll see, which is if what you're trying to do is step into the shoes on contracts that are favorable, a stock deal is generally going to be better for you than an asset deal. And just more generally, uh, the deal changes depending on whether it's a stock or an asset deal, and the things that you need to know are a little bit different. Um, great, Samantha, thank you. Um, Ari. Can you help us with the next one, which is Part D? Assume that the seller has not paid its taxes for 3 years. Does the buyer need to worry about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock deal? Um, in an asset deal, the buyer is not worried because they do not take on the seller's tax liabilities. But in the, in the stockdale, the buyer does need to worry because the seller's unpaid taxes could affect the company and therefore the, the buyer. Good. So this is the mirror image of the problem of the, you know, the issue we were just discussing, um, are you buying the company or are you buying the assets of the company? When you buy the corporation itself, you can step into the shoes of its contracts that are good, but you're also stepping into the shoes of its liabilities that are bad, right? A stock deal means that the liabilities of the seller are coming over to you. Whereas in an asset deal they generally don't, I say generally because as with so many things there's a slight exception here, something known as a tax lien if the seller owes you owes the government money, then the government will say that it has a lien, it has a security interest in the property. Of uh the seller now this is probably not gonna be a problem for you because you're you're paying to get the business and usually that tax lien will jump from the assets that they're selling to the proceeds so I I think the analysis we just offered is usually correct anyway but you know really nothing is so simple. But on the other hand, this is perhaps the most important difference between a stock deal and an asset deal, uh, and so. Um, so, hey, back to you, um, you are, uh, a senior person at a law firm and you are coming in on a Friday afternoon, uh, to break the news to someone that, hey, there's a deal that just, you know, it's been in abeyance for a while but it's heating up, it's gonna close over the weekend and this person needs to coordinate completing the due diligence on the deal. Uh, and so, you know, nobody loves to hear that their weekend plans have been disrupted because there's a, a deal they have to help finish. Um, do you think that it sounds better or worse if it's a stock deal or an asset deal? Does one of them seem a bit easier to get done than the other. The The asset deal is the lighter lift, and I still have vivid memories, although it's been decades for me now, but where people would come in and say sorry, we have this deal, it's closing, we need you to finish it for us, but the good news, it's an asset deal, so it won't be as hard now. Bit of an overstatement. It was never great news, but I think the point is there's a whole set of issues with an asset deal that you don't worry about in the same way. Does the seller have liabilities? Well, they remain with the seller. We're not taking them over. We don't have to know quite as much about that. So the, the intensity of the due diligence can vary a bit depending on deal structure, and that's a key aspect of it um. Yeah, see fun here, not today, OK, uh, Bart. So can you help us then with part E, assume that.

SPEAKER 2
So assume that one of the seller's employees made inappropriate jokes in the workplace and seller just terminated his employment. Does buyer need to worry about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock deal? So for an asset deal, I think um unless the employment contracts are part of the part of the asset deal, the buyer generally does not need to worry. But in a in a stock deal, the buyer definitely needs to About this because the employment termination can impact the company which the buyer now owns.

SPEAKER 0
Good, so there can be liabilities caused by uh this terminated employee and those liabilities could be a problem going forward. Someone might bring a lawsuit. There might be damages, expenses of defending, all the rest, and the idea is if this is a stock deal. Then that really ought to be something you wanna know because you'll own the company that you know is gonna be a judged to have that liability if it's an asset deal, it's not something you would need to worry about that problem will remain with the selling corporation, but the assets won't bring it along. Notice the importance though of the idea that this person has been terminated. If they still work for you, then they could create similar issues while you own the business and so you know then you're not uh you're not and you you would have to focus on it but again another reason why asset deals are more straightforward than stock deals the liabilities do not travel with the business in the same way. Art, can you help us with the next one too, uh, Part F.

SPEAKER 2
Assume buyer is buying a drug patent from a seller. There is uncertainty about whether the drug will work, so buyer is paying a first installment buyer has not paid its taxes for 3 years.

SPEAKER 0
The seller need to worry about this in an asset. What about in a stock?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, um, sorry about that. For an asset deal, the buyer usually does not need to worry. Um, I mean, assuming that the taxes mentioned in this question is the corporate income tax, then I think the buyer does not need to worry, but if it's a, uh, if the taxes are related to the asset, then it definitely needs to worry. For a stock deal, definitely needs to worry because those unpaid taxes remain liabilities of the seller which buyer now owns.

SPEAKER 0
So I think the point here is it's the buyer that has a problem and the seller is selling either stock or assets to the buyer. Once the seller sells, they're out and all they care about is are they getting paid. So I think generally the buyer's issues are not relevant to the seller in either structure. Basically all the seller needs to know is do you have the money to pay me. And presumably they do again there's this issue of tax liens again and maybe the cash they wanted to use the government would say no that's our cash but again if they're assets coming over and the tax lien jumps over I think mostly. The um uh the buyer's liabilities, tax or otherwise, are not going to be relevant to the seller, but there is an exception to that, and it depends. The hint is it depends on how the seller is getting paid. So does anybody know like when would you have a situation where it's not just the buyer doing due diligence about the seller, but the seller also doing due diligence about the buyer? Addison, go ahead. Is it if the buyer is buying it with stocks of their own company? Yes, yes, which is not unusual, right? Uh, sometimes the way an acquisition is done is the buyer provides stock in itself, which means that the seller becomes the shareholder of the buyer. In that case, actually, the, uh, you know, the sellers should be digging deep into the businesses and liabilities of the buyer so they understand what it means to get paid with the buyer's stock, but that's just a special situation. Usually the buyer's situation doesn't matter. Um, but, all right, let's just finish up with, uh, part G, please.

SPEAKER 2
I'm sorry, part G?

SPEAKER 0
Uh, yeah, that you started to read it before. Assume buyer is drawing a book, a drug patent from seller.

SPEAKER 2
Yes, um, wait. Assume buyer is buying a drug patent from a seller. There is uncertainty about whether the drug will work, so buyer is paying a first installment now and will pay another amount in 2 years. The amount of this payment will depend on whether the drug works. Assume also that the buyer has not paid its taxes for 3 years. The seller need to worry about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock deal? So, Um, for this question, since the seller is not getting paid all at once, uh, oh, wait. That's right. Yeah, um, seller must do DD on the buyer to make sure that the buyer will have the ability to pay at the time the money is owed.

SPEAKER 0
Exactly right. Exactly right. And here this is true whether it's a stock deal or an asset deal. It's really a question of the credit worthiness of the buyer. And as I said before, generally what you care about as a seller is can the buyer pay me? And if they have the money now and they're paying you everything now, that's what you need to know. But if some of the purchase price is coming later, then in effect you're lending money to the buyer in the form of hey, pay me later, um, and in that way you suddenly care about their credit worthiness, which means their liabilities would matter, right? OK. All right, so we've been looking at how deal structure can affect these information asymmetries and how hard you have to work to fix them. Um, let's turn now to, uh, a more general question about whether due diligence is cooperative or adversarial, so we're gonna spend a few minutes on that. Uh, Zachary, can you help us please with part 5 seller is negotiating.

SPEAKER 3
Seller is negotiating to sell a theme park to buyer. It used to be very popular, but lately it has not been drawing the same crowds. Seller has built a new ride based on a popular video game which will be the subject of a movie that will be released after the sale closes. Seller has produced the game for many years. And also is producing the movie The Ride. Won't open until after the movie opens. And therefore until after the sale. Buyer asked for information about the game, including the number of users over the past several years. Why do you think buyer wants this information? Do you think the seller should provide it? Um So the buyer's gonna want this because it's gonna inform the buyer of how popular the ride is, um, and that can help with the valuation of the park also.

SPEAKER 0
Exactly, so from the buyer's perspective what they're really betting on is that this ride will turn things around. The theme park hasn't been doing so well, but if they can tap into this big cohort of fans, then that might actually mean this place will become more successful, which means they could afford to pay a bit more for it. Um, should the, um, seller be interested to share this information?

SPEAKER 3
If they don't share it, they're gonna imply that it's not good numbers for the video game. So they should share it.

SPEAKER 0
Good. And um I mean it's pretty straightforward if it's actually a lot of people and it's good news. Sellers always wanna share good news. Uh, you were right to get into another scenario which is, well, what if it's not good news? Do you still have reasons to share it? And we're gonna get into that too in a minute, um, but at least to the extent that this is good news, it's a no brainer, of course you wanna share that, um, part D.

SPEAKER 3
Ron Gilson has argued that due diligence should be a cooperative process since the parties have shared interests. Does the example in A support his view? I'd say yes, um, sharing good news.

SPEAKER 0
The seller wants to do it. The buyer wants to know. Seems pretty cooperative. Good. Now let's turn to part C.

SPEAKER 3
Bayer asks for information about the movie which again has not been released, including information about the reaction of focus groups who have seen it. Why do you think buyer wants this information? Why might seller be more concerned about addressing buyer's questions about the movie? Hint, is there a difference between offering facts on the one hand and predictions on the other. Um. Yeah, um, predictions are less reliable than facts. Um If the focus group loves the movie, then. The seller will be more willing to share the information and try to get the buyer to pay more, um, but if the focus group does not like the movie, then. The seller won't want to share that information.

SPEAKER 0
Right, so, uh, so far what we've established is that when the news is good, this is easy. When the news is bad, it becomes a bit more murky. And so the next question is gonna have us drill down into that. Jason, can you help us please with this part six about Carol? OK. Uh, Carol is an entrepreneur who is developing a cure for the common cold. She would like to sell her company, seller to Bayer, a pharmaceutical company. Doug, who works for Bayer, wants to see the clinical trials for the new drug. Carol knows that the results are mixed. They suggest that the drug does not, uh, does cure cold, but they also suggest that the drug may have some serious side effects. Part A, without any legal constraints, what would Carol, or indeed an an an ethical version of Carol want to say about the trials? Does she have an incentive to share good news? What about bad news? I think um an unethical version of Carol would definitely only share the good news, right? You'd say the trials say. That it works, it does cure colds, and then if she could, the unethical version of her would then love to leave out the part, of course it might kill you. Because that part maybe depresses the value of it, um, but the point is, uh, in a world without any law whatsoever, unethical people would be inclined to disclose selectively or frankly lie. And so what we have to assume for our purposes is because this is often true in a commercial context, you can't lie. Because lying means they can sue you and the whole deal gets undone and all the rest and maybe worse things than that, um, but there are times when you can just decline to answer so that's the those are the sort of rules of the road that we're gonna assume right now is if you say something it has to be true, but um you don't have an obligation, an affirmative obligation to disclose everything. There are times when you can say you don't want to. Um So, we've just answered B. Can Carol simply share the good news but lie about the bad news? No. And she, she can't do that. So now let's turn to part C, Jason. Uh, does Carol face any legal liability if she simply refuses to share any information about the trials? If Carol refuses, what will Doug assume about the trials? Uh, I think there's no legal obligation for, um, uh, for her to share any information about the trials in the first place. So by refusing to share the information, Um, she wouldn't be facing any legal liability. So if, uh, but practically if Carol refuses, Doug will assume the worst, um, from, um, you know, this such refusal, right? and Zachary, I think you were saying something about this before. So even though in a commercial setting we often have the freedom to say I'm, I'm actually not gonna answer that question, it's not a cost free choice because our counterparty is gonna think, whoa, why is it they don't wanna tell us. Must be because it's bad news, so I think we'll treat them as having told us. That the news is bad, even though they didn't, they say they didn't tell us anything, but they actually really did, um. And so now part D, uh, given your answer, the sellers have an incentive to share bad news as well as good news. Uh, I think the seller has the incentive to share the bad news because it can help the sellers and buyer reach, um, you know, more authentic, you know, uh, valuation of the company and we'll also, um, well do we want an authentic valuation? Don't we want an inflated valuation if we're the seller, because if this deal doesn't, uh, go through, the seller may have to go to the market to find another buyer. So this kind of thing will find, uh, light eventually, so. Um, OK, uh, but I think you said something before, so if she doesn't disclose the bad news, what are people going to assume? Assuming the worst, assuming the worst, yeah, both the current buyer and the potential buyers. Good. And when we say assume the worst, is all bad news equally bad, or are there degrees of bad? Um, there are some are deal breakers, but some are. Some are um not, not equally bad, right? So if we think about the, the side effects here, I mean one version of the side effects is it kills you, as I said before, that's pretty bad. Um, another version is it kills not only you but your entire family even worse. Another version is it causes you a rash and some discomfort. Still another is it might cause you a rash, but they think they may be able to fix the drug so it doesn't. None of these are happy facts, but what I hope you can see is that some are distinctly more sobering and negative than another. And if you were the buyer trying to decide how to, you know, you could say, given this, I don't want to buy, but the world isn't so simple, it's more likely we're still interested. To buy, but I think we need to adjust the price. We're gonna bring the price down now, uh, if it's bad enough they won't buy, but if it's moderately bad they'll buy at a discount. If it's only slightly bad they'll buy at a smaller discount. So I hope you can, you can all see that basically, um, so now, uh, Jason back to you. So if you won't say. And the buyer has to figure out what your silence means. True or false, the buyer's probably gonna assume, well, it must be a small thing. It, it couldn't be the worst thing, right? It's probably just this minor little thing like the rash that'll go away, the whole kill you and your whole family and your whole city like that, they probably tell me if that was true, right? So we'll assume that that isn't so bad. Do you agree? Don't agree. No, no, they're gonna assume the worst, right? Like, OK, if they're if they're completely silent and they're stonewalling, this is catastrophic news. We should either walk away or offer a tiny fraction of what we thought we were gonna pay, right? So if that's the way your potential buyer is likely to react, do you as a seller now have an incentive to disclose bad news? Yes, why? Um, because, um, It will, uh, it's just, uh, it's also a gesture to show to the buyer that you are being frank and you are not hiding anything and you know it kind of boosts your credibility with so it definitely boosts credibility, but I also think that in the context of the problem we were just discussing degrees of bad. What are people going to assume if you say nothing, a little bad or a lot bad? So maybe saying nothing means 100% bad, but saying something means 50% of that. It's kind of subjective. It's not as bad as you think or it's not as bad as you would assume, right? So I, I think this is an insight that may have been cleared. All of you all along, but it's not something that is immediately clear to everyone. I think if we went out onto Broadway and we sort of had a focus group and we said, so if you're a seller and you have good news, should you share it? Of course people are gonna say yeah, you know, scream it from the rooftop rooftops try to get more bidders like. Get paid for that, right? Whereas if you then ask people so but let's say the news is bad, do you wanna disclose that? I think people's first impulse would be, do I have to? Is there a way I can try not to like this is this is not an uncommon reaction and what we should see is that in some circumstances it's a mistake because if people think you're hiding something they're going to assume it's terrible. And maybe it's not terrible, maybe it's just unfortunate, right? Maybe, maybe we don't want them to assume the worst because the actual facts are better than that. So to the extent that that is true, then due diligence feels like quite a cooperative exercise because the sophisticated seller is gonna say I need to share everything, good and bad, partly to get credibility as Jason said, and partly also because in terms of evaluation. The actual facts are going to be better than the dark imaginations that people can conjure up when you won't tell them what they ask you to tell them. OK, so this is, uh, one, assumption. It sort of underpins Ron Gilson's analysis. I'm about to tell you why I think the world is a bit more depressing than he suggests, but first, uh, please go ahead.

SPEAKER 4
Well, one bad, uh, uh, side effect doesn't rule out all the others. So even if you were to say, hey, it might potentially cause a rash, it could also potentially kill, you know, the entire universe and so on. So it doesn't necessarily why, why should the counterparty assume that you're not withholding something and why would they not assume the worst even if you admitted something? You could be admitting something and still withholding.

SPEAKER 0
Good question, Moshe. I think it depends on what we say the liability rule is. And so I, I think it's not too much of an oversimplification to say silence is protection. But once you speak, it has to be accurate. And so if it turns out, for example, that this drug has two potential side effects, one is a slight rash, and the second is it kills you and your entire family. I, I think leaving out the second and offering the first puts you in the lying zone rather than the not answering zone, um, but there's some nuance here and so your point is an excellent one, but let's, uh, consider. Whether there may be reason some assumptions there that um we haven't fully explored so that the dynamic isn't so simple uh ISAC can you help us please with uh let's see part. Uh, so part E, it says in principle, would your answer, sorry, that, uh, would your answer to D change if a seller is able to offer a justification for not sharing information which has nothing to do with the fact that this information might not be flattering.

SPEAKER 5
Yes, if, if the seller has some justification for why not to tell it, um, I think buyer cannot. Assume that it is hiding some bad news.

SPEAKER 0
Very good. So the whole premise of the analysis we just ran is that if you refuse to answer, people will assume the worst, right? If your refusal to answer means people will assume the worst, you have an incentive to answer so they know it's not as bad as they assume, right? But what if. They can no longer assume that the reason you aren't answering is because you're hiding something. Could there be another reason? And if there's another plausible reason why the seller will not answer your question, then it introduces doubt and you as the buyer will be thinking. Well, it could be the reason that they said, or it could be that they're hiding something and gosh, we don't quite know so continuing along those lines, let's turn to part F. Can you think of a reason why Carol might regret sharing clinical trials with Bayer even if the trials are glowingly positive if the deal doesn't go through? Hint, assume that Carol's company and buyer are competitors and that the trials contain valuable information. If so, does this offer Carol a strategy for refusing to disclose the information?

SPEAKER 5
Yes, um, because it's a buyer, uh, a competitor when the deal is not closed, um, Carol would not want to give some confidential information which is used to for buyer's strategy.

SPEAKER 0
Right, so let's say that Carol. Really doesn't wanna share these trials, but she knows that if she says I'm sorry I'm not gonna share that information, the buyer is gonna assume the worst she could try something else hey Carol, could we see the trials? She might say well wouldn't you love to see those in your position? I'd love to see them too and the buyer says, but I mean that's why we would buy you is the trials and then Carol says, yeah, I know, but I mean I don't know if you're gonna buy me and. I'm just thinking about these situations where someone thought they were selling the company, the deal didn't happen, and 6 months later their competitor is selling their drug or something really close to it, um, and, and they go out of business and how do I know that you're not gonna do that? I'm sorry, I'm sure you'd love to know all of the details of how we're poised for this tremendous medical and commercial success, but frankly that's what you're buying. And you cannot just get it without paying so with apologies, I simply can't accommodate that request. It's quite unreasonable, right? So, OK, so then. The buyer, uh. Doug, I think here, so Doug hears that and let's turn to part G. So if Carol has more than one reason not to disclose the trials, can buyer tell what the real reason is?

SPEAKER 5
Well, it's, it's quite hard to know for buyers.

SPEAKER 0
So that's our challenge is, is she hiding something or is she sincere and saying, yeah, no, I, I, this is proprietary and we just can't share it with you it's too valuable so that leaves so, so where are we? Well, one possibility is buyer just walks like well we can never know, right? And it's possible that this is an incredibly good deal, um, but it's possible that we would be completely cheated here. And we just can't figure it out because it could be that they're hiding something and it could be that they're not and so we're either gonna discount our price or we're gonna walk away and so on but are there things you can do? So what if anything can buyer do in response? Do you haven't thought about what they might try?

SPEAKER 5
Or buyer can request some information without confidentiality, uh, or A buyer can make an agreement that I would not use this information to compete with you.

SPEAKER 0
Good, so the buyer is likely to say. We totally understand, believe us, we're not trying to cheat you. We're actually very interested to buy your business, but I'm sure you can understand that we have shareholders and we have to be sure that we know enough about what we're buying so that we don't make. The kind of mistake that I'm sure you would never want to make in our position um so here's what we suggest uh we'll take a look at your trials but we'll sign an agreement saying we can never share this information with anyone and the team of people who reviews this can't share it internally and we'll commit that we won't pursue an idea like this for at least a year uh and so would that be would that be OK? so. And of course Carol comes back and she says I don't think so no uh we we simply can't get past this risk that you folks are gonna steal from us so with apologies, no I don't think we're gonna do that. So has uh has uh Doug learned anything by making this offer? What do you think? I'm sorry, I didn't get that. So we implemented the idea that you suggested, which is, hey, um, we'll enter into an agreement with you where we can't use this information um you can help us craft the contours of this, but that's what we'll do please show us the trials she says no. So has the buyer 11 version of this is we haven't made any progress right? because we still haven't seen the trials she's still saying no we're in the same place we were in and another version of this is oh well we actually learned something so could we have learned something from making this offer and she says no.

SPEAKER 5
Yeah, maybe. Buyer can think it's quite an excuse um yeah, quite an excuse to hide some bad news. So I think buyer can ask for a discount for the price.

SPEAKER 0
Good. So I, I think the point is, let's say you started with like it's 50% she's hiding something and it's 50% she's sincere and you offer a reasonable way to protect their interests in, in, you know, the proprietary information and she still says no. I'm not sure it's 50/50 anymore maybe we've now moved it to 65/35, uh, and then, um, Brian comes back and says, OK, I have another idea. You choose a scientist at a university, your choice, and that scientist who doesn't work for us will review the trials and answer the following question are there any potentially serious side effects here? And we won't see the compounds and we won't know how this drug is supposed to work. That's all we wanna know and you can choose the scientist and the scientist will be subject to a confidentiality agreement. And can never work for us for the next 5 years. So, um, if Carol then says, yeah, I'm sorry, this is exactly the way a company like mine gets taken advantage of and we're simply not gonna go along with this, but believe me this is an amazing drug you should buy it, but I'm not gonna get suckered into giving it away for free. So has this affected. Buyer's assessment, I think it would, right? Like now it doesn't look like it's even 6535 now it's more like 8515 she's hiding something. So, uh, again what's I think fascinating about transactions is there is this information imbalance. There is the potential for a transaction that's really good for both sides and there's also absolutely. Every reason in the world for each side not to trust the other, right? Because in principle Carol could be right that they're trying to steal, um, what they would otherwise buy and in principle the buyer could be right that she's hiding something, um, but I think the point is that lawyers can then suggest mechanisms that can try to promote trust and sometimes they work but even when they are rejected. The fact that someone is rejecting them is itself information, right? And so this is kind of the way parties can either converge on evaluation or figure out that they don't want to, uh, don't wanna go ahead questions comments. Yes.

SPEAKER 5
Can I ask a question about uh the asset deal and the stock deal? So in which situation will be the stock deal more preferred or more favorable for the buyer than the asset deal because we just talked about in some circumstance in some situation that the asset deal is more favorable to the buyer. Thank you.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, so situations where the seller corporation has favorable contracts and relationships, uh, if you buy the assets without the corporation you may lose some of that so I think that would be a reason, um, there are tax differences that I'm not gonna get into, but, um, but mostly I think from the buyer's perspective an asset deal is pretty good because you don't have to worry about the liabilities. William Uh, can I ask you then about part seven? Uh, Gilson says that parties have the incentive to be truthful in due diligence. Um, what does he mean by that? And do you agree?

SPEAKER 6
Well, I think he means by that sort of what we've just been already talking about, about the fact that the seller does have an incentive to be truthful in the information they provide and also in terms of due diligence, obviously the buyer has an incentive to make sure that they have as clear an understanding of what they're actually acquiring and who the party they're transacting with is. I do think. There is an issue that emerges with the seller on the seller's part where they don't actually have an incentive to share the most accurate information all the time if that information can't be verified with certainty by the buyer. That's where it becomes a problem.

SPEAKER 0
Very good. So, uh, I agree and I think the point is that on some assumptions, particularly the idea that nondisclosure is construed as bad news, there's pressure on the buyer to be accurate. So the buyer wants to share the good news but also the bad news to prove that it isn't worse and when you're in that world, it is a pretty cooperative process, but what I think causes this cooperative vision not to break down completely but to become maybe a bit more fragile is uh really the discussion. But intia and I were having where you can um try to confuse the issue and make it unclear as the seller whether you're hiding something or you have an independent legitimate reason not to share it which is why you know my. Amendment to what Professor Gilson said here is sellers don't necessarily have the incentive to be truthful, they have the incentive to seem truthful and they're not actually the same thing. Um, which brings me back to one of my favorite themes in this class. Please do be paranoid. Don't take things at face value in a transaction. Recognize that there may be strategic reasons why people invoke what sounds sensible, but maybe it isn't their real reason. Um, I have to admit, once you start thinking this way and you kind of look behind what everyone tells you all the time, um, the world can give you a headache. But nevertheless it really is the best way to proceed in transactions. I also will say just to avoid being misunderstood that I am in no way recommending that you try this seem to be truthful, don't be truthful approach because I actually think that in the long run. When you as a lawyer and when your clients as institutions develop a reputation for being a straight shooter, then transactions with you and with them become much easier, right? And then people won't feel like they have to push you at every opportunity to make sure that you're telling the truth and you may, I, I think not may, I think in the long run. You will find yourself getting better terms and easier negotiations because people trust you and there's an old saying that it takes a lifetime to build a reputation in 5 minutes to destroy it and I do think that if you sort of focus on the long term benefit of not just seeming truthful but actually being truthful, um, you get the kind of credibility that Zachary mentioned before. And I, I think things are better, but nevertheless, because you don't get to define the terms of how you negotiate with people and how they negotiate with you, a healthy dose of paranoia, paranoia is fairly essential here in my opinion. Um, OK, so another example to illustrate that, uh. So Joseph, Can you help us then with uh part eight? Let's say buyer wants to know, here, so if you could read that. Let's say buyer wants to know about any litigation pending for Carol's company. Carol can ask her lawyers who know the details of the litigation to write up a description, but the time they will spend will cost Carol 10K. Alternatively, Carol can invite buyer's lawyers to come and read the litigation files, which are quite large. If she does this, buyer is likely to have to pay their lawyers 50K. What should Carol do? Um, so I think Carol should probably provide the information to the buyer, um, and maybe assign them the cost, um, the $10,000 cost, because, um, the seller is the least cost provider as Gilson provides. Um, otherwise, any incremental, um, price above that $10,000 would probably come out of their sale proceeds. Very good. So this is Gilson's argument, and it has a lot of appeal to it, which is, you know what, if it's cheaper for one party to do something they should do it because in effect there's one budget for the deal and then there ought to be a price adjustment. So even though providing this information is something. The buyer wants the seller can spend the $10,000 because it's not $5000 and then the price ought to be adjusted. The seller should get $10,000 more to compensate them for doing this. So this is again a happy vision where everybody is acting in good faith and looking to promote efficiency. Um, on this issue I'm even more skeptical than I was before about Gil Gilson's idea partly because I think in a transaction that's large enough the due diligence costs don't really get renegotiated in the purchase price and it's, it's different people, it's kind of the CEO and some very senior people who set the price and then there's due diligence and then you can come back and say look there's this. Huge problem with the business that we didn't account for and therefore we need to renegotiate price and so on but it's not easy to come back and say look let's renegotiate that price because um their lawyers did it instead of our lawyers like I just I don't think that that's necessarily uh an easy thing to do so just right there. Um, each side is gonna maybe hope to get the other side to do things to minimize their own costs because there isn't necessarily going to be a price adjustment, but I also think there's, um. Something else going on here. Uh, Joseph, can you read part nine? Gilson says parties have the incentive to minimize the cost of disclosure. He says that a party that makes DD more expensive can be made to pay for this through an adjustment in the purchase price. Do you agree? Can you think of a reason why this might not happen? So I think I actually answered that one already, but I wanna, I wanna, um, offer you another fact pattern and this fact pattern is that Carol, uh, consistent with her somewhat unethical quality in the prior discussion. Um, knows that there is some pretty ugly litigation that is pending. And so, you know, one possibility is she says to her lawyers, write it up, explain to them what it is, we'll work it through into the price we can do this more efficiently we should do it, but what might an alternative strategy be on her part if she's more cynical, looking to get away with something. Um I mean, we discussed uh or disclosing the litigation and obfuscating the reasons why she can't um disclose the likely outcome. So her reason for this, for withholding the information, so there, there will be that, but she can say, look, we have a warehouse, it has all of our litigation files here's the key. Now there are about 10 million pieces of paper there we are looking to close in 3 weeks, but look at anything you want and if you have questions ask us, right? Um. As a legal matter. She's giving them access to everything. She can claim that she's done her job, she didn't hide anything. Oh, you didn't notice the file which has the billion dollar case in it. Gee, I'm sorry I assumed you would've looked at that first, right? Like, so there's that and then if you're the buyer and you've asked for like a summary of the material litigation, particularly something that might, you know, be particularly valuable, costly, I mean, and uh the other side says to you, well we can't really give you that here are the keys, look through the documents so Joseph does that um. Does that give you a lot of confidence when they say to you, we're not gonna tell you look for yourself? No, not at all. So we're back in this whole I'm not gonna tell you zone, but then can you think of, uh, what's the trick that makes that kind of answer plausible instead of the kiss of death for a transaction? What does Carol have to do in order to. Make things a little bit less clear to the potential buyer. Um, maybe you could, she could, uh, Say like, oh, there's not one clear answer. There's a lot of information that might be valuable to you in these docs. We're offering a reason. Not we're hiding something, but another reason why we're not actually able to provide you with that information and so, uh, just inviting the group, can anyone think of, so again you're, you're not you, but you're evil Carol looking to get away with something, um, what could she try to say in deflecting this request and handing them the keys? Yes.

SPEAKER 7
Um, one thing that came to mind would be. Something that was inspired from a previous question which is that maybe she doesn't have the resources at hand to provide the information maybe all the lawyers got fired or something.

SPEAKER 0
No, exactly like she can say well. I understand why you buyer are asking for that because you're big pharma with your own legal department so you're naturally assuming that we also have a big legal department but actually look if we were also big pharma. We wouldn't be selling this incredible drug to you because it's so valuable we would just develop it ourselves but we don't have the same kind of infrastructure that you have that's why you have this opportunity but it also means just remember like we do have a general counsel she's incredibly busy. We have lawyers, but like we we don't have your big army of fancy lawyer types we can't possibly do that but what I can offer you because we don't, you know, we look at whatever you want, here are the keys, but just understand that like we're not you, we can't do this. So again, you hear that you're on the buyer's side, you're thinking, huh? She can't even tell us the highlights of what's going on there. I don't know, but on the other hand, it's true they don't have the kind of staff. I recognize they're busy, they're jumping all over the place trying to get us information. Maybe it's accurate. Let's take a look. Uh, go ahead.

SPEAKER 8
Could you also say that you're not at liberty to share the information because of confidentiality reasons for the parties in the litigation? Could be might try that one too, right?

SPEAKER 0
These are privileged documents and we don't wanna blow privilege by sharing them with other people, um, so but again, the theme that I'm trying to establish here I think should be clear, um, refusal to disclose information. Can cause the other side to assume the worst, but knowing that you can try then to offer some unrelated benign reason why you're refusing to share the information and then it falls upon the other side to decide to figure out like, well, is that a pretext or is that real? Is this stonewalling or is it just incompetence or paranoia, right? And the in principle, these different. Explanations one could be true the other might not be true, certainly one is better for the buyer than the other in terms of whether they wanna buy um and again this is in my opinion, part of what makes these situations so interesting but you really do have to sort of. Look and listen, as they say, just to, to try not to miss anything because, again, there is such a thing as people just completely lying to you. That's not legal and hopefully you can sue them and recover damages later and document it, but what's much more subtle is when people are complying with the rules, not sharing things that they're not obligated to share, and you're trying to figure out why, uh, and so, uh, questions, comments. OK, so let's turn then to the role of third party experts. That's part 10, um. Xia Hui. Uh, Yes, can you help us please with uh this one which is um 10A. OK, uh. What, 3rd 3rd party expert.

SPEAKER 9
What role do accountants play in acquisitions? So they're the expert in finance shows situations of the company, so they do the due diligence that tells you what's going on with the financial status.

SPEAKER 0
Good. And so if we go back to our first day and we said part of what you can do is you can ask questions. And get answers. Another thing you can do is you can rely on third parties to do an assessment and so accountants are there to sort of evaluate the books. And what about investment bankers, the next one. And do you know what a fairness opinion is?

SPEAKER 9
So, they evaluate the business that like they estimate the company's value and give you an extra opinion on whether the deal's fair.

SPEAKER 0
Party come in and try to verify quality or question quality and all the rest. What about Part C? Do lawyers ever vouch for aspects of a deal?

SPEAKER 9
Well, yes, the liabilities of the deal, like, I mean, legal liabilities. Or the basically the evaluate the risk good and there

SPEAKER 0
may be a particular issue and they give you a legal opinion saying actually this is not a problem in an M&A deal, for example, maybe it's supposed to be structured to be a tax-free sale and you'll get a law firm that gives an opinion saying. We've looked at it. We think that it will be a tax-free sale, so you have, uh, different third party experts coming in to vouch for different aspects of the transaction, whether it's sort of the finances and the books and the internal controls and whether they are what you think or is the value right or are the uh legal risks properly dealt with, um, and the last one. When these experts are asked to reassure the parties on particular issues, why, if at all, might they be tempted to overstate their case? What, if anything, stops them from doing so?

SPEAKER 9
Well, it depends on who the expert is hired by, so each party's experts might want to overstate their uh in their own interest to make if the, for example, the seller might want to overvalue their company and then the buyer want to. Undervalued the company so they can benefit from it. And there's laws that regulate their behavior and make them liable for what they vouch for.

SPEAKER 0
On the one hand they have uh a natural inclination to try to give the sort of advice or assessment that the person paying them wants them to give right? And so if you're the seller and you've got accountants you'd really appreciate it if they said that your books were great rather than saying, you know, shoddy but acceptable right and so there's certainly an incentive to please your client. Um, but on the other hand, why can they still be depended on at least to a degree? Well, partly because of legal reasons and they can be charged with fraud and violating various rules, and I think there's also a reputational issue for them. If you think about why you want an accounting firm to sort of give you the stamp of approval, it's because people will take it seriously. Uh, in a way that they might not with an accounting firm that you've never heard of, but if the accounting firm is regularly known to puff and to say what they're paid to say rather than what's true, then all of a sudden the opinion from them is not worth as much, so there's sort of a short term, long term trade off for them. In the short term, of course they want to please the client that is offering to pay them to say something. But in the longer term if they go too far there will not be other clients in the future that will do this and so um it's it's actually interesting for those of you who end up working at law firms to understand better the internal process by which law firms sign off on opinions and. There are some where basically just any partner can give an opinion and the partnership trusts its partners and that's incredibly rare and what's more common is that you have people who aren't working on the matter and don't represent the client who need to be persuaded that the opinion is right because the thought is that they're a bit more objective about whether um the opinion can actually be given in the way that it's been drafted um and again sort of those different incentives at work. Questions, comments? Um, all right. Belinda, uh, can you help us please with the last one we'll do today. Ben Beyer owns a plot of land. He's considering buying a neighboring plot from Sue Cellar. Ben wants to combine the two plots and buy a skyscraper. He is concerned though that he will be able to get approved that he won't be able to get approval from the zoning board. If Ben can combine the plots, he's willing to pay 10 million. If he can't, he's willing to pay only 7. It's very likely that the zoning board will approve, uh, but the process takes time, so part A. Uh, yeah, yeah, I can. Right, so just wait, right? You have a contingency, you don't know what it's gonna be. It affects the price. Just wait and see if the zoning board will approve it, and then Part B. Uh-huh Exactly, basically the point is, what's it worth to you without the approvals? 7 million. That's our purchase price, but since it's worth an extra 3 when the approval comes in, then at that point if it happens you'll pay an additional 3, and I hope that this reminds you of our pool. Due diligence because it's the same point, uh, and again the theme of this class is the issues are the same, the context is different aspects of the solutions are the same as well. OK, so that's all we have time for today. Um, on today is Monday, right? So on Wednesday we will continue with, we'll just finish this and then we'll move on to the next discussion which is also M&A. Thanks everybody, see you then. 3 years. So if I'm a seller, I might be, so we just discussed that the, the, the main issue that we It's the buyer's ability to pay. Yeah, so if I'm the seller, I might be worried about the buyer's ability to pay because he hasn't paid his tax for like 3 years. So if now they're like more than 1 buyer, I might, I. Maybe just compare each buyer and just see who is the best buyer, but again, if they've got there's evidence that they can pay you, you can take the money, leave them with their tax problem, and that's their issue. So I think mostly it doesn't. But I hope you can see why it starts to matter with the contingent. Because then they may not be able to pay you in 3 years. Yes, I understand, but, uh, my concern is that if there's just one buyer, it's like, uh, and you also just. One time payment Get rid of this problem. Yeah, then it's fine. But what about like any other advice? I think the point is the buyer's problems are usually the buyer seller. That's the. Not true if the seller is getting final stock. Not true if there's a delay in payment, but otherwise it's generally true. OK, OK, thank you. like. I No. I
