So good to see all of you. I hope you had a good break. Welcome to DEALS. I'm David Shizzer, very glad to see all of you. I'm gonna say a few words about the overall goal of the class and then a couple of points about logistics, and then what we will do is we'll go through the discussion questions that I circulated. So it would be great if you would open those up because we're gonna turn to them in a minute or two. So I remember uh years ago before I went to law school thinking that I understood what happened in a trial but that I really had no idea what lawyers really did when it came to transactions and uh I don't think I'm alone. I think if you ask people who aren't lawyers what do you picture when you think about lawyers they're gonna say law and order or some. Uh, TV show that is about lawyers in the courtroom, but the reality is that the vast majority of people who graduate from this law school like me dread courtrooms and hope never to be in one, and certainly don't, you know, anchor our careers in the court, in the courtroom, although it's, it's terrific for those who do. So then the question is, you know, what, what is it that transaction lawyers do, and Some years ago there was a uh an emerging view among economists that the legal profession was kind of a source of social waste that you know they weren't producing the goods or services so it must have been a drain on the economy and then there was a kind of a counter movement a few years later where they had the stunning realization. That if you try to look at correlations between countries with well developed legal systems and rule of law on one hand and economic growth on the other hand tight tight correlation wealthier countries have effective legal systems less wealthy countries don't have effective legal systems sort of on average. And so then they were kind of puzzling like is there a causal connection here? Is it an accident? Is law just like a luxury good that countries buy when they're rich? Or does an effective legal system actually contribute to that prosperity? So I assure you it's the second. I assure you that legal systems do contribute to prosperity and the leading lawyers at law firms to work on transactions are actually helping the economy grow. They are not at all a drain on the economy. But my hope is that this class will give you a sense about why that's true and the basics inside of the class is no secret it is that there are a lot of good transactions out there and by good I mean transactions that can add value to both parties. But they're likely not to do them. Essentially because they don't trust each other and that lack of trust can cost these individuals and therefore society the value that could have been created if they found a way to get past those information and incentive problems and those information and incentive problems are everywhere and what the transaction lawyers do? Well, they're really good at identifying those problems in advance, seeing around corners to figure out where a deal may go off the rails. And they're also really good at thinking of different mechanisms to try to um help save the transaction and build the kind of information exchange and trust that's necessary for these things to happen and so one of the things that I think is true as lawyers develop over the years and mature professionally is you might start as a young lawyer they hand you a document and they say OK we're gonna do something a bit like this help implement it. And you look at the contract and you really don't necessarily know what the various provisions are supposed to do. My hope is that by taking this class you won't be in that position because usually these clauses are there to address very specific someone agrees with me, right? lending emphasis to my words. I appreciate it. Um, the point is, um, if you keep your eye on these problems and on the potential solutions to these problems, you will add value very quickly in transactions and sort of function as a more mature and senior lawyer. So that's the theory you'll decide for yourselves whether, uh, at the end of this class you feel like I've delivered on that promise. I hope that I do, but the way we're gonna do it is both to examine. These fundamental problems and transactions and to think about solutions and to do that in very different transactional settings. So there is something unusual about this class. It's not a class in this kind of transaction or this body of law. That's not the goal here. So there's no casebook, right? It's not about mastering the securities law or Delaware corporate law and takeovers or a particular part of the tax law. That's not what we're doing. What we're trying to do is we're trying to understand the basic realities, those economic realities which create the need for good lawyering. And then the kinds of solutions that effective lawyers can marshal in order to make these deals work when they otherwise might not have and so to do that we're gonna take a tour through venture capital we're gonna look at M&A we're gonna look at movie industry deals we're gonna look at nonprofits because by the way, the same problems arise there and some of the solutions are similar and some of them are different. Uh, we're gonna look at real estate we're gonna look at a whole range of issues, but the goal is never going to be. Please remember these 5 rules that govern a real estate transaction. That's not the point of the class. The point is, what's the economic challenge that could cause a deal like this to fail and how do the parties find ways to overcome that challenge? So that is the basic scope of what we're gonna be doing. Uh, in terms of logistics, there was really one thing I wanted to mention which is unnecessary for those of you who studied with me in other classes, but most of you haven't, and that is the way I like to teach. It is Socratic. I rarely, this is, you know, you will rarely hear this me speak this many consecutive words at once again this semester. This is not the way I do it. It's gonna be a conversation among all of us. And so, um, that means it's Socratic, which means there are panels, so you will, um, be primarily responsible for the material sort of one third of the classes, but in addition that material is mostly laid out in the discussion questions that I share with you. So basically as you do reading going forward, please do the reading with those discussion questions next to you. Because there will be things in the reading that I think are less important and we're not gonna talk about them. There are, you know, things in the reading that I think are very important and the questions will focus your attention on those. So that's really the function of these discussion questions is to help you hone in on the things that I think are important and then that's what we're gonna be talking about in class in terms of the panels. So this is on courseworks, but just to give you the heads up about it. So raise your hand if your last name begins with the letter A through J. Raise your hand. So you are panel one, A through J. Now please raise your hand if your last name begins letter K through R. Raise your hand for that, OK, panel 2. And then S through Z panel 3. OK, so, uh, today there is no panel. I'm just gonna be asking you to sort of participate without panels, but, uh, please don't stress about this. There's no pressure on, on any of it, um, but starting. Today is what today is. Wednesday starting Monday, starting Monday with um discussion questions number 2 that's panel 1. So panel one please just uh recognize that you'll be leading the conversation next time OK so uh in a minute I'd like to turn to discussion questions number 1 which will just drill down into the themes that I've already alluded to, uh, but before I do any questions, comments, anything about logistics? OK, great. All right, um. So, um, Michael, you have the misfortune of sitting close to me and I see you. So if you don't mind, um, we're gonna start, the two of us, this is the first question. And so the basic job for today for us is that you're looking to buy a used car and the good news is that I actually have a used car and I am looking to sell it to you. And turns out your budget is $5000 and it's great because I'm willing to sell for $5000 so I assume we are done, right? I assume that all I have to do is say to you, here's the car, $5000 you're ready to buy, right? Good, OK, definitely say no to that. Say no to that. What else would you like to know? A lot of information about the car accident history, mileage. Damage, uh, how it runs, repairs. Good, good. So basically there's, you know, this car could be worth $5000 it could be worth $15,000 it could be worth $5 at most, and basically you'd like to know more about what it's really worth because, um, just. From your perspective you don't know yet so I can be very helpful. All I have to do is simply say, Michael, it's a great car. You don't know me but trust me, this is a fantastic car so now we're ready, right? No, no, why are we not ready yet? What's holding you up? Answer the questions. Oh, but I did. I just, in the very abstract, I said fantastic, right? Trust me. And of course you do, right? Be careful how you answer this. No, you don't trust me. You shouldn't trust me, right? Do I have a self-interest in exaggerating the quality of the car? Yes, and particularly like, is it depending on the commercial setting, is it possible we will never see each other again, right? This could be just a one-off transaction. So I think the point is you are in the same situation that buyers are typically in. And so my question is. Which of us knows more about the car, you as the potential buyer, or do I know more as the seller? Sellers always know more, right? Because they own it already. So that is inherently an imbalance in information. And so Michael, one more thing for you, please define the term asymmetric information. Uh, it's when one party knows or has more information than the other party, right? It's when one party knows more than the other. What I hope you can see is that in a situation where one person is selling a used car to another person, there usually is a very significant degree of asymmetric information there. And what you should also see is that that's going to breed mistrust. Now it could actually be that I'm sincere and accurate in saying this is a terrific car. It could also be that I'm completely lying because I wanna unload something that has been a real problem and I'm hoping to extract as much money as I can for it and Michael's challenge is he cannot necessarily tell at least when we start talking about this transaction and what could easily happen is Michael might decide, you know, I am never gonna be confident there's just not enough that I can learn here to make me confident I'm done, right? And that may be exactly the right thing to do. But what I hope you can see is it might not be, right? It may actually be the case that the car is as good as I'm saying that it is. This is, uh, quintessentially a problem that comes up in transactions. Tell me your name, Nikki. Nikki. OK, great. So let's, um, let's take a look at Part B, if you don't mind. Um, no, I'm sorry, we did that one already. Uh, Part C. Do you, do you have access to this? OK, great. So could you read Part C for us? Um, in principle. Yeah Uh, in principle, could the problem of asymmetric information persuade a potential buyer not to buy a used car? Could this be true even if the used car is as good as the as the seller says it is? So what do you think? Yes to both, right? Yes to both is a review of what we were just saying, which then brings us to Part D. So you're the buyer now, you're taking over for Michael, you're thinking about buying the car, and would you be more comfortable if you can ask me questions about the car, but then what if I'm not honest in the way that I answer. Is there anything you can do to improve the odds that I'll be honest? So what do you think? Well, you can ask for evidence supporting what they're saying, like maybe for the car just have someone take a look at it and do a full inspection. Good, good. So third parties, so we're gonna come back to that in a second, but another thing you can do is you can ask me questions and, uh, let's say I say to you something like. Ask me anything you like in the next 3 minutes, and I promise I'll answer and then we're done. Make you feel good? No, not so much, right? And so what if you said, could you put that in writing, please? Would that maybe give you comfort if I was willing to do that? Yeah. And what if I said, I'm a handshake guy? I never put anything in writing. Does that make you feel good? No, no, not so much, right? But what we're seeing is there are things that you can do in exploring a transaction. Which can help you shed light on how much or how little to trust someone um, does anybody know like this process of asking questions and getting answers in writing? Lawyers have a term for that? Anybody wanna shout out the name for that? It's due diligence, right? And this is what young lawyers spend a lot of time doing and it's for a reason, right? It's because there's this asymmetric information in a transaction and sellers need to, um, share that information in order to get the buyer to trust them and to pay as much as the seller is hoping to get, uh, it's Addison, right? Addison, can you help us please with, so we've done part D. How about part E, and Nikki was alluding to this part. Uh, I mean, yes, I guess if a mechanic would look at the car, that would make me feel better because that's probably someone who knows more about the inner workings of a car than I do. And so this is another fundamental thing people do in due diligence is they bring in an expert third party and ask that person for an evaluation. And so Addison, part E, what if the mechanic is the seller's brother-in-law, my brother-in-law, um, that's fine, right? Uh, if it's the seller's brother-in-law, I'd feel less comfortable because then there's some careful, I'm gonna tell my brother-in-law what you're about to say. Unfortunately, um, I, I think that there might be incentive that you guys could be in cahoots to rip me off. So, uh, do you know the term agency cost? What does agency cost mean? An agency cost is the, is, I guess, the difference between that action that you would like done and what the person who actually does the action will do. Perfect. So the idea is there are situations when someone is supposed to be acting to advance their principal's interests, someone else's interests, and here. Potential buyer is hiring the mechanic saying, please do a careful, honest evaluation for me and tell me whether this car is good, bad, how much it's worth, and all the rest. So the mechanic is supposed to be doing that with an eye towards advancing the seller's interests, but if I'm sorry, the buyer's interest, I apologize if I I jumbled that, it's the buyer's agent, but if the buyer's agent is the seller's brother-in-law. And you have a problem, right, then the mechanic might be thinking this is a pretty bad car. But if I'm honest about this, then my spouse is gonna give me a hard time for the next year because, uh, my brother-in-law is gonna be really angry at me, so I better puff and say that it's really good, right? And, and whether or not that conflict actually leads to, um, this sort of misstatement, it's gonna undermine the credibility of what the agent does. So, um, we have information problems, right? This is what we started with there's asymmetric information the seller knows more than the buyer. We also have incentive problems because sometimes the solution that you want to use to overcome the information problem, sometimes it has its own incentive problem. The person who could verify this information can't be fully trusted because that person has a conflict. Questions, comments? All right, let's turn then. Um, so, uh, Elliott, uh, let's turn to. Part G. OK, so here's a possibility, uh, because I think Nikki is out, Michael's out, like they don't wanna buy this car, but it's possibly an opportunity for you. And what if I said to you the car is worth $5000 but I'm gonna, I'm gonna accept a $2000 payment for you now from you now, and then pay me $3000 in a year if the car is still running well. So is that potentially a solution to this information problem? Um, I think it could be a, a potential solution. Good. And part of the reason here is you can imagine Elliott thinking he wants 5000 for this car. It could be worth 5000, but it could be worth significantly less, and it's really difficult for me to know before I own it and drive it and see how it does. Now, if I, as the seller, understand that that's where Elliott is, I might say, you know what? What's the least that you'd be willing, you know, what, what would you pay if you think this car is really much, much worse than I said? And you might say, well, I guess I'd pay 2000 for it. And then I can say, yes, pay me, pay me that, right? And you are making an assumption that the car is not that good. But I'm going to disprove that assumption because you're gonna buy it, you're gonna run it, you're going to see that it's good, right? And so this is contingent purchase price, right? This is another mechanism that we observe in the world. Turns out we don't observe it as often as you might think, which is going to bring us back, Elliott, to the rest of this question. So, um, or in part H. In part G, does it matter how we define whether the car is running well? Um, yes, it does matter because the, you know, particular details of what it means to be running well could lead to like arguments later if I don't want to pay you $3000 later. I could always claim the car is not running well and if it's a vague, do they kind of disagree about money? That sounds so awful. I would never do that. You would never do that, right? But, but sadly that is a very common pattern which we as lawyers will encounter all the time. And so really, if you don't, so this is an ideal with possibilities that could easily go very badly if you don't think through how you define the conditions that trigger that additional payment. And part of it is just ambiguity. That's not running well. Of course that's what running well means. No, that's not what it means, right? And there could be honest disagreement, but, um, let's take this one step further. So Elliott, um, the difference between the car running well and the car not running well translates into how much money in our example? $3000. $3000 right? From the buyer's perspective, it costs the buyer $3000 for the, uh, if the car is deemed to be running well. So hypothetically, Would it be worth it to the buyer to inflict $1000 of damage on the car herself in order to prevent having to pay $3000? Yes, it could be, but no, no person would ever do such a thing, right? Yes, they would they would. So the point is this running well issue, it's really supposed to be about the quality of the car when it's purchased. It's not supposed to reflect also the level of maintenance and effort that the buyer, uh, adds to keep the car running well, but it's not necessarily easy to disentangle that. And there's actually a, uh, exactly the wrong incentive buried in there where the buyer is then gonna have an incentive to say this thing is terrible. I can't believe you saddled me with this. 2000 is more than I should have paid. Lord knows I shouldn't have to pay you another 3, etc. etc. And then of course the seller anticipating this problem, it may lead to a careful definition of what running well means, but in my experience, it also sometimes leads to the death of the contingent payment as a potential way to bridge, um. To bridge information problems, but the point that I need to make, I hope it's clear to all of you, is that there is sort of a blend of information asymmetry and incentive problems that can get in the way of a transaction. Uh, now that maybe shouldn't happen, but what I hope you're hypothesizing here also is maybe the car really is worth $5000. Maybe this is a transaction that would actually be good for everyone. But the parties aren't gonna get there, uh, or at least they're at risk of not getting there because of these challenges and, and arguably what they need is a lawyer who is good enough at bridging these problems that the parties can actually do this deal, OK, so, um, let's, uh, turn then to part J. uh, so Farhan, let's get you involved in this one. Uh, instead of a car, assume that I offer to sell you a house for $500,000. You need the house and the price again is within your budget. Um, is there any asymmetric information in this situation, as you, yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, it's the same scenario. You could have hidden water damages, you could have foundation issues and whatnot, and that's why we have disclosure forms and inspections.

SPEAKER 0
Right? But I take it that what would also work is if I, as the seller, just say to you. This house is awesome. You're fine. Enjoy it. It means nothing. Shake my hand. And did, did you just say it means nothing? Itde mean nothing. Oh, you're so, you're so right, and it's so cruel, but yes, right, we have the same, exactly the same dynamics, right? Exactly the same issue where again the seller knows more than the buyer. The seller has owned it, maybe even has lived there for a while, probably not necessarily, but, but they know the property much better than the potential buyer does, and the potential buyer knows that, right? And Farhan, the fact that I'm willing to sell for $500,000. Does that Trigger anything in your mind in terms of what you should be paying? Does it make you think you are, you're probably overstating

SPEAKER 1
the amount, right?

SPEAKER 0
Like if I'm willing to sell it for 500, then it seems unlikely that it's worth 700. And there's a real chance it's worth 300, right? Because people are likely to want, I mean, if it's so great, why would they be willing to trade it for $500,000 right? So, so the mere fact that someone is willing to sell is itself potentially a negative signal. And let's just talk about that for a minute more because that also exists, right? That's a problem in the world. Anytime you want to buy something, you should worry about it. So can you think of Uh, a reason why someone is selling a house that would really concern you and can you think of a reason that they might sell it that would. That you'd feel OK about any thoughts?

SPEAKER 1
I mean, if there's some foundation issues and they wanna, like, you know, just want to get rid of the house, sure, or if they've lost their job and they cannot afford a mortgage, that's not a reason I don't care about that as much, right, right.

SPEAKER 0
And if they've got a new job in another part of the world and they're moving, right, so sometimes you actually kind of want to know the background story behind the transaction because if, for example, someone says to you, I love the neighborhood. I just love the neighborhood and actually I'm gonna be your neighbor. I'm buying a house just down the street. Uh, yeah, no, no, it, it is actually the same size. Yeah, uh, but I, I just, I, I wanted to change. I wanted to change, run away, right? Like that's not a good story because they, they don't seem to want to change anything but the house itself, which suggests to you that there's probably an issue with the house. So on the other hand, if they say, I love this house, I'm heartbroken to leave it, but I got. Promoted in my job and I'm, I'm gonna spend a year and I'm at least 5 years in Taipei for the next 5 years. It just doesn't make sense for me to keep it, uh, you're getting a real deal and you know you might be right, but, um, the point is we would potentially want to know that. So going back to the mechanisms that we were talking about before, Farhan, is it a situation with a house where you'd want to ask questions and get answers in writing? Yeah, for sure, right? Due diligence with the house, definitely, um, is there a practice where you bring in a third party expert to look at it and you have inspectors. Inspections happens all the time. It's market practice. Are there ever situations where the purchase price is partially contingent? Yes, yes, right? So, um, the point that I mean to make with all of you is these information and incentive dynamics that we started with. The used car they're equally applicable with the purchase of a home, as are the potential responses that parties can use to try to test out whether the deal is worth doing and you know if it is to save the deal if not to um run swiftly for the hills and and avoid it. OK, um, Now, let's turn to part K. So is it Mingxin? It's great. Um, can you help? So P K, instead of a house, what if you want to buy a business? Uh, is there asymmetric information in this situation? Yes, of course, because the sellers would know how the business operates better than I do. Good. And are the steps that we talked about. Asking questions, due diligence, third parties checking things, um, you know, the contingent purchase price, do we see that sometimes in the sale of a business as well? Yeah, probably. We absolutely do, we absolutely do. Can you think of who a third party expert might be in the context of an M&A transaction? Um, I think probably bankers, um, McKinsey, right? Yeah, so, uh, let's start with something even more basic. So if you're buying something, is it relevant how much money the business is either earning or losing? Yes, and who can tell you that? Accountants, Accountants, right? So they give an opinion. This is a classic third party. It's, it's just like the mechanic coming to check the car, um. Are there ever potential conflicts with accounting firms? God, yes, right, uh, they're everybody's brother-in-law is the problem, right? Because there are very few accounting firms they work for companies, right? If, if the accounting firm is working for the seller, they're unlikely to say terrible things about the seller, right? So. There are potential conflicts embedded in these agency agreements, um, in these agency relationships. Investment bankers come in sometimes they'll give a so-called fairness opinion this price is appropriate. Do they get paid to do that? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, very large amounts, you know, millions of dollars to write one paragraph about how the price is fair, um, but there's no financial incentive that, yeah, OK, I'm not even gonna go there, um, the point is we have this blend of information and incentive problems for sure in the sale of a business. One other question about it, uh, Farhan and I were discussing this idea of you kind of wanna know why, why are they selling? Can you think of maybe a not so good fact pattern about why a company would be selling or a good fact pattern like what, what might the range look like? I think a uh bad fact pattern would probably be because the company is bleeding money from somewhere and uh I guess the seller is trying to jump ship before it sinks. Um, could also be, I don't know, a big pro product liability issue a lawsuit coming, um, and they want to. You know, be off, yeah, let's get out ahead of this and sell it before the market figures out how big our lurking liabilities are. Absolutely that's a possibility. It's also a possibility that the business just isn't doing well anymore. Uh, now those could be opportunities for a buyer as long as the buyer is fully informed and is pricing them, but they also could be reasons to think this is not for us, right? At the other end of the spectrum, are there reasons that occur to you, um, why. Seems like a good opportunity. Yeah, I understand why they're selling it has nothing to do with the quality of the business. Well, maybe the, uh, the previous owner wants capital to, to start a new business or maybe they, I don't know, they got sick, they want to spend more time with family, um, just wants to get out personal reasons. And, and particularly that last part what people call succession is a, it's actually a TV show. And I did not mean to give it a plug, but it is a good show. I like it, um, but the point is, many times, uh, there's, there's a, a founder who's been running a business for decades, and she loves the business, but she's getting to an age where it just doesn't make sense for her to run it anymore and maybe, maybe she doesn't have children, maybe she has children, but they have neither the interest nor frankly the aptitude to run it. Succession again, uh, and so the point is. She has to sell it, not because the business looks less promising than it used to, but because she's just not the person to run it anymore and they need to turn it over, right? And that kind of opportunity can be very appealing to a buyer because the fundamental business is very promising and there's nothing suspicious or troubling about the circumstance, but then they're, you know. Then there's the situation where the founder knows that the business is on the brink of failure, uh, and they're going to present it as a succession type issue when it really isn't at all and so, um. Perhaps if for those of you who decide this class is not for you and you're not here next time, just remember this one point be suspicious, OK? Like don't believe anything the first time you hear it you kinda have to check things because in a commercial setting people have incentives to say what they say and you have to try to read between the lines recognizing that it's illegal to lie to you like they can't do that but if you sort of ask the question. And you marvel at how beautifully they didn't answer it, that could be a signal that something is going on now it's an invitation for you to ask a more direct question to try to really find out if they're deliberately avoiding the answer or they just didn't realize they didn't. Answer it, but in any event, um, part of why I like this kind of practice is that there's a lot of strategy and a lot of thought that goes into it, uh, you may find that you like it for the same reasons, um, but in any event I think it is fairly inherent, uh, in this kind of practice, um. So Luis, um, say it again. Louis, Louis, thank you. So Louis, um. Where were we? Uh, yes, Part L, Part L. Do you agree with the following statement? Because the seller always knows more than the buyer, I should never buy anything ever again. Exactly right. So this is a misapplication of what we've been talking about because I am definitely saying be suspicious, but we can't live in a world where we never do a transaction. That would not be a satisfying situation. Uh, so now, Louis, uh, do you agree with the following statement? Although transactions vary in their details, every transaction involves problems of information and incentives that can discourage parties from entering into what would otherwise be value maximizing arrangements. Yes, so that is, that is one of the key features of this class. And now Louis part N, do you agree with the following statement? A central responsibility of transactional lawyers is to help overcome information and incentive problems. They do so with a range of contractual and organizational responses such as due diligence, contingent purchase price, stage financing, and vouching by third parties. Yes, right, so that is the basic point of this class, and we're going to be exploring that issue in different settings for the next few weeks. Louis, thank you. All right, any questions or comments? So let's, let's turn then to another fact pattern. And so Anna, uh, can you help with this one, part two? So stores that sell clothes online often allow people to return them at no charge, but it costs them time and money to let people return them. Have you ever bought clothes online? Yeah, of course I have too. We all do. Um, so part A, why give people a money back guarantee of this sort? What's the purpose of that? Yeah, I think it incentivize buying and puts the store like, um, in a more, um, like good position with the customers and bringing more customers. Good, so now I'm confused because if um. You know, there, there's the item on the website and if it says on the website, this is a good shirt, then I'm fine, right? Like I should trust that and just buy it, shouldn't I? Uh, no, no, no, say no, no, no, clearly no, right? And so the point is, how can they build trust with a potential buyer who's thinking, well, that's what it looks like on the website, but I have no idea what it really looks like in person, right? How do they build trust? Well, they build trust with, um, the money back guarantee. If you don't like it, just return it, right? If you don't like it, just return it. So I think a key explanation for this practice, which we're all familiar with, is as a solution to asymmetric information. Because the seller knows more than the buyer about quality among other things and so the um the buyer needs to be reassured now Anna, does this issue come up in the same way if we go to the store, try on the shirt there, and then pay for it and take it home? Do we have the same uncertainty about what we're buying if we go to the store and we hold it in our hand? No, no, right? So they have a competitive disadvantage because consumers have other options, right? And so you can't let people try it on. On the Internet you have to send it to them so they can try it on and so again I think this really is um an effort to overcome information asymmetry, a kind of a significant form of information asymmetry and of course the point is we can't let you try it on, but we can sell it more, you know, at a lower price because we don't have the same overhead. So if you want to capitalize on this potential savings, please do, but we'll help you by giving you this money back guarantee, OK, uh, so Sabrina. Let's turn to the next one. Congratulations, you're the head of a clothing company and so your colleagues come to you and they say, so we sell these clothes online, if someone who buys them spills wine on them, should we take them back? Um, I would say generally not return policies usually exclude damage that's caused by the buyer, um, accepting any item that's already damaged would create a moral hazard where they're less incentivized to take care of it and then the policy would become like unsustainably expensive. Good, good. All of that is true, and I'm going to come back to the moral hazard point in a minute because it's 100% right, but let's also remember what Anna and I were discussing before. What did we say was, if not the reason, then at least a reason to let people get their money back? What was the reason? Uh, to build trust in the product, right, so that the potential buyer can test the quality of what they're buying and be reassured that it's worth buying this because they can always send it back. So if that's our goal, do we need to let them spill wine on it to test its quality? No, no, right, it's beyond the scope of what, um, of, of the purpose of this contractual term. So it's true, as you properly observed, that it is usually not the case that they let you do that. But I hope you can see that it makes perfect sense that they don't let you do that if in fact the purpose of the money back guarantee is to address information asymmetry which I tend to think probably is a purpose now you've anticipated this, but let's go to Sabrina to the next part um one of your bright and ambitious colleagues comes to you and say and says you know I've got an idea. Let's let people. Um, spill wine on it and still return it. We'll have a better return policy which basically says return it for any reason. We, we'll, we'll take it back. It's not a problem. It's just that you have to pay an extra amount. If you pay an extra amount you can return it for any reason, uh, and so then they say to you, and here's how we're gonna price it we have found that, um. When we didn't allow returns for stains, about 1 in 10 items would get stained. So we think that what we need to do is we need to charge an extra 10% to cover those 1 in 10 scenarios. And if we do that, then we should cover the costs of offering this warranty, and we can distinguish ourselves from our competitors. So what do you think? Um, because moral hazard increases the risk and people know that they can return stained clothes, they'll be less careful and the stain rate is most likely to increase beyond the baseline of 10%. So to be sustainable, the policy would have to charge more than that. Yes, yes, so this is a terrible idea, right? And it's a terrible idea because of the mistake that you properly pointed out, the fact that 1 in 10 items of clothing were stained before under a system where you couldn't return them. Doesn't tell you what that percentage is gonna be as soon as you say to people, you stain it, we'll take it back, right? It is likely that they will be less careful, and when someone else bears your risk. You take more risk and Sabrina you use the technical economics term for that. What is the term for that? Uh, moral hazard moral hazard, right, moral hazard basically means if someone else is bearing your risk, you will take more risk. I don't know how many of you have life insurance. You're kind of young in your lives to have it, though some of you might have it, but I remember the first time I got life insurance, I, being a compulsive person, read the policy and I noticed that I had to swear that I wasn't going to do any skydiving. So that's a moral hazard point, right? Like as soon as you insure my life I'm gonna take risks. Um, anybody watch the TV show Seinfeld? You ever seen it? OK, I love this show. I will try to minimize the references I make to it, but this one is sort of tempting. There's an episode where the main character is trying to rent a car and so he's made a reservation. He goes to the desk and the, uh, the people say, oh, Mr. Seinfeld, we have your reservation, but we don't have a car for you. And he's not too pleased and he says, what do you mean you, you know how to take the reservation but you don't know how to hold the reservation like what kind of situation is this? and so he sort of makes a lot of clever jokes about that strange situation that many of us have been in and then uh finally Mr. Seinfeld, we have a car for you, um, and then he says, definitely give me the insurance because I'm gonna dent the hell out of this car. Moral hazard, right? Like he's got the insurance. Once he's got the insurance, he is happy to inflict as much damage as he can because the car company is gonna pick it up. OK, questions, comments. OK. Um, Min. So, can I ask you about part 3? So you wanna go into the business of organizing outdoor concerts, but there's a challenge which is that sometimes it rains and so the concert has to be canceled. So is this an issue of asymmetric information or should we be thinking about this as a matter of uncertainty and what is the difference? It's a, it's an issue of uncertainty because no one knows the weather and then the difference is that asymmetrical information is when one party knows more than the other, whereas, uh, exogenous uncertainty is when no one really knows. I can predict what might happen. Exactly right, exactly right. So the term asymmetric information means one party knows more than the other party. So in the situation where I offered Michael the opportunity to buy my fabulous new car, old car, used car, and he decided not to, I know more about the car than the buyer does, right? But with the weather, nobody knows, right? Nobody knows what the weather is going to be, you know, 6 months from now. We, we, we can't know. And so the term uncertainty is used to describe an issue where nobody has superior information and there is risk associated with it. OK, so now let's turn to Part B. So if a concert is canceled because of rain, who should bear the risk? And let's say there are 3 different potential parties here. One is the performer, person who's going to be singing. A second is the ticket holders, meaning they paid for it, the concert doesn't take place, they bear the risk, right? You bought the ticket, sorry it didn't happen. The the loss is on you. And then the third possibility is the arena owner, the owner of the arena. So this is an opportunity for us to make predictions about who it should be, but more fundamentally to try to think about how you would decide something like this. How, how would, how would you make the argument to a counterparty and more fundamentally what solution is the market likely to give you in that situation? So do you have an initial thought about who ought to bear this risk? I believe that the organizer or the owner of the arena should be the one who bear the risk. Good. And so, uh, the arena organizer, uh, tell us why. Why do you think that? Oh, because the owner of the arena or the organizer is the party who is best known to predict the risk and also to insure against it. Good. Now insure against it we could add another party called an insurance company, but let's assume that there's no insurance and that parties will self insure, meaning they will bear the risk themselves uh but the first thing I'll say is that I, I agree with your methodology. And I think what we should be looking for here is what party can bear this risk at least cost. What party can bear this risk at least cost? Because if the risk is sort of going to someone else, then it would be rational for the person who could do it more cheaply to say, hey, hey, I'll take that off your hands, pay me. Right? And so it really ought to be that the answer converges on whichever of these three parties has the best ability to absorb this risk. So why did you think, why not the performer? Any thoughts? Or maybe the more fair question is why did you why did you think of the owner or organizer? Oh, because I can always reschedule the event. So, um, they can always reschedule. Good. Anybody else have a thought about this? Farhan.

SPEAKER 1
Is it possible that the organizers have been holding many events and one loss in one event and we have benefits and you have profits and other ones, they can cancel each other out, but the performer may not be performing multiple times as many times as they're holding events or the ticket holder, just one show I'm going to. I'm not going to a show every, every week.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, no, I, I think that's right. I think that's right. So basically we're looking for the person who might be most diversified. And performers could be pretty diversified in the sense that they might sing pretty much every night, but they might sing indoors, they might sing outdoors, and so maybe if you make them bear this risk, they're gonna be less likely to be willing to sing outdoors and so on. The owner of the arena has no choice. I guess they could put up a roof, but putting that aside, they're sort of stuck with this, um, but, uh, there's another aspect of this. Yeah, go ahead.

SPEAKER 2
I wonder if there's a moral angle we should consider, um, particularly from er the perspective of unjust enrichment because the performer didn't provide his or her services and the venue owner didn't provide the venue, so I think maybe there should be a splitting of the cost between them, but the, the payer or the the the ticket holder um didn't didn't provide any service that, um, you know, there's unjust enrichment in that regard.

SPEAKER 0
So I think that that intuition is a is a nice 11 of the challenges with it is I think each party could make that argument, right? So the ticket holder will say I paid but I didn't get anything. The singer can say I gave up a night. I made myself available. It's not my fault that it rained. Why should I bear that cost and the arena owner could say I held the night for this event and you know I, I sacrificed could have been somebody else I did you know I did this and I didn't, I didn't get paid so it kind of brings us back to the question of who is best positioned to bear the risk of loss. I think the answer does very much have to do with diversification yeah go ahead. Can the arena owner like reflect a change in the ticket price, raise the ticket price by maybe 20%, um, and that's the easiest for them that way, you know, the ticket holders are buying a higher value ticket, but that way they don't have to bear the risk, um, if the concert's canceled because the owner took on that risk by charging a higher price. So I think that's, that's very much the answer is we're gonna see this priced into the terms where I mean you could say to people, look, you're gonna pay less for this, but if it rains it's your problem, or you can pay more and you know we'll bear the risk for you and I think the market tends to converge and uh pay more and give me the makeup concert, the rain date, and so on but here's the question. Does the arena owner know with any confidence whether it's gonna rain on a particular day? No, no, not at all. That's very uncertain. No one can know that. But is there something they do know maybe about the frequency of rain? Yes, they can like maybe make like an expected value calculation or something. I think they can. And so say more about that. Uh, do you think the probability of rain in Seattle. Is the same as the probability of rain in Morocco. No, I think Seattle would be higher. Uh, definitely higher. And, um, are we guessing or do we know? We probably have some historical data that we can look at and maybe there's like a 50% chance of rain in Seattle on a day in April. And so we, you know, charge a higher premium than we would for a concert in July in Morocco. Good and um more generally, let's imagine I'm just making this up, let's imagine that it rains 1/3 of the time in a particular place. um, does it work to increase the ticket price by 13 and then to give people refunds on the rain days? I think that would make sense to do. From the owner's perspective, they've protected themselves. Do they need to know which days it's gonna rain? No, not in theoretically, no. They don't, right? They just need to know approximately how many rain days there will be in a year, price the tickets accordingly. And then they're basically diversifying and they're the right insurer, whereas this only works for someone who's buying tickets if they literally go every day, right? If, if you go every night to an outdoor concert, you could make the same calculation, but most people don't and that's why I think the owner of the arena is uniquely positioned. To do this because they can just diversify in that way and they protect themselves, does that make sense? But really the ultimate point that I mean to suggest here today is when we negotiate about how to allocate a risk we should be thinking about potential differences among the parties and about who can do something at lower cost. As opposed to higher cost, because if you ask someone for something that they can do more easily than you. They're probably pretty motivated to do it if you'll compensate them, and it will be worth it to you to compensate them because they can do it more cheaply than you, so the compensation that you offer is cheaper than the cost you would bear doing it yourself. So part of this process. We've, I started in a kind of a contentious place like nobody believes anybody else and that's true, but there's also, there are also opportunities for synergies here and cooperation as people try to figure out well who's in the best position to do this, let's have you do that and we'll adjust the terms and so on. OK, questions, comments. OK, good, um. Let's see. Alexander. Where are we? I think we are now, yeah, we're now in part 4. So you're considering buying stock in either Autoco or Carco. They make similar products, automobiles, and are otherwise similar except for this difference. The executives in Autoco all own stock in Autoco, but the executives in Carco don't own any stock. Why might this difference be significant?

SPEAKER 3
Um, I think Uh, in a sense, like executives are agents of stock, uh, share, shareholders, so, um, given the fact that the executives in Autoco own all the stock in the company, they would be more likely to have the interests of the overall company. Um, in mind and it kind of gets at like the agency, uh, problem.

SPEAKER 0
Exactly. So there's a concern with companies that the people who run them don't focus on the interests of the owners, they focus too much on the interests themselves, and so one standard potential solution is make them part owners and they'll think more about the owner's perspective. So in that spirit, Amy, let's turn to part five. So you're the CEO of Bigo, publicly traded firm. You're thinking about buying a corporate jet. The business of the company does not require it, but you think I'm the boss. I deserve it. The jet costs the company $10 million and you will derive satisfaction from that worth about $100,000 or 1%. So part A, will, shareholders want you to buy the jet. Uh, if not, how much influence do public shareholders have over this sort of issue and who else might be in a position to stop you?

SPEAKER 4
Well, first of all, I think the shareholders definitely won't want, uh, myself, so the CEO to buy the jet because it brings in no value to the company. Um, but I believe they have very little influence to the public to this sort of issue. Um, but I do think the board or potentially like the other decision makers like the CFO and the finance team could have a say in this to stop it.

SPEAKER 0
Exactly, right? So the point is this is not an efficient thing to do. We're spending $10 million to give someone basically $100,000 of what's really compensation. And you'd be better off paying your CEO $100,0001 and not spending the $10 million on the jet. So, uh, as you say, this is not a pro shareholder choice, um, but the reality is that public shareholders have very little voice in companies. Directors have much more. So if the directors focus on this. They can basically say no to the CEO, sell the jet come on, you don't need that, uh, and if you don't sell the jet we will sell you, right? You'll be you'll be out. So, uh, the, the board is the right place to try to exert that kind of discipline, but of course they don't always, um, so Maria. If you are not a shareholder, is it beneficial to you as the CEO personally to buy the jet, um, and what is this type of incentive problem called? Well, uh, if you are a traveler. It is personally personally beneficial for you because you are gaining a direct benefit of buying a private jet. um, in respect to this, you will be enjoying $100 million in benefits, uh, and this would translate into an agency problem seeing that it's a direct translation of, uh, the firm bearing the cost of $10 million. So yes, it would be beneficial only for you as a CEO and that would be an agency cost problem. Perfect. So from the CEO's perspective. Effective this is completely rational. The $10 million cost is on somebody else. The $100,000 benefit goes to her. So sure, do it, and this is a classic agency cost, right? A decision maker thinking about her own interests, not about, uh, her principal's interests, the owners of the company. Maria, alright, so Part C, if the CEO owns 2% of the company's outstanding stock, is it beneficial to the CEO personally to buy the jet? know. That you'd be a shareholder. Wouldn't be necessarily beneficial personally to you. Now bearing some of the risk of buying the jet, so now you're trying to align yourself. Well, some of the interests of the other show. some of Exactly. So, um, 2% of, uh, $10 million is $200,000. So now she's bearing $200,000 of the cost as a 2% shareholder. It's only a $100,000 benefit to her. All of a sudden the calculation changes. The CEO doesn't want this anymore. So can equity compensation be a response to agency costs? Yes, right. So this is the theory of it. And I realized this is kind of a stylized example, but this is the theory behind it, uh, Rachel. All right, so part six, you are the CEO of Bigo, whose stock price is currently $100 per share. You've worked there for your entire career. You're well respected in the business world for your successes. As a result, you constantly receive other offers to work elsewhere, something you appreciate, but you've turned them down. So now the story begins. Part A. One of your senior managers brings you the following proposal. If you invest all of Bigco's assets in a new technology, the venture, it could pay off very well. Specifically, there's a 50% chance that the company's stock price will be worth $500. Per share. On the other hand, if venture does not succeed, the company will become bankrupt, so the stock price will be worth zero. If you proceed with venture, what would your stock price be worth to risk neutral investors? Right? Perfect. Good. So just the simple expected value calculation is there are two states of the world. There's a 50% chance that this is worth nothing, 50% of zero is zero, right? And then there's a 50% chance that this is worth 500. 50% of 500 is 250. So you expected, the expected value of your stock price is 250. Um, what did we say the value of the stock price is now? It's 100. So would a risk neutral shareholder say do it or don't do it? Right, so a risk neutral shareholder would say this is a good deal. Go ahead, pull the trigger, do this deal now. Part of the reason the risk neutral shareholder would do this is because the risk neutral shareholder presumably is diversified and so if you have 200 of these bets, it is very rational to try to, you know, have them all do this and you will lose on some but you win on more and you will make money. So from a risk neutral perspective this is something that should happen. Um, Part B. If the company enters bankruptcy, what would your shareholders lose? Not a trick question. What was the share price? 100, so they'll lose, they'll lose the $100 value of their shares, um, and if they're mutual funds or individuals with diversified portfolios so that this represents a small percentage of their holdings, um, are they OK to do this? Yes, right? Like that was the point I was just making, but now if the company enters bankruptcy, what does the CEO lose? So maybe the CEO has equity, maybe not. Let's assume not. What does, what happens to our CEO who is getting all these job offers? They're losing their job? Yes, probably yes. Is it gonna be just as easy to get another job? something. Right, I, there's a kind of a reputational issue with, oh, didn't you preside over that terrible bankruptcy? Yeah, thanks for your interest, we'll get back to you, right? Like this is not a great thing for her reputation. So, uh, do you think the CEO is likely to be more enthusiastic or less enthusiastic about making this investment? the Right, um, they're not diversified in the same way that shareholders are diversified, so therefore the CEO is gonna be more risk averse than the shareholders will be and that is a, uh, pretty typical pattern that we often see so Rachel, is that an agency cost? It is, it is because really it's the owners and their interests that are supposed to determine corporate decisions and if a CEO is sort of thinking the shareholders may want this because they can, but from my perspective personally this is not good so I'm gonna stand in the way and I'm not gonna let it happen. It's also an agency cost. It's making a decision, prioritizing yourself over the interests of your principal, that's the owners, right? This is a more sympathetic case than the wasteful purchase of a plane, but I put the two together because they're kind of the same problem in a way. It's the same sort of issue. And so, um, Pauline. Let's take a look at Part D. Assume that the CEO has been receiving a $3 million cash salary every year, but the compensation package has changed to $2.5 million in cash and 100,000 shares of Bigco stock currently worth a million dollars. If Bigco proceeds with venture, how much would the stock be worth if the, if the investment succeeds? I think 500,000 to 50%. So I think, um, 100 per share becomes 250 per share. So 1 million becomes, I think 2.5 million. So there's a nice upside for the CEO now in doing this. Um, if it fails, what happens to the stock? It becomes 0. It becomes, it becomes 0. So under this new package, will the risky investment seem more or less attractive to the CEO? It's definitely more attractive to the CEO. I mean, it may not be attractive enough, right? It may not be attractive enough, but it may be more attractive. And then when we start reshaping it so that there's sort of stock options which give you a lot of upside, maybe the size is bigger, it starts to explain. Why CEO pay packages sometimes seem so large, it's partly in order to incentivize them to be willing to take risks. And you know what, if this is a career-ending thing for you, don't worry about it because. You will have made a lot of money anyway, right? Like there's that aspect of it, and there's an interesting set of questions that are beyond our scope for today about how much is too much and so on, but the fundamental point here is there are agency costs that are much more benign than just I can't believe you waste money on that plane, um, that have to do with the level of risk and. Again, pay packages are the, you know, a, a key element of how you try to align incentives of management with, uh, shareholders. So in that spirit, let's turn to the next, um, Marissa. So part 7. Assume that the stock of company is currently trading at $45. Assume also that the S&P 500 stock index is, uh, trading at, no, the, these numbers are, are wrong, sorry, uh, the stock of the company is supposed to be $60 I believe. And the S&P 500 is supposed to be $6000 which isn't quite right either, but round numbers, uh, so assume that the company grants executive 100,000 options to buy the company's stock at $60 at any time in the next 10 years. And let's assume that 10 years later the company's stock prices increased by just over 10% from 60 to 66. How much does the executive earn from these options? $600,000. Yeah, so $6 a share, 100,000 options, $600,000 of return on these options. Now let's assume that 10 years later, the S&P 500 has increased by 50% to $9000. How happy do you think the shareholders are with the company's performance? If they're still taking $600,000 and uh the market did that much better, probably not that happy. Yeah, not so happy, right? Like a 10% return in our company when the S&P 500 appreciated by 50% is pretty disappointing, right? It's pretty disappointing. So, um. Should the shareholders feel good about the fact that the CEO was rewarded by this option package? Why might they not be so happy? Um, I think just it should have done better. Yeah, you know, sure, I mean, the stock price went up, but it went up so much less than everybody else. Like, why are we paying you for this? You, you could have basically taken our assets, put them in the S&P 500, and done better for us than whatever decisions you were making, we shouldn't be paying you for that is a critical perspective. Now, let's, uh, assume. That, um Changing the assumption, now assume that 10 years later the company's stock price is still $60. How much does the executive earn from the options? Um price hasn't moved. Is it worth anything to be able to pay $60 for something that's worth $60? No, right? That's just the current price. So the options don't offer any return. So with a flat stock price, you get nothing. And then Part D, assume that 10 years later. When the company's price has not moved, it stayed at 60. The S&P 500 has declined by 50% and is now $3000. So in that situation, do you think the shareholders are happy with the CEO and the company's performance? I think so in that situation. It's a really good accomplishment. Wow, you managed to keep our stock price steady while the rest of the market lost half its value. So, um, now part, do you think the options given to executive are, um. Structured in the right way to create the incentive shareholders want executives to have, are there any problems you'd like to fix? Um I don't know that It's structured in the right way. I feel like it's not incentivizing performance from the executives. Right? Basically we have overpaid in a situation where the price went up, but much less in the market, and we have dramatically undercompensated the CEO. In a situation where the stock price was constant and the market as a whole collapsed by 50%, so this is a conventional structure used with stock options. This is sort of the standard approach, but it does have this potential problem, um, so Dong Jay. Let's take a look at part eight, our grand finale of the day. So like in the above question, assume the stock of the company is currently trading at 60. Assume also that the S&P 500 stock index is trading at 6000 all the same. But here's the change. Instead of granting an executive 100,000 options to buy at 60, so-called conventional option, the company is going to offer a so-called indexed option. And under an indexed auction, executives have the right to buy company stock at any time in the next 10 years, not for a fixed price, you know, not for 60, but for a floating price for the value of 1% of the S&P 500 on the date of the use of the option. So 1% of 6000 is 60. So today. The price would be 60, but the price on your option is going to change with the performance of the S&P 500. So now part A, assume that 10 years later, company stock prices increased by 10% to 66 and the S&P 500 is increased by 50% to 9000. How much money, if any, would the executive make in exercising the 100,000 options, and does this result seem appropriate?

SPEAKER 5
Um, he wouldn't be making any money, I believe the option price would be $90 now, so he's not incentivized to exercise it. Correct.

SPEAKER 0
So this is, uh, uh, an exercise price on the option that changes with the S&P 500. And if the S&P 500 is up by 50% from 60, you know, 6000 to $9000 now the option goes from 600,000 to 90. And would you pay $90 for something that's worth $66 in the market? No, you wouldn't. And so therefore this option is not going to generate any value in this situation. And is that appropriate here? Is that the right answer from the perspective of incentives and rewarding people for good performance?

SPEAKER 5
Um, I think there's a disalignment between the agency and the principal.

SPEAKER 0
So, um, I'll answer my own question since I think I wasn't clear enough about it. Um, we were critical of the idea that someone gets paid for going from 60 to 66 when the market as a whole went from 60 to 90%. That seems like a windfall that you didn't deserve. We fixed that here, right? There is an absolute increase in the price, but the increase is less relatively. The relative increase is less than in the index. And so therefore, um, no payment and that I think is appropriate, right? And now, uh, one more. Assume that 10 years later, the company's stock price is still $60 and the S&P 500 has declined by 50% to $3000. How much money, if any, would the executive make in exercising the $100,000 options? And does this result seem appropriate?

SPEAKER 5
He would essentially double his money because he could buy something that's worth 60 $60 per share with $30 per share, right?

So now you pay $30 for a stock that's still worth $60. That's a $30 per share profit, $3 million for 100,000 shares. Uh, so you are rewarding. A situation where the stock price is constant and the market as a whole declines a lot and does that seem like the right answer? Yeah. Yes, right, so a so-called indexed option can address the challenges that we described in the earlier parts by basically measuring not absolute increases, but how did you do compared with the index and if you outperform the index, you get paid. And if you underperform the index, you don't get paid, OK, um, Audrey. So last question, if you served on the board of directors and were named the chair of the compensation committee, would you favor granting the first type, the conventional options or the indexed options? I think I would generally favor the indexed options, um, because they reward a firm specific out performance, um, rather than the board market movements. Good. So there is, in my opinion, and that's why I wrote these questions the way I did, there is, I think, a pretty good argument for using indexed options instead of conventional options, but they're almost never used. They're almost never used so it's a little bit of a puzzle which I will leave to all of you to think about but I will tell you that for some years I was the director of a company. I served on the compensation committee and I said how about indexed options and people were very uninterested in doing this and so um I will share a reason that I think is a pretty valid reason in the case of that company but it's not generally applicable so with an indexed option. You need a baseline, right? What's the index gonna be now I think the S&P 500 isn't a bad index, but it's not that well calibrated because people work in a particular industry, so maybe a better result would be let's do an industry benchmark if you are um a software company, let's give you an index of software companies and let's see how you do compared to. Your sector, the problem with the company that I served on is we were sort of uh uh an unusual mix of different industries and there weren't really comparables that anybody thought would tell them very much about how we were doing um so you know maybe there was a valid reason in our case not to do it although I still think we should have done it. I'm bitter which is why I wanted to tell all of you today. But uh the basic point is there are mechanisms that we try to use in response to some of the incentive problems that we've been talking about, um, but they in turn can be complicated and either more or less effective. Part of what lawyers do is to try to figure out the best structure that can achieve the goal. So that's our introductory discussion for today. Um, absolutely all of what we've said today will be repeated another time, so if you didn't find that you followed everything, it's not a problem. Um, this was really meant to be that coming attraction in the movie and we start the movie, uh, we start the movie on what day is. Today is Wednesday on Monday. So on Monday, um, there is a second theme in the class which is about regulatory arbitrage, right? What value do lawyers add in a transaction? Well, one form of value, and it's the major theme, is there are these incentive and information problems and you have to figure out how to solve them. But the other theme is that it is invariably the case that legal systems are imperfect in the way they categorize and so you'll find yourself in a situation where two fairly similar things that you try to do are treated differently. And when that's true, and it is true across the board in every jurisdiction and in lots of bodies of law, when that's true, another source of value that lawyers add is steering clients in the more favorable category, and there won't necessarily be a consistent answer. About what that favorable category is, um, but, um, that's the minor theme in the class and my favorite case study will not surprise you it's the uh federal tax law as an occasional example of this so we will be uh talking about some examples. Over the course of the semester and what we'll do on Monday is just a kind of a basic look at tax planning as an example of regulatory arbitross so that's our job for um Monday and then on Wednesday we'll dig into a specific transactional area. Thanks everybody. I look forward to seeing you on Monday. Have a good weekend. I'll be here. I'm here. I will. OK, perfect. I Like. Yeah. You
