F. Hey everyone, good to see you all. So Let's get started. So I think it's um worth my emphasizing. That, um, I think it's worth emphasizing that from my perspective the class really begins with the next unit and what I mean by that is that the first two, discussion questions are really meant to be sort of introductory, um, anticipating themes that we're gonna cover in the rest of the semester. And I say this because I, I realized that with some of these concepts we go a bit quickly, maybe more quickly than we will going forward, and the reason is just that my method is this is meant to be kind of a coming attraction in a way. These are things that we're gonna cover throughout the semester you'll see these themes again. So therefore I wouldn't worry too much if you're finding that you didn't quite catch every detail. I think my hope is that starting with discussion questions number 3 and real estate, um, that we will, uh, maybe. Be sure that everybody is, is sort of with us in every detail. Um, but with that in mind, what I'd like to do is just to review what we talked about last time so that we can then finish that discussion, move on to the next, but I wanna be sure that, uh, everybody is sort of clear on it. And I think there were really 4 points that we've covered so far, and the first is the one that's really important and it's general, and that is the idea that transactional lawyers can add value when you have a situation where you can do 2 things that are economically very similar, but the regulatory treatment is quite different. And this is not unusual where you have two paths which lead to a similar economic outcome, but the treatment is different, uh, and certainly in US tax law, which is the main case study that I use in this class, that happens a lot and you might say but it shouldn't happen and I would agree with you and it might happen because of administrability compromises or because of political dynamics that make it difficult or unappealing for members of Congress to broaden. A rule and it can also happen because it's hard for the people who write the rules to anticipate all the things that people might do um but for whatever reason it just reflects the limits of administrability prediction and politics uh and it happens all the time that similar situations are treated differently and when that happens a transactional adviser who knows the difference and can maneuver you to the more favorable treatment. Can add a lot of value, so that's point. Number one. Point number 2 is that in the context of tax law there's that general point economically similar things being treated differently is that that general point plays out in at least 4 different ways and so I gave you 4 different examples of how this can happen which really are sort of 4 different types of tax planning. I don't think it's really critical that you. Remember them as 4 different types and so on. It's more that we're gonna see examples of these throughout the semester, but I'll just review what we said. So the first example is really um. Some combination of an exclusion or evaluation and the idea is there's value that is clearly there as an economic matter but the tax law doesn't treat it as taxable value and so that would be the case where instead of getting salary you get a gift. Money is money. I have $10 in my pocket, whether it was from my salary or from a gift. I can spend it either way. But the tax law will treat the salary as something it will tax, and it'll treat gifts as something it generally doesn't tax. So we then saw the situation where someone clever says, you know what? Why don't you stop paying me a salary that's not high, cut my salary, give me a gift instead. I won't pay tax. And so that would be a form of inconsistency. Money either way economically similar taxed differently so um that's an exclusion and exclusion means there's value that you're getting but the tax system doesn't recognize it as something that it's going to tax you could also do this. Not so much by excluding the whole thing but by playing games with the value of something and we're gonna be looking at that more in a couple of weeks. So there's a second type of planning which is economically similar money is coming to me, but can I classify it as one type of taxable income instead of another so it's going to be taxable. It's not an exclusion, but instead of it not being taxable at all, I could maybe maneuver it into a more favorable category of income and in the US there's so called ordinary income like for your salary taxed at a higher rate there's capital gain that's generally gonna be a certain kind of investment return that's taxed at a lower rate and so you'd like to treat something as capital gain instead of as ordinary income and so we saw. That that's a goal as well. And so what we also saw is that sometimes an employer will get what looks like an investment and how is that taxed? Is it taxed a salary or is it taxed as investment return? And so I just gave you a preview of something that we're going to look at in more detail in a few weeks, and that's this idea of an election you can make to say I'll pay tax on it as ordinary income now, it's value now, but anything that happens after, if it goes up, that's capital gain to me. That's the so-called 83B election, really a coming attraction for our discussion of tax and venture capital coming in about two weeks or so. OK, so we looked at this idea of exclusion. We looked at conversion, which is trying to turn one type of disfavored income into another type of income. But again, like these categories are examples. The basic point is the simple one economically similar things treated differently. The third example is deferral. Yes, I still have to pay tax on this, but fortunately I don't have to pay tax on it now. I can pay tax on it out into the future and by delaying my tax bill I reduce its burden on me and the way to think about that is if you're able to take the same amount of tax but pay it in the future instead of today, it's kind of like you're borrowing money from the government. If you'd paid the tax now it would be their money. The ability to pay it in the future instead of now is kind of like borrowing money from the government. I hope you can see that and the government's not charging you any interest, so tax deferral is like an interest free loan from the government. Interest free loans are valuable. They're hard to get. People don't usually do that. And so the fact that you can keep the money and not pay interest basically reduces the burden for you. And there's a concept known as present value. Some of you have no doubt seen it before. Some of you no doubt have not seen it before. And basically what present value is about is, hey, I owe someone $1000 but I don't have to pay it. If I had to pay it now, it would cost me a full $1000. But if instead I don't have to pay it now. And the interest rate is like 5% or 5% after taxes or whatever um instead of setting aside $1000 to cover this, I only have to set aside $950 because my $950 that I set aside now will grow to $1000 in a year. And so I'll, I'll I'll pay the $1000 in a year, but the present burden on me, the present value of that, the amount that I have to set aside now to cover it later. is less than $1000. How much less depends on the amount of time we have and the interest rate, but it's less. And so the present value is less than $1000. And in my example, if it's 5% after tax interest rate in one year, it's going to be about $950 as the present value of $1000. In one year that's another way of saying it's less, which is another way of saying if I can delay my tax paying later instead of paying now that's economically similar but the tax treatment is better, right? So that's another example is deferral. We said exclusion, we said conversion, we said deferral, and then the last one that we talked about was shifting. And here. Something is happening. Tax is gonna be paid on it. It's gonna be the same rate. It's gonna be ordinary income capital gain like whatever it is. We're not changing the character of it. We're not changing the timing of it. What we're, what are we changing? We're changing who the taxpayer is. Changing who the taxpayer is, maybe the mother has a higher tax rate than her son, so finding a way for the son to be the person who's taxed on the income instead of the mother is is another way of um getting a better result with an economically similar situation. It's economically similar because the same family is getting the money, but it's treated differently for tax purposes, so that would be another example I gave you. Um, another one, not just the family but also multinationals, that was really just for those of you who are interested because it's kind of a hot topic, a contemporary topic. But I'm not really teaching it in a way that you need to follow those nuances, but the basic idea is you could have a parent company that's a US company you could have subsidiaries in different parts of the world and different jurisdictions charge different taxes, right? Different tax rates in different places so in the same way. That you'd like the lower taxed son instead of the higher taxed mother to get paid. You'd like the lower taxed Irish subsidiary instead of the higher taxed US parent company to earn the income and pay a lower rate of tax, and we talked a bit about that goal and about how it is potentially achieved, but that's, you know, that's not critical. So what did we say? We basically said again, simple point, economically similar. But taxed differently, that's a way in which transactional lawyers add value, which is different from our major theme in the class, which is about overcoming information and incentive problems and then we looked at different examples of that and we classified them, but there were two other points that we also emphasized and one is that um although. The regulatory treatment may be different, and although they're similar. They're not the same. And sometimes the non-tax differences are important and we call those non-tax differences frictions that's the name that's often used for them for that but the basic idea is I might have a way to reduce my tax bill. But I have to do something else that I don't wanna do and in fact I really don't wanna do it and I'd rather pay extra tax in order to avoid doing it so simple example. I can earn money in December. I can earn money in January. Money is money, and yet by earning it in January I can push my tax bill out a whole year and so that would normally be a very appealing to do appealing thing to do. But on the other hand, what if it's December and I really need the money and if I don't get the money I have to take out a loan at very high interest in order to cover my expenses? Well, if that's the case, then I might give up on. Paying my tax later, which has value to me because the price of getting that benefit is the high interest loan and that's just more expensive than the taxes that I would save. Which is why when you do this kind of analysis you don't just think about tax, you also think about non-tax costs and sometimes the non-tax costs are high enough that you don't proceed with the tax plan. I said that one way to understand this is that we're looking not to minimize taxes, the lowest tax bill under all circumstances, we're looking to do as well as we can after taxes, right, maximize our return after we pay our tax. Well, that after tax return reflects not just the taxes you pay. And also these frictions that you might or might not have to deal with and so sometimes it's better to pay a higher tax in order to get lower other costs that would maximize your after tax return even if it doesn't minimize your taxes. Right, OK, and then the last point that we were making, and this is where we were, we were just reviewing it, is this idea of looking at all the parties to the transaction. So you can't do a deal with yourself usually. Instead you've got one or more counterparties. And it could be that a particular variation of how you might do it could be good for you, could reduce your tax. But if at the same time the very same variation increases someone else's tax, then it becomes more complicated because in fact if your tax savings is not larger than and it's the same as or even smaller than the extra tax that your counterparty has to pay, then this is not gonna work. Because your counterparty is gonna say no, that's gonna cost, you know, you're saving $1 in tax, but I'm spending an extra $1 in tax. The only way I would do this is if you pay me $1 and then you think, wait, but if I pay you $1 what's the point? Because I've just given away my entire tax savings, never mind, right? The way it could still work is if the tax cost to the other side is smaller. Than the tax benefit to you, hey, I can save $2 in taxes. I know it's gonna cost you an extra $1. Let's adjust the terms so that I pay you $1 and then we're sharing it, and that could work, right? But the point is you have to think about all the parties to the transaction. If you don't, uh, this isn't gonna work because they're gonna figure it out and they're gonna say no and so you've gotta figure out what can work and what won't work. Um, so, uh, in a second we're gonna finish discussion questions number 2 at part 9, which is all parties, which is just a review of that last point, but first questions, comments about anything so far. Yes, please go ahead. Um, right, so there are different types of taxes. This is all extra credit, you know, it's not a class on tax, let alone on, on gift taxes, but I'm, I'm happy to answer the, the question which is, uh, so we have income taxes, we have estate taxes, we have gift taxes, and so the idea is if, um. I give you a gift. It will not be income to you. There's no income tax on it. And then in certain circumstances, if I make a gift to you, I might have to pay tax to the government, but it's only very, very large gifts. So you can give many, many $1000. You can. I think it's like um $16,000 worth of gifts to someone without any issue at all. And then if you're giving more than that, you can file a form just to keep track, but you can give a total of about 16. 15 or $16 million worth of gifts in your life without ever paying any gift tax on it and just a little background, so um about just a couple of years after the income tax was enacted, Congress reinforced it by passing this is not quite accurate, we had an estate tax, we repealed it, but Congress started with an estate tax which meant that when I die, um. My um my estate will pay some tax before it goes to my heirs, but as often happens with the tax law, Congress missed something that taxpayers did not miss, which was if you gave it away before you died, you avoided the tax, so you had a lot of people becoming incredibly generous on their deathbeds. And this went on for about a year when Congress figured it out and then they added a gift tax which is really just meant as a backstop for the estate tax, but the estate tax only applies to very large gifts. A married couple can leave $31 million to their heirs without any consequence at all. And so the same rule applies. You can give that much in gifts, um, so it's not the case that like um. For anyone who is worried that, you know, they, someone had taken them to dinner and maybe now they have to report that on some tax return, no, no, no tax for gifts usually. So thanks for the question. Anything else? OK, so let's finish then. Um, this is. Uh, that's all parties discussion, and we're still looking to panel one. Um, Max, is Max here? Hi, so, um. All parties As review, remember that when analyzing tax planning, uh, whether tax planning is effective, we have to consider all parties to the transaction. Could you read part A for us, please?

SPEAKER 1
Yes, um, recall the example of Fran, the independent contractor. For tax reasons, she cares when she receives the payment. What about George, who is the one making this payment? Assume that he is also a cash method taxpayer and that the payment is a business expense that he can deduct. Does he have a preference about timing? Is it the same as Fran's preference? So I was thinking that he might want to deduct this year and also next year because otherwise he's giving up a year of deductions on the payments.

SPEAKER 0
Right, so he's gonna say, wait, it's good for you to wait. You don't pay tax this year, but it's bad for me to wait because I don't get my deduction, which means I'm paying tax on some things that I wouldn't have had to pay tax on because we're waiting. So, so no, I wanna, I wanna pay you now. Um, OK, Nadia. Uh, so now we turn to Part B. If Fran and George are in the same tax bracket, they pay the same tax rate, what tax advantage, if any, is there for them to adjust the timing of the payment? Um, I thought there was no impact, no benefit, no benefit, absolutely, because basically she defers her tax, you know, let's say it's, it's $100 an invoice. 30% tax rate she can delay $30 of her taxes for next year but he loses a deduction of $100 that means that uh instead of avoiding paying a 30% tax on $100. He pays a 30% tax on some other $100 so his $30 of tax gets accelerated into this year because hers gets deferred into next year. There's no net advantage to the two of them. Hope you guys can see that, um, OK. Ralph. Uh, is Rob here? Oh, OK, no problem. Um, Shahad, can you help with this then? Thank you. So, um, What if Fran is doing this work for a nonprofit like a university? Does that change the analysis?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, I was thinking that it would change the analysis because basically the nonprofit does not pay income tax, so they have no preference.

SPEAKER 0
Precisely so the idea is now all of a sudden. The analysis we just did, it doesn't hold anymore because they don't have the same tax rate and the nonprofit's tax rate is 0%. So if she says to George, who now works for a nonprofit, hey, if it's OK with you, I'd like to wait until January before you pay me, that'll delay my tax, he'll say, Sure, no problem, doesn't matter to us, we can't use a deduction one way or the other. There's no deduction, OK. So then have you heard the phrase of the phrase tax accommodation party or tax indifferent party? So that is an exam so the nonprofit is an example of that. This is a kind of entity or person who is subject to either no tax or different tax rules. And therefore is perfectly comfortable accommodating your tax planning because lowering your tax bill won't necessarily increase their tax bill and a nonprofit is the easiest example. A non-US person is another possible example if the tax rules that apply to them are different from the tax rules that apply to you. And then a third example which is more subtle is even within. The US tax system there are different tax rules that apply to different people so insurance companies securities dealers, they're actually subject to different rules and so a lot of times they can let you structure it the way you want because it doesn't affect them. OK, so that brings us to the end of our introductory material. We started with an introduction to this idea of information and incentive problems and fixing them, and I'd say that's 80% of the class. But even in the discussion we're about to have, there will be some regulatory arbitrage that comes up, as you know, from, from having looked at it, so we'll be looking at that too. But now, let's turn to residential real property is our first. Transactional setting, uh, and again just to remind you, the method of this course is that we have these general themes and we're then gonna be playing them out, exploring them, figuring out how they work in different settings. So today, very simple, you wanna buy a house, um, Wednesday it's about buying a business, then we talk about venture capital, eventually nonprofits, movie industry, and so on. And part of what I hope you will see is that the actual issues turn out to be surprisingly similar and the solutions are similar and it's useful to be able to spot those issues and to know what to do to resolve them. All right, so let's turn to our discussion of Bob Beyer, and this is panel 2. So, uh, Sheila. Aye. So, um, I know it's long, but actually the facts here are a bit important. So do you think you can read this long discussion of Bob Beyer for us and then we'll answer the questions.

SPEAKER 2
Oh, OK. Um, Bob buyer wants to buy a weekend house. You are Bob's lawyer. He sees a property that he really likes in Pretty County which is 50 miles away from his year-round home. Susan Seller's asking price is $1.1 million. Bob offers $950,000 and they settle on a price of $1,030,000. Susan is represented by Linda Lawyer. Before signing a contract, Bob needs your help with due diligence on the house, which was built in 1957. An important issue is that most houses built then were heated by oil and had oil tanks buried underground. In newer houses, oil tanks are no longer buried underground because of concerns about contaminating soil and groundwater. Buyers looking at older houses sometimes hire experts who use metal detectors to look for underground tanks. This inspection costs approximately $1000. If a tank is found, the market practice is for sellers to bear the expense of removing it, which costs about $5000 but can be significantly more if the tank has leaked and the soil needs to be remediated. Good.

SPEAKER 0
And so Sheila, I'm going to interrupt you for just a minute. Which is to say that I know that in law school we're generally training you in a certain style of thinking which includes reading cases distilling the general principle applying those principles to other situations but I also wanna emphasize that great lawyers are good at that but. They're also good at other skills which you've had long before you came to law school including what for lack of a better term we might call non um common sense and maybe an antenna for when people are not quite telling you the truth. And I, I cannot say strongly enough how valuable that skill is in a transactional practice and so the rest of this, these facts are meant to try to give you the opportunity to use that skill as we look at the facts. So thanks Sheila, please continue. OK.

SPEAKER 2
In the property disclosure form which sellers provide to anyone looking at the house, Susan answered no to the question, is there an underground oil tank? Before signing a contract to buy the house, Bob hires Ira Inspector to look for potential defects in it. In his inspection report, Ira observes that the oil tank currently is in the garage, but he sees pipes going from the garage into the ground, which is a sign that there could be an old oil tank there. I'm pretty sure there was an underground tank, Ira tells Bob. Otherwise, what are those pipes for? Bob relays this question to Susan, who answers, there aren't any pipes. When Bob sends a picture, Susan answers, I don't know, but maybe those pipes lead to a propane tank. We use propane to heat the pool. Ira says that this doesn't make sense since the pool is quite a distance from the garage.

SPEAKER 0
OK, so I'm going to stop you now. Has she been consistent in her answers so far?

SPEAKER 2
She wasn't consistent with her answers, I think.

SPEAKER 0
Good. Can you give us an example of an inconsistency?

SPEAKER 2
Um, first, she in the disclosure form, she answered no to the question, is there an underground oil tank? And then, um. And then when Bob sent. A picture. Susan answers that I don't know, but maybe those pipes lead to a propane tank. So at first she was saying no, but then she was saying, I don't know which is so and a

SPEAKER 0
propane tank isn't an oil tank. So in a way you can read this is consistent, but you skipped my favorite part of this. Um, hey, what are those pipes and what is her answer?

SPEAKER 2
And she says there aren't any pipes.

SPEAKER 0
There are no pipes. Who are you going to believe, your eyes or me? Right? And so this is not great, right? And so then because she denies that there are pipes, you send her a picture. So now she's pivoting. Oh, those little pipes. Yeah, no, I don't know, uh, something else. It's the propane tank. OK, please continue.

SPEAKER 2
Susan follows up with another email. Spoke to the oil company that has supplied oil to the house since I bought it. They reused the tank that was there and relocated to existing location. Neither I nor they have any knowledge of an underground tank. Further, during construction, we excavated around the entire house and found none. Bob wonders where the tank was before it was moved. Was it underground so that it might have contaminants in the soil? Through his broker, Bob asks Susan whether the tank was relocated that was relocated used to be underground. Susan replies, When we bought the house in 1992, the oil tank was in the original garage and was about above ground. When we expanded the house, we knocked down the garage and built the new one and relocated the tank to where it is today.

SPEAKER 0
OK, so I'm gonna stop you for a second. Now, I think um there's a way in which almost everything that she said is sort of consistent with the idea that there's no oil tank and there's never been one. Um, but. As it sort of plays out, do these multiple answers strike you as adding to her credibility or eroding her credibility or neither? And then I'll ask others. Um, I think that she, it, it's eroding her credibility

SPEAKER 2
because she refers to many different stories and many different stories just to come to a conclusion on whether there was a tank or not and whether it was underground or not. So for simple questions, she was giving very complicated answers.

SPEAKER 0
Others. Yes, please.

SPEAKER 1
I mean, she didn't really even answer his question when he first asked, um, where was the tank before it was moved like she answered where it was, I guess when she bought the house, but odds are that she probably or hopefully she would have asked these exact same questions. Was there a tank underground when she purchased the house and she doesn't really answer that question.

SPEAKER 0
Good, good. uh, yes, please. I would also say like, even if we took her at face value that like what she's saying is true or like different parts of it are true, it just seems like she doesn't know what she's talking about and so it's like, OK, if she messed up on this, what else could she have messed up on generally? I like it. And by the way, so one theory is she doesn't know and what would the other theory be? Um, she's like lying. Yes, that would be the other theory, and you were actually, uh, very good to point out that neither of those is desirable because, you know, not knowing means that whatever assurance you might provide is not very persuasive, but of course knowing and trying to mislead you. Not very good either. And so, uh, Sheila, going back to the good point that you started with multiple stories, right? And it's all to prove the same thesis, right? There never, never has been and is not now an underground tank like she's, she's been consistent. On that, but the stories about how she knows and where it was and how this all played out, the fact that they change really should be a red flag for any lawyer and this does happen, right? Like you, you could sort of say to yourself, how is it that we could ever know if people are lying to us and sometimes unfortunately people are so good at it that it's difficult she's not so good at it. Because she really is, you know, one story, it answers the question and we're done like that's what you'd expect and instead the fact that it's not playing out that way is, uh, is concerning. So now if you continue please.

SPEAKER 2
Bob asks Susan whether she would put a representation in the contract, saying that there is no oil tank, and if one is later found, she will pay to clean up any environmental damage. Susan says that all she would say in the contract is, to the best of my knowledge, there is no underground tank, and that this representation would not survive the closing. This means that if one is found after closing, she is not responsible for any harm it might have caused.

SPEAKER 0
Very good. OK, now we turn to part A.

SPEAKER 2
Based on these questions, do you think Bob should conduct a scan for an old underground oil tank? So I think definitely yes, given the way that Susan answered the questions, the inconsistencies, and the Many stories he should definitely see for himself if there is an underground tank. Very good.

SPEAKER 0
So what we have is we have inconsistent accounts of what happened. That's a bad sign. There's also something we haven't talked about, so. Was she willing to give a flat assurance that there never was a tank?

SPEAKER 2
Um, no, she used a very lawyerly response to the best of my knowledge, which means that she might, which shows that she can be hiding something.

SPEAKER 0
Very good. So to the best of my knowledge is a qualifier, uh, I mean, at some level everything that we say is to the best of our knowledge. I think that I'm here with all of you. I've seen the Matrix it's possible that you know I've been plugged in and this is all computer generated and not actually happening so does that justify to the best of my knowledge? No, right? But there's another thing so how um what's the lifespan of the contractual assurance that she's offering?

SPEAKER 2
She said that the representation would not survive. The closing, so the lifespan of a representation is very short, right?

SPEAKER 0
You know, once you buy it, forget what I said, you can't use it anymore, um, so that inspires a lot of confidence, right?

SPEAKER 2
The opposite of that, yeah, the opposite, exactly right, so

SPEAKER 0
because if she really believed it. Why is she so hesitant to to say it in writing? Further evidence that either, as we said, she doesn't know or she's lying. These are all possible, OK, which takes us to part B, uh, Pedro. Uh, could you help us please with Part B, do you think?

SPEAKER 3
Um, do you think it is reasonable for Bob to ask Susan to bear some of the cost of the scan? As Bob's lawyer, please offer arguments explaining why Susan should share in the cost. Uh, I think she should bear at least some of the costs for to investigate because she's the one that has the property. I think it makes sense from my standpoint.

SPEAKER 0
Good. So, um, and you and I can develop this more in a minute, and I think that was an excellent initial answer. Uh, just keep in mind that in a negotiation what you always wanna say is, but I want you to, I want you to bear this cost I don't wanna pay, right? And that's not a persuasive argument. Uh, and indeed it can work in the sense that people might know they have to accommodate you because you've got bargaining power, but this is the first time I'm going to make a point that you're going to hear from me a lot. Bargaining power is never the answer because you can use your bargaining power in a lot of ways. And so if Bob thinks she should do this and you know she's willing because Bob's the only buyer and she doesn't believe she'll get anybody else, Bob can also say, you know that price you mentioned? I'll pay 80%. I'm not paying more, right? Like that's another way to use your bargaining power. You can use your bargaining power in lots of ways. So when you negotiate a particular deal point. The bargaining power is always there in the background and the parties also kind of understand that there's a bargaining power bank and it's finite and you can get only so much on either side so what you're looking for are other reasons why it would be appropriate for one party as opposed to another party to do something. And so Pedro, you made a good point. You started with the idea this is your property and so I think inherent in that, and this is the point you're making is you kind of have a responsibility to know what's happening on your property. It doesn't sound like you do and therefore you should figure it out and tell me in a way that's credible, which is get the inspection, spend $1000 and then come back to me because otherwise, frankly, I don't quite believe you. So um I think that's part of it, but Pedro imagine that Susan the lawyer comes back and you're representing Bob so Susan the lawyer comes back and says yeah she's already told you. She doesn't think there's a tank, um, she signed the form saying there's no tank she's told you what she knows and she's convinced, so there's just not really uh a chance that she's willing to do this. She thinks you're wasting money. So then the question is, How do you come back to her and so can you think of a a kind of a. Secondary position that you could take to get, to get some money from her, uh, maybe in some situations, and maybe something that would be hard for her to say no to. Any thoughts about your follow-up?

SPEAKER 3
I would ask for representation, but better than what she offered, I would say that there is no oil tank or something in that way.

SPEAKER 0
Great, so hey, you're telling me you're so sure. That we don't need to do this and you're not willing to spend the money. Fine, let's put that in writing and if in 10 years I've got environmental damage, I want to be able to come after you, etc. Good. So that's certainly something, and I predict that she will not want to do that. We already know she doesn't want to do that, but good idea. What else? Anybody? What else can we do? Because I think there's another position, yeah, go ahead. Engage an inspect, engage someone to verify whether there is actually a tank, uh, underground or not and ask the seller to share half of the cost or a certain percentage of the cost. Excellent. OK, so listen, I know you think that you know, but it just seems to me that you don't, and I'm perfectly happy to share this cost with you. Why don't you pay 50% and I pay 50%, um, but let's say she's stubborn. And she says, look, you're just wasting our time and I think it's gonna be your money, buyer, because I have no interest in paying for this because there's no tank. So then there's another follow up, which we haven't covered yet. Yeah, go ahead. Um, he could just pay for the inspection but then require that she pay for the cleanup because if the, so let's say she's gonna pay for the cleanup anyway, because that's market practice, but I like where you're going. That's, that's, you know, pretty much exactly where I was going, but with something slightly different. Yeah, I was just thinking that like he's already spending like a million dollars on this house and this is only costing him $1000. And compared to potential litigation risk if like some envi the government comes and they or they have to pay damages for the the I don't exactly know what the downstream cost would be but worth it to pay it but we still want her to cover it if we can get her to do it, uh, so yeah, go ahead. Maybe they can reach an arrangement where he will offer to pay it, but if they find a tank, then she has to reimburse him. Right, this is, this is the other thing that I think we can do, which is really kind of where you were going anyway, so excellent. And what I love about that personally. Is it is so difficult for them to say no to that, right? Because the initial answer that they're giving is there's no tank. I'm certain there's no tank you're wasting time you're wasting money let's move on and then you say OK I hear you I'll pay for it, but you're obviously very certain that there's no tank so I take it you won't object to reimbursing me if we find one because you already know there isn't one. Uh, well, uh, right, like how do they, how do they say no to that? So I think at a minimum you get that, uh, maybe you can do better and split it 50/50 upfront or, you know, maybe you're sure enough there's a tank that you'd rather do it the way I just described, uh, in any event, OK, so good, we have covered part B. Let's turn to part C, but first, any questions or comments? OK, great. Uh, Ryan. Uh, is Ryan here? Yes, thank you. So part C, assume that Bob does a scan and finds an oil tank, and Susan agrees to remove it. How might this interaction affect Bob's dealings with Susan on other issues? Um, This might make it so that. Um, Bob has a higher level of trust with Susan, um. Since she. Now let's, let's agree to remove it once. Um, did she say there was a tank? Um, she said there was not. She said there was not. Did she say it once or multiple times? Uh, I think multiple times, multiple times, uh, and yet we just found that there is one, right? Um, well, if she agrees to remove it and she does, then that might have a positive effect, but, um, well, so let's, let's just posit that it is market practice and it is that once one's found the seller has to remove it. So I think we shouldn't view that as kind of a credibility building step, although I take your point that you could do it that way. But taking that out of the equation, you are representing Bob. And do you have advice for him about the rest of the negotiation? Well, you might think that she made other misrepresentations. Yeah, so it sounds like you're saying. Now that we know that she either got this wrong or probably was lying, um, we better look especially carefully at everything else that she says, right? Correct. Yeah, yeah, and by the way. Can you imagine a situation where someone might say, you know, I think I'm done with this. Yeah, yeah, um, it seems like the risk of misrepresentations overrides the cost of the deal, right? And so just coming back to that thing we said the first day, sellers always know more than buyers. Buyers need to be very suspicious. There are mechanisms that are supposed to help buyers feel better. It has to do with the seller providing information, but it has to be reliable information. And once the buyer knows that the seller likes to lie. It's a much more risky transaction. Doesn't mean you won't do it. Maybe this house is exactly the house that they want, in which case I want this. We're going to do the work necessary to make sure that we're not being cheated, but it's gonna be more work, right? Or the other alternative is, look, there are a lot of nice houses out there. Let's move on and hopefully we'll find someone whose word means more than hers does because it just seems like we're gonna have to. Have proof of absolutely everything she tells us, and that's, you know, life is too short, this is too hard. OK, questions, comments. All right, thank you. So, um, Sean. Can you help us, please? We move on to part three. So could you read, I'm sorry, part two, the same facts, if you could read that for us please. one. No Washoe box position. I think Bob is likely to ask Susan to fix that. to deduct the expected. Right. Excellent. OK, so, uh, you're taking the position. That this is something the seller needs to fix or pay for, right? That this has to be covered, you know, this is a cost that has to be covered by the seller. Now I predict, knowing our hypothetical seller, that she doesn't like to pay for things and is not the easiest of people. So Shawn, she comes back through her lawyer and says. Feel free to buy it and make it however you like, but I'm not fixing that. That's on you. So we don't wanna give up. What argument would you like to make? And again it can't be because I want you to, uh, and it isn't, you know, bargaining power alone. What, uh, although it'll be a form of it in a way, but, um, what's the principle? What's the argument that you might share in order to try to get this done? I will try to use them. that there is no No. Um has Based on concept So it could be, but let's imagine that we don't have the prior experience of the oil tank, and so we're still negotiating in a way that we're trying to say that this is the seller's responsibility, not the buyer's responsibility. Anybody have a thought they want to share? Yeah, go ahead. All future buyers Yes. It's not just related to him, especially if it's an actually hazardous, dangerous element of the house. Everyone's gonna. Good, and I agree, uh, so keep in mind like in theory you could say, well, it's a health regulation, it's got to be out there, but let's assume there isn't, right, even without that, just the fact that this is unhealthy and very visible is a strong argument that the seller needs to do it because if you play it out and you sort of think, OK, so the buyer says, look, I mean. You buy it, you do what you want, then the seller says, look, this is unhealthy. My inspector is telling me it's dangerous. Every inspector is probably going to tell every potential buyer that it's dangerous, so I'm kind of helping you out here. You have the opportunity just to fix this, and I'm here and I'm willing to buy, but if it doesn't work out for us, you're going to have the same conversation in a couple of weeks when you have another potential buyer. This is going to end up on you, so why not just do it, right? So I agree that's a good point. Did I see a hand a minute ago? Yes, please. I guess with all that stated, I could also ask for her to like reduce the purchase price by the cost of fixing it, um, that way I can bear the cost based on how much I really want this house. Yeah, yeah, and so I would say that there are two co-equal uh responses, right? And one would be seller fixes it and the other is seller reduces the price to pay for it to be fixed by the buyer. And I think either would be fine here um and from the buyer's perspective they may not even care, but the argument is this burden ought to fall either directly or indirectly on the uh the seller and let's continue that analysis so thank you, good point, um, Annie. Can you help us with the next question, which is part B.

SPEAKER 4
Assume that Bob does not like the color and appearance of the oil tank. Is it likely that Susan will bear the expense of replacing it? Is the analysis the same as the request in A about venting the tank? I don't think that she would be open at all to bearing the expense because to the extent that, you know, like the aesthetic and the appearance exceeds the. Like if it adds any additional cost beyond just replacing it, um, It doesn't like the aesthetic appearance doesn't materially change the value of the home or anything.

SPEAKER 0
Good. And so the purpose of this question is really to contrast it with the last question. So any, are they the same or are they different? Because in theory the seller could say about either one. Buy the house, do whatever you want with the oil tank, paint it, change the way it's vented, get a new one. It's up to you. That's the great thing about owning something is you get to choose so she could kind of give the your preference, your choice, your dime, your money. She could give that answer either way. I think we said that it was less persuasive in the last setting. Is this different? I'm sorry, I think I read it as like he

SPEAKER 4
only didn't like the color and appearance.

SPEAKER 0
Yes, correct.

SPEAKER 4
OK, so there's no safety issue. Correct.

SPEAKER 0
So does the analysis change?

SPEAKER 4
I mean, your answer was different, so tell us why. I mean, it doesn't seem like. It's like it could just be a personal preference and other buyers wouldn't really care.

SPEAKER 0
Exactly, so the buyer has a much stronger case when the buyer is speaking for the the group of buyers collectively, right? Everyone who looks at this house is gonna be scared off by this safety issue that you haven't fixed and you need to fix it. But you don't have the same credibility in saying everyone else is gonna want the oil tank to be purple instead of silver, so change it, right? Like no, I mean people like different colors it's a matter of personal preference as you said and the more that something is a matter of individual taste, the more likely it will be that the buyer needs to cover. Changing it, um, the seller is gonna say. I'm happy to hear that you have a preference about that. Buy it and do exactly as you like. It'll be your house. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, um, but you know, harder to say that when it's an issue of safety. So that's the key difference here. Thank you very much, Annie. Questions, comments. OK, so now we're gonna apply that potential principle in a different fact pattern, uh, a different part of it, Charles. Can you help us please with part three? Can you read that? Sure. Yeah, so we have the same facts as problem one, but Ira, the inspector also finds mold in a crawl space beneath the house. This means that there's likely mold spores in the air inside the house, uh, which is not healthy for anyone, but is especially an issue for Bob and his family because they have allergies and various respiratory problems. Ira outlines two steps to eliminate the mold. First, the area must be cleaned thoroughly by professionals who specialize in remediating mold. This step costs approximately $5000. 2nd, to prevent the growth of mold in the future, a pump must be installed to remove water from below the house, and a dehumidifier must be installed to remove moisture from the air. This step costs $2000. So in response to this, Susan says that's not mold, it's just discoloration, which has been there since we bought the house 30 years ago. If it bothers you, I will ask my housekeeper to scrub it thoroughly with bleach and paint over it. So part A is if Bob walks away from this deal, will other buyers care as much about the mold as Bob? I think no because he has respiratory problems and his family have respiratory issues, so they might care less if they don't have these issues, but I think they still would care. Perfect. So I agree. I, I think the idea is this is also a safety issue. It's also something that every buyer would care about to a degree. But the problem points you in the direction that it's a particularly acute issue for this buyer, so it would not be sort of a uniform objection. There would be an interest on the part of every buyer, something being done, but exactly what that something is might vary depending upon the buyer and their situation. And now Charles Part B. If Bob walks away, is another buyer likely to detect the mold? So if another buyer has like an inspector, they probably will detect it, but it's in the crawl space beneath the house, so maybe not every inspector would go beneath into the crawl space, but I think most likely they would detect the mold. So in theory, uh, any inspector. Could find it let's assume that every inspector is diligent and we'll go and look under the crawl space and so if we think other buyers are going to find it, the analysis is gonna feel a lot like the um poorly vented unsafe oil tank and so on, but I think there is potentially a difference here. And so the question is, um, not due to the incompetence or laziness of an inspector, but is there another reason, anybody, another reason why the next buyer might not detect this? Yes. Uh, this might be wrong, but would the seller try to paint over it and make it seem like it's not there? So she's already told us that that's exactly what she plans to do. Darn, I missed that one. Uh, we'll cover it up, right? And so, um, I think I saw another hand. Is that what you were gonna say also? Uh. Um, I was gonna say in a very competitive market, uh, you might end up with offers where it's free, so it doesn't allow for an inspection at all. So fair enough if you're in a situation where some are, are willing to go without an inspection, which basically means they're willing to cover all of the safety issues anyway, then. Then so fair enough, but uh back to a market where uh people are looking at safety. I, I think the big issue here is that let's just say that the seller is not the most honorable of people uh we've already seen that and so she's already volunteered a mechanism that she's thought of which might cover this up which may suggest that actually this is exactly what she'll do well if you don't want it. This is my next step, so let's think about um the possible implications of that. Uh, Rachel, can you help us please with part C?

SPEAKER 5
Assuming that Susan does the same analysis of A and B, what do you expect her position to be? Will she be willing to address the issue? Um, I think she still like would be. Willing to address, she might still be willing to address the issue because there still is a possibility that another buyer could find the mold, but she might not want to bear like all of the costs, maybe only like a smaller part of it because like the buyer has less leverage in this situation.

SPEAKER 0
So, um, have you um ever read any opinions by Oliver Wendell Holmes, the judge?

SPEAKER 5
Yes, I'm sure we did.

SPEAKER 0
OK, good. And do you know in, in this book, The Common Law, I know it sounds like I'm coming out of nowhere, but, but I'm going somewhere with this. In the Common Law, he has this idea of the bad man. People call it the Holmesian bad man. Have you ever heard of that idea? So the law is not what it says in the books. It's what an unethical person can get away with. That's sort of what he's saying and if you wanna be clear eyed and realistic about how legal systems work, look at it from the perspective of people who are trying to take advantage and get away with whatever they can and that line. That they can't cross that's really the law, not the more symbolic command that people like that will disregard so let's now think about let's channel the bad buyer. Uh, because what might the bad buyer think in this situation?

SPEAKER 5
The bad like the buyer is the bad factor or the seller seller um well she's just gonna try and get away with like taking as little bearing as little of the cost as possible, um, so I guess it might depend is like on if she has other buyers like already interested and. Like depending on how quickly she needs this house sold, like she doesn't want the buyer to walk away over this, but if she has other people who might be willing to buy the house and who might have a different purpose for the house or might be less likely to care about the mold, she's gonna be less kind of willing to negotiate because it'll like it's less important to her interests.

SPEAKER 0
And let's imagine a really bad back pattern, which is, there's a huge amount of mold. This is like an explosion of mold, and she's managed to conceal 99% of it. She thought she'd concealed 100%, darn, she missed some. Is there a reason why she might prefer a different buyer entirely?

SPEAKER 5
Uh, well, because this virus particularly sensitive to this issue.

SPEAKER 0
And. The buyer found it. Right, and but now she knows how they found it. Housekeeper, get in there, paint, scrub, bring in the next stupid buyer, right? So, um, the whole point, if you think about this negotiating strategy of anybody else is gonna care, so do it now, it's kind of a threat, it's a nice threat, it's a prediction, not a threat, but, uh, basically it's a way of saying, look, I mean this has to be your expense because anyone in my position is going to say you have to cover it. And here I am ready to buy your house, happy to do this deal, but I only am comfortable doing this deal on the basis that everybody else is gonna do it, so fix it. So will that argument work with bad seller here?

SPEAKER 5
I, I guess not. She's has more leverage just cover it up for the next buyer. She's, she's gonna think I can hide this from the

SPEAKER 0
next buyer, so therefore, no, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna help. So I think um the dynamic here should be the same as with the very dangerous and very visible poorly vented uh heating system. But it may not be the same because it's less visible and the seller might think that it can be concealed better than she has already. Um, questions, comments? Yes, please. OK. OK, my question was just, um, what do you suggest Bob does then in this case, if she is going to be like the worst seller? Yeah, I, I think Bob probably should have left after the oil tank, to be honest, um, but I think basically, uh. Bob should drive as hard a bargain as he can on every issue believing nothing, right? I mean that really is your choice when you find yourself negotiating with someone who has openly tried to mislead you and you caught them. It's not unusual to say this isn't for me, but you might decide that this deal has value to you that is unique and you really want it, in which case you're gonna log a lot of hours trying to nail down every detail. So good question, excellent question. OK, um, Irene. Uh, let's turn to. Good. Uh, part D, uh, part D, if Susan agrees. So if Susan agrees to address the issue, why might Bob worry that she won't address it as carefully as he would? And if he has this concern, what alternative can he suggest to resolve the issue? Um, I think Bob, based on all these precedents would probably worry that Susan will choose the cheapest, kind of least thorough fix out of all the options. So to address his concern, I guess he could propose that he would control the remediation, but then would then try to drive a price reduction or a closing credit requirement on the house. Exactly, so here we're abstracting away from the fact that the seller is a crook who's trying to hide things and let's say she is honorable enough and recognizes that she ought to do something because other buyers will want it too. The nuance here is that what other buyers will want won't be at the same level as what Bob wants because we've already said Bob's. Bob has a particular interest in this issue, a particular sensitivity to mold, etc. and so if you imagine a world where there's sort of the regular solution and the platinum plus solution, he's gonna want the platinum plus solution and other people are not and given that you have an issue because the best you're gonna do with her is probably to say pay for the regular, right? Pay for what other people will want. But it isn't what you want and so uh you've just given us the right answer, which is he should do the work because he should figure out the level that he wants and it can be platinum plus and she should bear some of the expense, but the portion of the expense that she should bear should be ref should reflect what the regular not platinum plus solution would be. So if this costs, you know, $15,000 for the platinum plus and $5000 for the regular, she ought to cut the price by $5000 and then he'll put in an extra 10 of his own to try to get it the way he wants it. Makes sense? OK, so let's move on then to uh due diligence issue sort of due diligence that cannot be completely resolved in the appropriate time so our example is a swimming pool and so um. Aye, you. Can you help us, please? Uh, I know there's a bit of language to read, but can you read part four? Is a problem to The house has a pool, a nice feature for a weekend house. Bob wants the pool to be attractive. Resurfacing the pool costs approximately $10,000. Bob also wants to be sure that the pool systems are in working order. For example, the heater should work, the drainage pipes should not be clogged or leak, and the motorized filter which cleans the pool should also work. Repairing all of these systems would cost approximately $15,000. In addition, the pool needs all the necessary safety features. For example, the pool needs to have a fence so no one accidentally falls in and so no uninvited guests use the pool and are injured. Indeed, to get homeowners insurance, Bob needs to show the insurance company that there is a fence. It costs $2000 to install a fence. The pool also should have two drains instead of one in order to reduce the suction from each drain. Otherwise, the suction might be strong enough to pull swimmers down to the drain, causing them to drown. Installing a second drain costs $8000. Um Bob is doing his due diligence in late January. The pool has been covered for the winter and there is snow on the ground, so Bob is limited in the due diligence he can do it. For example, although he can have the cover removed, the pool systems are not designed to work in freezing temperatures. Turning the systems on when the temperature is less than 50 °F, as almost certainly will be the case in late January, can cause the systems to break. Bob is willing to delay the closing until the weather is warmer. But Susan wants the closing to take place no later than March 1st. Thank you. So now, uh, let's turn to Part A, which issues can Bob explore before March 1st and which cannot be investigated before March 1st? Um So let's start in we'll go in order. The first is, um, does the pool look nice? Does the surfacing of, you know, the way it's surfaced, is it pretty or is he gonna need to redo that himself? Is that something that they can check? Uh yes. I agree, yes, right? So if we're talking about the pool deck now there might have to be some shoveling of snow done so that you can look at it. But this can be done if it's the inside of the pool, you can have someone to open the pool, you can look on the inside. So, uh, I do think that that would be possible even, um, in January or February to do. All right, let's turn to the next thing, uh, pool systems. Can we do that one? Um. I would, I would imagine no because there's a cover covering the pool and I would imagine you can't do the test with the cover. Um, so we could take the cover off, but what the question tells you is that turning the pool system on when it is, uh, below 50 °F will break the systems. And since what you want to know is whether the pool systems are broken, uh, turning it on when the weather is cold. Will be a self fulfilling prophecy, so can we do this test? Um, no. No, we cannot and uh uh at the risk of hyper intellectualizing this you can think of this as sort of like the Heisenberg uncertainty principle of cool systems by checking it you break it, so this one you cannot do. we've hit a due diligence problem but let's see about the other things, um, so can we check whether there is a fence? Uh, yes, you can. Yes, even with snow, you should be able to see the fence. Can we check whether there are two drains instead of one? Um, I would imagine the drain is like outwardly visible, so probably. Yes, yes, it is. You, you'd have to remove the cover and they'll show you where it is. Look, there's 1, there's 2. So I think the point is that some of this due diligence, a lot of it can be done in time for that March 1st closing, but some of it cannot. And so now we have to figure out what to do. So that brings us to Part B. Uh, so Min, uh, can I ask for your help with Part B? If Susan insists on closing before March 1st, what should Bob suggest as a way to address his concerns about the pool and specifically about issues that cannot be investigated before March 1st? So I actually think there are three things that are potentially. Uh, things he can suggest. I, I even think that there's an order in which they ought to be suggested, but let's just start with what comes to mind for you. Uh, I guess he can suggest a partial refund. If problems are present and he found out later. Good. OK. So, uh, partial refund meaning I'll pay you, we'll close the deal, but if I find a problem, I'll come look for you. I'll find you. You'll be nice. You've always been nice before and you'll write me a check at that point. So are we depending maybe a little bit on our capacity to find her and to persuade her to give us back some of the money we've given? So I think, I think that idea is right, but I think we probably aren't gonna give her the money. Or we can switch it as in, I'm gonna pay you, let's say 85% or like 90% and then when no problem or presents, then I can send you the remaining 10%. Good. And I think that's where this is going to end up is and it's, it's known as an escrow arrangement which is, uh, I promised you. $1030 or whatever the price is, um, but it looks like the pool systems, you know, that they may be broken and if they're broken my understanding is it costs what is the problem, say $15,000 so I'm not gonna pay you the full purchase price we're gonna hold back $15,000. It's gonna be in a special escrow account held by your lawyer or mine you pick and then once the condition is satisfied, meaning. If the weather's good. I turn on the pool systems and they work, then you get the rest of the money. But if they don't work, then we're going to use as much of that 15,000 as we need in order to do the necessary repairs. OK? So I do think that that's where this will end up. Uh, if I were negotiating this though, I would come to that last because people don't like escrow. Like it, it's, it's a nuis it's a nuisance. It takes time. It takes a bit of effort, and, um, it's, it's actually not uncommon in the US in some jurisdictions it's really uncommon because it's such a headache, but it's not, it's not simple. People will resist it. So, uh, there's something I would start with before. So, uh, Pauline, Uh, do you have a thought? Like you're doing this negotiation and so you've encountered this issue like there's something we can't test and, uh, so therefore, like what would be the simplest way to deal with this, the very simplest. Sorry to deal with, um, there's this information that I, the buyer, don't have. I need it in order to close this transaction, um, and the information is I need to know if the pool systems work. So is there something we can do that would allow us to test whether these things work in a way that won't break them? I think the easiest way is just to ask the previous owner if they were already working, but he's probably not likely to do that here. Yeah, I think we don't trust the other side, but you're right, like a rep. Accompanied by the kind of escrow arrangement that me and I were discussing, we, we could do that, but actually like. The simplest, most straightforward way would be. Let's not close until we've tested. And so what does that mean? What would that involve here? If they don't close until March, I mean that puts the parties in different positions. She may not want to close in March. She may want to close sooner than that. Well, so the idea is she wants to close on March 1st, but does the problem say that the buyer is also insisting on closing by March 1st? No, buyer is patient. The seller is not so. True or false, a good first position for the buyer would be to say, look, I can't close until I know if this stuff works, and we can't test whether it works until, I don't know, April, the earliest, late April, so let's close in May. Is there any downside to the buyer in starting with that? I mean, it leverages both of their positions, I think. I think if she really wants to close in January, for example, she might say like, OK, well, actually I have another buyer that's willing to take it as is, so I'm going to go ahead and move on. But also it takes a long time. Like people don't buy a house in a week. It takes a while. So therefore, Let's say you know that she's gonna say look I've already told you I have to close by March 1st. are you wasting words by saying why don't we close in May? Or do you have a sort of a tactical reason to start with that? Yeah, I think it pushes her to just act a little bit faster, maybe go ahead and accept like the escrow agreement that we mentioned earlier, um, good, look, she's not gonna like the escrow, she's gonna dismiss it like you're just some crazy compulsive person and I've already told you everything was working in the spring and this is completely unreasonable and this, that and the other, so it's actually not a bad thing to put her on her back foot a bit by saying I'm in no hurry. I love the house. I'm happy to buy it. Let's set a date for May 15th. I'll sign right now. Let's do it. Well, well, no, I can't. What, what do you mean you can't? I mean. We also can't test this equipment, so I, I mean there are a lot of things we wish we could do and we can't do, so I think we have to delay. No, no, we really can't. I need to close by. OK, OK, I understand. Look, I want to accommodate you and so therefore, so then what's the second thing we suggest? Uh, I'm just about out of time. What's the second thing we should suggest? Hint, not escrow. I think escrow comes 3. So does anybody want to volunteer what you would offer next? Go ahead. I mean, I was just thinking like if you don't mind fixing it yourself, just ask to subtract that from the selling price of the house. You know, I'm just gonna assume this is gonna cost me $15,000. I can accommodate you. Let's just cut $15,000 from the purchase price and we're done and I meet your timetable and she's gonna say, well, I don't like that very much because it's working. I know it's working. And then the escrow seems reasonable, right? OK, I'm not, I, I was just trying to accommodate you. Let's set aside $15,000 you'll get it if you're right, but if not, OK. So on Wednesday, we're gonna finish this discussion and then start the discussion of M&A. Looking forward to seeing you all then. Thanks, everybody. to questions.
