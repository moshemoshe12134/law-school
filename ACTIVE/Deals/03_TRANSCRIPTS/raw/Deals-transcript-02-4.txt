2. So good to see everybody. Last time we were talking about the purchase of residential real estate and basically what we're doing is we're developing the major theme of this class, which is that there are information and incentive problems that arise in every transaction because the seller always knows more than the buyer, knowing that the buyer will be suspicious and the buyer might decide at the end of the day not to. Go forward with the transaction. So, um, in this, so one of the strategies that buyers use is due diligence. They try to ask questions to get answers to the things that they most want to know. And what we've seen is that there are, there are different kinds of information that you can get. One is the answer to your question, but the second is that there is information. In the fact that someone doesn't answer your question, usually that is negative information, but we began this discussion with the hypothetical in which the seller offered different justifications for her conclusion that there was no. Uh, underground oil tank and what I observed is that when you see this kind of inconsistency, it's a red flag and it could easily mean that this deal is not meant to be because you just can't trust this person. Alternatively, if it's a deal that you still want to pursue, you're going to have to ramp up your efforts in trying to confirm facts and to explore potential risks. So we then moved on to the idea that when you negotiate and you want something, merely saying some version of but I want it is not an effective strategy. It is a way to maybe remind people of the bargaining power you have, but you want to be selective in the way you invoke bargaining power because it applies in every term. And you're probably better off finding other ways to justify what you want so that you save the bargaining power for other things like a more favorable price uh in the transaction. And so the example we were looking at was this idea of um an unsafe feature of the house and so what we said about that was um. You can push hard on that to the extent that you're confident that other potential buyers would have the same concern and that the seller would realize that other potential buyers would have the same concern because if that's true, then there's a way in which it doesn't make sense for the seller to keep pushing back. If you walk away, she's going to have the same negotiation with somebody else along with the delay and effort associated with having to start over again. With someone else. So when it came to this very visible problem with the, uh, heating, the, the, the heat being improperly vented, this is the sort of thing. Where uh you can expect the seller to give ground, uh, or you as a seller would probably need to give ground if you were in that position. This is in contrast to the idea of things that are aesthetic, how something looks, that's a matter of taste. Not every buyer will have the same judgment as to whether something is pretty or ugly, attractive, unattractive, and so sellers can more easily say, look, that's, that's your preference. I respect that, and of course buy this and you can change it however you like, but it isn't my responsibility. Um, to do that, you should make it the way you want it after you buy it, etc. We then saw that there is a risk that things that are about safety can be concealed. This was our mold example, in which case you have less negotiating power as a buyer than you might think because the seller is not thinking, Oh no, I'm going to have to deal with this with every other buyer. The seller may be thinking, Well, I wish I'd caught this before, but for the next potential buyer I'm going to hide it better. And so the negotiating dynamic is different uh again I hope that when you are in that position of trying to decide what to disclose and what to hide that you err in the direction of being forthcoming. I think in the long run the reputation you develop will be worth it and uh again I I generally prefer not to continue with the negotiation when the person has been exposed. Is not being truthful because I just think there are so many things they could lie about and I'll never know this isn't worth the effort uh and so if a lot of people think that way and I think they do, there is a financial return as well as a a good feeling associated with saying and doing the right thing but when you're negotiating with someone, particularly someone you've never dealt with before, you have to recognize that they may have a different view about that and they may be looking to get away with whatever they can and so. You've heard me say it before I say it again, be paranoid. Part of the job of a really good lawyer is to be paranoid but not defeatist because it doesn't mean that it's over, it just means you have to account for that information and modify your strategy to adjust for it. OK. In that spirit we were then looking at this issue of pool systems, and that was an example of the limits of due diligence at particular points in time. Most of the due diligence about the pool could be done in time for a March 1st closing, but not all of it, not all of it, because. And this is actually true. This is, I didn't, I didn't make it up, but with pool systems when the weather is too cold, if you, if you turn them on to test them, they will break. So actually doing due diligence in the winter for something like that is not really a feasible thing to do in certain parts of the world. So what do you do? My, my advice on this was start by saying let's just wait if you're in a position to wait, say it even if you know the other side isn't in a position to wait because it forces them to say sorry but I can't wait, which means they're kind of making a demand of you, in which case your next move is to say, OK, look, I mean. If we have to proceed before we can verify this, then I, I'm sorry to say it, but I, I'm just gonna have to assume that it doesn't work and it'll cost me X to fix and so let's just reduce the price and then on that basis I'm happy to go ahead. Well, the buyer might reluctantly say yes or she might say no, no, no, but it, it actually works. That's not right because you should pay for this since it is working. And I think the backup at that point is to say, look, we can put this money aside, put it in escrow, then we'll test it. And at that point if it works you'll get the rest of the purchase price. If it doesn't work, we'll take as much of that money as we need to repair it and you'll get whatever's left if anything is left. So, uh, and I, I mentioned that sequencing because I think that if you start, uh, and this is by the way, one of the frustrating things about a negotiation, particularly if you're impatient as I am by nature, you know where it's gonna end up. It would be nice if reasonable people could just start there, agree to it, and so on, but I think there is often a rhythm to this where people often feel like they gave up too easily if they just agree to the very first thing that you suggested, which is why knowing where you wanna end up but perhaps not starting there is, uh, a, a, a common strategy that you will probably use at some points in your careers. OK, so but there is this difference that we've posited. Between matters of safety and function on the one hand and aesthetic matters, issues of appearance, and so I think where we were is um. I think we were in part, it's part 4, And I think it was part 4C, is that right? I think we're at part 4C. OK, so let's pick it up there, but first, any questions or comments on what we've been discussing. OK. Very good, um, Pauline. Uh, can you help us with Part C? Yeah, Susan is willing. OK, Susan is willing to assure Bob that the pole systems work and are safe, but if you want the pole to look different, that's your responsibility, she says. You can make any changes you want to the appearance of the pool once you buy the house, but that expense is your responsibility. Does this distinction seem reasonable? If so, how can Bob and Susan? operationalize it. So what do you think? Um Yeah, I'm sure every buyer of the pool wants the system to work, but I mean, not every buyer is going to have the same aesthetic preferences to how the pool looks, so I mean. I, I doubt that she's going to, to budge on that issue. Great, so I think this is gonna be market practice. So then the question is how do they operationalize this? And just to be clear about the context, so they've basically come to an understanding that $15,000 I think that's what we said, is the cost of a potential repair up to that much, we're gonna set aside $15,000 as a purchase price in escrow. Uh, and it will be released to the seller once we see that the systems are working, but if the systems aren't working, then, uh, some or all of that money is going to be used to pay for repairs. So that much will be in the contract. But then I think what we need is we need some language to explain what can and what cannot be funded with that $15,000 in escrow, so. And someone is volunteering the answer, but we're not gonna let him do it. You're gonna do it instead. So Pauline, what, what do you think it should say? Um, yeah, I think in the contract you can just specify that, um, any money that's being held in escrow is. To be used solely for I guess maintenance of the pool, um, or should or I guess you could directly specify should not be used for any, um, aesthetic appearances of the pool. Right, I think that that's the, the general gist is it's gonna be something like the money in escrow shall be used to fund necessary repairs to ensure that the. Pool system functions properly but none of these funds shall be used uh for aesthetic improvements in the pool or to make the pool look more attractive and so on. OK, so I think that is the line now I said before be paranoid and part of being paranoid is looking for situations where someone might cheat you or your client and the other aspect of that or another aspect of that is try to. Look ahead to how a reasonable idea might go off the rails what problem can arise and so of course if you have language in place there's always a risk that you didn't think of an issue that'll come up and it won't be entirely clear how the language applies and the parties will have different incentives to read it one way or the other and so Pauline back to you. Um, if part D, if Susan and Bob proceed with the idea in C. Can you predict, uh, predict not prediction, sorry, can you predict any scenarios in which they disagree about whether an expense is addressing safety or aesthetic issues? This is the distinction we're trying to draw, but could it be vague? Could they dispute it? If so, is there a language that you might suggest to deal with it? So before we turn to language, let's try to think of situations in which this might go wrong. Anything come to mind? Yeah, I think if you're operating on a pool's maintenance systems, those are usually underneath the foundation of the pool itself, so it's likely that they're going to have to pick up like the pool deck or they're going to have to, you know, make a hole in, in the side of the pool for whatever reason, or, you know, even if it's not inside the pool, it's the area surrounding the pool as well, um, so I guess that's a situation in which that you could potentially alter the physical appearance of the pool, but the goal of that. Of that alteration is to access the maintenance. So excellent Gold Star, that is the problem that we face here, which is much of the work that might need to be done to make the systems functional might also create gaping holes one place or another. And so then the point is, uh, Bob the buyer, he did the repair. And he spent some money and now he's ready to fill in the hole in the wall and the seller says wait a minute that's aesthetic, right? I, I didn't agree to cover that so. Just stepping back on the deal that we think they meant to strike or the reasonable deal they could have struck, what do you think the right answer is there? Um, I pay for, you know, fixing the wall. Of the pool or the deck. I mean at that point I think it's going to depend on what the fix is going to be to fix the wall or to fix the deck because it, you know, you could just replace it, replace the cement as it was, or you could say, well we already tore it down once, so now I want to install this higher grade cement or I want or that's more expensive or or just make an alteration because you're already. Dealing with the demolition. Perfect. Yes, I agree. So, um, do you ever, do you ever swim? Do you like to swim? I have a pool at home. OK. So wouldn't it be great to have like diamonds studded throughout the pool? It would look really nice, wouldn't it? And so if Bob's vision of Just covering up that wall is, but you know we're gonna add a few diamonds to it and um by the way, it would be a little weird to have diamonds only in the place where we broke through the wall, so we're gonna redo the whole thing and we're gonna put diamonds throughout, but you know it's still part of making the system work and so therefore she should pay for it and you agree, right? She should pay for it, the seller. I agree that she should pay for the aesthetic. The diamonds, yeah, I, I don't think that she should have to pay for the diamonds. You don't agree. I don't agree either, um, and so I think the standard that you articulated is right, which is if all you're doing with this aesthetic component of the project is restoring it to the way it looked before or to the approximate condition it was in before. Then really it's not an aesthetic repair, it's the fact that you had this functional repair you had to make the system work and in order to do that there was aesthetic harm that had to be remedied so that you're back where you started so that on one hand should be covered by the seller. On the other hand, any effort to. You know, change the way it looked to improve the way it looked beyond the way it looked before this repair that shouldn't count, right? That, that's the kind of thing the seller shouldn't have to pay for and so I think the good lawyer is gonna anticipate that and write the language accordingly. There'll be an extra sentencing by aesthetic repair. We mean efforts to upgrade or improve the appearance beyond the way you know to be better than the way it looked before this repair was undertaken, um, but efforts um to you know, efforts to make it better not covered efforts to restore it are covered. OK, well done any questions or comments? Yeah, please go ahead. I guess my question would be, how do we then like define what better, like making it look better looks like from, from that perspective, like how do you like. Someone could argue, oh, I think that the diamonds actually make it look worse in the end. Good. So, um, I'm gonna say, Addison, if only I knew a very smart law student who might have a suggestion for how to do this. Hey, what do you think? What should we do? Um, I guess maybe you could try to do it based off of like market value, like have an appraiser come in and just sort of appraise the value of the pool, and it can't go over that value of the pool if it wants to go under. I guess that's their own prerogative. So you could do that. That would be pretty precise. I think a little bit more of a simple approach would be just, is it going to look different. And you know then once you say different it doesn't have to look you don't have to make a judgment about whether it's nicer or uglier um and and so that that would be my initial reaction but but good idea and uh. One of the uh broader themes in the class and we've just illustrated it but I'm gonna make it explicit now is we had an information problem does this pull system work or not? Um, we found a way to bridge that gap so the deal could close. She needed to sell by March 1st he couldn't check this before March 1st so they could easily have gone their separate ways. But maybe he's gonna love this house and maybe it's a good price and this deal should have happened so we found a solution for this information gap, um, which is this escrow, uh, but then there's an incentive problem that comes out of it which is as soon as you divide the money and say that the escrow is authorized for this but not for that the seller is obviously gonna have the incentive to say that wasn't authorized. The buyer is obviously gonna have the incentive to say everything was authorized diamonds, etc. and so then what you need to do is you have to provide for a predictable incentive problem through uh and you know in the first instance always say how could someone misuse this back to our Holmes and bad man that I was referring to the other day um if someone is about just getting as much as she can get away with. How would she construe this language? What would she try to do with it? And once we anticipate that, how can we revise the language to make that kind of strategic interpretation harder to justify? OK, other questions, comments? All right, very good. Let's turn then to our next iteration, uh, within this fact pattern, and this is actually one about regulatory arbitrage, so we'll change subjects here. Uh, Alex. Could you help please? So, uh, could you read 5 for us?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, um, same facts as above. In asking $1.1 million for the house, Susan has offered to include outdoor furniture, art, exercise equipment, beds, a dining room table, and other personal property. This personal property was worth approximately $50,000. Since this is a second home for Bob, he liked the idea of buying this personal property as well. When they settled on the price of $1,030,000 as noted above, this included the personal property. Before signing a contract, Bob reaches out to you. As a real estate lawyer, you know that New York, where Purdy County is located, has a mansion tax. Under this tax, a buyer pays 1% of the value of any home with a purchase price of $1 million or more. This tax does not apply to a home with a purchase price of less than $1 million. New York also charges an 8% sales tax on sales of personal property. While this obviously applies to purchases in a store, it also applies at garage sales and in other circumstances when one individual buys personal property from another, as long as the total price of all the property is more than the minimum amount, which you should assume here is $500. The town where the house is located also has an annual property tax of 3%. Of a house's appraised value, the town's last appraisal three years ago valued Susan's house at $800,000 so she has been paying property taxes of $24,000 per year. The town is likely to use Bob's purchase price as a valuation for his property taxes.

SPEAKER 0
Great, well done. So basically we have three taxes here. Uh, we have the mansion tax which the buyer will pay if the purchase price is above a million dollars. We have sales tax which the buyer would also pay uh if they're if they're sort of separately buying the personal property and then there's the property tax that the buyer is gonna pay every year. Um, 3% of the appraised value of the of the house. So our job as lawyers in this transaction is to figure out whether there are different structures which would cause one or more of those taxes to be higher or lower and then to try to find the structure that would minimize the sum of all three. So back to you with part A please.

SPEAKER 1
Um, Susan's lawyer sends over a contract which includes the following language. The party's here to acknowledge that there's no consideration attributable to the personal property included here under there. In light of this language, what taxes will Bob owe, which will he avoid? Um, in this case I think Bob will owe like the 1% mansion tax, um, since the, um, value of the mansion is over a million dollars and so this will come out to be $10,300.

SPEAKER 0
Excellent. So that's one tax that is owed with this characterization of the transaction, um, and then I think he would

SPEAKER 1
also owe the 3% annual property tax. Um, which will come out to, um, 30,900 dollars per year.

SPEAKER 0
Good, so you're gonna owe 3% every year of the value of the house, which is now gonna be described as 1300 million. Often there's sort of a, uh, an inflation factor that the town will apply so like everybody's house is assumed to have increased in value by 1% and so it'll just be 3% and where you start. Uh, the 130 sort of sets where you're gonna be, so that's relevant, and the sales tax.

SPEAKER 1
Oh yeah, um, so Bob will avoid paying the 8% sales tax, um, and since the personal property is worth $50,000 he is saving $4000.

SPEAKER 0
Um, OK, so the point is there's no sales tax in this structure, and you might say, but I don't understand the property is worth 50,000 aren't isn't this cheating and you know, basically the, um, there are people who will just sort of describe this as you bought the house and the seller threw in the rest of it and you didn't really pay for the rest of it. Uh, so you, you have a bit of discretion about whether to describe the transaction that way or in another way which we'll think about, uh, and to be clear, none of this is illegal per se, uh, we're not, you know, illegal possibilities are off the table in this discussion, but there is some flexibility about how you value these different components. So, uh, Rachel, can you help us please? Let's turn to part B. What suggestion can you make that will reduce Bob's tax bill in the coming years? Please note that Bob will still have to pay Susan a total of $1.3 million or $03 million. That's not negotiable and that Bob is very conservative about tax planning. He will only do something that is clearly legal. Um, I was thinking something that he could do was pay for the personal property separately because including that had Cause him to go over the $1 million threshold for the uh the mansion tax and so by separating that he can avoid the additional $10,300 tax, um. And pay it through sales tax instead. Very good. So that's our other option. The other option is to say I'm still paying you $1,030,000 but $50,000 of it is for the personal property. And the other 980,000 of it is for the house. So now we're gonna go through each of our three taxes, and you've already, uh, told us a bit about that. But, um, so let's start. Is the mansion tax owed if the purchase price on the house is 980,000? No. No. And for those of you who ever do buy a house in New York state, it is the rule, has been for a long time, probably still will be, uh, at the moment when you buy. And um if you try to get data from the sort of New York tax authorities what you will see is that an astonishing number of homes in New York sell for $999,000 and the truth is when you're as close as that or frankly even $20,000.01 of the issues is there's probably gonna be an audit. Because what some people would do, which is illegal, is to say, hey, I know you want $50,000. I know you want a $50,000 for this. I will pay you $51,000 in cash in this suitcase here you go, and the reported price is going to be right and this is tax fraud and you can't do that, um, but on the other hand, if what you're doing is, is, is a substantive matter. There's a purchase not just of the home but of other things that genuinely are worth $50,000 then you can reallocate and uh you might still get audited but you can then just demonstrate look here here's what I bought and it it presumably will will work OK so this avoids the mansion tax that's an that's an advantage we're saving $10,300. What about the sales tax? Um, Are we paying that now? I think now you are increasing your sales tax. Yes, so we now have to pay an 8% tax on, um, $50,000. So that's $4000. We're still better off saving the $10,300 and paying the $4000. There's one other effect that we should talk about. What's the third tax? Um, Is it the, the difference between the annual property tax and what's different is, is the sales tax annual or is it one time? The sales tax is paid once, one time, and is the mansion tax annual or is it paid one time? The mansion is also 11 time, right? But the sales tax you pay every year. And so the question is which structure reduces your sales tax, allocating a portion of the purchase price of the property or allocating it all to the house? I think it depends on how long. You are intending to that's where we're going, but um in terms of. So yeah, so, so continue because we we can basically allocate but but I think the answer to the the specific question I was asking is, is more straightforward so I'm gonna pay 3% every year, forget about the other taxes am I better off paying 3% on a higher purchase price or a lower purchase price? A lower purchase price price. And which of these structures gives you the lower purchase price for the home? A 0 allocation to the property or a 50,000 allocation to the property. Zero, so the 50, in other words, you take the $50,000 that you were gonna pay for the house, you buy something else with it, and now when you report your property taxes, your purchase price was 980, not $1300 which means that we're saving 3% of that difference, which is $50,000 which I think is $1500 if I'm doing the math right. So what's interesting here is when we decide which of these is better, avoiding the mansion tax makes it clear. But let's say that Governor Hochle signs legislation just before this deal is done. The mansion tax is gone, and so now what we have is we can have a lower property tax saving 3% a year. Or we can have a sales tax one time you pay 8000, I'm sorry, 8%. Which of these is better? And so no back now back to you because the only answer to that is it depends. And what does it depend on? It depends on how long you're going to or you intend on having the house. Exactly. It depends on how long you expect to live there. Because obviously 3% is less than 8%, so if you only plan to live in this house for 1 year and then you're gonna sell it, pay the 3%. Don't pay the 8% sales tax if you think you're gonna be there for 2 years. Well, that's still 6% and based on my elementary school math I'm confident in telling you that 6% is less than 8%, but once you get to 3 years and 9%, it's better. So this is a trade-off depending upon how long you're gonna live there. So, very good. Um, and the point here is. You could do pretty much the same thing economically. Either way, at the end of the day, our client is going to own the house and the personal property, but the allocation of the purchase price, the law actually gives you some. Discretion to do that one way or the other, uh, and to be clear, you can't, you know, allocate a million dollars to the personal property and $30,000 to the house like that that's it, it has to be a plausible evaluation, but these are plausible valuations so what we have then is we have two economically similar situations. Being taxed differently and an effective lawyer in a deal is gonna be aware of the difference and will steer the client in that direction and particularly when you know in a situation where you're either the mansion tax has been repealed or your purchase price is far enough above the threshold that you're gonna pay it either way in that situation it really does become exactly the trade-off you described. Well you can pay 8% up front. To save yourself 3% per year on the amount that you allocate, how long are you gonna be there? And that's really the way it comes, the, the way to answer it, questions, comments. Please Hi, um, in this case, Susan, the seller is indifferent to the kind of tax strategies that Bob wants to implement as long as she receives the total amount of money. Um, is there a situation ever when there is a difference in, in terms of incentive for the buyer wants to have the property price be as high as possible instead of. You know, include property as well, right? So, um, I, I, I don't think you're asking the, the, the, the, the question at this level of generality, but I'll start by answering, saying that constantly, you know, there are competing tax considerations, which is why I emphasized in our initial discussion you have to think about both sides of the transaction here under the state tax law. There doesn't seem to be any particular difference um where the federal but but but what we didn't talk about here so you know not responsible for this but I'll just mention it anyway. Is from the seller's perspective she might have gained on the house for federal tax purposes she'll sell it and there's potential capital gain there and then under the law you can exclude $250,000 of that or or $500 if you're married filing jointly. So if she has just over $500,000 of gain, um, that she'd like and she'd like to exclude all of it and not have to pay tax, she might find it very tempting. To allocate money to the um property because that will reduce her purchase price on the house and uh I'm sorry, her sale price on the house and therefore her capital gains tax uh again because it's unlikely that she's gonna have a gain on this personal property at best she'd get some fraction of what she paid for it it's used after all, um, so I think that might come into play but I didn't include it here. Other questions or comments? All right, let's move on to the next one. And so, uh, Ryan. Um, can you help us please with part six, the same facts as above, if you could read that.

SPEAKER 2
Yes, the same facts as and above. Susan's lawyer sends over the attached draft which among other things is supposed to address the following issues. How does the draft treat these issues? Uh, what changes, if any, would you suggest for each? Ira. OK, um, Ira's inspection yields a list of minor repairs that are needed for the house to be in working order. Susan commits to do them before the closing, um, and Bob wants her to use a licensed contractor for these repairs, i.e., and not to do them herself or to ask someone who is not an expert to do them. Um, Bob wonders how he can confirm that all the work was done, especially since some of it involves electrical work inside the walls of the house. What does the draft provide and what change, if any, would you suggest? Hint focus on the two clauses in the writer. Um Let's see. The writer says that the seller represents the appliances and systems are in working order and be working order at closing. Mhm. And that the seller will complete the work. On the list at the seller's sole cost and expense.

SPEAKER 0
Those are exactly the two provisions, absolutely. So are there words that you'd like to add or change there?

SPEAKER 2
Well, Bob, it says that Bob wants her to use a licensed contractor, but we don't have anything in the. The writing about that.

SPEAKER 0
Exactly. So that 5 item prior to the closing of title, the seller will complete the work on the punch list attached. Using a licensed contractor and then we continue so that actually would normally be there. I took it out so that we could say we had to put it back in but that yes that would be one place very good and in terms of his making sure that it happened anything you'd like to see down there?

SPEAKER 2
Um, I guess after the work is done we should be able to inspect it. Yes, yes, so part 4, the seller represents that it's

SPEAKER 0
working and then part 5 it's all been done. There ought to be some language about, about inspection. Very good, thank you. Um, let's turn to the next 11 of my personal favorites here. Moshe, uh, can you help us please with Part B? Susan built a guest apartment. So it's Susan built a guest apartment over the garage and applied for a permit from the town which would allow her and any subsequent owner to rent out the apartment to tenants. Bob wants to make sure that the town has in fact issued a permit or a so-called certificate of occupancy for the apartment. What does the draft provide? What change, if any, would you suggest? And again, we should look at the rider. Uh, yeah. So Uh, the question is, should Susan share in the cost of the scan? Uh, no, no, no, Is that not, no, no. So I tell you what, maybe I'll, maybe I'll come back, come back to you. Yeah, I'm looking at the wrong place. I apologize. Let's see. Charles, Uh, so can you help us with this one, which is, um, The certificate of occupancy language in the writer. I went last. OK, um. Nia, It's not here. Let's see now here, OK, do I have a volunteer for this one? Thank you. OK, so what's wrong with the writer as it is? Uh, the writer number one says current draft is it requires the CEO if a building permit has previously been issued. What if there's no building permit in the first place? Right, and that's the, uh, if they, if she built it illegally, no permits, she doesn't need to have uh provide us uh. CO, good. So could you, um, could you read the language we're looking at writer number one, Wrider number one. So could you read this because you're right that this language is flawed because I changed it to make it flawed, but everybody should read it. Because the, the point here is a lot of people would look at this and not see a problem, so read it for us. Number 1, at the time of closing, the final certificates of occupancy shall have been issued for all work performed at the premises for which building permits have been issued. So you are qualifying it by saying for which the building permits have been issued, and that what if that's not the case. So what should this say instead? So you have to provide a certificate of occupancy for that extra guest house no matter what because that implies that you have a building permit for it. And, and no matter what you have, you must provide. At the time of closing, if it's required under law, you have to have it, right? So what this used to say before I changed it was at the time of the closing, the final certificate of occupancy shall have been issued for all work performed at the premises for which building permits are required. For which building permits are required, that's what it should say. But instead, because it says for which building permits have been issued, this is basically now, uh, Juan, do you know the word tautological? This is circular. This is like permits have been issued where permits have been issued. Thanks for telling me that. Super helpful. No, not helpful at all, right? So the point is we have to read carefully because, um, it is not unusual for people to read that and think, oh I guess that's about right. No, it's not at all right. So if you've signed something that says this and then you find out that there was. They told me there was a permit. There's no permit. What can I do? Well, you can't really do anything because this language didn't say there was a permit whenever you needed one. It just said there are permits where there are permits, which is a nonsensical thing to do. Thank you. Thank you for that. All right, let's move on to the next one. But first, any questions, comments? Right. So Addison, can you help us with the next, the, the next one please? Uh, part C, I think it is. Um, so it says Bob is borrowing money to buy the house. He wants to be excused from the contract. Uh, if after reasonable efforts he is unable to secure a mortgage, what does the draft provide? What change, if any, would you, uh, suggest, so. In the main contract, I didn't see any mortgage contingency and so perhaps we could add something like this into the contract itself, precisely. And in fact it says something about a mortgage. It says it's omitted, omitted, right? Uh, do you know when a contract would be written that way so the mortgage contingency is omitted? Like, would that be if it was an all cash offer? Yes, yes. Sometimes people will buy without borrowing money and actually that, and, and so Addison. If you're ever in that fortunate position where you can say I'll pay cash, I don't need a mortgage, um, you usually will try and usually will succeed in getting a discount on the price, you know why? Um, Does it have to do with the, like having to work with basically like a bank to, to, to get them to like come in and inspect so it's just more of a hassle and it's not only a hassle, although there is more of a hassle associated with mortgage involved, um, but what is a mortgage contingency? What does the word contingency suggest? Oh, it's not guaranteed either. Right, so, um, if. Bob needs a loan in order to buy this, so he wants a so-called mortgage contingency. It's not there. Took it out because, you know, if you cash purchaser, you wouldn't need it, but what do you have a sense of what it would say? Um, it would probably say that it's contingent upon the bank coming in and inspecting it properly. Well, not so much inspecting the property, um, oh, the person having money to, to get it. So the idea is the standard home purchase will say buyer is committing to do this. I'm signing the contract. I'm putting down, call it 10% as a deposit, which is not unusual, and then if the deal doesn't close and it's the buyer's fault, the seller keeps the 10%, and that's compensation for having devoted time and effort to a deal that didn't happen and then she'll move on and try to find another buyer, um, but the point is. You don't get your 10% back if you say I changed my mind. I don't want it anymore, but do you get your 10% back if there's a mortgage contingency and the bank says they won't lend to you? Um, I believe that you do. You do, you do. And so from the seller's perspective they're taking a bit of a risk because they're allocating time like, OK, now that I've agreed to sell to, you know, Jane. Uh, if George comes along and says he wants to buy it, it's not available anymore because I'm relying on Jane. But if in 6 weeks Jane calls me up and says, I'm sorry, the bank won't lend to me, so I have to pull out, just send me my deposit back, well then the seller's in a bit of a bind. She can call George. George will say, oh, I wish I had known, but I just signed and I'm, I'm buying another place and maybe the market isn't as good as it was before and so on. So the cash buyer. Gives the seller the security that they don't have to worry about whether a bank will lend and this deal is going to happen. So for that reason contracts will look different contingency omitted or there will be a contingency and there is actually financial value and not needing it if you're that kind of lucky buyer. But in any event, this is the wrong form because we do need, we do need the mortgage contingency questions. All right, let's turn to the next one. Um Michael, uh, can you help us with the title search one Part D? Bob's lawyer does a title search in which a company searches public records to confirm that Susan actually is the owner of the property and that the town's building department has not found any building code violations. Sorry, let me turn on my mic. The search reveals that Susan does not have a permit for the shed next to the house. In light of the above violation, Bob still wants to buy the house, but he wants Susan to get this permit before closing. What remedy does the draft provide? What change, if any, would you suggest? Hint, focus on the main contracts, sections 6 and 10A. Section section 6 is title contingency. Uh, and 7 or 10A. Is Also about title, um, so what's the remedy in these provisions? Does it say if there's no permit and a permit is required, then seller has to get a permit? Does it say that? No, it doesn't. What does it say instead, um. So in the event one or both searches are not reasonably satisfactory, buyers, and this is the middle of 6A, now I'm kind of at the end of line 4, buyers shall have the right to terminate this agreement. So is that what Bob wants? No, he doesn't want the agreement to be terminated. He just wants the permit, so he's in basically compliance when he buys the house and he doesn't get in trouble. And so does the, the right to terminate the agreement doesn't actually give him what he wants and so. He could then say this, you know, the, the seller, sorry, I'm allowed to walk away. I'm going to unless you fix this, and she can say. You can say fine, see you. And then you say, no, really, I'm walking away. Good luck. You said you were gonna get a permit. I don't remember saying that exactly, but sorry, right? But I'm gonna walk away. Hey, there's the door. And so the point is you're kind of in a take it or leave it situation with the way the contract is drafted. You're not getting something you're legally entitled to, but you don't have the ability to force the other side to do it. So this is not the way the contract should be drafted. Very good. OK. And now the I think it's the last one. Tina, uh, can you help us with the last one, please? Uh.

SPEAKER 1
So, um, Bob wants to do a walkthrough the day before the closing to make sure all the work that Susan promised to do has in fact been done and there and that there are no new problems with the house. If he finds any issues, you want to delay the closing until Susan has addressed them. What does the draft provide? What change, if any, would you suggest?

SPEAKER 0
So let's start with section 17 of the 7. I'm sorry, section 7 of the main contract. Um, I don't know if you can see the header, but that's kind of all you need.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, it, it doesn't allow an ins inspection contingency for now. Right, so basically this is saying there's no right to

SPEAKER 0
inspect. Uh, you looked at it already, we're done, nothing else, so that's a problem. You can't, you can't have that in there. But then in addition. Um, there's a subtler problem in part 15 because basically, uh, Bob is gonna, gonna go and he's, let's, let's say we got him his inspection, he sees something he thinks is wrong, so section 15 is liability for delayed closing. So do you have a sense about what this provision does?

SPEAKER 1
Um. Is it like not encouraging a delay like good, they're

SPEAKER 0
trying to get this this provision tries to incentivize both parties to close on time. And so if it's late and it's your fault. Do they say please send a nice note and apologize, or is it worse than that?

SPEAKER 1
You have to pay something.

SPEAKER 0
There's a daily penalty for delaying the closing, and it applies to both the seller and the buyer depending upon who's responsible for the delay, uh, and so that could make a lot of sense, but do you see it? I don't know if you see the problem here.

SPEAKER 1
Um, I, I mean for this case it should be the seller's responsibility because it's If there's an inspection problem, then the sellers should be responsible for it, and it shouldn't be the buyer's respon responsible for so the penalty

SPEAKER 0
in and of itself isn't the problem. The question is, so if there's, if there's something wrong in the house and I, as buyer, think it should have been fixed and it's not fixed, then I don't want to close, but I certainly shouldn't be paying a penalty. If anything, she should be paying a penalty. And the language isn't entirely clear on what to do in that situation so this is the sort of thing where you'd wanna add language about that. Very good. Questions, comments? OK, so the basic argument of this class is that when you, you know, when you have a transaction, uh, there's an imbalance in information and there is a tool kit of things that people do to try to deal with it. And I said on the first day what's true of a used car is true of a house, so we've looked at the house. I also said it's true of the sale of a business, so that's where we're gonna go next. So let's please turn to discussion questions number 4. It's now panel 3. And let's think about how these themes play out in, um, an acquisition of a business. OK, so for that we'll start with part one. And so. Uh, Shelby. Can you get us started please by reading this language about Steve?

SPEAKER 3
Steve runs a company called Orange which makes computers, phones, and other consumer electronics products. Steve's goal is to distinguish the company by offering unique features and reliable, high quality products. He wants to make sure the company's products look, feel, and really are different. In addition to the hardware, he believes they need to have an operating system and other software that are different from what other companies use.

SPEAKER 0
And any resemblance to another electronics company named for a fruit is absolutely intended. All right, so, uh, let's start with part A.

SPEAKER 3
You are Steve's lawyer. He is considering forming a contract with the software developer, asking them to develop an innovative operating system. He asked you to draft a contract. You ask him to define what he's looking for and he says it has to be unique and innovative. You ask him to be more specific and he says it has to be really good, creative and different. What advice do you give him? Is the contract going to be effective in policing the quality standards Steve has in mind? What do you think? I think he's being really vague and I think as his attorney, I would try and let him know that like it's good to be different, but also boilerplate provisions exist for a reason and that they help to patch up a lot of the holes um ahead of time and so even if you want your products to be different, I don't think that a contract is a place to be experimental.

SPEAKER 0
I like that a contract is not a place to be experimental. I agree completely. I almost wanna put it on a bumper sticker, um, because you've hit the nail on the head in terms of what the problem is here. Um, he knows what he wants, but if it can't be reduced into something specific and objective, then the contract isn't gonna be terribly helpful to him. And it actually is gonna potentially give rise to unpleasant disputes about whether the work that was done. Should be compensated and all the rest, so um. You have a thought like it, it again, I, I don't know a lot about software. You may know a lot or a little, but like, do you think it's easy or hard to get more specific than this?

SPEAKER 3
I think it depends on like how new his software is too because if he's like the software market I guess is like very vast and you can have softwares of all different like all different types and so I mean if it is like adjacent to Apple, let's say then like you're gonna. You need to have things that might mirror their language, not necessarily in like the things that you offer, but just because like there's a certain way to do things depending on the industry. Right, right, so there are industry standards and there are

SPEAKER 0
probably things that can be specified with some detail, but I think um. For any of you who sort of know anything about the history of Apple or read a book about Steve Jobs as I as I have, he was, um, unusually good at and very obsessed with sort of differentiating Apple's products by giving them a particular look and feel and functionality, and it's, it's pretty great. I mean it's why the company was so successful, but I don't think it would be particularly easy to try to. You know, put into a contract much cooler than everyone else's products, right? Like it, it just wouldn't be easy to do. OK, so then we, uh, turn to our next question. Um, is it Brea or Bree? Bria, Brea, could you help us please with Part B? Sure. Aside from a contract, do software developers have other not legally enforceable reasons to want to impress Steve? Um, I would say that yes, I think that just in general as a business person, um, you wanna do good work and get contracts and make money. Um, you also wanna do good work so that you are potentially hired again. Um, especially if the company, you know, is gonna keep having long term success, absolutely. So, um, a repeat relationship makes a contract less important because the worst that happens from. Apple, I mean orange's perspective is, uh, they pay for some work they didn't think was good and they never use this vendor again, uh, and if that's the situation they can say to the vendor, look, we're just really disappointed if you want we'll pay you for this and it'll be the last check you ever get from us or you can redo it because here's some guidance about what we're looking for and so the idea is that repeat players can work things out. Andria, I think you also alluded to this, but in addition to the idea of working for Orange again, does the counterparty on this contract, the software developers from the outside, um, do they have other interests here in addition to just Orange? I would say yes. So is it possible that they might work with other companies too, right, and. Is a track record of. Satisfying these customers helpful in trying to get those customers, yes, because it helps them like build a reputation, right, right, so, um, there's both the repeat relationship with the particular counterparty and there's also the more general reputation which is valuable to you and so, and by the way for orange also if they're known. Uh, to, you know, renege on their promise to pay people because they make up unreasonable complaints and then they renegotiate, it's gonna be hard for them to get people to work with and just to make the point and perhaps an obvious way, um, so Bria, do you like to go to restaurants? I do. I do too. And so the last time you went, what language did you use with the restaurant to specify the level of quality that you were expecting in the meal? Did you bring the form along and they signed it, or how did you do that? I would say there was no form. It's probably an implicit understanding of quality. The idea, have you ever gone to a restaurant and been disappointed and not gone back? Yes, so again, like reputation is a very powerful factor in markets and so you don't need contracts for everything, but on the other hand, sometimes you do. So let's, um, let's move on to part C, um, but first, any questions or comments? Emmanuel, can you help us with Part C? Sure, um, if Steve can't rely on a contract or non-legal reasons to ensure that the software is innovative and high quality, what else can Steve do? Do you see a reason why the business of making software might be paired with another business so that the same owners own both? Um, well, in terms of what he can do, he could definitely hire someone else or he can make it himself. Make it himself is where I was going, right? So sometimes contracts are hard to draft because we can't really specify exactly what we want. And in that case it's great if we can depend on repeat relationships and uh reputation, but that doesn't always work and so as an alternative what we might decide to do is to broaden the scope of what we do in house and so this is known as the make or buy decision, the make or buy decision, and um there's a way in which buy is so much better, right? Because you can keep your payroll clean. You can only pay people to do things that you actually need and you can kind of pick and choose from all over the world to find the counterparty that can do exactly what you want at any given time and so I do think there is a kind of a market trend over many years now to try not to be so big that you do everything yourself but just to do the things that you kind of have to do and then find counterparties that will do other things for you. But that strategy doesn't always work and so um since we're about to talk about like what happens when you buy a business, what are the issues you face, um, how do you get past them? Well, there is that threshold question of why are we buying this business to begin with and sometimes the way to do make instead of buy is we, you know, hire people and build a division or a group ourselves. But sometimes we just hire that, you know, we just buy that business, right? And so that's not an unusual thing to do. And so Emmanuela, can you help us please with part D? Sure, um, what is vertical integration? What economic problems is it designed to solve? Have you heard the phrase make or buy decision? So vertical integration reduces cost, uh, through economies of scale. And so what a company can do is they can either make something or buy it, um, like we were just discussing, um. Yeah, yes, good, uh, good, and I That's perfect. That's exactly right. So the idea is sometimes there are incentive problems and information problems that make, uh, uh, sort of a contract type approach not workable and it's too hard to write what we wanna write. So instead you have companies that are buying other companies so that they're basically managing everything within the firm and vertical integration refers to the idea of. Sort of from the beginning to the end of the production cycle, you control everything. So. In the standard uh metaphor people use to distinguish horizontal integration from vertical integration, orange juice, right, so you're the company that sells the juice in the store horizontal integration would be we buy another company that sells the juice in the store and so you know that's what we do is we, you know, we market the juice to the supermarkets and we do it well and we're going to do more of it and that's horizontal by someone who does the same thing that you do. But with vertical integration, you say, OK, so I buy that orange juice in the store, but where did it start? Somebody owns trees and picks the fruit, and then there's the need to take the fruit and squeeze it and make the juice, and then you've got to package the juice and so on. And those are the different stages of production and vertical integration would mean that the same company that is selling. Putting the juice in the store is also growing the oranges, squeezing it, and all the rest. So this is vertical integration. You can have M&A that does either one, obviously, um, but at least the point that we've been talking about so far sort of implies vertical integration because you would normally say we'll just have a contract with the company that, um. That sells the fruit, um, but what if we feel like we can't specify the quality in a way that is meaningful to us, we might decide we have to grow it ourselves because we know how to get it to be really good and we can't depend on other people and the contracting, we couldn't specify it, there have been disputes and all the rest. OK. So, uh, a potential motivation for M&A and now we think about another one. OK Vanessa. Can you help us with part two? Assume that you.

SPEAKER 4
Yes Assume that Jim runs a law firm. He has 40 associates, but he has more work than they can do. Carla approaches Jim with the following idea. She runs an agency that can provide Jim with lawyers who take freelance assignments, which means they will come work temporarily for Jim. For example, for a day or a few hours to help with this specific assignment. They can help Jim draft a specific contract or motion or a will. Once they're done, they no longer work for Jim. Hey, what might Jim like about this idea? Um, I would say one thing would be it's very flexible, so Jim is only hiring the number of people, the number of lawyers, uh, that he needs at the moment, and, um, if business goes slower in the future he can hire less, I guess that's the main.

SPEAKER 0
And that is a big advantage is keeping that payroll flexible. You only pay people when you have the work and you need it and otherwise keep yourself nice and lean, so that would be. Uh, perhaps the best argument for doing this, uh, so. Uh, Yan, uh, can I ask for your help on Part B? Why might you hesitate to do this? We talked about what's potentially appealing, what might be potentially unappealing.

SPEAKER 5
Um, so one problem I can think about is that if he keeps like hiring outside people, he cannot like truly trust these people because like, those are, like you would like switch team back and forth. So they would build like long term trust between each other. Um, and also I think, Um, They, he might also have some information problem because he wouldn't know like how good the other team can do the work instead of like using his own people.

SPEAKER 0
Exactly. So there's a major problem here is he didn't. He doesn't know how effective they will be in doing the response, doing the assignments that he gives. And so back to you for a second. So in addition to the information problem, is there also an incentive problem?

SPEAKER 5
Um, yes, I think so because um. He and the people he hired, they don't have a long term commitment between each other and they don't have like an employment contract, like long term employment contract. So, um, it wouldn't give the employees that much incentive to do good work.

SPEAKER 0
I'm aware of the fact that if I don't do it so well, you might not give me that. You might even fire me and do it well you. Promotion, so I've got strong incentives to try to do as good a job. But if instead you bring me in just for the day and we'll never see each other again, I may not have quite the same. So this kind of structure has both potential information and. Issues associated with it, um, and so, but the good news is if the employee is a temporary employee, she does a bad job and it's bad for your client, you could just say that I'm sorry. It was the temporary, no, yeah, that's, that's not gonna work, right? So the point is, um, the stakes are high here because in terms of producing what the law firm needs to produce, the clients are expecting the same level of work and so, uh, what you have here is something that in principle could be great, right? Wow, we only hire people when we need them. That would be very efficient. But it's got a big, big set of information and incentive problems looming over it. And so just to finish this. What else could Jim do if she has too much work? What would be the alternative?

SPEAKER 5
He can just simply hire more employees, like more lawyers to do it.

SPEAKER 0
Exactly, just hire them full time as people. It does have these risks associated with it, but it also has the benefits of monitoring and incentives and so on. So this is another version of make or buy, right? The buy would be you've got this third party with lawyers and you can bring them in for the day and so we're not doing this in-house exactly. We're bringing in the extra talent when we need it. We won't, we don't, uh, and then make would be, no, let's, let's do this ourselves, which could be we're gonna hire more people. It could even be let's acquire another law firm and we'll just have another pool of talent that joins ours. But again, another illustration of why M&A might proceed because of the information and incentive problems that are hard to, hard to deal with, um, in just pure contract situations, so. Um, M&A can be a solution to incentive and information problems, but Lord knows it also has its own share of information and incentive problems, and so now we're gonna focus on that. OK. First, any questions? Motion. We seem to be operating under the assumption that when we make we're making a long term commitment and when we're contracting it's a short term commitment but it could be in reverse. I could hire somebody at will and they'll terminate them a week later if, if for whatever reason and I could also contract with an outside company on a 30 year or whatever, however long contract wouldn't that flip all of the arguments we've been making so far? I think that's. Is that there are particular parts that are. For particular types of cars and they're not really fungible, uh, and I don't know enough about this, so some of you. But I think the idea therefore is that. We'll have a series of independent companies that it has long-term contracts. And they actually. Tailor what they do to fit GM vehicles. They wouldn't work for Toyota. And then Toyota and Ford have their own sort of group of affiliated independent entities, so we shouldn't over and, and, you know, there's a way in which. Those companies could just be acquired, and there have been times when they were, and they get spun off and I. A professor I had years ago who said about investment bankers that uh they're very good at sort of saying. We need to buy this, you know, actually 2 years later, we really ought to spin that off, and each time they're getting a share, so. ambitious about everything. But on the other There are information and incentives. That can exist And they can be better and they can be worse and the right question, as you were saying is, well, how do we start? With this most effective All right, so other questions, comments? OK, so let's turn then to part. 3, I think. Uh, Sarah, Sarah here. Sarah, uh, yes, there you are, um. What is due diligence? What problem is it supposed to solve? Hint, it's a fundamental thing of this course. How does a buyer know that a seller is telling the truth when the seller provides information? Uh, it's meant to solve information asymmetry, and then I guess it's just the process by which the buyer and seller get information before they do a transaction. Uh, I would say the buyer doesn't know the seller's telling the truth. They can just hope. So basically this is a key remedy for the information problems that we've been describing. The seller knows things the buyer doesn't know. So the buyer has a sort of a formal process in which it can pose questions. Um, typically those questions. In writing, which is the way you try to increase the probability that they're true because you can demonstrate later if they weren't true in a way that is harder in a conversation, uh, and. So it, um, it is very much, uh, the job of more junior lawyers, so some of you may have been a part of this already. who end up prac Commercial setting you will spend non-trivial amounts of your time, especially early in your career. Um, how many of you have played the game Battleship? You know the game Battleship? So for those of you who don't know the game, it's two players, there's a wall in between. You have a grid in front of you and you put your ships on your side. Your opponent puts her ships on her side, and you're trying to guess where the ships are and the way you guess is the, the, each square is, is associated with a number and a letter, so you'll say A 8 and your opponent will say miss if there's no ship there, or your opponent will say hit if there is a ship there, and I can see you sort of saying, what is he talking about? About this game I haven't played in a long. I think due diligence is a lot like the beginning of the battle. find out Seller will typically want to send over. Hundreds of pages, sometimes certainly a lot, uh, uh, dense documents asking for representations. The representations basically are, this is true, this is true, you know, we are properly incorporated, we have killed fewer than 5 people in the last, you know, that, that kind of thing. And so the, the, the standard answer is yes, right? And if you get a yes, that's kind of like miss in Battleship. OK, glad we don't have to think about that anymore. We're moving. But if there's a represent. And the other side won't give. Or they're saying, yeah, no, we, we won't get it that way, but we're changing the language and here's what we'll do. Well, in my battleship metaphor, that's it, right? Oh, OK, there's something in that part of the board. Let's focus our attention there. So really, it's a system which allows the parties to sort of rule out massive areas that don't require a more detailed inquiry and then focus attention on areas that do. Uh, and typically it's lawyers that are coordinating all that, and often it's more junior lawyers who are working on it. And I have to admit that there are times when you sort of think what in the world am I doing here? I'm just sort of shipping paper back and forth electronically. This is very strange as a use of my time, but really what you're doing is you're helping the parties overcome these information problems which make it, you know, very difficult to value something, let alone to become convinced that you should buy it. So it's a very. The transaction and uh so we're gonna talk a bit more about it. Questions, comments. Good, OK. All right. Ellery, uh, can you help us with. Yeah. Due diligence and more fundamentally, the information a buyer wants can vary with the deal structure. Assume that a company called buyer wants to acquire a business called seller for cash. Buyer can either buy the assets of seller an asset deal, or buyer can buy the stock of seller seller a stock deal. As a logistical matter, what is the difference between an asset and a stock deal? What specifically is buyer buying in each case? Um, so. The difference, um. I mean, most obviously the difference is you're buying the assets of a company versus buying the stocks of a company. Um, and there's like tax and also liability implications because I think when you, um, By you know what, what you said is 100% right and the implications are what's important. But before we get there, just a quick formal step. So you're negotiating a deal, uh, your client is buying the business. We're gonna talk about what we need to buy the stock. What do we mean by the assets and let's assume that the business that you're buying is a corporation. So if you're buying stock, are you dealing, who are you dealing with exactly? Like as a legal matter, who's your counterparty? Who owns the stock? The shareholders, shareholders, right? So a stock deal is a deal with shareholders to buy their stock and you will end up owning. What if it's an asset deal? Who are you dealing with? Are you still dealing with the shareholders? No, no, you're not. Who owns the assets? Corporation, your counterparty is the corporation. So in an asset deal you're buying the assets of the corporation. In the stock field you're buying the stock that the the owners of the corporation, right, the stock, and so the key point is liability, which is where you were going. We'll pick that up on Monday. Um, I think we probably will. Sorry for unit, so it'd be great. Thanks everybody. See you on Monday. question about Uh How stuff is taxed differently.

SPEAKER 1
So like in the in in a class like a couple of classes ago we talked about how um Emma things. Um, the stock is gonna appreciate in value, so she puts some salary and stock instead and changes to tax

SPEAKER 0
rate and stuff. Yeah, we come back to me on that with venture capital. We just. I just want to say I was, I was caught off guard because I spoke last class and I was

SPEAKER 1
coming from an interview, so I was like, you look

SPEAKER 0
very so I was like, oh, I went last class. I was I'm not ready at all. That's what the high tone.

SPEAKER 1
Professor, I want 9:30. I'm so happy to be here. I I it's OK. I I have done.

SPEAKER 0
Uh, it reminds me, it reminds me of, it's all

SPEAKER 1
question and answer. It's very intuitive way to learn this.

SPEAKER 0
I was so embarrassed. I was like who cares? That's probably why I did what I'm reading. What type of houses. Hi professor, I had a question about the uh real estate of the deal. Um, so are there cases, um, how, how much, uh. Is a fire we allowed to. personal property, say, assuming that a house sells 4.01 million, which is in a higher mansion tax bracket than 1 million, right? And then say also the seller in the house there is a historic painting that is not so good, uh, but since it's so, so look, in most transactional settings and certainly didn't have that I think we got different facts. I mean like. I'm gonna say otherwise they're gonna I I ah, OK. You know, oh, OK, OK. Oh, take care. We're selling our house see you. Yeah, yeah. Bye bye. Over 50% x to move it to my next property. Maybe I don't really want to go to the.
