SPEAKER 0
Subaru Thank you, Bree. OK. Thanks so much. Hey, everybody. So sorry about the um weather-related cancellation on Monday, but hopefully you all had a good day. So today is our um our first effort to go through. This other theme in the class, which is regulatory arbitrage, but just to take a step back, last time we said the main theme in the class is that every transaction is likely to involve problems of asymmetric information. Buyers know less than sellers. This makes buyers suspicious. It makes them less inclined to buy things that they otherwise might want to buy. That suspicion is justified in principle, but it can also get in the way because it might cause people to make assumptions that are more pessimistic than the facts actually support so deals that would be good for both sides might not happen because of that asymmetric information. There are also incentive problems because in theory, uh, if you're a buyer and you don't really know enough. In an ideal world you'd say hey seller tell me this tell me that and if the seller always had to be perfectly truthful and to give you a complete unvarnished accurate account that would be a very straightforward way to address this information asymmetry but of course we know that the seller has incentives not to be entirely forthcoming. The buyer might have her own incentives to be a bit um. A bit strategic in the way she interacts. For example, if there's a contingent purchase price, as we said, and it's based on particular criteria, the buyer might be interested to influence those criteria to make the subsequent contingent payments smaller. So the point is, in any transactional setting. There's a likelihood of some combination of incentive and information problems that can impede what otherwise would be value maximizing transactions. And yet a lot of transactions actually occur when I said, is the, you know, is the message here that we should never buy anything again, that was really meant as a joke because of course we all buy things all the time. Our lives depend on it. It would be very difficult to be 100% self-sufficient for all of your needs. Who could possibly do that, who would want to do that. So transactions happen all the time and yet these issues are there so how do they get addressed? Well, I think particularly for the major ones which are the ones where the stakes are highest, um there are familiar. Tools in a toolkit that can help you and we talked about due diligence, we talked about contingent contingent purchase price, third parties vouching, uh, some other things too. And the idea is this is how the economy actually functions and one of the key points that I hope you can appreciate now is that lawyers are often at the heart of that effort and so lawyers are adding enormous value by helping to bridge these uh information and incentive problems and so over the course. of the semester we're going to look at very different transactional settings and you'll decide for yourself if it's true, but my view is that although these transactions vary enormously in their details, they can actually be really similar in the kinds of problems that come up as long as you know what to look for. And once you've identified the problem, which is more than half the battle, then there are different potential responses that might make sense depending on the circumstances. And so what distinguishes. A good lawyer from a not so good lawyer is being able to identify those issues. What distinguishes a really good lawyer from just a good lawyer is perhaps having a sense of which of the tools in the toolkit is especially well calibrated for the particular situation that we're in. And so over the course of this semester we'll be looking at different mechanisms and perhaps thinking about why some are used more in one setting as opposed to another. And that really is the major message of the course. The minor theme is that there's another way that transactional lawyers add value, and that is that although in theory legal systems should treat all similar situations similarly. Because that's the rational thing to do if it's a problem, if it looks like this, it should be a problem if it looks like that. If it's not a problem, don't worry about it. But the things over here that are all similar should be treated the same way. But the reality is there are limits to the ability of human beings to predict, limits to their ability to recognize similarities and how they might come up. Legal systems are creaky and slow moving. And so it is inevitable that similar situations will be treated differently across a range of settings, uh, and this is gonna be true in every jurisdiction and it's true in lots and lots of areas of law. The one I happen to know particularly well is the US tax law, so I will occasionally draw on that as um an example of this, and the point is that the way the transaction lawyer adds value on that issue is by steering clients in the direction of the, you know, lower cost, higher value type path that's available as opposed to doing almost the same thing but with very different and less favorable treatment. So we're going to introduce that second theme today. Um, and with apologies to some of you who've taken tax with me, you've seen this material versions of it before, but most of you haven't, and so I wanna be sure that we're all sort of up to the same, up on what's the metaphor, on the same page, we're all on the same page on this issue. Um, I do wanna be clear that this is not a class on tax law. You should feel free to take one with me. I would enjoy. Your presence there, but don't feel like the details of the doctrines are the point here because they're absolutely not. There's a a kind of a big picture, uh, that I'm hoping you will appreciate which is sort of about how tax planning works, broad strokes, and so that's what we're gonna turn to do. So let's please look at discussion questions number 2. This is panel 1 today, um, and before we do that, any questions or comments? OK, Danny, did I introduce you last time? Oh.

SPEAKER 1
Um, sent out an announcement on your TA for. Class to discuss here, um, the office hours once a week, 3 to 4 on Wednesdays. It's all in the announcement I think we're just gonna stay with the initial room that I put in there as well and uh if you can't be during that time or there's a better time that works for you, feel free to email me we can. That out, um. But I'm happy to answer any questions about material that we're covering in the class when we're closer to the exam we can talk. Um, or just like generally, uh. Questions, um, but I really enjoyed this class.

SPEAKER 0
Thank you Danny. All right, so let's get started with the first question. Cayetana, can I ask for your help, please? So, um. Economically similar arrangements are sometimes treated differently, as I was saying, this can happen because regulatory regimes are poorly drafted, not perfectly conceptualized, or require compromises to be administrable. Class uses US tax law as a recurring case study of this more general point. So could you now start reading as an illustrative example?

SPEAKER 2
As an illustrative example, assume that an employee works for Barbara boss. Assume also that the tax rate for each of them is 50% in order to keep the numbers round. The top federal rate for individuals in the US is actually 37%.

SPEAKER 0
Great. And now Part A.

SPEAKER 2
When Barbara pays Emma a salary of $100,000 does Emma pay tax on it? Uh, Emma does pay tax on the full $100,000. Yes, so salary income, very straightforward.

SPEAKER 0
It should be taxed. Part B.

SPEAKER 2
Someone who receives a gift is not taxed under US law, so Emma makes the following suggestion to Barbara. From now on, instead of paying me $100,000 in salary, why don't you pay me $80,000? And on my birthday you can give me a $20,000 gift. Would this reduce her tax bill? There is a special rules under US tax, US law treating gifts for employees as taxable, but please ignore this rule in answering the question. Uh, yes, Emma, this would reduce Emma's tax bill in theory, right?

SPEAKER 0
In theory it would because if she earns $100,000 50% tax, she keeps $50,000. If her salary is only $80,000 she'll pay $40,000 in tax, she'll keep $40,000 but then as to the $20,000 gift, the idea is, well, that's a gift, it shouldn't be taxed. So in addition. To the $400 after tax from the 80, she'll have this $20,000 gift that's a $60,000 after tax take home which obviously is more than the $50,000 and her tax is $40,000 instead of $50 so I hope you can all see that uh from her perspective this seems like an interesting possibility. So can you uh do one more part C.

SPEAKER 2
Do you agree with the following statement? When economically similar arrangements are treated differently, a change in the way the transaction is structured can yield dramatically better or worse treatment. Uh, I do agree with that statement.

SPEAKER 0
Great. OK. Lily. Can you help us with part two? So, uh, let's now view this situation from Barbara's perspective, since Emma is not the only one who might be affected here, can you start with A?

SPEAKER 3
Yes. Um, assume that Barbara brings in $300,000 in revenue for the work that she and Emma do together. Does Barbara pay tax on the entire $300,000? What does the term deduction mean? Can an employer deduct salary payments? So typically, they won't pay taxes on the entire $300,000 because that's probab that's revenue. So she'll deduct certain costs associated with the business.

SPEAKER 0
And that's exactly right. So the idea is the income tax system that the US has and many countries have is supposed to tax you really on your profit, not just on the amount of cash that's coming in. So if you have a business and you're getting 300,000 of cash, but you're spending $25,000 of it to earn that money. Then they won't tax you on the full 300, they'll let you subtract the costs of earning income, which in my example 250, and you just pay tax on the 50, right? So you just pay tax on the profit and the deduction is, is the term for letting you subtract the cost of earning the income so that you're only paying tax on the profit, um, so, um, can she deduct the salary payments that she makes? Would that be deductible? I think so. It is, yeah, yeah, no, quintessential deduction. So although the business is bringing in the $300 if she pays, uh, Emma, her employee, $100 her tax bill would be on $200 not $300. OK, so now Part C, can Barbara deduct the $10,000 gift.

SPEAKER 3
No, I don't think you can deduct gifts. That's just part of your income good and for now

SPEAKER 0
that should have been 20 my apologies, um, but gifts are not thought to be deductible and so because again you give your friend a birthday present that's a consumption item you don't get to deduct that and so on. So, um, let's turn then to part C. How, if at all, would Barbara be affected if she agrees to Emma's request to receive an $80,000 salary and a $20,000 gift instead of a $100,000 salary? Would Barbara have to change her own tax bill as a result?

SPEAKER 3
Yes, because, um, she can no longer deduct the full amount of salary she was paying her before.

SPEAKER 0
Good and so the same step that reduces Emma's. Taxable income by $20,000. Hey, it's a gift. It's not salary. I hope what you can see is it increases Barbara's taxable income by the same amount because now instead of paying what would have been deductible salary, she's paying a non-deductible. She's making a non-deductible gift. Does everybody see that? So you're basically saving Emma from paying tax on 20. $1000 but you're doing it by causing Barbara to pay tax on an extra $20,000. If their tax rates are the same 50%, then the tax you're saving for Emma, 50% of $20,000 or $10,000 is exactly the extra tax cost to Barbara, 50% of $20,000 or $10,000. Everybody see that? All right, very good. So Lily, the last one. Um, do you agree with the following statement? In deciding whether a tax strategy should be implemented, tax planners cannot focus on only one party to the transaction. Instead, they need to think about the tax implications for all parties. Yes, so that's what's illustrated here, and the point is you could. Think but not very carefully about this and say, hey, I've got a great idea we're gonna save Emma some taxes because she can get a gift instead of salary, but the problem with this is what every dollar of benefit to her is a dollar of cost to her counterparty in the transaction, which means this is not really gonna be a, a good, uh, tax planning, planning, uh, device, um, Alexander. So let's turn then to part E, assume that Barbara. Lives in another country which allows employers to deduct the cost of gifts to employees. Would this affect Barbara's willingness to accept Emma's proposal to earn only $80,000 in salary and to receive a $20,000 gift? Uh, no, in this country, Barbara owes the same 100K in taxes as before, so she's indifferent. Well, so I didn't write the question precisely enough with apologies if the country where she pays tax is a different country, not the United States, uh, so you know I think I think you understandably said well it doesn't matter where she lives, this is America, she's gonna pay tax, but let's assume. That um the the proper rules for her are actually her home country rules so in that case does it change her analysis about whether to accommodate Barbara? I think then it would, it would, it would, yeah, it would absolutely because when I said before, um. With the same 50% tax rate applying to both of them, this is not interesting anymore because every dollar you save for Emma is a dollar you're burdening. Uh, you're, you know, you're adding to the burden for Barbara. That's true only if they're both taxed the same way. But if instead what happens is in the employer's case, uh, in the boss's case, Barbara, if she's not gonna be subject to a 50% tax if you make it a gift instead of, instead of, uh, salary. Then there's no cost to her, right? And so this is why people look for arbitrages is the way tax lawyers usually describe it, you know, cross border arbitrages where the tax treatment of the same transaction is different for different parties because they're subject to different tax rules, right? So, um, what we've just done is we've changed the facts, uh, and so. Now Alexander back to you um wait let's see. So, uh, before we get to the next one, so the analysis is different now, right? The basic idea is because the same tax rules don't apply, um, we're good. One other question, let's say that Barbara. Is the head of a nonprofit. And nonprofits don't pay tax. Colombia doesn't pay tax, so it's the same country but it's a different kind of taxpayer. Um, would Barbara also be more open to the idea of saying sure we, we can make this a gift, we don't care. Um, you're, you're saying if Barbara was a nonprofit, yeah, she, she's the head of a nonprofit, but it's the nonprofit that, that owns this. Business and so you know the profit would be the nonprofits nonprofits don't pay tax then she wouldn't really mind same thing right? Same thing so it's not just a different country, it could be a different kind of taxpayer in the same jurisdiction. And the easiest one to see is a is a nonprofit, but there, you know, truth is the US tax system is wonderfully intricate and different types of entities are taxed in different ways even within the United States so you don't necessarily need an offshore. Partner, uh, in a tax planning transaction you just have to find the right domestic kind and this could work OK good so now Alexander, let's turn to, um, part F. so it's the same facts and, uh, Barbara is not a US taxpayer, um, so. What if Barbara suggested an $80,000 salary and then not a $20,000 gift, but a $15,000 gift? Would Emma prefer that to a $100,000 salary? Um, and why would Barbara prefer this? Um, I have that Emma would prefer the new scenario. Um, because she pays less in taxes, and then Barbara might prefer this scenario if. Um. Well, I'm not sure. No, no, you, you got it. You, you're right. Still better, right? So from Emma's perspective this is not as good as a $20,000 gift. Who wouldn't rather get $20,000 tax free instead of $15,000 tax free? But our comparison is not that it's um this gift situation with one where she would just get the salary. And if it's a $100,000 salary, she's keeping $50 as we've established because of the 50% tax rate. In this situation, it's an $80,000 salary, so she'll pay $40,000 in tax, she'll keep $40,000. And then she gets a gift of 15, not 20, which would have given her 60, but the 15 puts her at 55. And so here's the really challenging math question for the day is 55 greater or lesser than 50? It is it is greater, right? So she's still doing better. Emma is still doing better. And what about Barbara? Is this better or worse for Barbara, assuming she's not a US taxpayer and she can deduct all of it anyway. Um, This would be worse for Barbara or better. Better, yes, this, this is better, and the point is because wouldn't you rather pay someone 95 instead of 100? And yes you can still deduct deduct all of it which saves you 50%, but by going from 100 to 95 you save $5000 you keep 100% of that savings, not just 50% of the sort of after tax amount. So the point is this is a better deal for Barbara. She's getting something out of it. And it's still better for Emma than the old deal if not as good as Emma's proposal um, Alexander, do you think maybe what's going on here is that Barbara sees the tax benefit and is basically saying sure I'll go along but let's split the tax benefits so I get something too? Yeah, yeah, that's really what's going on here and that is not an unusual situation um so last one for you, do you agree with the following statement when parties to a transaction can restructure it to generate more favorable tax treatment for one of the parties they're likely to share the tax benefit. So even if only one of the parties can claim the benefit, they're likely to adjust the pre-tax cash flows to share this benefit with others whose cooperation is needed to generate the tax benefit. Yes, so that's just a summary of the points that we've been making questions, comments. Great, OK. Uh, Nikki So let's turn to part three exclusion valuation and so the point of where we're going now is to say there are different kinds of tax planning. They all sort of share a common feature. At at the bottom, but uh they can look a little different and so we're gonna look at at one planning discussed in questions one and two takes advantage of exclusions. Taxpayers strive to improve their economic situation in ways that are not included in gross income, uh, for tax purposes. So a gift, you know what was so good about this? She's getting money. Money is money, but if you call money a gift instead of salary, changes the tax treatment. Salary is something you pay tax on. A gift is something that if not for a special rule for employees you wouldn't pay tax on special rule is exactly because of this situation so the idea is one way that taxpayers try to engage in tax planning, but fundamentally it's all the same similar situation treated differently cash from your employer called a gift is one thing cash from your employer called salary is another. So taking advantage of this idea of an exclusion. So planners also take advantage of opportunities to understate the value of what a taxpayer has received, effectively excluding a portion of it. So can you please read part A for us? Continuing with the saga of Emma, assume she works for ABC Co and her salary is $100,000. Emma needs a car and a new one costs $40,000. If Emma asks ABC to cut her salary to $60,000 and to buy her a $40,000 new car, do you think her tax treatment changes? In other words, if someone is paid with goods or services instead of cash, are they taxed on the value of the goods and services? What do you think? Um, I don't think so. I feel like your answer. Yes, perfect, very wise of you, very wise, yeah, I know, so the idea is if I said to the dean, you keep paying me in cash, I'm paying tax on it. I like gold bullion instead, would you just give me that doesn't change the tax treatment, um, and it gets more interesting. Uh, if for example, I owe Danny some money and I say to the dean, don't pay me, just pay Danny directly and hopefully I don't pay tax on it, well, if I act on that, you guys will come visit me in federal prison because I absolutely pay tax on it if it's an amount paid on my behalf but not to me. It's taxed, so, um, the simple idea of saying let's change the, um, salary from cash to a car, that doesn't work, but let's go on part B. Um, Emma reads an article which says that new cars lose 20% of their value. Um, as soon as they're driven off the lot because they become used cars, so their quality becomes more suspect, so Emma changes the request in, please pay me $60,000 in cash and a car, but instead of letting me pick it up from the dealer, ABC should buy it, keep it for a week without using it, and then give it to me. What is Emma's goal in making, um, the suggestion? Um, she's probably just trying to lower the value of the car. Exactly right. And what's the benefit to her in lowering the value? Um, it would help her with her taxes, right, because what she's gonna say is, um, yes, uh, it was a $40,000 car when the company bought it, but that's not relevant to me because when I got it it was worth only $30,000 so my salary is not. 100,000 anymore it's the 60, in cash plus the 30 of the car, not 40, and so the argument is my salary is 90 now um and of course the great thing from her perspective is it's the same car she was gonna buy. Does it really matter that somebody else drove it off the lot? Kept it in a parking lot for a week without using it and then she got it, you know, probably doesn't matter at all, right? So that would be the argument and that's what she's trying to do. Let's take a look at part C. Um, Let's consider the effect on ABC if the car is worth $30,000 when they transfer to Emma, how much is their compensation deduction? Um, I think it's still $30,000. It's still $300. So has their deduction from compensation become smaller? Um. Because they were gonna pay her $40 in cash and now they're giving her a car that's worth 30, so did they lose part of their deduction? Yes, yes, they did, right? They lost 10,000 of their deduction, um, the very same benefit to her, hey, save me $10,000 on my taxes, we'll call my salary 90, um, is a, is a, is a cost to them. They're losing $10,000 of compensation, but one more thing to think about Part D. Is there an additional deduction that ABC might claim here? Did they lose money on the car? Um. I mean yeah if they paid $40,000 and then now it's worth $30,000 right, because so they paid $40,000 for it when they're transferring it to uh the employee in exchange for the employee's work it's worth only $30. The way the tax system would view that is, well, they sold the car to her for the fair market value of her work that's $30 and if you sell something for $30 that you bought for $40 did you make her lose money? You lost money, lost $10,000 and happily the tax system lets you deduct that if it's a business expense, not, not if you know I bought a car and then sold it to Danny and it's just my personal vehicle. Like no, you don't get a deduction for that, but you do if you're a business that bought a car and lost money on it and sold it, which means that although the business's compensation deduction is only $300 there's another $10,000 deduction that they can add on to that. So congratulations, you are the tax director of um this company and people have come to you and said, can we do this? Is this gonna hurt our tax position if we accommodate her? Um, putting aside the fact that the government might not like it, which is important and I'll come back to that in a second, putting that aside. Have you protected the full $100,000 deduction? Yes, yes, you have. And have we also reduced her compensation from 100 to 90 for tax purposes? Yes, but from her perspective, does it still feel like 100? I think so because it's the car she was gonna buy so this is the sort of thing that can work very well um with that caveat that the government isn't going to like it and there's a whole substance over form analysis that the government can do and would probably do here to say she told you what car to buy. There was just an understanding that you'd park it in a parking lot for a week, but no, we're not, you know, we're we're not accepting this. This was her car from the beginning, $40,000 compensation, this $10,000 loss, you just rigged that and then you'd possibly litigate with them now. Um, could you be smart enough to structure it in a way that they couldn't really attack it? Yes, I'm pretty sure that you could. Uh, it would be a bit more elaborate than this, but anyway, this is meant to just give you the flavor. We're looking for ways in which, um, economically it feels the same to people, but the tax system would classify it differently. So that taxes are lower and when we look at whether taxes are lower, we have to do two things we don't look at only one party to the transaction, just the employee. We have to look at both. We have to look at the employer as well. Questions. OK, so Nikki, thank you. Um, aha. Can you help us please? We're now turning to conversion. So this is a different kind of tax strategy. Um, we convert, so the tax system classifies income different ways and some are more favorable than others. So can you read part A for us in the US.

SPEAKER 4
Um, so in the US there are two types of income, one is ordinary income, which includes salary income, the maximum rate is 37% under current law. The other is capital gain, which is generally a taxpayer's profit from an investment. Um, the minimum rate for capital gain is 23.8%, 0 sorry, maximum, um, which income would a taxpayer usually rather receive? Um, capital gain because yeah, it's lower than that.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, capital gain, lower rate, rather have that than ordinary income. OK, Part B. Emma from the questions above thinks the stock of ABC Co is going to appreciate in value. She spends $10,000 of her salary to buy stock, uh, 100 shares, $100 per share. The stock does appreciate to $15,000 so she sells it for a $5000 profit. Is that profit from an investment taxed as capital gain, the lower rate, or ordinary income, the higher rate?

SPEAKER 4
Um, I think capital gain, yeah, yeah, so the standard

SPEAKER 0
way that you get capital gain is you make an investment, you hold it for more than a year, and then you get this reduced rate. OK, so now Part C.

SPEAKER 4
OK, so instead of receiving cash and using it to buy stock, Emma asked ABC to reduce her cash salary by 100 and to give her 100 shares of ABC. Um, ABC agrees, but with a condition, Emma keeps the stock only if she continues to work for the company for 12 months. After 12 months, the stock is worth 150, how is the stock taxed?

SPEAKER 0
hint, hint, when employees receive stock or other property subject

SPEAKER 4
to vesting, that is, they don't keep it unless they satisfy the condition, which is often about staying in their jobs. They don't pay tax until the property vests and then they pass pay tax based on its value at the time it vests.

SPEAKER 0
So what's her situation here? She got $90,000 this year. Um, she also got stock this year, but it doesn't vest. She's not entitled to keep it until a year and a day, right? A year and a day from now, and a year and a day from now, which we'll call next year, uh, it's worth 15. So, let's start with the easy $90,000 in cash now, ordinary income or capital gain?

SPEAKER 4
If it's now then ordinary, yeah, so just typical cash

SPEAKER 0
salary taxes ordinary income rates, nothing complicated about that. But here's the part that's a little tricky. So you're getting stock worth $10,000 now, but you're not legally entitled to keep it. You become entitled to keep it in a year and a day when it's worth $15,000. So do you think we're paying tax now or next year? Next year, next year is the default. We're gonna turn to an election in a minute, but the, the standard rule, if you don't do anything is no tax this year, you'll pay tax next year. Um, how much? Like what's, what's your income next year? Is it 10 or 15? I think 15, so it's worth 15, so that's your tax bill, um, is it still ordinary income because you know if she bought stock and it goes up in value, isn't that capital gain or is this ordinary income?

SPEAKER 4
I think since she waited a year it would be capital gain, you would think.

SPEAKER 0
Um, but no, basically from the tax system's perspective this wasn't your investment yet because it wasn't yours yet. It, it, it was your salary and you're taxed on what it was worth when you got it and by got it the tax system means when you're legally entitled to keep it. So under the default rule, the, the basic rule if you don't make an election is ordinary income of $15,000 next year, right? Because next year is when the tax system thinks you really got it and in the same way that I can't tell the dean to pay me in gold bullion dollars instead of cash and expect that my tax treatment will change, um, she got property instead of cash. But you're taxed on the fair market value of the property, so that's the, the basic rule, um, and so. Let's see. Uh, so what we've done is we have a change, um, from just getting cash and she buys it herself to, uh, getting it from the company and getting it next year. Did her tax bill increase or go down? Decrease, so I guess in the first year it went down, but the increase in the second year more than offset it. So my answer is it, it went up because basically she's paying tax not just on the $10,000 value, um, this year, but on the $5000 of appreciation that still counts as salary, that appreciation, whereas if she bought it as her own investment and then sold it later it would have been a lower tax because it would have been capital gain. But I don't know if I said that at all clearly. Do people follow that or? Any questions on that? OK good so now we're gonna change the facts because the tax system offers an election so Francis, um, your help please. US tax law offers someone in Emma's position a choice. If she receives property subject to a vesting requirement as Emma did here, she can make what's called an 83B election which allows her to pay tax on the value of the property when she receives it, not when it vests. Any gain or loss after that is treated as capital gain or loss. So now, uh, so just to take a step back, we are going through this tax rule partly because it illustrates the general point. Similar things can be taxed differently and it's good to know which one you want and which is better. Um, we're also going through it because when we get to. Venture capital in a couple of weeks we're gonna be sort of focusing on this rule, especially it turns out to be very important in venture capital, so you will see this again. OK, so if Emma Francis, if Emma expects the stock to increase in value from 100 to 150 per share, is it a good idea to make the 83B election? Um, and if so, is this a conversion strategy? I would say if she's confident in her prediction of where the stock price is going, then she should probably make the 83B election. Excellent. So um I agree with that and, and you're absolutely right to have included that caveat at the beginning if you're quite confident that you're gonna have appreciation in the stock. Um, then what you can do is you can turn that appreciation from ordinary income, which it would be if you have to wait until vesting to pay your ordinary income tax on salary, um, you can turn it into capital gain taxed at a lower rate. Uh, now if it goes down, you'll be sad because you paid ordinary income tax and then have a capital loss which is less good. Um, but in situations where you're quite confident or maybe even in the venture capital context where like you pretty much know for certain that that's, that will happen, um, then this is a very good thing to do. Uh, people understand this, make, makes sense. OK, Francis, one last thing, an employer deducts the same amount that an employee includes. So, what is the employee, the ABC deduction um without the 83b election, like in the last question, and how does it change, if at all, if she makes the 83b election? So in the scenario where she doesn't make the 83b election, uh, it would be a deduction of 105. So, um, based on like the 15, we'll just focus on the 15 of stock because there's, there's always gonna be a 90,000 deduction for the cash salary payment and the question is what do we do with the stock that you get and it's worth 10 and then it when it vests it's worth 15. So in a situation where she doesn't do the election. As to the stock, what's their deduction gonna be 10 or 15? Uh, it would be 15. It'll be 15. And if she does make the 83b election, is it 10 or is it 15? So it would be at the time when she received it, so it would be 100, 10, right? So interestingly, under the 83B election, um, it affects the employer too, right? The employee can say tax me on this value today when I get it because I think it's gonna go up. And that limits the deduction that the employer gets to that amount and if the employee is right and there's a lot of appreciation, she'll get that as capital gain the employer will not get to deduct it so what's good for the employee has a bit of a cost to the employer, um, and it's the employee who makes the decision. Um, again, we're gonna, we're gonna see 83B elections again in just a couple of weeks. OK, questions on that? And the, the bigger picture point is this notion of conversion here we're not saying it, it is taxable income or it isn't like salary is gift isn't. Either way you're paying tax, but the rate will depend on the way the tax system classifies something. Is this an investment in which case you get capital gain, or is it payment for services, in which case it's ordinary income and the interesting thing in this situation is it is an investment that is payment for services you could kind of shade it one way or the other, so the tax system says there the default is payment for services and we'll tax you on the fair market value later when it invests and if there's an investment return there we just treat it as salary. But they give the the employer, I'm sorry, the employee the opportunity to to change it and say, you know what? I'm filing this form which basically says tax me a salary on what it was worth when I got it even though I'm not legally entitled to keep it. And assuming I do keep it, then I can sell it later and it's capital gain or loss, depending on what happens. OK, so we have this exclusion idea, we have conversion as a second type of tax planning. Any questions or comments? Please Like, so if Emma doesn't simply receive stock as

SPEAKER 5
a part of her compensation. But she, she, when she received in a circumstances where she received all cash, but she uses a part of the cash to reinvest into the company to buy the stock at a discount under the company's incentive plan. Um, so she, so she's buying something that's worth, worth more than the cash she's paying. In this circumstances, is, is that, that gain taxed as capital gain or ordinary income?

SPEAKER 0
Um, so the, the discount would be ordinary income. Um, because it's value that's available to her because she works there as compensation for services, if the discount was more generally available to early investors, uh, whether they're employees or not, then she wouldn't be taxed because that would just be viewed as a, you know, if I go to the store, I mean. It's actually a a pretty simple analogy um imagine that Columbia owned its bookstore which it doesn't I think but imagine it did and uh the rule was um if you bought this book. And you're a Columbia employee, you pay 20% less than list price, but everybody else pays less price. That employee discount is in principle taxable. There are some special rules where it wouldn't be necessarily, but, but in principle that would be taxable. But if the Columbia Bookstore says, OK, all books 20% off for everyone today, generally available discount, nobody's taxable on that. So, good question. OK, um, let's turn, uh, any other questions? OK, so let's turn then to our next variety of tax planning, which is deferral, has to do with timing. And so, uh, Ming Xin. Uh, this is Part D. Another type of tax planning defers the tax, delays the tax. Let's consider why deferral is valuable and how it is achieved. So can you read Part A for us?

SPEAKER 6
Uh, assume that your neighbor needs uh 100 to pay a bill. She is expecting a 10K payment to come in one year, but until then, she will be short of money. You, on the other hand, have 10K in hand, and she asks to borrow the money from you. What concerns, if, uh, if any, might you have in making this loan? Um, well, I would consider how likely it is that the neighbor will pay me back in a year. Um, will I have the need for the 100 in the near future, and, um, will the neighbor be willing to pay me back with some interest?

SPEAKER 0
Perfect. So the idea is it costs you something. To make this loan and there are two types of costs and you uh properly identified both one is so called credit risk. It might not be paid back so I'm taking a risk by lending this money and the other is even if I'm sure to be paid back in a year, what if I need the money sooner, sort of a liquidity type risk so both are there, uh, and so. Um, given that in the state, so we've, we've sort of covered part two, you might think that you don't need the money, but is it possible that conditions will change? So that's the, the liquidity risk. So let's turn to part three. If you make this loan, will you do it for free?

SPEAKER 6
Preferably not, but if I, if it's a dear friend or family, you don't know this person, right?

SPEAKER 0
OK, great, yeah, yeah, right, and, and yes, of course we do favors for friends, and those favors can have financial value, so that's certainly true, but in a commercial setting you don't lend money for free because of these two costs the credit risk and the liquidity issue for yourself, so. We generally think that if we give someone the use of money they'll pay us and the other side of that coin is if we get the use of someone else's money we would usually expect to have to pay for that, which brings us to Part B. In general, why do taxpayers prefer to pay a tax next year instead of this year, assuming the relevant tax rate doesn't change.

SPEAKER 6
Uh, because there is some time value in money.

SPEAKER 0
Right, because in this example we are the neighbor who wants the money and the government is us and what we're able to do is we're able to get the use of the money ideally without paying interest for it and so the ability to delay your tax is like getting a loan from the government it would have been their money now but they're letting you keep it longer. And if they're not charging you interest for delaying the payment of tax, which is usually, you know, what we're talking about, then you're getting an interest free loan from the government. But what we've just said is, you know, interest free loans, that's not commercially sensible, uh, thing to do. Um, you might do it for a friend, but, and maybe. For some of you, the government thinks of you as a friend. I don't think they may. I'm not sure they have that view of me, not confident enough to want to just lend them money and so on, but I'm happy to take the, oh, OK, I'm gonna stop talking. I, someone maybe these words may come back to haunt me. Um, but the basic point is that tax deferral is a way to reduce the value that you owe the government, the value that you're giving the government, because it really functions as an interest-free loan which is commercially, um, quite a valuable thing. So, uh, Yasir, Yassir, yeah, hi, so, um. Let's turn to part C. You anticipate having to pay a $10,000 bill in one year. For simplicity's sake, assume that your marginal rate is 50% and quite unrealistically that the interest rates are 10%. You decide to invest money today in order to fund this $10,000 obligation in one year. Do you need to invest $10,000 today or more or less? Are you gonna invest more? More to invest more. Less less, right? Because the idea is, and, and just to prove it, let's take a look at part two. I need $10,000 in a year. I can earn 10% on it, then I might, then I'll pay tax of 50%, which is kind of like um I'm really earning 5% on it. So if I invest 9,524. Um, my pre-tax return would be 10% of that. Um, what's 10% of that? Uh, 952. Perfect, right? So $952 pre-tax, but then we're gonna have to pay, uh, some tax on that, uh, and the point is after taxes if we add that to the 9524. Might it actually be $10,000? No, yes, yes, so, so the idea is you can put aside less than $10,000 if you have time for the $10,000 to grow, uh, and I think many of you are familiar with the concept. So if I say what is the. Present value of $10,000 assuming a discount rate of 5%, the answer if I did the math right, which isn't guaranteed, but the answer is 9524, right? So the obligation that you have of paying $10,000 next year doesn't feel like $10,000 now. It feels like less. It feels like only $9,524. So, um, if the bill is a tax bill. Putting it off means it feels like a smaller tax bill, OK, people see that? All right, um, so Yasir, one other, um, let's say the obligation is not to pay next year but to pay in two years instead of in one year. That means we have more time for the money to grow and let's assume the interest rate is the same. Could we maybe set aside less than 9524? Yeah. Right, we could, we could, so the more time, the more the delay, the longer the deferral, the better it gets, right? The cheaper it feels to us, the more we can delay that payment and so the present value at a 5% discount rate for 2 years, we're down, as it says on the next page, to $9070 and if you can turn a $10,000 tax bill into a $9000 tax bill economically. That's pretty good. And basically at this interest rate, that's what delaying it two years would mean. So, uh, OK, I said 11, we'll just do one more for you, yes, you're doing a good job. Do you agree with the following statement? Deferring a tax reduces its present value. Different actually reduces its present value, so I would say yes, yes, yes, exactly, perfect, um, so gee, could I ask you to help with the next one which is part E. Is tax deferral more or less powerful as the deferral period grows? In other words, from the taxpayer's perspective, is deferring a tax for 2 years better or worse than deferring it for 1 year, assuming the nominal amount of the tax doesn't change? I think it would be more powerful. Exactly, so more is better, delay it, delay it more, delay it 2 years, delay it 5 years, it just gets better. The same problem as above, but now interest rates are lower. They're 2% instead of 10%. So after paying the 50% tax on your interest income, how much will you have in one year if you set aside $9,901 today? It's around like $10,000 right? This will get you to $10,000 right? And notice that's a lot more than the 9524 we had before. So if the idea is, hey, I, I have to pay a $10,000 tax, I can delay it for a year, I've just reduced. The the burden of the tax to me, it now feels like X instead of 10,000. Well, X has become 9900 instead of 9500 because interest rates are lower, so tax deferral is less valuable when interest rates are low, more valuable when interest rates are high, so the two variables that determine. The appeal of tax deferral, and it's always good, but sometimes it's really good is how long and what are interest rates. Longer is better, higher interest rates are also better. Um, and again, you know, the present value of 10,000, assuming a discount rate in one year, that's the 9901. Um, is tax deferral more or less powerful as interest rates rise? More powerful, more powerful. OK, so, gee, let's turn then to this example of Fran, Part I. Fran is an independent contractor who's doing some freelance editing for George. As a so-called cash method taxpayer, what cash method means is that Fran owes tax on income only after she actually receives it. She has to get the check in the mail or, you know, Venmo has to hit her account. Uh, she has to receive the money in order to be taxed on it. She's worked quite a number of hours and is going to receive a significant payment. In late November, Fran mentions to you that she's about to send an invoice for this payment. What tax advice can you offer about the timing of when she should send this invoice? I would advise her to delay sending the invoice until very like late December, or like even until the last year. So the payment is actually received in January of the last year. Right, very good. Now, uh, so the idea is we can delay our tax by a year if we delay the payment by a month and a couple of days. And obviously delaying the payment by a month and a couple of days, it costs you something because you don't get the interest that you would have earned by having it that extra month, but on the other hand it saves you the tax not for a month but for a year so on balance it's likely to be worth it and so this is actually a standard thing for any of you who are ever sort of in this position. Delay the invoice, right? There's no need to send it on December 1st January 1st is a very good day on which to send an invoice, uh, from your perspective because it defers the income into the next tax year. Questions? Yes, please.

SPEAKER 7
and So sorry, since deferral benefits the taxpayer, is there any benefit given by the government for paying taxes in advance?

SPEAKER 0
I think we need to make you the Secretary of the Treasury. Um, because, generally there isn't, and you could imagine it being in the government's interest to do that, um, but it's such an interesting question that I will, I will provide a nugget that may not be of interest to everyone and it's certainly beyond the scope of this class, but, um, you've probably heard of sort of 401k retirement accounts and many of you probably have these retirement accounts, IRAs, so there are two versions of them. With one of them Um, you get a deduction when you put the money in, and then when you retire, in your case, many decades from now, you pay tax on the way out. That delays the government's tax bill for a long time. Another version is the so-called Roth IRA, which means you pay your tax now. And then when you take the money out later you don't pay any tax and for reasons that I will not go into now on certain assumptions the tax bill will be the same to you in present value terms um but the Roth has given various advantages and starting this year, you know, one of the things that Congress did in July is um there are certain kinds of retirement savings that have to be Roth now can't be, um, deductible. And so why is that? Well, the cynics among us, and I'm quite sure we're right, uh, we understand that Congress knows that with the Roth they get their money now. And with the deductible IRA they won't get it until people retire, so there are times when Congress is focused on getting money now as opposed to later and even is willing to kind of give up value later. For the sake of getting the money now, which is a little bit like do they ever reward you for paying taxes now? It's not so much that they're rewarding us in this situation as they're requiring it, um, but, uh, one last point on that is who's heard of the scoring window, the 10 year scoring window. OK, Farhan has doesn't surprise me. Um, do you wanna tell people what it is? OK, all right. So basically what it means is when Congress does budget policy they really only have to count the effects for the next 10 years, so this means that it's sort of in Congress's interest to push sort of tax savings back out of the 10 year window and to have like. New taxes within the 10 year window because then they can present themselves as much more responsible about budget balancing and it is a widely hated practice among tax commentators who think the government's time horizon is obviously longer than that and there's some manipulation that goes on because of it. So thank you for the question. Um, OK. Uh, good. So let's see, we're now we turn to another type of tax planning, and it's called shifting. Um, and so grace. Uh, can you help us with shifting, please? And this is part 6. Another type of tax planning shifts income from one taxpayer to another, so Diane is an investment banker whose marginal income is taxed at a 37% rate. Diane's son Eric is a high school teacher whose marginal income is taxed in the 22% bracket. Diane owns a portfolio of bonds. She pays $10,000 of interest each year. She wants to use this money to help Eric. What is her after-tax income from these bonds? Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, maybe 63 if I, if my, yes, the, the basic answer is, is yes. So because her tax bill is 37%, what she can give is not the full 10,000, but you know, 10,000 minus 3700 of taxes. But now let's look at the next variation. Instead of giving Eric her after-tax interest on the bonds, she's thinking about giving him the bonds when he receives the $10,000,000 interest payment, how much tax would Eric pay?

SPEAKER 8
He would have to pay 2200.

SPEAKER 0
Excellent, so because he's in the 22% bracket, he pays less in tax than his mother would pay. Um, so now part C. Either way, Diane, the mother, is dedicating the return from this bond portfolio to her son Eric. Which of these alternatives reduces their combined tax liability and gets Eric the most money?

SPEAKER 8
Definitely giving it to Eric because he has a lower um. He's in the lower bracket.

SPEAKER 0
Exactly right, 100% right. So are you suggesting that it might be a tax planning strategy to think about the fact that taxpayers have different tax rates that they pay? And do we try to shift the income to the people in the high bracket or the low bracket? The low bracket, the low bracket, right? So this is shifting shifting means it's still gonna be income, so it's not like the exclusion idea we had. Before, let's make it a gift and it, you know, it won't be taxed. No, this will be taxed. The interest income is definitely taxable, but who's paying the tax, right? And in a world where everybody had exactly the same tax rate, there would be no shifting. But the point of shifting is that people don't have the same tax rates and so one version of planning is you try to shift income to the lower tax recipient. Um, last question for you. We've seen a tax reason for the mother to give the son not the interest but the bonds, the whole portfolio. Are there reasons having nothing to do with tax? Why Diane might hesitate to adopt this tax planning strategy?

SPEAKER 8
Um, yes, because she'll no longer have legal ownership over the bonds and so let's say she expected Eric to pay her back. There's no like. Legal ownership over that so if he decides to sell it, then she can't really do anything about that, right,

SPEAKER 0
right so once it's gone it's gone um if it's a matter of giving him the interest every year, could she decide not to? In other words, if she, Eric, I gave you the interest last year, does it mean she has to give him the interest next year? No, no, right? And uh, but once she's given him the bonds, can she control whether he gets the interest next year? No, no, so she's giving up control now. The thing about. Things that are done within a family is that in some situations you don't care, right? Like it's all in the family and we're just looking to save taxes and so it might be that in this situation she'd be delighted to give him the bonds because the whole point was to help him financially but on the other hand you might know families where things are not quite that uncomplicated. And it may well be that before she makes the gift she says, now Eric, I just want you to tell me what have you been doing lately? How have you been using your time? Have you been, you know, coming to see me every week and, and are you working and right and so this may also be something that she wants to do is to influence him a bit. She'd be giving up the influence if she turns the bonds over. So, um, it's not uncommon for people to be completely unwilling to do something like this even if it would reduce their tax bill, uh, so it does depend on the family dynamic and the specific facts so thank you very much. Questions, comments. OK, so, um, Hallie. Great, let's turn to multinationals because we're still talking about shifting, but this is a different setting, but it actually turns out to be the same point. So there's a parent company, um, it's a US company and it sells phones to US consumers charging $500 per phone. The phones cost $100 to manufacture and another $100 in marketing and distribution costs netting a $300 profit. So that's our basic fact pattern. Now absent any tax planning, the $300 would be taxed currently in the United States. Um, how much tax does parent have to pay, assuming the US corporate rate is, which it is 21%, so 21% of $300. Yeah, so the tax per phone would be $63 right, $63 tax. OK, but now this is a multinational that has some savvy when it comes to tax planning. Um, Part B, parent incorporates a wholly owned subsidiary in Ireland, uh, called Irish Sub. The corporate tax in Ireland is 12.5%. It might increase to 15%. There's. Signals that that might happen we'll see, um, but for now let's say 12.5 is the parent better off shifting income to the Irish sub? Yes. Yes, right, because basically the tax rate is lower, so the amount of tax that you'd have to pay is lower if it is Ireland and not the United States that is taxing this amount, um, so in theory the company would like to be earning its income in Irish sub, not in US parent, uh, and yet they still want to sell the phones in the United States. So how could you do that? OK, that brings us to Part C. Parent borrows money from the Irish sub and pays $100 of deductible interest per phone uh to Irishub. How much taxable income does Irish parent, I'm sorry, how much taxable income does the parent have now, uh, in the US per phone? We had $300 per phone before. Is it still $300? No, it's 200 $200 right, because basically there's this expense in that Irish sub, it drives a really hard bargain when it comes to interest rates, even though you know you own 100% of it and can tell it what to do. But let's put that to one side. So the point is you're now paying interest, uh, you're deducting it within the United States to generate income that's taxed at a lower rate in Ireland. So we're now down to $200 instead of $300. Um, by how much has the parent reduced its overall tax bill per phone? That would be $8.5 per phone. I think that's right. It's the difference between 21 and 12.5%, so we're saving $850 per phone now in tax, um, OK, and the assumption here is that the US doesn't tax Irish subs income and that the tax would be triggered, uh, only with conditions that aren't gonna happen. Um, and the truth is, uh, under the US tax system in general you're not gonna be taxing the things that happen overseas. There are lots of exceptions to that. This is all very much oversimplified, but the exceptions and those rules are designed to try to make this more difficult, but this is the thing they're targeting, so this is why I want you to see how it works. Next one. When Parent developed the current version of its phones, it included a number of technological innovations which are patented. Although the engineers developing these innovations work in California, they work for Irisub, which is responsible for coordinating parents' research. Assume that parent starts paying a $150 royalty to Irisub for each phone that it sells in the US and assume that parent is also paying the interest that's still happening. How much taxable income does parent now have in the US and how much taxable income per phone does the Irish sub have? So the taxable income in the US would be 50 per phone. Um, and in Ireland it would be $250. Very good. So we had $300 per phone. Now $100 of it is getting shifted through an interest payment. $150 is being shifted through a royalty, which means $250 of the $300 is being taxed in Ireland, and now only 50% of that original um $300 is being taxed in the US, um, OK. So, uh, this is the, you know, and this is not, uh, meant to be fictional or hypothetical. This is the way Apple, for example, structures things, and there is something I think a bit especially not intuitive about the fact that you can have people developing a technology working in California. And it's gonna be used in the United States, but the intellectual property is somehow owned in Ireland and if you said oh that's interesting like what's happening in Ireland, the answer is, well we have a corporation in Ireland and then you say OK and and what happens there? And the answer is it's a corporation. And, and the people who do this work, are they in Ireland? No, right? And so you know under US law that's generally not dispositive it's sort of more about like the actual legal ownership resides in a corporate holding company in a jurisdiction and so, um, so again there are some anti-abuse rules that try to make this sort of shifting more difficult but this is, um, very central to the debates about international tax and it's. Basically a version of shifting. So, um, you should understand what shifting means and how it works. And so, um, last one. How did changes in the US corporate tax rate affect multinationals' incentive to engage in this shifting? For example, the corporate rate used to be 35% and Congress reduced it to 21% back in 2017. Do you think that the change reduced or increased the incentive of multinationals to shift income? Yeah, so the 2017 change would reduce the incentive of multinationals to shift because of the lower tax rate. Good. So the narrower the gap between the US rate and the rate of another jurisdiction where income might be shifted, the narrower it is, the less incentive there is to shift. And since shifting has costs and there is some inconvenience involved and you have to pay. Someone like me to figure out the way to do it so that it works and all the rest, it does help to have a tax rate that's not completely out of whack with the rest of the world's tax rate, which is why, um, I, before the 2017 change was sort of, uh, annoyingly insistent every panel that I had the opportunity to speak on about like we have to lower the corporate tax rate. I remember a, a sort of a prominent, um. Tax lawyer on a panel with me saying well you know why, why do we have to lower it? I mean it's not like anybody pays it anyway and I said exactly right like because because my objection just without thundering on too long wasn't that the tax was too low in and of itself it's that you're creating weird incentives where actually US companies were almost invited. To have either economic activity or the way they conceived of their economic activity is happening anywhere but the United States and it's a strange tax system which discourages economic activity in the home jurisdiction. Um, you know, there's sort of a tradition of trying to favor, uh, economic activity in the home jurisdiction, and there are reasons to worry that that may not be a good idea, arguably it is. I mean we could talk about that, but it's hard to make the case for discouraging it in your jurisdiction, which is what we had, but without really having intended it. So I think that 21% rate makes this less exciting, but it's still done because. Is 21 greater or less than 12.5? It's, you know, it's still, it's still more, so there's still some gain, but it's significantly less. OK, so we've talked about. Um, exclusion and valuation, we've talked about conversion and we've talked now about shifting, so we've covered the different kinds of tax planning. We just have a couple of minutes left in our hour, um, Sophia. So can you help us, please? Thank you with frictions, our next topic because we've talked about what in theory you can do, but people don't always do the things that in theory they could do and so in analyzing whether tax planning is effective. We have to consider non-tax costs, non-tax costs associated with the planning strategy which economists call frictions. If those costs exceed the tax savings, the taxpayer will not pursue the strategy. So let's start with A. Um, recall the example of Fran, the independent contractor. What non-tax and so her situation was, hey, wait until January to send your bill. I know you could send it in November, but wait until January, you can delay, uh, having to pay your tax, um. What non-tax cost might cause her to say no, I'm not going to wait. I'm going to do it now. So one could be liquidity needs, so she might need

SPEAKER 9
the money herself. I also thought about business relationship concerns that it could seem unprofessional if she delays it for too long and the risk of nonpayment because the longer she waits for the invoice, the longer that the greater the chances that maybe she won't get repaid.

SPEAKER 0
All good, all good reasons, and I'll take the first one and highlight it especially. If the alternative um is like yes I can wait and I can save some money in tax but I'm gonna have to borrow on my credit card and pay a shockingly high interest rate then it would not be rational because the interest costs for that month might actually be higher than the you know time value savings from. Um, from, from delaying your tax, so, uh, another way to think about frictions is the goal is never to minimize tax. It's not minimizing tax per se, it's maximizing after tax return. How will you do in terms of all of your goals and all of your costs including tax and so you know tax minimization and maximizing after tax return they might sound the same but they're not the same because after maximizing after tax return takes into account the other uh non-tax goals and I had a mentor many years ago who would like to make the point by saying the easiest way to pay no tax is. To make no money And nobody is ever gonna pay you for that tax advice, right? So tax minimization, I earn nothing. I'm starving like oh good for you, uh, no, right? We're trying to maximize after tax return. OK, um, Xiaozu, uh, so the next question is about Diane. So recall the example of Diane who's deciding whether to give the bond portfolio to her son Eric. What is the most tax efficient step for her to take? Uh, just give the portfolio to Eric. Exactly, just give him the bonds, but why might she not do it? Because she doesn't want to lose control of the bond. My son is a bum. I don't trust him, not doing it. That's a friction, right? That's a non-tax cost. OK, so we have one minute to go. Um, all right, uh, one more hau, uh, recall the multinational that manufactures phones. Under current law, parents, engineers can live in California and parent can still shift the value to Ireland where it's taxed at a lower rate. What if the US Congress changed the law requiring the engineers to work in Ireland in order for profits from their work to be taxed in Ireland? Might that matter? Uh, engineers may don't want to work there. They don't want to move from California to other places, right? So look, Ireland is a beautiful place, so maybe they would still wanna go, but on the other hand, if people have family and other ties to a location and you basically say to, I don't know, Apple just to pick a company at random, um, your whole workforce is gonna have to move to another country in order for you to continue to get these tax benefits. Well, if they lose 30% of their people that might be a cost they don't wanna pay and they'd rather just pay the extra tax or not um, great, so we're pretty much done with this we have just a little bit more to do on Monday, but mostly on Monday we'll start the next unit which I think is MNA so looking forward, wait, what day is today? Today is. Well, yeah, right, so Monday. Good. I, I wasn't wrong. See you all on Monday. Thank you.

SPEAKER 5
That I was when I saw that 21% maximum on tax and 2323.8%. I was thinking whether this has something to do with private equity setting up. Like back in standard practice, I know. And I, I just thought that was a standard practice, but I don't know whether this has something to do.

SPEAKER 0
Not necessarily, but, um, come back to me on that after we've talked about venture capital if there are some

SPEAKER 5
definite similarities. Thank you.

SPEAKER 0
Thank you. Good. No problem.

SPEAKER 5
I didn't want to miss it though, so, uh, I just, I just, I was just looking over the notes for last class and um we talked about your interview. So I have another class, so let me, I see very quickly my bad I've got two people waiting. OK, I'll do one for you. I, my, my, my question was um. these issues. on I'm saying. We trying to spot these issues like symmetry or like due diligence agency it's gonna look a lot like the um. Discuss some questions that we have. I see we will, we will talk a lot about

SPEAKER 0
what will be on the exam. OK, thank you, thank you, sure, of course, hey, good to see you. So would you resend it to my assistant and me because what she was supposed to do, but I think she did it only for one person or another. She's gonna use my auto signature to get it done. I got it. uh, and you copy me and say I asked you to do it and please use the auto. She can do it later. I don't because I don't have the link. I can special study office I you the link and you can. OK. Oh, now, are we talking about the registrations because that went through. I, I, I looked yesterday and it went through. So I think we're gonna check on it, but I

SPEAKER 5
think it's.

SPEAKER 0
Good. Sure.

SPEAKER 5
Hi, I hope you still remembering this last semester. I look for the next class. I was wondering, can you share the feedback for the exam. That one. If you, if you email me, we, I, I think

SPEAKER 0
I have the exams in my office and we can, we can do that. So yeah, sure, you can just email me. Good to see you, sure.
