Is. Thank you for that. Oh girl, I unlocking new characters every day. I How would you tell?

So good to see everybody. Last time we were continuing our discussion of acquisitions, mergers and acquisitions, we were talking about the incentive and. Information problems that people encounter and we were especially focused on due diligence and uh the point is that there are versions of due diligence in situations in the world where it's a very cooperative process if the seller has really only good news to to to to share and. Positive facts to offer, then they have a real incentive to try to provide as much of that information as efficiently as possible because they have every reason to think that that information will increase the valuation that they get in selling the business. The more complicated dynamic arises, not surprisingly, when there's also bad news, when there are things they'd rather the buyer didn't focus on. And so in theory you could imagine and this is a very human reaction people saying well let's try to give them only the good stuff and not the bad stuff but you can't lie if you do the deal can be undone because the representations were false and all the rest um you can actually remain silent on some issues and so that's what we were focusing on is what about this choice to say uh that's a question that I'm not going to answer. Well, the point is that the buyer is going to interpret that probably in a very cynical and concerned way thinking, well, the reason they won't answer it is that the answer is not going to make me happy. I'm going to be concerned about whatever they would have shared and so actually that must be bad news. So a refusal to answer equals bad news and without knowing how bad people are likely to think. Very bad, right? and so this then creates a dynamic at least for sophisticated sellers where they will want to share bad news because they know that if they don't, people will assume it's bad and then. May well assume the worst and so if it's not actually the worst it's bad but not terrible it's actually in your interest to share it because you avoid the risk that people will discount the price to account for terrible instead of just unfortunate. So that alone creates the possibility of a cooperative process where both the seller and the buyer want the seller to have full information so that the seller can make an informed judgment and won't make assumptions that will be adverse to the interests of the seller. Uh, the other aspect of this is in the same spirit when information needs to be shared and the seller can do it more efficiently because they have access to the information, they may also be more inclined to share this information, uh, and, and to, to do it the, the cheap way, right? And we have the example of let's let our law firm write up a memo for you it'll cost much less than your people getting up to speed and so on. And so then the theory would be the price would get adjusted, the seller wouldn't really bear this cost, but the seller can do it more efficiently, so it's like the seller is being deputized by the buyer to gather the information in the most efficient way. So this is the most cooperative idyllic version of due diligence. Uh, what I, what we discussed last time is it does not always play out and the difficulty with this theory. Is that it's true that buyers will draw negative inferences from sellers' refusal to do things and refusal to share things, but not always because what if there's a neutral reason, a completely different reason having nothing to do with the quality of the information if you're, you're in a situation where the seller can explain why they won't share this information. In a way that is plausible, then the buyer doesn't know whether this is an effort to hide embarrassing and bad facts or it really is just what the seller said and we gave the example of sellers that don't wanna give away proprietary information and this is plausible you're a small pharma startup with an interesting idea and your nightmare is that you provide access to to to. Uh, you know, provide access about a new drug that you're creating, hoping that the big pharma company will buy you and instead they decide not to buy you but to steal what they saw and to do it on their own. And so that can be a justification for saying I know you want more information about what we're doing. I wish I could provide it because I think you'd be very impressed by it, but my fear is that if I provide it. Then you're not gonna buy us and in 6 months we're gonna find out that you're doing what we're doing and we won't have been paid at all and you'll basically steal it from us, so sorry we can't do that. So when you have this situation of multiple explanations for a refusal to disclose, it does become a challenge, right? It does become a challenge and what I hope you can see is we now have the fusion of an information problem. The seller knows more than the buyer with incentive problems. The seller doesn't want to disclose bad information. That's one incentive. The seller doesn't want the buyer to steal good information. That's a competing incentive problem. And so incentive problems can get in the way of solving an information disparity. This can all end up in a place where the deal just dies. The deal might die because the buyer doesn't know the reason this information won't be shared. They'll be cautious they'll be conservative about it, but maybe it really was just that they don't want the information stolen. Maybe it really is a great product and so on. So what do you do, right? Uh, the good lawyer doesn't give up. They try to think of mechanisms to deal with the incentive problem. And if a reasonable one is proposed and the buyer says no, I'm sorry, the seller says no, and another reasonable one is proposed and the buyer still says no, it's not like the seller can uh the buyer, sorry, I keep getting my parties mixed up, it's not like this the the buyer can know with 100% confidence that they're hiding something, but it does become increasingly likely. Uh, and we use the example of, OK, so we'll sign a contract saying we can't use what we see and we won't pursue an idea like this for at least 12 months and so. That might have been enough and the fact that the seller says no I'm not satisfied might mean that they're hiding something and then you come back with still another idea as we said you choose any. Medical expert at another institution that you want you can pick that person will answer specific questions from us you can review the answers we're not trying to steal anything, but we really wanna know this about what you're doing. If the seller still says no, they're either the most cautious paranoid company you've ever encountered or they are hiding something and this is an excuse, but the point is you don't have to leave it in that equilibrium where you just don't know. You can do different things to try to find out judging their reaction as a way to get a sense of what's going on. OK, so we've been looking at this dynamic, uh, we were about to finish our discussion of due diligence with a fact pattern about why it's important, and that is discussion questions number 4, Question 11, uh, so let's turn to that in a second, but first, does anybody have any questions or comments about anything we've been doing so far? Please go ahead. Yeah, um, hi professor, I think we haven't, um, addressed the question number 5C of the, uh, discussion, question 3, right, sorry, thank you for reminding me, um, and, uh, you said is, is it 5C? 5CF discussion questions 30, discussion questions 3, which I didn't bring with me. Do you mind, uh, even though I asked you to remind me, so thank you, do you mind reading that question for everybody so that we can just cover that one because I skipped it in class the other day? OK, um, so it's about the Susan's. Uh, Susan's sale of the property to Bob. So before the closing, there's some damage to the housing of the storm. Susan knows that the damage is her responsibility, but she has moved away and is not in a position to supervise the repairs herself. She also realized that Bob will want the opportunity to do it his way. She offers to give Bob a $2000 credit. The purchase price will be the same, she says, but we will treat the amount you will pay your contractors as part of the purchase price. Bob mentions this to you and say we should do it differently as a way to reduce your taxes. What is the better alternative? Thank you. So this is going back to our real estate purchase and the idea was that um there's an issue and so the the seller is gonna cover the cost. But the way she proposes to cover the cost is to keep the purchase price the same and just to apply an amount as a credit towards the purchase price, and that's not as good as an economically identical thing that they could do and so does anybody want to suggest what instead they might do? So the better thing to do is to reduce the purchase price by that amount, and the reason a lower purchase price is better is that both the mansion tax, if it applies, and also the annual property tax will key off of the purchase price. So if in fact the buyer is not paying. The full amount but is paying $10,000 less reduce the purchase price by that amount because that reduces the base for the tax. There'll be 3% of that amount and it'll increase over time, but there, there's 3% of that amount that you're gonna pay in property taxes, so 3% of $2000 is not a huge amount of money, but it's still something. And so the principle is. All else being equal, accommodate an issue like this by reducing the purchase price instead of by keeping it the same and just counting some of it as paid. People see that. Good, thank you for the reminder. All right, any other questions? OK, let's turn then to um. Question number 11. And so Jeremy. Uh, can you help, uh, do you mind, I know it's a little bit long, but do you mind reading, uh, those paragraphs about the seller? Oh, yeah, a seller, a startup company is developing a new type of bus which is supposed to be more fuel efficient. Seller has developed a design and has made a few of the new buses in order to test them, but has not yet begun delivering buses to customers. New York City has ordered 10,000 of these buses, but no buses have been delivered yet. Bayer is a big company that makes buses and wants the New York City contract. Seller has begun testing the buses and has discovered a problem with the wheels, which may be expensive to fix. Seller has not yet finished testing the buses. The agreement has the following language. Buyer has made a lengthy, detailed, and independent investigation regarding the design and specifications of the new bus, and seller has not finished testing the new bus. The agreement also says that seller shall continue to give buyer access to inspect the new bus and that neither party is relying upon any warranty or representation of the other not fully set forth in this agreement. The agreement does not have any other representations about possible defects in the bus or about the test seller has been conducting. Um, after the deal closes and buyer discovers the defect in the new bus, buyer sues, claiming that seller should have told buyer about the defect. Um, if you are the judge and you have to decide the case based only on the contract language quoted above, who do you think should win? Um, so what do you think? I mean, I think, um, it was on the buyer to ask about it. The buyer never asked. And so because buyers said that they weren't relying on any other representations or besides what was, um, being represented here, then the seller should win. All right, uh, fair enough. So this is actually based on an actual case if the company was called Grumman. They made buses for New York City for many, many years, and then New York City offered the contract to this small little startup company and Grumman didn't like that very much, so they decided to buy the startup company so that they could continue to supply buses to New York City and so the contractual language. That I'm quoting here actually comes from the case and in a couple of minutes I'm gonna ask you guys to vote as if you're the judge to decide who should win should the seller win here should the buyer win and so Jeremy it sounds like at least based on the language you're kind of leaning towards the um you know the seller winning this case the buyer should have asked they didn't ask and so on. So let's move to the next question. If you decide that the seller wins, which is your inclination, aren't you rewarding sneakiness? Um, I mean, well, yeah, I can't agreed. You, uh, you are, so let's then turn to part C. If you decide that the buyer wins, aren't you rewarding or at least excusing carelessness? Uh yeah, I mean I think that's where I was coming from, right, that, um, you know. It's, I think this is kind of like an inform information forcing rule where you know if you're a careful buyer then you should be affirmatively asking for um for everything. Good, good, which brings us to the next question and then I'll ask everyone what they think and to weigh in. So information forcing, so that suggests that there should have been more done here. So is there language that the buyer should have asked for in order to avoid this problem? Um, I mean, I think they could ask for something like, you know, to the best of the seller's knowledge, um. Um, there aren't any problems with the design, um. Like to the extent that they've been testing I guess good so in principle the buyer could have insisted on a rep from the seller that basically says yes the bus does work right like that's the kind of thing that you could have seen and it wasn't in the contract so just inviting other comments you're the judge you're trying to decide who wins this case should it be the buyer should it be the seller, um, what do people think? For those of you who aren't, yeah, go ahead, please.

SPEAKER 3
I guess I agree with the initial inclination back there. It seems like the language is pretty clear that it kind of put the onus on the buyer to see if there was a problem, um, and it said that neither party was relying upon any warranty or representation of the other not set forth in the agreement. So even if maybe there could have been some like verbal, yeah, we think the bus has no problem, just based on sort of the letter of the contract, I think the. It, the, the seller probably should win.

SPEAKER 0
OK, others, other views? Yes, please.

SPEAKER 1
I, I just think the buyer was really careless in the writing of this contract. They're a big company. They really should have known better than this, so I wouldn't reward them by a cop out because the language is just that bad.

SPEAKER 0
You guys are tough. So let me ask a different question. uh, some of you are from jurisdictions other than the United States trained in those systems and so I'm not asking what you personally think I'm now asking who would win in your jurisdiction. Does your jurisdiction, for example, have something like a duty of good faith? I will answer on behalf of the people who are not in the room um so in much of the world the the seller would clearly um lose here because even though it's not in the contract there is this idea of a duty of good faith in which, uh, if you haven't been asked you're supposed to volunteer you're supposed to say something this is clearly a misleading situation the sellers knew they hadn't been asked the important question. And you're supposed to give that information and so what you then have is you have the corporate law of the jurisdiction and or the contract law of the jurisdiction sort of filling in terms that aren't actually in the contract that's maybe a way to think about it so that the way our tough people have answered uh is certainly consistent with the idea that it's all about the contract but in some jurisdictions it isn't only about the contract. And so for those now just returning. To the uh In the US, does anybody remember from contracts any doctrines that might be relevant here? Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, I was gonna bring this up, but in contracts we had, uh, Henningson versus Bloomfield Motors, which, um, pretty famous case on implied warranty of merchantability, and so I was wondering if that would be relevant here at all. Exactly, it's that kind of doctrine that could cause a court to come out in favor of the buyer letting them off the hook and so on, um, any other, anything else? Anybody? Yes, please. There's also the doctrine of unconscionability, um, so this is especially relevant in cases where the two parties have a power imbalance, um, or there's some other kind of hidden concealed, um, differences in, uh, power, yeah. No, that's exactly right and so unconscionability is, is very similar to this, uh, duty of good faith. Uh, and that would be the US version of, of, uh, that doctrine because we do have unconscionability in the US. So is, is, so let me go back to you, um, you're the judge, you know about the doctrine of unconscionability, um, Grumman, the buyer has brought a lawsuit based on unconscionability here and so what's your thought about that? I think you have to look at all the external factors and like the conversations that took place before, during and after contracting, um, the size of the parties, um, whether or not they've done this before. Absolutely, um, and all of that works in favor of this lawsuit or against the lawsuit here. It would work in favor of the buyer. If there were to be found that there was a power, but I mean just, you know, you've got two companies here, I guess the point is maybe you don't know enough about the companies from the problem, right? Fair enough. OK, yes. Um, So just to answer that question, um, so in

SPEAKER 4
our class, I think we learned that unconscionability requires two prongs, which is substantive and procedural unconscionability. So based on that perhaps this was, you know, substantively unconscionable, but maybe it wasn't procedurally unconscionable because there was no, uh. There was no hidden clause that was written in like 6 point fonts or or or or or something along those lines. And there was no real mismatch of bargaining power either.

SPEAKER 0
Good, thank you. Um, OK, so now let's, let's, let's vote in a second. I'm sorry, I see more comments. Please go ahead. I think also, given that both parties are expected to be sophisticated businesses, whatever that might mean, I don't think there is the power imbalance that was spoken about before. I think one of the cases was like a brother that happened to be a businessman, and then a sister that was selling her house and it ended up being worth more than she thought. And they kind of spoke about how like given that she relied on the intelligence of her brother that she was being taken advantage of. But I think in this situation, both businesses are expected to be sophisticated and thus have the information to defend themselves. Excellent. Good, good. And yeah, go ahead. I mean, one other question I had just quickly was about not finishing their investigation. I mean, is that any time that they found an issue they would just say, OK, we're finishing our investigation and we're not our inspection and we're not inspecting anymore. Like, is that fraud, like maybe fraud invitiating all as well, or is that just good, good. So this whole idea of we haven't finished yet, like at some level I haven't finished anything until I die. And so if that was the spirit of the I haven't finished yet because maybe we'll find a way in which it's not a problem even though it sure looks like a problem I guess you could potentially try to lean more on the reps being misleading in some ways so that's that's a nice point. All right, so you're gonna get two choices and so I ask you to vote um, the first option is, uh, the deal was done and stays done, uh, the seller. Uh, was entitled to, you know, do it this way, no relief for the buyer. Um, the deal is done. The deal is the deal, and then the second alternative would be no, um, the seller misled, behaved badly, didn't comply with the duty of good faith, violated unconscionability for whatever reason, um, the seller misbehaved, the buyer was tricked, and we're gonna undo the deal. The deal is over, dissolved, OK, so. Um, basically in my first version, um. Seller wins and in my second version buyer wins, so who votes for the seller who thinks the seller should win? OK. That is a large group. OK, who thinks the buyer, I'm sorry, uh, who thinks, yeah, who thinks the buyer should win, who thinks the deal should get undone, and OK, so we've got a hearty band of you, right? Not, not a, not a tiny number. OK, so, uh, basically this is, uh, a case which tells you a lot about the state of New York and maybe US law we're tough here. So the court dismissed the case basically along the lines that uh Jeremy started with which is just the contract says what it says and I think it was very important to the court that these were both sophisticated parties as you said which is why uh unconscionability was not thought to apply and we don't have the procedural elements of it and so on um and you know the truth is the seller was a smaller company than the buyer. And I think really what happened here is the buyer got they were arrogant and they sort of figured we know what we're doing we're not sure you know what you're doing but yeah we don't really need to ask you very much and we know how to do our own due diligence and so basically the court said things along the lines of it's not my place to fix your mistake um you need to. Do your own deal the right way and courts don't exist here as sort of an insurance policy for people who made mistakes and there actually is a kind of an incentive aspect to that which I wanna ask you about um but I should say that I do think um this case would have come out differently. In other jurisdictions, not so much in the US because I think the sort of a deal is a deal kind of idea looms large here at least for sophisticated parties, but in other jurisdictions where there is an implied duty of good faith and it's taken more seriously, uh, then probably it would have come out the other way. So a question for anyone who wants to volunteer. You are asked by a friend from another jurisdiction who's puzzled at the coldheartedness of US law and this seems like you're just rewarding sneakiness and you know what about these poor people who messed up and this is really embarrassing and it's a shame and it's just not right and we shouldn't let it happen um is there an answer that you could give them along the lines of the law has to be this way because otherwise. Is there, yes, go ahead, please.

SPEAKER 4
Um, I think for me two things come to mind. The first would be What we've been talking about in class a lot, which would be creating the correct incentives, um, we want people to be more thorough in contracting and then I guess another one that comes to mind would be trying to prevent paternalism in the law, which isn't quite the theme of this uh class, but I thought that was also perhaps relevant to parties are contracting. So, um, who are we to tell what is right, what is wrong?

SPEAKER 0
Good, no, absolutely, uh, please go ahead.

SPEAKER 5
Similar to what that was said before, I'm, I'm thinking of the Holmes and Bad man and that at the end of the day contract law is a strict liability regime and everything that's written in the contract and was signed off should be implemented and especially for like a New York case, the four corners of the contract rule because the contract specifically established or stipulated that like uh certain representations, they should be read as written.

SPEAKER 0
Very good, good, others. Yes. I just don't want judges to read it. Right. Good, yes, no, I think I think that is part of it and let me give a fact pattern which may uh accentuate this a little bit, uh, and so Ellery maybe I can bother you with this so it turns out that you, uh, just inherited an apartment, uh, from a distant relative and it's come to you and it wasn't maintained well at all and so I approach you and I say I'll buy it. Uh, and you say, look, inspect it all you want. I just want you to know like I'm not standing behind anything here in terms of quality, uh, and I say sure, no problem. Do you imagine that the price we set might reflect what you just said? Um, yeah, I think the price would probably be lower because if you're gonna have to come in and do a bunch of renovations or just find issues that you didn't expect, um, then you're probably not gonna want to buy it for as much money because you're gonna have to put money in later. And let's just make up numbers and say this would be worth 3X in good condition. But it's in bad condition, so I'm only paying you 2x, not 3x, but 2x, so you know, a third off a 33% discount. OK, so we do this, we have some sort of contract that reads a little bit like this where it says that I've done my investigations and buyer has made a lengthy detailed and independent investigation. Uh, and, uh, seller is not giving any warranties and all that, just a lot like there's some people sort of call it an as is contract like I'm buying it as is without assurances from you. So we do that. I pay you my 2x, take over the apartment. I find all kinds of things that are wrong with it and so I go to court and I say Ellery has violated the duty of good faith because there are all these things that are wrong with it and it's actually gonna cost me X to fix this so Ellery, give me X. So I'm sure you're thrilled, right? I'm sure you're very happy with this, but imagine that I succeed in that lawsuit and now in the spirit of Harry Potter and the Time Turner and you can go back in time but you know what's gonna happen you're still gonna do this deal with me, right? You'll still be very comfortable with the idea of taking a discount on the price knowing that uh you've sort of been clear that you're not standing behind anything even though a court is gonna come in and make you stand behind it anyway but you're fine you'll do it anyway, right? No, no, no way, right? So does this idea of an as is transaction where one side is explicitly saying. I'm not saying it's great it is what it is. Let's adjust the price. Can that kind of transaction happen as easily, maybe even at all in uh a jurisdiction where the judge is gonna come in and rewrite Farhan's contract, uh, particularly on this issue, reading in a duty of good faith that you actually didn't intend to have there. So I think I, I think that was too long a question, but I'll answer it for myself and say I hope you can see that with uh uh uh these sort of implied duties written in there are certain contracts that will never be signed. There are certain deals that won't happen, but in the fact pattern that Ellery and I were discussing, it actually is in both of our interests like I'm in theory fine. With paying a discount and fixing it up myself, you've been very clear that the quality isn't great and that this is on me and and it's sort of in our interest both of us to do it this way, but this is a form of paternalism at least inadvertently where the court is saying no Ellery and David, you can't strike that deal because the seller has to provide at least a minimum level of quality. OK, so that would be a a sort of an incentive based defense of the US approach which can certainly seem tough and coldhearted, but on the other hand what it does is it maximizes the freedom to enter into contracts that are maybe a bit unconventional. On the other hand, to the extent that Ellery is, and she is by the way, very smart and I may not be, then it may not be so great, right? Like she's taking advantage of me and this is why we do have unconscionability, but you kind of look for imbalances and. In sophistication as a trigger for that and I think it would be very difficult to make the argument that Big Grumman was unsophisticated and doing a deal with the smaller startup which I think is very much why the case came out the way it did. Questions, comments. OK, so let's turn then we're continuing with our discussion of M&A, but now we're looking at uh a different aspect of it and particularly to start, um, material adverse change clauses, and this is really the situation that something changes midway, uh, within the deal, um, basically within, you know, you you can sign. Uh, on the dotted line and say I'm going to buy, you're going to sell, but there's a period of time in between. And so the question then becomes. Uh, what you know what happens if something changes during that time, and there is this clause that appears in a lot of transactions which basically says that if there's a material adverse change. Defined in a very specific way we don't have to do this deal anymore and it's a bit counterintuitive and frankly it's even a little bit different from the whole hey uh tough luck approach that we were just describing in the in that bus case so we kind of wanna understand. When, if ever, uh, parties can get out of deals so before we get to the so-called MA clauses, there are other clauses that are potentially relevant and as you saw I draw on, um, some things that actually happened during the COVID pandemic as, uh, a way to understand how these deals may play out because these are actually things that that did happen, um, and so this is panel one again I think right? panel one. Um, so. Uh, Yusuf Uh, can I ask for your help, please? Part one about Anne, can you read that one for us? Discussion question 5. Yes, yes, so it starts Anne owned a shopping mall. That's not the first. Oh, I'm looking at the wrong discussion questions. That's 6. OK, start with 1. And I do apologize. Uh, and I, I know I've confused things, but the confusion was mine, not yours, so just start with the very first question. Yes, please. Good, so what is the difference between a rep, uh, a covenant, and a condition? Uh, just say, and is your mic on? I'm having a little trouble hearing you. Sorry. Yeah, so, uh, a covenant is, uh, a party's promise to perform or not to perform. Good. And uh warranties, uh, a term where something must happen or not. Good a condition, um great now everything you said was right and I'm just gonna fill in that a lot of this also has to do with timing and I was hinting at this a minute ago so with a large tra you know you go to the store you say could I have a candy bar? You give the money, they give you the candy bar, it all happens at the same time but with the purchase of a business there's a timetable it doesn't all happen at the same time. So there's a moment where the two parties sign saying we're, you know, we're committing to do this. I will buy, you will sell, but it doesn't happen right away. There's the so-called closing, right? There's the signing date and the closing date. The signing date is the time where the parties enter into a legal commitment to do something. Then there's a period of time and then there's the closing so we go through these again representations are a statement of fact and you said facts are true or not as a particular day. So what's the relevant date on which the representations are supposed to be true? Is it the signing date or is it the closing date? Uh, I believe it's on signing date. Yes, yes, so representations are, are assertions of fact, you know, you're confirming that a fact is true or or not as of the signing date. Now there are usually contractual provisions which require the seller and the buyer when it's a rep about the buyer to reaffirm that it's still true on the closing date and you might hear the phrase that true up clause like that's what that is but basically representations are supposed to be this is what's true at the moment when we are signing and then we go to covenants covenants are a commitment to do something and to do something when. Uh, after signing, very good, we have this period between the signing date and the closing date. Might be a couple weeks, it might be a few months. It depends how complicated the deal is and how much has to get done, but covenants basically are the directions about what the parties are obligated to do after the signing date. Before the closing date, right, so reps are, here's what's true as of the signing date covenants are this is what we have to do between now, the signing date and the closing date, and then a condition when do when is uh the accuracy of a condition, you know, we need to know if it was satisfied. So Yusuf, as of when. Signing date, closing date, something else, uh, a condition is kind of like a, uh, future promise, so it, it should be after closing, I presume. Perfect. This is as of the closing on the closing date this will either be true or not true depending on how the condition is written and if the condition is not satisfied, Yusuf, what happens? There's a consequence. The deal doesn't close. The deal doesn't close. And by the way, like with the covenant, if you don't satisfy the covenant, does the deal still close? Yeah, it probably will. There might be damages. There might be a price adjustment. The condition is sort of a mega covenant. This has to be true or we're not going ahead. So these are the three building blocks of the parts of the contract that we're going to be thinking about reps, what was true as of the signing date, covenants, here's what we're going to do to get this deal done, and conditions. The deal is only going to close if actually, actually these conditions are satisfied, OK. All right, let's move on to the 2nd question. Uh, Vanessa, can you help us with that? She's not here. OK, good, good enough. uh, Claudia. Is Claudia here?

SPEAKER 6
I'm here.

SPEAKER 0
Great. Can you, uh, please read the next question?

SPEAKER 6
Is the following language a representation, a covenant, or a condition? Part A. Target and the shareholder jointly and severally represent, warrant, and agree as follows. Oh. As follows, Target is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the state of Delaware with the power to own its own property, to carry on its business as now being conducted, and to enter into and carry out the terms of this agreement. This is a representation because it's a statement of existing fact of its corporate status.

SPEAKER 0
Exactly right. So I hope you can see this is a classic rep. This states a fact that is true as of the signing date. Can you help us with the next one, please?

SPEAKER 6
Yes. Each balance sheet delivered to acquiring pursuant to this agreement shall reflect all claims, debts, or liabilities of Target, which should be reflected thereon in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This is a covenant because it's a promise about what the balance sheets will reflect, right, right, and you can,

SPEAKER 0
so this is a commitment on the part of one side to provide a financial statement that does these things and it's something that needs to happen after the signing date before the closing date so it's a covenant absolutely can you help us with the next?

SPEAKER 6
During the period from the date hereof to and including the closing, Target will conduct its business solely in the usual and ordinary manner and will refrain from any transaction not in the ordinary course of business or except as otherwise permitted herein unless the prior written consent of acquiring to such transaction has been obtained. This is a condition because it states what the target can do and cannot do between the signing and the closing.

SPEAKER 0
So I know why you're saying that and the truth is that there's a bit of blurriness about what's a condition and what's a covenant, but I think that people usually think of that as a covenant and it's basically establishing. You know the the rules of the road, how are we gonna manage this transition between your ownership and ours in the period of time between the signing date and the closing date and this is known as the ordinary course covenant and the basic idea. Is the management of the seller is supposed to sort of keep the thing in roughly the same condition that it's always been in we bought it thinking it was this way keep it that way and then you know that's your obligation so it's it's a covenant now. It, it, as we'll see because this ordinary course covenant is gonna loom large in the discussion that is to come and violating it might well mean that the deal doesn't go ahead, which makes it makes it start to seem more like a condition so fair point, but I think technically speaking this is meant to be a covenant because it's sort of describing what the parties can and can't do during that interim period, um, OK, uh, Navia. Uh, can you help us with the next question?

SPEAKER 1
Um. Is it, is it the second one, part A?

SPEAKER 0
I am not looking at it because I printed the wrong document. Bullish person's right, yeah, OK, great.

SPEAKER 1
Sorry, I just want to check, um.

SPEAKER 0
But I think we're probably still going through conditions and covenants and reps so what the one we just did was the ordinary course and whatever comes after that.

SPEAKER 1
Um, it says no action or proceeding before a court or any other governmental agency or body shall have been instituted or threatened to restrain or prohibit the merger, um, contemplated hereby. Um, I thought that that was a condition. Um, because if that condition would not be met, then the deal wouldn't go forward, right, so this one is

SPEAKER 0
a condition and it's not unusual for there to be a condition like we'll do this deal, we're committing to do it as long as the government lets us, but if the government objects and we can't persuade the government then the deal's off, right? And so that's, that's a pretty conventional condition antitrust would be a reason other reasons excellent thank you. Can you read the next one?

SPEAKER 1
Um You represent the buyer of a company, you send over the following representation. Target is not subject to any material liability by reason of a violation of any order, rule, or regulation of any federal, state, municipal, or any or other governmental agency. In response, the seller changes the language, find the change, um, what do you learn from the change that they made in the language and what follow up questions do you want to ask, um. Target is not subject to any material liability by reason of a criminal violation of any order, rule, or regulation of any federal, state, municipal, or other governmental agency. Um, so the change is that this limits the liability question to that of a criminal violation, um, which indicates that the target may have some like civil liabilities that they don't wanna. Um, reveal and I think that any buyer based on this language change will want to ask for a list of any possible civil liabilities, um, that the target may be subject to.

SPEAKER 0
Excellent. So let me ask you, am I right that only one word is different?

SPEAKER 1
Um, just the word criminal got added, but everything else

SPEAKER 0
is the same, so it's just one word, so it's not a big deal, right?

SPEAKER 1
I don't agree with that.

SPEAKER 0
You should not agree with that and this is part of what's, you know, fun about being a lawyer and what a good lawyer can do is they can just throw in one word hoping you don't even notice it and if you didn't notice that it would be really bad because of the excellent analysis that you just gave which is that you know this is meant to be giving assurance that there aren't any problems and if I say to you, hey, you know there are no problems, right? and you say yeah there are no criminal problems. There's a whole big universe of other problems that could be there which is why and you were exactly right this is therefore a prompt for the buyer to say OK looks like we need to be a lot more specific about potential. Non-criminal civil problems and if you remember my analogy to Battleship the other day I kind of think of due diligence as Battleship so this is your hit and now you know that civil, uh, potential civil liabilities are the thing you have to explore very good Rahaf, can you help us please with the next question.

SPEAKER 2
It's F, right? Yeah. Target is not subject to any material liability by reason of a violation of any order rule or regulation of any national governmental agency, so they changed governmental agency to national governmental agency and therefore I would ask if they are subject to any violations from state or municipal agencies.

SPEAKER 0
They're essentially carving out the other levels of government. It's just national, so it's the same analysis. You're 100% right. Now we know that we have to ask more questions about things other than the national government because they're avoiding giving us a rep on that. So there must be something we need to know. Can you help us with the next?

SPEAKER 2
You represent the seller. Your client is asked to make the following representation. Target has paid all taxes and assessments, including interest or penalties owed by it to the extent that such taxes and assessments are due. Why might you want to add the word material so that the reps Target has paid all material taxes, to limit the seller's risk because without the word material, even like a material. Pay taxes could be a breach and give the buyer bases not to close.

SPEAKER 0
Good. So when I was representing clients as a tax lawyer and acquisitions, the standard example was, you know, you're not asking about a dog catcher tax, right? I don't know what a dog catcher tax is. I'm not sure they exist anywhere in the world, but it was the shorthand for saying it has to be a meaningful tax and. Just some little you know your trucker didn't pay a toll I guess in theory that's a payment to a governmental agency that they didn't make um but the seller is entitled to say look we don't track everything but we can tell you what's gonna matter to you and so that would be the case for including the word material because materials sort of it's a fancy lawyer's word for relevant you should care about it. Um, and so really what we should do in the next minute or two is think about when a materiality limitation might be appropriate, when it might not be appropriate. Uh, Shahad, can you help us please with the next continuing with that theme.

SPEAKER 7
Yes, um, let's say we define material as an issue involving at least $500. Do you see a problem with defining materiality materiality in this way? Hint doesn't, does it matter? How many non-material facts are left out? How can we deal with this problem? Um, so basically the issue is that, um, in this way in the aggregate non-material taxes, um, and assessments can add up to a lot. Um, we can solve this issue by putting a cap on the non-material total.

SPEAKER 0
Excellent. So the point is, um, materiality is something less than $100. That sounds pretty good. That sounds pretty good, but the problem is just as you said, if you've got. a million of these each at $99 then it's a $99 million issue which is gonna be material so you need to know both the scope of each incident. And you need to know the potential number of incidents just as you said. So what do you do? Usually materiality is defined with uh two criteria, right? So each incident is less than call it $100 call it whatever you want, $1000 10,000 dollars, whatever. And in the aggregate together they are all less than you know a million dollars, $50,000 whatever the relevant number would be, um, and this is the way you can deal with the fact that there's the individual incident and what in the aggregate is true and, and we have to be mindful of that. Good, can you help us with the next?

SPEAKER 7
Um, buyer wants to buy a plot of land and ask seller to give assurance that seller actually owns the land. Seller sends over the following representation. To the best of my knowledge, I'm the legal owner of this land. You represent the buyer who asks whether he should accept this representation. Are you comfortable with it? Um, I wouldn't be comfortable with it because basically provides the buyer with less recourse if the seller does not own the land.

SPEAKER 0
So, um, what we know is that the other side of the transaction never wants uh to the best of my knowledge, and your side of the transaction is always gonna want to the best of my knowledge because it takes a bit of the pressure off if there's something that. Is bad and you didn't disclose it you can say well look I'm sorry I I didn't know and so on uh and so then that brings up the question of when if ever is it reasonable um and what would you know what would make it reasonable for someone to take that position and is it reasonable here so back to you and I know you you said but maybe just a word more about why you think here uh you shouldn't be allowed to say to the best of my knowledge.

SPEAKER 7
Yeah, because basically if the seller does not own the land, um, the buyer would not have any recourse.

SPEAKER 0
Good, so I think it has to do with a lack of a remedy that's true and I also think there's this question of is this something you should know and who's in a position to know it if not you. And so the truth is in pretty much every jurisdiction that I know of there's a process for registering the ownership of land and you as the owner you're supposed to do that and so if you're out there selling the land then I think it's it's reasonable for the buyer to think that you've done that and if you've done that you have no ability to say to the best of my knowledge because either you registered it and the title is good. Or you didn't and if you didn't don't waste my time but it would be odd to think that someone other than you would would know that can you help us with the next one?

SPEAKER 7
Buyer wants to buy a business and asks the seller to give assurance that no one has already sued the business and that no one is threatening to sue the business in the future. Seller offers the following representation. No one has sued our business and to the best of the knowledge, no one is threatening to sue the business. You represent the buyer. Are you comfortable, comfortable with this representation? Um, I would be comfortable with this because the seller only. Knows if someone is threatening to sue the company to the best of his knowledge, right, so there may be

SPEAKER 0
someone who is planning to sue and they haven't made it so clear to you yet and so therefore you know we've had some. Unpleasant interactions. I know they're not happy, but sadly this happens a lot and very rarely does it lead to a lawsuit, so I don't know if they're gonna sue and I don't, I, I, I couldn't tell you, but, but to the best of my knowledge these are the four people who I think. Are threatening it as opposed to maybe just thinking about it and these are the people who've already sued us and so the key difference here which I'm sure you see is the things that you control. To the best of my knowledge is not really a reasonable thing to say, but when you're making predictions about what other people might do and you don't control them, then it is a much more reasonable position to take, and we kind of see a bit of a, a difference there, Farhan. You have the best of my knowledge. Yes, my knowledge was my knowledge. Oh. I, I, I personally am not convinced that they're that different, but there are these different formulations and some people focus on them much more than I do, so, uh, I'm lazy about that. Um, great, uh, Lena, uh, Lena, can you help us please with the next question?

SPEAKER 2
Yes, um, can you hear me?

SPEAKER 0
I do.

SPEAKER 2
False representation. What happens if a seller gives a representation that turns out not to be true? Can you think of a circumstances in which a buyer does not get any meaningful protection from a representation, even if he can easily show it was false?

SPEAKER 0
So what do you think?

SPEAKER 2
I, I think if it was false, the buyer might not get any like damages or anything because the seller doesn't have any money basically or any assets.

SPEAKER 0
Sorry, can you just speak a little louder? I didn't hear that part.

SPEAKER 2
Uh, if, if the representation was not true and, um, let's say the seller was insolvent or does not have any assets, the buyer might not be able to get anything.

SPEAKER 0
Very good. So look, if we have it in writing. It's a pretty good insurance policy, but it's not perfect and one problem with it is let's say the other side has gone bankrupt like you can sue them, you can try to get the money, but good luck you're there in line with all the other creditors, so that's certainly, um, that that's certainly an issue, um. By the way, is it um. Is it expensive or cheap to bring a lawsuit? It's expensive. It can be expensive. So another thing to think about is if they violated a rep. And it's cost me $100 but it would cost me $21 to bring a lawsuit, then it's not really rational for me to chase this even if, uh, even if I think I could win. So there's sort of insolvency of the other side is one reason why it's not gonna give you great comfort. There's the expense of trying to get a remedy, which is another and so then, uh, next question if you could.

SPEAKER 2
How can a buyer plan in advance to prevent this sort of problem? Um, maybe the buyer can get some like guarantee from the seller or. To put the money or the purchase price in escrow, yes, that's exactly the point is um this insolvency problem

SPEAKER 0
and the need to chase people and to spend money to get it, you can solve that by having money set aside specifically in the transaction. We're going to set aside this amount which is going to cover violations of. Reps by the seller, so you know I, the buyer, I'm paying the full purchase price, but some of it is gonna be put in this escrow account and again this is a lot like the situation we discussed with the pool and the due diligence it's just an application of the same point. Let's make it easy to get access to money that will cover any mistakes or inaccuracies in the reps and then it becomes a more meaningful thing because you don't have to worry about insolvency you don't have to worry about bringing a lawsuit and so on it's just a process that will do it, um, the next one please.

SPEAKER 2
Explain why a buyer might demand the following language in an acquisition agreement. Seller thereby agrees that at the closing upon receipt of the merger shares, he will immediately deposit 15,000 of such merger shares into escrow for a period ending no later than 42 months after the closing, at which the time the escrowed mergerer shares then remaining escrow will be returned to him. Uh, this is to protect the buyer. In case that opposition turn out to be not true.

SPEAKER 0
And in fact this is exactly the idea that we were just discussing. It's just a contractual term that creates an escrow in this case the purchase price was shares, so you're putting some of the purchase price aside to cover um. Mistakes or inaccuracies in in reps, thank you. Any questions or comments? Yeah, go ahead. Does this matter for asset sales versus stock sales of companies? Um, you're gonna have reps either way, but with, uh, an asset sale they're probably not gonna be reps to the same degree about the liabilities of what you're buying because you don't take them on. So I, I think the point is the actual mechanisms, if you can call them that, of having reps and maybe having an indemnity to cover them, you're gonna see that either way, but the need for reps is significantly greater. In a stock deal and the scope of what's going to be discussed is gonna be different. Good question. Excellent. um, yes, please. In general, why would you buy a company that is at risk of bankruptcy and therefore exposing yourself to that risk? Um, so they may have a pretty good business that you like. And they just may have taken on more debt than they should have and may be an opportunity for you, but on the other hand, to the extent that that's true, then you have to be extra worried that maybe they're not so concerned about what they do and don't tell you because like they, what can you do to them, which is probably an even stronger case for an indemnity in a situation like that, um, but fair point absolutely. Yes. Um, so if a condition is, um, like if a condition doesn't happen, you're allowed to back out of the deal. What's kind of the recourse if one of the representations or the covenants turns out not to be true? Yeah, it's usually gonna be money damages, uh, basically, and, and this is why the indemnity is, is sort of important. Um, because in general deals go through even if they're imperfections in what the parties have told each other, uh, you can understand why that's not gonna happen if the government is gonna view the combination as illegal, which is why the condition, uh, would be, um, needed for a situation like that, um, but what we're about to see is, um. You know, the, the ordinary course covenant can sometimes be invoked to stop a deal, uh, although a judge might also say just damages and it goes ahead, uh, so we're gonna talk a bit about that. Good question. Uh, anyone else? Yes.

SPEAKER 8
Hi, I was wondering if there was any amount of reps, covenants or conditions that would worry you in a contract. So there will be way too many for the situation or just not enough, and how would you tell?

SPEAKER 0
So the complexity of the business and of the deal is certainly going to affect um what you want and uh I'm a compulsive person so I have a high tolerance for this but we do have to think about when you'll get to the point where the other side is just gonna really lose it and say no it's enough and given that there is an element of that, so it's a good question you do wanna prioritize a little bit in your own mind and start with the things that you're most worried about. Um, but, uh, again, you know, different law firms have different approaches in terms of how detailed they wanna be. Diff different commercial parties have, uh, you know, have different styles, so there, there's a kind of a context specific correct amount that you may diverge from or not, and that's where the issue arises. So good question, yes. to the definition of representation. Well, I understand that in principle, uh, representation is a statement of fact referring to a specific timing, but I'm still, I'm just curious about um how often is it seen in the United States deal to have a bring down clause, which means the representation will be staying also pretty typical both times pretty typical. So the idea is um. You sign on the basis that it's true, but then you're supposed to tell people if it's no longer true, and I think that that kind of clause is pretty standard. So good question. The one is regarding um. Best of your knowledge clause. Um, if a contract set forth that, um, the seller to the to the best knowledge of the seller, uh, does this requires the seller to conduct reasonable diligence or investigation? Does it means pass the knowledge upon reasonable investigation. Vessels launched upon my. Yeah, there's a, there's a bit of an ambiguity there. I, I think judges would want you. Like willful ignorance wouldn't work, um, but on the other hand it does sort of raise the question of. Well, you, you didn't know that like really? Or in another situation like well we, you know, we really would have had to engage in 1000 hours of checking in order to find this and like that's clearly fine you shouldn't have known that but um but I look I, I will just say for myself I'm not a huge fan of to the best of my knowledge partly because of the good point that you just made which is well. How, how informed does that knowledge have to be and what steps do you need to take and the annoying thing is that if you speak to a corporate lawyer they're gonna say well it it has to be reasonable. Oh, that clears things up for me, right? Anyway, I'm, I'm too compulsive to accept reasonable as a as a guide, but that is what people often say. Yes.

SPEAKER 4
Um, so look, this is just a. Question out of curiosity. So I remember like, um, when I was working on sales and stuff, we would post the bond after receiving an advance payment or the other person would do the same thing. And I feel like that kind of sounds like an escrow account. Is there a difference between the two?

SPEAKER 0
Different jurisdictions call them different things, structure them differently. There are some places where an actual escrow account is a nightmare to create and so people will use some sort of collateral instead, but, but I think the principle is the same so good question. All right, um, let's turn to the next question. So Emerson, if we can come back to you, um, can you read the next one? Are we now at Ann owned a shopping mall? Did we get there? That's what I thought, OK.

SPEAKER 8
Anne owned a shopping mall during the pandemic. One of her tenants, Ben, owned a restaurant. Ben's lease ran through 2023. Because of the pandemic, Ben had to close his restaurant on April 1st, 2020 and did not send Anne any rent for several months starting in April. The lease had no exceptions for pandemics or for anything else, so Ben was clearly breaching his contractual commitment. Why might Anne have decided not to evict Ben? Why might she have been willing instead to forgive some rent if he agreed eventually to pay the rest later when his business revived? What does this fact pattern tell us about the limits of the influence of contracts? So my response to this was that she might have decided not to evict because no other tenant for the restaurant could make the rent payments during COVID as well and that forgiveness would actually allow her to keep the tenant and possibly recoup those rent payments if things turned around without going through that process of seeking for another tenant or any of the contractual breach and contracts are limited in their influence depending on the situation.

SPEAKER 0
Good, yeah, no, that's, that's absolutely right. And the point is we as lawyers are inclined to think look I have a contract. I have a contractual right I should enforce this right this person owes me money and we should get paid, right? And I was on the board of a real estate company during the pandemic where we faced this situation all the time and I came to realize that the people who ran the company had a more. Uh, sophisticated view of this than perhaps I did, um, you know, one thing that you guys may or may not know is that New York's court system was basically closed during much of the pandemic, so it's not like you really could sue for damages like there were criminal proceedings going on, but civil was basically on hold. And then you know the, the further point is you couldn't evict people like that was also in force during the pandemic so what's your leverage, um, but ultimately that was sort of the negative reason why you couldn't pursue legal action but there was this positive reason which you mentioned which is like, OK, so I could get them out eventually they'd probably just be willing to leave, but who's gonna take over? Like then I have to find a tenant and so what. This company did and it was smart is they forgave a certain amount and then they significantly discounted the rent and then the idea was but you'll pay us the full amount when you can and we're assuming that that'll be by date X and so because the very worst thing for a real estate company is to have an empty space with no one paying at all, uh, and because it was entirely realistic to expect that that's what would happen if you managed to get rid of the tenants you had because you know who wanted to. Have a lease on a restaurant during the pandemic when you couldn't be open. So basically just as you said, uh, even though you have this piece of paper and everybody signed it it was of only limited relevance in those circumstances and so uh I'd say the people who are more sophisticated than I was realized that this was an opportunity to try to build some goodwill and in effect have an option to keep this tenant so they wouldn't have to look for other tenants uh and the way this has played out over time is there was a period of significant discounting. And I think now you know things have changed a lot and the market is back up and so uh what comes around goes around in a way so very good um OK, uh, Mohammed, can you help us please with part two about Carl.

SPEAKER 9
So Carl's the CEO and largest shareholder for a public company called C Brands, which owns a chain chain of stores and a popular brand of women's apparel called D's Secret. Sales have been flat or declining for several years. In January 2020, Carl signs a deal in which a private equity firm, Evergreen, agrees to buy 55% of the stock of Crands. The deal has a MAC clause which specifically carves out the COVID-19 pandemic, so Evergreen cannot invoke the pandemic as a reason to terminate the deal. In the contract, CBrands makes the following commitment. The seller will continue to operate the business in the ordinary course and will not take any major actions without the prior consent of the buyer. In response to the pandemic, most of Crand's stores were legally required to close. Carl decides to furlough 1600 employees and also stops paying rent on most of the stores. Carl also slashes employee compensation. As you read the language above, do any of these steps give Evergreen the right to cancel the deal? So in my opinion, I see that even though Evergreen may not be able to cancel the deal because of the material adverse change clause, they may be able to terminate through ordinary course of business because during the pandemic, Crands had to close stores and furlough employees, and this is not this is not a fashion in which a company operates in a normal course of business, i.e., to stop paying grant, furloughing employees. That's my very good.

SPEAKER 0
So who has heard of Victoria's Secret? OK, so this is what happened. Victoria's Secret was under contract to be sold as the pandemic began. You may remember the pandemic before it came to the United States in March, early March of, uh, 2020 was already in. Italy, it was already in China, it was, it was in places and so the lawyers on this deal for the seller, uh, for the Limited by the way, El Brands is the was the seller, um, they knew about the pandemic and so they made a point of including in the contract that the pandemic didn't count as the kind of material adverse change that would kill the deal so they thought they were in the clear, um, but then the buyer, a private equity firm said wait a minute. What's going on here? You said you, you committed to operating in the ordinary course, and here you've fired 1000 people, so we think you haven't operated in the ordinary course and so we think that the deal can't proceed because you violated the contract. So Mohammed, back to you, putting aside, imagine that you were. The buyer and imagine that getting out of the deal isn't an option and of course what we're seeing is of course the buyer wanted to get out of the deal the world had changed the market for you know this product was not what it had been hopefully the world will change it'll come back, but who knows when, who knows how long let's, you know, I wish we hadn't bought this can we get out of it? Like that's what was really going on but assume you were stuck you're the buyer you were stuck. Do you want Karl, who is running this for you in effect because you're gonna buy it, do you want him to keep paying employees when they can't legally work or was furloughing the reasonable and correct thing to do from the perspective of the business owner?

SPEAKER 9
From like the buyer's perspective or a business owner's perspective, it wouldn't make sense to pay like. Pay pay salaries for employees who can't actually like go to work like it was it was a legal requirement at the time so I try to find some sort of settlement out of this.

SPEAKER 0
So there's a way in which Carl was doing an honorable thing and furloughing people never feels honorable so maybe that's the wrong word, but he was, he was doing the responsible thing for the buyer. By taking this step and let's just look at Part B and then we'll kind of resolve them both together because they present similar issues. Can you read B for us?

SPEAKER 9
So Evergreen brings a lawsuit to terminate the deal. Among other reasons, Evergreen alleges that De Brands has drastically reduced new merchandise merchandise receipts, which, when coupled with DBrand's failure to dispose of existing out of season, obsolete and excess merchandise, has saddled the D secret business with a stock of merchandise of greatly diminished value. Based on the contractual language above, do you think this is a winning argument? I'd say that even the buyer would have like a similar claim that they wanted to be consulted before a major action occurred, but yet again this was not an ordinary course of business like having and acquiring inventory, then in a very short period of time, not being able to sell it because of like an adverse change that happened is not ordinary course of business even though there is a MAC clause included.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, so once again. The decision that the selling management made not to buy a lot of new stuff that they knew they couldn't sell and the buyer wouldn't be able to sell as soon as they took it over, there's a way in which the seller should have wanted them to do it, but Mohammed back to you, we, we look at that ordinary clause language, true or false, it says operate the business um however you think it should be operated. Even if it's different and you don't have to talk to us, is that what the contract says?

SPEAKER 9
I Don't believe so. Because I think, I think the buyer in any case would have wanted to be consulted in any major action that would occur even though during negotiations of the acquisition

prior consent of the buyer, right, the language says just as you said, Mohammed, um, the seller will continue to operate the business in the ordinary course and will not take any major actions without the prior consent of the buyer. So Judge Mohammed, they bring a lawsuit saying this is a violation of the covenant. Do you agree?

SPEAKER 9
If it's on that basis, I might, yes, considering all the facts.

SPEAKER 0
It was, it was to the point where the Limited gave up, right? They didn't even litigate it. They just like their lawyers looked at it and said, oh darn. And so the deal went away the, the, they, they couldn't sell it to this private equity firm because they had acted not in the ordinary course without getting consent without this consultation and what I think must have particularly hurt from the perspective. of the seller is if they had consulted, is there any doubt that the buyer would have said yeah do that uh don't pay these people you gotta furlough them yeah no definitely don't buy new inventory because what are we gonna do? Yeah, thanks for that no we agree like. How could they have not consented? I'm sure they would have, but the fact that this didn't happen gave the seller, uh, or gave the buyer the ability to, um, you know, to, uh, to end the deal. Um, we're gonna start here at part C. And we will keep working on this discussion, uh, I guess it's Monday, right? Today is Wednesday, so looking forward to seeing, oh yeah, looking forward to seeing you all on Monday. One other thing to tell you is we missed that snow day, so the makeup is gonna be a week from Friday and. Uh, the registrar is gonna send you an email about this, but it's gonna be a week from Friday at our usual time like 1:20 to 2:40. I realize some of you may not be here. If I'm speaking to an empty room, I will do my best because it will be recorded. So watch for an email about that. Thanks everybody.

SPEAKER 1
Do you think you. Evergreen. Um right You know the. Right, right. Exactly, and principle, they could have tried it. I think it was. and Um See. I. They, I thought like it might be a. Yes. Um, so what usually will happen is that. the the other side. That's. It's not always in the contract, but it's usually.

SPEAKER 0
If it's, if then it's just as of the signing date if there's no so-called screw up or bring down clause, but there usually is.

SPEAKER 1
That's right.

SPEAKER 0
You have to show that it was false then. But, but you might still be able to get damages.

SPEAKER 1
It's just that you, you have to show it as

SPEAKER 0
a.

SPEAKER 1
I like Sorry, no problem, um.

SPEAKER 0
So if it was false on the signing dates, you should be able to collect damages later. Uh, unless, you know, they, there's this whole idea of they don't survive the closing, but that's unusual, uh, so anyway, I think the, the main question is not can you collect later, but can you collect. And that's where the true offer brings. No.

SPEAKER 2
Yes
