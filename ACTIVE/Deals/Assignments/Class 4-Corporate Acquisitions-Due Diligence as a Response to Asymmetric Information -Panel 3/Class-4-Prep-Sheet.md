# Class 4 Prep Sheet: Corporate Acquisitions - Due Diligence as a Response to Asymmetric Information

**Course:** Deals
**Topic:** Corporate Acquisitions: Due Diligence as a Response to Asymmetric Information
**Date:** Spring Semester 2026

---

## Key Concepts Overview

This class focuses on **due diligence** as a fundamental tool for addressing **asymmetric information** in corporate acquisitions. Key themes include:

- **Vertical integration** as a solution to contracting problems
- **Due diligence** as the buyer's investigation to verify seller's claims
- **Asset deals vs. stock deals** and how they affect information needs
- **Representations and warranties** as mechanisms for information production
- **Third-party experts** (accountants, investment bankers, lawyers) who verify information and vouch for deal aspects
- **Information cost minimization** - allocating information production to the lowest-cost provider
- **The cooperative nature of due diligence** - seller and buyer both benefit from reducing information asymmetry

**The core insight:** Due diligence exists because sellers know more about their businesses than buyers do. The law of acquisitions (representations & warranties, opinions, diligence review) is essentially a system for producing and verifying information at the lowest possible cost.

## Question 1: Steve's Software Contract Problem

### A. Advice About Contracting for Quality Standards

**Steve's vague standards ("unique and innovative," "really good, creative, different") create a fundamental contracting problem.**

**The core issue:** Courts can enforce specific obligations, but they cannot enforce subjective quality judgments. "Good" and "innovative" mean different things to different people.

**Advice to give Steve:**

1. **Define objective metrics:** Instead of "innovative," specify measurable criteria:
   - Processing speed benchmarks
   - Number of simultaneous users supported
   - Compatibility with specific hardware
   - Response time requirements
   - Bug/error rate thresholds

2. **Create specific deliverables:** Rather than "an operating system," contract for:
   - A system that runs on XYZ hardware
   - With ABC specific features
   - That passes XYZ testing protocols

3. **Include acceptance testing:** Steve should have the right to test and approve the software before final payment

4. **Stage payments:** Link payments to achievement of milestones (not "innovation")

**Will the contract be effective? NO - not if Steve insists on subjective standards.** Courts are terrible at judging whether something is "creative" or "innovative." A contract works best when obligations are objectively measurable.

### B. Non-Legal Reasons for Software Developers to Perform Well

**YES - developers have strong reputational and business reasons to deliver quality:**

1. **Reputation in the industry:** Word spreads about good and bad developers
2. **Future business opportunities:** Steve might hire them again or recommend them
3. **Portfolio building:** They can use successful projects to attract other clients
4. **Professional pride:** Many developers take pride in their craft
5. **Market discipline:** Competition means they need satisfied customers to stay in business

**But these incentives have limits:**
- If the developer is desperate for cash now, they might cut corners
- If the developer doesn't plan to be in business long, reputation matters less
- One-time clients provide less reputational incentive than repeat clients

### C. If Contracting and Reputation Aren't Enough - Vertical Integration

**When arms-length contracting fails, the solution is often vertical integration - owning both businesses.**

**What Steve can do:**
- Buy the software development company outright
- Hire the developers as employees
- Bring the software development in-house

**Why this works:**
- **Aligned incentives:** Employees' success is tied to the company's success
- **Direct control:** Steve can supervise day-to-day work
- **Information sharing:** No more information asymmetry - Steve sees everything
- **Contracting replaced by management:** Employment contracts are simpler than performance contracts

**The fundamental insight:** When you can't write a complete contract to govern a transaction, sometimes the best solution is to eliminate the transaction entirely by putting both activities under one owner.

### D. Vertical Integration - Definition and Purpose

**Vertical integration** occurs when a company owns multiple stages of production or distribution in its supply chain, rather than contracting with separate companies for each stage.

**Example:** Apple owning:
- The retail stores (Apple Stores)
- The hardware design
- The operating system software
- The chip design
- (But not the manufacturing - that's outsourced to Foxconn)

**The "make or buy decision:**** For any activity, a company must decide:
- **Make:** Do it in-house (vertical integration)
- **Buy:** Purchase from an outside supplier (arms-length transaction)

**Economic problems vertical integration solves:**

1. **Information asymmetry:** The parent company knows what's happening internally
2. **Contracting difficulties:** No need for complex performance contracts when you own the operation
3. **Agency costs:** Managers report to the parent company, not to outside shareholders
4. **Coordination problems:** Easier to align activities across the supply chain
5. **Transaction costs:** Avoid repeated negotiations for each interaction

**Costs of vertical integration:**
- Less flexibility (locked into internal suppliers)
- Higher fixed costs
- Possible bureaucratic inefficiencies
- Loss of competitive discipline (external suppliers must compete)

## Question 2: Jim's Law Firm - Freelance Lawyers

### A. What Jim Might Like About Freelance Lawyers

1. **Flexibility:** Only pay for lawyers when needed
2. **Cost savings:** No benefits, office space, or commitment to keep them busy
3. **Scalability:** Can scale up during busy periods, down during slow periods
4. **Specialized expertise:** Can hire experts for specific assignments
5. **Trial before commitment:** Can evaluate someone before offering permanent position

**This is similar to "gig economy" benefits - Uber drivers, freelance writers, etc.**

### B. Why Jim Might Hesitate

1. **Quality control:** Freelancers may not meet Jim's standards
2. **Confidentiality concerns:** Sharing sensitive client information with temporary workers
3. **Training costs:** Time invested training people who won't stay
4. **Loyalty and commitment:** Freelancers don't have the same investment in the firm's reputation
5. **Client relations:** Clients might prefer consistent representation
6. **Bar admission requirements:** Lawyers must be admitted in the jurisdiction
7. **Malpractice insurance:** Coverage issues for temporary lawyers
8. **Cultural fit:** Freelancers may not share firm's values and approach

**The fundamental problem:** Can you trust freelancers with your clients' important matters?

### C. The Alternative - Hiring Permanent Associates

**The alternative: Hire more permanent associates**

**Benefits compared to freelancers:**
- **Quality control:** Can carefully select and train them
- **Investment in firm:** Associates have career incentives to perform well
- **Client relationships:** Build long-term relationships with clients
- **Firm culture:** Associates learn firm's methods and values
- **Confidentiality:** More comfortable sharing sensitive information
- **Availability:** Associates are available when needed, not just for specific assignments

**Costs compared to freelancers:**
- **Higher fixed costs:** Salary, benefits, office space even when work is slow
- **Less flexibility:** Committed to paying associates regardless of workload
- **Higher commitment:** Firing associates is difficult and disruptive

**The trade-off:**
- **Freelancers:** Lower fixed costs, higher transaction costs, higher risk
- **Permanent employees:** Higher fixed costs, lower transaction costs, lower risk

**This is the classic "make or buy" problem:**
- **Make:** Hire associates (insourcing)
- **Buy:** Use freelancers (outsourcing)

## Question 3: Due Diligence - Definition and Purpose

### **Due Diligence** - Definition

**Due diligence** is the comprehensive investigation and verification process that a buyer conducts before completing an acquisition to assess the target company's assets, liabilities, operations, and risks.

**The problem it solves: ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION**

- The seller knows everything about the business
- The buyer knows very little
- Due diligence is how the buyer reduces this information gap

**How due diligence works:**
- Buyer reviews financial statements, contracts, litigation, employment matters, etc.
- Buyer interviews management
- Buyer may bring in third-party experts (accountants, lawyers, consultants)
- Seller provides information through representations and warranties
- Buyer verifies the information provided

**How the buyer knows the seller is telling the truth:**

1. **Legal accountability through representations & warranties:** Seller makes written statements about the business. If they're false, seller can be sued for breach.

2. **Verification by third parties:** Accountants check the financial statements, lawyers review contracts, consultants assess operations.

3. **Access to documents:** Buyer gets to see actual records, not just seller's summaries.

4. **Right to walk away:** Due diligence findings allow buyer to renegotiate price or back out entirely.

5. **Indemnification and escrow:** Part of purchase price held back to cover any undiscovered problems.

6. **Reputational incentives:** Sellers who lie in deals struggle to complete future transactions.

## Question 4: Asset Deals vs. Stock Deals

### A. Logistical Differences - What Buyer Buys

**Asset Deal:**
- Buyer purchases **specific assets and liabilities** of the seller
- Buyer chooses what to buy (equipment, inventory, intellectual property, contracts)
- Buyer typically assumes only selected liabilities
- Seller keeps unwanted assets and liabilities
- Seller continues to own the corporate shell (unless this was all the assets)

**Stock Deal:**
- Buyer purchases **the stock (shares) of the seller's corporation**
- Buyer gets everything - all assets AND all liabilities
- The corporate shell remains intact
- Buyer steps into seller's shoes as the owner of the corporation
- All contracts, permits, licenses generally remain in place (no need to transfer)

**Analogy:**
- **Asset deal:** Buying a house's furniture and appliances (you pick what you want)
- **Stock deal:** Buying the house itself with everything inside (you get it all - the good and the bad)

### B. Unfiled Patent - Asset Deal vs. Stock Deal

**Asset Deal: NO, Buyer doesn't need to worry.**

- Buyer is buying specific assets
- If the patent isn't among the purchased assets, Buyer doesn't get it - and doesn't inherit the problem
- Buyer can simply not include the unfiled patent in the purchase
- Seller keeps the problem

**Stock Deal: YES, Buyer needs to worry.**

- Buyer buys the entire corporation
- Buyer inherits all assets, including the improperly filed patent
- Buyer also inherits any legal problems associated with the bad filing
- The patent problem is now Buyer's problem

**Key lesson:** Stock deals expose buyer to ALL liabilities, even hidden ones. Asset deals let buyer choose which liabilities to assume.

### C. Cheap Lease - Asset Deal vs. Stock Deal

**Asset Deal: YES, Buyer needs to worry.**

- Most leases have provisions that they terminate or require consent on transfer of assets
- If Seller is no longer the counterparty, the lease may expire
- Buyer would need to:
  - Get landlord's consent to assign the lease
  - Or negotiate a new lease (probably at higher rent)
  - Or risk losing the cheap lease entirely

**Stock Deal: NO, Buyer generally doesn't need to worry.**

- The corporate entity remains the same
- The lease stays in place - no transfer occurs
- The tenant is still the same corporation (just under new ownership)
- Exception: Some leases have change-of-control triggers, but these are less common

**Key lesson:** Asset deals can trigger third-party consents. Stock deals preserve existing contractual relationships.

### D. Unpaid Taxes - Asset Deal vs. Stock Deal

**Asset Deal: NO, Buyer doesn't need to worry (usually).**

- Tax liabilities generally stay with the selling corporation
- Seller remains responsible for its unpaid taxes
- Buyer is starting fresh with a new business (though there are exceptions like sales tax and bulk sales laws in some states)

**Stock Deal: YES, Buyer needs to worry.**

- Buyer inherits the corporate entity
- ALL unpaid taxes come with the corporation
- This includes:
  - Income taxes
  - Payroll taxes
  - Sales taxes
  - Property taxes
  - Any tax penalties and interest

**Key lesson:** Stock buyers must do extensive tax due diligence. Asset buyers generally don't inherit tax liabilities (with some limited exceptions).

### E. Employee Harassment - Asset Deal vs. Stock Deal

**Asset Deal: NO, Buyer doesn't need to worry.**

- The employee who made inappropriate jokes is no longer Buyer's employee
- Buyer is hiring new employees (or selectively assuming employment contracts)
- The harassment liability stays with Seller
- Exception: If the employee had a pending lawsuit or claim, there might be some successor liability issues

**Stock Deal: POTENTIALLY YES, Buyer needs to worry.**

- Buyer inherits all employment liabilities
- The terminated employee could still sue the company for harassment that occurred before the sale
- The company (now owned by Buyer) could be liable for:
  - The harassment itself
  - Failure to prevent harassment
  - Hostile work environment
  - Any damages awarded

**Key lesson:** Stock buyers inherit employment-related liabilities. Asset buyers can leave these behind (with some exceptions for ongoing litigation).

### F. Buyer's Unpaid Taxes - Asset Deal vs. Stock Deal

**Asset Deal: NO, Seller doesn't need to worry.**

- Seller is selling assets - getting cash
- Seller's relationship with Buyer ends at closing
- Seller has no ongoing exposure to Buyer's tax problems
- This is a one-time transaction

**Stock Deal: NO, Seller doesn't need to worry (usually).**

- Seller is selling the stock and leaving
- Once the sale closes, Seller has no further relationship with the corporation
- Seller is not liable for Buyer's tax problems
- Exception: If Seller provides representations & warranties about Buyer's tax status and those are false, Seller could be liable for breach

**Key insight:** In most acquisitions, the seller is leaving the business. The seller's tax problems don't typically become the buyer's problem, and vice versa. The parties go their separate ways.

### G. Drug Patent with Contingent Payment - Asset Deal vs. Stock Deal

**Scenario:**
- Buyer is buying a drug patent from Seller (asset deal)
- Uncertainty about whether the drug will work
- Buyer pays first installment now, contingent payment in 2 years based on whether drug works
- Buyer hasn't paid its taxes for 3 years

**Asset Deal: NO, Seller doesn't need to worry about Buyer's tax problems.**

- Seller is selling the patent asset to Buyer
- The deal is: Patent → Cash
- Once Seller receives the first installment, the relationship is largely complete
- The contingent payment obligation is Buyer's problem, not Seller's
- Seller's risk is limited to:
  - Whether Buyer can make the contingent payment
  - Whether Buyer will still exist in 2 years
- But Seller is NOT liable for Buyer's tax problems

**Key lesson:** In an asset sale, the seller is not taking on Buyer's corporate obligations. The seller is simply getting paid (now and later) for an asset.

**Important distinction:** The question asks if Seller needs to worry about Buyer's unpaid taxes. The answer is NO - those are Buyer's corporate liabilities. Seller's only real worry is whether Buyer will be able to make the contingent payment when the time comes (credit risk, not tax risk).

## Question 5: Theme Park Due Diligence

### A. Video Game User Information - Why Buyer Wants It

**Buyer wants user data to assess the value of the new ride.**

**Why Buyer wants this information:**
1. **Predict future ride popularity:** Past game success may predict movie and ride success
2. **Valuation:** User numbers help determine if the price is fair
3. **Risk assessment:** Declining users might signal the franchise is fading
4. **Revenue projections:** More users → more moviegoers → more park visitors
5. **Due diligence:** Part of Buyer's investigation to reduce information asymmetry

**Should Seller provide it? YES.**

- This is historical factual data
- Seller has it; Buyer doesn't (classic asymmetric information)
- Providing the information facilitates the deal
- Gilson's point: Seller has incentive to share because withholding suggests the data is bad

### B. Does This Support Gilson's Cooperative View?

**YES - this strongly supports Gilson's view.**

**Gilson's argument:** Due diligence should be cooperative because both parties benefit from reducing information asymmetry at the lowest possible cost.

**How this example supports Gilson:**
- Seller already has the user data (low cost to provide)
- Buyer needs it to value the business
- If Seller refuses, Buyer will assume the worst
- Providing factual data helps both parties reach a fair deal efficiently
- This is a win-win - not zero-sum

**The cooperative insight:** When the information is factual and already exists, sharing it creates value for both parties by enabling accurate pricing and reducing transaction costs.

### C. Movie Focus Group Information - Why Buyer Wants It, Why Seller Hesitates

**Why Buyer wants focus group information:**
1. **Predict movie success:** Early reactions help forecast box office performance
2. **Assess ride potential:** Successful movie → successful ride
3. **Valuation:** Helps Buyer determine fair price
4. **Risk assessment:** Poor focus group reactions might signal problems

**Why Seller is more concerned about movie questions:**

**The key difference:** Game user data is about the **PAST** (facts), but movie focus group data is about the **FUTURE** (predictions).

**Seller's concerns:**

1. **Uncertainty:** Focus groups are predictions, not guarantees. The movie might succeed even with mediocre focus groups, or fail with great ones.

2. **Liability for predictions:** If Seller shares focus group data and the movie flops, Buyer might claim Seller misled them.

3. **Interpretation disputes:** Focus group reactions are subjective. Different people might interpret them differently.

4. **Legal risk:** Sharing forward-looking information can create legal exposure if things go wrong.

5. **Competitive harm:** If deal doesn't close, this sensitive pre-release information could leak and hurt the movie.

**The key distinction:**
- **Past facts (game users):** Objective, verifiable, less legal risk
- **Future predictions (movie):** Speculative, subjective, more legal risk

### D. Does This Support or Undercut Gilson's Cooperative View?

**This COMPLICATES Gilson's view but doesn't completely undercut it.**

**How it undercuts cooperation:**
- Seller has legitimate reasons NOT to share certain information
- Sharing predictions creates legal and business risks for Seller
- This isn't just about information asymmetry - it's about allocation of risk
- Seller might prefer to say "You assess the movie yourself" rather than share subjective focus group data

**How Gilson might respond:**
- The cooperative approach can address this through representations & warranties
- Seller can provide the information but qualify it appropriately
- The parties can allocate the risk of movie performance through the deal structure
- The question is who can cheapest assess and bear this risk

**The nuanced view:**
- Cooperation works well for **past facts** that already exist
- Cooperation is harder for **future predictions** that involve uncertainty
- For predictions, the issue shifts from "who should produce the information" to "who should bear the risk if predictions are wrong"

**This connects to the broader theme:** When information is too costly or risky to produce, the solution is often allocating the risk to the party best able to bear it (through contingent payments, representations, etc.).

## Question 6: Carol's Drug Company - Bad News Dilemma

### A. Carol's Incentives Without Legal Constraints

**What Carol wants to say:**
- **Share the good news:** "The drug cures colds!" ✓
- **Hide the bad news:** Say nothing about side effects ✗
- **Emphasize the positive:** Focus on the breakthrough
- **Downplay the negative:** Minimize or omit side effect concerns

**Carol's incentives:**
- **Good news:** Share it enthusiastically to increase the sale price
- **Bad news:** Hide it to prevent price reduction or deal collapse
- **Information asymmetry:** Carol knows about side effects; Buyer doesn't

**The fundamental problem:** Carol has a strong incentive to be selective about what she shares.

### B. Can Carol Lie or Omit Bad News?

**Can Carol lie? NO - legally she cannot make false statements.**

**Can Carol omit bad news? This is more complicated.**

**In arms-length negotiations:**
- Generally, no duty to disclose unfavorable information
- Silence is not fraud (unless there's a duty to speak)
- "Caveat emptor" (buyer beware) applies

**But there are important exceptions:**

1. **If Carol makes partial disclosures:** She must disclose the whole truth, not half-truths
   - Example: If she mentions clinical trials, she must disclose both the cure AND the side effects
   - Half-truths can be actionable as misleading

2. **If Buyer specifically asks:** Carol must answer truthfully
   - Lying in response to a direct question is fraud
   - "Any side effects?" → Must disclose

3. **Due diligence requests:** If Buyer requests clinical trial data, Carol must provide it without material omission

4. **Statutory requirements:** SEC filings, FDA reports, etc. may require disclosure

5. **Contractual obligations:** The acquisition agreement will require representations about the drug

**Key insight:** In negotiations, silence about bad news is often permitted - but once you start talking, you must tell the whole truth.

### C. Legal Liability for Refusing to Share - Buyer's Assumptions

**Does Carol face legal liability for refusing to share ANY information about trials? NO.**

- Carol can generally refuse to provide information
- Silence is not fraud (absent a duty to disclose)
- She can say "We're not sharing the clinical trials"

**What will Doug assume if Carol refuses?**

- **The worst:** Doug will assume the trials are bad
- **Asymmetric information works both ways:** If Carol won't share, Buyer assumes hidden problems
- **The "lemons" insight:** When sellers withhold information, buyers assume it's because the information is unfavorable

**This is Gilson's key insight:** Sellers have an incentive to share information - even bad information - because withholding signals that the information must be even worse than it probably is.

### D. Seller's Incentive to Share Bad News

**YES - sellers DO have an incentive to share bad news.**

**Why?**

1. **The inference problem:** If you withhold information, Buyer assumes it's terrible. By sharing bad news, you prevent Buyer from imagining something even worse.

2. **Price accuracy:** Bad news is already reflected in the fair price. Hiding it doesn't change reality - it just leads to mispricing.

3. **Deal completion:** If Buyer discovers hidden bad news later, the deal collapses. Full disclosure upfront gets the deal done at the right price.

4. **Reputation:** Honesty about problems builds trust for this and future deals.

5. **Negotiation leverage:** Controlling how bad news is disclosed is better than having Buyer discover it on their own.

**Example:**
- Trial shows drug works but has mild side effects
- If Carol shares: Price reflects this reality (maybe $10M instead of $15M)
- If Carol hides: Buyer assumes worst (maybe offers $5M) or deal falls apart later
- **Sharing bad news leads to better outcomes for everyone**

### E. Neutral Reasons for Non-Disclosure

**Does the answer change if Carol has a neutral excuse? NO - the incentive problem remains.**

**Neutral reasons Carol might give:**
- "The trials are confidential business information"
- "We're still analyzing the data"
- "Our lawyers advise us not to share pre-publication data"
- "We're concerned about trade secrets"

**Buyer's problem:**
- Is Carol really concerned about confidentiality, or is she hiding terrible results?
- **Buyer can't tell the real reason** (this is the core of asymmetric information!)

**Does this solve Carol's problem? NO.**
- From Buyer's perspective, any excuse might be a cover for bad results
- The inference problem persists: "They say it's confidential, but maybe it's just really bad"
- Carol's neutral excuse doesn't overcome the suspicion created by withholding

**Key insight:** Information asymmetry means Buyer can't distinguish between good reasons and bad reasons for withholding. So withholding still triggers the worst assumptions.

### F. Carol's Regret - Competitor Concerns

**Why Carol might regret sharing trials even if they're positive:**

1. **Competitor learning:** If Carol shows Buyer the clinical trials and the deal doesn't close, Buyer (a competitor) now has valuable information about Carol's research

2. **Strategic disadvantage:** The trials might reveal:
   - Carol's research methods
   - The drug's mechanism of action
   - Expected timeline to market
   - Dosage information

3. **Free riding:** Buyer could use Carol's research to develop their own competing drug

4. **Lost competitive edge:** Information that gives Carol an advantage would be lost

**Does this give Carol a strategy? YES - "Competitive confidentiality"**

Carol can say:
- "We're not sharing the trials because you're a competitor"
- "If the deal doesn't close, we don't want you having our proprietary research"
- "This is about competitive protection, not about hiding bad results"

**Is this credible?**
- Yes - this is a legitimate business concern
- It provides a neutral explanation for withholding
- It doesn't necessarily signal bad news

**But:** Buyer still can't be 100% sure this is the real reason - it could be an excuse for terrible results. However, this explanation is more credible than vague confidentiality claims.

### G. Buyer's Problem - Multiple Reasons Withholding

**Can Buyer tell the real reason? NO.**

**Buyer's dilemma:**
- Carol could be withholding because:
  1. The trials show terrible side effects (bad)
  2. The trials show great results but Carol fears competitive harm (neutral)
  3. Some other reason

**Buyer cannot distinguish between these reasons** - that's the essence of asymmetric information!

**What can Buyer do in response?**

1. **Offer more money:** Increase the price enough to compensate for the risk
2. **Contingent payment:** Structure payment to depend on future performance
   - Pay now, more later if drug succeeds
   - Shifts risk to Carol (who knows the truth)
3. **Strong representations & warranties:** Require Carol to warrant that there are no undisclosed material side effects
   - If she lies, she's liable
   - If she refuses to warrant, assume the worst
4. **Access with confidentiality agreement:** Offer strong protections against competitive use
5. **Engagement letter:** Bring in a neutral third-party doctor to review trials under confidentiality
6. **Walk away:** If the information gap is too large and can't be bridged, don't do the deal

**Key insight:** When information is too costly or risky to obtain, the solution is to allocate the RISK to the party with the information. Contingent payments and warranties are the tools.

---

## Question 7: Gilson's Truthfulness Thesis

**Gilson says parties have the incentive to be truthful in due diligence. Do you agree?**

**Generally YES - but with important limits.**

**Why Gilson is right:**

1. **The inference from silence:** Withholding unfavorable information signals that it must be even worse than it probably is

2. **Price efficiency:** Truthful disclosure leads to accurate pricing, which benefits both parties

3. **Deal completion:** Discovering hidden problems later kills deals; honesty upfront saves time and money

4. **Reputation:** Dealing in good position creates reputation for future deals

5. **Legal liability:** Misrepresentations create liability; truthfulness avoids this risk

**Where Gilson's thesis has limits:**

1. **Proprietary costs:** Disclosing information might help competitors (as with Carol's clinical trials)

2. **Prediction uncertainty:** Sharing forward-looking information creates legal risk if predictions prove wrong

3. **Partial disclosure:** Parties might share only favorable information while remaining silent on unfavorable aspects

4. **Strategic ambiguity:** Sometimes being vague is advantageous

5. **One-time transactions:** If seller doesn't plan to do another deal, reputation matters less

**Overall assessment:** Gilson is fundamentally right that the STRUCTURE of acquisitions creates incentives for truthful disclosure. But these incentives operate within limits - there are real reasons parties sometimes withhold or qualify information.

## Question 8: Information Production Cost Allocation

**Carol's dilemma:**
- Have her lawyers write up litigation description: Costs Carol $10,000
- Let Buyer's lawyers come read files: Costs Buyer $50,000

**What should Carol do?**

**Carol should have her lawyers write up the description ($10,000).**

**Why?**

1. **Total cost minimization:** $10,000 < $50,000 - this is the cheaper option overall

2. **Price impact:** Purchase price = Amount to seller + Buyer's transaction costs
   - If Buyer spends $50,000 on due diligence, that's $50,000 less available for the purchase price
   - If Carol spends $10,000, that's only $10,000 less for the purchase price
   - **Carol is $40,000 better off if she produces the information**

3. **Information control:** Carol's lawyers know the details and can present them accurately

4. **Efficiency:** Carol's lawyers can produce the information more cheaply than Buyer's lawyers can gather it

**This is Gilson's key insight:** The party who can produce information most cheaply should do so, because transaction costs come out of the total deal value. Minimizing total information costs benefits both parties.

---

## Question 9: Cost of Disclosure and Price Adjustment

**Gilson says:** If a party makes due diligence more expensive, they can be made to pay through purchase price adjustment.

**Do you agree? Generally YES, but it may not always work in practice.**

**Why Gilson is right in theory:**

1. **Economic logic:**
   - Total value = Purchase price + Transaction costs
   - If Seller increases Buyer's due diligence costs by $100,000
   - Rational Buyer reduces price by $100,000 to compensate
   - Seller bears the cost of their own uncooperativeness

2. **Market discipline:** Sellers who are difficult in due diligence get lower offers or lose deals entirely

3. **Negotiation leverage:** Buyer can say "Your information production is so expensive that we're reducing our price"

**Why it might not work in practice:**

1. **Information asymmetry about costs:** Buyer might not know how much it SHOULD cost to produce information. Seller might say "This is really hard and expensive" when it's actually cheap.

2. **Strategic behavior:** Seller might withhold information hoping Buyer won't recognize the cost or won't walk away

3. **Power imbalances:** If Seller has multiple bidders and Buyer has few alternatives, Seller might not face price pressure

4. **Deal momentum:** Once parties are deep in negotiations, Buyer might not walk away over increased due diligence costs

5. **Diffuse costs:** Due diligence costs are spread across many areas; linking specific costs to price reductions can be difficult

6. **Holdout problems:** Some information is uniquely known to Seller; if Seller won't produce it, Buyer can't get it elsewhere

**Overall:** Gilson's theory is sound economics, but real-world frictions and information asymmetries sometimes prevent perfect price adjustment for uncooperative behavior.

## Question 10: Third Party Experts

### A. Role of Accountants in Acquisitions

**Accountants serve several critical functions:**

1. **Financial due diligence:**
   - Verify the accuracy of financial statements
   - Analyze quality of earnings (are earnings sustainable?)
   - Review accounting policies and practices
   - Identify financial risks and irregularities

2. **Tax analysis:**
   - Review tax returns and identify potential liabilities
   - Assess tax consequences of deal structure (asset vs. stock)
   - Identify tax opportunities and risks

3. **Asset valuation:**
   - Determine fair market value of assets
   - Assess inventory valuation
   - Evaluate intangible assets (goodwill, patents, trademarks)

4. **Working capital analysis:**
   - Assess cash flow needs
   - Analyze accounts receivable and payable
   - Evaluate working capital requirements post-acquisition

5. **"Comfort letters":**
   - Provide assurance about financial information
   - Give Buyer confidence in the financials

**Key point:** Accountants bring specialized expertise to verify the financial health and accuracy of the target's business.

### B. Investment Bankers and Fairness Opinions

**Role of investment bankers:**

1. **Valuation:**
   - Determine fair value of the target company
   - Use various methodologies (comparable companies, DCF, precedent transactions)
   - Provide valuation ranges rather than precise numbers

2. **Deal structuring:**
   - Advise on optimal deal structure
   - Help negotiate price and terms
   - Design transaction to achieve tax and financial objectives

3. **Financing:**
   - Arrange debt and equity financing for the acquisition
   - Connect Buyer with lenders and investors

4. **Fairness opinions:**
   - A formal opinion stating whether the proposed price is "fair" from a financial perspective
   - Typically provided to the board of directors to help them fulfill their fiduciary duties
   - Protects directors from shareholder lawsuits claiming they sold too cheaply or paid too much

**What is a fairness opinion?**

A **fairness opinion** is a professional assessment by an investment bank stating that the financial terms of a transaction (merger, acquisition, buyout) are fair to the shareholders from a financial point of view.

**Purpose of fairness opinions:**
- Protect directors from liability
- Provide objective assessment to shareholders
- Support the recommended price
- Demonstrate that directors fulfilled their fiduciary duties

**Critique:** Fairness opinions are often criticized because:
- The investment bank is paid by the company, creating potential conflicts
- The bank may want to please the client to get future business
- The opinion is based on assumptions that can be manipulated
- Different banks might reach different conclusions

### C. Lawyers Vouching for Deal Aspects

**YES - lawyers frequently vouch for aspects of a deal through legal opinions.**

**What lawyers vouch for (in "opinions of counsel"):**

1. **Corporate validity:** The company is properly formed and exists

2. **Authorization:** The transaction has been properly authorized by the board and shareholders

3. **Good standing:** The company is in good standing under state law

4. **No violations:** The company is not violating laws (to the extent specified)

5. **Contract enforceability:** The acquisition agreement is legally binding and enforceable

6. **Litigation:** disclose pending or threatened litigation

7. **Contract assumptions:** Whether contracts can be assigned or assumed without consent

8. **Intellectual property:** Ownership and validity of patents, trademarks, copyrights

9. **Employment matters:** Status of employment agreements, benefit plans, etc.

**Why lawyers provide opinions:**
- Buyer's lender often requires them as a condition to financing
- Provides assurance that legal aspects are sound
- Allocates risk - if lawyer's opinion is wrong and lawyer was negligent, lawyer may be liable
- Information production function (Gilson's point) - lawyer is cheapest producer of this legal information

### D. Temptation to Overstate and Constraints

**Why experts might be tempted to overstate:**

1. **Financial incentives:**
   - Paid by the client, so incentive to please the client
   - Want to get hired for future work
   - Fairness opinion: Bank might want the deal to happen to earn future fees

2. **Deal pressure:**
   - Client wants a "clean" report
   - Everyone wants the deal to close
   - Being the "deal killer" is unpopular

3. **Conflicts of interest:**
   - Investment bank might do other business with the company
   - Law firm might want to be retained for future work
   - Accounting firm might provide other services (audit, tax)

4. **Reputational concerns:**
   - Being too aggressive might damage reputation in the short term (client unhappy)
   - But being too lax damages reputation in the long term (if problems emerge)

**What stops them from overstating:**

1. **Legal liability:**
   - Lawyers can be sued for malpractice for negligent opinions
   - Accountants can be sued for false financial opinions
   - "Gatekeeper" liability has increased after corporate scandals (Enron, WorldCom)

2. **Professional standards:**
   - Bar associations impose ethical obligations on lawyers
   - AICPA and SEC impose standards on accountants
   - FINRA regulates investment bankers

3. **Reputational risk:**
   - If an expert vouches for something that proves false, their reputation suffers
   - Other clients won't trust them
   - Long-term reputation cost exceeds short-term gain from one deal

4. **Market discipline:**
   - Sophisticated parties (private equity, public companies) do their own analysis
   - Other experts might be brought in to review
   - If one expert is known for giving "easy" opinions, their opinions become less valuable

5. **Insurance requirements:**
   - Law firms carry malpractice insurance
   - Insurance companies might refuse to cover reckless opinions
   - Insurers might impose conditions on what opinions can be given

**Key insight:** While there are incentives to please clients, professional discipline, legal liability, and long-term reputation concerns create countervailing forces that encourage (though don't guarantee) honest assessments.

## Question 16: Land Acquisition with Zoning Risk

### A. Sue Not in a Hurry - Cleanest Approach

**The cleanest approach: Make the sale contingent on zoning approval.**

**Structure:**
1. **Sign purchase agreement now** with a zoning contingency
2. **Zoning contingency states:** If zoning approval is not obtained by [date], Buyer can walk away
3. **Price set at $10 million** (the value if zoning is approved)
4. **Closing occurs after** zoning approval is obtained

**Why this is clean:**
- Clear allocation: Sue bears no risk if zoning fails
- Ben knows exactly what he's getting: either the land with zoning approval, or he walks away
- No complex pricing formulas
- Simple and straightforward

**Alternative: Escrow and holdback**
- Ben pays $7 million now
- Additional $3 million held in escrow
- Released when zoning is approved
- But this is more complex than the contingency approach

### B. Sue Is in a Hurry - Alternative Approaches

**If Sue needs money now and is flexible on price, here are options:**

**Option 1: Lower fixed price (Ben bears the risk)**
- Price: $9.8 million (slightly below $10M to account for risk)
- Ben pays full amount now
- Ben bears zoning risk (if zoning fails, he loses)
- Sue gets her money immediately
- **Sue gives up some upside for speed and certainty**

**Option 2: Contingent payment with premium**
- Ben pays $7 million now (certain value)
- Additional $3.5 million paid IF zoning approved (premium for risk)
- Total potential: $10.5 million
- Sue gets certainty now, Ben gets upside if zoning succeeds
- **Sue trades immediate certainty for slightly higher total potential**

**Option 3: Ben purchases an option**
- Ben pays Sue $X now for an option to purchase at $10 million
- Option expires after zoning decision
- If zoning approved, Ben exercises option and pays $10 million
- If zoning denied, Ben loses option payment but not full purchase price
- **Sue gets some money now; Ben has time to resolve zoning**

**Key trade-off:**
- **Certainty now (Sue bears no risk):** Lower price
- **Risk-sharing (contingent payment):** Higher total potential but delayed
- **Full risk to Ben:** Highest price to Sue

## Question 11: Bus Defect - No Representations

### A. Who Should Win Based on Contract Language?

**SELLER should win the lawsuit.**

**The contract language is very clear:**

1. **"Buyer has made a lengthy, detailed, and independent investigation"**
   - Buyer had the opportunity to inspect
   - Buyer chose not to find the defect

2. **"Seller has not finished testing the new bus"**
   - Seller disclosed that testing was incomplete
   - Buyer was on notice that there might be undiscovered problems

3. **"Seller shall continue to give Buyer access to inspect the new bus"**
   - Seller provided access for Buyer to investigate
   - Buyer had the opportunity but didn't discover the defect

4. **"Neither party is relying upon any warranty or representation...not fully set forth in this agreement"**
   - No representations about defects
   - No warranties about testing
   - Buyer agreed to rely on its own investigation

5. **The agreement does not have any other representations about possible defects**
   - No promises about the bus being defect-free
   - No obligation to disclose test results

**Key legal principle:** **Caveat emptor** (buyer beware) - where the contract explicitly disclaims reliance on representations and the buyer had the opportunity to inspect, the buyer bears the risk of undiscovered defects.

**Buyer's claim that Seller "should have told" fails because:**
- Contract says Buyer made "independent investigation"
- Contract says no reliance on representations not in writing
- Buyer had access to inspect but chose not to discover the defect

### B. If Seller Wins - Are We Rewarding Sneakiness?

**This feels like rewarding sneakiness, but it's more complex.**

**Arguments that we're rewarding sneakiness:**
- Seller knew about the defect and didn't disclose
- Seller remained silent while Buyer proceeded unaware
- Seller benefits from its own silence

**Counterarguments:**

1. **Contractual allocation of risk:**
   - The parties explicitly agreed that Buyer would investigate
   - The contract allocated the risk of undiscovered defects to Buyer
   - Buyer accepted this allocation by signing

2. **Buyer had opportunity to discover:**
   - Seller gave Buyer access to inspect
   - The defect was discoverable if Buyer had looked
   - Buyer chose not to inspect thoroughly (or inspected poorly)

3. **Seller's partial disclosure:**
   - Seller disclosed that testing was incomplete
   - This put Buyer on notice that there might be problems
   - Buyer proceeded anyway

4. **Economic efficiency:**
   - Buyer is in better position to evaluate the bus's value to itself
   - Buyer is the one who will use the buses and knows its needs
   - Allocating investigation responsibility to Buyer might be efficient

**But still:** There's something troubling about allowing a seller who knows about a defect to remain silent.

### C. If Buyer Wins - Are We Rewarding Carelessness?

**YES - if Buyer wins, we're rewarding carelessness.**

**Why Buyer was careless:**

1. **Had inspection rights but didn't use them effectively:**
   - Contract gave Buyer access to inspect
   - Buyer could have discovered the defect with proper inspection
   - Buyer failed to find what was discoverable

2. **Contract allocated responsibility to Buyer:**
   - "Buyer has made...independent investigation"
   - Buyer agreed to rely on its own investigation, not Seller's representations
   - Buyer is now trying to shift responsibility back to Seller

3. **Buyer is a sophisticated party:**
   - Buyer is a big company that makes buses
   - Buyer knows how to inspect buses
   - Buyer is in the business and should know what to look for

4. **Market discipline argument:**
   - If Buyer wins, future buyers won't bother to inspect carefully
   - They can just sue later saying "You should have told me"
   - This undermines the whole inspection process

**The economic problem:** If courts protect careless buyers who had the opportunity to inspect, it reduces incentives for buyers to do due diligence. This increases transaction costs for everyone.

### D. Language Buyer Should Have Asked For

**Buyer should have asked for:**

1. **Representations about testing:**
   - "Seller represents that all tests conducted to date show no material defects"
   - "Seller represents that Seller is not aware of any defects in the bus design"

2. **Representations about the bus:**
   - "The bus conforms to Seller's standard specifications"
   - "There are no known defects that would materially affect the bus's performance"

3. **Disclosure obligation:**
   - "Seller represents that Seller has disclosed to Buyer all test results and known defects"
   - "Seller represents that Seller is not aware of any defects not disclosed to Buyer"

4. **Indemnification for defects:**
   - "Seller shall indemnify Buyer for any defects in the bus known to Seller and not disclosed"

5. **Conditions to closing:**
   - "Buyer's obligation to close is subject to Buyer's satisfaction with inspection results"
   - "Buyer may terminate this agreement if inspection reveals material defects"

6. **No reliance on inspection clause:**
   - DELETE the clause that says Buyer made independent investigation
   - OR qualify it: "except for defects known to Seller and not disclosed"

**Key insight:** When drafting acquisition agreements, representations and warranties allocate the risk of undiscovered problems. Buyer wanted Seller to bear this risk but agreed to contract language that put the risk on Buyer. This is a drafting failure, not just a legal fairness issue.

**The lesson:** The parties allocated the risk of undiscovered defects to Buyer through their contract. The court is enforcing that allocation, not deciding whether it's fair. The solution is better contracting, not judicial intervention.

## Key Takeaways

### The Three Core Problems Revisited

1. **Information Asymmetry:** Seller knows more than Buyer about the target business

2. **Solutions to Asymmetric Information:**
   - **Due diligence:** Buyer investigates to verify and discover information
   - **Representations & warranties:** Seller makes legally accountable statements about the business
   - **Access:** Seller provides access to documents and information
   - **Third-party verification:** Accountants, lawyers, consultants verify information
   - **Opinions of counsel:** Lawyers provide legal analysis and assurance

3. **Cost Minimization Principle (Gilson's Insight):**
   - Information should be produced by whoever can do it most cheaply
   - Total deal value = Purchase price + Transaction costs
   - Minimizing information costs benefits both parties
   - This creates cooperative incentives in due diligence

### Deal Structure Matters

**Asset Deals vs. Stock Deals:**

| Issue | Asset Deal | Stock Deal |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| What Buyer gets | Specific assets and liabilities | Entire corporation (all assets AND all liabilities) |
| Third-party consents | Often required (leases, contracts) | Generally not required |
| Unknown liabilities | Generally not inherited | Inherited |
| Tax liabilities of Seller | Usually stay with seller | Buyer inherits |
| Due diligence focus | Specific assets being acquired | Entire corporation |
| Continuity of business | May be disrupted | Preserved |

### The Lawyer's Role in Acquisitions

1. **Information Production:**
   - Representations & warranties compel Seller to produce information
   - Lawyers interpret legal documents and assess legal status
   - Opinions of counsel provide specialized legal information

2. **Risk Allocation:**
   - Indemnification provisions allocate risk of breach
   - Survival periods determine how long representations last
   - Escrow holdbacks provide security for claims

3. **Deal Structuring:**
   - Asset vs. stock decisions have legal and tax implications
   - Contingent payments allocate risk based on future outcomes
   - Conditions to closing protect against undiscovered problems

4. **Verification:**
   - Legal review of contracts, litigation, regulatory compliance
   - Third-party opinions provide assurance
   - Due diligence investigation identifies risks

### Key Economic Insights

1. **The Cooperative Nature of Due Diligence:**
   - Both parties benefit from reducing information asymmetry
   - Seller shares information because withholding signals even worse news
   - Efficient information production maximizes total deal value

2. **When Cooperation Fails:**
   - Proprietary costs (competitor concerns)
   - Prediction uncertainty (forward-looking information)
   - Strategic behavior (one-time transactions)

3. **Risk Allocation as Fallback:**
   - When information is too costly to produce, allocate risk
   - Contingent payments shift risk to party with better information
   - Representations & warranties create legal accountability

4. **"Make or Buy" Decisions:**
   - Vertical integration (owning both stages) solves contracting problems
   - But comes with costs: less flexibility, higher fixed costs
   - Arms-length transactions work when you can write complete contracts
   - Incomplete contracts + reputation concerns can sustain market transactions

### Critical Distinctions

1. **Past Facts vs. Future Predictions:**
   - Past facts: Easier to share, less legal risk
   - Future predictions: Speculative, more legal risk, harder to verify

2. **Due Diligence vs. Insurance:**
   - Due diligence addresses information asymmetry (buyer can inspect)
   - Insurance addresses risk allocation (who bears the cost if something goes wrong)
   - Don't confuse the two!

3. **Legal Duty vs. Voluntary Disclosure:**
   - Generally no duty to disclose unfavorable information in negotiations
   - But once you start talking, you must tell the whole truth (no half-truths)
   - Silence is permitted; lying is not
   - Representations create legal duties to tell the truth

### The Bus Case Lesson

**Poor drafting can allocate risk disastrously.**

Buyer wanted Seller to bear the risk of undiscovered defects but agreed to contract language that:
- Disclaimed reliance on representations
- Stated Buyer made independent investigation
- Gave Buyer access to inspect but Buyer failed to discover the defect
- Did not require Seller to disclose known defects

**Result:** Buyer bears the risk of its own careless inspection, not Seller's dishonesty.

**Lesson:** Contract language matters. Careful drafting of representations, warranties, and due diligence provisions is essential to proper risk allocation.

## Notes for Class Discussion

- **Think about the economics** behind legal rules, not just the black letter law
- **Consider incentives:** What behavior does each rule or contract provision encourage?
- **Gilson's cooperative model** is powerful but has limits - be ready to discuss when it works and when it doesn't
- **Asset vs. stock deal structure** is a fundamental choice with huge implications - understand the trade-offs
- **Representations & warranties** serve both an information-production function and a risk-allocation function
- **Third-party opinions** (lawyers, accountants, investment bankers) play critical roles but have potential conflicts
- **The bus case** is a great example of how contract drafting allocates risk - think about what each party should have done differently
- **Vertical integration** vs. arms-length contracting is a recurring theme - when does it make sense to own vs. buy?
