**Discussion Questions \# 4 (Panel 3)**

**Corporate Acquisitions: Due Diligence as a Response to Asymmetric
Information**

1\. Steve runs a company called Orange, which makes computers, phones,
and other consumer electronics products. Steve's goal is to distinguish
the company by offering unique features and reliable, high-quality
products. He wants to make sure the company's products look, feel, and
really are different. In addition to the hardware, he believes they need
to have an operating system and other software that are different from
what other companies use.

A.  You are Steve's lawyer. He is considering forming a contract with a
    software developer, asking them to develop an innovative operating
    system. He asks you to draft a contract. You ask him to define what
    he's looking for and he says, "It has to be unique and innovative."
    You ask him to be more specific, and he says, "It has to be really
    good, creative, and different."' What advice do you give him? Is a
    contract going to be effective in policing the quality standards
    Steve has in mind?

B.  Aside from a contract, do software developers have other (not
    legally- enforceable) reasons to want to impress Steve?

C.  If Steve can't rely on a contract or on non-legal reasons to ensure
    that the software is innovative and high quality, what else can
    Steve do? Do you see a reason why the business of making software
    might be paired with another business, so that the same owners own
    both?

D.  What is "vertical integration"? What economic problems is it
    designed to solve? Have you heard the phrase "make or buy decision"?

2\. Assume that Jim runs a law firm. He has 40 associates, but he has
more work than they can do. Carla approaches Jim with the following
idea: she runs an agency that can provide Jim with lawyers who take
"freelance" assignments, which means they will come work temporarily for
Jim (e.g., for a day or a few hours) to help with a specific assignment.
They can help Jim draft a specific contract or motion or a will. Once
they are done, they no longer work for Jim.

A.  What might Jim like about this idea?

B.  Why might Jim hesitate to do this?

C.  What else might Jim do if he has too much work? What are the
    benefits and costs of this alternative, compared with the idea
    described above?

3\. What is "due diligence"? What problem is it supposed to solve?
(Hint: It's a fundamental theme of this course.) How does a buyer know
that a seller is telling the truth when the seller provides information?

4\. Due diligence---and, more fundamentally, the information a buyer
wants---can vary with the deal structure. Assume that a company called
"Buyer" wants to acquire a business called "Seller" for cash. Buyer can
either buy the assets of Seller (an "asset deal") or Buyer can by the
stock of Seller (a "stock deal").

A.  As a logistical matter, what is the difference between an asset and
    a stock deal? What, specifically, is Buyer buying in each case?

B.  Assume Seller did not properly file a patent. Does Buyer need to
    worry about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock deal?

C.  Assume Seller has a cheap lease, but if Seller is no longer the
    counterparty on the lease, it expires. Does Buyer need to worry
    about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock deal?

D.  Assume Seller has not paid its taxes for three years. Does Buyer
    need to worry about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock
    deal?

E.  Assume that one of Seller's employees made inappropriate jokes in
    the workplace, and Seller just terminated his employment. Does Buyer
    need to worry about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock
    deal?

F.  Assume Buyer has not paid its taxes for three years. Does Seller
    need to worry about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock
    deal?

G.  Assume Buyer is buying a drug patent from Seller. There is
    uncertainty about whether the drug will work, so Buyer is paying a
    first installment now, and will pay another amount in two years. The
    amount of this payment will depend on whether the drug works. Assume
    also that Buyer has not paid its taxes for three years. Does Seller
    need to worry about this in an asset deal? What about in a stock
    deal?

5\. Seller is negotiating to sell a theme park to Buyer. It used to be
very popular, but lately it has not been drawing the same crowds. Seller
has built a new ride, based on a popular videogame, which will be the
subject of a movie that will be released after the sale closes. Seller
has produced the game for many years, and also is producing the move.
The ride won't open until after the movie opens---and, therefore, until
after the sale.

A. Buyer asks for information about the game, including the number of
users over the past several years. Why do you think Buyer wants this
information? Do you think Seller should provide it?

B. Ron Gilson has argued that due diligence should be a cooperative
process, since the parties have shared interests. Does the example in
"A" support his view?

C. Buyer asks for information about the movie (which, again, has not
been released), including information about the reaction of focus groups
who have seen it. Why do you think Buyer wants this information? Why
might Seller be more concerned about addressing Buyer's questions about
the movie? (Hint: is there a difference between offering facts, on the
one hand, and predictions, on the other?)

D. Does "C" support or undercut Gilson's claim that due diligence should
be a cooperative process?

6\. Carol is an entrepreneur who is developing a cure for the common
cold. She would like to sell her company, Seller, to Buyer, a
pharmaceutical company. Doug, who works for Buyer, wants to see the
clinical trials for the new drug. Carol knows that the results are
mixed. They suggest that the drug does cure colds, but they also suggest
that the drug may have some serious side-effects.

A.  Without any legal constraints, what would Carol (or, indeed, an
    unethical version of Carol) want to say about the trials? Does she
    have an incentive to share good news? What about bad news?

B.  Can Carol simply share the good news ("the drug cures colds") but
    lie about or omit the bad news (serious side-effects)?

C.  Does Carol face any legal liability if she simply refuses to share
    any information about the trials? If Carol refuses, what will Doug
    assume about the trials?

D.  Given your answer to C, do sellers have an incentive to share bad
    news, as well as good news?

E.  In principle, would your answer to "D" change if a seller is able to
    offer a justification for not to share information, which has
    nothing to do with the fact that this information might not be
    flattering?

F.  Building on "E," can you think of a reason why Carol might regret
    sharing clinical trials with Buyer (even if the trials are glowingly
    positive) if the deal does not go through? (Hint: Assume that
    Carol's company and Buyer are competitors and that the trials
    contain valuable information.) If so, does this offer Carol a
    strategy for refusing to disclose the information?

G.  If Carol has more than one reason not to disclose the trials, can
    Buyer tell what the real reason is? What, if anything, can Buyer do
    in response?

7\. Gilson says parties have the incentive to be truthful in due
diligence? Do you agree?

8\. Let's say Buyer wants to know about any litigation pending for
Carol's company. Carol can ask her lawyers, who know the details of the
litigation, to write up a description, but the time they will spend will
cost Carol \$10,000. Alternatively, Carol can invite Buyer's lawyers to
come and read the litigation files (which are quite large). If she does
this, Buyer is likely to have to pay their lawyers \$50,000. What should
Carol do?

9\. Gilson says parties have the incentive to minimize the cost of
disclosure. He says that a party that makes due diligence more expensive
can be made to pay for this through an adjustment in the purchase price.
Do you agree? Can you think of a reason why this might not happen?

10\. Third Party Experts

a.  What role do accountants play in acquisitions?

b.  What about investment bankers? Do you know what a "fairness opinion"
    is?

c.  Do lawyers ever vouch for aspects of a deal?

d.  When these experts are asked to reassure the parties on particular
    issues, why (if at all) might they be tempted to overstate their
    case? What (if anything) stops them from doing so?

> 16\. Ben Buyer owns a plot of land. He is considering buying a
> neighboring plot from Sue Seller. Ben wants to combine the two plots
> and build a skyscraper. He is concerned, though, that he won't be able
> to get approval from the zoning board. If Ben can combine the two
> plots, he's willing to pay \$10 million for Sue's plot. If he can't,
> he's only willing to pay \$7 million. It's very likely that the zoning
> board will approve Ben's request, but the process takes time.

a.  Assume that Sue is not in a hurry. What do you think is the cleanest
    way for the parties to proceed?

b.  Assume that Sue actually is in a hurry and is flexible on the price.
    You represent her. What suggestion do you have to help her get the
    deal done?

> 11\. Seller, a start-up company, is developing a new type of bus,
> which is supposed to be more fuel efficient. Seller has developed a
> design, and has made a few of the new buses in order to test them, but
> has not yet begun delivering buses to customers. New York City has
> ordered 10,000 of these buses, but no buses have been delivered yet.
> Buyer is a big company that makes buses, and wants the New York City
> contract.
>
> Seller has begun testing the buses, and has discovered a problem with
> the wheels, which may be expensive to fix. Seller has not yet finished
> testing the buses.
>
> The agreement has the following language: "Buyer has made a lengthy,
> detailed, and independent investigation regarding the design and
> specifications of the new bus," and \"Seller has not finished testing
> the new bus." The agreement also says that "Seller shall continue to
> give Buyer access to inspect the new bus" and that \"neither party is
> relying upon any warranty or representation of the other not fully set
> forth in this agreement.\" The agreement does not have any other
> representations about possible defects in the bus or about the tests
> Seller has been conducting.
>
> After the deal closes and Buyer discovers the defect in the new bus,
> Buyer sues, claiming that Seller should have told Buyer about the
> defect.

a.  If you are the judge, and you have to decide the case based only on
    the contract language quoted above, who do you think should win the
    lawsuit?

b.  If you decide that Seller wins, are you rewarding sneakiness?

c.  If you decide that Buyer wins, are you rewarding carelessness?

d.  What language should Buyer have asked for in the agreement in order
    to avoid this problem?
