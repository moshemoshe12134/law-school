# Class 5 Prep Sheet: Representations, Covenants, Conditions, and MAC Clauses

**Course:** Deals
**Topic:** Corporate Acquisitions - Contractual Protections in M&A
**Date:** Spring Semester 2026

---

## Key Concepts Overview

This class focuses on the **three main contractual mechanisms** in acquisition agreements - **representations, covenants, and conditions** - and the critical role of **Material Adverse Change (MAC) clauses** in allocating risk between buyers and sellers.

Key themes include:
- **Representations** - statements of fact about the business
- **Covenants** - promises to do or not do certain things
- **Conditions** - requirements that must be met before closing
- **Materiality qualifiers** - limiting obligations to "material" items
- **Knowledge qualifiers** - limiting obligations to what the seller knows
- **MAC clauses** - allowing buyers to back out if the business deteriorates
- **COVID-19 case studies** - how MAC clauses and other provisions operate in practice

**The core insight:** Acquisition agreements are complex risk allocation devices. Every provision represents a choice about who bears which risk. The negotiation of these provisions is about information production, incentive alignment, and allocating risk to the party best able to bear it.

## Question 1: Representations, Covenants, and Conditions - The Difference

### The Three Core Contractual Mechanisms

**1. Representations (Statements of Fact)**
- Statements about the business that are supposed to be true
- Examples: "The company has no undisclosed liabilities" or "The company is in good standing"
- If false, buyer can sue for breach
- Primary function: **Information production** - compels seller to share what they know

**2. Covenants (Promises)**
- Promises to do (or not do) something in the future
- Examples: "Seller will operate the business in the ordinary course" or "Buyer will use best efforts to obtain financing"
- If breached, buyer can sue for breach
- Primary function: **Behavior control** - ensures seller acts appropriately between signing and closing

**3. Conditions (Requirements to Close)**
- Things that must happen before the parties are obligated to close
- Examples: "No MAC has occurred" or "Regulatory approval obtained"
- If not met, party can walk away without liability
- Primary function: **Risk allocation** - allows parties to back out if circumstances change

**Key distinction:**
- **Representations and covenants:** If breached, you can sue for damages (or terminate in some cases)
- **Conditions:** If not satisfied, you can walk away from the deal entirely

---

## Question 2: Classifying Contractual Language

### A. "Target is a corporation duly organized..."

**This is a REPRESENTATION.**

**Why?** It's a statement of fact about Target's current legal status. It's supposed to be true at the time it's made.

**What it does:** Asserts that Target legally exists and has the corporate power to enter into the agreement.

### B. "Each balance sheet delivered to Acquiring..."

**This is a REPRESENTATION.**

**Why?** It's a statement about the accuracy of the financial statements. It asserts that the balance sheets comply with GAAP and reflect all liabilities.

**What it does:** Provides assurance about the financial condition of the business.

### C. "During the period from the date hereof to and including the Closing, Target will conduct its business solely in the usual and ordinary manner..."

**This is a COVENANT.**

**Why?** It's a promise about future behavior. It tells Target what it must (and must not) do between signing and closing.

**What it does:** Prevents seller from taking unusual actions that would harm the business value before closing. This is called an "ordinary course covenant."

### D. "No action or proceeding before a court or any other governmental agency or body shall have been instituted or threatened to restrain or prohibit the Merger..."

**This is a CONDITION.**

**Why?** It specifies something that must (not) be true in order for the parties to be obligated to close. It's about the existence of litigation threatening the deal.

**What it does:** Gives Buyer an out if regulatory challenges or lawsuits emerge that would block the merger. If this condition isn't satisfied, Buyer can walk away.

---

## Question 3: Seller's Changes to Buyer's Representation

### The Original Representation
> "Target is not subject to any material liability by reason of a violation of any order, rule, or regulation of any Federal, state, municipal or other governmental agency."

### Seller's Changes

**Change A: Added "criminal"**
> "Target is not subject to any material liability by reason of a **criminal** violation of any order, rule, or regulation..."

**What this means:**
- Seller is now ONLY representing about criminal violations
- **Civil violations are excluded** from the representation
- Seller could have civil regulatory liabilities that aren't disclosed

**Why Seller did this:**
- Civil regulatory violations are common and often technical
- Seller doesn't want to be on the hook for discovering every minor civil violation
- Seller is limiting the scope of what must be disclosed

**What you learn:**
- Seller has something to hide regarding civil regulatory compliance
- Seller wants to limit disclosure obligations
- Buyer should assume there ARE civil violations that would matter

**Follow-up questions to ask:**
- "Why are you excluding civil violations?"
- "Are there any civil regulatory violations you're aware of?"
- "Can you provide a list of all civil regulatory inquiries or investigations?"
- "Why shouldn't we include both criminal and civil violations?"

**Change B: Changed "any governmental agency" to "any national governmental agency"**

**What this means:**
- State, municipal, and local regulatory agencies are excluded
- Only federal/national agencies are covered
- Seller could have violations at state or local level that aren't disclosed

**Why Seller did this:**
- State and local regulation is extensive
- Compliance varies widely across jurisdictions
- Seller wants to limit due diligence burden

**What you learn:**
- Seller may have state or local regulatory issues
- Seller wants to exclude these from disclosure obligations

**Follow-up questions to ask:**
- "Why are you excluding state and local agencies?"
- "Are you aware of any state or municipal regulatory issues?"
- "Have any state or local agencies investigated or sanctioned Target?"
- "What state/local regulatory bodies oversee your business?"

**Key insight:** When Seller narrows a representation, it's a signal that there's something in the excluded category. The narrower the representation, the more you should worry about what's been excluded.

## Question 4: Materiality & Knowledge Qualifiers

### A. Why Add "Material" to the Tax Representation?

**Original:** "Target has paid all taxes and assessments (including interest or penalties) owed by it..."

**With qualifier:** "Target has paid all **material** taxes and assessments..."

**Why Seller wants "material" added:**

1. **Reduce disclosure burden:** Seller doesn't have to hunt down every small tax bill

2. **Limit liability:** Small tax errors won't give Buyer a claim for breach

3. **Focus on what matters:** Small underpayments probably don't affect the business value

4. **Practical reality:** Companies often have minor tax disputes in multiple jurisdictions

5. **Cost-benefit:** It costs more to find every small tax bill than the bills are worth

**Example:**
- Company operates in 50 states
- Owes $200 in late fees in one state
- Is this worth disclosing, negotiating, and potentially litigating?
- Probably not - it's immaterial

**Key point:** "Material" allows Seller to ignore trivia and focus on significant items.

### B. Defining Materiality as $500 - The Problem

**The proposal:** Define "material" as any issue involving at least $500.

**The problem:** Materiality in the AGGREGATE matters, not just individually.

**Example of the problem:**
- Seller has 1,000 separate tax bills of $400 each
- Each one is "immaterial" under the $500 definition
- But in aggregate, that's $400,000!
- Buyer would be unprotected for this massive liability

**How to deal with this problem:**

1. **Include aggregate language:**
   > "No single undisclosed item exceeds $500, and the aggregate of all such items does not exceed $50,000"

2. **Use a "basket" or "cushion":**
   - Seller is only liable for losses above a threshold amount
   - Buyer absorbs the first $X of losses
   - This addresses the aggregation problem

3. **Be careful about "de minimis" vs. "material":**
   - A dollar threshold is one approach
   - But consider both individual and aggregate impact

**Key insight:** Materiality can't be reduced to a simple dollar threshold. Many small items can add up to something very material.

### C. "To the Best of My Knowledge" - Land Ownership

**The representation:** "To the best of my knowledge, I am the legal owner of this land."

**As Buyer's lawyer, am I comfortable? NO.**

**Why this is problematic:**

1. **Knowledge qualifiers create ambiguity:**
   - What does Seller actually know?
   - What should Seller have known?
   - Did Seller investigate title properly?

2. **Defeats the purpose:**
   - Buyer wants assurance about title
   - If Seller didn't bother to check, "to the best of my knowledge" provides no protection

3. **Title is objectively verifiable:**
   - Title can be searched in public records
   - Either Seller owns the land or doesn't
   - This is a factual question, not a matter of opinion

4. **Information production:**
   - Seller is in the best position to know about title issues
   - Seller should be required to investigate and warrant title
   - Shifting this risk to Buyer makes no sense

**Better approach:**
- Require Seller to warrant ownership without knowledge qualifier
- Or require title insurance
- Or make satisfactory title search a condition to closing

**Key insight:** Knowledge qualifiers make sense when the seller truly couldn't be expected to know the answer (like threatened litigation). They don't make sense for things the seller can and should verify.

### D. "To the Best of My Knowledge" - Lawsuit Threats

**The representation:** "No one has sued our business and, to the best of our knowledge, no one is threatening to sue the business."

**As Buyer's lawyer, am I comfortable?**

**First part ("No one has sued"): YES**
- This is objectively verifiable
- Seller knows whether lawsuits exist
- This provides meaningful protection

**Second part ("to the best of our knowledge, no threats"): YES (with the knowledge qualifier)**
- This is appropriate for threatened litigation
- Seller can't know about every grumble or complaint
- People at bars don't count as "threats"
- Seller only knows about threats that have been communicated

**Why the distinction matters:**

1. **Pending lawsuits:** Seller SHOULD know these
   - Lawsuits are formal proceedings
   - Seller would have been served
   - No knowledge qualifier needed

2. **Threatened lawsuits:** Seller MIGHT not know these
   - Threats can be informal
   - Someone might complain to their lawyer but not yet sue
   - Seller can't know about every potential plaintiff
   - Knowledge qualifier is appropriate

**Key insight:** Knowledge qualifiers should be used when the seller genuinely couldn't be expected to have the information. They shouldn't be used for things the seller can and should know about.

## Question 5: False Representations

### A. When Representations Provide No Meaningful Protection

**What happens if a representation is false?**
- Buyer can sue for breach of contract
- Buyer can seek damages
- Buyer might be able to terminate the agreement

**When Buyer gets NO meaningful protection even though the representation is clearly false:**

**The problem of judgment-proof sellers:**

1. **Seller has no money:**
   - Seller sold the company and spent all the proceeds
   - Judgment-proof = no assets to satisfy a judgment
   - Buyer wins the lawsuit but collects nothing

2. **Seller disappears:**
   - Seller moves to another country
   - Seller declares bankruptcy
   - Buyer can't collect

3. **Legal costs exceed recovery:**
   - The breach caused $100,000 in damages
   - Litigation costs $150,000
   - Rational buyer won't sue

4. **Causation problems:**
   - Representation was false
   - But Buyer can't prove it caused harm
   - No recovery without causation

5. **Time and effort:**
   - Litigation takes years
   - Management attention is diverted
   - Even if you win, you lose

**Key insight:** A right to sue is meaningless if the defendant can't pay. contractual protections are only as good as the seller's ability to satisfy a judgment.

### B. How Buyer Can Plan Ahead to Prevent This

**1. Indemnification escrow (holdback):**
   - Hold back a portion of the purchase price in escrow
   - If representations prove false, money is available
   - Typical: 10-15% of price held for 1-3 years

**2. Representation & Warranty insurance:**
   - Buyer purchases insurance policy
   - Insurance company pays if representations are false
   - Transfers risk from Buyer (and Seller) to insurer
   - Increasingly common in M&A

**3. Seller financing:**
   - Seller agrees to finance part of the purchase price
   - Creates ongoing financial relationship
   - Gives Buyer leverage if there are breaches

**4. Personal guarantees:**
   - Shareholders personally guarantee the representations
   - Makes their personal assets at risk
   - Provides security beyond the corporate entity

**5. Survival periods:**
   - Representations "survive" closing for a set period
   - Buyer can bring claims during this window
   - Important representations may survive longer

**6. Thresholds and baskets:**
   - Losses must exceed a threshold before Seller must pay
   - But escrow covers losses above this threshold
   - Aligns incentives and reduces trivial claims

**7. Careful due diligence:**
   - Discover problems before closing
   - Adjust price or require fixes before closing
   - Prevention is better than remedy

### C. Why 15,000 Shares in Escrow for 42 Months?

**The language:**
> "Seller hereby agrees that at the Closing, upon receipt of the Merger Shares, he will immediately deposit 15,000 of such Merger Shares into escrow for a period ending no later than 42 months after the closing at which time the escrowed Merger Shares then remaining in escrow will be returned to him."

**What this accomplishes:**

**1. Security for breaches:**
   - 15,000 shares are set aside
   - If representations prove false, Buyer has something to recover from
   - These shares can be used to satisfy indemnification obligations

**2. Time frame for discovery:**
   - 42 months (3.5 years) is a long time
   - Many problems emerge after closing (tax issues, litigation, etc.)
   - Gives Buyer time to discover breaches
   - Typical survival periods are 12-36 months

**3. "Return to Seller" if no claims:**
   - If no claims are made, Seller gets the shares back
   - Provides Seller incentive to cooperate
   - Doesn't permanently deprive Seller of value

**4. Incentive alignment:**
   - Seller has "skin in the game" even after closing
   - Encourages Seller to be honest in representations
   - Seller bears the cost of any misrepresentations

**5. Practical protection:**
   - Even if Seller spends all the cash proceeds, the escrowed shares remain
   - These shares can be sold to satisfy claims
   - Buyer has actual security, not just a judgment

**Key insight:** Escrow is the most common and practical solution to the judgment-proof seller problem. It provides real security that survives closing.

## Question 6: Ann and Ben - Shopping Mall During Pandemic

### Why Ann Might Decide Not to Evict Ben

**The facts:**
- Ann owns a shopping mall
- Ben owns a restaurant in the mall
- Ben's lease runs through 2023
- Pandemic forced Ben to close April 1, 2020
- Ben stopped paying rent
- Lease has no pandemic exception - Ben is clearly in breach
- Ann could evict Ben

**Why Ann might NOT evict:**

**1. Economic reality:**
   - During pandemic, NO ONE would rent the space
   - The space would sit empty generating ZERO rent
   - At least Ben might pay something eventually
   - Evicting Ben doesn't solve Ann's problem

**2. Long-term relationship value:**
   - Ben was a good tenant before the pandemic
   - Ann wants Ben to remain a tenant after pandemic
   - Preserving the relationship is worth short-term rent forgiveness

**3. Replacement costs:**
   - Finding a new tenant is expensive
   - Broker commissions, build-out costs, vacancy periods
   - Keeping Ben is cheaper than finding someone new

**4. Asset preservation:**
   - An abandoned restaurant looks bad in a mall
   - One closed space hurts foot traffic for other tenants
   - Maintaining occupancy helps the mall's overall value

**5. Legal costs:**
   - Eviction takes time and money
   - Lawsuits, court proceedings, enforcement
   - Costs may exceed recoverable rent

**6. Public relations:**
   - Evicting during a pandemic looks bad
   - Community backlash
   - Damage to Ann's reputation

### Why Forgive Some Rent If Ben Agrees to Pay Later?

**1. Better than nothing:**
   - Some rent is better than no rent
   - Spreading the burden over time makes it manageable for Ben
   - Ann gets eventual payment for most of the rent

**2. Preserves the tenant:**
   - Ben stays in business
   - Lease remains in force
   - Ann has a long-term tenant after pandemic

**3. Risk allocation:**
   - Ann bears some of the pandemic risk
   - But gets paid eventually
   - Shared burden is better than total loss

**4. Flexibility:**
   - Can structure payment over time
   - Can adjust to Ben's recovery
   - Better than rigid all-or-nothing approach

### What This Tells Us About the Limits of Contracts

**1. Contracts can't allocate all risk:**
   - The lease allocated all pandemic risk to Ben
   - But this allocation proved unworkable in practice
   - Ann couldn't enforce without hurting herself

**2. Mutual dependence matters:**
   - Landlord and tenant depend on each other
   - Strict enforcement can hurt both parties
   - Sometimes flexibility is mutually beneficial

**3. External shocks:**
   - Pandemics affect everyone
   - Rigid contracts may break under extreme stress
   - Parties may need to renegotiate

**4. Reputation and relationships:**
   - Business is done with people you know
   - Long-term relationships matter more than strict enforcement
   - Goodwill is valuable

**5. Economic efficiency:**
   - Strict enforcement might be "legal" but economically wasteful
   - Evicting Ben creates lose-lose outcome
   - Flexibility creates win-win (or at least lose-less)

**Key insight:** Contracts are important, but they exist in a broader context of economic relationships, external realities, and mutual dependence. Sometimes strict enforcement is counterproductive for everyone involved.

## Question 7: C Brands and Evergreen - Pandemic MAC Dispute

### A. Carl's Actions - Evergreen's Right to Cancel?

**The facts:**
- C Brands (seller) and Evergreen (buyer) signed deal in January 2020
- MAC clause specifically CARVES OUT Covid-19 pandemic
- Covenant: "Seller will continue to operate the business in the ordinary course"
- Covenant: "Seller will not take any major actions without buyer's prior consent"

**Carl's actions:**
1. Furloughed 1,600 employees (stores legally required to close)
2. Stopped paying rent on most stores
3. Slashed employee compensation

**Do these give Evergreen the right to cancel?**

**1. Furloughing employees:**
   - **Likely NOT a breach** of the ordinary course covenant
   - Stores were legally required to close
   - Paying employees to do nothing when stores are closed is NOT ordinary course
   - This is a reasonable response to forced closure

**2. Stopping rent payments:**
   - **MIGHT be a breach** - depends on the lease terms and applicable law
   - Many leases had force majeure provisions or pandemic-related rent relief
   - If tenants were legally allowed to withhold rent, this might be ordinary course
   - But if Carl simply stopped paying without legal basis, this could be a breach

**3. Slashing compensation:**
   - **Likely NOT a breach** of ordinary course covenant
   - Extraordinary circumstances justify extraordinary measures
   - Preserving cash during crisis is reasonable
   - Many companies did this during pandemic

**Overall assessment:**
- Carl's actions seem reasonable given the circumstances
- Most courts would find this doesn't violate the ordinary course covenant
- The pandemic specifically affected retail apparel stores
- These responses were proportionate to the crisis

**Key insight:** "Ordinary course" is interpreted in context. Extraordinary circumstances justify extraordinary measures. A pandemic is not ordinary, and responses to it shouldn't be judged by ordinary standards.

### B. Merchandise Stock Argument

**Evergreen's allegation:**
> D's Secret has "drastically [reduced] new merchandise receipts which, when coupled with D's Secret's failure to dispose of existing out-of-season, obsolete and excess merchandise, has saddled the D's Secret Business with a stock of merchandise of greatly diminished value."

**Is this a winning argument? PROBABLY NOT.**

**Why this likely fails:**

1. **Covid-19 is carved out:**
   - The MAC clause specifically excludes the pandemic
   - Reduced merchandise receipts are DIRECTLY caused by pandemic
   - Store closures and supply chain disruptions are pandemic effects

2. **Ordinary course argument:**
   - During store closures, does it make sense to keep ordering new merchandise?
   - Reducing orders when stores are closed is prudent management
   - Preserving cash during crisis is reasonable

3. **Inventory problems are pandemic-related:**
   - Out-of-season inventory exists because stores were closed
   - Couldn't sell through existing inventory during normal course
   - This is a direct consequence of the pandemic

4. **Causation:**
   - Even if merchandise has "diminished value," the cause is the pandemic
   - Not a company-specific problem
   - Retailers everywhere faced this issue

**But there's a counterargument:**
- Did Carl make reasonable inventory decisions?
- Or did he fail to take appropriate steps to preserve value?
- Could merchandise have been sold online at a discount?
- This turns on whether Carl's decisions were reasonable

**Overall:** This is a weak argument for Evergreen because the core problem (bad merchandise) is directly caused by the pandemic, which is carved out of the MAC clause.

### C. Evergreen's Other Motives for Lawsuit

**Why sue if you probably can't win?**

**1. Renegotiation leverage:**
   - Lawsuit creates pressure to renegotiate price
   - Evergreen wants to pay less given the changed circumstances
   - Lawsuit is bargaining chip to get a price cut
   - Even if you lose in court, you might win at the negotiating table

**2. Buyer's remorse:**
   - By the time the dispute arises, Evergreen knows C Brands is struggling
   - The deal doesn't look as good as it did in January 2020
   - Evergreen wants a way out or a better deal

**3. Legal strategy:**
   - Even weak claims can have settlement value
   - C Brands might prefer to cut the price rather than fight in court
   - Litigation is expensive and uncertain

**4. Fiduciary duty:**
   - Evergreen's board might feel obligated to try to protect shareholders
   - Even if the claim is weak, not pursuing it could be a breach
   - Lawsuit demonstrates diligence to shareholders

**5. Force majeure / impossibility:**
   - Evergreen might be exploring other legal theories
   - The lawsuit could be a prelude to other claims

**Key insight:** Litigation in M&A is often about leverage, not just legal merits. Lawsuits are tools for renegotiation, even when the legal claims are weak.

### D. Other Clauses to Exit the Deal

**What other clauses can Evergreen use to get out of the deal?**

**1. Debt covenants:**
   - Most acquisition agreements have conditions related to the seller's debt
   - **Example:** "No event has occurred that would permit the lender to declare the debt immediately due and payable"
   - **How it works:** If the seller's financial condition deteriorates and violates debt covenants, the lender could call the loan. This breach of the debt covenant gives Buyer an out

**2. Bring-down of representations:**
   - All representations must be true at closing (not just at signing)
   - **Example:** If C Brands now has undisclosed liabilities, tax problems, or litigation that wasn't disclosed, these are breaches
   - **How it works:** The representations must "bring down" to closing. New problems = breach

**3. Ordinary course covenant:**
   - As discussed, Seller must operate the business in the ordinary course
   - **How it works:** If Seller took drastic actions outside ordinary course, Buyer can terminate

**4. Regulatory approvals:**
   - If regulatory approvals are denied or delayed beyond a certain date
   - **How it works:** This is typically a condition to closing

**5. Material adverse effect on representations:**
   - Some representations are qualified by "except for a MAC"
   - **How it works:** Even if the MAC is carved out, the breach of representation might not be carved out
   - Example: "No litigation is pending...except for a MAC" - the litigation exists regardless of whether there's a MAC

**6. Specific performance failures:**
   - **Example:** "Seller will maintain its properties in good condition"
   - **How it works:** If Seller fails to do this, Buyer can terminate

**Key insight:** Even if the MAC clause is unavailable, acquisition agreements have many other provisions that can give a buyer an exit if the seller's business deteriorates.

## Question 8: "Symmetry" Rationale for MAC Clauses

### A. Why Seller Might Regret Selling and Want to Cancel

**1. Seller's business improves dramatically:**
   - After signing, Seller gets great news
   - New product launch succeeds beyond expectations
   - Big contract signed
   - Stock market rallies and seller's stock soars

**2. Competing bid emerges:**
   - Another buyer offers a higher price
   - Seller wants to accept the better offer
   - Original deal looks like a bad deal now

**3. Seller's shareholders might vote no:**
   - If seller is public, shareholders must approve
   - If business is doing great, shareholders might reject the deal
   - They think the company is worth more than the offer price

**4. Change in circumstances for Seller:**
   - Tax laws change favorably
   - Industry conditions improve
   - Company's prospects brighten

### B. Seller's Shareholder Vote - Buyer's Confidence

**If Seller's business is doing well:**
- **Buyer should NOT be confident**
- Shareholders will likely vote NO
- "Why sell for $50 when our stock is worth $70?"
- Deal is likely to fail

**If Seller's business is doing badly:**
- **Buyer can be MORE confident**
- Shareholders will likely vote YES
- "Better to sell for $50 than hold stock worth $30"
- Deal is likely to succeed

**The problem for Buyers:**
- Buyer makes the deal based on Seller's business at signing
- If business improves, shareholders might reject it
- Buyer loses the deal they spent time and money pursuing
- Buyer has no similar exit mechanism

### C. Does This Put Buyers at a Disadvantage?

**YES - Buyers are at a disadvantage.**

**Why:**

1. **Seller shareholders have an out:**
   - They can vote down the deal
   - They don't need a legal reason
   - They can simply say "the price isn't good enough anymore"

2. **Buyer shareholders don't vote:**
   - If Buyer is public, its shareholders typically don't vote on acquisitions
   - Board approval is sufficient
   - Buyer's shareholders can't easily reject the deal

3. **Asymmetric exit rights:**
   - Seller can walk away via shareholder vote
   - Buyer has no comparable mechanism
   - This creates imbalance if conditions change

**Example:**
- Deal signed at $50/share
- Two months later, Seller's stock is trading at $70/share
- Seller's shareholders: "We're not selling at $50!"
- Buyer: "But we have a deal!"
- Seller's shareholders vote NO → Deal dies
- Buyer has no way out if the situation was reversed

### D. Why Sellers Might Want to "Level the Playing Field"

**Why would Sellers give up their advantage?**

**1. Get the deal done:**
   - Buyers won't sign deals if they're at a structural disadvantage
   - MAC clause makes the deal more attractive to Buyers
   - No MAC clause = no deal (or lower price)

**2. Fairness:**
   - Sellers recognize the imbalance is unfair
   - Both parties should have similar ability to exit if circumstances change dramatically

**3. Reputation:**
   - Being known as a fair negotiator
   - Future deals benefit from reputation for fairness

**4. Efficiency:**
   - Both parties want similar risk allocation
   - Symmetry reduces transaction costs

**5. Market practice:**
   - MAC clauses are standard
   - Going against market norms signals something is wrong

**Key insight:** Sometimes parties willingly give up advantages to get a deal done and to establish fair, balanced risk allocation.

### E. How to Make the Playing Field More Level?

**The solution: A MAC clause that works both ways.**

**Symmetrical MAC clause:**
> "Either party may terminate this Agreement if a Material Adverse Change has occurred with respect to the OTHER party."

**How this creates symmetry:**
- Buyer can terminate if Seller suffers a MAC
- Seller can terminate if Buyer suffers a MAC
- Both parties have similar exit rights

**Wait, does Seller actually get a MAC clause in practice?**
- **Usually NO** - MAC clauses are almost always one-sided (buyer-only)
- But the "symmetry" explanation helps justify WHY MAC clauses exist
- Even though Seller doesn't get a MAC, the existence of Buyer's MAC can be justified as balancing the shareholder vote advantage

**Alternative approach:**
- Seller could get a MAC clause, but it's rare
- More commonly, the shareholder vote advantage is the implicit "seller MAC"

### F. Moral Hazard and MAC Clauses

**What is moral hazard?**

**Moral hazard** occurs when one party has the incentive to take risks because someone else bears the cost of those risks.

**How this applies to MAC clauses:**

**The problem:**
- After signing but before closing, Seller controls the business
- Seller might have incentive to let the business deteriorate
- Why? Because if things get bad enough, Buyer will walk away
- Seller can then try to find a better deal or just keep the company

**Example:**
- Seller signs deal to sell for $100M
- Market turns down and business is now only worth $80M
- Seller thinks: "If I let things get worse, Buyer will walk away"
- Seller cuts costs, defers maintenance, stops pursuing new customers
- Business deteriorates further
- Buyer invokes MAC and walks away
- Seller avoids selling at a "bad" price

**How MAC clauses address this:**
- Actually, MAC clauses might CREATE moral hazard for Sellers
- Seller has incentive to cause a MAC (or let one happen)
- This gives Seller an exit if they want one

**Wait - isn't this backwards?**

**The moral hazard actually works the other way:**
- **Buyer's moral hazard:** Buyer has "buyers remorse" and looks for ANY excuse to call a MAC and renegotiate the price
- Buyer might point to minor problems and claim they're a MAC
- This creates uncertainty for Seller
- Seller doesn't know how hard to try to preserve the business

**The solution:**
- Narrow MAC definition prevents Buyer from abusing the clause
- High bar for what constitutes a MAC
- Specific carve-outs for ordinary course business decisions
- This limits Buyer's ability to manufacture a MAC as an excuse

**Key insight:** MAC clauses create potential moral hazard on both sides. The negotiation is about limiting this moral hazard through careful drafting.

## Question 9: "Investment" Rationale for MAC Clauses

### A. Fran's Situation - What Issue for Buyer?

**The facts:**
- Fran is CEO and largest shareholder of Seller (real estate company)
- Fran signs deal July 1 to sell to Buyer
- Deal closes December 31
- Fran is unlikely to stay on after merger

**The issue: ADVERSE SELECTION and SELLER'S DISCOURAGEMENT**

**Why this is a problem:**

1. **Fran has no incentive to invest in the business:**
   - Why spend money improving properties if she's leaving soon?
   - Why renew leases if she won't be around to benefit?
   - Why maintain the properties properly?

2. **Fran's incentives are misaligned:**
   - She gets paid at closing (December 31)
   - She bears the costs of investment NOW
   - She won't enjoy the benefits LATER
   - Rational response: cut all discretionary spending

3. **Buyer gets a worse business:**
   - Properties deteriorate
   - Leases expire and aren't renewed
   - Tenants leave due to poor maintenance
   - Business value declines between signing and closing

**This is the classic "seller's discouragement" problem.**

### B. Importance of Maintaining Properties and Renewing Leases

**VERY important - but Fran has no incentive to do it.**

**Why it matters:**
- Property values depend on condition
- Vacant properties lose value quickly
- Lease renewals are critical for cash flow
- Tenant relationships matter

**Why Fran won't do it:**
- She's selling in 6 months
- She won't be there to benefit
- Why spend $100,000 renovating a property for the Buyer's benefit?
- Why spend time renewing a 10-year lease that benefits Buyer?

**The problem:**
- Buyer is paying for a well-maintained, fully-leased property
- But between signing and closing, the property might deteriorate
- Buyer ends up with something different than what they bargained for

### C. What Kind of Incentive Problem? How MAC Clause Addresses It?

**The incentive problem: SELLER'S DISCOURAGEMENT (or underinvestment).**

**Similar to moral hazard but specific:**
- Seller has the ability to affect value
- Seller lacks incentive to preserve/increase value
- Seller bears costs of effort; Buyer gets benefits

**How MAC clause addresses this:**

**Actually, the MAC clause doesn't directly solve this problem.**

**What DOES solve it:**

1. **Ordinary course covenant:**
   - "Seller will operate the business in the ordinary course"
   - This includes maintaining properties and renewing leases
   - If Fran doesn't do this, she breaches the covenant
   - Buyer can sue or terminate

2. **Specific covenants:**
   - "Seller will maintain properties in good condition"
   - "Seller will use reasonable efforts to renew leases"
   - Creates specific obligations

3. **Buyer's right to approve major decisions:**
   - "Seller won't take major actions without Buyer's consent"
   - This prevents Seller from making decisions that harm value

**Wait, then where does the "investment" rationale for MAC clauses come in?**

**The "investment" rationale is different:**

- It's about the BUYER'S incentive to invest during the interim period
- Between signing and closing, Buyer might want to start integrating the businesses
- Buyer might want to introduce Seller's products to Buyer's customers
- Buyer might want to make plans that depend on the deal happening

**If there's a MAC clause:**
- Buyer is protected if Seller's business deteriorates dramatically
- This gives Buyer confidence to make investments that depend on the deal
- Without MAC clause, Buyer would be afraid to invest because they might get stuck with a bad deal

**So the "investment" rationale is:**
- MAC clause encourages Buyer to invest in the deal during the interim period
- Buyer knows they can walk away if Seller's business collapses
- This benefits both parties

**Key insight:** The "investment" rationale refers to Buyer's investment in the transaction, not Seller's investment in the business. The ordinary course covenant, not the MAC clause, addresses Seller's underinvestment problem.

## Question 10: MAC Clause Analysis

### A. The Core MAC Language

> *"Material Adverse Change" shall mean any event change that is materially adverse to the business, assets, or operations of the Company...*

**This creates the basic right to terminate if the business suffers a material decline.**

### B. The Carve-outs (Exceptions)

> *...provided, however, that none of the following shall constitute a Material Adverse Change: changes in the national or world economy or financial markets as a whole or changes in general economic conditions that affect the industries in which the Company conducts business or any change in applicable law...*

**These are events that DON'T justify termination, even if they harm the business.**

**What's carved out:**
- General economic downturns
- Financial market crashes
- Industry-wide problems
- Changes in law

**Why these are carved out:**
- These risks are allocated to the Buyer
- Buyer is better positioned to bear systemic risks
- These are beyond Seller's control
- This is standard market practice

### C. The "Carve-out from the Carve-out" (Disproportionate Impact)

> *...so long as such changes or conditions do not adversely affect the Company in a materially disproportionate manner relative to other similarly situated participants in the industries or markets in which they operate.*

**What this means:**
- Even if something is carved out (like a general economic downturn), Buyer can STILL terminate if Seller is hurt MORE than others
- Seller must be affected "disproportionately" relative to peers
- This puts company-specific risk back on Seller

**Example:**
- Recession hits the retail industry
- All retail stores see sales decline 15%
- But this Seller's stores decline 40%
- This disproportionate impact CAN be a MAC
- Even though general economic downturn is carved out

**Key insight:** This preserves the MAC for company-specific problems, even when they coincide with broader issues.

### D. Economic Downturns - Who Bears the Risk?

**The language:**
> *"changes in the national or world economy or financial markets as a whole...shall not constitute a Material Adverse Change"*

**Who bears the risk? THE BUYER.**

**Why:**
- These risks are explicitly carved out
- Buyer cannot invoke MAC for general economic problems
- Buyer must proceed even if recession hits
- Buyer allocated systemic risk to themselves

**Why this allocation makes sense:**
- Buyer is often better diversified than Seller
- Buyer can weather downturns across portfolio
- These risks are beyond Seller's control
- Market standard allocation

### E. Firm-Specific Problems - Who Bears the Risk?

**Who bears the risk? THE SELLER.**

**Why:**
- Firm-specific problems are NOT carved out
- These remain the basis for a MAC
- Buyer can terminate if Seller has unique problems

**Does this allocation make sense? YES.**

**Why:**
1. **Seller knows the business better:**
   - Seller is aware of company-specific risks
   - Seller is in best position to prevent problems
   - Information advantage favors Seller bearing this risk

2. **Control:**
   - Seller can control company-specific performance
   - Cannot control economy or industry
   - Should bear risk for what can control

3. **Pricing:**
   - Deal price reflects company-specific value
   - If Seller's unique problems emerge, price is no longer justified
   - Buyer should have exit for company-specific deterioration

4. **Fairness:**
   - Buyer signed up for Seller's business, not a different/worse one
   - If Seller's unique problems emerge, the deal is fundamentally changed

**Key insight:** MAC clauses allocate systemic risk to Buyer and company-specific risk to Seller. This is efficient risk allocation.

### F. Online Grocer - Increased Demand, Reduced Profitability

**The facts:**
- Deal closes October 2019 (before pandemic)
- Seller is an online grocery delivery service
- Pandemic increases demand dramatically
- But profitability is down (costs are higher)

**Can Buyer back out? NO.**

**Analysis:**

1. **Is there a MAC?**
   - Business has more demand, not less
   - Profitability problems are due to pandemic (costs surge)
   - The core business is STRONGER, not weaker

2. **Pandemic carve-out:**
   - Even if this were a MAC (it's not), the pandemic is carved out
   - Changes in general economic conditions are carved out
   - This is a pandemic effect on the industry

3. **Disproportionate impact?**
   - Online grocery has BENEFITED from pandemic
   - Demand is UP, not down
   - This is positive, not negative

4. **Profitability vs. business condition:**
   - Short-term profitability issues ≠ MAC
   - MAC looks at long-term earnings power
   - This business appears to have improved long-term prospects

**Conclusion:** Buyer cannot back out. This is not a MAC - it's a change, but not a MATERIAL ADVERSE one. If anything, the business looks better long-term.

### G. International Airline - All Routes Cancelled

**The facts:**
- Seller is an airline with ONLY international routes
- No local routes
- All routes cancelled (US to Europe and Asia)
- Pandemic is the cause

**Can Buyer back out? PROBABLY NOT (but it's closer).**

**Analysis:**

1. **Is there a MAC?**
   - Business has been devastated
   - ALL routes cancelled
   - Zero revenue (or close to it)
   - This SEEMS like a MAC

2. **Pandemic carve-out:**
   - The pandemic is specifically carved out
   - Changes in general economic conditions carved out
   - This is directly caused by pandemic

3. **Disproportionate impact argument:**
   - ALL airlines have been hurt by pandemic
   - International airlines have been hit especially hard
   - Is this seller hurt MORE than peers?
   - Maybe - if other airlines have some domestic routes, this seller is worse off

4. **Counterargument:**
   - The disproportionate impact must be relative to "similarly situated participants"
   - Other international-only airlines are in same position
   - This is industry-wide, not company-specific

**Likely result:** Buyer CANNOT back out. This is a pandemic effect on the industry, which is carved out. Even though it's severe, it's not a MAC under this clause.

**But note:** If the seller had some unique vulnerability (worse balance sheet, older planes, weaker competitive position), there might be an argument for disproportionate impact.

### H. Restaurant Chain - Terrorism in One City

**The facts:**
- Seller owns chain of restaurants across US
- Half of restaurants are in Metropolis (a major city)
- Act of terrorism in Metropolis
- Consumers in Metropolis are cautious; many stop going to restaurants
- Consumers in OTHER cities don't change behavior

**Can Buyer invoke this? YES, potentially.**

**Analysis:**

1. **Is there a MAC?**
   - Business has been materially affected
   - Half the restaurants are in one city that's been hit
   - This could be material and durational

2. **Terrorism carve-out?**
   - Most MAC clauses carve out terrorism
   - But this one doesn't explicitly mention terrorism
   - So terrorism itself is not carved out

3. **Is it a general economic change?**
   - Terrorism is specific to Metropolis
   - Other cities unaffected
   - This is NOT an economy-wide or industry-wide change

4. **Disproportionate impact:**
   - This seller is DISPROPORTIONATELY affected
   - Half their restaurants are in Metropolis
   - Competitors with more geographically diverse restaurants are less affected
   - This is a company-specific vulnerability

5. **Company-specific risk:**
   - Seller's concentration in Metropolis is company-specific
   - Seller chose to concentrate in one city
   - This risk allocation belongs to Seller

**Conclusion:** This LIKELY IS a MAC that Buyer can invoke. The terrorism affects this seller disproportionately due to its unique concentration in Metropolis. This is company-specific risk, not systemic risk.

**Key insight:** When problems affect the company more than its peers (even if the trigger is a broader event), the MAC clause can be invoked because of the "disproportionate impact" carve-out to the carve-out.

## Key Takeaways

### The Three Core Contractual Mechanisms

**1. Representations:**
- Statements of fact about the business
- Function: Information production
- Breach leads to liability

**2. Covenants:**
- Promises about future behavior
- Function: Behavior control
- Breach leads to liability

**3. Conditions:**
- Requirements to close
- Function: Risk allocation and exit rights
- Failure allows termination without liability

### Materiality and Knowledge Qualifiers

**Materiality qualifiers:**
- Limit disclosure to "material" items
- Reduce seller's burden
- But many small items can aggregate into something material
- Solution: Dollar thresholds + aggregate caps + baskets

**Knowledge qualifiers:**
- Limit seller's liability to what they know
- Appropriate for things seller couldn't be expected to know (threatened lawsuits)
- Inappropriate for things seller can and should know (accounts receivable, tax compliance)
- Rule: Only accept knowledge qualifier when seller truly couldn't know

### The Judgment-Proof Seller Problem

**The problem:**
- Seller breaches representations
- Buyer sues and wins
- But Seller has no money to pay the judgment
- Right to sue is meaningless

**Solutions:**
- **Escrow/holdback:** Hold back portion of purchase price for survival period
- **R&W insurance:** Insurance pays for breaches
- **Seller financing:** Creates ongoing leverage
- **Personal guarantees:** Makes shareholder assets at risk
- **Due diligence:** Discover problems before closing

### MAC Clauses - Three Components

**1. Core definition:**
- "Any event that is materially adverse to the business"
- Creates basic termination right

**2. Carve-outs:**
- Events that DON'T qualify as MAC
- General economic downturns, industry problems, pandemics, acts of God
- Allocates systemic risk to Buyer

**3. Disproportionate impact:**
- Even carved-out events can be MAC if they hit Seller harder than peers
- Preserves company-specific risk allocation to Seller

### Two Rationales for MAC Clauses

**1. Symmetry rationale:**
- Sellers have shareholder vote as an exit mechanism
- Buyers have no comparable exit
- MAC clause levels the playing field
- Both parties have ways to exit if circumstances change

**2. Investment rationale:**
- Between signing and closing, Buyer invests time and resources in the deal
- Buyer might start planning integration
- MAC clause protects Buyer if Seller's business collapses
- This gives Buyer confidence to proceed with deal-related investments

### MAC Clauses in Practice - High Bar

**Courts require:**
1. **Materiality:** Severe decline, not a "blip"
2. **Durational significance:** Long-term effect on earnings power (years, not months)
3. **Company-specific:** Not just industry-wide problems
4. **Disproportionate impact:** Seller hurt more than peers

**The Akorn case (2018):**
- First time Delaware court found a MAC
- EBITDA declined 86% in one year
- Analyst valuations dropped from $32 to $5-12 per share
- New competition emerged (company-specific)
- Regulatory compliance problems (company-specific)
- Court emphasized: long-term earnings power perspective

### Contract Realism

**Contracts in context:**
- Contracts can't allocate all risk
- External shocks (pandemics) stress rigid allocations
- Mutual dependence may require flexibility
- Strict enforcement can be lose-lose for everyone
- Sometimes renegotiation is the efficient outcome

**The shopping mall case:**
- Contract said tenant must pay rent
- Pandemic made this unworkable
- Landlord forgave some rent to preserve tenant relationship
- Both parties better off than strict enforcement

## Notes for Class Discussion

- **Distinguish representations, covenants, and conditions clearly** - this is fundamental to M&A agreements
- **Think about risk allocation** - every clause represents a choice about who bears which risk
- **MAC clauses are Buyer's most important protection** - understand why they exist and how they work
- **Narrowing representations is a red flag** - when Seller qualifies or narrows, ask why
- **Materiality and knowledge qualifiers are negotiated** - understand their purpose and when they're appropriate
- **COVID cases show real-world application** - MAC clauses matter in crises
- **Judgment-proof seller problem is real** - escrow and R&W insurance are practical solutions
- **Contracts exist in economic context** - sometimes flexibility beats strict enforcement
- **Akorn case is precedent-setting** - first time Delaware court found a MAC; very high bar
