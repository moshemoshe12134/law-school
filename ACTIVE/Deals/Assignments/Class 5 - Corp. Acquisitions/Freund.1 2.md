**7.3. [Every Seller's Favorite Caveats]{.underline}**

There are two recurrent themes sounded by every seller's attorney who
ever negotiated the representations article of an acquisition agreement.
One is materiality and the other is knowledge. Some bitter pitched
battles have been fought over these innocuous-sounding concepts, to
which we now turn.

**7.3.1. [Materiality is in the Eye of the Beholder]{.underline}**

First, materiality.^2^[^1] The seller's attorney argues that he should
only be required to list *material* contracts, not every insignificant
commitment. He wants the representation to read that the seller has no
*material* liabilities other than those set forth on the balance sheet;
or that the seller is not a party to any *material* litigation, except
as set forth in the disclosure schedule; and so forth. A typical
colloquy on the subject runs as follows:

Seller's Attorney: "I would like the word 'material' inserted ahead
\[*off-handedly*\] of the word 'litigation' in paragraph 3(h)."

Purchaser's Attorney: "No dice, Harry. I want to know about *all* your
\[*with a knowing smile*\] litigation; then I'll decide what *is*
material and what isn't."

Seller's Attorney: "Look, Joe, in the ordinary course of business
\[*feigning irritation*\] we have a bundle of small litigation, penny
ante stuff. It's handled by twenty-five different lawyers, all over the
country. I'm not sure we could even compile a list of every matter."

> Purchaser's Attorney: "Anyway, Harry, what is the test of materiality?
> Sure, you have a big company here, but if there's a multiplicity of
> litigation, it might have significance in the aggregate\--and perhaps
> it will educate us on some risks in your business\--and maybe some of
> it involves basic principles, although miniscule dollars. So I want to
> know all about it."
>
> Seller's Attorney: "Come on, Joe, you're going to make this deal for
> the same price whether you have all these details or not. And I don't
> want you tracking down the seller three months after the closing
> because I forgot to include some two-bit claim in the schedule."

All right, both sides have now staked out their position. The seller's
counsel has done his job in raising and arguing the point; the
purchaser's lawyer has performed yeoman service in resisting the change.
How is the issue to be won, lost or compromised?

There are no comprehensive guidelines for dealing with the seller's
desire for materiality caveats in representations. It usually comes down
to a question of identifying and attempting to satisfy, by one means or
another, the real objectives of the parties (or rather their attorneys,
since it is the lawyers who usually play this materiality game), without
giving up what are considered vital protections.

To get at this question more analytically, let's oversimplify the
motives of the purchaser's attorney in resisting materiality caveats by
dividing them into one or more of three categories: P-1, he wants to
unearth information; P-2, he wants to lay the basis for his client to
walk away if things are not as represented; and P-3, he wants to set his
client up for indemnification if there are any unpleasant surprises
after the closing. The seller's attorney, on the other hand, usually has
one or more of these reciprocal concerns: S-1, he might want to conceal
unpleasant information^2^[^2] or simply avoid certain tedious tasks
involving what he considers to be essentially trivia; S-2, he is not
willing to furnish purchaser with an out over a minor misrepresentation,
in the event that purchaser turns luke-warm on the deal and needs an
excuse to call it off; and S-3, he is trying to guard against purchaser
going after his client for indemnification down the road.

Now let's examine the subject of the prior dialogue in light of these
considerations. Assume in the first case that purchaser's attorney is
interested in complete information \[P-1\] while seller's attorney is
worried about small claims \[S-3\]. Well, the usual compromise here is
to require seller to list *all* litigation, not just *material*
lawsuits\--but to provide in the indemnification section of the
agreement for a "basket" or "cushion";^2^[^3] i.e., a provision to the
effect that the purchaser is only entitled to be indemnified if the
aggregate of the items seller has failed to disclose or otherwise
misrepresented reaches a certain prescribed level.

Take a different case. Assume that purchaser's lawyer wants his full
pound of flesh under the indemnification provisions \[P-3\]; that
seller's counsel is not concerned about *that* problem, but is really
bothered by the prospect that purchaser will use the omission of some
trivial litigation (including lawsuits brought against seller between
signing and closing)^2^[^4] as the pretext for breaking off the
agreement at the last moment because, for example, market conditions
change \[S-2\]; and that the purchaser has told his attorney that he
fully intends to close this deal, come hell or high water. What you work
out here generally is the required listing of *all* litigation, with a
flat indemnification against any omissions, but the inclusion of a
provision in the conditions section to the effect that only a
misrepresentation which has a material adverse effect on the financial
condition or results of operations of the seller can furnish the
purchaser with an out.^2^[^5]

Or assume a situation where seller's attorney is truly troubled by the
prospects of assembling a host of insignificant data \[S-1\], while
purchaser's lawyer, concerned that his investigation will uncover items
which are ambiguous in terms of materiality, does not want to abdicate
the right to decide what is sufficiently material to permit purchaser to
walk away \[P-3\]. This kind of impasse comes up at numerous points in
the representations article,^2^[^6] as well as in those dealing with
covenants and conditions. Whenever the parties are either unwilling or
unable to decide between materiality and non-materiality, the usual
solution is to fix an objective standard as the criterion for disclosure
(and thus for indemnification and other purposes). So in this case, the
compromise might be for the representation to require a listing of each
item of litigation against the seller involving a claim in excess of,
say, \$10,000. If the purchaser really isn't interested in the "small
stuff," why put the seller to the trouble of compiling a useless dossier
of immaterial litigation? As a further precaution, to guard against a
great number of individually insignificant small claims which are
substantial in the aggregate, the purchaser could insists upon receiving
a representation that the aggregate of the litigation omitted by reason
of this exclusion does not exceed the sum of, say, \$50,000.

Three final points on materiality. If, representing the purchaser you
have acceded to a provision in the conditions article limiting the
purchaser's termination right to misrepresentations having a material
adverse effect upon the seller, while at the same time in the
representations article you have permitted the seller numerous
materiality caveats, then you run the risk of double materiality-i.e.,
the aggregate total of omitted information which does *not* constitute
misrepresentations can be quite large without acting as a partial
trigger to the condition. If you find over the course of negotiating
several representations that seller's attorney is a bug on materiality
you can suggest that, instead of negotiating this matter with respect to
each representation, you will simply put that "material adverse effect"
language into the condition section. Or, if he is worried about
indemnification, you should hint at the strong possibility of a basket,
the size of which will be determined "after I've heard all your
problems."^2^[^7]

Second, you must remember to be precise grammatically in your use of the
word "material." It is one thing for the seller to represent that "there
has been no material breach of any agreement" and quite another for him
to say "there has been no breach of any material agreement." In the
former case, the discovery of a substantive breach of a minor contract
could lead to dire consequences, while in the latter, although only
major agreements are involved, even a technical breach would present
problems. Seller's counsel may well try to double up and ask for "no
material breach of any material agreement."

Finally, whatever the concept of materiality may mean, at the very least
it is always relative to the situation. I remember well one particular
day a number of years ago in which I was both assisting in negotiating a
quite sizeable merger in one room and involved in a run-of-the-mill
acquisition of a private company that was going on in another. The
insurance company we represented in the large deal was concerned that,
if it were called upon to pay a substantial claim prior to closing,
*that* might constitute a material adverse event giving the other party
an out. I raised the point. Counsel on the other side asked, "What is
your largest single policy?" Our client replied that it involved certain
atomic energy coverage. "How big a loss could you suffer?," queried the
other lawyer. Our client pondered this for a moment, and then answered
that it could be in the neighborhood of \$10,000,000. "Aha," said
opposing counsel, "that simply would not be material." And, in the
context of the numbers in that deal, he was absolutely right! Later in
the day I joined the other negotiation, and participated for two hours
in a vociferous fight over an additional \$5,000 of salary for seller's
president. To *him*, it was extremely material; and I can't say that I
disagree.

**7.3.2. A Little Knowledge is a Dangerous Thing**

Turning now to the knowledge caveat, it is obvious that the seller would
prefer everyone of his representations to be qualified "to the best of
his knowledge"\--the theory being that, although he would still be on
the hook for items he knew about but failed to disclose, he would escape
liability for undisclosed matters concerning which he had no actual
knowledge. For example, if seller's prior management had given a
mortgage on certain corporate property, but for some reason the
instrument did not appear in the corporate records and the mortgagee had
never recorded the lien, seller would not be liable if he had
represented that, to his knowledge, there were no such mortgages.
Without the knowledge caveat, he would be stuck.

From the viewpoint of purchaser's attorney, I think there is a common
sense rule to be followed in this type of situation: the only time that
you should voluntarily accept a knowledge caveat from seller is in a
situation where, if seller does not in fact possess the information, he
should not be required to stand behind the representation. The
distinction can be seen in the usual litigation representation, where
seller is asked to describe both pending and threatened lawsuits.^2^[^8]
The pending portion is almost always unqualified, but the seller is
certainly entitled to a knowledge caveat with respect to threats; the
fact that the potential plaintiff has been boasting of his litigious
intentions at the neighborhood tavern shouldn't matter a whit. Another
example involves the sometime representation that there is no event or
condition pertaining to the business or assets of seller that may
materially adversely affect such business or assets; the best seller can
really say is that he doesn't know of any problems along these lines.

Or take, for instance, the representation that the seller's use of a
particular trade name does not violate the rights of any third party.
Now, assuming that seller has been using this name for a good while, and
assuming that he is not aware of any other company using the name, and
assuming that no third party has ever made any claim of violation (i.e.,
brought the matter to seller's knowledge), and assuming that the trade
name is not *that* vital to the seller's business, it would not be
inappropriate to accept a knowledge caveat from the seller in that
situation.

On the other hand, in the usual case the purchaser is simply looking for
a guarantee, and it becomes immaterial whether the seller actually has
or hasn't the requisite knowledge. In these situations, the purchaser's
attorney should refuse to permit the knowledge caveat to create
ambiguity in the legal relations existing between the parties. For
example, the purchaser should never allow the seller's representation
that his accounts receivable are current and collectible^2^[^9] to be
made to the best of his knowledge. The purchaser wants to be indemnified
if those receivables turn out to be bad. The seller might well have no
idea that the receivables will ultimately be worthless, and yet the risk
of loss should fall upon the seller in that case. In more complex areas,
such as unknown liabilities, unless there is a particular rationale to
the contrary, I take the view that generally the seller (who is presumed
to know his business better than purchaser) should bear the risk\--and
thus the purchaser should not agree to a knowledge caveat.^2^[^10]

[^2]: ^21^ My experience is that this is not true of most seller's
    lawyers who, if not always moved as one might hope by ethical
    considerations, take the practical view that it is better to
    disclose now\--since the adverse fact is likely to come out later to
    his client's financial discomfort.
