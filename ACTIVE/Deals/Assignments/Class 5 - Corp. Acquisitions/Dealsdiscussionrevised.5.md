**Discussion Questions \# 5 (Panel 1)**

1.  Acquisition agreements contain representations, covenants, and
    conditions? What is the difference?

2.  Is the following language a representation, a covenant, or a
    condition?

    a.  "Target and the Shareholder jointly and severally represent,
        warrant and agree as follows: Target is a corporation duly
        organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
        of the State of Delaware, with the power to own its property, to
        carry on its business as now being conducted, and to enter into
        and carry out the terms of this Agreement."

    b.  "Each balance sheet delivered to Acquiring pursuant to this
        Agreement shall reflect all claims, debts or liabilities of
        Target which should be reflected thereon in accordance with
        generally accepted accounting principles."

    c.  "During the period from the date hereof to and including the
        Closing, Target will conduct its business solely in the usual
        and ordinary manner and will refrain from any transaction not in
        the ordinary course of business or except as otherwise permitted
        herein unless the prior written consent of Acquiring to such
        transaction has been obtained."

    d.  "No action or proceeding before a court or any other
        governmental agency or body shall have been instituted or
        threatened to restrain or prohibit the Merger contemplated
        hereby."

3.  You represent the buyer of a company. You send over the following
    representation: "Target is not subject to any material liability by
    reason of a violation of any order, rule, or regulation of any
    Federal, state, municipal or other governmental agency." In
    response, the seller changes the language. Find the change. What do
    you learn from the change they made in the language, and what follow
    up questions do you want to ask?

    a.  "Target is not subject to any material liability by reason of a
        criminal violation of any order, rule, or regulation of any
        Federal, state, municipal or other governmental agency,

    b.  "Target is not subject to any material liability by reason of a
        violation of any order, rule, or regulation of any national
        governmental agency."

4.  Materiality & Knowledge Qualifiers

<!-- -->

a.  You represent the seller. Your client is asked to make the following
    representation: "Target has paid all taxes and assessments
    (including interest or penalties) owed by it to the extent that such
    taxes and assessments are due." Why might you want to add the word
    "material," so that the rep reads "Target has paid all material
    taxes . . . ."

b.  Let's say we define "material" as an issue involving at least \$500.
    Do you see a problem with defining materiality in this way? Hint:
    does it matter how many nonmaterial facts are left out? How can we
    deal with this problem?

c.  Buyer wants to buy a plot of land, and asks Seller to give assurance
    that Seller actually owns the land. Seller sends over the following
    representation: "To the best of my knowledge, I am the legal owner
    of this land." You represent Buyer, who asks whether he should
    accept this representation. Are you comfortable with it?

d.  Buyer wants to buy a business, and asks Seller to give assurance
    that no one has already sued the business, and that no one is
    threatening to sue the business in the future. Seller offers the
    following representation: "No one has sued our business and, to the
    best of the knowledge, no one is threatening to sue the business."
    You represent Buyer. Are you comfortable with this representation?

<!-- -->

5.  False Representations

<!-- -->

a.  What happens if a seller gives a representation that turns out not
    to be true? Can you think of circumstances in which a buyer does not
    get any meaningful protection from a representation, even if he can
    easily show it was false?

b.  How can a buyer plan in advance to prevent this sort of problem?

c.  Explain why a buyer might demand the following language in an
    acquisition agreement: "Seller hereby agrees that at the Closing,
    upon receipt of the Merger Shares, he will immediately deposit
    15,000 of such Merger Shares into escrow for a period ending no
    later than 42 months after the Closing at which time the escrowed
    Merger Shares then remaining in escrow will be returned to him."

6.  Ann owned a shopping mall during the pandemic. One of her tenants,
    Ben, owned a restaurant. Ben's lease ran through 2023. Because of
    the pandemic, Ben had to close his restaurant on April 1, 2020, and
    did not send Ann any rent for several months, starting in April. The
    lease had no exceptions for pandemics (or for anything else), so Ben
    was clearly breaching his contractual commitment. Why might Ann have
    decided not to evict Ben? Why might she have been willing instead to
    forgive some rent if he agreed (eventually) to pay the rest later
    when his business revived? What does this fact pattern tell us about
    the limits of the influence of contracts?

7.  Carl is the CEO and largest shareholder of a public company, C
    Brands, which owns a chain of stores and a popular brand of women's
    apparel called "D's Secret." Sales have been flat or declining for
    several years. In January 2020, Carl signs a deal in which a private
    equity firm, Evergreen, agrees to buy 55% of the stock of C Brands.
    The deal has a "MAC" clause, which specifically carves out "the
    Covid-19 pandemic," so Evergreen cannot invoke the Pandemic as a
    reason to terminate the deal. In the contract, C Brands makes the
    following commitment: "The seller will continue to operate the
    business in the ordinary course and will not take any major actions
    without the prior consent of the buyer."

    a.  In response to the Pandemic, most of C Brands' stores were
        legally required to close. Carl decides to furlough 1,600
        employees, and also stops paying rent on most of the stores.
        Carl also slashes employee compensation. As you read the
        language above, do any of these steps give Evergreen the legal
        right to cancel the deal?

    b.  Evergreen brings a lawsuit to terminate the deal. Among other
        reasons, Evergreen alleges that D-Brands has "\"drastically
        \[reduced\] new merchandise receipts which, when coupled with
        D-Brands\' failure to dispose of existing out-of-season,
        obsolete and excess merchandise, has saddled the D\'s Secret
        Business with a stock of merchandise of greatly diminished
        value.\" Based on the contractual language above, do you think
        this is a winning argument?

    c.  In bringing a lawsuit, what other motive might Evergreen have
        aside from trying to terminate the deal?

    d.  Assuming the MAC clause carves out the Covid pandemic, what
        other clauses are there in a typical deal that Evergreen can try
        to use to get out of this deal? (Hint: What is a debt covenant?)

8.  "Symmetry" Rationale for MAC clauses: When a seller and a buyer sign
    a contract, they presumably expect to close the deal in a few weeks
    or months, but sometimes things change.

    a.  Why might a seller regret selling and want to cancel the deal?

    b.  Assume the seller is a public company, and the relevant
        jurisdiction requires shareholders to vote to approve a deal
        before the deal can close. If the seller's business is doing
        well in the weeks before the shareholder vote, how confident can
        the buyer be that the deal will close? What if the seller's
        business is doing badly?

    c.  The buyer's stockholders do not have to vote to approve a deal.
        Does this put buyers at a disadvantage if conditions change
        after a deal is signed?

    d.  Assume that corporate law gives seller's an advantage over
        buyers, in affording sellers (but not buyers) ways to back out
        of a deal if market conditions change. Is there a reason why
        sellers might want to give up this advantage and "level the
        playing field"?

    e.  How could sellers make the playing field more level? What kind
        of clause could they use? Note that some commentators call this
        a "symmetry" explanation for the relevant contractual term.

    f.  Once again, we see the need for contractual (or other) responses
        to incentive and information problems. What does the term "moral
        hazard" mean and how does it apply to this issue?

9.  Investment Rationale for MAC Clauses: Fran is the CEO of Seller,
    which owns residential real estate. She signs a deal on July 1 to
    sell the company to Buyer, which also owns real estate. The deal is
    scheduled to close on December 31.

    a.  Fran knows that she is unlikely to stay on after the merger
        closes. What issue does that create for Buyer?

    b.  How important is it to continue to maintain the properties and
        to renew the relevant leases? How motivated is Seller's
        management to pursue these goals?

    c.  What kind of incentive problem are we describing? How could a
        MAC clause play a role in addressing it? Note that some
        commentators call this an "investment" explanation for a MAC
        clause.

10. Assume that an acquisition agreement includes the following
    definition of a "material adverse change" or "MAC":

> *"Material Adverse Change" shall mean any event change that is
> materially adverse to the business, assets, or operations of the
> Company; provided, however, that none of the following shall
> constitute a Material Adverse Change: changes in the national or world
> economy or financial markets as a whole or changes in general economic
> conditions that affect the industries in which the Company conducts
> business or any change in applicable law, so long as such changes or
> conditions do not adversely affect the Company in a materially
> disproportionate manner relative to other similarly situated
> participants in the industries or markets in which they operate.*

a.  Like other MAC clauses, this one has three components. First, it
    says that a deal can be cancelled if there is a "material adverse
    change." Please quote the relevant language.

b.  The second component of MAC clauses is a list of exceptions or carve
    outs, which do not justify a change. Please quote the relevant
    language.

c.  The third component creates "a carve out from the carve out."
    Something that otherwise would be excluded can still justify
    termination of the deal in some circumstances. What are those
    circumstances? Please quote the relevant language.

d.  In the clause above, does the buyer or the seller bear the risk of
    economic downturns and other general market conditions? Why do you
    think the risk is allocated in that way?

e.  In the clause above, does the buyer or the seller bear the risk of
    firm-specific problems? Why? Does this allocation of risk make
    sense?

f.  Assume that the language above was used in a deal that closed in
    October of 2019. Assume the seller is an online retailer that
    delivers groceries and other products to people's homes. Assume that
    the pandemic has increased demand for the seller's services, but
    reduced its profitability (because its costs are higher). Under this
    MAC clause, is the buyer able to back out?

g.  The same as "f," but the seller is an airline that has no local
    routes and runs only international flights. These routes, connecting
    the U.S. to Europe and Asia, have all been cancelled. Under this MAC
    clause, is the buyer able to back out?

h.  Assume the seller owns a chain of restaurants across the United
    States, and assume there is an act of terrorism in Metropolis, a
    major U.S. city where half of seller's restaurants are located. In
    response to the act of terrorism, consumers in Metropolis are more
    cautious and many stop going to restaurants, but consumers in other
    cities do not change their behavior. Can the buyer invoke this to
    get out of the deal?
