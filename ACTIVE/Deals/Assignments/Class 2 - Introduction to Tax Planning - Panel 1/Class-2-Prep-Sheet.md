# Class 2 Prep Sheet: Introduction to Tax Planning (Regulatory Arbitrage)

**Course:** Deals
**Topic:** Introduction to Tax Planning (Panel 1)
**Date:** 2026

---

## Key Concepts Overview

### 1. Big Picture: “Regulatory Arbitrage”

**Regulatory arbitrage** is exploiting the fact that **economically similar arrangements can be treated differently by law** (here, tax law). The basic move is:

- Identify two structures that are **economically close substitutes**
- Notice they get **different tax results**
- Restructure the deal to get the better result (as long as the non-tax costs don’t outweigh the tax savings)

### 2. Core Tax Vocabulary (Enough for Class)

- **Gross income:** what the tax system counts as income (the “base”).
- **Exclusion:** value you receive that is **not included** in gross income.
- **Deduction:** an amount you **subtract** from income before calculating tax (usually costs of earning income).
- **Valuation:** what something is “worth” for tax purposes (often fair market value); changing valuation changes tax.
- **Ordinary income vs. capital gain:** ordinary (salary/services) is typically taxed at **higher rates**; capital gain (profit on investment) often at **lower rates** and only when realized (sold).
- **Timing / deferral:** paying the same tax later is usually better than paying it now because of the time value of money.

### 3. The “Five Levers” of Tax Planning (Plus Two Cross-Cutting Checks)

| Lever | What It Is | Intuition |
|---|---|---|
| **Exclusion** | Make value fall outside gross income | “If it’s not in the base, it’s not taxed.” |
| **Valuation** | Argue the taxed item is worth less | “Lower value, lower tax.” |
| **Conversion** | Reclassify from high-tax category to low-tax category | “Turn ordinary into capital gain.” |
| **Deferral** | Pay later instead of now | “Interest-free loan from the government.” |
| **Shifting** | Move income to a lower-tax taxpayer/jurisdiction | “Same dollars, lower rate.” |

Two checks you should run on every “clever” idea:

1. **All parties:** the tax benefit to one party can be a tax cost to another, so compute the net.
2. **Frictions:** non-tax costs (cash needs, control, reputational risk, enforcement/admin limits) can kill the strategy.

## Question 1: Salary vs. Gift (Emma / Barbara)

### A. Does Emma pay tax on $100,000 salary?

**YES.** Salary is classic taxable income. With a 50% rate, her tax would be **$50,000**.

### B. Would $80,000 salary + $20,000 “gift” reduce Emma’s tax bill (ignore special employee gift rule)?

**YES.**

- Salary taxed: $80,000 × 50% = **$40,000**
- Gift excluded: $20,000 × 0% = **$0**
- **Total tax: $40,000** (vs. $50,000 before)

### C. “Economically similar structures can yield dramatically different tax outcomes.”

**YES, I agree.** That is the engine of tax planning: change the *label/structure* while keeping the *economics* similar.

---

## Question 2: Barbara’s Perspective (Deductions, All Parties, Sharing the Surplus)

### A. Is Barbara taxed on the full $300,000? What is a deduction? Can she deduct salary?

**NO.** She is taxed on **profit**, not gross revenue (in a simplified model).

**Deduction:** an amount you subtract from income before computing tax.

**Employer salary deduction:** **YES** (in general) — wages paid to produce income are a business expense.

### B. Can Barbara deduct the gift?

**NO (as framed here).** Whether the gift is $10,000 or $20,000, we generally do not deduct personal gifts (wedding gifts, birthday gifts). So “gift” treatment helps the *recipient* but can hurt the *payer*.

### C. What happens to Barbara if she agrees to $80,000 salary + $20,000 gift (instead of $100,000 salary)?

**Barbara is worse off (in the U.S.-style rule where gifts are not deductible).**

Baseline (all salary):
- Taxable income: $300,000 − $100,000 = **$200,000**
- Tax (50%): **$100,000**

Salary + gift:
- Taxable income: $300,000 − $80,000 = **$220,000** (gift not deductible)
- Tax (50%): **$110,000**

**Barbara’s tax goes up by $10,000.** Notice the symmetry:
- Emma saves $10,000 (from Q1)
- Barbara loses $10,000
- **Net “system” savings = $0** (it’s basically redistribution unless the rules differ across parties/jurisdictions)

### D. “Tax planners must analyze tax consequences for all parties.”

**YES, I agree.** Many “great” ideas die once we compute both sides.

### E. What if Barbara is in a country that allows employers to deduct gifts?

**YES, that changes everything.** If Barbara can deduct the gift, her taxable income is the same as if it were salary:

- Taxable income: $300,000 − $80,000 − $20,000 = **$200,000**
- Tax: **$100,000** (same as baseline)

Now Emma’s strategy creates a real net gain (lower tax for Emma, no added tax for Barbara), so Barbara is much more willing to cooperate.

### F. What if Barbara proposes $80,000 salary + $15,000 gift (same “E” world)?

**Would Emma prefer it to $100,000 salary? YES.**

- Emma after-tax under $100k salary: $100,000 × (1 − 0.50) = **$50,000**
- Emma after-tax under $80k salary + $15k gift: ($80,000 × 0.50) + $15,000 = **$55,000**

**Why would Barbara prefer this?** Because the parties can **share the tax surplus**:

- Emma is still better off than the all-salary baseline
- Barbara pays **$95,000** instead of $100,000 total compensation

### G. “Parties will share the tax benefit.”

**YES, I agree.** If one party needs the other’s cooperation to generate the tax benefit, bargaining usually splits the surplus (often by adjusting pre-tax cash flows).

---

## Question 3: Exclusion / Valuation (Paying in Kind; Undervaluing)

### A. If ABC cuts salary to $60k and gives a $40k car, does Emma’s tax change?

**NO (in principle).** If you are paid with goods/services instead of cash, you are still taxed on **their value** (fair market value).

### B. Why does Emma want ABC to hold the car for a week before giving it to her?

**She is trying to lower the car’s valuation at the moment she receives it** (new → used), so she can argue she received less taxable compensation.

### C. If the car is worth $30k when transferred, what is ABC’s compensation deduction?

**$30,000** (simplified: employer deduction matches employee inclusion).

### D. Does ABC get any additional deduction?

**YES (in concept).** If ABC paid $40k and transfers something now worth $30k, ABC has a **$10k loss/decline in value**. In a simplified model, that $10k can be deducted too, so:

- Employer total deductions: $30k (comp) + $10k (loss) = **$40k**

Key “all parties” intuition:
- Lower valuation helps the employee (lower inclusion),
- But it can reduce the employer’s deduction unless the employer has some offsetting loss deduction.

---

## Question 4: Conversion (Ordinary vs. Capital Gain; Vesting; 83(b))

### A. Which would a taxpayer rather receive: ordinary income or capital gain?

**Capital gain** (usually): lower rate and often deferral until realization.

### B. Emma buys stock with after-tax salary and sells for a $5k profit. Ordinary or capital gain?

**Capital gain** (simplified). Nuance:
- If held long enough, it is typically “long-term” capital gain (lower rate).
- If sold quickly, it can be “short-term” and taxed like ordinary income.

### C. What changes if ABC gives Emma the stock subject to 12-month vesting (worth $15k at vesting)?

**Tax is delayed until vesting, and then treated like compensation.**

- Emma includes **$90,000 of ordinary income** currently (cash salary).
- At vesting, Emma includes **$15,000 of ordinary income** (the stock’s value when it vests).
- The “appreciation” from $10k to $15k gets pulled into **ordinary income** because the tax system treats it as value received for services once the condition is met.

### D. Does vesting increase or reduce Emma’s tax bill (relative to buying stock herself)?

**It generally increases Emma’s tax bill** if the stock appreciates, because:

- Without vesting: the $5k increase looks like **capital gain**.
- With vesting: that same $5k is effectively taxed as **ordinary income** at vesting.

### E. Should Emma make an 83(b) election if she expects the stock to rise? Is this conversion?

**YES (if she expects appreciation and expects to satisfy vesting).**

**83(b) election:** pay tax **now** on the value at grant (e.g., $10k), not later on the higher value at vesting (e.g., $15k). Then future appreciation is capital gain.

Why it’s a conversion strategy:
- It converts the **future growth** from “ordinary at vesting” into **capital gain after grant**.

Key risks / frictions:
- If the stock falls, she may regret paying ordinary tax early.
- If she leaves and the stock never vests, she paid tax on value she doesn’t keep.
- She needs cash to pay the tax upfront.

### F. What is ABC’s deduction with and without 83(b)? Which is better for the employer?

**Employer deduction tracks what employee includes.**

- **No 83(b):** employee includes $15k at vesting → employer deducts **$15k** for the stock
- **83(b):** employee includes $10k at grant → employer deducts **$10k** for the stock

**Which is better for the employer?** Usually **no 83(b)** is better for the employer if the stock appreciates (bigger deduction).

## Question 5: Deferral (Why Timing Matters; Present Value Math; Invoice Timing)

### A. Loan concerns: if you lend $10,000 to your neighbor, what do you worry about?

- **Credit risk:** she might not repay
- **Liquidity risk:** you might need the cash sooner than you expect
- **Time value / opportunity cost:** you could have invested it
- **Interest:** you generally want compensation for these risks

### B. Why prefer paying a tax next year instead of this year (same rate)?

**Deferral reduces the present value of the tax.** You keep the money longer and can earn returns on it (like an interest-free loan from the government).

### C. Funding a $10,000 obligation in one year (50% tax rate; 10% interest)

**i. Do you need to invest $10,000 today?**

**Less.** The investment grows.

**ii. If you invest $9,524, what happens after one year?**

- Pretax interest: $9,524 × 10% = **$952.40**
- Tax on interest (50%): **$476.20**
- After-tax interest: **$476.20**
- Ending value: $9,524 + $476.20 = **$10,000.20** (≈ $10,000)

**iii. Present value of $10,000 in one year at 5%?**

**$10,000 / 1.05 = $9,523.81** (≈ **$9,524**)

**iv. If the obligation is in two years, do you still need $9,524 today?**

**No — you need less today.** With more time, compounding does more work.

**v. How much will you have in two years if you set aside $9,070 today (5% after-tax return)?**

**$9,070 × (1.05)^2 = $9,999.68** (≈ **$10,000**)

### D. “Deferring a tax reduces its present value.”

**AGREE.**

### E. Is deferral more powerful as the deferral period grows?

**YES.** More time → more compounding → bigger present value advantage.

### F. Same setup but interest rates are 2% (so 1% after tax). If you set aside $9,901, what happens?

- Pretax interest: $9,901 × 2% = **$198.02**
- Tax on interest (50%): **$99.01**
- After-tax interest: **$99.01**
- Ending value: $9,901 + $99.01 = **$10,000.01** (≈ $10,000)

### G. Present value of $10,000 in one year at 1%?

**$10,000 / 1.01 = $9,900.99** (≈ **$9,901**)

### H. Is deferral more powerful as interest rates rise?

**YES.** Higher interest rates make the “keep the money longer” advantage bigger.

### I. Fran (cash method) is about to invoice in late November. What advice?

**If she wants deferral, invoice later (e.g., January)** so receipt falls in the next tax year.

But flag frictions:
- She may need the cash now.
- She may not want to upset George or look unprofessional.
- Real rules can include “constructive receipt” and other limits (not in the hypo, but worth remembering).

## Question 6: Shifting (High-Rate Parent → Lower-Rate Child)

### A. Diane taxed at 37% on $10,000 interest. After-tax income?

**$10,000 × (1 − 0.37) = $6,300.**

### B. If Diane gives Eric the bonds, what happens to the $10,000 interest?

Eric tax (22%):
- Tax: $10,000 × 0.22 = **$2,200**
- After-tax: **$7,800**

### C. Which alternative reduces their combined tax and gets Eric the most money?

**Giving Eric the bonds** (shifts income into a lower bracket).

### D. Non-tax reasons Diane might hesitate?

Common frictions:
- **Loss of control** over the asset (Eric could sell/spend)
- **Family dynamics** / reliability concerns
- **Creditor/divorce risk** for Eric
- **Gift/estate planning constraints** (real-world legal/tax rules can limit “free” shifting)

---

## Question 7: Shifting (Multinationals)

### A. Baseline: $300 profit taxed in U.S. at 21%. Tax per phone?

**$300 × 0.21 = $63.**

### B. Is shifting to IrishSub at 12.5% attractive?

**YES.** Lower tax rate means lower tax on shifted income.

### C. If Parent pays $100/phone of deductible interest to IrishSub, what happens?

- U.S. taxable income: $300 − $100 = **$200** → U.S. tax: $200 × 0.21 = **$42**
- Ireland taxable income: **$100** → Ireland tax: $100 × 0.125 = **$12.50**
- Total tax: **$54.50**
- Savings vs. baseline: $63.00 − $54.50 = **$8.50 per phone**

### D. Add a $150 royalty too (so $250 shifted total). What happens?

- U.S. taxable income: $300 − $100 − $150 = **$50** → U.S. tax: $50 × 0.21 = **$10.50**
- Ireland taxable income: $100 + $150 = **$250** → Ireland tax: $250 × 0.125 = **$31.25**
- Total tax: **$41.75**
- Savings vs. baseline: $63.00 − $41.75 = **$21.25 per phone**

### E. If the U.S. corporate rate drops (35% → 21%), what happens to incentives to shift?

**Incentives to shift decrease** when the U.S. rate falls, because the benefit is roughly:

**Tax savings ≈ (U.S. rate − foreign rate) × income shifted**

Smaller rate gap → smaller savings.

---

## Question 8: Frictions (When “Good Tax Planning” Isn’t Worth It)

### A. Fran: why might she ignore the “invoice in January” advice?

- She needs cash now (liquidity).
- She’s paying high-interest debt (the interest cost can exceed tax savings).
- She worries about relationship/reputational harm with George.

### B. Diane: why might she not give Eric the bonds even if it’s tax-efficient?

- She doesn’t want to surrender control.
- She worries Eric will misuse the asset or become vulnerable to creditors/divorce.

### C. Multinational: what if Congress requires engineers to work in Ireland to tax profits there?

That requirement creates huge frictions:
- relocation costs
- talent loss / employee refusal
- operational inefficiency

So yes, it would matter a lot and would reduce shifting.

### D. “Goal is maximize after-tax returns, not minimize taxes.”

**AGREE.** Sometimes paying more tax is rational if it helps you make more money overall.

---

## Question 9: All Parties (Timing Strategies Need Cooperation)

### A. George is also cash method and can deduct the payment. Does he care about timing?

**YES — and his preference is often the opposite of Fran’s.**

- Fran wants payment later (defers tax).
- George may want to pay earlier (accelerates deduction).

### B. If they’re in the same tax bracket, is there any tax advantage to changing timing?

**Generally, NO.** One party’s deduction is the other party’s income at the same rate, so it washes out on a combined basis.

### C. What if Fran is paid by a nonprofit (tax-exempt)?

**That can create a real net benefit.** The nonprofit is closer to a “tax indifferent” party, so:

- Fran can benefit from deferral
- the nonprofit may not care (or care less) about the deduction timing

### D. What is a “tax accommodation party” / “tax indifferent party” (TIP)? Example?

**Tax accommodation party / tax indifferent party (TIP):** a party for whom the relevant tax issue (rate/timing/deduction) matters little or not at all, so they can “lend” their favorable tax status to the deal structure.

Examples:
- nonprofits
- entities with net operating losses (NOLs) that already pay little/no tax
- certain foreign entities under different tax regimes

## Key Takeaways

- Tax planning is regulatory arbitrage: **same economics, different tax labels**.
- The main tools are **Exclusion, Valuation, Conversion, Deferral, Shifting**.
- Always compute consequences for **both sides** (and sometimes multiple jurisdictions).
- Always ask: **Do frictions outweigh tax savings?**
- Expect bargaining: **tax savings usually get shared** when cooperation is needed.

---

## Notes for Class Discussion

- When cold-called, start with a clean structure: **(1) taxable base, (2) rate, (3) timing** — then compute **before vs. after**.
- Keep repeating the cross-cutting checks: **all parties** and **frictions**.
- Good “connecting” line to Class 1: lawyers add value by designing structures that address information/incentive problems *and* by choosing legal forms with better regulatory treatment.
