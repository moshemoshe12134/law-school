Property investments are highly capital intensive, and any mistakes made
during the process can cause a great deal of trouble to the buyer. This
makes it imperative for a buyer to exercise [[due
caution]{.underline}](https://housing.com/news/advisable-take-legal-opinion-buying-property/) 
while examining the property documents. With proper [[legal
advice]{.underline}](https://housing.com/news/legal-taxation-aspects-consider-selling-residential-property/),
scrutiny of documents and verification of relevant information
pertaining to the property, the buyer can ensure that the investment
brings peace of mind and a sense of security.

In this article, we talk at length about the documents a buyer has to
seek and examine before he is ready to sign a deal.

 

 

**1. Property documents checklist**

It is a settled legal principle that a person cannot convey a better
title, than what he himself has. As a first step, the buyer should
undertake due diligence, to ascertain the existence of the title with
the seller, the nature of the title and its marketability and the
ability of the seller to convey clear and marketable title, free from
encumbrance. Documents, for a period of 30 years, if not more (and where
documents are not available, for minimum period of 12 years), must be
examined and the seller may be called upon to provide the following
documents / information:

i.  **Title documents of the property:**  Government order for grant,
    succession certificate, sale deed, gift deed, will, partition deed,
    etc., evidencing the transfer of title over the years, culminating
    in the vesting of property with the seller.

ii. **Nature of title:** Leasehold, freehold, or development right.

iii. In case of the seller claiming development rights to the property,
     the development agreement and power of attorney, executed by the
     owners in favour of the seller.

iv. All [[title
    documents]{.underline}](https://housing.com/news/commonly-used-land-and-revenue-record-terms-in-india/) being
    duly stamped and registered at the office of the jurisdictional
    sub-registrar of assurances.

v.  Khata registered in the name of the seller.

vi. Information on pending or past litigation.

vii. Availability of original title documents with the seller.

 

**2. Verify the identity of the seller**

Similar to verifying the title to the property, the buyer should also
ascertain the identity of the seller and any specific conditions,
governing the ability of the seller to convey the property. The
following instances may be noted for illustration:

i.  Residence status and nationality of the seller, in case of an
    individual and whether consents from government authorities are
    required for the sale.

ii. Identification of all owners, in case of properties held jointly.

iii. Where the seller is a company, trust, partnership firm, society,
     etc. The constitution documents of the entity are necessary to
     confirm its ability to own and transfer the property, besides
     ascertaining that the person executing and registering the sale
     deed is duly authorised.

iv. Orders from the competent court, permitting sale of the property and
    appointing a guardian, where the property is held by a minor or
    person of unsound mind.

 

**3. Conversion and land-use permissions**

With increasing urbanisation and merging of revenue lands with urban
conglomerates, conversion of property for non-agricultural use assumes
crucial significance, since several state laws restrict purchase of
agricultural property by non-agriculturists. Secondly, the buyer must
examine the Master Plan and satisfy that the property is developed in
accordance with the zoning plan -- such as residential, commercial,
industrial, public/semi-public, parks and open spaces, etc. Where actual
use is different from the notified zoning, obtaining orders from the
Town Planning Authority permitting change of land use, is mandatory.

 

**4. Construction approvals**

For purchase of apartment or land with constructed building, the buyer
should also scrutinise the building plan / layout plan sanctioned by the
local municipal authorities, along with approvals issued by government,
statutory and regulatory authorities, for providing infrastructure
facilities, water, sewage, electricity, environmental clearance, fire
safety approval, etc.

 

**5. Occupancy certificate**

It is mandatory for the seller to obtain the [[occupancy
certificate]{.underline}](https://housing.com/news/real-estate-basics-occupancy-certificate/) from
the competent authority, prior to conveying the property. Use of the
property, without obtaining occupancy, exposes the buyer to penalty
under the applicable building bye-laws, besides the risk of demolition
of the property.

 

**6. Status of tax payment**

Non-payment of [[property
taxes]{.underline}](https://housing.com/news/property-tax-calculated/) constitute
a charge on the property, affecting its marketability. So, the buyer
must verify with the municipal authorities that the seller has not
defaulted on payment of property taxes.

Do ask for the receipts of all utility bills from the seller. Please
note here that once the property is transferred in your name, you will
be liable to pay all pending dues against the property, utility or
otherwise.

 

**7. Encumbrance**

Searches at the jurisdictional sub-registrar office or the official web
portal of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (if the seller is a company)
will reveal information of any [[registered
encumbrance]{.underline}](https://housing.com/news/real-estate-basics-encumbrance-certificate/) on
the property. By way of caution, the purchaser may also issue public
notice in newspapers, prior to completing the transaction, calling for
claims from interested third parties, if any.

 

**8. Physical survey and access to the property**

The buyer may undertake a [[physical
survey]{.underline}](https://housing.com/news/site-visits-can-developers-bar-home-buyers-from-checking-construction-progress/) and
confirm the extent and measurement of the property. In the case of land,
it is advisable to identify and demarcate the boundaries and access to
the property and further, ascertain any other physical attributes that
may impede enjoyment of the property.

 

**9. Compliance under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act,
2016 (RERA)**

[[The RERA
mandates]{.underline}](https://housing.com/news/rera-will-impact-real-estate-industry/) that
developers should register their projects with the authority constituted
under the Act. A buyer, intending to buy a property in a project coming
under the ambit of the RERA is advised to verify whether property has
been registered with the authority. Information available on the
official web portal of RERA for each state also provides details of any
cases / complaints filed against the developer of the project and
default by developer, if any and thus, provides useful insight into the
credibility of the developer and the project and helps the buyer make an
informed choice.

Buyers should take note of the fact that the law mandates that all real
estate brokers should also be registered with the state RERA, in order
to operate legally. Hence, hire a property broker, only after asking for
his RERA registration. Also, note that agents need to get their RERA
registrations renewed, periodically. Ensure that you are dealing with
the right person. One of the biggest benefits of having a regulatory
body is that it requires a standard process of operation and violators
are penalised.

 

**Risks of proceeding with a property purchase without due diligence**

Unless you are absolutely certain of the credentials of the seller and
his ownership over the asset is duly testified by documentary proof, a
buyer should avoid getting into a deal, irrespective of how lucrative it
might seem. Sometimes, people try to sell disputed properties at low
prices. This prospect might seem attractive in the beginning but would
eventually prove to be a major headache. Also, never engage with a
seller who wants you to use unaccounted money to make the purchase in
order to save taxes. This could also lead to a lot of future troubles.

**Some quick tips for buyers:**

- Never agree to sign on the dotted line, without doing your own
  research.

- Even if an agent or a developer is recommended by people know to you,
  check their RERA ID and registration.

- Never agree to offer money in black, in lieu of tax discounts.

- Do not agree to buy/sell a property on someone else's behalf.

 

**Should I check the PoA?**

PoA stands for Power of Attorney and this is a legal instrument that
gives another person the authority to act as a legal owner, on behalf of
the actual owner. If you are buying a property, make sure that you check
these documents, to ascertain the rights of the PoA holder.

 

**Do banks do due diligence on the buyer's behalf?**

If you are a prospective home buyer, who has submitted their
documentation and papers with a bank and looking forward to your home
loan being sanctioned, rest assured, your bank will do the due
diligence. However, do not leave it to the bank altogether. The number
of property-related cases that find their way into Indian courts every
year, is a reminder that one must be careful throughout the home buying
journey.
