EX ANTE INFORMATION CHALLENGES

The negotiation model described in Chapter 1 implicitly assumes
that each party to a deal knows the value it places on the asset under
negotiation. Often, however, this is not the case. Information about
what is being exchanged may be imperfect. Typically, the seller is
better informed about the value of what it is selling, but there are
also situations in which the buyer has better information. Either way,
there can be a problem of asymmetric information. Itis also common
for both the buyer and the seller to lack information regarding the
value of the asset, so there may be symmetric uncertainty. Either asym-
metric information or symmetric uncertainty can keep a value-
increasing deal from being made. Parties to a deal, therefore, will
not only want to improve their own information, they will also want
to improve the other party's information. But there will be a degree
of irreducible uncertainty due to unknown facts and future events.
The parties must also negotiate how they will allocate the cost of

that uncertainty.

Asymmetric Information

Information asymmetry can threaten even the simplest deals, like
the used car transaction described in Chapter 1. In that situation,
Sarah as the hopeful seller certainly knows more than Jim, the pro-
spective buyer, about the car’s quality. Let’s assume the car has never
been involved in an accident or shown signs of being defective.

Ex Ante Information Challenges 19

Sarah has always taken it in for routine maintenance according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations, and parked it under a roof.
She knows the car is in great shape and should fetch a price that
reflects its value. Jim, however, is wary. Even if Sarah describes her
loving care of the car, he might understandably discount her claims.
Wouldn't anyone selling a used car give the same kind of report?
Isn't there a chance that Sarah is saying she must sell the car because
she is moving to France, when the real reason is that the car is no
good? Racked by such doubts, Jim may make Sarah an offer too low
for her to accept. And thus the chance could be lost for a deal that
would be made easily if Jim had complete knowledge of the quality
of Sarah's car. The asymmetry of information may yield an outcome
that is unfortunate for both of them.

The problem of asymmetric information was first studied in the
insurance context, where the term adverse selection was coined to de-
scribe what can happen when participants on one side of a market
have information relevant to the value of an offering that the other
side lacks.! This is the situation in the health insurance context,
where potential policy buyers have more information related to
their upcoming health care needs than an insurer does. People with
the greatest health care needs are most likely to seek insurance—to
“select” into the insurance market. As a result, the insurer faces a
profile of applicants that will be more costly to insure than the
population as a whole. This situation is “adverse” to the insurer's
interest because the insurer does not know who selects into the
market for this reason or how costly their care will be.

If the insurer could easily identify those high-risk applicants, it
could price their policies in line with the expected costs of insuring
them. But because the insurer cannot identify them, it rolls them
into a larger group of policyholders, all of whom are charged a price
sufficient to cover the expenses imposed by the high-cost members.
Knowing that they, in effect, would be paying the health care costs
of higher-risk policyholders, some healthy people select out and


20 DEALS

choose to go without insurance. Those remaining then skew the
insured group even further into high-risk territory, with higher pre-
miums needed to cover the insurer’s costs. There will be some low-
cost customers who choose to be insured because they place an
especially high value on insuring themselves, but others will choose
to be uninsured.

Legally mandated insurance, such as auto insurance, and man-
datory employer-based health insurance are responses to this
problem. They avoid adverse selection by requiring everyone,
whether low- or high-risk, to join the pool of policyholders.

George Akerlof, in his famous article “The Market for ‘Lemons,”
provides an economic model of adverse selection, with the used car
market as an illustrative setting? The motivation for the analysis is
the question: Why does a new car lose such a substantial portion
of its initial value the moment a buyer drives it off the lot? Akerlof
offers an explanation unrelated to consumers’ preference for new
things or prestige. As he shows, the problem is that, as soon as a
consumer has taken ownership of the car, the car moves from one

market to a different market—a used-car market so shaped by in-
formation asymmetry that the worst-quality cars dictate the price
that will be paid for any used car.

Akerlof starts by dividing the world of cars into new and used
cars, and good and bad cars. In a new car transaction, there are
randomly good and bad cars, but neither the buyer nor the seller
has insight into whether a particular vehicle is a good or bad one.
The price of a new car reflects the market's estimate of the average
quality of a car model without reference to the specific vehicle in
question. The used car market is different. The seller of a used car
knows the car’s prior driving history—whether a car is good or
bad—while a potential buyer does not. The seller can share infor-

mation about the car, but can the buyer believe it? The seller wants
to make a sale for as high a price as possible, and therefore has an
incentive to exaggerate the good, omit the bad, and perhaps lie

Ex Ante Information Challenges 21

outright. Unable to know the quality of a used car, the buyer im-
plicitly discounts its value to account for the probability that it is
of poor quality. Sellers of high-quality cars, therefore, are not able
to sell their cars for their actual value, and many choose to keep their
cars rather than sell them. Dropping the simplifying assumption of
there being just two types of cars in the used car market, Akerlof
shows that, in theory, better cars will be continuously taken off
the market, and the average quality of cars will continuously dete-
riorate. The logical conclusion is that a market for used cars cannot
exist—except perhaps for the very worst cars. Car owners who would
like to sell their cars before they fully deteriorate, and individuals
who would like to buy high-quality or medium-quality used cars
will be unable to make deals with one another unless they can sub-
stantially reduce the information asymmetry, which of course real-
world buyers and sellers find ways to do.

The negotiations literature has shown that adverse selection can
be amplified in the bargaining process. Imagine that Sarah and Jim
tentatively agree on a price of $8,500 for the car. Neither party knows
this, but that price is exactly in the middle of their zone of possible
agreement, with each party getting $500 of surplus relative to
their BATNA. But now a thought crosses Jim’s mind: Sarah knows
more about the car than I do, so if she is willing to sell it for $8,500,
it must not be worth that much. This phenomenon is known as re-
active devaluation? The seller’s signal of receptivity to a deal provides
new information that can lead the buyer rationally to reconsider
its terms.

Of course, if taken to the extreme, reactive devaluation would
be a complete barrier to any deal’s getting done when there is in-
formation asymmetry between seller and buyer. The point is made
succinctly in the movie A Civil Action, when John Travolta tries to
persuade his co-counsel, William H. Macy, that they should not ac-
cept an $8 million settlement offer proffered by the defendant. “If
they're willing to pay eight,” he reasons, “then it’s not enough, is it?”


22 DEALS

Macy responds to Travolta: “Oh, that makes sense. That makes
perfect sense. So, the only thing you'll accept is what they’re not
willing to give us. Listen to yourself!”* As an empirical matter, re-
active devaluation does not occur in all deals, and as a prescriptive
matter it shouldn't. If there is reason to believe that the buyer
places a value on the asset higher than the seller’s minimum, and
the ZOPA is reasonably wide, a seller’s acceptance of a deal does
not imply that the deal is bad for the buyer.

Asymmetric information is pervasive in business deals, which
often involve valuation challenges more complicated than assessing
the value of a car. Consider the sale of an entire company, where
determining value requires information about its assets, liabilities,
business prospects, potential future liabilities, and more. The seller
of the business typically knows much of this information—or, if
not, it can acquire the information more easily than the buyer can.
The same is true when a business is selling equity to an investor.
Similarly, in the debt market, a borrower has more information rel-
evant to the risk of default than the lender has. Or consider the case
of a biotech company that is developing a drug. It is seeking an
arrangement with a pharmaceutical company whereby the latter
finances the drug’s development and then, if the drug receives reg-
ulatory approval, it handles manufacturing and distribution. Each
side of this deal has knowledge the other lacks. While the biotech
company may know more about the biology of the drug, the pharma
company will know more about manufacturing costs and the com-
petitive landscape. Depending on the context, information asym-
metry can run in either direction.

Symmetric Uncertainty

There are also situations in which both parties lack information on
some salient aspect of a deal. Imagine, for example, that Sarah her-
self has come into possession of the car because her elderly father

Ex Ante Information Challenges 23

has decided his driving days are over and signed the title over
to her. If Sarah knows nothing about whether her father has had
problems with the car, she and Jim are equally uninformed. Un-
certainty regarding the quality of the car is symmetrical. In this
situation, they may or may not reach a deal. Jim will discount the
car as he would ordinarily, given the probability of badness he as-
signs to it, and Sarah, equally lacking information, will also dis-
count the car’s value to some degree, but their discounts may not be
the same.

In a complex business deal, symmetric uncertainty on certain
points can coexist with asymmetric information about others. In
the sale of a large corporation with worldwide operations, a seller’s
management surely knows a lot about the business being sold, but
there can still be important questions to which it does not have the
answers. It may not know with certainty whether, somewhere in its
far-flung operations, it is unwittingly violating someone else's in-
tellectual property or violating local law. These are also matters of
which the buyer is ignorant, so the two sides face symmetric uncer-
tainty to a degree.

Where information about a possible exchange is incomplete, the
parties must find ways to obtain sufficient information to move for-
ward with a deal. And to the extent uncertainty is irreducible, they
must come to an agreement on how they will allocate the cost of
that uncertainty. As we will see, the process of negotiating that al-
location can complicate how the parties provide information to
each other.

Responses to Incomplete Information

In response to incomplete information, whether asymmetric
information or symmetric uncertainty, parties must find ways
to inform themselves—and each other, since, as noted above, an
information advantage may not actually be advantageous. In

greater consequences than Benjamin realizes. If he chooses offer
number one, we predict that ABC will cut its losses and walk away
altogether. But if he chooses offer number two, ABC will move for-
ward to sort out the details and quickly provide financing.

Why? By choosing offer number one, Benjamin would convey
information to ABC regarding his lack of confidence that ARROW’s
challenges could be overcome within six months. Or at least ABC
could reasonably interpret his choice this way. If Benjamin in-
stead chose offer number two, he would signal confidence in his six-
month projection. That signal would be backed up by the fact that,
if he were wrong and ARROW failed to meet its six-month target,
Benjamin would pay a high price. He would have no leeway, and
his company would likely fail. The signal of choosing offer number
two would thus credibly convey information regarding Benjamin's
confidence.

In this deal, ABC faces an asymmetry of information with
Benjamin. It responds to that asymmetry by forcing Benjamin to
convey his private information regarding ARROW’s prospects.
Benjamin will either convey confidence, or he won't. ABC will then
respond to information it receives by either moving forward with
a deal or not. Of course, Benjamin could convey the same infor-
mation at the outset by asking for only six months of financing.
Either way, a credible signal of Benjamin's confidence will be sent.
In other situations, information is conveyed more directly, but it
still must be conveyed credibly. There must be a cost to conveying
false information.

Direct Disclosure of Information

The most straightforward way of addressing incomplete informa-
tion is for the party in possession of the information simply to dis-
close it to the other. The seller in a used car deal, for example,
can compile maintenance and repair records to share with the

skinning

Sains

Ex Ante Information Challenges 27

potential buyer. In many types of transactions, such as corporate
loans and corporate acquisitions, information is conveyed by page
after page of representations and warranties, and accompanying
disclosure schedules. When a company is acquired, for example,
the seller's “reps and warranties” (or, even shorter, just “reps”) and
its disclosure schedules convey details regarding the business, as-
sets, liabilities, and potential liabilities of the company being sold.
‘The standard format provides reps subject to exceptions listed in the
accompanying disclosure schedule. For example, a rep may state
that “except as listed in the disclosure schedule, there is no litiga-
tion pending against the company.’ The disclosure schedule then
lists all the pending litigation.

Reps and disclosure schedules are often voluminous and detailed.
They typically include a statement that the company’s financial
statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP in the US, usually IFRS elsewhere),
and that they fairly present the company’s financial position. The reps
disclose the company’s potential tax obligations, its contractual
rights and obligations, its compliance with environmental laws, its
pension liabilities, its ownership of intellectual property, whether
it has any labor disputes, and many other matters that influence
its value. The reps also include an attestation that the company’s
performance has not changed materially since its last financial
statements.

Whether a buyer is negotiating to acquire a car or to take owner-
ship of an entire business, however, that buyer must be able to rely on
the seller's representations. In extreme cases of deception, of course,
the managers of a selling business might face prosecution for crim-
inal or civil fraud, but these situations are rare.

For a seller's reps to be credible, the seller must face a substantial
cost if the information it conveys turns out to be false. When a pri-
vately held company is sold, this is accomplished by having the


28 DEALS

shareholders of the company indemnify the buyer against any losses
stemming from a false representation. The seller typically gives the
buyer a period of time after the acquisition to discover the problem
and make a claim, and it often puts cash in escrow to cover claims
that arise. The commitment to indemnify the buyer makes the sell-
er’s reps credible.

When a public company is sold, however, it is not feasible for a
seller to indemnify the buyer. The sellers are dispersed public
shareholders who are difficult to track down and who had nothing to
do with making the representations in the first place. The primary
mechanism that makes public company reps credible is the right
of the buyer to walk away from the deal before closing, if it finds that
a representation is false. In a public company sale, there is typically
a period of a few months between the day the buyer and seller sign an
acquisition agreement and the day the deal closes. The agreement
provides that if, during that time, the buyer discovers a representa-
tion by the seller to be materially false, the buyer has the right to
terminate the deal—to “walk” Between signing and closing, a buyer
continues collecting information about the business it is about
to purchase, and attempts specifically to verify what the seller has
represented.

A buyer walking away from a deal is costly to the seller’s man-
agement and shareholders. It sends a signal to the market that there
is something wrong with the target company. What exactly that
problem is might not be clear. The rep that the buyer finds to be
false might itself be the deal-breaker, because the corrected infor-
mation shows the company is not as good as the market thought it
was. Or perhaps the discovery of a false rep just provides the buyer
with a convenient, contractual excuse to walk away for an unrelated
reason——maybe because it has developed serious qualms about
something less tangible, Regardless, the market's response to a failed
merger is ugly: the seller’s share price falls and its managers, who
have made the false rep, bear costs through their shareholdings,

their stock-based compensation, and their reputations, Walk rights,
therefore, have teeth,

The case of Fresenius’s acquisition of Akorn illustrates the power
of walk rights in an extreme form. In April 2017, Fresenius Kabi AG,
a large German pharmaceutical company, agreed to acquire Akorn,
Tnc., a smaller pharma company based in the United States, for
approximately $4.3 billion, Akorn made extensive representations in
the acquisition agreement regarding its compliance with applicable
regulatory requirements—a critical concern for the acquiror of any
pharma company. In October 2017, before the deal closed, Frese-
nius received an anonymous letter that raised questions as to
whether Akorn was indeed in regulatory compliance. Fresenius in-
vestigated these allegations and discovered serious data integrity
problems at Akorn. In April 2018, Fresenius gave notice that it was
terminating the merger agreement, claiming that the regulatory
compliance representation was untrue and the noncompliance was
material to the company’s future profitability and present value.

Akorn took Fresenius to court, arguing that Fresenius had no
right to terminate its agreement. But the Delaware Chancery Court
disagreed and let Fresenius walk.® With this ruling, Akorn—which
had already lost about 45 percent ofits share value when Fresenius
announced it was walking away from the deal—lost another
45 percent, for a total decline of 90 percent from its pre-deal value,
And with its regulatory noncompliance now on public display,
Akorn was damaged goods in the marketplace. In May 2020 it filed
for bankruptcy,

Ina sale of a company, the threat of individual liability can also
play a role in providing assurance to buyers. When a Private com-
pany is being sold, the acquiror may demand affirmation of a target
company’s representations by its controlling shareholder or share-
holders, thereby exposing them to liability if a rep turns out to be
false. In a sale of a public company, terms can be written into the
acquisition agreement by which specified senior officers of the com-


30 DEALS

pany stand to be held personally liable if they are found to have
intentionally deceived the buyer.

Self-Help

Another way in which parties reduce information asymmetry is by
collecting information themselves, often with the cooperation of
their counterparty, through the process known as due diligence. In
any deal, there is an initial period of investigation during which the
buyer determines whether it is interested. In an acquisition, that pe-
riod may begin with a tentative price proposed by the seller and a
tentative expression of interest by the buyer, subject to due diligence.
The initial period often ends with a nonbinding term sheet or letter
of intent that sets a price and spells out other major points of the
deal—all subject to the buyer’s eventual agreement after further
investigation.

Due diligence at the initial stage and throughout the dealmaking
process is costly—and the more time-consuming and costly it is,
the less likely the buyer is to engage in the process. Rather than
incurring the cost, a buyer may lose interest in a deal, or may
make a low offer that takes into account its minimal due diligence
has been inadequate and its information is highly incomplete.
Assuming the seller wants the deal to move forward on terms it
will find attractive, it will try to make the buyer’s due diligence
as easy and productive as possible. At some point in the process,
the two may also enter into a time-limited exclusivity agreement,
which provides the buyer with some assurance that, if it invests
in due diligence and is happy with what it finds, it will be able to
go forward with the deal. Without an exclusivity agreement, the
buyer might invest heavily in due diligence only to lose the deal to
another party.

If the buyer and seller reach a preliminary agreement, they go on
to negotiate and draft a full, definitive agreement, complete with
the seller’s representations and warranties. The buyer's due diligence

Ex Ante Information Challenges 31

continues, however, up until the time of closing. The buyer's right
to walk—and hence, the seller's reps and warranties—work because
of the buyer's continued due diligence. To walk, the buyer must dis-
cover that one or more of the seller’s reps is untrue; and to induce
the seller to take care in making truthful reps, the buyer must make
it clear that due diligence efforts will continue.

A buyer engages in due diligence not only to validate informa-
tion the seller has conveyed, but also because there is some infor-
mation that a seller cannot credibly disclose. For example, while the
seller ofa business can represent that a list of contracts with customers
and suppliers is complete, and it can disclose the terms of those
contracts, the seller cannot effectively represent that its relation-
ships with customers and suppliers are good, which of course can
be important to the value of a business. The buyer will need to get
that information itself by speaking with the parties with which the
seller has contracted.

Outside the context of mergers and acquisitions, some deals rely
more on due diligence than on a seller conveying information to a
buyer. Some acquisitions of land are examples. The following case is
loosely based on Mattei v. Hopper, a legal dispute from the 1950s
that remains in many law school textbooks today, and featuring a
legal issue that continues to be litigated today (though that issue is
not the point of the story here).?

Peter Mattei was interested in buying an undeveloped tract of
land on which to build a shopping center. But he did not want to
buy the land unless he knew he could enter into a lease with an at-
tractive anchor tenant on terms that suited his plans for the shop-
ping center. He entered into a deal with Amelia Hopper, the owner
of the land, under which he would pay an agreed upon price sub-
ject to the condition that he was free to walk away if, in his sole dis-
cretion, he determined that he could not enter into a suitable lease
with an attractive anchor tenant. In effect, Mattei had a free option
to buy the land. The term for this arrangement is a free look.

wisi


32 DEALS

The free look allows a buyer to incur due diligence expense with
assurance that it can buy the land at an agreed-upon price if the
results of the due diligence justify doing so. But this assurance
comes at a cost to the seller. The seller has to take the property off
the market while the free look is in effect, and therefore loses the
possibility of getting a better deal during that time. So, what does
a seller get out of giving a buyer a free look? Some courts have con-
cluded that the seller gets nothing in return for its commitment to
the buyer. Based on this understanding, they have ruled that these
agreements are not enforceable contracts, (To be enforceable, a con-
tract must provide a benefit to both parties.) But this view of the
free look reflects a misunderstanding of the economics of the deal.
What a free look provides to a seller is a greater likelihood of selling
its land for the agreed-upon price, or equivalently, the opportunity
to sell the land at a price higher than it could without the free look.
The free look gets the buyer and seller past an information hurdle that
would otherwise result in a less valuable deal to the seller, or no deal
at all. In effect, the seller is paying the buyer to collect the informa-
tion it needs to justify the price the seller seeks,

‘The free look, however, raises a couple of issues. First, could the
seller provide a buyer with the information he needs? If the buyer
is concerned about groundwater pollution or soil content, perhaps
it could. But there is no way for a seller to assure a buyer that it will be
able to sign a lease with an attractive anchor tenant on attractive
terms. This is something the buyer will have to determine for itself.
Tt will have to actually negotiate a lease with a prospective tenant,
and the only feasible way of doing that is to assure a would-be
tenant that the buyer will close the deal on the land if they reach
an agreement on the lease.

Second, why is the free look free? In a hot market, the cost of
taking a property off the market could outweigh whatever gain
would result from a sale following the free look. A fee can make up
for the difference. In fact, in some real estate deals, the seller charges

Ex Ante Information Challenges 33

a fee for the look, which it waives if the buyer goes through with
the purchase,

Third-Party Assurance

Parties to a deal may also rely on third parties to provide informa-
tion. In a used car sale, a buyer may ask a mechanic to inspect the car.
In business transactions, buyers and sellers commonly retain ac-
countants, investment bankers, and lawyers to provide information
upon which they rely, For exam le, a common third-party assurance

Legal opinions of seller’s counsel are common, as well. These opin-
ions can address the seller’s title to assets it purports to own, the
absence of contractual restrictions on sale, and other legal issues
related to the consummation of the transaction and what the buyer
will get when the deal is done.

Assuming no attempt at outright fraud, both buyer and seller
have a mutual interest in engaging a third party whose credibility
is well established. Third Parties that are successful at credibly con-
veying information generally share three characteristics: they have
expertise in their field; they are recognized as objective and impar-
tial; and they have a Teputation that they will put in jeopardy if the
information they provide turns out to be untrue.

In some situations, a third-party assurance can be indirect but
still highly effective. Consider the following “slate financing” deal
between a prominent Hollywood producer and a group of hedge
funds. The former Proposed to produce a slate of fifteen yet-to-be-
selected movies over five years, for which the latter would provide
financing. Deals like this face a number of challenges, as will be-
come clear with a closer look at this deal in Chapter 4. For our pur-
Poses here, note that one problem for the producer was to convince
investors that they were dealing with someone with an exceptional
ability to select good scripts and make good movies. Of course, the
investors could see the movies the producer had produced in the


34 DEALS

past, but that would not be enough to show them a success rate.
Perhaps there were many other Projects that never made it to the
screen. The producer could put the investors in touch with others in
Hollywood who would provide glowing references, but such at-
testations would be of questionable credibility.

Instead, the producer built third-party assurance into the terms
of the financing agreement. The agreement provided that, prior to
closing, the producer must have in place an agreement witha major
film studio to advertise and distribute all the films in the slate. Fur-
thermore, that agreement would have to include commitments
by the studio to distribute all movies in the slate to a specified min-
imum number of movie theaters, and to spend at least a specified
amount on advertising.

This commitment would be costly for the studio. Roughly ninety
percent of advertising expenses are incurred before a movie is re-
leased, so a great deal of money can be lost advertising a movie that
turns out to be a dud. There are high opportunity costs, too, since
there is a limit to the number of movies a studio can distribute at
any time, Committing itself to this producer's full slate of movies
would mean that the studio could not distribute other movies. And
committing to a slate without knowing the content of the films
would run the risk that some of those films would compete directly
with other movies the studio would want to distribute. The studio
would not agree to these terms unless, based on its prior experience,
it truly expected good movies from this producer. The studio’s
commitment also ensured the investors that scarce theater spots
would be available for the movies in the slate, but that assurance
was a consequence of the studio having faith in the quality of the
producer's movies.

Price Discovery via Auction

When it is the seller who is uncertain about the value of an asset,
an alternative to investigating the value of the asset or seeking the

£

Fae

Ex Ante Information Challenges 35

assistance of a third party might be to put the asset up for auction.
In effect, potential buyers will inform the seller of the asset’s value
via their bids. Auctions can be complicated, but where they work
well, the seller can remain blissfully ignorant of the assets value until
competitive bidding provides the answer. In economics terms, an
auction can under certain conditions be an effective mechanism
for price discovery,

Three factors that determine an auction's ability to perform this
function include the cost of bidding, the extent to which potential
bidders are informed regarding the value of the asset being sold,
and the number of potential bidders that participate in the auction,
Regarding the first, Participating in an auction is not costless—it
involves at least some investment in evaluating the asset up for sale
and deciding how high to bid for it. If an asset is complex and dif-
ficult to value, potentially interested buyers may be deterred from
taking part. A seller can often respond to this Possibility by making
whatever information it does have easily available to bidders, or by
engaging an expert third party to attest to the asset’s condition, au-
thenticity, or other qualities. An auction needs enough bidders but
not too many. Too few bidders can be problematic if those partici-
pating do not include parties that will potentially value the asset
highly, that will become informed of its value, and that will have
sufficient cash or financing to let the Price reach the value of the asset.
Too many bidders can also bea problem. The greater the number
of bidders, the less likely any one bidder will be to succeed, which
can deter bidders from Participating. A seller can respond to this
problem by Screening and limiting the number of bidders permitted
to make a bid.

Deal processes balance these competing concerns through a hy-
brid of negotiation and auction processes—what one of us has
called “negotiauction” deal Processes." For example, a buyer trying
to procure an information technology system might advertise a
Tequest for proposal, to which IT Providers could respond with


36 DEALS

first-round indications of interest. Based on these indications of in-
terest, the buyer might then winnow down the field of bidders to,
say, two or three and engage in one-on-one intensive negotiations
with each of them.

Agreeing to Wait and See

Finally, in some situations where parties face incomplete informa-
tion and cannot agree on a price for an asset, they may agree to
an initial payment at the time the asset changes hands, and then an
additional payment or payments after it has been used for a period
of time and its value has become clearer. Technology and trademark
licenses typically take this approach. Rather than trying to predict
the value that will be realized in the future and setting an upfront
price, the licensee pays the licensor an ongoing royalty while the
asset is used. ‘The royalty is typically based on unit sales or on rev-
enues generated from the sale of products that use the technology
or trademark.

Similarly, in some corporate acquisitions, parties agree to an ear-
nout or contingent value right (CVR)—mechanisms addressed in
detail in Chapter 3. These provide that the buyer will make a pay-
ment to the seller based on post-acquisition metrics designed to
measure the value of the acquired company over a period of time
following the acquisition. As we will see, however, neither mecha-
nism is as promising as it might appear at first glance.

When Uncertainty Is Irreducible

Ron Gilson, in a widely and rightfully acclaimed article, raised an
interesting question: Given that sellers have a strong interest in 1n-
forming buyers regarding the value of an asset being sold, why do
lawyers negotiating corporate acquisitions spend so much time
bickering over representations and warranties?” (Negotiating reps
and warranties is a task generally delegated to the parties’ lawyers.)

i
t
I

Shouldn't representations and warranties be worked out as a co-
operative effort to provide the buyer with information it needs to
justify paying the price the seller seeks? Gilson’s analysis and our
discussion above—now forty years later—suggests that it should
be. But, as Gilson recognized, it is not. Negotiating representations
and warranties is very adversarial. Why is that? Gilson did not
offer an answer, except to suggest that the lawyers are “seduced by
the prospect of combat”
Gilson’s read on lawyers negotiating reps and warranties may
well be correct—certainly with respect to some lawyers. But we
offer an additional explanation. There are certain facts about a com-
pany that the seller does not know and cannot discover without
inordinate time and effort. For example, buyers often seek a repre-
