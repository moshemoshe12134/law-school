**Discussion Questions \# 6 (Panel 2)**

1.  The economic value of a tax deduction is the amount of tax it allows
    you to avoid.

    a.  Is the ability to deduct \$1 of expense worth \$1?

    b.  Assume that a corporation's tax rate is 21%. If the corporation
        earns \$1, how much tax must the corporation pay?

    c.  Assume now that the corporation is able to deduct a \$1 expense.
        How much tax does the corporation avoid? What is the economic
        value of this \$1 deduction?

    d.  Please fill in the blank: The economic value of a deduction
        depends on a taxpayer's [.]{.underline}

2.  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the U.S. Congress
    passed the [Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES)
    Act. One of its provisions enabled taxpayers to "carry back" net
    operating losses ("NOLs"). As background, let's cover a few basics
    of how NOLs are taxed in the U.S.]{.mark}

    a.  [Assume that Corporation (a U.S. taxpayer) has \$9 million of
        revenue in 2020 and \$10 million of expenses. Do you expect
        Corporation to pay any tax in 2020?]{.mark}

    b.  [How is its "net operating loss" ("NOL") of \$1 million treated?
        The U.S. corporate tax rate is 21%. Do you expect the NOL to
        generate a \$210,000 tax refund in 2020?]{.mark}

    c.  [Starting in 2018, U.S. corporations with NOLs could only "carry
        forward" tax losses. "Carrybacks" were no longer allowed. What
        is the difference between a carryforward and a
        carryback?]{.mark}

    d.  [In the above example, Corporation generates a \$1 million net
        operating loss in 2020. Assume that Corporation had more than
        \$1 million of net income in 2019, and expects to have more than
        \$1 million of net income in 2021. If only carryforwards are
        allowed, in which year would Corporation deduct its NOL? What if
        carrybacks are allowed?]{.mark}

3.  [In the CARES Act, Congress authorized taxpayers once again to carry
    back losses (as they used to be able to do before 2018), but only
    losses generated in three years: 2018, 2019, and 2020. Assume that
    Businessco had \$5 million of taxable income in 2017, \$5 million of
    taxable income in 2018, and \$2 million of NOLs in 2019. Because of
    the pandemic, Businessco expects to have more losses in
    2020.]{.mark}

    a.  [Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: "The
        CARES Act allows Businessco to get a tax refund for its 2019 NOL
        \-- and thus to access more cash \-- sooner than it otherwise
        would." In light of your answer, what policy do you think
        Congress was pursuing?]{.mark}

    b.  [The U.S. corporate tax rate was 35% in 2017 (and in years
        before then), and this tax rate was reduced to 21% in 2018. What
        was the value of a \$1 tax deduction in 2017? What about in
        2018? In which year would you prefer to take a
        deduction?]{.mark}

    c.  [Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: "Through
        the CARES Act, the U.S. government used the tax system to get
        cash in the hands of corporations by making tax refunds more
        generous."]{.mark}

4.  [Hotelco, a publicly-traded U.S. company, owns a chain of U.S.
    hotels catering to business travelers. In the 1990s, Hotelco
    branched out, opening a number of theme parks and casinos throughout
    the U.S.. In 2017, Hotelco hired a new CEO, Carla, who decided that
    casinos and theme parks are very different from hotels, so they
    should not be operated together. So she put all of Hotelco's theme
    parks and casinos into a subsidiary, and on January 1, 2018, Hotelco
    "spun off" this subsidiary, "Recreationco," to Hotelco's
    shareholders as an independent publicly-traded company.]{.mark}

    a.  [What is a "spin off"?]{.mark}

    b.  [Assume a shareholder owned one share of Hotelco before the
        spin. Would she still have this share after the spin? What else
        would she have?]{.mark}

5.  [Continuing with the facts of the prior problem, assume that Hotelco
    used to be very profitable, but the company had very large losses in
    2018, and less significant losses in 2019 (as it started to make a
    comeback). Although 2020 started out better, the pandemic changed
    that overnight, so Hotelco expects large losses again in 2020.
    Specifically, the results are as follows:]{.mark}

> [2013: \$100 million profit]{.mark}
>
> [2014: \$100 million profit]{.mark}
>
> [2015: \$100 million profit]{.mark}
>
> [2016: \$100 million profit]{.mark}
>
> [2017: \$100 million profit]{.mark}
>
> [2018: \$200 million loss (Hotelco)]{.mark}
>
> [2019 \$50 million loss (Hotelco).]{.mark}

a.  [Under the CARES Act, Hotelco can carry back losses five years
    (e.g., from 2018 to 2013). If it does not have enough income to use
    those losses, it can carry the remainder back four years (from 2018
    to 2014), and then three years (to 2015), and then two years (to
    2016), and then one year (to 2017). Assuming that Hotelco carries
    back its \$200 million loss from 2018 , in what years does it deduct
    it?]{.mark}

b.  [In what years would Hotelco use its \$50 million loss from
    2019?]{.mark}

c.  [The CARES Act allows a company to waive its right to carryback
    losses, and to carry them forward instead. You are Hotelco's tax
    advisor. Should Hotelco carry back its 2018 and 2019 losses to
    earlier years? Why or why not?]{.mark}

d.  [If Hotelco has \$100 million of losses in 2020, could it carry all
    of that back?]{.mark}

e.  [What if Hotelco has \$300 million of losses in 2020. Could it carry
    all of these losses back?]{.mark}

6.  [Continuing with the same facts, business has not been good for
    Recreationco either since the spin. Recreationco lost \$50 million
    in both 2018 and 2019. Recreationco also expects losses in 2020
    because its theme parks and casinos all had to close in mid-March
    because of the pandemic.]{.mark}

    a.  [Do you think Recreationco would want to carry back its 2018 and
        2019 losses back to earlier years? Why or why not?]{.mark}

    b.  [Before January 1, 2018, Recreationco was wholly owned by
        Hotelco. As a result, for the tax years before 2018,
        Recreationco did not file its own tax return. Instead, as part
        of Hotelco, its results were reflected in Hotelco's tax return.
        Compared with Hotelco, is it easier or harder for Recreationco
        to carry back losses?]{.mark}

    c.  [Do you know whether the CARES Act provides Recreationco with a
        way to carry back its losses to the years before the spin
        off?]{.mark}

7.  [In a spinoff, two businesses that have been affiliated \-- and thus
    have filed a single tax return together \-- become independent
    businesses, which each file their own return. To prepare for the
    spinoff, these businesses have to come to an agreement, usually
    called a "tax matters agreement," about how they will handle this
    transition. The following are relevant portions of the tax matters
    agreement for the spinoff of Recreationco.]{.mark}

> *[1.01: Hotelco has the right to amend any Hotelco tax return with
> respect to 2017 or any earlier years.]{.mark}*
>
> *[1.02 Recreationco shall not carry back any U.S.federal income tax
> Item to 2017 or an earlier tax year.]{.mark}*
>
> [*1.03 Any refund of U.S. federal income Tax received from a Taxing
> Authority by Hotelco or Recreationco with respect to a Hotelco return
> shall be the property of the Hotelco, regardless of whether all or any
> portion of such refund is attributable to any credit or deduction of
> Recreationco.*]{.mark}

A.  [What financial benefit would there be for Recreationco to carry
    back its \$100 million of losses (from 2018 and 2019) to 2017 or
    earlier? What is the financial value of this benefit?]{.mark}

B.  [If Recreationco wants to carry back these losses, does the tax
    matters agreement give it the ability to do so? What (if anything)
    can Recreationco do to tap this financial benefit?]{.mark}

C.  [Under the tax matters agreement, which company has more leverage in
    any negotiation?]{.mark}

D.  [Richard, the CEO of Recreationco, asks Carla, the CEO of Holdco, to
    help Recreationco carry back its losses. You are Carla's mentor, and
    she calls to ask you for advice. Should she agree? What should she
    ask for in return?]{.mark}

8.  [Grace is the general counsel of Hotelco. Carla calls Grace and
    says, "We're thinking about partnering with Recreationco to carry
    back their losses. If we do this, I want to be protected from all
    risks. Can you please identify the relevant risks and figure out how
    to protect us?" You are Hotelco's outside counsel, and Grace calls
    you with the following questions:]{.mark}

    a.  [Recreationco has \$100 million of losses from 2018 and 2019. To
        carry back this amount, which company is going to file for this
        refund \-- Recreationco or Hotelco? Assume that Recreationco's
        tax return for 2018 and 2019 has not been audited yet, so it's
        possible that the I.R.S. (the tax authority in the U.S.) will
        challenge parts of it. Does this possibility create a risk for
        Hotelco? If so, what should Hotelco do?]{.mark}

    b.  [Hotelco has \$500 million of income from 2013 through 2017.
        Hotelco has \$250 million of losses in 2018 and 2019. Remember
        that Hotelco is allowed also to carry back losses from 2020, and
        does not know yet how much its losses will be in 2020. Does this
        create a risk for Hotelco in partnering with Recreationco to
        carry back losses? If so, what can Hotelco do about
        this?]{.mark}

    c.  [Grace says the following to you: "The CARES Act was very
        generous, giving us an unexpected tax benefit. Do you think the
        U.S. government might pass more legislation like it?" Does this
        possibility create any risks for Hotelco in partnering with
        Recreationco to carry back losses? If so, what can Hotelco
        do?]{.mark}

    d.  [Recreationco has been losing a lot of money, and business
        continues to be very bad. What risk (if any) does this create
        for Hotelco in partnering with Recreationco to carry back
        losses?]{.mark}
