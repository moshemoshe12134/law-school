# Class 6 Prep Sheet: Spinoffs - Cooperation to Claim Tax Losses

**Course:** Deals
**Topic:** Spinoffs, Tax Attributes, and NOL Carrybacks under the CARES Act
**Date:** Spring Semester 2026

---

## Key Concepts Overview

This class focuses on **Net Operating Losses (NOLs)**, the **CARES Act's temporary carryback provisions**, and how spinoffs create complex cooperation problems around valuable tax attributes.

Key themes include:
- **Value of tax deductions** - depends on the taxpayer's marginal tax rate
- **NOLs** - losses that can offset taxable income in other years
- **Carrybacks vs. carryforwards** - timing of when losses can be used
- **CARES Act** - temporarily restored 5-year carryback for 2018-2020 losses
- **Spinoffs** - creating separate companies from a parent's subsidiaries
- **Tax matters agreements** - allocating tax attributes between spun-off companies
- **Cooperation problems** - when one company needs another's tax history to claim benefits

**The core insight:** Tax law doesn't operate in isolation. Corporate transactions like spinoffs create complex interdependencies around valuable tax attributes. Companies must negotiate who gets the benefit of tax attributes that predate the separation, and cooperation can create value for both parties.

## Question 1: The Economic Value of Tax Deductions

### A. Is a $1 Deduction Worth $1?

**NO - a $1 deduction is worth LESS than $1.**

**Why?** A deduction reduces taxable income, not tax liability directly.

**Example:**
- You earn $100
- Tax rate is 21%
- Without deduction: Tax = $100 × 21% = $21
- With $1 deduction: Taxable income = $99, Tax = $99 × 21% = $20.79
- **Value of $1 deduction = $0.21** (the tax savings)

### B. Tax on $1 of Corporate Income

**Corporation earns $1:**
- Tax rate = 21%
- **Tax owed = $1 × 21% = $0.21**

### C. Value of a $1 Deduction

**Corporation can deduct $1 expense:**
- Without deduction: Tax = $1 × 21% = $0.21
- With deduction: Tax = $0
- **Tax avoided = $0.21**
- **Economic value = $0.21**

**Key insight:** The value of a deduction equals the deduction amount × the taxpayer's marginal tax rate.

### D. Fill in the Blank

**The economic value of a deduction depends on a taxpayer's [MARGINAL TAX RATE].**

**Why:**
- Higher tax rate = more valuable deduction
- Lower tax rate = less valuable deduction
- This is why companies want to use deductions when tax rates are high

---

## Question 2: NOL Basics and the CARES Act

### A. Corporation with $9M Revenue, $10M Expenses

**Net operating loss = $10M - $9M = $1M**

**Will Corporation pay tax in 2020? NO.**

- Corporation has a net loss, not income
- No taxable income = no tax
- This creates a Net Operating Loss (NOL)

### B. Does the $1M NOL Generate a $210,000 Refund?

**NO - not under normal rules (before CARES Act).**

**Why:**
- NOLs can generally only be carried **forward** to offset future income
- They don't generate immediate refunds
- Corporation must wait until it has future taxable income to use the NOL

**The $210,000 calculation:**
- $1,000,000 loss × 21% tax rate = $210,000
- This is the tax savings **if and when** the NOL is used against future income
- Not an immediate refund

### C. Carryforward vs. Carryback

**Carryforward:**
- Loss is applied to FUTURE years' income
- Company must wait to benefit
- Typical rule: Can carry forward for 20 years (or indefinitely under post-2017 law)
- Benefit delayed until company becomes profitable again

**Carryback:**
- Loss is applied to PAST years' income
- Company gets tax REFUND now
- Typical pre-2018 rule: Could carry back 2 years
- Benefit immediate - cash back in hand

**Example:**
- 2020: $1M loss
- Carryforward: Use against 2021, 2022, etc. income (delayed benefit)
- Carryback: Use against 2018, 2019 income (immediate refund)

### D. When Would Corporation Deduct the NOL?

**Scenario:** Corporation has $1M NOL in 2020, had income in 2019, expects income in 2021

**If only carryforwards allowed:**
- Deduct in 2021 (or whenever future income occurs)
- Must wait to benefit

**If carrybacks allowed:**
- Deduct against 2019 income
- Get immediate refund
- Benefit sooner

**Key advantage of carryback:** IMMEDIATE CASH

---

## Question 3: CARES Act Provisions

### A. CARES Act Access to Cash - Sooner?

**AGREE - the statement is correct.**

**Why:**
- Carrybacks allow losses to be applied to prior profitable years
- This generates immediate tax refunds
- Without carryback, businesses would wait years to benefit from NOLs
- During pandemic, immediate cash is critical

**Policy Congress was pursuing: ECONOMIC STIMULUS**

- Get cash to struggling businesses quickly
- Help businesses survive pandemic shutdowns
- Stimulate economy by providing liquidity
- Retroactive relief for 2018, 2019, 2020 losses

### B. Value of $1 Deduction - 2017 vs. 2018

**2017 (35% tax rate):**
- Value = $1 × 35% = **$0.35**

**2018 (21% tax rate):**
- Value = $1 × 21% = **$0.21**

**Which year to prefer? 2017 (higher tax rate)**

**Why:**
- $1 deduction saves $0.35 in 2017 vs. $0.21 in 2018
- Higher tax rate = more valuable deduction
- This creates incentive to carry back losses to pre-2018 years

**The CARES Act creates a HUGE benefit:**
- 2018, 2019, 2020 losses can be carried back 5 years
- This includes 2017 (and earlier) when tax rate was 35%
- Companies get bigger refunds by carrying back to high-tax years

### C. CARES Act Using Tax System for Generosity

**AGREE - this is correct.**

**Why:**

1. **Restored carrybacks:** Previously eliminated, now back for 2018-2020

2. **5-year carryback:** Longer than the old 2-year rule

3. **Higher tax rates in carryback years:** 2017 and earlier had 35% rate vs. 21% now

4. **Immediate refunds:** Critical timing for pandemic relief

**The policy logic:**
- Government used tax code as stimulus tool
- More generous than normal NOL rules
- Businesses get bigger refunds, sooner
- Helps with cash flow during crisis

**Example:**
- $1M loss in 2019
- Carry back to 2017 at 35% = $350,000 refund
- vs. carry forward to 2021 at 21% = $210,000 future savings
- CARES Act provides $140,000 extra benefit + immediate cash

## Question 4: Hotelco and Recreationco - Spinoff Basics

### A. What is a "Spin Off"?

**A spinoff** is a corporate transaction where a company creates a new independent company from one of its subsidiaries and distributes the shares to existing shareholders.

**Key characteristics:**
1. Parent company (Hotelco) separates a business unit into a new entity (Recreationco)
2. Shares of new company are distributed to parent's shareholders
3. Shareholders end up with stock in both companies
4. Tax-free (typically) if structured properly
5. Creates two independent public companies from one

**Why do spinoffs?**
- Unlock value (market may value businesses separately more than together)
- Focus on core business
- Strategic reasons (different businesses need different management)

### B. What Happens to Shareholder's Stock?

**Before spinoff:**
- Shareholder owns 1 share of Hotelco

**After spinoff:**
- Shareholder STILL owns her 1 share of Hotelco (it wasn't taken away)
- PLUS she receives new shares of Recreationco
- **She ends up with stock in BOTH companies**

**Example:**
- Before: 100 shares of Hotelco
- After: 100 shares of Hotelco + 20 shares of Recreationco (ratio depends on deal)

**Tax treatment:**
- Typically tax-free to shareholders
- No immediate tax consequence
- Shareholder's total investment is split between two companies

## Question 5: Hotelco's Losses and Carrybacks

### A. Carrying Back $200M Loss from 2018

**Hotelco's income history:**
- 2013: $100M profit
- 2014: $100M profit
- 2015: $100M profit
- 2016: $100M profit
- 2017: $100M profit
- **2018: $200M loss**

**Applying the $200M carryback:**

**Step 1:** Carry back to 2013 (5 years)
- Offset entire $100M income
- Remaining loss: $200M - $100M = $100M

**Step 2:** Carry back to 2014 (4 years)
- Offset entire $100M income
- Remaining loss: $100M - $100M = $0

**Answer:** Hotelco deducts the loss in **2013 and 2014** (using all $200M).

**Tax benefit:**
- 2013: $100M × 35% = $35M refund
- 2014: $100M × 35% = $35M refund
- **Total: $70M refund**

### B. Carrying Back $50M Loss from 2019

**Applying the $50M carryback:**

**Step 1:** Carry back to 2014 (5 years from 2019)
- But 2014 income already used by 2018 loss
- Can't double-count income
- Go to next available year

**Wait - 2014 income was already used!**

Let me reconsider - we need to track which years still have available income:

- 2013: Used by 2018 loss (fully used)
- 2014: Used by 2018 loss (fully used)
- 2015: Available ($100M income)
- 2016: Available ($100M income)
- 2017: Available ($100M income)

**Answer:** Hotelco deducts the 2019 loss in **2015** (using $50M of the $100M income).

**Tax benefit:**
- 2015: $50M × 35% = $17.5M refund

### C. Should Hotelco Carry Back Losses?

**Analysis:**

| Loss Year | Amount | Tax Rate if Carried Back | Benefit |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------|---------|
| 2018 | $200M | 35% (2013-2014) | $70M refund NOW |
| 2019 | $50M | 35% (2015) | $17.5M refund NOW |
| 2020 | TBD | 35% if carry back, 21% if carry forward | TBD |

**Recommendation: YES, carry back the losses.**

**Why:**

1. **Higher tax rate:** 35% vs. 21% = bigger refund
2. **Time value of money:** Cash now is worth more than cash later
3. **Financial distress:** Hotelco needs liquidity during pandemic
4. **No reason to wait:** Future income uncertain

**Tax advisor's advice:** Carry back all possible losses to maximize immediate refunds.

### D. $100M Loss in 2020 - Can It All Be Carried Back?

**YES - assuming enough past income to absorb it.**

**Available income from past years:**
- 2013: $100M (used by 2018 loss)
- 2014: $100M (used by 2018 loss)
- 2015: $100M (only $50M used by 2019 loss, so $50M available)
- 2016: $100M (available)
- 2017: $100M (available)

**Total available: $250M**

**$100M loss can be fully absorbed:**
- Use remaining $50M from 2015
- Use $50M from 2016

**Answer: YES, all $100M can be carried back.**

### E. $300M Loss in 2020 - Can It All Be Carried Back?

**Available income:**
- 2015: $50M remaining
- 2016: $100M
- 2017: $100M
- **Total available: $250M**

**$300M loss:**
- Can carry back $250M to 2015, 2016, 2017
- **Remaining $50M must be carried forward** to future years

**Answer: NO, only $250M can be carried back. The remaining $50M must be carried forward.**

## Question 6: Recreationco's NOL Problem

### A. Should Recreationco Carry Back Losses?

**Recreationco's situation:**
- Lost $50M in 2018
- Lost $50M in 2019
- Expects losses in 2020
- **Crucially:** Didn't exist before 2018 (was part of Hotelco)

**Should Recreationco want to carry back? YES - but there's a problem.**

**Why Recreationco would want to:**
- Same reasons as Hotelco (higher tax rate, immediate cash)
- $100M total losses × 35% = $35M potential refund

**The PROBLEM:**
- Recreationco didn't exist before 2018
- It has no tax history before the spinoff
- It has no past income to offset losses against
- **Recreationco cannot carry back losses on its own**

### B. Easier or Harder for Recreationco?

**MUCH HARDER than Hotelco.**

**Hotelco:**
- Has long tax history with profitable years
- Can easily carry back losses to those years
- Straightforward process

**Recreationco:**
- No tax history before 2018
- Before spinoff, its results were part of Hotelco's tax returns
- Cannot file amended returns for years it didn't exist
- **Cannot carry back losses on its own**

**This creates a major disadvantage for spun-off companies with losses.**

### C. Does CARES Act Provide a Way?

**YES - but it requires cooperation with Hotelco.**

**The solution:**
- Recreationco can carry losses back to the years before spinoff
- But it must do so through Hotelco's tax returns
- Recreationco needs Hotelco to amend its pre-2018 returns
- This requires RECREATIONCO AND HOTELCO TO WORK TOGETHER

**Why:**
- Before 2018, Recreationco was part of Hotelco
- Hotelco filed consolidated tax returns that included Recreationco's results
- To carry back losses, Hotelco must amend those returns
- The refund would come to Hotelco (the taxpayer)
- Recreationco needs an agreement to get the benefit

**Key insight:** Spinoffs create interdependence. The spun-off company needs the parent's cooperation to access pre-spinoff tax benefits.

---

## Question 7: Tax Matters Agreement

### A. Financial Benefit for Recreationco

**Recreationco's losses:**
- 2018: $50M loss
- 2019: $50M loss
- **Total: $100M**

**Financial benefit:**
- Carry back to 2013-2017 (Hotelco's profitable years)
- Tax rate in those years: 35%
- **Value: $100M × 35% = $35M refund**

**Why valuable:**
- Immediate cash during crisis
- Higher tax rate means bigger benefit
- Recreationco desperately needs liquidity

### B. Can Recreationco Carry Back Under the Agreement?

**NO - the tax matters agreement prohibits it.**

**Relevant provisions:**

> **1.02:** "Recreationco shall not carry back any U.S. federal income tax Item to 2017 or an earlier tax year."

This is an EXPLICIT prohibition.

> **1.03:** "Any refund of U.S. federal income Tax received from a Taxing Authority by Hotelco or Recreationco with respect to a Hotelco return shall be the property of the Hotelco, regardless of whether all or any portion of such refund is attributable to any credit or deduction of Recreationco."

This means even if Hotelco gets a refund attributable to Recreationco's losses, Recreationco doesn't get the money.

**What can Recreationco do?**

**Option 1: Renegotiate the tax matters agreement**
- Ask Hotelco to modify the agreement
- Need Hotelco's consent

**Option 2: Ask Hotelco to amend its returns voluntarily**
- Hotelco has right to amend under 1.01
- Hotelco gets the refund under 1.03
- Then Hotelco can share the refund with Recreationco
- This requires a SEPARATE agreement (side letter)

**Option 3: Waive and carry forward**
- Recreationco gives up on carryback
- Uses losses for future years (at 21% rate)
- Less valuable but still provides some benefit

**Key point:** Recreationco cannot act alone. It needs Hotelco's cooperation.

### C. Which Company Has More Leverage?

**HOTELCO has more leverage.**

**Why:**

1. **Hotelco controls the amendable returns:**
   - Provision 1.01 gives Hotelco exclusive right to amend pre-2018 returns
   - Recreationco cannot amend those returns itself

2. **Hotelco keeps the refunds:**
   - Provision 1.03 says refunds go to Hotelco
   - Even if attributable to Recreationco's deductions

3. **Recreationco is prohibited from carryback:**
   - Provision 1.02 explicitly prohibits Recreationco from carrying back
   - Recreationco needs Hotelco to change this

4. **Hotelco has its own losses:**
   - Hotelco has $250M in losses (2018-2019)
   - Hotelco may want to preserve its own capacity to carry back
   - Limitation on how much past income can be used

**But Recreationco has some leverage:**

1. **Recreationco can threaten to withhold cooperation on other matters**
2. **Recreationco might have claims if the tax matters agreement is unfair**
3. **Both companies benefit from a deal - this is a cooperative opportunity**

### D. Should Carla Agree? What Should She Ask For?

**Carla's perspective as Hotelco CEO:**

**Why she might agree:**
1. **Goodwill:** Helps Recreationco (which Hotelco spun off)
2. **Business relationship:** Both companies may need to work together
3. **Fairness:** Recreationco's losses contributed to Hotelco's pre-spinoff success
4. **Reputation:** Being reasonable creates goodwill

**Risks and concerns:**
1. **Hotelco's own losses:** Hotelco has $250M to carry back
2. **Limited past income:** Only $500M total income from 2013-2017
3. **IRS scrutiny:** Amending returns creates audit risk
4. **Unsure future:** 2020 losses unknown (could be significant)
5. **Legislative risk:** Congress might change rules again

**What Carla should ask for in return:**

**1. Financial consideration:**
   - **Ask for percentage of the refund** (e.g., 20-30%)
   - Recreationco gets $35M, gives Hotelco $7-10M as "fee"
   - Compensation for using Hotelco's tax attributes and taking on risk

**2. Protection and indemnity:**
   - **Recreationco indemnifies Hotelco for any IRS challenges**
   - If IRS disallows the losses, Recreationco bears the cost
   - Hotelco should be made whole

**3. Priority for Hotelco's own losses:**
   - **Hotelco's 2018-2019-2020 losses get priority**
   - Recreationco only uses any remaining capacity
   - Protects Hotelco's ability to benefit from CARES Act

**4. Risk allocation:**
   - **Recreationco bears all audit risk**
   - **Recreationco pays all legal and accounting fees**
   - **Hotelco is held harmless**

**5. Legislative protection:**
   - **If Congress changes law to reduce benefit, Recreationco bears that risk**
   - Or renegotiation clause if rules change

**Example deal structure:**
- Hotelco agrees to carry back $100M of Recreationco's losses
- This generates $35M refund
- Recreationco gets $25-30M
- Hotelco keeps $5-10M as fee/risk premium
- Recreationco indemnifies Hotelco for all risks
- Hotelco's own losses get priority

**Key insight:** This is a classic cooperation problem. Both parties can benefit, but they need to allocate risks and rewards fairly.

---

## Question 8: Risks and Protections for Hotelco

### A. Which Company Files? Audit Risk?

**Who files: HOTELCO files the amended return.**

**Why:**
- Only Hotelco can amend pre-2018 returns (provision 1.01)
- Those were Hotelco's tax returns
- Recreationco didn't exist as a separate taxpayer

**Does this create risk? YES - significant audit risk.**

**The risk:**
1. **IRS examination of amended return:**
   - Amending a return draws IRS attention
   - IRS may examine entire return, not just the NOL carryback
   - Could challenge other items on the return

2. **Recreationco's loss calculations:**
   - IRS might challenge Recreationco's 2018-2019 losses
   - Were expenses properly documented?
   - Were allocations between Hotelco and Recreationco reasonable?
   - This could affect the entire tax picture

3. **Statute of limitations:**
   - Pre-2018 returns were "closed" (audit period expired)
   - Amending reopens them
   - Hotelco loses the protection of the statute of limitations

4. **Interest and penalties:**
   - If IRS disallows part of the carryback
   - Hotelco might owe interest and penalties
   - Could be significant

**What Hotelco should do:**

**1. Indemnification from Recreationco:**
   - Recreationco agrees to reimburse Hotelco for any additional tax, interest, penalties
   - Recreationco pays all legal and accounting costs
   - Hotelco is held harmless

**2. Careful due diligence:**
   - Review Recreationco's tax returns for 2018-2019
   - Verify losses are properly calculated
   - Ensure adequate documentation

**3. Escrow or holdback:**
   - Recreationco doesn't get full refund immediately
   - Portion held back to cover potential IRS adjustments
   - Released after audit period passes

**4. Limitation on liability:**
   - Cap Recreationco's indemnity obligation at some amount
   - But Recreationco must have sufficient assets to satisfy it

**5. Insurance:**
   - Tax indemnity insurance (if available)
   - Protects both parties

### B. Hotelco's Own 2020 Losses - Risk?

**Hotelco's situation:**
- $500M income from 2013-2017
- $250M losses from 2018-2019
- **Unknown losses in 2020**

**The risk:**

**Capacity constraint:**
- Only $500M of past income available to absorb carrybacks
- Hotelco's own 2018-2019 losses = $250M
- Recreationco wants to carry back $100M
- **Total used: $350M**
- **Remaining capacity: $150M**

**If 2020 losses exceed $150M:**
- Hotelco needs to preserve capacity for its own losses
- Recreationco's carryback might displace Hotelco's 2020 carryback
- This could cost Hotelco significant money

**Example scenario:**
- 2020 losses = $300M
- Only $150M capacity remaining
- $150M of Hotelco's 2020 losses must be carried forward at 21% rate
- **Cost to Hotelco:** $150M × (35% - 21%) = $21M lost tax benefit

**What Hotelco should do:**

**1. Subordination/Reservation:**
   - Recreationco's carryback is subordinate to Hotelco's own losses
   - If 2020 losses exceed capacity, Recreationco's claim is reduced
   - Hotelco's 2020 losses get priority

**2. Reopener clause:**
   - If 2020 losses exceed threshold, deal can be renegotiated
   - Or Recreationco's carryback is reduced proportionally

**3. Cap on Recreationco's use:**
   - Limit Recreationco to $X amount
   - Preserve capacity for Hotelco's 2020 losses

**4. Estimate 2020 losses first:**
   - Wait until year-end to assess 2020
   - Then determine how much capacity to offer Recreationco

**5. Formula-based allocation:**
   - If capacity insufficient, allocate proportionally
   - Hotelco gets 71% ($250M/$350M), Recreationco gets 29% ($100M/$350M)
   - Or some other agreed formula

### C. Risk of More Legislation Like CARES Act

**Grace's concern:** "Do you think the U.S. government might pass more legislation like it?"

**The risk:**

**Scenario:** Congress passes another law providing additional tax relief

**Example:**
- Congress says "Corporations can carry back losses to 2012 or earlier"
- Or "Tax rates for carryback are increased to 40%"
- Or "NOLs are no longer limited to 80% of income"

**How this creates risk:**
1. **Hotelco might want to amend returns again**
2. **But Recreationco already used capacity**
3. **Hotelco's ability to benefit from new law is reduced**
4. **Recreationco got benefit; Hotelco might miss out on future benefits**

**Or worse:**
- New law is less generous
- IRS scrutinizes CARES Act carrybacks
- Hotelco exposed to audit because of Recreationco's carryback

**What Hotelco should do:**

**1. Legislative change clause:**
   - If new law provides additional benefits, they're shared
   - Or Hotelco has right to revisit the deal
   - Allocation can be adjusted

**2. Most favored nation clause:**
   - If government provides more generous terms later
   - Recreationco and Hotelco both benefit
   - Or Hotelco gets right to reclaim some of Recreationco's benefit

**3. Clawback provision:**
   - If law changes to make carrybacks less attractive
   - Hotelco can claw back some of Recreationco's refund
   - Protects Hotelco from adverse legislation

**4. Legislative monitoring:**
   - Agree to monitor tax legislation
   - Renegotiate if significant changes occur

**5. Cap and adjust:**
   - Put a cap on Recreationco's total benefit
   - If law changes, amounts can be adjusted within the cap

### D. Recreationco's Continuing Bad Business - Risk?

**Recreationco's situation:**
- Losing lots of money
- Business continues to be very bad
- Pandemic hit theme parks and casinos hard

**The risk for Hotelco:**

**1. Credit risk:**
   - Recreationco might go bankrupt
   - If Recreationco indemnified Hotelco, the indemnity is worthless
   - Hotelco could be left holding the bag for IRS challenges

**2. Future capacity needs:**
   - Recreationco might have more losses in 2020, 2021, etc.
   - Might want to carry those back too
   - Could further reduce capacity for Hotelco

**3. Ongoing audit risk:**
   - If Recreationco's business is troubled
   - More likely to have aggressive tax positions
   - Higher risk of IRS challenges

**4. Reputational risk:**
   - If Recreationco fails
   - Hotelco spun it off recently
   - Might reflect poorly on Hotelco's judgment

**What Hotelco should do:**

**1. Financial strength test:**
   - Require Recreationco to maintain minimum net worth
   - If drops below threshold, deal terminates
   - Protects Hotelco's indemnity

**2. Security/collateral:**
   - Recreationco provides letter of credit or guarantee
   - Secures Hotelco against Recreationco's insolvency
   - Especially important for indemnity obligations

**3. Limit future carrybacks:**
   - Deal only covers 2018-2019 losses
   - 2020 and beyond are not included
   - Requires separate negotiation

**4. Right to terminate:**
   - If Recreationco's financial condition deteriorates
   - Hotelco can terminate the agreement
   - Or amend returns to remove Recreationco's losses

**5. Insurance:**
   - Recreationco obtains business interruption insurance
   - Or tax liability insurance
   - Protects both parties

**6. Monitoring rights:**
   - Hotelco gets access to Recreationco's financial information
   - Can assess ongoing creditworthiness
   - Early warning of problems

**Key insight:** Partnering with a financially troubled company creates significant risks. The agreement must protect Hotelco from Recreationco's potential insolvency and continuing business problems.

## Key Takeaways

### Tax Basics

**1. Value of deductions:**
- Worth: Deduction × Marginal tax rate
- Higher tax rate = more valuable deduction
- This is why carrybacks to pre-2018 years are so valuable (35% vs. 21%)

**2. Net Operating Losses:**
- Created when expenses exceed income
- Can be carried forward to offset future income
- Or (under CARES Act) carried back to get immediate refunds
- Critical tool for businesses with volatile income

### CARES Act NOL Provisions

**Temporary, retroactive relief for 2018-2020:**
1. **5-year carryback** (vs. 0 years under 2017 law)
2. **No 80% limitation** for carryback period
3. **Indefinite carryforward** for remaining losses
4. **Applies to losses from 2018, 2019, 2020 only**

**Policy rationale:**
- Get immediate cash to businesses
- Use higher tax rates from past years
- Provide economic stimulus during pandemic

### Spinoffs and Tax Attributes

**The core problem:**
- Spinoffs create separate companies
- Tax history belongs to parent, not subsidiary
- Subsidiary with losses cannot carry back on its own
- Requires cooperation with parent

**Tax matters agreements:**
- Allocate tax attributes between companies
- Govern who can amend pre-spinoff returns
- Determine who gets refunds
- Create both rights and restrictions

### Cooperation Problems

**Recreationco needs Hotelco:**
- Cannot carry back losses alone
- Needs Hotelco to amend returns
- Refund goes to Hotelco under tax matters agreement
- Must negotiate to access benefit

**Hotelco has leverage:**
- Controls amendable returns
- Keeps refunds under agreement
- Has its own losses to carry back
- Bears all audit and legislative risks

**But both can benefit:**
- $35M potential value for Recreationco
- Hotelco can demand fee/risk premium
- Cooperation creates $35M of value that wouldn't exist otherwise

### Risk Allocation

**Major risks for Hotelco:**
1. **Audit risk:** Amending returns opens IRS scrutiny
2. **Capacity constraint:** Limited past income to absorb carrybacks
3. **Legislative risk:** Future law changes could help or hurt
4. **Credit risk:** Recreationco might become insolvent
5. **Priority disputes:** Which losses get priority for limited capacity?

**Risk mitigation tools:**
1. **Indemnification:** Recreationco reimburses Hotelco for all tax-related costs
2. **Subordination:** Hotelco's losses get priority over Recreationco's
3. **Caps and limits:** Limit Recreationco's use of tax attributes
4. **Security:** Letter of credit or collateral
5. **Termination rights:** Can exit deal if circumstances change
6. **Legislative adjustment:** Revisit deal if law changes

### Economic Insights

**1. Interdependence in transactions:**
- Corporate transactions create ongoing relationships
- Spinoffs don't fully separate companies
- Tax, accounting, and operational ties remain
- Cooperation can create value for both parties

**2. Risk allocation matters:**
- Every provision allocates risk between parties
- More risk = more compensation required
- Careful drafting protects both parties

**3. Information and incentives:**
- Recreationco has more information about its losses
- Hotelco bears the tax risk
- Alignment requires careful agreement design

**4. Value creation through cooperation:**
- Without cooperation: $0 value for Recreationco's losses
- With cooperation: $35M value created
- Both parties can share in this created value
- This is the essence of transactional lawyering

## Notes for Class Discussion

- **Tax affects everything:** Even "simple" spinoffs have complex tax implications
- **CARES Act context:** This was pandemic relief - understanding the policy helps understand the law
- **Both sides can win:** Cooperation problems aren't zero-sum - creative solutions create value
- **Risk allocation is key:** Every partnership requires thinking about what could go wrong
- **Tax matters agreements are critical:** They govern ongoing relationships after spinoffs
- **Numbers matter:** $35M at stake - these are real economic benefits
- **NOL carrybacks are complex:** Multiple years, tax rates, limitations all interact
