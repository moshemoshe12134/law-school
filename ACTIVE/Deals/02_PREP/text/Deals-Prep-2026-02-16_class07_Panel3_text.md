# Class 7 Prep Sheet: Venture Capital - Staged Financing and Incentive Compensation

**Course:** Deals
**Topic:** Venture Capital: Staged Financing and Incentive Compensation
**Date:** Spring Semester 2026

---

## Key Concepts Overview

This class focuses on **venture capital financing** and the unique contractual structures used to address extreme forms of uncertainty, information asymmetry, and agency costs in early-stage, high-technology companies.

Key themes include:
- **Staged financing** - funding tied to milestones, giving investors an option to abandon
- **VC control rights** - disproportionate control relative to equity ownership
- **Entrepreneur compensation** - stock-heavy, creating high-powered incentives
- **Information signaling** - entrepreneurs reveal quality through accepting intense incentives
- **Reputation markets** - constraining VC opportunism through future fundraising needs
- **Exit strategies** - IPOs and sales as mechanisms for recycling capital and returning control
- **Limited partnership structure** - how VCs are funded by institutional investors

**The core insight:** Venture capital contracts create a system of intense incentives coupled with intense monitoring. The structure transfers discretion from entrepreneurs to VCs, then constrains VC opportunism through reputation markets and the need to raise future funds.

## Question 1: Ellen's Investor Choice - Schoolco vs. Pensionco

### A. Investor Expertise and Value-Add

**Which investor has potentially greater expertise? SCHOOLCO**

**Why:**
- Schoolco is in the education business
- Understands the market for online courses
- Has relationships with faculty and universities
- Knows regulatory issues in education
- Has credibility with potential customers

**Ways investors can add value beyond money:**

1. **Strategic guidance:**
   - Help refine business model
   - Advise on pricing and marketing
   - Identify potential partners

2. **Human capital:**
   - Help recruit talent
   - Provide management expertise
   - Serve on board of directors

3. **Credibility:**
   - Vouch for the business to customers, suppliers, employees
   - Reputational intermediary effect
   - Open doors that would otherwise be closed

4. **Network effects:**
   - Introduce to other investors
   - Connect to potential partners
   - Provide access to industry contacts

5. **Operational assistance:**
   - Help with strategy and execution
   - Provide monitoring and accountability
   - Assist with problem-solving

### B. Should You Care Who Other Investors Are?

**YES - it matters a lot.**

**Would you be more likely to invest if Schoolco is the other investor?**

**YES - for several reasons:**

1. **Due diligence shortcut:**
   - If Schoolco (an expert in education) invested, they probably did extensive research
   - They have better information than you do
   - Their decision provides valuable information about the business's prospects

2. **Validation and signaling:**
   - Schoolco's investment signals the business has merit
   - Reduces information asymmetry
   - Other qualified investors vetted the deal

3. **Future funding assurance:**
   - Schoolco can provide more capital if needed
   - Less worried about running out of money
   - Deeper pockets than individual investors

4. **Value-add capabilities:**
   - Schoolco will actively help the business
   - Increases chances of success
   - Benefits all shareholders

5. **Reduced agency costs:**
   - Sophisticated investor will monitor
   - Less need for you to monitor
   - Free-rider on Schoolco's oversight

**What about Pensionco?**

**Less attractive:**
- No expertise in education
- Purely financial investor
- Won't add strategic value
- But still provides validation that someone invested

**Key insight:** Investment decisions are interdependent. Who else invests provides valuable information and affects the investment's value.

### C. Ellen's CEO Concern - Agency Cost

**What is this conflict called? AGENCY COST**

**Definition:** Agency costs arise when one party (the agent) makes decisions on behalf of another party (the principal), but their interests are not aligned. The agent may act in ways that benefit themselves at the principal's expense.

**In this case:**
- Ellen (agent/CEO) makes decisions for shareholders (principals/investors)
- Ellen wants to keep her job as CEO
- Investors might want to replace her if performance is poor
- Ellen's interest (job security) may conflict with investors' interest (maximizing value)

**Does Ellen have reason to prefer one employer over the other? YES - Schoolco.**

**Why Ellen might prefer Schoolco:**

1. **Less monitoring sophistication:**
   - Schoolco may be less experienced as a VC investor
   - May not monitor as closely as professional investors
   - Might be more "hands-off" in oversight

2. **Different priorities:**
   - Schoolco might value strategic relationship more than financial return
   - Pensionco is purely focused on financial return
   - Schoolco might be more tolerant of underperformance if strategic benefits exist

3. **Relationship dynamics:**
   - Schoolco might view Ellen as a partner in education
   - Pensionco views Ellen purely as a service provider
   - More personal connection with Schoolco

4. **Replacement difficulty:**
   - Schoolco might find it harder to identify and recruit replacement CEOs
   - Pensionco might have relationships with many executives
   - Specialized knowledge makes Ellen harder to replace in education context

5. **Cultural fit:**
   - Schoolco shares Ellen's passion for education
   - Pensionco is a financial institution
   - Alignment of values and mission

**But there's a counterargument:**

**Pensionco might be easier to work with:**
- Purely financial - clear expectations
- No conflicting strategic interests
- Professional investment approach
- Less likely to interfere in operations

**Key insight:** Different investors have different monitoring styles, strategic interests, and tolerance for management. Affects agency costs and employment security.

## Question 2: Competing Investment Offers

### The Offers Compared

**Pensionco's offer:**
- $400,000 for 500,000 shares (half the company)
- $200,000 on January 1
- $200,000 on July 1
- **OBLIGATED to pay the second $200,000**

**Schoolco's offer:**
- $250,000 on January 1 for 250,000 shares (¼ of company)
- **OPTION** to buy another 250,000 shares (¼ of company) on June 30 for $250,000
- **NOT OBLIGATED** to exercise the option

### A. Do Both Offers Ensure Ellen Has the Money She Needs?

**Pensionco: YES**
- Obligated to pay both installments
- Ellen knows she'll have the money

**Schoolco: MAYBE**
- Gets $250,000 for sure on January 1
- The July 1 funding is OPTIONAL for Schoolco
- If Schoolco doesn't exercise the option, Ellen has no money for faculty
- **Significant risk of insufficient funding**

### B. Why Ellen Might Be Tempted by Schoolco's Offer

**The temptation:**

1. **More money upfront ($250,000 vs. $200,000):**
   - Extra $50,000 on January 1
   - Greater financial cushion
   - More runway for technology development

2. **Less dilution initially:**
   - Gives up only 25% of company vs. 50%
   - Retains more ownership
   - More control

3. **Upside potential:**
   - If things go well, she only gave up 25% instead of 50%
   - Keeps more of the value she creates

**Why Ellen might be worried:**

1. **Funding risk:**
   - Schoolco might not exercise the option
   - Business could run out of money
   - Could be forced to accept unfavorable terms later

2. **Uncertainty:**
   - Doesn't know if she'll get the second tranche
   - Hard to plan faculty hiring
   - Could be stranded mid-development

3. **Dependence on Schoolco's assessment:**
   - Schoolco decides based on performance
   - If they're disappointed, no more money
   - Ellen loses control of her destiny

4. **Negotiating leverage:**
   - If Schoolco declines, desperate for money
   - Other investors will know this
   - Might get terrible terms

### C. Why Is Schoolco Paying More? What Are They Getting?

**Why Schoolco is willing to pay more:**

1. **Option value:**
   - The right (but not obligation) to invest more is valuable
   - Like a financial call option
   - If things go well, they can invest more; if not, they walk away
   - This option is worth paying for

2. **Information production:**
   - Gets 6 months to learn more before committing more money
   - Can assess technology progress
   - Can evaluate Ellen's capabilities
   - Reduces uncertainty and information asymmetry

3. **Incentive alignment:**
   - Ellen knows she must perform to get second tranche
   - Creates powerful performance incentive
   - Reduces agency costs
   - Ellen works harder knowing funding depends on success

4. **Risk allocation:**
   - Shifts risk from Schoolco to Ellen
   - If project fails, Schoolco only loses $250,000
   - Ellen bears the risk of business failure between January and June

**What Schoolco is getting in return:**

1. **Option to abandon:**
   - Can walk away after learning more
   - Doesn't have to commit all capital upfront
   - Reduces exposure to uncertainty

2. **Milestone-based funding:**
   - Can assess progress before investing more
   - Ensures money is spent on achieving specific goals
   - Creates discipline for Ellen

3. **Information at decision time:**
   - Sees how well website development goes
   - Evaluates Ellen's management skills
   - Assesses market reception
   - Makes more informed decision

4. **Price control:**
   - If Ellen performs but looks desperate for second funding
   - Schoolco has significant negotiating leverage
   - Could demand even more equity

**Why Schoolco values the extra business term:**

The **option to abandon** is incredibly valuable in venture capital:
- Early-stage businesses have extreme uncertainty
- Most investments fail
- Ability to cut losses after learning more is crucial
- Worth paying premium upfront for this flexibility

### D. Does Changing the Decision Date Matter?

**Ellen's counteroffer:** Move decision from June 30 (after 6 months) to January 6 (after 6 days)

**Is this significant? VERY - it defeats the purpose of staged financing.**

**From Schoolco's perspective:**

1. **No time to assess progress:**
   - 6 days tells nothing about website quality
   - Can't evaluate Ellen's capabilities
   - No meaningful information gained

2. **Option value destroyed:**
   - The whole point is learning before committing more
   - 6 days = no learning
   - Effectively becomes obligated investment

3. **Incentive effect lost:**
   - Ellen doesn't have to perform for 6 months to get second tranche
   - Performance incentive eliminated
   - Agency costs return

4. **Risk shifted back to Schoolco:**
   - No opportunity to assess and potentially walk away
   - Bearing same risk as Pensionco's structure
   - But paying more for the privilege

**Schoolco should refuse this change.**

**The "6-month" period is carefully chosen:**
- Enough time to develop website prototype
- Enough time to assess technical feasibility
- Enough time to evaluate Ellen's performance
- Enough time to learn about market

### E. If Ellen Rejects Schoolco's Offer, What Does It Signal?

**If Ellen is unwilling to accept Schoolco's offer, it signals:**

**Ellen lacks confidence in the business or her own abilities.**

**Why:**

1. **Confident entrepreneurs accept milestone-based funding:**
   - If Ellen believes the website will be great
   - If Ellen believes she can execute
   - If Ellen believes the business model works
   - She should be confident Schoolco will invest more

2. **Refusing suggests fear of failure:**
   - Ellen worries the technology won't work
   - Ellen worries she won't meet milestones
   - Ellen wants to lock in funding in case things go poorly

3. **Staged financing as a screening mechanism:**
   - Good entrepreneurs are willing to be judged on performance
   - Bad entrepreneurs want guaranteed funding
   - The structure separates high-quality from low-quality entrepreneurs

**This is a SIGNALING mechanism:**
- Ellen's willingness to accept intense performance incentives reveals information about her own assessment of her abilities
- Refusing to accept option-based financing is a negative signal
- Tells Schoolco that Ellen is uncertain about the business

**Key insight:** Contract terms are not just about allocating risk; they're about revealing information. Entrepreneurs reveal their confidence through their willingness to accept milestone-based funding.

## Question 3: Pensionco's Decision After Schoolco Declines

**Situation:** Schoolco decided not to buy the additional shares. Ellen goes back to Pensionco.

**Should it matter to Pensionco that Schoolco declined? YES - it's very important information.**

**Why Pensionco should care:**

1. **Information about business quality:**
   - Schoolco had 6 months to observe the business
   - Schoolco had access to internal information
   - Schoolco has expertise in education
   - If they won't invest more, something is probably wrong

2. **Negative signal:**
   - Schoolco walked away despite sunk costs
   - Despite having invested time and money
   - Despite having better information than anyone else
   - This is a powerful adverse signal

3. **Adverse selection problem:**
   - Pensionco knows: "Schoolco knows something I don't"
   - Pensionco is at an informational disadvantage
   - Pensionco should be very cautious

4. **Reputational consequences:**
   - If Pensionco invests after Schoolco declined
   - Looks like Pensionco is desperate or unsophisticated
   - Other VCs will notice
   - Damages reputation

5. **Price implications:**
   - If Pensionco invests anyway
   - Should demand much better terms (more equity for less money)
   - Higher risk premium

**Comparison to other contexts:**
- Like bidding on a house that another buyer walked away from after inspection
- The other buyer saw something they didn't like
- You should be wary

**Key insight:** Investment decisions reveal valuable information. Sophisticated investors learn from each other's decisions.

## Question 4: Right of First Refusal

**What is a "right of first refusal"?**

A **right of first refusal** gives a party the opportunity to match any offer the seller receives from a third party before the seller can accept that offer.

**Example:**
- Company wants to raise more money
- New investor offers to invest $500,000 for 20% of the company
- Existing investor with right of first refusal can match this offer
- New investor can only invest if existing investor declines

**Why is it costly to grant?**

1. **Limits marketability:**
   - Other investors know they might be displaced
   - Reduces willingness to spend time investigating
   - Creates "winner's curse" problem

2. **Reduces competition:**
   - Other investors know existing investor can take their deal
   - If they negotiate good terms, existing investor will take it
   - If they negotiate bad terms, they're stuck with it
   - Only gets to invest if existing investor doesn't want it

3. **Information leakage:**
   - Existing investor learns what terms others are offering
   - Gets market information for free
   - Can use this information strategically

4. **Monopsony power:**
   - Existing investor knows entrepreneur has difficulty finding alternative funding
   - Exploits this bargaining power
   - Can demand unfairly low prices in later rounds

5. **Administrative burden:**
   - Must notify existing investor of any potential investment
   - Delays in funding while waiting for response
   - Transaction costs

**Why would anyone offer one?**

1. **Gets better terms initially:**
   - Investors value the protection
   - Will pay more upfront or accept lower equity
   - Trade-off between current pricing and future flexibility

2. **Aligns incentives:**
   - Existing investor has incentive to continue supporting the company
   - Reduces conflict with new investors
   - Creates orderly process for future funding

3. **Relationship preservation:**
   - Shows loyalty to early investors
   - Maintains good relationship
   - Existing investor feels protected

4. **May be necessary:**
   - Some investors won't invest without it
   - Market standard in venture capital
   - May be required to get any funding at all

## Question 5: Agreement or Disagreement with Statements

### A. "As long as the underlying business makes sense, it doesn't matter who owns it or how the ownership is divided."

**DISAGREE.**

**Why ownership structure matters:**

1. **Incentives:**
   - Different ownership structures create different incentives
   - Entrepreneurs with more equity work harder
   - VCs with control rights monitor more effectively

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Active investors provide oversight
   - Reduce agency costs
   - Add value beyond capital

3. **Access to capital:**
   - Some investors can provide follow-on funding
   - Others cannot
   - Affects ability to grow

4. **Strategic value:**
   - Some investors bring expertise
   - Some bring relationships
   - Some bring credibility

5. **Control rights:**
   - Who can fire the CEO?
   - Who makes major decisions?
   - Affects decision-making quality

6. **Exit strategy:**
   - Different investors have different time horizons
   - Different exit preferences (IPO vs. sale)
   - Affects ultimate outcome

**Example:** A business funded by sophisticated VCs has very different prospects than one funded by naive angel investors.

### B. "In structuring a new deal, we should use the structure from a past deal as a model."

**DISAGREE - or at least, it depends.**

**When precedent is helpful:**
- Market-standard terms (efficient solutions to common problems)
- Proven to work in practice
- Reduces transaction costs
- Predictable for all parties

**When precedent is NOT appropriate:**
- Every business is different
- Different stages require different structures
- Different entrepreneurs need different incentives
- Market conditions change

**Example:**
- Early-stage startup: Needs staged financing, intense monitoring
- Mature business: Might need different structure
- Using "one size fits all" approach is inefficient

**Better approach:**
- Understand the PURPOSE of each provision
- Adapt to specific circumstances
- Use precedent as starting point, not ending point

### C. "We need to structure a deal to reflect what each party brings to the table."

**AGREE.**

**Why:**

1. **Economic efficiency:**
   - Allocate risk to party best able to bear it
   - Allocate control to party with best information/ability
   - Create incentives for value-maximizing behavior

2. **Fairness:**
   - Party who contributes more should receive more
   - Reflects relative bargaining power
   - Parties are more likely to agree

3. **Examples:**
   - Entrepreneur with great idea but no money → gets equity for idea
   - VC with capital and expertise → gets equity and control rights for capital
   - Strategic investor → gets equity plus possible commercial relationship

4. **Customization:**
   - Different contributions require different structures
   - No "one size fits all"

**This is the fundamental principle of deal structuring.**

### D. "Current structuring can affect future bargaining."

**AGREE.**

**Examples:**

1. **Staged financing:**
   - Current structure gives VC option to abandon
   - Affects entrepreneur's bargaining power in future rounds
   - Creates dependence on VC's continued funding

2. **Control rights:**
   - Current VC control affects future ability to raise capital
   - Other investors know who makes decisions
   - Can help or hinder future deals

3. **Rights of first refusal:**
   - Current investor gets protection
   - Affects entrepreneur's ability to work with other investors later
   - Reduces future bargaining options

4. **Vesting terms:**
   - Current structure affects future equity ownership
   - Affects incentives and options

5. **Exit provisions:**
   - Current deal structure affects IPO or sale process
   - Can create or remove flexibility

**Key insight:** Current deal terms create path dependence. Future options are constrained or expanded by today's choices.

### E. "When we structure a deal, we need to focus on the information each party has (or does not have)."

**AGREE - this is critical.**

**Why information matters:**

1. **Information asymmetry is a central problem:**
   - Entrepreneur knows more about the business
   - Investor has less information
   - Must structure deal to address this gap

2. **Signaling mechanisms:**
   - Willingness to accept intense incentives reveals information
   - Staged financing signals entrepreneur confidence
   - Terms reveal what parties know

3. **Due diligence:**
   - Process of reducing information asymmetry
   - Structure determines what information is produced
   - Who bears the cost of information production?

4. **Monitoring rights:**
   - Give investor access to information
   - Board seats, inspection rights, reporting requirements
   - Address ongoing information asymmetry

5. **Milestone-based funding:**
   - Allows investor to learn before committing more
   - Reduces uncertainty over time
   - Addresses dynamic information problems

**Examples:**
- **Uncertainty** → staged financing to learn before committing more
- **Asymmetric information** → investor control rights to monitor
- **Agency costs** → equity compensation to align incentives

**This is the core of venture capital contracting.**

## Question 6: What Is Venture Capital?

**Venture capital** is a form of private equity financing provided by investors (venture capitalists) to startup companies and small businesses with perceived long-term growth potential.

**Key characteristics:**

1. **High-risk, high-return:**
   - Most investments fail
   - But successes can return 10x, 50x, or more
   - High variance in returns

2. **Active involvement:**
   - VCs don't just provide money
   - Take board seats
   - Provide strategic guidance
   - Help recruit management
   - Monitor performance closely

3. **Equity participation:**
   - Receive ownership stake (typically preferred stock)
   - Share in upside through equity appreciation
   - Convertible securities common

4. **Limited time horizon:**
   - Typically 5-10 year investment horizon
   - Exit through IPO or acquisition
   - Not permanent capital

5. **Sector expertise:**
   - Often specialize in specific industries (tech, healthcare, etc.)
   - Develop deep knowledge of particular markets
   - Leverage expertise across portfolio companies

**What types of businesses do VCs finance?**

**VCs finance early-stage, high-growth potential companies, especially:**

1. **Technology companies:**
   - Software
   - Internet/digital businesses
   - Biotechnology
   - Clean tech

2. **High-growth potential:**
   - Possibility of 10x-100x returns
   - Large addressable markets
   - Scalable business models

3. **Early-stage:**
   - Seed stage: Just an idea or prototype
   - Early stage: Product development, initial customers
   - Growth stage: Scaling operations

4. **Innovative/disruptive:**
   - New technologies
   - New business models
   - Potential to disrupt existing industries

5. **High uncertainty:**
   - Unproven technologies
   - Unproven markets
   - Unproven teams
   - Extreme uncertainty about success

**VCs do NOT typically finance:**
- Traditional businesses (restaurants, retail, local services)
- Low-growth businesses
- Late-stage mature companies (private equity focuses here)
- Lifestyle businesses (no exit strategy)

---

## Question 7: Separation of Ownership and Control

**Berle and Means' problem:** In public corporations, there are so many diffuse owners that no single owner has incentive to monitor. Managers have too much power and can act in self-interested ways.

**Does this problem arise in VC-backed companies? NO - quite the opposite.**

**In VC-backed companies:**

1. **Concentrated ownership:**
   - One or a few VCs own large stakes
   - Have strong incentive to monitor
   - Benefit directly from good monitoring

2. **Disproportionate control:**
   - VCs often control board majority even with minority equity
   - Have veto rights over major decisions
   - Can fire the entrepreneur/CEO
   - **More control than equity ownership would suggest**

3. **Active monitoring:**
   - Board participation
   - Regular contact with management
   - Review of financials and operations
   - Access to information

4. **Staged financing as control:**
   - Decision to continue funding is a control mechanism
   - Creates ongoing leverage
   - Forces periodic performance review

**Comparison:**

| Aspect | Public Corporation | VC-Backed Company |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Ownership | Diffuse (thousands of shareholders) | Concentrated (few VCs) |
| Control | Managers have control | VCs have disproportionate control |
| Monitoring | Weak (free-rider problem) | Intense (VCs have incentive and ability) |
| Agency costs | High (managers unchecked) | Managed through control rights |

**Key insight:** VC structures stand Berle-Means on its head. Instead of separation of ownership and control, VC-backed companies have control disproportionate to ownership.

**Why this works:**
- Addresses extreme agency costs in early-stage companies
- Aligns incentives through intense monitoring
- Compensates entrepreneur for loss of control through equity appreciation
- Transfers control back to entrepreneur upon successful exit (IPO)

---

## Question 8: Why Do VCs Specialize?

**VCs often specialize in particular sectors (e.g., software, biotech, clean energy). Why?**

**1. Expertise and knowledge:**
- Deep understanding of technology
- Know the key players in the industry
- Understand market dynamics
- Can better assess technical feasibility

**2. Networks:**
- Relationships with potential customers, partners, acquirers
- Know other investors in the space
- Can make valuable introductions
- Access to talent (engineers, scientists)

**3. Pattern recognition:**
- Have seen many similar companies
- Can identify what works and what doesn't
- Recognize warning signs
- Understand common failure modes

**4. Credibility:**
- Other market participants respect their judgment
- Their endorsement signals quality
- Helps with recruiting, partnerships, future financing

**5. Due diligence efficiency:**
- Know what to look for
- Can assess opportunities more quickly
- Lower cost of investigation
- More accurate evaluation

**6. Portfolio synergies:**
- Companies can learn from each other
- Potential partnerships between portfolio companies
- Shared best practices
- Economies of scope

**7. Marketing:**
- Known as the "go-to" investor for a sector
- Entrepreneurs seek them out
- See more deals
- Better deal flow

**Example:**
- A VC specializing in biotech understands:
  - The science and regulatory pathway
  - Clinical trial process
  - FDA requirements
  - Time horizon for drug development
  - Key risks and how to mitigate them

This expertise is far more valuable than generalist knowledge.

---

## Question 9: Staged vs. One-Time Investment

**Do VCs invest all at once or in stages? IN STAGES.**

**Why staged financing?**

**1. Addresses uncertainty:**
- Early-stage businesses have extreme uncertainty
- No one knows if technology will work
- No one knows if market will accept product
- Staging allows learning before committing more capital

**2. Creates powerful incentives:**
- Entrepreneur knows continued funding depends on performance
- Must meet milestones to get next tranche
- Reduces agency costs
- Aligns interests

**3. Information production:**
- Each stage reveals information about:
  - Technical feasibility
  - Market acceptance
  - Entrepreneur's capabilities
  - Team quality
- Allows better decision-making

**4. Risk management:**
- Limits exposure if things go poorly
- Can abandon project after learning more
- Reduces maximum loss
- Option to abandon is valuable

**5. Monopsony power (for VC):**
- If entrepreneur performs but still needs money
- VC has significant bargaining power
- Can demand more equity or better terms
- (Constrained by reputation)

**6. Signal quality:**
- Good entrepreneurs confident they'll meet milestones
- Bad entrepreneurs prefer guaranteed funding
- Separates high-quality from low-quality entrepreneurs

**Example from Learn-Online:**
- Stage 1: Develop website (milestone: working prototype)
- Stage 2: Hire faculty and launch courses (milestone: course offerings)
- Stage 3: Scale and acquire customers (milestone: revenue targets)

At each stage, VC decides whether to continue based on progress.

## Question 10: Beth's Cold Cure Investment

### The Offer

**Beth proposes:**
- You invest $1,000
- She develops cure for common cold
- If successful: Your $1,000 is worth $100,000
- If fails: You get nothing
- High risk, high reward

### Risks You See

**1. Uncertainty:**
- Developing a cure is scientifically uncertain
- Might not work
- High probability of failure
- This is exogenous risk (outside your control)

**2. Information asymmetry:**
- Beth knows more about:
  - The science
  - Her capabilities
  - The progress so far
  - The challenges
- You have less information
- Can't accurately assess probability of success

**3. Agency costs:**
- Beth might not work as hard as promised
- Beth might misuse funds
- Beth's incentives may not align with yours
- You can't monitor effectively

**4. Moral hazard:**
- Once she has your money
- Her incentive to work hard might diminish
- Or she might take risks you wouldn't want
- Difficult to contractually prevent

### A. Does Diversification Help?

**If this is one of several investments you make: Does diversification help with:**

**Uncertainty? YES**
- Diversification reduces idiosyncratic risk
- Some investments will succeed, some will fail
- Average out to more predictable return
- Law of large numbers applies

**Asymmetric information? NOT MUCH**
- Each investment has information asymmetry
- Diversifying doesn't give you better information about any one investment
- You still have less information than each entrepreneur
- But your portfolio doesn't depend on getting any one investment perfectly right

**Agency costs? NOT MUCH**
- Each entrepreneur still has agency problems
- Diversification doesn't reduce agency costs in any one company
- Actually makes it worse: you can't effectively monitor many investments
- Creates free-rider problem in monitoring

**Key insight:** Diversification solves uncertainty but not information or agency problems. In fact, it makes monitoring harder.

### B. Does Your Expertise Help?

**If you have expertise in drug development:**

**Uncertainty? YES, HELPS**
- Better able to assess scientific feasibility
- Understand technical challenges
- More accurate probability assessment
- Can identify which approaches are promising

**Asymmetric information? YES, HELPS**
- Can ask better questions
- Understand technical answers
- Identify when entrepreneurs are overstating progress
- Level the information gap

**Agency costs? YES, HELPS**
- Can monitor more effectively
- Know what milestones are realistic
- Can assess whether entrepreneur is working hard
- Better able to evaluate performance

**Key insight:** Expertise addresses all three problems, but is expensive to acquire. This is why VCs specialize.

### C. Beth's Wealth - Is It Relevant?

**If Beth is very wealthy and can finance herself:**

**YES, this is highly relevant!**

**Why it matters:**

1. **Signals confidence:**
   - If Beth won't invest her own money, why should you?
   - "Skin in the game" reveals information
   - Wealthy entrepreneur who won't invest = bad signal

2. **Incentive alignment:**
   - If Beth has her own money at risk
   - Her interests are more aligned with yours
   - She bears downside risk
   - Increases motivation to succeed

3. **Information revelation:**
   - Beth's willingness to invest reveals her assessment of success probability
   - If she's wealthy but won't invest, she thinks it will fail
   - Valuable information for you

4. **Commitment mechanism:**
   - Money in the pool = committed to project
   - Can't easily abandon
   - Shows serious commitment

5. **Moral hazard reduction:**
   - If Beth's own money is at risk
   - She has stronger incentive to work hard
   - Less likely to waste resources

**Key insight:** "Skin in the game" is a powerful signal and incentive-alignment mechanism.

### D. Beth Doing Research for Graduate Work - Is It Relevant?

**If Beth is doing this research as part of graduate work in biochemistry:**

**How this is HELPFUL:**

1. **Access to resources:**
   - University lab facilities
   - Equipment
   - Other researchers
   - Reduces cost of research

2. **Quality control:**
   - Faculty advisors supervise work
   - Academic standards apply
   - Peer review of research
   - More rigorous than independent research

3. **Credibility:**
   - Academic affiliation signals seriousness
   - Research is part of degree program
   - Commitment to field
   - Not fly-by-night operation

4. **Accountability:**
   - Must report progress to advisors
   - Academic milestones
   - Thesis requirements
   - External oversight

**How this is UNHELPFUL:**

1. **IP ownership issues:**
   - University may own intellectual property
   - Complex licensing arrangements
   - Unclear who owns the cure
   - Complicates commercialization

2. **Conflicting incentives:**
   - Academic goals (publication) vs. commercial goals (secrecy)
   - Different timelines
   - Different measures of success
   - Potential conflicts

3. **Distraction:**
   - Coursework requirements
   - Teaching or research assistant duties
   - Degree requirements
   - Not focused full-time on venture

4. **Slow progress:**
   - Academic research moves slowly
   - May not align with business timeline
   - Publication delays
   - Bureaucratic hurdles

**Key insight:** Institutional context matters. University involvement brings both benefits and complications.

### E. Beth Plays a Lot of Golf - Is It Relevant?

**YES - this is relevant as a signal of work ethic and focus.**

**Why it matters:**

1. **Time allocation:**
   - Time playing golf = time not working on cure
   - Suggests lack of focus
   - Not fully committed to project

2. **Work ethic signal:**
   - Indicates priorities
   - May not be working as hard as possible
   - Questionable dedication

3. **Information about entrepreneur type:**
   - Serious entrepreneurs work long hours
   - Especially in early-stage startups
   - Golf suggests not treating this as primary focus

4. **Agency cost concern:**
   - If you invest, she might play golf instead of working
   - Your money funding her leisure time
   - Misallocation of resources

**But caution:**
- Maybe she plays golf to network with investors
- Maybe she's extremely efficient and works hard enough
- Don't over-interpret

**Key insight:** Actions reveal priorities and work ethic. Investors care about how entrepreneurs spend their time.

### F. Can We Use a Contract to Address These Risks?

**Can contractual provisions help? SOMEWHAT, but it's hard.**

**Why it's HARD:**

1. **Incomplete contracting:**
   - Can't specify every action Beth should take
   - Can't anticipate all future scenarios
   - Can't contractually mandate "work hard"
   - Can't specify "good research" vs. "bad research"

2. **Measurement problems:**
   - How do you measure effort?
   - How do you measure scientific progress?
   - How do you distinguish between honest failure and lack of effort?
   - Information asymmetry makes monitoring difficult

3. **Enforcement costs:**
   - Litigation is expensive
   - Even if you can prove breach, remedies may be inadequate
   - By the time you sue, the money is gone
   - Judgment-proof problem

4. **Dynamic uncertainty:**
   - Science doesn't follow a predictable path
   - Can't specify in advance what actions are appropriate
   - Need flexibility to respond to unexpected developments
   - Contract can't address all contingencies

**What contracts CAN do:**

1. **Milestone-based funding:**
   - Release money only as goals achieved
   - Creates incentives to perform
   - Reduces exposure

2. **Monitoring rights:**
   - Access to information
   - Regular reports
   - Board observation rights

3. **Vesting/forfeiture:**
   - Beth's equity vests over time
   - If she stops working, loses unvested shares
   - Creates ongoing incentive

4. **Staged financing:**
   - Invest in tranches based on progress
   - Option to abandon if things go poorly
   - Reduces risk

5. **Covenants:**
   - Restrictions on certain actions
   - Requirements for others
   - Use of funds restrictions

**But these are imperfect solutions.**

**Key insight:** Some risks (uncertainty, information asymmetry, agency costs) cannot be fully addressed through explicit contracts. Need other mechanisms.

### G. "An Organization Can Substitute for a Contract"

**AGREE - this is a key insight.**

**What does this mean?**

When explicit contracts are incomplete (which they always are), organizational structures and governance mechanisms can substitute for detailed contractual provisions.

**Examples:**

1. **VC control rights:**
   - Instead of specifying what entrepreneur can do
   - Give VC board control and veto rights
   - VC can respond to unforeseen circumstances
   - Organizational structure substitutes for detailed contract

2. **Monitoring and oversight:**
   - Instead of contracting specific actions
   - Create mechanisms for ongoing monitoring
   - Board meetings, reporting requirements
   - Allows flexible response

3. **Staged financing:**
   - Instead of specifying all milestones upfront
   - Create structure for ongoing decision-making
   - VC can adapt to new information
   - Governance mechanism, not contract

4. **Reputation and repeat play:**
   - Instead of detailed enforcement provisions
   - Rely on reputation markets
   - Future dealings constrain current behavior
   - Market discipline substitutes for legal enforcement

5. **Equity compensation:**
   - Instead of specifying work effort
   - Give entrepreneur equity
   - Creates incentive to maximize value
   - Organizational alignment substitutes for contract

**Why this works:**

- Contracts are inherently incomplete
- Can't specify every contingency
- Organizational structures provide flexibility
- Allow adaptation to unforeseen circumstances
- Create ongoing decision-making mechanisms

**In venture capital:**
- Explicit contracts (stock purchase agreement, voting agreements)
- Plus organizational structures (board seats, veto rights, staging)
- Plus market mechanisms (reputation, future fundraising)
- Work together to address uncertainty, information asymmetry, and agency costs

**Key insight:** Transactional lawyers design organizational structures, not just contracts. The "deal" is the entire governance system, not just the legal documents.

## Question 11: Entrepreneur Compensation

### Would Equity Compensation Help?

**Situation:** Beth paid small cash salary, main compensation is shares in the venture.

**Does this help? YES - significantly.**

**Why equity compensation is better:**

1. **Aligns incentives:**
   - Beth's wealth increases with venture success
   - She benefits directly from creating value
   - Reduces agency costs
   - Her interests now aligned with investors

2. **Creates intense performance incentives:**
   - Beth works harder because she directly benefits
   - Willingness to accept equity signals confidence
   - Good entrepreneurs willing to bear risk
   - Bad entrepreneurs prefer guaranteed salary

3. **Reduces cash needs:**
   - Venture has limited cash
   - Conserves cash for operations
   - Equity is "cheaper" for cash-poor startups

4. **Skin in the game:**
   - Beth bears downside risk
   - Committed to success
   - Reveals confidence in venture

5. **Long-term commitment:**
   - Equity only valuable if venture succeeds long-term
   - Creates focus on sustainable value creation
   - Not just short-term metrics

**How entrepreneurs are typically paid in VC deals:**

1. **Modest cash salary:**
   - Below market rate
   - Just enough to live on
   - Usually $50k-$100k for early-stage startups

2. **Substantial equity ownership:**
   - Founder typically owns 20-50% after VC investment
   - Additional equity in form of options
   - Potential for large upside if company succeeds

3. **Vesting requirements:**
   - Equity vests over time (typically 4 years)
   - If entrepreneur leaves early, loses unvested shares
   - Creates incentive to stay
   - Protects company from departure

**Why this structure:**

- Addresses agency costs through incentive alignment
- Conserves scarce cash resources
- Signals entrepreneur confidence
- Creates commitment to long-term success
- Aligns time horizons between entrepreneur and investors

**Key insight:** Equity compensation transforms the agency problem. Instead of monitoring to prevent bad behavior, structure incentives so entrepreneur wants what investors want.

## Question 12: Steve's Computer Company - VC Control

### A. Is It Typical for VCs to Control Before IPO?

**YES - this is typical.**

**VC control before IPO:**
- VC gets 4 of 6 board seats (67%)
- Despite owning only ⅓ of equity
- Disproportionate control relative to ownership

**This is standard in VC-backed companies.**

### B. Why or Why Not?

**Why VCs get disproportionate control:**

**1. Address agency costs:**
- Entrepreneurs have option-like compensation
- Tend to take too much risk
- VC control can limit risky decisions
- Oversee entrepreneur's actions

**2. Need for monitoring:**
- Extreme uncertainty in early-stage companies
- Needs frequent course corrections
- VC control enables active involvement
- Board representation gives oversight

**3. Information asymmetry:**
- Entrepreneur knows more than VC
- Control gives VC access to information
- Board seats, reporting requirements
- Reduces information gap

**4. Value-add:**
- VCs bring expertise, relationships
- Need authority to help strategically
- Can't just provide advice without ability to enforce
- Control makes their involvement meaningful

**5. Protection of investment:**
- Early-stage investments are very risky
- VC needs mechanisms to protect investment
- Control rights allow intervention if things go poorly
- Can replace management if necessary

**6. Signal confidence:**
- Entrepreneurs willing to give control signal confidence
- Only good entrepreneurs willing to accept this
- Bad entrepreneurs need guarantees
- Separates high-quality from low-quality

### C. Risk for Entrepreneur in Giving VC Control

**What risk does entrepreneur take?**

**1. Loss of job:**
- VC can fire entrepreneur as CEO
- Even though entrepreneur founded company
- Even if entrepreneur owns more equity than VC
- **Loss of control over employment**

**2. Loss of strategic direction:**
- VC can force different strategy
- May push for faster growth
- May push for earlier exit (IPO or sale)
- Entrepreneur's vision may be overruled

**3. Dilution of authority:**
- Major decisions require VC approval
- Hiring, firing, acquisitions, financing
- Entrepreneur loses autonomy
- Day-to-day operations constrained

**4. Replacement risk:**
- If performance disappoints
- Even if not entrepreneur's fault
- Market conditions might trigger VC intervention
- Entrepreneur bears risk of circumstances beyond control

**5. Value extraction:**
- VC might push for exit that benefits VC more than entrepreneur
- Timing might not be optimal for entrepreneur
- Exit price might not maximize entrepreneur's return

**Why entrepreneurs accept this risk:**

**1. No alternatives:**
- Without VC funding, business might not exist at all
- Trade-off: some company with risk vs. no company
- Necessary to access capital

**2. Potential upside:**
- If successful, entrepreneur's equity very valuable
- Even as employee, not CEO, shares worth a lot
- Financial risk worth taking

**3. Learning and reputation:**
- Even if fired, experience valuable
- Reputation for having VC-backed company
- Helps with future ventures

**4. Call option on control:**
- If company succeeds, entrepreneur regains control
- Through IPO (automatic conversion of preferred to common)
- VC control rights extinguished
- **Entrepreneur gets control back if successful**

### D. When Do VCs Lose Control Rights? What Incentive Does This Create?

**VCs lose control at IPO (or sometimes at sale).**

**How this happens:**

1. **Automatic conversion:**
   - Preferred stock automatically converts to common at IPO
   - Special board rights disappear
   - VC no longer has disproportionate control
   - One shareholder, one vote

2. **Negative covenants expire:**
   - VC veto rights over major decisions expire
   - Company can act without VC approval
   - Entrepreneur regains autonomy

3. **New board composition:**
   - IPO board typically more independent
   - VC representation diluted
   - Entrepreneur often remains as CEO

**The incentive created:**

**Entrepreneur has a CALL OPTION on control.**

- If company succeeds: VC exits via IPO, entrepreneur regains control
- If company fails: VC controls, entrepreneur might be fired
- Entrepreneur's payoff:
  - Success: Keep job + huge wealth from equity
  - Failure: Lose job + little or no wealth from equity

**This creates powerful performance incentive:**

- Entrepreneur works hard to achieve IPO
- VC knows this and structures deal accordingly
- Both parties aligned on goal of successful exit
- Entrepreneur motivated to maximize value to regain control

**Key insight:** This is an elegant solution to agency costs. Transfer control temporarily to VC, then return it to entrepreneur upon success. Entrepreneur gets "call option" on control.

### E. Why VC Might Hesitate to Fire Entrepreneur

**Even if VC has legal right to fire, might hesitate:**

**1. Disruption costs:**
- Firing founder/CEO is disruptive
- Morale problems
- Other employees might leave
- Relationships with customers/suppliers damaged

**2. Information loss:**
- Entrepreneur has unique knowledge
- Understanding of technology
- Relationships with key stakeholders
- Hard to replace this knowledge

**3. Reputation consequences:**
- Other entrepreneurs will hear about it
- Might have trouble attracting future deals
- Signaled as "founder-unfriendly"
- Reduces deal flow

**4. Legal risk:**
- Potential lawsuits from entrepreneur
- Employment law claims
- Breach of fiduciary duties claims
- Even if ultimately successful, litigation costly

**5. Replacement difficulty:**
- Hard to find qualified replacement
- New CEO needs time to learn business
- Risk that replacement worse
- Recruiting expensive and time-consuming

**6. Market signal:**
- Firing founder signals problems to market
- Other investors become cautious
- Future financing more difficult
- Employees get nervous

**7. Performance evidence:**
- Maybe failure isn't entrepreneur's fault
- Market conditions, technological problems, etc.
- Firing entrepreneur might not fix problem

**8. Relationship capital:**
- Good relationships with entrepreneur valuable
- Entrepreneur might be key to future success
- Irreplaceable vision or leadership qualities

**Key insight:** Control rights are not the same as willingness to exercise them. VCs have the power but are constrained by reputational, operational, and economic considerations.

## Question 13: VC-Investor Relationship

### A. Information and Incentive Problems in VC Funds

**Are there incentive and information problems when universities, pension funds invest in VCs? YES - parallel to VC-entrepreneur problems.**

**Comparison:**

**VC investing in entrepreneur:**
- **Uncertainty:** Extreme uncertainty about startup success
- **Information asymmetry:** Entrepreneur knows more than VC
- **Agency costs:** Entrepreneur might not work hard, might misuse funds

**University investing in VC:**
- **Uncertainty:** Uncertainty about which VC funds will succeed
- **Information asymmetry:** VC knows more about its abilities, investments, and strategy than university
- **Agency costs:** VC might not work as hard, might take excessive risks, might charge high fees while underperforming

**How they compare:**

**Similarities:**
1. Both involve expert investor (VC or GP) dealing with less informed capital provider
2. Both have information asymmetry about skill and effort
3. Both have agency costs where expert might not act in investor's best interest
4. Both need mechanisms to align incentives and monitor performance

**Differences:**
1. **VCs more diversified than entrepreneurs:**
   - VC invests in 10-20 companies
   - Entrepreneur's wealth tied to single company
   - Reduces but doesn't eliminate agency problems

2. **Information problems less severe for VC-investor relationship:**
   - VC track record more observable than entrepreneur's
   - VC returns are measurable
   - Can compare performance across funds
   - Harder to assess pre-revenue startup

3. **Agency costs differ:**
   - VC has option-like compensation (carried interest)
   - Might take too much risk (like entrepreneur)
   - Or might harvest winners early to boost track record
   - Or might not work hard enough

4. **Monitoring more feasible:**
   - University can review VC's investments
   - Can assess performance over time
   - Can talk to other investors
   - Harder for university to monitor portfolio companies directly

### B. How Do Universities Compensate VCs?

**VC compensation structure:**

1. **Annual management fee:**
   - Typically 2% of committed capital
   - Pays for VC's operating expenses
   - Salaries, office, due diligence costs
   - Independent of investment performance

2. **Carried interest:**
   - Typically 20% of fund's profits
   - Only after investors receive their capital back (sometimes with interest)
   - Example: Fund returns 3x capital
     - Investors get their investment back
     - Remaining profits split 80% to investors, 20% to VC

**Why this form:**

**1. Aligns incentives:**
- Carried interest gives VC stake in fund's success
- Benefits from good investments
- Hurt by bad investments
- VC and investors both want high returns

**2. Addresses agency costs:**
- If VC only got management fee
- Would collect fees regardless of performance
- No incentive to work hard or pick good investments
- Carried interest creates performance incentive

**3. Pays for expertise:**
- Management fee compensates for time and effort
- Carried interest rewards skill and success
- Combination ensures VC compensated for work AND results

**4. Skin in the game:**
- VC typically invests 1% of fund capital
- Shows commitment
- Bears some downside risk
- Signals confidence

**5. Market standard:**
- This is the industry convention
- Deviating would signal something
- Investors expect this structure

### C. Fund Structure - Fixed Term

**Is there a date when university gets money back? NO fixed date, but fixed term (typically 10 years).**

**How VC funds are structured:**

1. **Fixed term:**
   - Typically 10-year life
   - Can be extended a few years with investor consent
   - At end of term, fund must be liquidated
   - All investments sold, proceeds distributed

2. **Capital calls:**
   - Investors commit capital but don't invest immediately
   - VC "calls" capital as needed for investments
   - 3-5 year investment period, then harvest period

3. **Mandatory distributions:**
   - When investments sold (IPO or acquisition)
   - Proceeds MUST be distributed to investors
   - VC cannot reinvest without new fund
   - Ensures investors can measure performance

4. **Limited partnership structure:**
   - VC = general partner (GP)
   - Investors = limited partners (LPs)
   - LPs have no control over day-to-day decisions
   - GP has virtually complete control

**Why structured this way:**

**1. Performance measurement:**
   - Fixed term ensures there's an end point
   - Investors can assess GP's performance
   - Can decide whether to invest in GP's next fund
   - Creates market discipline

**2. Prevents "zombie" funds:**
   - Forces GP to exit investments
   - Can't hold losers forever hoping they'll recover
   - Must liquidate and return capital
   - Allows investors to redeploy capital

**3. Addresses free cash flow problem:**
   - Without mandatory distributions and fixed term
   - GP might keep investing management fees
   - Would never have to prove performance
   - Would have permanent "piggy bank"

**4. Fundraising cycle:**
   - GP raises new fund every 3-5 years
   - Performance of prior funds critical to raising next fund
   - Creates ongoing incentive to perform
   - Reputation market operates through fundraising cycle

**5. Locks up capital:**
   - Investors know capital committed for 10 years
   - GP can make long-term investments
   - No early withdrawals (with limited exceptions)
   - Provides stability

**Key insight:** Fixed term + mandatory distributions ensure market can measure GP performance. This constrains GP agency costs through reputation and future fundraising needs.

## Question 14: University's Investment in VC Fund

### A. VC's Carried Interest from Investment A

**Facts:**
- University invests $1 million with VC
- VC invests $500k in Venture A
- After 2 years, Venture A sold for $1 million
- University doubled its money on Investment A
- 10% annual return on $500k over 2 years ≈ $100,000
- Profit above 10% = $500,000 - $100,000 = $400,000
- VC gets 20% of profits above 10% hurdle

**Calculation:**
- VC's carried interest = 20% × $400,000 = **$80,000**

**VC receives $80,000 from this investment.**

### B. Investment B Goes Bankrupt - Is There a Problem?

**Situation:**
- Investment A: $400,000 profit above 10% hurdle
- VC received $80,000 carried interest
- Investment B: $500,000 loss (total loss)
- No profit = no carried interest from Investment B

**The problem:**

**VC has received $80,000 of carried interest based on Investment A's profits.**
**But overall fund performance:**
- Invested $1,000 total ($500k + $500k)
- Returned $1,000 from Investment A
- Lost $500k from Investment B
- **Total: -$500,000 overall LOSS**
- Yet VC has already received $80,000 of "profit sharing"

**This is clearly wrong:**
- VC is supposed to get 20% of PROFITS
- Fund has no profits, has losses
- But VC already kept $80,000
- VC's effective share = $80,000/(-$500,000) = Not 20% of anything

**This creates agency cost:**
- VC has incentive to realize winners early
- Lock in carried interest
- Even if fund overall loses money
- "Harvest" winners to boost track record

### C. What Is a Clawback?

**Clawback provision:**
- GP must return some previously distributed carried interest
- Ensures GP ultimately receives only agreed % of total profits
- If early distributions prove too generous relative to final results
- GP must return excess to investors

**How it works:**
- VC's carried interest held back or subject to escrow
- Or GP required to return excess if fund underperforms
- At end of fund term, final calculation performed
- GP receives exactly 20% of net profits

**Why included:**
1. **Addresses premature harvesting problem**
2. **Ensures GP takes long-term view**
3. **Aligns incentives with investors**
4. **Prevents gaming of carried interest calculations**

**In this example:**
- At end, fund has $500k loss
- VC should receive $0 carried interest
- VC must return the $80,000 previously received
- This is the clawback

### D. Tax Treatment of Carried Interest

**Is carried interest more like salary or investment?**

**Economically:** It's like investment (share of profits)
**Legally:** Taxed as capital gains (currently)

**Why controversy:**
- VC contributes small amount of capital (1%)
- Receives 20% of profits
- This looks like compensation for services
- Should be taxed as ordinary income
- But currently taxed as lower-rate capital gains

**Tax treatment:**
- Carried interest currently taxed as capital gains (20% rate)
- Not as ordinary income (up to 37% rate)
- Significant tax benefit for VCs
- Subject to political controversy

**Policy debate:**
- Should carried interest be taxed as ordinary income?
- VCs argue it's investment return
- Critics argue it's compensation for services
- Issue comes up periodically in tax reform debates

---

## Question 15: Typical LP Agreement Terms

**Which terms likely appear in University-VC agreement?**

### A. Capital Returned by Set Date

**LIKELY YES**
- Limited partnership has fixed term (typically 10 years)
- Capital must be returned by then (with limited exceptions)
- Provides certainty to investors
- Forces GP to exit investments
- Allows performance measurement

### B. GP Cannot Sell/Transfer Partnership Interest

**LIKELY YES**
- Investors chose THIS GP
- Don't want unknown replacement
- Protects investors from unwanted new partners
- Requires investor consent for transfer

### C. GP Cannot Invest in Related Businesses

**LIKELY YES**
- Conflict of interest concern
- GP might invest in businesses owned by family/partners
- Could divert good deals to personal accounts
- Self-dealing risk
- Requires investor consent for related-party transactions

### D. GP Cannot Operate Other Funds

**LIKELY YES (with nuances)**
- Investors want GP's full attention
- Concern about divided loyalties
- Conflict of interest between funds
- **But:** In practice, GPs DO raise multiple overlapping funds
- Typically structured as:
  - Main fund + smaller "opportunity funds"
  - Or different strategies (early stage vs. late stage)
  - Or different geographic focuses
  - Investors consent to related funds

**More likely terms:**
- GP can raise successor funds
- GP must give existing investors right to invest in new funds
- GP must allocate investment opportunities fairly among funds
- No preferential treatment of one fund over another

## Key Takeaways

### The Three Core Problems in VC

**1. Uncertainty**
- Extreme uncertainty about startup success
- Technology feasibility unknown
- Market acceptance unknown
- Team quality uncertain

**2. Information Asymmetry**
- Entrepreneur knows more than VC
- About technology, market, team, progress
- VC has limited ability to verify information
- Creates adverse selection problem

**3. Agency Costs**
- Entrepreneur's interests may not align with VC's
- Option-like compensation encourages risk-taking
- Entrepreneur might not work hard
- Might misuse resources

### VC Contractual Responses

**Staged Financing:**
- Addresses all three problems
- Reduces uncertainty by learning over time
- Creates information at each milestone
- Incentivizes performance (agency)
- Signals entrepreneur confidence (information)

**Control Rights:**
- Disproportionate control relative to equity
- Addresses agency costs through oversight
- Addresses information asymmetry through monitoring
- Creates option to abandon
- Transfers discretion from entrepreneur to VC

**Compensation Structure:**
- Entrepreneur gets modest salary + substantial equity
- Aligns incentives (addresses agency)
- Signals confidence (addresses information)
- But creates risk-taking incentive (agency problem persists)

**Exit as Incentive:**
- Entrepreneur gets call option on control
- Regains control at IPO
- Powerful incentive to achieve success
- Addresses all three problems

### Reputation Market

**The conservation of discretion principle:**
- Transferring discretion from entrepreneur to VC doesn't eliminate agency costs
- Just shifts them to VC
- VC can behave opportunistically
- Need mechanism to constrain VC

**Reputation market as constraint:**
- VC needs to raise successive funds
- Depends on reputation with entrepreneurs
- Bad behavior → poor deal flow → can't raise next fund
- Geographic concentration (Sand Hill Road) facilitates information flow
- Repeat players, shared norms, observability

**This supports the entire VC structure:**
- Makes it safe to transfer discretion to VCs
- Allows intense incentives coupled with intense monitoring
- Enables staged financing and control rights
- Without reputation market, structure would collapse

### Investor-VC Relationship

**Parallel problems:**
- Investors face uncertainty, information asymmetry, and agency costs with VCs
- Similar to VC-entrepreneur relationship but different scale

**Contractual responses:**
- Management fee + carried interest (incentive alignment)
- Fixed term + mandatory distributions (performance measurement)
- Clawback provisions (premature harvesting problem)
- Limited partnership structure (GP control, LP capital)

**Braiding of contracts:**
- VC-entrepreneur contract and Investor-VC contract are intertwined
- Reputation market spans both relationships
- Exit from portfolio companies enables performance measurement of GP
- Need to raise new funds gives GP incentive to treat entrepreneurs well
- Interaction between contracts increases efficiency of both

### Economic Insights

**1. Options are powerful:**
- Staged financing = VC's option to abandon
- Entrepreneur's equity = call option on wealth
- Entrepreneur's control = call option on control
- Carried interest = GP's call option on fund performance

**2. Information revelation:**
- Willingness to accept intense incentives signals confidence
- Investment decisions reveal information (Schoolco declining)
- Skin in the game reveals beliefs about quality
- Staged financing reveals information over time

**3. Governance over contracts:**
- Explicit contracts incomplete
- Organizational structures substitute for detailed contracts
- Control rights, monitoring, market discipline
- System of incentives and constraints

**4. Path dependence:**
- Current deal structures affect future bargaining
- Create and limit future options
- Rights of first refusal
- Vesting provisions
- Staged financing

---

## Notes for Class Discussion

- **Staged financing is the central innovation** - understanding why it matters
- **Control rights are disproportionate** - more control than equity is normal in VC
- **Everything is about incentives** - intense incentives require intense monitoring
- **Information is central** - all contractual choices reveal information
- **Reputation markets are crucial** - constrain VC opportunism
- **Options are everywhere** - option thinking helps understand VC structure
- **Structure is holistic** - explicit contracts + governance + market mechanisms work together
