**Date:** 2026

## Key Concepts Overview

### 1. The core “Deals” move in this class
This class is the course themes in a familiar setting (buying a house):

- **Information asymmetry:** seller usually knows more about defects and history.
- **Uncertainty:** some things can’t be known until later (e.g., pool systems in winter).
- **Incentives / moral hazard:** if Seller fixes something, Seller may do it cheaply; if Buyer is “insured,” Buyer may underinvest in care.

### 2. Due diligence (DD): what it is and why it matters
**Due diligence** is the buyer’s process of reducing information gaps by investigating the asset (inspections, searches, questions, third-party experts).

- DD doesn’t just reveal *facts*; it also reveals *signals* (e.g., shifting or evasive answers).
- DD is often paired with **walk-away rights** (inspection contingency / “free look”) and/or **reps + remedies** if information is wrong.

### 3. A simple principle for “who pays” for DD / fixes
A practical way to allocate costs (especially when bargaining is tough):

1. **Would future buyers care?** (health/safety, legality, ability to use property)
2. **Would future buyers learn?** (will it likely be detected in ordinary DD?)
3. **Who controls / best knows / can fix cheapest?** (seller knowledge + ability to remediate)

If the answer to (1) and (2) is “yes,” Seller is more likely to bear the cost (or pay via price reduction/credit). If it’s Buyer’s idiosyncratic preference (aesthetics), Buyer pays.

### 4. The recurring toolkit (you should be ready to name these in class)

| Tool | What it does | Why it helps here |
|---|---|---|
| **Inspection contingency / free look** | Buyer can walk if DD is bad | Lets Buyer spend on DD without being trapped |
| **Representation & warranty (rep)** | Seller states facts in contract | Turns info into enforceable promise |
| **Survival** | Rep remains enforceable after closing | Otherwise closing “wipes out” the rep |
| **Escrow / holdback** | Some price held by third party | Makes remedies realistic (avoids chasing Seller) |
| **Price adjustment / credit** | Changes economics without full litigation | Often easier than forcing specific performance |
| **Third-party certification** | Neutral expert decides facts/costs | Avoids “everything is aesthetic” disputes |

## Question 1: Underground Oil Tank (DD + allocating DD costs)

### A. Should Bob conduct a scan for an old underground oil tank?

**YES.**

Immediate reasoning: the downside risk (contamination + remediation + stigma) is large, and Susan refuses a strong, surviving rep—so DD is Bob’s main protection.

Key points:
- **Low cost vs. high tail risk:** \$1,000 scan vs. potentially very large remediation costs if leakage is discovered later.
- **Bad signal from shifting answers:** “There aren’t pipes” → “maybe propane” → “excavated around the entire house” → “tank always above ground.” Even if she’s honest, inconsistency lowers confidence.
- **Disclosure form is not enough:** “no underground tank” on a disclosure is not the same as a strong contractual rep that survives closing with a real remedy.
- **A weak rep + no survival is close to no rep:** “to the best of my knowledge” and “does not survive closing” means Bob eats the post-closing risk.

### B. Should Susan share in the cost of the scan? Arguments for Bob

**YES, it is reasonable to ask.**

Arguments you can make for Bob:
- **Everyone cares + everyone would ask:** future buyers generally care about environmental contamination risk; it’s not a “personal preference.”
- **Seller created the information problem:** Susan answered “no” on the disclosure form; if she’s right, paying (or sharing) \$1,000 is a cheap way to make that claim credible.
- **Seller has cheaper access to the truth:** Seller may have records (oil company, prior permits, excavation docs) and can coordinate access more easily.
- **Market practice supports seller bearing the consequences:** if a tank is found, sellers commonly pay removal; scan is the step that determines whether that obligation will be triggered.
- **Bargaining framing:** “If you won’t give a strong rep, you can at least help fund the verification.”

Best practical ask (often more realistic than “you pay”):
- Ask for a **\$1,000 seller credit at closing** (or a small price reduction), conditioned on doing the scan promptly.

Clean compromise that also “tests confidence”:
- Bob pays upfront for the scan, but if a tank is found, Susan reimburses the scan cost (and, consistent with market practice, pays removal/remediation).

### C. If Bob finds a tank and Susan agrees to remove it, how does that affect other issues?

Likely effects (two directions):
- **Improves cooperation / trust (good outcome):** solving one problem can build momentum and reduce fear that Seller is hiding other issues.
- **Hardens positions (bad outcome):** Seller may feel “nickeled and dimed” and become less flexible on later asks; Buyer may become more skeptical and push for stronger protections (escrow, survival, more DD).

Negotiation takeaway: this first “hard” issue can set a tone—either cooperative problem-solving or adversarial bargaining.

## Question 2: Current Oil Tank Venting (safety vs. aesthetics)

### A. What should Bob’s position be about the venting issue?

**Seller should fix it before closing, at Seller’s expense (or give a meaningful escrow/credit).**

Why:
- **Safety/health issue:** risk of exhaust entering the house is not “cosmetic.”
- **Future buyers care:** this is the kind of defect that impacts habitability, insurance, and valuation.
- **Risk allocation:** Seller is better positioned to fix pre-closing (they control the property and access).

What to propose (pick the cleanest mechanism):
- Require repair by a **licensed HVAC/oil-burner contractor**, with **paid invoices + permits/inspection signoff** if applicable.
- Add a **re-inspection right** before closing.
- If timing is tight: **escrow/holdback** sized to cover the fix + a buffer, released only after third-party confirmation.

### B. If Bob doesn’t like the color/appearance of the oil tank, will Susan pay? Same as (A)?

**Probably NO.**

Distinction:
- **Aesthetics are Buyer’s responsibility** because not all future buyers value the same “look.”
- Safety/function defects are different: most buyers care, and they affect insurability and habitability.

Nuance:
- If replacement is the cheapest way to cure the safety defect (venting), then Seller may end up paying for a new tank as part of the functional fix.
- Otherwise, if the tank is safe and functional, “it’s ugly” is a post-closing improvement for Buyer.

## Question 3: Mold in Crawl Space (who cares, who learns, who controls)

### A. If Bob walks away, will other buyers care as much?

**Probably less than Bob, but many will still care.**

- Bob has special sensitivity (allergies/respiratory issues), so his “willingness to pay to fix” is higher.
- But mold can still matter to many buyers because of perceived health risk, stigma, and potential future costs.

### B. If Bob walks away, is another buyer likely to detect the mold?

**It depends on the DD quality, but a real inspection can find it.**

- If mold is visible in an accessible crawl space and an inspector checks, detection is likely.
- If access is hard or inspectors are rushed, Seller may think it can slip through.

### C. Given (A) and (B), what is Susan’s likely position?

Prediction using the “care + learn” framework:
- If Susan believes **future buyers will care and will learn**, she is more likely to address it (or give price relief).
- If she believes **future buyers won’t care or won’t learn**, she will resist and offer cheap “cosmetic” patching (bleach + paint).

### D. If Susan agrees to address it, why might Bob worry? What alternative can he suggest?

**Bob worries about moral hazard / corner-cutting.**

Seller’s incentives:
- Do the cheapest, fastest “cover-up” that gets to closing (bleach/paint), not the durable fix (clean + moisture control).

Better alternatives (Buyer controls the fix):
- **Price reduction** for estimated remediation (clean + pump + dehumidifier), and Buyer does the work post-closing.
- Or **escrow/holdback**: money held back and released only after a **professional remediation company** does the work and provides documentation (and, ideally, a post-remediation inspection).
- Or require Seller to hire a **named, licensed mold remediation firm**, with **scope of work** attached and **proof of completion**.

## Question 4: The Pool (DD limits in winter + contingent purchase price)

### A. What can be investigated before March 1? What cannot?

**Can investigate (mostly visual/legal/safety items):**
- Presence/condition of **fence** (and whether it plausibly meets insurance requirements).
- Whether the pool has **two drains** (depending on accessibility/visibility).
- Some visible condition issues (cracks, obvious structural problems) if not snow-covered.

**Hard/impossible to investigate in late January:**
- Whether **heater, motorized filter, drainage system** actually work under normal operating conditions (can’t run system < 50°F without risking damage).
- Whether there are **leaks/clogs** that only appear during operation.

### B. If Susan insists on closing before March 1, what should Bob suggest?

**Use a contingent purchase price / escrow tied to spring testing.**

Clean structure:
- Close on March 1, but hold back **\$X in escrow**.
- When temperatures allow, a pool company tests systems.
- If systems pass, escrow releases to Seller; if not, escrow releases to Buyer (or pays contractors) to fix.

This is the same “earnout/holdback” logic from business deals, applied to real estate.

Negotiation leverage point:
- If Susan is the one with the timing pressure, Bob can credibly say: “We can just wait until testing is possible,” and use that as leverage to get escrow/price protection if Susan insists on closing early.

### C. Is Susan’s “safety/function vs. aesthetics” distinction reasonable? How to operationalize?

**YES, the distinction is reasonable.**

How to operationalize in writing:
- Define **“Functional/Safety Repairs”** (systems operate as intended; code/safety compliance; no material leaks; equipment works).
- Define **“Aesthetic Upgrades”** (resurfacing for appearance; style choices; optional improvements).
- Use **“like kind and quality”** as the default repair standard: Seller pays to restore functionality and restore appearance to the *pre-repair baseline*.
- If Buyer wants an upgrade beyond baseline, Buyer pays the incremental cost.

### D. Where do disputes arise? What language helps?

Predictable dispute pattern:
- Seller claims expensive work is “aesthetic.”
- Buyer claims expensive work is “functional/safety.”
- Some repairs inherently affect appearance (e.g., opening walls/pool surfaces to reach plumbing).

Helpful drafting moves:
- **Baseline restoration clause:** Seller pays the cost to restore the pool’s appearance to the condition it would have been in absent the defect repair (reasonable matching; no “diamond tiles” upgrades).
- **Upgrade election clause:** Buyer may elect upgrades, but Buyer pays the incremental cost above baseline restoration.
- **Neutral decision-maker:** disputes resolved by a **named pool professional** whose written determination controls escrow release (or is presumptively correct).

## Question 5: Tax Planning in the House Deal (allocation + cliff effects)

### Facts (for calculations)
- Total deal value Bob pays Susan: **\$1,030,000**
- Personal property value: **\$50,000**
- Mansion tax: **1%** if purchase price **≥ \$1,000,000**
- Sales tax on personal property: **8%** if total personal property price **> \$500**
- Annual property tax: **3%** of appraised value (likely tied to purchase price)

### A. If the contract says “no consideration attributable to personal property,” what taxes does Bob owe/avoid?

**Bob likely owes:**
- **Mansion tax:** 1% × \$1,030,000 = **\$10,300**
- **Annual property tax (likely):** 3% × \$1,030,000 = **\$30,900/year**

**Bob likely avoids:**
- **Sales tax on personal property** (because the contract is pretending the personal property price is \$0).

Practical note: even if this avoids sales tax on paper, it has to be **plausible** (and the mismatch between “\$0” and a long inclusions list can be an audit flag).

### B. What conservative (clearly legal) suggestion reduces Bob’s tax bill in coming years?

**Allocate purchase price: house < \$1M; personal property separately (at plausible FMV).**

Example:
- House: **\$980,000**
- Personal property: **\$50,000** (separate bill of sale)
- Total paid remains: **\$1,030,000**

Tax consequences:
- Mansion tax avoided (house price < \$1M): **\$0**
- Sales tax owed on personal property: 8% × \$50,000 = **\$4,000**
- Annual property tax base drops (likely): 3% × \$980,000 = **\$29,400/year** (saving \$1,500/year vs. \$30,900)

Extra intuition (useful if professor pushes): even without the mansion-tax cliff, allocation is a tradeoff between **one-time** sales tax and **recurring** property tax, so the “best” allocation can depend on how long you expect to own the home.

### C. Storm damage + \$2,000 “credit”: what better alternative reduces taxes?

**Treat it as a \$2,000 reduction in the real property purchase price (not a “credit inside the price”).**

Mechanically:
- Reduce house purchase price by \$2,000 and keep total economics the same via how funds flow at closing.

Why:
- Lower “purchase price” helps reduce mansion/property tax exposure (even if modest here, it’s directionally right and clean).

## Question 6: Draft Contract Review (what it does + what to change)

### A. Punch list repairs + licensed contractors + confirming the work

**What the draft does:**
- Rider ¶4: Seller represents appliances/systems in working order at closing.
- Rider ¶5 + Appendix B: Seller completes punch list at Seller’s cost.
- But main contract ¶7 says the deal is **not subject to inspection contingencies** and is **“as is.”**
- Main contract ¶18/¶19: reps generally **do not survive closing** (unless expressly provided).

**What to change (to match Bob’s goal):**
- Require work by **licensed/insured contractors** (and specify documentation: paid invoices, permits, lien waivers).
- Add Buyer right to **re-inspect** after completion and before closing.
- Add an **escrow/holdback** that is released only after verification (especially for hidden electrical work).
- Make these obligations **survive closing** for a short period (or expressly carve them out from the non-survival clause).
- Make the rider expressly **override ¶7** (“as is”) to the extent of the punch list and system representations.

### B. Certificate of occupancy (CO) for guest apartment

**What the draft does:**
- Rider ¶1: COs issued for work performed “for which building permits have been issued.”

**Why that’s weak:**
- It’s close to a tautology (“for permitted work, there are COs”), but doesn’t confirm there were permits **when required** (or that the specific apartment has a CO).

**What to change:**
- Add a specific condition: **Seller must deliver final CO for the garage apartment** before closing.
- Add a broader rep: **all improvements requiring permits/COs have them** (including the shed), and this rep **survives closing** (or is a closing condition with escrow if not satisfied).

### C. Mortgage contingency

**What the draft does:**
- Mortgage contingency is “Intentionally Deleted.”

**Why that’s a problem for Bob:**
- If Bob can’t get a mortgage after reasonable efforts, he risks losing the deposit (seller keeps deposit as liquidated damages).

**What to change:**
- Add a **mortgage contingency**: amount, rate cap, term, application deadline, commitment deadline, “reasonable efforts,” and clear termination right with **deposit returned** if financing can’t be obtained.

### D. Shed has no permit: what remedy does the draft provide, and what to change?

**What the draft does:**
- ¶6 (title/municipal searches): Buyer can terminate if searches not “reasonably satisfactory” (but loses \$450 for contract prep).
- ¶10a: Seller can delay up to 30 days to “perfect title”; if still can’t, Buyer can accept or reject and get deposit back.

**What Bob wants (and should draft):**
- Make curing the shed permit issue a **closing condition** or a specific Seller covenant with a clear remedy:
  - Seller obtains permit by a deadline, or
  - Buyer can (i) delay closing without penalty, (ii) get an escrow/credit sized to handle the permit process, or (iii) terminate with deposit returned.

### E. Walk-through the day before closing + delay closing if issues found

**What the draft does:**
- No clear walk-through right tied to remedies.
- ¶7 (“as is”) + ¶15 (carrying costs for delayed closing) can pressure Buyer to close even if issues remain.

**What to change:**
- Add an express **final walk-through** right 24–48 hours before closing.
- If punch list items aren’t done or new material problems appear, Buyer may **adjourn closing** for cure **without triggering ¶15** carrying-cost penalties.
- For disputes, use **escrow + third-party determination** rather than “close now, sue later.”

## Key Takeaways

### 1. “Care + learn + control” predicts who pays
- Safety/function/legality → Seller more likely to pay.
- Aesthetics/idiosyncratic preferences → Buyer pays.

### 2. If you can’t investigate now, price can be contingent
- Use escrow/holdbacks tied to later testing (pool example).

### 3. Drafting is about remedies, not just promises
- A rep that doesn’t survive, without escrow, is often weak protection.

### Core Insight
> In deals, the most important “fact” you learn is sometimes the other side’s confidence (or lack of it), revealed through cooperation, consistency, and willingness to stand behind statements with real remedies.

## Notes for Class Discussion

- Be ready to defend the seller-cost allocation principle using “future buyers care + future buyers learn.”
- Be ready to distinguish: **DD (solves info asymmetry)** vs. **insurance (can create moral hazard)**.
- When proposing contract edits, always pair: **obligation + verification + remedy + survival/escrow**.
