# Key Concepts Overview

### 1. Three Core Problems in Contracts

According to Gilson & Baums, all contracts respond to three central problems:

1. **Uncertainty:** Future outcomes are unknown and unpredictable
2. **Information Asymmetry:** One party has more or better information than the other
3. **Agency Costs:** Conflicts of interest between decision-makers and stakeholders

---

## Question 1: Used Car Purchase Scenario

### A. What You Need to Know Before Purchasing

- Condition of the car (mechanical, cosmetic)
- Accident history
- Maintenance records
- Mileage
- Reason for selling
- Whether the price has been inspected independently

### B. Asymmetric Information - Definition

**Asymmetric information** occurs when one party to a transaction has more or better information than the other party. In used car sales, the seller knows the car's true condition, history, and problems, while the buyer cannot fully observe these qualities.

**Application to used cars:**

- Seller knows: hidden mechanical problems, past accidents, maintenance issues
- Buyer only sees: surface appearance, seller's statements (which may be dishonest)
- This creates the classic "lemons problem" (Akerlof) where bad quality cars drive out good quality cars from the market

### C. Can Asymmetric Information Prevent Transactions?

**Yes.** Even if the car is actually high quality, asymmetric information can prevent sales because:

- Buyers cannot distinguish good cars from bad cars
- Buyers will assume average quality and offer an average price
- Sellers of high-quality cars won't accept below-market prices and withdraw from market
- Only low-quality "lemons" remain, further reducing buyer willingness to pay
- This creates a **market failure** where mutually beneficial trades don't occur

### D. Asking Questions and Ensuring Honesty

**Improving honesty through contractual mechanisms:**

1. **Representations and Warranties:** Seller makes specific statements about the car that become contractual terms
2. **Disclosure Requirements:** Legal obligation to reveal known defects
3. **Indemnification:** Seller agrees to compensate buyer for any undisclosed problems
4. **Audit Rights:** Ability to verify claims after purchase
5. **Reps & Warranty Insurance:** Third-party guarantee (more relevant in larger deals)

**Why questions alone may be insufficient:**

- Seller may simply lie
- Even honest seller may forget or be unaware of issues
- Seller may have different understanding of terms (e.g., "runs well")

### E. Role of a Mechanic

**Yes, this helps significantly.** A mechanic:

- Provides independent verification of car's condition
- Reduces information asymmetry
- Can identify hidden problems buyer wouldn't notice
- Acts as a third-party expert who can be held liable for negligence

### F. Agency Costs - Definition

**Agency costs** arise when an agent (the mechanic) is supposed to act on behalf of a principal (the buyer), but the agent's interests may not align perfectly with the principal's interests.

**Mechanic as brother-in-law:**

- Mechanic owes loyalty to seller (family relationship)
- May downplay problems to help seller
- Buyer cannot rely on mechanic's objectivity
- This creates an agency problem - the agent's loyalty is divided

### G. Contingent Payment Structure

**Yes, this makes buyers more comfortable.** The contingent payment ($2,000 now + $3,000 later if car "runs well"):

- Shifts risk from buyer to seller
- Gives seller incentive to be honest about condition
- Aligns incentives - seller only gets full price if car performs well
- Reduces buyer's exposure to hidden defects

### H. Defining "Running Well"

**Crucially important.** Ambiguous terms create disputes. Better to define objectively:

- "No more than $X in repairs in first year"
- "Passes state inspection"
- "No mechanical breakdown requiring towing"
- Specific performance metrics

### I. Moral Hazard - Definition

**Moral hazard** occurs when one party takes risks or reduces effort because they don't bear the full consequences of their actions, and the other party cannot observe their behavior.

**How contingent payment affects buyer behavior:**

- Buyer might take worse care of car (less maintenance, harder driving)
- Buyer knows they won't pay full amount if car breaks
- Seller can't monitor how buyer treats car
- This is moral hazard - buyer's behavior changes because of the contract structure

**Solutions:**

- Require documented maintenance
- Base payment on objective condition standards rather than simple "running well"
- Include inspection provisions

### J. House Purchase Comparison

**Yes, similar asymmetric information exists:**

- Structural problems (foundation, roof)
- Flood/pest damage
- Neighborhood issues
- Zoning changes
- Outstanding liens

**Helpful steps (similar to car):**

- Professional inspection (home inspector)
- Seller disclosures (required by law in many states)
- Contingent payment (holdback in escrow for repairs)
- Title search (third-party verification)
- Survey

### K. Business Purchase

**Even more asymmetric information:**

- Financial records may be manipulated
- Customer relationships may be overstated
- Key employees may leave after sale
- Hidden liabilities (lawsuits, environmental issues)
- Future earning potential is uncertain

**Helpful mechanisms:**

- **Due diligence:** Thorough investigation of all business aspects
- **Representations and warranties:** Seller guarantees about business
- **Indemnification:** Seller agrees to cover losses from breaches
- **Earn-outs:** Contingent payments based on future performance
- **Employment agreements:** Key employees stay after sale
- **Non-compete agreements:** Seller doesn't start competing business

### L. Never Buy Anything Statement

**No, I disagree.** The statement is too extreme:

- Markets have evolved mechanisms to address information problems
- These mechanisms enable transactions despite asymmetry
- The costs of solving information problems are often worth the gains from trade
- Modern society functions because we've developed ways to trust strangers

### M. Universal Statement About Transactions

**Yes, I agree.** Every transaction involves some degree of:

- Information asymmetry (seller knows more)
- Incentive misalignment (parties want different things)
- Risk allocation (who bears uncertainty)

**The role of transactional lawyers is to design mechanisms to overcome these problems:**

- Due diligence reduces information asymmetry
- Contingent purchase price allocates risk appropriately
- Staged financing aligns incentives over time
- Third-party vouching provides credible guarantees
- Disclosure requirements force information sharing
- Covenants and restrictions control future behavior

### N. Lawyer's Role

**Yes, I agree completely.** Transactional lawyers are essentially information and incentive engineers. Their tools include:

| Tool                                   | Problem it Solves                    | Example                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Due Diligence**                | Information asymmetry                | Reviewing financial records before buying a business |
| **Contingent Purchase Price**    | Uncertainty + Information asymmetry  | Earnout based on future performance                  |
| **Staged Financing**             | Agency costs + Information asymmetry | VC funding released as milestones met                |
| **Representations & Warranties** | Information asymmetry                | Seller guarantees accuracy of statements             |
| **Indemnification**              | Information asymmetry                | Seller pays for breached warranties                  |
| **Third-Party Vouching**         | Information asymmetry + Agency costs | Audit letters, insurance, escrow agents              |

## Question 2: Online Clothing Returns

### A. Why Offer Money-Back Guarantee?

Despite the cost, returns policies exist because:

1. **Reduces buyer's information asymmetry:** Buyer can't try clothes before purchase
2. **Signals seller confidence:** Seller wouldn't offer returns if products were terrible
3. **Creates trust:** Essential for online transactions where you can't inspect goods
4. **Competitive necessity:** Other stores offer returns
5. **Increases sales:** More people buy when returns are easy
6. **Reputation building:** Good return policies build customer loyalty

### B. Accepting Stained Clothes

**No.** The function of the return guarantee is to allow the buyer to conduct **due diligence on the product** - not to **alter the product**.

**Key insight:** Solutions that go beyond the information asymmetry (by effectively providing insurance) create a **moral hazard problem**.

- Stains are buyer-caused, not product defects
- Return Policy addresses asymmetric information about fit/quality, not insurance for buyer behavior
- 
- If stores accepted stained returns, customers would be less careful (moral hazard)

### C. New Return Policy Analysis

**Will 10% extra charge fund the policy? NO - it will likely be insufficient.**

**Why?** Moral hazard!

- Before: People were careful because they bore the cost of stains
- After: People know they can return stained clothes, so they'll be less careful
- Result: MORE than 1 in 10 items will be stained (maybe 2-3 in 10)
- The policy changes behavior in a way that makes it more expensive

**This illustrates:**

- **Adverse selection:** People who expect to stain clothes will buy the policy
- **Moral hazard:** Insurance reduces incentives to be careful
- The premium must account for BOTH the base rate AND the behavior change

---

## Question 3: Outdoor Concerts and Rain

### A. Uncertainty vs. Asymmetric Information

**This is UNCERTAINTY, not asymmetric information.**

**Difference:**

- **Asymmetric information:** One party knows something the other doesn't (seller knows car has problems)
- **Uncertainty:** NO ONE knows what will happen (nobody knows if it will rain on concert day)

Both create problems for contracts, but:

- Asymmetric information can sometimes be solved by information sharing
- Uncertainty must be managed through risk allocation

### B. Who Should Bear Rain Risk?

**Consider each party's ability to:**

1. **Performer:**

   - Could perform elsewhere if rained out
   - Often gets paid regardless (contract may guarantee fee)
   - Less able to diversify risk (one event at a time)
2. **Ticket holders:**

   - Most risk-averse (small amounts matter more to them)
   - Least able to assess or control weather
   - Many individual losses vs. one large loss for organizer
   - **Economic argument:** They're the worst at bearing this risk
3. **Arena owner:**

   - Already bears risk of empty venue
   - May have insurance for weather events
   - Can spread risk across many events
   - **Cheaper for owner to bear risk:** Owner participates in the arena every night; on average they have a predictable number of rainy days per year and can plan for these using historical data and the law of large numbers
   - In contrast, a one-off concert-goer only attends a few events per year and can't easily predict or insure against bad weather on their specific night

**Best allocation:** Arena owner or organizer (who can insure and spread risk), not ticket holders

### C. Deciding Who Best Bears Risk

**Criteria for optimal risk allocation:**

1. **Risk tolerance:** Who can best absorb losses? (wealthy, diversified parties)
2. **Control:** Who can influence the outcome? (nobody controls weather)
3. **Information:** Who knows the risk best? (all parties have same weather info)
4. **Insurance:** Who can most cheaply insure against the risk?
5. **Diversification:** Who can spread this risk across many events?

**For weather risk:**

- Organizers/owners are best (insurable, diversified)
- Ticket holders are worst (not diversified, can't insure)

**For clothing returns:**

- Risk is moral hazard, not pure uncertainty
- Seller bears it because seller can:
  - Monitor for abuse
  - Price returns into products
  - Spread risk across many customers
  - Design policy to minimize abuse

---

## Question 4: Executive Stock Ownership (Autoco vs. Carco)

**Why the difference matters:**

**Autoco (executives own stock):**

- Executives' interests align with shareholders
- When executives make decisions, they benefit personally from stock price increases
- They bear costs of bad decisions through stock price declines
- **Lower agency costs** - incentives are aligned

**Carco (executives don't own stock):**

- Executives paid salaries/bonuses unrelated to company performance
- Executives might pursue personal benefits at company expense
- No direct financial consequence for bad stock performance
- **Higher agency costs** - incentives are misaligned

**This illustrates that equity compensation reduces agency costs by aligning interests.**

## Question 5: The Corporate Jet Agency Problem

**Scenario:** CEO wants $10M jet for $100K of personal benefit; business doesn't need it

### A. Shareholder Perspective and Influence

**Shareholders would NOT want the jet:**

- Cost: $10M to company
- Benefit: $100K to CEO
- Net loss to shareholders: $9.9M

**Shareholder influence over public company CEOs:**

- **Limited direct control:** Individual shareholders have minimal say
- **Board of Directors:** Supervises CEO, can block bad decisions
- **Executive compensation committee:** Can set policies
- **Shareholder votes:** Can vote out directors, but rarely effective
- **Market for corporate control:** Takeover threat can discipline management
- **Activist shareholders:** Can campaign for changes

**In practice:** CEOs often have significant autonomy; the jet might get approved

### B. CEO Without Stock - Agency Cost

**Is it personally beneficial to CEO? YES.**

- CEO gets $100K of personal benefit
- CEO bears $0 of the cost (company pays)
- Net gain to CEO: $100K

**This is a classic AGENCY COST:**

- CEO makes decisions that benefit themselves at the expense of shareholders
- CEO is an "agent" of shareholders (the "principals")
- Agent's interests conflict with principals' interests
- This is why corporate governance matters

### C. CEO With 2% Stock Ownership

**Cost-benefit analysis:**

- Cost to CEO personally: 2% × $10M = $200,000
- Benefit to CEO: $100,000
- **Net loss to CEO: $100,000**

**Is it beneficial? NO.**

- CEO would lose money personally
- Ownership aligns incentives - CEO now bears some cost of bad decisions

**Lesson:** Even relatively small ownership stakes can significantly change incentives

### D. Equity Compensation as Response to Agency Costs

**YES, equity compensation addresses agency costs by:**

1. **Aligning incentives:** Executives benefit when stock price rises
2. **Sharing consequences:** Executives bear costs when stock price falls
3. **Making executives think like owners:** Decisions affect personal wealth
4. **Reducing wasteful spending:** CEO won't buy jet if it costs them personally

**Forms of equity compensation:**

- Restricted stock
- Stock options
- Performance shares
- Stock appreciation rights

**Trade-off:** Too much equity creates other problems (excessive risk-taking, short-term focus)

---

## Question 6: Risky Investment Decision (The "Venture")

**Scenario:**

- Current stock price: $100
- Venture: 50% chance of $500, 50% chance of $0 (bankruptcy)
- CEO is well-respected, could easily find other jobs

### A. Stock Value to Risk-Neutral Investors

**Expected value calculation:**

- 50% × $500 + 50% × $0 = $250

**The stock would be worth $250 to risk-neutral investors.**

**Comparison to current value:**

- Current: $100
- With Venture: $250
- **Increase of $150 per share**

**From a purely financial perspective, Venture creates value.**

### B. Shareholder Losses in Bankruptcy

**What shareholders lose in bankruptcy:**

- They lose their entire investment in Bigco (stock becomes worthless)
- **BUT:** If they're diversified (Bigco is <5% of portfolio), this is manageable
- They can spread their investments across many companies
- One bankruptcy doesn't ruin them

**Would diversified shareholders want the Venture? YES.**

- Expected value increases by $150/share (50% gain)
- Diversified shareholders can tolerate the risk
- They want the CEO to take positive-NPV projects

### C. CEO Losses and Agency Cost

**What CEO loses in bankruptcy:**

- Job and salary
- Reputation (would be damaged by leading company to bankruptcy)
- **Specific human capital:** Career built at Bigco is now worth less
- Future employment prospects would suffer
- This is a **massive personal cost** to the CEO

**Is CEO more or less enthusiastic than shareholders? MUCH LESS.**

**Agency cost:**

- Shareholders: Diversified, can afford risk, want the $150/share gain
- CEO: Undiversified (career and reputation tied to Bigco), bears enormous personal cost
- CEO might reject a value-creating investment because it's too risky for them personally
- **This is an agency cost** - CEO's interests conflict with shareholders' interests

### D. Effect of Equity Compensation

**New compensation package:**

- Cash: $2.5M (reduced from $3M)
- Stock: 10,000 shares (worth $1M at current price)
- Total: Still $3.5M

**If Venture succeeds (stock = $500):**

- Stock worth: 10,000 × $500 = $50M
- Total compensation: $2.5M + $50M = $52.5M
- **Huge upside!**

**If Venture fails (stock = $0):**

- Stock worth: $0
- Total compensation: $2.5M (reduced by $1M)
- **CEO still loses, but now has massive upside potential**

**Does CEO prefer Venture now? YES, much more.**

**Equity compensation works because:**

- CEO participates in the upside
- CEO's interests now aligned with shareholders
- CEO is willing to take value-creating risks
- **Agency cost is reduced**

## Question 7: Executive Stock Options

**Scenario:**

- Stock price: $45 (when options granted)
- Options: 100,000 shares at $60 strike price
- S&P 500: $6,000 (when granted)
- Term: 10 years

### A. Stock Increases 10% to $66

**Options value:**

- Stock price: $66
- Strike price: $60
- Profit per share: $66 - $60 = $6
- Total: 100,000 × $6 = **$600,000**

### B. Shareholder Happiness with 10% Gain (S&P up 50%)

**Shareholders are likely UNHAPPY.**

**Why?**

- Company stock: +10% (to $66)
- Market (S&P 500): +50% (to $9,000)
- **Company underperformed market by 40 percentage points**
- $10,000 invested in S&P would be worth $15,000
- $10,000 invested in Company would be worth $11,000

The executive made $600K while delivering poor relative performance.

### C. Stock Price Still $60 After 10 Years

**Options value:**

- Stock price: $60
- Strike price: $60
- Profit per share: $0
- Total: **$0**

Options expire worthless because stock never exceeded strike price.

### D. Stock at $60 (S&P Down 50%)

**Shareholders are likely HAPPY.**

**Why?**

- Company stock: 0% change (at $60)
- Market (S&P 500): -50% (to $3,000)
- **Company outperformed market by 50 percentage points**
- Company preserved value while market crashed
- Relative performance was excellent

But executive gets $0 from options.

### E. Problems with Option Structure

**Problems with conventional options:**

1. **No penalty for underperformance:** Executive gets $0 whether stock stays flat, drops slightly, or crashes
2. **No relationship to market:** Options reward absolute stock price, not relative performance
3. **All-or-nothing:** Executive gets huge payoff if stock barely exceeds $60, even if market triples
4. **Encourages excessive risk:** Executive might take risky bets to get stock above $60
5. **Reward luck, not skill:** Bull market makes options valuable regardless of executive's skill

**Better approaches:**

- **Indexed options:** Strike price adjusted for market returns
- **Performance shares:** Award based on relative performance vs. peers
- **Restricted stock with holding requirements:** Executive owns stock long-term
- **Clawback provisions:** Can recover compensation if performance later proves poor

---

## Question 8: Indexed Options

**Scenario:**

- Stock price: $60 (when granted)
- S&P 500: $6,000 (when granted)
- Indexed strike: 1/100 of S&P value
- Options: 100,000 shares

**Normal strike at grant:** 1/100 × $6,000 = $60 (same as conventional)

### A. Stock +10% to $66 (S&P +50% to $9,000)

**Indexed strike price:**

- 1/100 × $9,000 = $90

**Options value:**

- Stock price: $66
- Strike price: $90
- **Options are underwater** - worth $0

**Is this appropriate? YES.**

- Executive underperformed market by 40 percentage points
- Executive shouldn't be rewarded for poor relative performance
- Indexed options properly align incentives

### B. Stock at $60 (S&P -50% to $3,000)

**Indexed strike price:**

- 1/100 × $3,000 = $30

**Options value:**

- Stock price: $60
- Strike price: $30
- Profit per share: $60 - $30 = $30
- Total: 100,000 × $30 = **$3,000,000**

**Is this appropriate? YES.**

- Executive outperformed market by 50 percentage points
- Executive preserved value in a down market
- Relative performance was excellent
- Executive is rewarded for doing well compared to market

### C. Conventional vs. Indexed Options

**As compensation committee chair, I would favor INDEXED OPTIONS.**

**Reasons:**

1. **Aligns incentives with shareholders:** Shareholders care about relative performance, not absolute stock price
2. **Rewards skill, not market luck:** Executive can't get rich just because market rises
3. **Penalizes underperformance:** Executive gets nothing for lagging the market
4. **Reduces excessive risk-taking:** No incentive to pump stock to $61 when market goes to $9,000
5. **Fairer to shareholders:** Pay reflects actual executive performance

**Why indexed options are NOT more common:**

- Accounting complexity (FASB rules)
- Executives dislike them (less upside in bull markets)
- Harder to explain to employees
- May not attract talent if competitors offer conventional options

**Conclusion:** Indexed options are better for aligning incentives and reducing agency costs, despite being less popular with executives.

## Key Takeaways for Class 1

### Three Core Problems:

1. **Information Asymmetry** - One party knows more than the other
2. **Agency Costs** - Decision-makers' interests conflict with stakeholders
3. **Uncertainty** - No one knows what will happen

### Lawyer's Tools to Address These Problems:

| Problem               | Legal Solutions                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Information Asymmetry | Due diligence, representations & warranties, disclosure requirements, third-party verification, escrow, earn-outs   |
| Agency Costs          | Equity compensation, clawbacks, restrictive covenants, board oversight, performance-based pay, indexed compensation |
| Uncertainty           | Insurance, contingent payments, risk allocation provisions, force majeure clauses, options to terminate             |

### Core Insight:

> Every transaction involves problems of information and incentives that can discourage parties from entering into value-maximizing arrangements. Transactional lawyers design contractual mechanisms to overcome these problems and enable mutually beneficial exchange.

---

## Notes for Class Discussion:

- **Be prepared to define the three core problems clearly**
- **Think of real-world examples beyond those in the questions**
- **Consider how these concepts apply to different types of deals**
- **Think about why some solutions work better than others**
- **Consider the trade-offs involved in different contractual approaches**
