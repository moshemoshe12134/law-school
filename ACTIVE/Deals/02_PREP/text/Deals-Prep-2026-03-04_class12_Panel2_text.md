**Course:** Deals  
**Topic:** Disclosure as a response to information + incentive problems; when disclosure is credible; what mandatory disclosure adds  
**Date:** 2026-04-08

## Key Concepts Overview

This class is disclosure as a tool for information asymmetry, plus the hard part: credibility.

Core frame:
- **Asymmetric information:** the issuer/manager knows more than outsiders.
- **Disclosure:** can narrow the gap, but only if outsiders can trust it.
- **Credibility mechanisms (substitutes/complements for mandatory disclosure):**
  - **Anti-fraud liability** (raising the cost of lying)
  - **Verification / vouching** (accountants, auditors, bankers, experts)
  - **Skin in the game** (equity stakes, warranties, bonding)
  - **Reputation / repeat play** (future financing, donors, board oversight)
  - **Standardization** (common definitions/format enabling comparisons)

Easterbrook & Fischel’s move: treat anti-fraud and disclosure rules as ways to reduce wasteful verification and improve capital allocation, but recognize enforcement error and administrative costs.

---

## Question 1: E&F — Why fraud is inefficient

E&F: fraud undermines allocative efficiency because it forces wasteful, duplicative verification and still leaves underinvestment/misallocation.

- Fraud/information unreliability makes investors:
  - spend money verifying (duplication across many investors),
  - underinvest in good ventures (can’t distinguish quality),
  - overinvest in lemons (pooling at “average” quality).
- Key point: the **lowest-cost provider of information** is often the issuer/insider, not dispersed investors. A legal rule can shift burdens toward the lower-cost producer.

---

## Question 2: Disclosure without an anti-fraud rule (assume fraud is legal)

### 2a. Does Competentco (CC) have incentive to disclose? Is it trustworthy?

**YES** — CC wants to separate from lemons.  
**Trustworthiness is the problem** — CC benefits from being believed, but investors know low-quality firms can mimic.

Credibility gap:
- CC can disclose verifiable facts, but much of what matters is forward-looking/soft and hard to verify.
- If fraud is legal, the market discounts disclosures more aggressively.

### 2b. Does Ineptco (IC) disclose accurate information?

**NO (in general).** IC’s incentive is to pool with CC.
- If IC tells the truth, it reveals it is low quality and gets priced accordingly.
- IC prefers “cheap talk” that mimics CC.

### 2c. How can CC reassure investors even without a law ban on fraud?

Costly signaling / bonding:
- **Third-party certification** (reputable auditor, underwriter, rating agency) if their reputation is on the line.
- **Contractual bonding** (warranties/indemnities/escrow equivalents in securities are limited, but analogs exist: lockups, covenants, disclosure covenants, audited statements).
- **Skin in the game** (managers hold equity/undiversified stake; dividend policy; debt covenants).

### 2d. Can investors still distinguish CC vs IC?

**Sometimes YES**, but imperfectly.
- Investors look for costly signals IC can’t cheaply mimic.
- Reputational intermediaries can help, but create their own agency costs.

### 2e. Why is convincing investors still limited?

Two limits:
- **You can’t disclose everything** (proprietary info; volume; bandwidth).
- **Investors don’t want to verify everything** (verification is expensive; collective action/free-riding).

### 2f. Role of bankers and accountants (review)

They are **repeat players** who can “rent out” reputation.
- They reduce verification costs by producing a credible signal.
- They also create **agency costs** (conflicts; incentives to please the client).

### 2g. Role of incentive comp; can nonprofits use it? (review)

Incentive comp can align insiders with outsiders by creating **skin in the game**.
- In for-profits, equity-based incentives can be powerful (but can distort risk-taking).
- Nonprofits can use incentives, but can’t replicate residual-claim equity in the same way; they rely more on mission, governance, reputational discipline, and constrained KPI-style incentives.

---

## Question 3: Anti-fraud rule (no mandatory disclosure)

### 3a. Without an anti-fraud rule, is all information unreliable?

**NO.** Markets can generate partial credibility via reputation, intermediaries, and repeat dealing. Reliability is weaker and more expensive.

### 3b. How does a ban on fraud help?

It raises the expected cost of lying and makes truthful statements more credible.
- It reduces the need for costly verification.
- It helps high-quality issuers separate at lower cost.

### 3c. Why doesn’t anti-fraud eliminate signaling/certification costs?

Because:
- **Underenforcement** is possible (detection/proof problems).
- Many “lies” are hard to classify (opinions, projections).
- Silence still exists and can be strategically ambiguous.

### 3d. What costs does the anti-fraud rule introduce?

- Enforcement and compliance costs.
- Error costs: overenforcement/under-enforcement and chilling effects (firms say less to avoid liability).
- Litigation/settlement costs and strategic suits.

---

## Question 4: What mandatory disclosure adds (beyond anti-fraud)

### 4a. Can a firm remain silent under both regimes?

- Under **anti-fraud only**, silence is generally permissible (subject to specific duties to correct/avoid misleading half-truths).
- Under **mandatory disclosure**, silence is narrower: required periodic and event-driven disclosures.

### 4b. Is information a public good? So what?

**Often YES.** Information has spillovers:
- once produced, others can use it at low marginal cost,
- producers may underinvest because they can’t capture full benefits.

This supports a case for some mandated disclosure, but it doesn’t prove the scope should be large.

### 4c. Why too little? Why too much?

Too little:
- firms don’t capture full social benefits,
- investors free-ride on others’ verification.

Too much:
- disclosure can aid competitors,
- compliance can be costly,
- noisy/low-value disclosures can swamp the signal.

### 4d. Without mandatory disclosure, disclose good news?

**YES.** Good news helps price and lowers cost of capital.

### 4e. Why hesitate to disclose bad news?

Bad news raises cost of capital, can trigger covenants/exit, invites scrutiny, and may help competitors.

### 4f. If a firm always discloses good news, what does silence mean?

Silence becomes a negative signal: investors infer “no news” is probably bad news.

### 4g. Given 4f, does the firm have reason to disclose bad news?

**YES (sometimes).** If silence is read as bad, disclosure can control the narrative and reduce uncertainty.

---

## Question 5: Standardization + “network effects”

### 5a. What is a network effect?

**Network effect:** the value of a system increases as more users adopt the same standard (shared “language” makes participation more valuable).

### 5b. Do common formats/definitions create network effects? Justify mandatory disclosure?

**YES.** Standardized disclosure:
- makes cross-firm comparisons cheaper,
- improves the “disclosure language,”
- reduces gamesmanship from idiosyncratic metrics.

### 5c. What’s the risk with government-mandated format/definitions?

- One-size-fits-all can misfit business models.
- Standards can become stale and lock in bad metrics.
- Firms optimize to the metric (Goodhart’s Law), not to substance.

---

## Question 6: Nonprofit initiative goes poorly; what to tell donor Diane

### 6a. “Bold and illuminating … couldn’t have done it without you”

**Probably NO legal liability** as stated; it reads as puffery/thanks, not a verifiable factual claim.
But there’s reputational risk if it’s used to imply success when it failed.

### 6b. False statement: “same effectiveness for half the cost”

**YES, real liability risk.**
- It’s a concrete factual claim likely to be material to donors.
- Even if securities-law style rules don’t apply, general fraud/misrepresentation theories and donor agreements can.

### 6c. Reasons to tell the truth (principle + self-interest)

Principle:
- Duty to be honest with those financing mission work.

Self-interest:
- Reputation with donors/board.
- Future fundraising.
- Internal governance (truth is input for learning, avoiding repeat mistakes).

### 6d. Why shade the truth?

- Career incentives (Adrian vs Bob internal rivalry; “protect the brand”).
- Fear of donor exit and board backlash.
- Desire to preserve discretion/avoid oversight.

### 6e. Why might CFO Charlotte blow the whistle (two reasons)?

- **Fiduciary/governance concern:** prevent misuse of donor trust and future liability.
- **Self-protection:** avoid being implicated; preserve reputation; reduce personal career risk.

### 6f. Even if tempted, reasons not to mislead?

**YES.**
- Misleading disclosure undermines future trust and fundraising.
- Internal learning collapses if reporting is not accurate.
- A credible nonprofit needs durable reputational capital.

### 6g. Expert opinion from Professor Ellen: why add value? why not?

Adds value:
- Third-party credibility; perceived independence; improved methodology.
- Can signal seriousness (willingness to be evaluated).

May not add value:
- Expert may lack data access or be captured.
- “Expert” label can become cheap talk if not truly independent or if methods are weak.

## Question 7: Opera ticket sales (A sells out; B half unsold)

### 7a. Release A? Release B?

**Release A: YES** — it’s good news and marketing.  
**Release B: Frank is less enthusiastic** — bad news.

### 7b. Problem with releasing A but not B

Selective disclosure creates an inference:
- Silence about B becomes a negative signal.
- Outsiders assume the unreleased numbers are bad.

### 7c. Case for never vs always releasing

Never:
- Avoids selective disclosure inference games.
- Avoids pressure to optimize optics over art.

Always:
- Credibility via consistency.
- Lets board/donors evaluate strategy with comparable data over time.

## Question 8: University pivot to climate; disclosure to donors and public

### 8a. Strategy memo: Kim (classics major donor)

Pros:
- Transparency; respects stakeholder autonomy; reduces rumor.
- Can attract aligned donors.

Cons:
- Alienates donor segments.
- Creates lobbying/pressure; constrains future flexibility.

### 8b. Year-one results online (enrollment shifts, cuts)

Pros:
- Accountability; credibility; internal motivation via measurement.

Cons:
- Metrics can be misleading and politicized.
- Incentives to manage the metric rather than the mission.

### 8c–8e. Can Len / Mary / rating agency get info privately?

- **Len (major donor): YES** — access and bargaining power.
- **Mary (small donor): usually NO** — collective action problem; limited access.
- **Rating agency: often YES** — can gather from public sources and institutional channels; but still depends on what the institution will share.

### 8f. Post Len’s report publicly?

Pros:
- Standardization; credibility; reduces information asymmetry broadly.

Cons:
- Competitive/political costs; creates pressure to curate narrative; can be misunderstood out of context.

---

## Question 9: Form 990

### 9a–9b. What it requires

**YES** — compensation, governance policies, conflicts, and financial statement-type information.  

### 9c. Does it require cost-effectiveness / impact?

**Generally NO** — it’s weak on outcome/impact measurement.

---

## Question 10: Overhead ratios

### 10a. What are they?

**Overhead ratio:** the share of spending on admin/fundraising vs program services.

### 10b–10c. Why used? case for relying

Used because they’re available and comparable-ish (Form 990 inputs).
Case for:
- crude screen against obvious waste/self-dealing,
- helps donors who can’t do deep diligence.

### 10d. Case against

- Bad proxy for impact; good management costs money.
- Easy to game via classification choices.
- Encourages underinvestment in infrastructure and measurement.

---

## Question 11: Penelope job training nonprofit; donor wants satisfaction survey

### 11a. Should Penelope agree?

**NO (as drafted).** She should push for metrics tied to outcomes and learning value.
- Satisfaction surveys are often output-adjacent and can be noisy.
- If done, keep them lightweight and pair with outcome measures.

### 11b. As foundation board member: agree with Quincy’s insistence?

**Mostly NO.**
- Strongest argument for Quincy: standardization enables comparisons across grantees (network-effect logic).
- Strongest argument against: it imposes measurement that may be low-value for this program and diverts resources.

Best compromise:
- Require a small common core (comparability) plus a tailored outcome metric (program relevance).

---

## Key Takeaways

- Anti-fraud rules can substitute for expensive verification, but enforcement error is a real cost.
- Mandatory disclosure’s best argument is standardization and comparability (network effects), not “firms would otherwise say nothing.”
- Selective disclosure creates inference games; consistency is part of credibility.
- In nonprofits, weak impact disclosure plus reliance on overhead ratios creates a predictable distortion.

---

## Notes for Class Discussion

- Have a clean definition of **network effects** ready with one concrete example.
- For any disclosure question: ask “credible compared to what alternative,” and list the bonding mechanisms.
- For nonprofits: distinguish **output** metrics (easy) from **outcome/impact** metrics (hard, but closer to mission).
