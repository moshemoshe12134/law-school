# Class 6 Prep Sheet: Spinoffs - Cooperation to Claim Tax Losses

**Course:** Deals
**Topic:** Spinoffs, Tax Attributes, and NOL Carrybacks under the CARES Act
**Date:** Spring Semester 2026

---

## Key Concepts Overview

This class focuses on **Net Operating Losses (NOLs)**, the **CARES Act's temporary carryback provisions**, and how spinoffs create complex cooperation problems around valuable tax attributes.

Key themes include:
- **Value of tax deductions** - depends on the taxpayer's marginal tax rate
- **NOLs** - losses that can offset taxable income in other years
- **Carrybacks vs. carryforwards** - timing of when losses can be used
- **CARES Act** - temporarily restored 5-year carryback for 2018-2020 losses
- **Spinoffs** - creating separate companies from a parent's subsidiaries
- **Tax matters agreements** - allocating tax attributes between spun-off companies
- **Cooperation problems** - when one company needs another's tax history to claim benefits

**The core insight:** Tax law doesn't operate in isolation. Corporate transactions like spinoffs create complex interdependencies around valuable tax attributes. Companies must negotiate who gets the benefit of tax attributes that predate the separation, and cooperation can create value for both parties.

## Question 1: The economic value of a tax deduction is the amount of tax it allows you to avoid.

### A. Is the ability to deduct $1 of expense worth $1?

**Answer:** No, a $1 deduction is worth less than $1 because a deduction reduces taxable income, not tax liability directly.

**For example:** If you earn $100 and the tax rate is 21%, without the deduction your tax would be $100 times 21%, or $21. With the $1 deduction, your taxable income becomes $99, so your tax is $99 times 21%, or $20.79. Therefore, the value of a $1 deduction is only $0.21, which is the tax savings.

### B. Assume that a corporation's tax rate is 21%. If the corporation earns $1, how much tax must the corporation pay?

**Answer:** If the corporation earns $1 and the tax rate is 21%, the corporation must pay $0.21 in taxes, calculated as $1 times 21%.

### C. Assume now that the corporation is able to deduct a $1 expense. How much tax does the corporation avoid? What is the economic value of this $1 deduction?

**Answer:** The corporation avoids $0.21 in tax, and the economic value of this $1 deduction is $0.21.

Here's why: Without the deduction, tax on $1 of income would be $0.21. With the deduction, taxable income becomes zero, so no tax is owed. The key insight is that the value of a deduction equals the deduction amount multiplied by the taxpayer's marginal tax rate.

### D. Please fill in the blank: The economic value of a deduction depends on a taxpayer's [MARGINAL TAX RATE].

**Answer:** The economic value of a deduction depends on a taxpayer's marginal tax rate.

**Explanation:** A higher tax rate means a more valuable deduction, while a lower tax rate means a less valuable deduction. This is why companies want to use deductions when tax rates are high.

## Question 2: In response to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the U.S. Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. One of its provisions enabled taxpayers to "carry back" net operating losses ("NOLs"). As background, let's cover a few basics of how NOLs are taxed in the U.S.

### A. Assume that Corporation (a U.S. taxpayer) has $9 million of revenue in 2020 and $10 million of expenses. Do you expect Corporation to pay any tax in 2020?

**Answer:** No, Corporation will not pay tax in 2020 because it has a net operating loss of $1 million rather than taxable income. The net operating loss is calculated as $10 million in expenses minus $9 million in revenue. Since there is no taxable income, no tax is owed.

### B. How is its "net operating loss" ("NOL") of $1 million treated? The U.S. corporate tax rate is 21%. Do you expect the NOL to generate a $210,000 tax refund in 2020?

**Answer:** No, I would not expect the NOL to generate a $210,000 tax refund in 2020 under normal rules before the CARES Act.

The reason is that NOLs can generally only be carried forward to offset future income, not carried back to generate immediate refunds. The corporation must wait until it has future taxable income to use the NOL. The $210,000 figure, calculated as $1 million loss times the 21% tax rate, represents the tax savings if and when the NOL is eventually used against future income, but it is not an immediate refund.

### C. Starting in 2018, U.S. corporations with NOLs could only "carry forward" tax losses. "Carrybacks" were no longer allowed. What is the difference between a carryforward and a carryback?

**Answer:** The difference is that a carryforward applies the loss to future years' income, meaning the company must wait to benefit, whereas a carryback applies the loss to past years' income, allowing the company to get a tax refund now.

Under typical rules before 2018, carrybacks could go back two years, generating immediate cash, while carryforwards can be used for 20 years or indefinitely under post-2017 law. For example, a $1 million loss in 2020 could be carried forward to offset income in 2021 or 2022 for delayed benefit, or carried back to offset 2018 or 2019 income for an immediate refund.

### D. In the above example, Corporation generates a $1 million net operating loss in 2020. Assume that Corporation had more than $1 million of net income in 2019, and expects to have more than $1 million of net income in 2021. If only carryforwards are allowed, in which year would Corporation deduct its NOL? What if carrybacks are allowed?

**Answer:** If only carryforwards are allowed, Corporation would deduct the NOL in 2021 or whenever future income occurs, which means it must wait to benefit. If carrybacks are allowed, Corporation would deduct against 2019 income and get an immediate refund. The key advantage of a carryback is immediate cash.

## Question 3: In the CARES Act, Congress authorized taxpayers once again to carry back losses (as they used to be able to do before 2018), but only losses generated in three years: 2018, 2019, and 2020. Assume that Businessco had $5 million of taxable income in 2017, $5 million of taxable income in 2018, and $2 million of NOLs in 2019. Because of the pandemic, Businessco expects to have more losses in 2020.

### A. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: "The CARES Act allows Businessco to get a tax refund for its 2019 NOL -- and thus to access more cash -- sooner than it otherwise would." In light of your answer, what policy do you think Congress was pursuing?

**Answer:** I agree with this statement because carrybacks allow losses to be applied to prior profitable years, which generates immediate tax refunds.

Without carryback, businesses would wait years to benefit from NOLs, but during the pandemic, immediate cash is critical. The policy Congress was pursuing is economic stimulus to get cash to struggling businesses quickly, help them survive pandemic shutdowns, and stimulate the economy by providing liquidity through retroactive relief for 2018, 2019, and 2020 losses.

### B. The U.S. corporate tax rate was 35% in 2017 (and in years before then), and this tax rate was reduced to 21% in 2018. What was the value of a $1 tax deduction in 2017? What about in 2018? In which year would you prefer to take a deduction?

**Answer:** The value of a $1 tax deduction in 2017 was $0.35, while in 2018 it was only $0.21. I would prefer to take the deduction in 2017 because a higher tax rate means a more valuable deduction.

This creates an incentive to carry back losses to pre-2018 years. The CARES Act creates a huge benefit because 2018, 2019, and 2020 losses can be carried back five years, including to 2017 and earlier when the tax rate was 35%, so companies get bigger refunds by carrying back to high-tax years.

### C. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: "Through the CARES Act, the U.S. government used the tax system to get cash in the hands of corporations by making tax refunds more generous."

**Answer:** I agree with this statement for four key reasons.

First, the CARES Act restored carrybacks that had been previously eliminated. Second, it provided a five-year carryback period, which is longer than the old two-year rule. Third, the carryback years had higher tax rates—35% in 2017 and earlier versus 21% now. Fourth, it provided immediate refunds, which was critical timing for pandemic relief.

The policy logic is that the government used the tax code as a stimulus tool to make refunds more generous than normal NOL rules, so businesses get bigger refunds sooner to help with cash flow during the crisis.

For example, a $1 million loss in 2019 carried back to 2017 at 35% generates a $350,000 refund, compared to carrying it forward to 2021 at 21%, which only provides $210,000 in future savings. The CARES Act effectively provides $140,000 in extra benefit plus immediate cash.

## Question 4: Hotelco, a publicly-traded U.S. company, owns a chain of U.S. hotels catering to business travelers. In the 1990s, Hotelco branched out, opening a number of theme parks and casinos throughout the U.S.. In 2017, Hotelco hired a new CEO, Carla, who decided that casinos and theme parks are very different from hotels, so they should not be operated together. So she put all of Hotelco's theme parks and casinos into a subsidiary, and on January 1, 2018, Hotelco "spun off" this subsidiary, "Recreationco," to Hotelco's shareholders as an independent publicly-traded company.

### A. What is a "Spin Off"?

**Answer:** A spinoff is a corporate transaction where a company creates a new independent company from one of its subsidiaries and distributes the shares to existing shareholders.

The key characteristics are: first, the parent company separates a business unit into a new entity; second, shares of the new company are distributed to the parent's shareholders; third, shareholders end up with stock in both companies; fourth, it's typically tax-free if structured properly; and fifth, it creates two independent public companies from one.

Companies do spinoffs to unlock value because the market may value businesses separately more than together, to focus on their core business, or for strategic reasons where different businesses need different management.

### B. What Happens to Shareholder's Stock?

**Answer:** Before the spinoff, a shareholder owns one share of Hotelco. After the spinoff, the shareholder still owns her one share of Hotelco—it wasn't taken away—and she also receives new shares of Recreationco, so she ends up with stock in both companies.

For example, if a shareholder owned 100 shares of Hotelco before the spinoff, afterward she would own 100 shares of Hotelco plus, say, 20 shares of Recreationco, with the ratio depending on the specific deal. This is typically tax-free to shareholders with no immediate tax consequence, as the shareholder's total investment is simply split between the two companies.

## Question 5: Continuing with the facts of the prior problem, assume that Hotelco used to be very profitable, but the company had very large losses in 2018 and 2019. Hotelco had the following income history (in years before the spinoff):

### A. Under the CARES Act, Hotelco can carry back losses five years (e.g., from 2018 to 2013). If it does not have enough income to use those losses, it can carry the remainder back four years (from 2018 to 2014), and then three years (to 2015), and then two years (to 2016), and then one year (to 2017). Assuming that Hotelco carries back its $200 million loss from 2018, in what years does it deduct it?

**Answer:** Hotelco deducts the loss in 2013 and 2014, using all $200 million.

Here's how the carryback works: Hotelco had $100 million profit in each year from 2013 through 2017, then a $200 million loss in 2018. First, Hotelco carries back to 2013, which offsets the entire $100 million income and leaves $100 million of loss remaining. Then Hotelco carries back to 2014, which offsets the entire $100 million income there as well, bringing the remaining loss to zero.

The tax benefit is substantial: $100 million times the 35% tax rate in 2013 equals a $35 million refund, and another $100 million times 35% in 2014 equals another $35 million refund, for a total of $70 million refunded.

### B. In what years would Hotelco use its $50 million loss from 2019?

**Answer:** Hotelco would deduct the 2019 loss in 2015, using $50 million of the $100 million income from that year.

The reason is that the 2013 and 2014 income was already fully used by the 2018 loss, so those years are no longer available. Years 2015, 2016, and 2017 still have their full $100 million of available income. The $50 million loss from 2019 would therefore be applied to 2015, generating a tax benefit of $50 million times 35%, or $17.5 million refunded.

### C. The CARES Act allows a company to waive its right to carryback losses, and to carry them forward instead. You are Hotelco's tax advisor. Should Hotelco carry back its 2018 and 2019 losses to earlier years? Why or why not?

**Answer:** Yes, Hotelco should carry back the losses, for several compelling reasons.

First, the tax rate is higher in the carryback years—35% versus 21%—which means a bigger refund. Specifically, the $200 million loss from 2018 generates $70 million in refunds at 35%, and the $50 million loss from 2019 generates $17.5 million in refunds at 35%. Second, the time value of money means cash now is worth more than cash later. Third, Hotelco is facing financial distress during the pandemic and needs liquidity. Fourth, there's no reason to wait when future income is uncertain.

### D. If Hotelco has $100 million of losses in 2020, could it carry all of that back?

**Answer:** Yes, assuming there's enough past income to absorb it. In this case, Hotelco has $250 million of total available income remaining: $50 million remaining from 2015 after the 2019 loss, plus the full $100 million each from 2016 and 2017. The $100 million loss in 2020 can be fully absorbed by using the remaining $50 million from 2015 and $50 million from 2016.

### E. What if Hotelco has $300 million of losses in 2020. Could it carry all of these losses back?

**Answer:** No, only $250 million can be carried back, and the remaining $50 million must be carried forward.

The reason is that only $250 million of income remains available from prior years: $50 million remaining from 2015, $100 million from 2016, and $100 million from 2017. Since the loss exceeds the available income, the excess $50 million cannot be carried back and must instead be carried forward to future tax years.

## Question 6: Continuing with the same facts, business has not been good for Recreationco either since the spin. Recreationco lost $50 million in both 2018 and 2019. Recreationco also expects losses in 2020 because its theme parks and casinos all had to close in mid-March because of the pandemic.

### A. Do you think Recreationco would want to carry back its 2018 and 2019 losses back to earlier years? Why or why not?

**Answer:** Recreationco would want to carry back its losses for the same reasons as Hotelco—higher tax rate and immediate cash—but there's a critical problem.

Recreationco has $100 million in total losses from 2018 and 2019, which at 35% would generate a potential $35 million refund. However, Recreationco didn't exist before 2018 because it was part of Hotelco. It has no tax history before the spinoff and no past income to offset losses against, which means Recreationco cannot carry back losses on its own.

### B. Before January 1, 2018, Recreationco was wholly owned by Hotelco. As a result, for the tax years before 2018, Recreationco did not file its own tax return. Instead, as part of Hotelco, its results were reflected in Hotelco's tax return. Compared with Hotelco, is it easier or harder for Recreationco to carry back losses?

**Answer:** It is much harder for Recreationco to carry back losses than for Hotelco.

Hotelco has a long tax history with profitable years and can easily carry back losses to those years in a straightforward process. By contrast, Recreationco has no tax history before 2018 because its results were part of Hotelco's tax returns before the spinoff. Recreationco cannot file amended returns for years when it didn't exist as a separate taxpayer, so it cannot carry back losses on its own. This creates a major disadvantage for spun-off companies with losses.

### C. Do you know whether the CARES Act provides Recreationco with a way to carry back its losses to the years before the spin off?

**Answer:** Yes, the CARES Act does provide a way, but it requires cooperation with Hotelco.

Recreationco can carry losses back to the years before the spinoff, but it must do so through Hotelco's tax returns. Recreationco needs Hotelco to amend its pre-2018 returns, which requires both companies to work together. Before 2018, Recreationco was part of Hotelco, and Hotelco filed consolidated tax returns that included Recreationco's results. To carry back losses, Hotelco must amend those returns, and any refund would go to Hotelco as the taxpayer, so Recreationco needs an agreement to get the benefit.

The key insight is that spinoffs create interdependence, where the spun-off company needs the parent's cooperation to access pre-spinoff tax benefits.

---

## Question 7: In a spinoff, two businesses that have been affiliated -- and thus have filed a single tax return together -- become independent businesses, which each file their own return. To prepare for the spinoff, these businesses have to come to an agreement, usually called a "tax matters agreement," about how they will handle this transition. The following are relevant portions of the tax matters agreement for the spinoff of Recreationco.

### A. What financial benefit would there be for Recreationco to carry back its $100 million of losses (from 2018 and 2019) to 2017 or earlier? What is the financial value of this benefit?

**Answer:** The financial benefit is $35 million, calculated as $100 million of total losses multiplied by the 35% tax rate from the profitable years of 2013 through 2017.

This is valuable because it provides immediate cash during the crisis, the higher tax rate means a bigger benefit, and Recreationco desperately needs liquidity.

### B. If Recreationco wants to carry back these losses, does the tax matters agreement give it the ability to do so? What (if anything) can Recreationco do to tap this financial benefit?

**Answer:** No, the tax matters agreement prohibits Recreationco from carrying back losses.

Section 1.02 explicitly states that Recreationco shall not carry back any U.S. federal income tax item to 2017 or an earlier tax year. Additionally, Section 1.03 provides that any refund received by Hotelco or Recreationco with respect to a Hotelco return shall be the property of Hotelco, regardless of whether the refund is attributable to Recreationco's credits or deductions.

Recreationco has three options. First, it could renegotiate the tax matters agreement with Hotelco's consent. Second, it could ask Hotelco to voluntarily amend its returns under Section 1.01, but any refund would go to Hotelco under Section 1.03, so a separate side letter agreement would be needed to share the refund. Third, Recreationco could waive the carryback and use losses for future years at the lower 21% rate, which provides less value but still some benefit. The key point is that Recreationco cannot act alone and needs Hotelco's cooperation.

### C. Under the tax matters agreement, which company has more leverage in any negotiation?

**Answer:** Hotelco has more leverage for several reasons.

First, Hotelco controls the amendable returns because Section 1.01 gives Hotelco the exclusive right to amend pre-2018 returns, which Recreationco cannot amend itself. Second, Hotelco keeps the refunds under Section 1.03, even if they're attributable to Recreationco's deductions. Third, Section 1.02 explicitly prohibits Recreationco from carrying back losses, so Recreationco needs Hotelco to change this. Fourth, Hotelco has its own losses of $250 million from 2018 and 2019 and may want to preserve its own capacity to carry back since there's a limitation on how much past income can be used.

That said, Recreationco does have some leverage. It could threaten to withhold cooperation on other matters, it might have claims if the tax matters agreement is unfair, and both companies can benefit from a deal—this is a cooperative opportunity.

### D. Richard, the CEO of Recreationco, asks Carla, the CEO of Holdco, to help Recreationco carry back its losses. You are Carla's mentor, and she calls to ask you for advice. Should she agree? What should she ask for in return?

**Answer:** Carla might agree for several reasons: it helps the Recreationco that Hotelco spun off, maintains a good business relationship between companies that may need to work together, it's fair given that Recreationco's losses contributed to Hotelco's pre-spinoff success, and being reasonable creates goodwill.

However, there are significant risks and concerns. Hotelco has $250 million of its own losses to carry back, there's only $500 million of total past income from 2013 through 2017, amending returns creates IRS audit risk, 2020 losses are unknown and could be significant, and Congress might change the rules again with legislative risk.

Carla should ask for several things in return. First, financial consideration—perhaps a 20 to 30% fee, so if Recreationco gets $35 million, Hotelco keeps $7 to $10 million as compensation for using its tax attributes and taking on risk. Second, Recreationco should indemnify Hotelco for any IRS challenges, meaning if the IRS disallows the losses, Recreationco bears the cost. Third, Hotelco's own losses from 2018, 2019, and 2020 should get priority, so Recreationco only uses any remaining capacity. Fourth, Recreationco should bear all audit risk and pay all legal and accounting fees, with Hotelco held harmless. Fifth, if Congress changes the law to reduce benefits, Recreationco should bear that risk or there should be a renegotiation clause.

As an example deal structure, Hotelco could agree to carry back $100 million of Recreationco's losses, generating a $35 million refund. Recreationco would get $25 to $30 million, Hotelco would keep $5 to $10 million as a fee or risk premium, Recreationco would indemnify Hotelco for all risks, and Hotelco's own losses would get priority. The key insight is that this is a classic cooperation problem where both parties can benefit, but they need to allocate risks and rewards fairly.

## Question 8: Grace is the general counsel of Hotelco. Carla calls Grace and says, "We're thinking about partnering with Recreationco to carry back their losses. If we do this, I want to be protected from all risks. Can you please identify the relevant risks and figure out how to protect us?" You are Hotelco's outside counsel, and Grace calls you with the following questions:

### A. Recreationco has $100 million of losses from 2018 and 2019. To carry back this amount, which company is going to file for this refund -- Recreationco or Hotelco? Assume that Recreationco's tax return for 2018 and 2019 has not been audited yet, so it's possible that the I.R.S. (the tax authority in the U.S.) will challenge parts of it. Does this possibility create a risk for Hotelco? If so, what should Hotelco do?

**Answer:** Hotelco is the company that will file for the refund because only Hotelco can amend pre-2018 returns under Section 1.01 of the tax matters agreement. Those were Hotelco's tax returns, and Recreationco didn't exist as a separate taxpayer.

Yes, this creates significant audit risk for Hotelco for several reasons. First, amending a return draws IRS attention and the IRS may examine the entire return, not just the NOL carryback, and could challenge other items. Second, the IRS might challenge Recreationco's loss calculations for 2018 and 2019, questioning whether expenses were properly documented or whether allocations between Hotelco and Recreationco were reasonable. Third, the pre-2018 returns were closed because the audit period had expired, but amending them reopens the returns, so Hotelco loses the protection of the statute of limitations. Fourth, if the IRS disallows part of the carryback, Hotelco might owe interest and penalties, which could be significant.

To protect itself, Hotelco should take several steps. First, it should get indemnification from Recreationco, meaning Recreationco agrees to reimburse Hotelco for any additional tax, interest, or penalties, and pays all legal and accounting costs. Second, Hotelco should conduct careful due diligence by reviewing Recreationco's tax returns for 2018 and 2019 to verify losses are properly calculated and adequately documented. Third, Hotelco could use an escrow or holdback arrangement where Recreationco doesn't get the full refund immediately, with a portion held back to cover potential IRS adjustments and released after the audit period passes. Fourth, there should be a limitation on liability to cap Recreationco's indemnity obligation, though Recreationco must have sufficient assets to satisfy it. Fifth, the parties could consider tax indemnity insurance if available.

### B. Hotelco has $500 million of income from 2013 through 2017. Hotelco has $250 million of losses in 2018 and 2019. Remember that Hotelco is allowed also to carry back losses from 2020, and does not know yet how much its losses will be in 2020. Does this create a risk for Hotelco in partnering with Recreationco to carry back losses? If so, what can Hotelco do about this?

**Answer:** Yes, this creates a capacity constraint risk.

Here's the situation: there's only $500 million of past income available to absorb carrybacks. Hotelco's own losses from 2018 and 2019 total $250 million, and Recreationco wants to carry back $100 million. That uses $350 million, leaving only $150 million of remaining capacity. If 2020 losses exceed $150 million, Hotelco needs to preserve capacity for its own losses. Recreationco's carryback might displace Hotelco's 2020 carryback, which could cost Hotelco significant money.

For example, if 2020 losses are $300 million, only $150 million of capacity would remain. That means $150 million of Hotelco's 2020 losses would have to be carried forward at the 21% rate instead of being carried back at 35%, costing Hotelco $150 million times the 14% difference, or $21 million in lost tax benefit.

Hotelco should take several steps to address this. First, it should require subordination, meaning Recreationco's carryback is subordinate to Hotelco's own losses, so if 2020 losses exceed capacity, Recreationco's claim is reduced and Hotelco's losses get priority. Second, Hotelco could include a reopener clause stating that if 2020 losses exceed a certain threshold, the deal can be renegotiated or Recreationco's carryback is reduced proportionally. Third, Hotelco could cap Recreationco's use at a specific amount to preserve capacity for Hotelco's 2020 losses. Fourth, Hotelco could wait until year-end to assess 2020 losses and then determine how much capacity to offer Recreationco. Fifth, the parties could agree on a formula-based allocation, so if capacity is insufficient, they allocate it proportionally.

### C. Grace says that following to you: "The CARES Act was very generous, giving us an unexpected tax benefit. Do you think that U.S. government might pass more legislation like it?" Does this possibility create any risks for Hotelco in partnering with Recreationco to carry back losses? If so, what can Hotelco do?

**Answer:** Yes, legislative changes create risks for Hotelco.

Consider a scenario where Congress passes another law providing additional tax relief—for example, allowing corporations to carry back losses to 2012 or earlier, increasing tax rates for carryback to 40%, or removing the limitation that NOLs can only offset 80% of income. This creates risk because Hotelco might want to amend its returns again to take advantage of the new law, but Recreationco has already used capacity, reducing Hotelco's ability to benefit. Alternatively, Congress could pass less generous rules, and the IRS might scrutinize CARES Act carrybacks more closely, exposing Hotelco to audit risk specifically because of Recreationco's carryback.

Hotelco should take several steps to address this risk. First, it could include a legislative change clause stating that if new law provides additional benefits, they're shared or Hotelco has the right to revisit the deal. Second, it could include a most favored nation clause providing that if the government provides more generous terms later, both parties benefit or Hotelco gets the right to reclaim some of Recreationco's benefit. Third, it could include a clawback provision providing that if the law changes to make carrybacks less attractive, Hotelco can claw back some of Recreationco's refund. Fourth, the parties could agree to monitor tax legislation and renegotiate if significant changes occur. Fifth, they could agree on a cap and adjust approach, putting a cap on Recreationco's total benefit with the ability to adjust within the cap if the law changes.

### D. Recreationco has been losing a lot of money, and business continues to be very bad. What risk (if any) does this create for Hotelco in partnering with Recreationco to carry back losses?

**Answer:** Recreationco's poor financial condition creates several risks for Hotelco.

First, there's credit risk: Recreationco might go bankrupt, and if Recreationco had agreed to indemnify Hotelco, that indemnity becomes worthless, leaving Hotelco potentially responsible for IRS challenges. Second, there are future capacity needs: Recreationco might have more losses in 2020, 2021, and beyond, and might want to carry those back too, which could further reduce capacity for Hotelco. Third, there's ongoing audit risk: if Recreationco's business is troubled, it's more likely to have taken aggressive tax positions, creating higher risk of IRS challenges. Fourth, there's reputational risk: if Recreationco fails, it might reflect poorly on Hotelco's judgment since Hotelco spun it off recently.

Hotelco should take several steps to address these risks. First, it could require a financial strength test where Recreationco must maintain minimum net worth, and if it drops below a threshold, the deal terminates to protect Hotelco's indemnity. Second, Hotelco could require security or collateral, such as a letter of credit or guarantee, to secure Hotelco against Recreationco's insolvency, especially for indemnity obligations. Third, Hotelco could limit future carrybacks so the deal only covers 2018 and 2019 losses, with 2020 and beyond requiring separate negotiation. Fourth, Hotelco could include a right to terminate if Recreationco's financial condition deteriorates, allowing Hotelco to terminate the agreement or amend returns to remove Recreationco's losses. Fifth, Recreationco could obtain insurance, such as business interruption insurance or tax liability insurance, to protect both parties. Sixth, Hotelco could get monitoring rights to access Recreationco's financial information to assess ongoing creditworthiness and get early warning of problems.

The key insight is that partnering with a financially troubled company creates significant risks, and the agreement must protect Hotelco from Recreationco's potential insolvency and continuing business problems.

## Key Takeaways

### Tax Basics

First, the value of deductions equals the deduction amount multiplied by the marginal tax rate, so a higher tax rate means a more valuable deduction. This is why carrybacks to pre-2018 years are so valuable—35% versus 21%. Second, Net Operating Losses are created when expenses exceed income and can be carried forward to offset future income or, under the CARES Act, carried back to get immediate refunds, making them a critical tool for businesses with volatile income.

### CARES Act NOL Provisions

The CARES Act provided temporary, retroactive relief for losses from 2018, 2019, and 2020. It included a five-year carryback versus zero years under 2017 law, no 80% limitation for the carryback period, indefinite carryforward for remaining losses, and applied only to losses from those three specific years. The policy rationale was to get immediate cash to businesses, use higher tax rates from past years, and provide economic stimulus during the pandemic.

### Spinoffs and Tax Attributes

The core problem is that spinoffs create separate companies, but the tax history belongs to the parent, not the subsidiary. A subsidiary with losses cannot carry back on its own and requires cooperation with the parent. Tax matters agreements allocate tax attributes between companies, govern who can amend pre-spinoff returns, determine who gets refunds, and create both rights and restrictions.

### Cooperation Problems

Recreationco needs Hotelco because it cannot carry back losses alone, needs Hotelco to amend returns, the refund goes to Hotelco under the tax matters agreement, and it must negotiate to access the benefit. Hotelco has leverage because it controls amendable returns, keeps refunds under the agreement, has its own losses to carry back, and bears all audit and legislative risks. But both can benefit: $35 million of potential value for Recreationco, Hotelco can demand a fee or risk premium, and cooperation creates $35 million of value that wouldn't exist otherwise.

### Risk Allocation

The major risks for Hotelco include audit risk from amending returns that opens IRS scrutiny, capacity constraints from limited past income to absorb carrybacks, legislative risk from future law changes, credit risk that Recreationco might become insolvent, and priority disputes over which losses get priority for limited capacity.

Risk mitigation tools include indemnification where Recreationco reimburses Hotelco for all tax-related costs, subordination where Hotelco's losses get priority over Recreationco's, caps and limits to restrict Recreationco's use of tax attributes, security like letters of credit or collateral, termination rights to exit the deal if circumstances change, and legislative adjustment provisions to revisit the deal if the law changes.

### Economic Insights

First, interdependence in transactions means that corporate transactions create ongoing relationships—spinoffs don't fully separate companies, and tax, accounting, and operational ties remain, so cooperation can create value for both parties. Second, risk allocation matters because every provision allocates risk between parties, more risk means more compensation is required, and careful drafting protects both parties. Third, information and incentives matter: Recreationco has more information about its losses, Hotelco bears the tax risk, and alignment requires careful agreement design. Fourth, value creation through cooperation is possible: without cooperation, there's zero value for Recreationco's losses, but with cooperation, $35 million of value is created, and both parties can share in this created value, which is the essence of transactional lawyering.

## Notes for Class Discussion

Several points to remember for class discussion. Tax affects everything, even "simple" spinoffs have complex tax implications, and the CARES Act context matters because this was pandemic relief, so understanding the policy helps understand the law. Both sides can win—cooperation problems aren't zero-sum and creative solutions create value. Risk allocation is key because every partnership requires thinking about what could go wrong. Tax matters agreements are critical because they govern ongoing relationships after spinoffs. Numbers matter—$35 million is at stake, so these are real economic benefits. NOL carrybacks are complex, with multiple years, tax rates, and limitations all interacting.
