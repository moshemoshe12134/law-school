## Key Concepts Overview (the Deals lens)

Three recurring problems show up twice in this unit:

1. **Search costs / screening:** Publishers need a low-cost way to identify promising books without reading everything.
2. **Information asymmetry:** Authors know more about quality/market than publishers; agents claim they have relationships/strategy, but the author can’t easily verify it.
3. **Agency costs:** Agents (and publishers) may optimize for themselves unless the contract + reputation makes that expensive.

Two operating heuristics:
- When you can’t specify effort well, **pay percentage** (align incentives).
- When you can’t verify claims, use **signals** (track record, reputation) and **terms that force truth-telling** (audit, reporting, termination + tail, non-circumvention).

## 1. Why “elite publishers only work with agents” (and why academics differ)

### 1A. Why do elite publishing houses require agents?

Core functions (each maps to a Deals “problem”):
- **Screening / reduced search costs:** agents filter out weak proposals so editors can allocate time efficiently.
- **Signaling / reputational bonding:** agents are repeat players; submitting a project is a reputational stake (a credible “this might sell” signal).
- **Transaction-cost reduction:** agents standardize process (submission packages, market targeting, term negotiation), saving the publisher from educating each first-time author.
- **Information production:** agents know which editors/ imprints buy what; they route proposals to “good fit” buyers (reduces mismatches).

### 1B. Why is this less important for academic presses?

Academic presses often rely on different screening infrastructure:
- **Peer review / credential-based screening** substitutes for agent-as-screener.
- **Different objective function:** prestige/mission and niche contribution can matter more than mass-market sales; the “commercial hit” prediction problem is less central.
- **Lower advances + different marketing expectations:** fewer high-stakes “winner-take-most” bets; less need for an agent to curate and negotiate the same way.

## 2. Early agent red flags and how to learn more

### 2A. Alice refuses to name target publishers until hired — reasonable or concerning?

Both readings exist:
- **Harmless read:** she doesn’t want to give away a curated list/strategy for free (protects against the author taking the list and running the process alone).
- **Concerning read:** she might be hiding weak relationships/strategy; refusal blocks basic diligence the author needs before granting exclusive authority.

What matters: whether she will give **verifiable signals** of competence without giving away her entire playbook.

### 2B. How can Barbara learn more without hiring her first?

Due diligence questions that force credible information:
- **Track record:** recent deals in the genre; which imprints/editors; typical advances/royalty structures.
- **Submission strategy in outline form:** categories of targets + rationale (not necessarily names of every editor).
- **References:** prior authors (especially first-timers) and what happened (how many submissions; how long; what the outcome was).
- **Process transparency:** frequency of updates; author approval of submission list; who controls timing and negotiation.

Use the “red flags” checklist as a filter:
- No track record / evasive strategy / asks for money beyond commission are high-signal problems (`agentredflags.md`).

---

## 3. The agency agreement terms (what they’re doing)

### 3A. “Gross Proceeds” definition is extremely broad — why does an agent ask for this?

Agency-cost problem: author can re-label compensation to dodge the 15% cut.

Broad “gross proceeds” tries to prevent:
- “Free books + paid speaking fee” end-runs (agent says: if the book drove the speaking fee, it’s part of proceeds).
- Side deals and affiliate/designee routing.

Risk to author: the definition can overreach and tax genuinely separate income streams.

### 3B. Continuation period + list requirement (post-termination commissions)

**Continuation period** is the anti-circumvention device:
- Protects agent if she set up near-term interest and the author terminates right before signing.

**Why the list matters:**
- Protects the author against the agent claiming “I caused that deal” after the fact.
- Creates an administrable trigger: “did the eventual buyer appear on the list?”

Reasonableness turns on:
- Tail length (6 months is in the normal range) and
- Whether the commission applies only to deals the agent materially sourced/negotiated, not anything forever.

### 3C. “Second book with the same publisher → automatic agent” (and limits)

Business logic: if the first publisher relationship exists because of Alice, she wants to capture some of the sequel value.

But this needs limits:
- **Time limit:** if sequel is years later, the causal link weakens.
- **Key-person clause:** if Alice is no longer practicing, author needs a clear off-ramp (or at least an election to keep her/assign to a specified successor).
- **Termination for cause / incompatibility:** if the relationship breaks, “auto-agent” should not be irrevocable.

The Authors Guild guide flags “agency coupled with an interest” language as a major issue; it is usually deletable (`Agencyagreements.md`).

### 3D. Minimum fee + 15% (and the perverse incentive)

Why minimum fees are atypical:
- A standard commission aligns incentives: agent gets paid only if author gets paid.

Why a first-time-author agent asks anyway:
- Risk of no deal / high effort to place the book; minimum fee is “insurance” for the agent.

The structural problem in the provided formula:
- If the minimum fee **phases out** above a threshold, the agent can be **better off with a smaller advance**, which misaligns incentives.

Fix options (tradeoffs):
- Keep **15% only** (best alignment; agent may refuse).
- Keep **minimum fee + 15% across the whole range** (removes incentive distortion; can overpay agent on big deals).
- Convert minimum fee into a **recoupable advance against commission** (agent gets some protection but still wants a higher deal).

## 4. Packaging Press proposal (author buys 5,000 copies)

### 4A. Who bears the “book won’t sell” risk?

Packaging model shifts a large chunk of downside to the author:
- Author commits cash to inventory (5,000 × $12 = $60,000).
- If the market is smaller than expected, author is stuck with unsold copies.

### 4B. Business advice: what should Barbara consider?

Checklist:
- **Market size + conversion:** how many realistic buyers exist, and can she reach them?
- **Distribution capability:** she is being asked to do a chunk of sales/marketing the publisher is better positioned to do.
- **Channel conflict:** if the publisher sells on Amazon too, they compete with her resale plan.
- **Working capital + storage + fulfillment costs:** “$12 per copy” is not the full cost of self-distribution.

### 4C. Royalty math: self-sales vs publisher sales; list vs net

To compare “10% royalty” to self-selling, you need:
- Is 10% computed on **list price** (better for author) or **net receipts** after retailer discounts (worse)?
- What is the list price? What discount does Amazon/retail take?

Rule of thumb: if she can sell copies herself at a meaningful markup over $12 (plus her costs), self-sales can dominate per-unit. But it’s higher effort and higher risk.

## 5. Publisher Press draft publishing agreement (assigned contract)

### 5A. Risk allocation: who bears the risk the book won’t sell?

PP structure is **profit participation** (50% of “Profits”) with **no advance** (`dealspublishinggreement.md` §6(c)):
- Publisher is fronting costs but recoups them before profits are shared.
- Author can end up with little/zero payout if profits stay negative (even if revenue exists).

### 5B. Does Barbara ever have to buy books?

Two places matter:
- **Author purchases:** optional, at 50–60% discount; not subject to profit participation (`dealspublishinggreement.md` §7(a)).
- **Out-of-print/rights reversion:** if she triggers termination, publisher can require her to buy “excess inventory” (`dealspublishinggreement.md` §8(d)).

If “never buy books” is a hard constraint, she should:
- Narrow or delete §8(d), and
- Ensure “out of print” isn’t defined in a way that lets the publisher keep rights while staying negative indefinitely (§8(a)).

### 5C. How is Barbara compensated (vs Packaging Press)?

PP: 50% of “Profits” (gross receipts minus defined recoupable costs, reserves, etc.) (`dealspublishinggreement.md` §6(a)).  
Packaging: author buys inventory and keeps resale spread, plus royalties on publisher sales.

Which is better depends on:
- Expected sales volume and price,
- The cost structure (what counts as “recoupable”),
- Whether she has a real comparative advantage in selling to her niche.

### 5D. Remaindering clause: why does Alice object?

PP remainder sales are excluded from profit participation (`dealspublishinggreement.md` §6(g)).

Agent concern:
- Publisher can characterize sales as “remainders” and avoid sharing profits, even though revenue is real.

Publisher’s counter:
- Incentive to clear excess inventory efficiently; if profit participation applied, author might veto or litigate and inventory would sit.

Fix:
- Allow remaindering but include a **floor** payment per unit or a **remainder revenue share**, or treat remainder revenue as receipts with a reduced (but nonzero) author share.

## 6. Contract questions Barbara will ask (spot the pressure points)

### 6A. Who controls final language? (meticulous author)

Publisher has broad editing discretion; author’s approval cannot be “unreasonably withheld” (`dealspublishinggreement.md` §3(e)). Barbara will want:
- Clear “no material changes without approval” and/or a defined dispute process.

### 6B. Index

Contract forbids any index (“no index will be created”) (`dealspublishinggreement.md` §1(c)). If she wants one, this is a direct negotiation point.

### 6C. E-book

Publisher gets electronic rights (`dealspublishinggreement.md` §3(a)(i)). The contract does not clearly commit to producing an e-book on any timeline. Barbara should ask for:
- A publication obligation for the e-book (or a reversion of e-rights if not exploited by a deadline).

### 6D. Temper / “politically incorrect” (risk warning)

Morals clause: publisher can terminate and demand return of unearned monies if she is charged/accused of certain misconduct or becomes a scandal (`dealspublishinggreement.md` §4). Her public behavior becomes contract risk.

### 6E. Bulk discount for consulting clients

Contract addresses:
- Author purchases at discount (§7(a)).
- Third-party bulk purchases: discount set case-by-case; prepays required for special print run (§7(c)).

If she wants predictable bulk terms, she should negotiate:
- Pre-set tiered discounts + a clear process/timeline for fulfillment.

### 6F. Travel costs for promotional events

PP pays reasonable travel/hotel/meals if it requests travel, but those costs are recoupable (reduces profits) (`dealspublishinggreement.md` §9 + §6(a)).

### 6G. Sequel / next book obligation

Publisher option on next full-length work (`dealspublishinggreement.md` §3(c)). It’s not an automatic obligation, but it gives PP first bite. If Barbara wants flexibility, she should narrow:
- Scope (only true sequels),
- Time window, and
- “Match right” mechanics.

### 6H. Audit rights

Audit only through an independent CPA, on notice, at publisher’s place; publisher pays only if error ≥5% (`dealspublishinggreement.md` §6(f)).

For a “numbers person” who wants to self-check, she should ask for:
- More detailed statements, supporting documentation rights, and/or a lower trigger/expanded access (still respecting confidentiality).

### 6I. NY author disadvantage in disputes

Forum is Ohio (Hamilton County) with waiver of inconvenient forum (`dealspublishinggreement.md` §13). That increases the author’s dispute cost and reduces practical leverage.

---

## 7. Is PP’s deal “final”? (publication obligation problem)

### 7A. Concern even after signing: is PP committed to publish?

Publisher reserves broad rights not to publish:
- Publication is conditioned on delivery of a “final Work” and publisher acceptance; publisher also has broad rejection/termination language (`dealspublishinggreement.md` §4–5).

### 7B. Why would PP structure it this way? What should Barbara ask for?

PP is protecting itself against:
- Quality risk (“final Work” not satisfactory),
- Legal risk (libel/privacy/copyright), and
- Reputation/morals risk.

Barbara should seek:
- Objective acceptance standards + a cure process,
- A real publication commitment (or a reversion + liquidated remedy if they walk without cause after acceptance),
- Narrower termination triggers and clearer definitions (especially morals clause and “unacceptable” manuscript).

## Notes for Class Discussion

- Always map a term to a problem: **search costs**, **info asymmetry**, **agency costs**, **uncertainty**.
- When a clause looks weird, name the incentive it creates (e.g., minimum fee phase-out; “remainder” exclusion; “out of print but only if profits positive”).
- Use “fix menu”: redefine terms, add deadlines, add reporting/audit, add termination + tail, add floors/caps, reallocate who controls.
