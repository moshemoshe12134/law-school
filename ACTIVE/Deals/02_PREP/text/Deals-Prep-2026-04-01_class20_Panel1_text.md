## Key Concepts Overview

This class explores the economics of **profit participation contracts in Hollywood**, focusing on a central puzzle: Why do "net profits" clauses persist when they so rarely pay out?

The **three main perspectives** we'll examine:

1. **Goldberg (Incentive Alignment):** Net and gross participations are about **timing and incentives**—who contributes effort when, and how to keep the studio motivated to market the film.

2. **Weinstein (Risk Allocation):** Profit-sharing is primarily about **allocating risk** and dealing with asymmetric information between studio and talent.

3. **De Vany (Uncertainty & Information):** Movie success is wildly unpredictable ("nobody knows anything"), so contingent compensation helps bridge information gaps when outcomes can't be forecasted.

**The core puzzle:** If successful movies often show no "net profits" (Coming to America, Batman, Forrest Gump), why do talented people accept net profit deals instead of demanding fixed fees?

---

## Question 1: Information and Incentives — Studios and Theater Owners

### A. Standard theater distribution deals

**What is the usual arrangement between studio and theater owner?**

**NOT fixed fees either way.** The standard arrangement is **revenue sharing** — typically a 90/10 split (after the "house nut" — the theater's fixed costs).

The theater keeps roughly 50% of box office receipts and remits 50% to the distributor (studio).

**According to Goldberg, why this structure?**

**Timing and incentives.** Both parties' efforts affect box office:
- **Studio's effort:** National advertising campaign, producing prints
- **Theater's effort:** Local marketing, screen scheduling, promotional displays

Revenue sharing gives **both parties skin in the game** and incentives to maximize revenue.

### B. How does the deal change over a movie's "run"?

**The distributor's share declines over time.**

Typical structure:
- **Weeks 1-2:** Studio gets ~70% of box office
- **By week 8:** Studio's share declines to ~35-40%

Or alternatively: Studio gets the greater of (a) 90% of receipts above house nut OR (b) a declining percentage floor.

**Goldberg's explanation: This reflects timing of effort.**

- **Early weeks:** Studio's marketing effort is front-loaded (huge ad blitz before/around release)
- **Later weeks:** Theater's ongoing effort matters more (keeping screens, word-of-mouth)

The sharing formula shifts to compensate whoever's effort is most critical at each phase.

**Is this about information, incentives, or something else?**

**Incentives.** Both parties face a **moral hazard problem** — outcomes depend on both parties' efforts. The shifting compensation structure aligns incentives with when each party contributes most.

### C. Tina's independent theater — showing the film late in its run

**Is Tina likely to receive a fixed fee or pay a fixed fee?**

**Likely PAYS a fixed fee** (or close to it).

**Why?**

When Tina gets the movie late:
- Studio's promotional efforts have long since ceased
- Tina bears all the ongoing marketing effort
- Information asymmetry is minimal (box office performance is known)
- Risk allocation favors Tina knowing exactly what she'll pay

This is the opposite of four-walling (see below).

### D. Talia's luxury theater — "four-walling"

**What is "four-walling"?**

Studio rents the theater at a **fixed fee** and keeps ALL box office receipts.

**Is Talia likely to receive or pay a fixed fee?**

**Receives a fixed fee** — she's essentially a landlord, not a revenue-sharing partner.

**Why four-wall?**

- Studio wants **massive local advertising push** (TV, radio) in a major market
- Studio takes over most of the exhibitor's marketing function
- The studio effectively becomes both distributor and exhibitor for that location/period

**The incentive logic:**

By keeping all revenue above the fixed rental fee, studio captures full upside from its promotional investment — solving the under-investment problem that would exist if it shared revenue with the theater.

### E. Franco — the foreign subdistributor

**What kind of deal is Franco likely to strike?**

Franco pays the studio:
1. **A fixed lump sum** upfront (based on expected marketability)
2. Keeps all revenue until reaching a **rolling breakeven point** (covering his initial payment + distribution costs + fee)
3. Then splits additional revenue **~50/50 with the studio**

**What is this structure?**

It's essentially the **same deal the studio gives net profit participants** — but with the studio and Franco's roles reversed.

### F. Why does this structure serve the parties' interests?

**Effect on incentives:**

- **Before breakeven:** Franco keeps 100% of marginal revenue → strong incentive to market and distribute aggressively
- **After breakeven:** Franco still keeps 50% of marginal revenue → still has incentive to promote, though weaker

**For the studio:** This timing structure (Franco does most work AFTER studio has finished) means the studio wants Franco to have strong incentives — hence the post-breakeven sharing.

### G. What information problem does it solve? Why compare to M&A earnouts?

**The information problem:**

The studio sells distribution rights **before the movie is finished** — there's asymmetric information about:
- The studio's private assessment of the film's quality
- Franco's private assessment of local market conditions

**The parallel to M&A earnouts:**

Like a seller taking part of the purchase price as an **earnout** contingent on future performance, the studio accepting a profit-sharing component:

1. **Signals confidence** in the film's quality ("we believe in this product")
2. **Bridges valuation gaps** when parties disagree on value
3. **Reduces need for costly information production** — no need to spend months investigating each other's private information

Both parties can agree to a deal faster, with less due diligence, because sharing reduces the stakes of being wrong.

## Question 2: Incentives — Profits Interests, Writers, and Producers

### A. Wilma the screenwriter — Why does Studio recover all costs first?

**The structure:** Wilma gets a share of "net profits" — but only after studio recovers ALL production costs, distribution costs, distribution fees, etc.

**i. What's the rationale? What incentive does it create for Studio?**

**The "rolling breakeven" preserves studio's marketing incentives.**

Remember: The studio makes massive distribution expenditures AFTER most talent (like Wilma) have finished their work.

If the studio had to share revenue from dollar one, it would have **weaker incentives** to spend on marketing and promotion.

By getting 100% of revenue until breakeven, the studio recoups its incremental marketing spending before sharing — keeping its incentives sharp.

**ii. Peter the producer — "overbudget penalty clause"**

**What is an overbudget penalty clause?**

If the film goes over budget by more than a specified amount, the producer's net profit share is **reduced**.

**According to Goldberg, what function does this serve (together with Peter's net participation)?**

**Balancing incentives:**

- **Net profit participation:** Rewards Peter for creating a successful, cost-effective film
- **Overbudget penalty:** Specifically penalizes excessive spending

The producer often has considerable control over production costs. This structure ensures he balances:
- Quality and gross revenue (stars, effects, production values)
- Cost containment (keeping the film affordable)

**iii. Wilma's situation — $50,000 for second script vs. $10,000 for first

"Obviously, that's good news. But my friends tell me that my net participation is unlikely to pay off."

**Is she right? What does Goldberg say?**

**YES, she's right — but she shouldn't be upset.**

Goldberg's analysis:
- Net profits participants **DO** get paid when films succeed **WITHOUT major gross participants**
- The problem comes when "gross participants" (big stars) are added — they push out the breakeven point dramatically

For example:
- Coming to America: Eddie Murphy's 15% gross points + other costs = never reached net profits
- Batman: Jack Nicholson's gross deal + others = never reached net profits
- Forrest Gump: Tom Hanks and Zemeckis had 8% gross each = barely reached net profits

But: **Flashdance, Airplane!, Grease** (no major stars) paid net profits handsomely.

**The key:** Whether the film has "gross participants" (stars getting percentage of gross receipts).

### iv. "Studios will cheat us whenever they can, right?" Does bargaining power explain the net profits formula?

**NO — Goldberg is skeptical.**

**Why bargaining power doesn't explain it:**

1. **If studios had all the power:** They'd just pay lower fixed fees, not create convoluted net profit formulas that make them look bad in court

2. **The formula is not arbitrary:** The structure matches the **timing of effort and incentives** (as explained throughout Goldberg's article)

3. **Net participants agree in advance** to dilution when gross participants are added (via "consultation clauses") — suggests they see value in the flexibility

4. **The "unconscionability" litigation misses the point:** Judges focus on whether overhead charges match "real" costs, but that's irrelevant — everyone in Hollywood knows "net profit" is a contractual term, not GAAP profit

**The real explanation:** The structure solves incentive problems in a sequential production process where different parties contribute at different times.

### v. For Wilma's net participation to pay off, what question matters most?

**"Will the studio add any gross participants (major stars) to this project?"**

**What else do you need to know?**

- **Are there already gross participants attached?** (If yes, her breakeven is already far out)
- **What is the production budget?** (Higher budget = higher breakeven)
- **Who else has net participations?** (Many net participants dilute the pool)

**The key insight:** Wilma's payout depends less on whether the movie succeeds than on **whether it succeeds without gross participants**.

---

### B. Incentives — Interaction of Net and Gross Profit Participations

**i. Peter signs Alicia Actress — a "really big name" with gross points. Why is this bad for Wilma?**

**Gross points shift out the breakeven point.**

Every dollar of revenue:
- First goes to pay studio's distribution fee (often 30-40%)
- Then goes to pay production costs
- Alicia's gross points are taken OFF THE TOP (e.g., 15% of adjusted gross)

So the net profit pool shrinks dramatically, and the breakeven point recedes further into the distance.

**ii. "You should be happy about this" — why is adding Alicia good news for Wilma (and Peter)?

**Even though their net participation is less likely to pay off, their expected value is HIGHER.**

**Goldberg's explanation:**

1. **Increased likelihood of production:** With a major star attached, the movie is more likely to get greenlit (Wilma gets her fixed fee)

2. **Increased likelihood of success:** Alicia's presence dramatically increases box office potential

3. **Career benefits:** A hit with a major star leads to better future opportunities and higher fixed fees for subsequent projects

**The counterintuitive result:** Wilma is better off accepting a smaller chance of backend payout in exchange for a higher chance of the movie being made and succeeding — which increases her overall expected compensation.

**iii. Doesn't Alicia's gross participation reduce Peter's incentive to control costs?

**YES, it does — but the studio is willing to accept this.**

**Why?**

When there's a major star like Alicia:
- The film's commercial success depends **more on the star's drawing power** than on the producer's cost containment
- Marketing is **front-loaded** (huge opening weekend push) rather than building slowly
- The studio's own post-release marketing incentives matter less because opening weekend performance determines success

The studio trades some producer cost-control incentives for the star's marketing power and box office draw.

**iv. How does gross participation motivate Alicia's post-production efforts?**

**Alicia can:**
- Promote the film on talk shows, press junkets, social media
- Do premieres and publicity events
- Leverage her star power to get wider distribution

**Gross participation gives her skin in the game:**

- She gets a percentage of every ticket sold
- More promotional effort → more box office → more money for Alicia
- Unlike net participation, she doesn't have to worry about whether the film reaches "breakeven" — she participates from the first dollar

**v. For films WITHOUT big stars, whose efforts become more important?

**The studio's marketing efforts and the producer's ongoing work.**

Without a guaranteed opening weekend draw from a star:
- Success depends on **building audience over time** through reviews, word-of-mouth
- The studio's **post-release marketing** becomes crucial
- The producer's promotional efforts matter more

**Does the typical deal structure create the right incentives?**

**YES:**

- Without gross participants, the studio keeps most revenue until breakeven → strong incentive to market aggressively
- Net participants (producer, writer) share in net profits → incentive to help promote

With gross participants, the studio's post-release marketing incentive is diluted, but that matters less because the star drives opening weekend.

**vi. Goldberg's view: Is this mainly about incentives or asymmetric information?

**BOTH — but primarily about INCENTIVES and TIMING.**

The **three key themes** in Goldberg:

1. **Timing of effort:** Different parties contribute at different phases (writer early, producer throughout, studio late)
2. **Incentive alignment:** Compensation structure shifts to match whose effort is most critical at each phase
3. **Information problems:** Earnout-like structure helps bridge valuation gaps when parties have private information

Goldberg emphasizes the **sequential nature of film production** and how contingent compensation is "phased" to maintain incentives throughout.

**vii. Wilma's next offer — "Should I insist that the studio can't grant anyone a gross participation?"

**NO — this would backfire.**

**Why?**

If Wilma insists on no gross participants:
- The studio **can't attract major stars** who demand gross points
- The movie is less likely to succeed
- The studio is less likely to greenlight the project
- Wilma's expected value goes DOWN

**The better strategy:**

Accept that gross participants might be added, but negotiate:
- A **consultation clause** (studio must discuss, can't reduce her share without talking)
- A **higher fixed fee** in exchange for flexibility
- **Adjustment formula** (if gross participants are added, her net percentage decreases but she gets other consideration)

**viii. "Pay or play" — what does this mean?

**The studio commits to paying talent even if the project is abandoned.**

If the studio decides:
- Not to make the movie at all → still pays the fixed fee
- To replace the talent → still pays the fixed fee

**What kind of option does this give Studio?**

This is an **option to abandon or substitute** — but at a cost.

The studio reserves flexibility to:
- Kill a project that's not working
- Replace a writer/producer/director/actor with someone better suited to the project as it evolves

**The cost:** The studio must pay the "pay or play" fee to exercise this option.

**Parallel to venture capital:** Just as VC staged financing creates an option to abandon, "pay or play" gives studios flexibility at a known price.

## Question 3: Monitoring and Incentives

### A. Andrew the actor — Does he need net participation for motivation?

**The setup:** Andrew receives net participation. Does he need it to be properly motivated?

**Potential argument:** His effort isn't observable, so he needs to be "self-motivated" through contingent pay.

**But wait:**

- **Delia the director** CAN observe whether Andrew is making an effort
- Andrew has other financial incentives (reputation, future work)

**Weinstein's view:**

Andrew may not need strong **effort incentives** because:
- Directors monitor actors closely during filming
- Reputation concerns are powerful — bad performance gets around the industry
- The studio has other levers (refusing to hire him again)

**Net participation for actors may serve OTHER functions** (risk allocation, information bridging) rather than pure motivation.

### B. Ned the novelist — adapting his book for the screen

**Ned wrote the novel 5 years ago. Someone else is writing the screenplay.**

**How important is it to motivate Ned?**

**NOT VERY** — his work on this movie is done.

**Is the rationale for his net participation incentive-based?**

**NO — it's NOT about effort incentives.**

Ned's net participation serves different purposes:
- **Risk allocation:** Sharing the risk of an uncertain adaptation
- **Information bridging:** If Ned knows more about the story's appeal than the studio, contingent pay bridges that gap
- **Value capture:** If the novel has proven value, sharing lets Ned participate in upside

**Weinstein's emphasis:** Net participation isn't ALWAYS about incentives — sometimes it's about risk and information.

### C. Studio era vs. modern actors

**In the studio era:** Actors were permanent employees
**Today:** Actors are hired picture-by-picture

**What effect on incentives to do best work?**

**Arguably WORSE today — but reputation markets help.**

**Studio era advantages:**
- Long-term employment relationship gave studios leverage over actors
- Future work at the studio was at stake
- Studios could monitor and discipline employees

**Today:**
- Each film is a one-shot transaction
- Less direct leverage for the studio
- **BUT** the reputation market provides discipline:

  - Bad performance → fewer future job offers
  - Difficult behavior → agents won't represent you
  - Box office track record → determines future salary

**Weinstein's point:** The change in employment structure may increase the importance of contingent compensation to align incentives, but reputation remains a powerful motivator.

---

## Question 4: Risk and Incentives

### A. Goldberg vs. Weinstein — Same or different views?

**They have DIFFERENT emphases:**

**Goldberg:** Primarily about **incentives and timing** — who contributes effort when, and how to maintain motivation throughout the production and marketing process.

**Weinstein:** Primarily about **risk allocation and information asymmetry** — why risk-averse talent would accept uncertain pay, and how contingent compensation bridges informational gaps.

### B. Is Weinstein more or less persuaded of the importance of motivating talent?

**LESS persuaded than Goldberg.**

**Weinstein's view:**

- Monitoring by directors can address effort problems for actors during production
- Reputation concerns are powerful motivators
- Net participation often serves functions OTHER than effort incentives

**Weinstein's alternative theory:**

Profit-sharing is mainly about:
1. **Risk allocation** (addressing studio executives' risk aversion or budget constraints)
2. **Information asymmetry** (bridging gaps between studio's and talent's private information)

### C. Studio shareholders are diversified — shouldn't studios be risk neutral?

**In theory: YES** — diversified shareholders should want studios to maximize expected value, regardless of risk.

**In practice: Studio executives may not act risk-neutral.**

### D. Why might studios behave as if they're risk averse?

**Agency costs within the studio.**

**The problem:** Studio executives face:
- **Fixed budgets** from corporate parents
- **Performance pressure** for consistent earnings
- **Career risk** from flops

Even if shareholders are diversified, executives may act **risk-averse** because:
- One big flop can end a career
- Studios have internal capital markets and allocation battles
- Executives are judged on metrics other than pure expected value (e.g., "no disasters on my watch")

**The result:** Studios may prefer contingent compensation that converts fixed costs (salaries) into variable costs (profit shares) — reducing their exposure.

### E. What risk-related function does Weinstein attribute to profit participations?

**Risk-sharing with talent.**

By making some compensation contingent:
- Studios shift some project risk to talent
- This may be efficient if talent is **less risk-averse** than studio executives
- Or if it allows studios to greenlight more projects (diversification across their slate)

### F. Information asymmetry between Paula (producer) and Andrew/Delia (talent)

**Paula knows:**
- The studio's assessment of the project's quality
- Marketing plans and distribution strategy
- Historical performance of similar films
- Budget constraints and greenlight criteria

**Andrew and Delia know:**
- Their own interest in and enthusiasm for the project
- Their assessment of the script/character
- Their other opportunities (opportunity cost)
- How much effort they're willing to put in

**How can contingent compensation bridge this gap?**

**For the studio's private information:**

- If Paula knows the film is likely to be a hit, she's more willing to give Andrew a larger backend share (she expects to pay it)
- If Paula knows the film is a dog, she'll offer more fixed, less contingent
- **Signal of confidence:** Large backend share signals studio's belief in the project

**For the talent's private information:**

- If Andrew knows he'll phone it in, he might prefer more fixed, less contingent (he doesn't expect big backend anyway)
- If Andrew knows he'll give 100% effort and believes in the project, he might accept more contingent pay
- **Screening mechanism:** Contract structure helps separate enthusiastic from opportunistic talent

### G. Responding to uncertainty — better predictions vs. profit-sharing

**If movie success is hard to predict, parties can:**

1. **Invest in prediction:** Hire experts, do test screenings, analyze comparable films
2. **Use profit-sharing contracts:** Share the risk rather than trying to predict outcomes

**Weinstein's view:**

Profit-sharing can be superior because:
- **Prediction is costly and often inaccurate** — De Vany shows "nobody knows anything"
- **Contracts can respond to uncertainty without accurate prediction**
- Both parties can proceed with less information, knowing they'll share outcomes

**The parallel to earnouts:** Just as M&A deals use earnouts when buyers and sellers disagree on value, movie contracts use profit participation when success is inherently unpredictable.

---

## Question 5: Dan the director — How important is effort?

### A. If Dan "goes through the motions" — will lack of effort impede success?

**Likely YES.**

A director's efforts matter for:
- **Motivating actors:** Drawing out good performances
- **Keeping production on schedule:** Avoiding costly overruns
- **Creative decisions:** Filming style, pacing, tone
- **Problem-solving:** Addressing issues that arise during shooting

If Dan doesn't try, the movie probably suffers.

### B. If Dan gives 100% — does that guarantee success?

**NO.**

According to **Arthur De Vany**:

> "If you don't know anything, then how do you pay a director or an actor?"

Movie success is driven by:
- **Unpredictable audience response** (nonlinear dynamics, information cascades)
- **Luck and timing** (competition, market conditions)
- **Quality of the script** (which Dan didn't write)
- **Performances of actors** (Dan influences but doesn't control)
- **Marketing effectiveness** (largely studio's domain, not Dan's)

**A great director with a great script and great actors can still make a flop.**

### C. Alan and Ann (the stars) — How important is their effort?

**If they don't try, will that scuttle the movie?**

**Possibly YES** — bad performances can ruin a film.

**If they do try, does that guarantee success?**

**NO** — for the same reasons as Dan:
- Audience may not respond to the material
- Competition may be stronger
- Marketing may fail
- Word-of-mouth may be negative

**De Vany's insight:** Even the best performances in the best films can't guarantee success — the "nobody knows" principle in action.

### D. Should Paula use contingent compensation for Dan, Alan, and Ann?

**i. If effort is important, is that an argument for incentive pay?**

**In theory: YES** — if you want to motivate effort, tie pay to outcomes that effort influences.

**But there's a problem:** Is the outcome (box office success) a good signal of effort?

### ii. True or false: The condition should reward effort and value added

**TRUE — in principle.**

For incentive compensation to work well:
- Reward should be **correlated with the thing you're trying to motivate** (effort, quality, contribution)
- Reward should be **withheld when they don't do a good job**

**But:** If success is largely random, contingent pay may not track effort well.

### iii. Are "net profits" interests calibrated to reward talent effort?

**NO — they're poorly calibrated.**

**The problem:**

- Net profits are paid only after the studio recovers ALL costs
- Whether net profits are reached depends on factors largely outside talent's control:
  - Production budget (set before talent's involvement)
  - Distribution spending (studio's decision)
  - Whether gross participants are added (studio's decision)
  - Distribution fees and overhead charges (contractual formula)

**A talented, hardworking director can make a great film that never reaches net profits** because of high costs or gross participants.

**Net profits are a BLUNT instrument for effort motivation.**

### iv. What about "gross participations"? Better calibrated or not?

**BETTER calibrated than net, but still imperfect.**

**Why gross is better:**

- Tied to revenue, not costs
- Talent gets paid from the first dollar (or after a fixed breakeven)
- More directly connected to box office performance

**Why still imperfect:**

- Box office depends on MANY factors beyond talent's effort (competition, timing, marketing)
- A great performance in a poorly marketed film might still fail
- A mediocre performance in a well-marketed film with a star might still succeed

**The De Vany insight:** When success is driven by extreme events and nonlinear dynamics, tying compensation to outcomes may be a noisy measure of effort.

---

## Question 6: Meeting with Arthur De Vany

### A. The "weight of students" thought experiment

**What is the experiment?**

- 50 students average 148 lbs = 7,400 lbs total
- Add a 200 lb person → average rises to 149 lbs
- Add a 100 lb person → average falls back to 148 lbs
- **BUT** add a 9,000 lb gorilla → average more than DOUBLES to 315 lbs
- Then add a 20,000 lb lizard → average jumps to 680 lbs

**What's the point?**

**Extreme events dominate the average.** In movies:
- A few massive hits (gorillas, lizards) account for most profits
- "About 5 percent of movies earn close to 80 percent of motion picture profit"
- Most movies are "normal-sized" (like the 50 students)
- The big ones completely distort the average

**This is the "business of extremes"** — Pareto-Levy stable distribution with "fat tails."

### B. "5% earn 80% of profit" — Should this influence incentive compensation?

**To what extent does effort determine top 5% status?**

**De Vany's answer: VERY LITTLE.**

Effort matters at the margins, but:
- **Luck plays a huge role** — timing, competition, audience preferences
- **Nonlinear dynamics** — small differences amplified through information cascades
- **Unpredictable "hits"** — nobody knows which movies will break out

**Implication for incentive pay:**

If success is largely random:
- Tying compensation to "being in the top 5%" may reward LUCK more than EFFORT
- Talent might prefer more guaranteed compensation rather than betting on extreme outcomes

### C. "That's why it's so important to motivate the talent" — How would De Vany respond?

**De Vany would be skeptical.**

**His response:**

"If success is driven by extreme events and nonlinear dynamics that nobody can predict or control, then **motivation through contingent pay may be futile**."

- You can motivate effort, but you can't motivate a hit
- Better to acknowledge uncertainty and design contracts that work WITH it, not pretend you can control outcomes

### D. What shapes demand for a specific movie? How predictable are these factors?

**Demand is shaped by nonlinear, unpredictable factors:**

- **Information cascades:** People choose what others are choosing (box office reports create self-reinforcing patterns)
- **Social networks and word-of-mouth:** Amplify or suppress reception
- **Timing and competition:** What else is opening, weather, events
- **Tastes and trends:** Evolving in unpredictable ways (the "violence spiral" or "dialogue spiral" De Vany describes)

**How predictable? NOT VERY.**

The "nonlinear dynamic" means small differences in initial conditions can lead to massive differences in outcomes — the hallmark of chaotic systems.

### E. Once a movie is made, how costly is it to show to more people?

**VIRTUALLY ZERO marginal cost.**

- The film is already made
- Additional prints or digital copies cost very little
- Each additional viewer leaves "no less of the film for others"

**This infinite reproducibility is what allows revenues to reach extreme values** — there's no supply constraint to cap the upside.

### F. "If you don't know anything, then how do you pay a director or an actor?"

**De Vany's answer: PAY WHEN YOU KNOW.**

- **Wait until after the film has run**
- **Then pay based on actual outcomes**
- Use contracts "conditioned on outcomes far into the tail of the distribution"

**"Contracting in the tails":**

Director contracts often have triggers based on extreme outcomes (e.g., "$500,000 bonus if domestic gross exceeds $200 million") — events that would have essentially zero probability in a normal (Gaussian) distribution but are common in movie industry.

**These contracts recognize the Pareto world we live in.**

### G. Is De Vany recommending contingent compensation to motivate talent?

**NOT EXACTLY — he's recommending it as a RESPONSE to uncertainty.**

For De Vany:
- The primary problem is **unpredictability**, not motivation
- Contingent compensation allows parties to proceed when they **don't know what will happen**
- By conditioning pay on extreme outcomes, contracts acknowledge the reality of the business

**This is different from Goldberg's incentive-based rationale.**

### H. Is De Vany's analysis more like Goldberg's or Weinstein's?

**More like Weinstein's.**

- **De Vany:** Emphasizes **uncertainty and information problems**
- **Weinstein:** Emphasizes **risk allocation and information asymmetry**
- **Goldberg:** Emphasizes **incentive alignment and timing of effort**

Both De Vany and Weinstein see contingent compensation as addressing **risk and information** more than **motivation** — whereas Goldberg provides the incentive-focused account.

## Key Takeaways

### The Three Perspectives on Hollywood Profit-Sharing

**Goldberg (Incentives):**
- Net and gross participations align incentives across the **sequential production process**
- Studio gets 100% until breakeven → preserves marketing incentives
- Gross participants get paid from first dollar → motivates their promotional efforts
- Structure matches **who contributes effort when**

**Weinstein (Risk & Information):**
- Profit-sharing allocates risk between studio and talent
- Bridges **information asymmetries** about project quality and talent enthusiasm
- Responds to **agency costs** — studio executives' risk aversion and budget constraints
- Not primarily about effort incentives

**De Vany (Uncertainty):**
- Movie success follows **Pareto-Levy distribution** — extreme events dominate
- "About 5% of movies earn 80% of profits"
- **"Nobody knows anything"** — success is inherently unpredictable
- Contingent compensation allows parties to proceed despite uncertainty
- **"Contracting in the tails"** — conditioning pay on extreme outcomes

### Core Insights

**1. The Net Profits Puzzle: Why accept a share of something that rarely exists?**

**Answer:** Because the overall expected value of the compensation package is HIGHER with contingent pay.

- Net participation increases the chance of greenlight and success
- Net participants are made better off ex ante when gross participants are added
- The structure solves timing and incentive problems that pure fixed fees can't

**2. Net vs. Gross: What's the difference?**

Both are contingent compensation with breakeven points:
- **Net participation:** Breakeven depends on costs, receipts, and distribution fees (rolling)
- **Gross participation:** Breakeven is a fixed dollar amount (or from "first dollar")

**The breakeven location matters:**
- Net participants are paid AFTER studio recoups all costs
- Gross participants are paid much earlier (often from first dollar above fixed fee)

**3. Timing of effort explains the structure:**

- **Writer/producer early:** Net participation gives them skin in the game while studio makes most decisions
- **Star added later:** Gross participation motivates their promotional efforts
- **Studio late:** Gets 100% until breakeven to preserve marketing incentives

**4. Information asymmetries are pervasive:**

- Studio knows more about film quality and marketing plans
- Talent knows more about their own enthusiasm and effort level
- **Contingent pay bridges these gaps** — like an earnout in M&A

**5. Movie success is wildly unpredictable:**

- Extreme events (blockbusters) drive most profits
- Nonlinear dynamics and information cascades shape outcomes
- **Effort matters, but luck matters more** than people think

### The Lawyer's Role: Designing Hollywood Contracts

When structuring profit participation deals:

**1. Identify the core problems:**
- **Incentive alignment:** Who needs to be motivated to do what, when?
- **Risk allocation:** Who can best bear the uncertainty of outcomes?
- **Information asymmetry:** What private information does each party have?

**2. Match the tool to the problem:**
- **Net participation:** Preserves studio's marketing incentives, rewards early contributors
- **Gross participation:** Motivates stars' promotional efforts, shares revenue early
- **Pay or play:** Gives studio flexibility to abandon or substitute
- **Consultation clauses:** Protects early participants from excessive dilution

**3. Acknowledge the business reality:**
- **"Net profits" is a contractual term, not GAAP profit**
- Successful films often don't reach "net profits" due to gross participants
- The structure persists because it serves economic functions, not because it's "fair" in an accounting sense

**4. Recognize the limits of contracting:**
- When success is driven by extreme events and nonlinear dynamics, no contract can perfectly align incentives with effort
- Sometimes the best contract is one that **acknowledges uncertainty** rather than trying to eliminate it

## Notes for Class Discussion

**Key themes to emphasize:**

1. **The puzzle is real:** Net profit clauses DO rarely pay out — but they persist for rational economic reasons

2. **Three complementary explanations:** Goldberg (incentives), Weinstein (risk/info), De Vany (uncertainty) — all contribute to understanding

3. **The sequential nature of film production** is crucial to understanding the contract structure

4. **"Net profit" is a defined term, not an accounting concept** — the litigation misunderstands this

5. **The Hollywood analogy to M&A earnouts** is powerful — both address timing and information problems

6. **Extreme events dominate outcomes** — this explains why "nobody knows anything" and why contracts look the way they do

**Be prepared to discuss:**

- Whether net participation is about incentives (Goldberg) or risk allocation (Weinstein) or both
- How the "consultation clause" solves the dilution problem
- Why adding a gross participant can be GOOD for net participants (ex ante vs. ex post)
- Whether effort actually matters for movie success (De Vany's skepticism)
- The difference between Gaussian (normal) and Pareto-Levy (fat-tailed) distributions

**Exam relevance:**

- Understanding **when contingent compensation serves incentive vs. risk-sharing vs. information functions**
- Applying **timing-of-effort analysis** to other deal structures
- Recognizing **when extreme events and uncertainty** make traditional contracting approaches problematic
- **Earnout logic** in contexts beyond M&A (films, startups, licensing deals)
