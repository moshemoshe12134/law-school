## Key Concepts Overview (the Deals lens)

Three buckets to keep straight:

1. **Vertical integration (VI):** one firm owns multiple stages of a supply chain (here: production + distribution + exhibition).
2. **Antitrust worry:** VI can be used to **foreclose rivals** (deny them access to key inputs/customers) or to **support collusion** (monitor/enforce output limits).
3. **Efficiency story:** VI can solve real Deals problems (uncertainty + incomplete contracting + information/asymmetric verification + enforcement problems).

Two competition terms that show up repeatedly in *Paramount*:
- **First-run theaters:** the premium “new release” screens; control here can matter more than total theater count.
- **Market power without formal monopoly:** the ability to exclude or disadvantage rivals in practice (especially if coordinated).

## 1. The Edison Trust (Motion Picture Patents Company)

### 1A. Why “Edison trust”?

Because it aggregated and leveraged **Edison’s camera + projection patents** and associated licensing control (`EdisontrustBritannica.md`).

### 1B. Source of leverage; key source of value early on

Leverage came from controlling critical complements:
- **Patents** on equipment needed to make/show films, and
- **Film stock supply** via a restriction arrangement with Eastman Kodak (`EdisontrustBritannica.md`).

Early value was less “star IP” and more:
- the ability to **produce and project** films with access to the tech and inputs, and
- access to **distribution/showing channels** that were constrained by licensing.

### 1C. Why forbid identifying actors?

To prevent actors from becoming brands with bargaining power. Identification makes talent **scarce + portable**, which drives up wages (`EdisontrustBritannica.md`).

### 1D. What other constraint did it impose; why; is it more plausible then?

It **limited film length** to one–two reels (10–20 minutes) on the theory that audiences would not sit longer (`EdisontrustBritannica.md`).

That belief is more plausible in an early, novelty stage:
- shorter attention norms,
- weaker storytelling tech (no sound; cruder production),
- more uncertainty about demand for longer-form content.

### 1E. East coast vs Hollywood; causal connection?

The industry consolidated in **Hollywood**. Britannica ties the shift to independents moving west to reduce exposure to the Trust’s enforcement and influence (`EdisontrustBritannica.md`).

## 2. Three phases in producing a motion picture

### 2A. Production

**Production** = making the film (financing + shooting + post-production).

### 2B. Distribution

**Distribution** = getting the film into theaters (licensing/booking, marketing coordination, release strategy).

### 2C. Exhibition

**Exhibition** = showing the film to consumers (theater operations and programming).

---

## 3. The “Studio Era” and the meaning of vertical integration

### 3A. Defining feature (1915–1948)

The defining feature is **common ownership across stages**: studios were integrated across production, distribution, and (critically) exhibition.

### 3B. What marked the end?

The *Paramount* litigation and remedy phase is the canonical marker in this unit: the government challenge and the Court’s approach to VI + exhibition control (`Paramountdivestiture.md`).

### 3C. What is vertical integration?

**Vertical integration** = one firm owns multiple stages of the supply chain (here: production + distribution + exhibition).

---

## 4. *United States v. Paramount Pictures* (focus: ownership structure / divestiture)

### 4A. Three groups of defendants; what’s special about group 1?

From the syllabus summary:
- **Group 1:** producers with affiliates that **distribute + exhibit** and **own/control theaters** (the vertically integrated majors).
- **Group 2:** producers + distributors (no exhibition ownership).
- **Group 3:** distributor only.  
Only Group 1 is charged on the VI/ownership structure issue in this excerpt (`Paramountdivestiture.md`).

### 4B. What did the government allege about group 1?

The government alleged conspiracy and monopolization (Sherman Act §§ 1 and 2) in **exhibition**, particularly in major cities, and argued that combining producing/distributing/exhibiting was part of the violation (`Paramountdivestiture.md`).

### 4C. Did any defendant have a national monopoly alone; did that matter?

The district court found none had a national monopoly by theater holdings “alone” (the five majors owned ~1/6 of theaters). The Supreme Court rejects treating that as dispositive; it instructs the district court to focus on what the conspiracy achieved and the relationship between restraints and exhibition position (`Paramountdivestiture.md`).

### 4D. Percent of theaters controlled; “enough”?

The majors had interests in a bit over **17%** of U.S. theaters (3,137 / 18,076), yet those theaters accounted for **45%** of domestic film rental received by all eight defendants (`Paramountdivestiture.md`).

That can still be “enough” if the controlled slice is the bottleneck (premium screens / first-run).

### 4E. Where did the Court see concentrated power; did it matter?

**First-run** exhibition in larger cities: in cities >100,000 population, at least **70% of first-run theaters** were affiliated with one or more majors (`Paramountdivestiture.md`).

The Court says the relationship between unlawful restraints and **first-run position** is of “first importance” on divestiture (`Paramountdivestiture.md`).

### 4F. Is there competition within first-run?

Sometimes yes:
- in about **60%** of those large cities, independents compete with majors in first-run;
- in about **91%**, there is competition in first-run between independents and majors or among majors (`Paramountdivestiture.md`).

The Court still treats first-run concentration as the core issue because the rents sit there.

### 4G. Is VI illegal per se? What is the Court’s test?

**Not per se.** The Court: legality turns on **(1) purpose/intent** or **(2) the power VI creates plus attendant purpose/intent** (`Paramountdivestiture.md`).

Working translation:
- **Bad VI**: structured to gain control over an appreciable market segment and suppress competition.
- **Potentially ok VI**: expansion to meet legitimate business needs, without monopoly power + exclusionary purpose.

### 4H. What evidence does the Court invoke; does it review effects?

The excerpt is heavy on **structure + market position** evidence (shares of theaters, shares of first-run, shares of rentals) and on the connection between restraints and exhibition position (`Paramountdivestiture.md`).

It is more structural than modern “effects” analysis: it treats concentration and exclusion capability as strong evidence of power and intent.

### 4I. Did the district court order divestiture; did the Supreme Court affirm?

The district court did **not** order total divestiture; it enjoined expansion. The Supreme Court **sets aside** the district court findings on divestiture/monopoly as deficient and remands for a “fresh start” (`Paramountdivestiture.md`).

### 4J. “Consider intent” vs “power unexercised is illegal” — tension?

Two ideas pull against each other:
- “Intent” sounds subjective.
- “Power to exclude” sounds objective and can violate §2 even if unused (if coupled with intent to use it) (`Paramountdivestiture.md`).

Reconciliation move: intent is often inferred from structure + history:
- if the structure creates exclusion power and the record shows it was used to restrain trade, the Court treats that as potent evidence of intent.

### 4K. Is the analysis economically sophisticated (vs Hanssen)?

The Court’s approach here is closer to “structure + capability” than to a transaction-cost story.

**Hanssen article: [SOURCE NEEDED]** (not found in the Class 17 folder). Using past outline summaries:
- Hanssen is used to motivate an **efficiency** account of VI (reducing haggling and enabling flexible adjustment in response to demand uncertainty) (`Deals_Spring 2024...Kira Nash...docx.md`).
- That pushes against treating VI as inherently suspect.

### 4L. Antitrust suits vs new competitors — what platform was emerging?

**Television** in the late 1940s.

## 5. Can vertical integration be anti-competitive? (and when is it efficient?)

### 5A. Why would producers want to limit the number of movies?

Limiting output can raise profits if:
- movies compete for the same limited consumer attention/screen time,
- the marginal movie cannibalizes revenue from higher-margin films,
- scarcity strengthens bargaining leverage with exhibitors.

### 5B. Five studios; “limit to 250” deal; should you honor if others do?

**YES.** If everyone credibly sticks to 50 each, you earn cartel rents: higher price/margins than in a competitive output race.

### 5C. If you can secretly make five extra movies, should you cheat; what does that imply?

**YES.** Cheating is individually rational:
- you capture extra profit while others keep supply tight.

Implication: the agreement is unstable without:
- monitoring (detect cheating), and
- enforcement (punish cheating).

### 5D. If each studio owns some theaters and outsiders don’t, does that help monitoring/enforcement?

**Easier.** Theater ownership creates:
- better **information** about what is being shown and how often,
- leverage to **punish** cheaters (deny screens, change terms, retaliate through booking),
- repeat-play channels where retaliation is credible.

### 5E. “Owning theaters lets you keep new studios out” — true/false?

**True (often).** Owning enough premium screens can:
- reduce access for independents (especially first-run),
- lower the expected returns to entrants (raising entry barriers),
- support market power upstream (production/distribution) via foreclosure.

The exact force depends on whether independents can access alternative exhibition at comparable scale/quality.

### 5F. Sixth independent studio makes a “big draw” film — why refuse vs exhibit?

Refuse incentives:
- protect cartel discipline: don’t reward an outsider that breaks the output limit.
- protect your own slate: keep screens for your own films (and your integrated partners).
- protect bargaining power: denying access can force the independent to sell/partner on worse terms.

Exhibit incentives:
- short-run profit: a hit fills seats now.
- reputational/consumer pressure: theaters need attractive product.
- competitive dynamics: if you refuse, a rival theater/studio may grab the hit and win customers.

This is the standard tradeoff between cartel enforcement and immediate gains.

### 5G. What is a horizontal merger; why is output restriction more intuitive there?

**Horizontal merger** = firms at the same stage combine (e.g., two studios merge).

It is easier to see output restriction because:
- fewer competitors → easier coordination,
- merged firm internalizes the pricing/output externality directly.

### 5H. Hart & Tirole: “vertical merger doesn’t change market shares” — explain

If an upstream firm has 10% and a downstream firm has 10%, merging them:
- doesn’t mechanically increase either’s share in the upstream or downstream market;
- rivals still hold the remaining 90% in each market.

So the simple “concentration goes up” story is weaker for VI than for horizontal mergers.

### 5I. Hart & Tirole “market forfeiture”: why does integration help leverage power across markets?

Core point: integration improves **profit-sharing and control**, which can make exclusion strategies workable.

If separate, an upstream and downstream firm trying to act like a single monopolist face contracting problems:
- transfer prices can be gamed,
- “profits” can be shifted/misreported (each side claims low margins),
- side payments are hard to verify and enforce.

With integration:
- cash flows are internal; accounting games are less relevant,
- the combined firm can credibly sacrifice margin in one unit to win in another (because it captures total profit),
- foreclosure strategies are easier to execute and police.

### 5J. Could lower studio-era actor salaries be caused by anticompetitive effects of VI?

**Yes, via buyer power + reduced outside options.** VI can contribute to wage suppression if:
- integrated studios control enough exhibition/distribution to limit alternative paths to audiences,
- exclusive dealing (studio contracts) reduces cross-studio bidding for talent,
- studios can coordinate informally on “not poaching” (monitoring is easier with repeat play + shared distribution practices).

The competing explanation is efficiency/risk-sharing: salary + long-term contract can be a financing/insurance device for talent. The question is whether exclusivity and market structure pushed wages below competitive levels.

## Key Takeaways

1. **The antitrust case against VI is strongest when one stage is a bottleneck** (first-run screens) and VI supports foreclosure or cartel enforcement.
2. **The efficiency case for VI is strongest when contracts are incomplete** (demand uncertainty; hard-to-verify performance; need fast, flexible reallocation).
3. In *Paramount*, the Court’s test is explicitly **not per se**, but it treats **structure + exclusion capability** as powerful evidence of unlawful purpose/power.

## Notes for Class Discussion (what to have ready)

- Numbers to cite from *Paramount*: **~17% of theaters**, **~45% of rentals**, **~70% of first-run in big cities** (`Paramountdivestiture.md`).
- One clean sentence definition each for **production / distribution / exhibition**.
- One clean sentence on **why VI can be efficient** (reduces haggling + enables fast adjustments) and on **why it can be anticompetitive** (foreclosure + cartel support).
