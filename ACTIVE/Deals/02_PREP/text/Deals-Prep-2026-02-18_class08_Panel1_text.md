# Class 8 Prep Sheet: Venture Capital — Capital Structure, Incentive Compensation & Tax Planning

**Course:** Deals  
**Topic:** VC Capital: Capital Structure, Incentive Compensation, and Tax Planning (Panel 1)  
**Date:** Spring Semester 2026  

---

## Key Concepts Overview

This class connects three recurring “Deals” themes—**information asymmetry**, **agency costs**, and **uncertainty**—to how VCs finance startups *and* to a major reason that the standard VC instrument in the U.S. is **convertible preferred stock**: **tax planning through valuation**.

### 1) Two types of income (and why everyone cares)

- **Ordinary income**: compensation for services (top federal rate used in the packet: **37%**).
- **Capital gain**: profit from selling an investment (top federal rate used in the packet: **23.8%**).

**Key tax planning goal:** shift as much of the founder/manager’s upside as possible from **ordinary income** to **capital gain**, and also **defer** tax until liquidity.

### 2) The basic VC “two-tier” capital structure

| Stakeholder | Typical security | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Founders/employees | **Common stock** (often restricted) and/or options | High-powered incentives; most upside |
| Venture capitalists | **Convertible preferred** | Downside protection + upside via conversion; control rights; supports tax valuation strategy |

### 3) Why convertible preferred is so common (high-level)

Convertible preferred can plausibly be justified economically (and is often discussed that way), but the key G&S point is: many “preferences” are **often not very valuable** in startups, except in specific scenarios—yet the structure persists because it helps with **valuation-based tax planning**:

- **Dividend preference**: usually not meaningful because startups rarely pay dividends pre-exit.
- **Liquidation preference**: often not meaningful in a true failure (few assets left), but can matter in a **“zombie” sale**.
- **Control rights**: economically significant, but can be replicated via contracts (board seats, vetoes, covenants).
- **Tax/valuation**: issuing VCs a *different* (senior) security helps justify a **low tax valuation** for common stock issued to founders/employees near the financing round, supporting **83(b)** planning and similar strategies.

### 4) The “zombie” scenario (the place liquidation preference bites)

**Zombie** = the company isn’t a home run or a zero; it’s “going sideways” and gets sold for enough to return something, but not enough to make common happy.

- In a zombie sale, a **1x liquidation preference** can give VCs most of the proceeds (especially if the preferred is **participating**).
- This can create **investor vs. founder conflicts** on exit decisions (sale now vs. keep building).

## Question 1: Background — Two Types of Income

### A. Two types of income; which do taxpayers prefer?

**Ordinary income** vs. **capital gain**.  
**Taxpayers usually prefer: CAPITAL GAIN.**

Why:
- Lower rate (23.8% vs. 37% in the packet).
- Often taxed later (on sale), so **deferral**.

### B. Income from performing services is usually classified as…?

**Ordinary income.**

Includes: wages, bonuses, most non-cash compensation (valued at FMV).

### C. Gains from selling a profitable investment?

**Capital gain** (assuming you’re selling a capital asset and you satisfy holding period rules for long-term treatment).

### D. Ann builds her own business; stock doubles; she sells to private equity. Ordinary or capital?

**CAPITAL GAIN** (the classic “build value, then sell the equity” pattern).

Nuance to keep in mind for class:
- The system draws a line between **labor return** (ordinary) and **investment return** (capital).
- Tax planners spend their lives arguing about which side of the line a fact pattern really belongs on.

### E. Ann runs Barbara’s business; gets a “generous bonus.” Ordinary or capital?

**ORDINARY INCOME.**

Reason:
- It’s payment for services, not investment appreciation.

## Question 2: Compare Common, Plain-Vanilla Preferred, Convertible Preferred

### A. If the company does really well, what would you rather have?

**COMMON (or CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED THAT YOU CAN/WILL CONVERT).**

- Common is the **residual claimant**: unlimited upside.
- Convertible preferred is attractive because you can convert into common to capture upside.
- Plain preferred often has capped upside (unless participating or otherwise structured).

### B. If the business does badly?

**PREFERRED (PLAIN OR CONVERTIBLE) over COMMON.**

Why:
- **Liquidation preference** puts you ahead of common in downside outcomes.

### C. Will they have the same voting/control rights?

**NO.**

Typical pattern:
- **Common**: standard voting rights (founders often hold it).
- **Preferred**: negotiated control features (board seats, protective provisions, vetoes), especially in VC deals.
- **Convertible preferred**: often has strong control rights pre-exit and converts (sometimes automatically) at IPO.

---

## Question 3: P&S Raises $500M for Acquisition — Why Not Common? Why Preferred? Why Convertible?

### A. Why might Bill hesitate to recommend common after negative press?

**Adverse selection / mispricing risk (equity issuance signals).**

If the market is skeptical:
- Issuing common at a depressed price **dilutes existing shareholders**.
- The act of issuing equity can be read as: “management thinks our stock is overvalued” (classic signaling logic).
- With uncertainty about the deal, common bears the most valuation sensitivity.

### B. If P&S issues plain-vanilla preferred (3% dividend + liquidation preference) and the acquisition goes badly, how do preferred holders do vs. common?

**Preferred does better than common on the downside.**

- Preferred has a prior claim (after debt) up to its preference amount.
- Common is last in line and absorbs losses first.

### C. If the acquisition goes well, how does preferred’s return compare with common?

**Preferred likely underperforms common in the upside scenario.**

Why:
- Preferred’s payoff is more “fixed” (dividend + preference) unless it has participation/conversion.
- Common captures the upside of successful synergy/growth.

### D. Why recommend convertible preferred instead (lower dividend, liquidation pref only if no conversion, .9 conversion ratio)?

**Because it offers a better risk/return tradeoff under uncertainty.**

Convertible preferred can:
- Protect investors on the downside (don’t convert; keep preference).
- Let investors participate in upside (convert when it’s good).
- Reduce the need to pay a high cash dividend now (which can be costly/undesirable).

## Question 4: Carl’s Startup — Incentives, Signaling, and Control

### A. Carl demands $300k salary and offers you 100% of equity. Incentive + signal?

**Incentive:** weak incentive to maximize upside (he gets paid the same either way).  
**Signal:** low confidence (or at least unwillingness to bear risk).

Why it’s problematic:
- If Carl has no equity, he can be tempted to:
  - avoid hard/high-effort paths,
  - “coast” or treat it like a job,
  - take overly safe strategies that protect his salary rather than maximize value.

### B. Carl takes $75k salary but wants 51% equity. Incentive + signal?

**Incentive:** very strong incentive to succeed (he owns the upside).  
**Signal:** higher confidence (willing to “bet on himself”).

This is the VC-style package:
- Low cash (conserves runway; reduces burn).
- High equity (high-powered incentives).

### C. Why be concerned about giving Carl 51% of voting common?

**Agency/control risk for the investors.**

With 51% voting control, Carl could:
- block an investor-friendly financing or sale,
- set his own compensation/related-party transactions (subject to fiduciary constraints, but still a problem),
- entrench himself (harder to replace management if needed),
- force strategy choices that benefit him but not investors.

### D. Can we give investors control early, but give Carl control once it “works”? Preferred stock route and non-preferred route?

**YES.**

**Using preferred stock:**
- Give investors **voting/board control** through preferred (board seats + protective provisions).
- Include a “control sunset” tied to success:
  - automatic conversion on a **qualified IPO**, or
  - conversion/termination of vetoes on hitting defined milestones/valuation thresholds.

**Without preferred stock:**
- Use **dual-class common** (high-vote vs. low-vote) and flip control on a trigger.
- Use a **stockholders’ agreement**:
  - board composition rules (investors control early; founder regains later),
  - protective provisions,
  - founder vesting/repurchase rights to manage entrenchment risk.

### E. Investors put in $2M; after 18 months another company wins; what is liquidation preference worth?

**Usually: not much.**

Reason:
- In a true failure, the startup has spent the cash on salaries/rent/computers (“burn”).
- There often aren’t meaningful liquidation assets left after creditors.

### F. Compare liquidation preference in Carl’s startup vs. P&S (consumer products company)

**Liquidation preference is usually less meaningful in the startup than at P&S.**

Why:
- P&S likely has tangible assets, cash flows, and going-concern value.
- Startups often have few assets besides people/ideas; liquidation value can be close to zero.

## Question 5: G&S — Economic Significance of Convertible Preferred Terms

### A. Dividend preferences; how significant in VC-backed firms?

**Dividend preference** = preferred must be paid dividends before common can be paid.

**Significance in VC startups: LOW.**

Why:
- Startups typically reinvest cash and do not pay dividends pre-exit.
- Even “cumulative” dividends often don’t matter unless the company actually plans to pay dividends before conversion/exit.

### B. Liquidation preferences; how significant when the startup fails?

**Liquidation preference** = preferred gets paid first (after debt) up to a specified amount (often **1x**).

**Significance in failure: OFTEN LOW.**

Why:
- There may be little left to distribute after liabilities.

### C. How significant in a sale to another firm (the “zombie” scenario)?

**Significance: CAN BE HIGH.**

In a zombie sale:
- VCs may take their preference and leave relatively little for common.
- If preferred is **participating**, VCs can take the preference **and** then share in remaining proceeds, further squeezing common.

### D. How significant in an IPO?

**Significance: LOW (often zero).**

Why:
- Venture preferred often **automatically converts** to common upon a qualified IPO, eliminating the preference.

### E. Signaling: does convertible preferred push entrepreneurs to signal confidence?

**YES, that’s the argument (though it’s imperfect).**

The signaling story:
- If founders believe success is likely, they worry less about the downside carve-outs from preferences.
- Agreeing to investor-friendly preferred terms can therefore “signal” confidence/quality.

Why it’s imperfect:
- Founders may accept preferred terms because they have no better alternative (not necessarily confidence).
- VCs can price risk in other ways (valuation, staged financing, covenants), so the signal is noisy.

### F. Does convertible preferred motivate entrepreneurs to aim for an IPO (vs. sale)? Other reasons entrepreneurs prefer IPO?

**YES (at least plausibly).**

Mechanism:
- In an IPO, preferred typically converts to common, reducing the wedge created by preferences.
- In a sale—especially a zombie sale—preferences can sharply reduce founders’ proceeds, so founders have reason to push toward a high-value IPO outcome.

Other entrepreneur reasons to prefer an IPO:
- More **control** and prestige (and sometimes a path to regain control).
- Continued upside if they hold stock post-IPO.
- Liquidity (often staged) and a public “currency” for acquisitions/compensation.

### G. Does convertible preferred give VCs extra control rights? Does that explain ubiquity? Other ways?

**YES, VCs often get extra control rights—but this alone doesn’t fully explain ubiquity.**

Control rights commonly include:
- board seats,
- vetoes (“protective provisions”) over major actions (new financings, sale, charter changes),
- information rights and covenants.

But:
- Many of these can be replicated via **contracts** (investors’ rights agreements, voting agreements, stockholders’ agreements) even without preferred.
- That’s why G&S emphasize that **tax/valuation** likely plays a first-order role in the U.S.

## Question 6: Tax Planning — Equity Compensation, 83(b), and Valuation

### A. $300k cash to run the company: ordinary or capital gain?

**ORDINARY INCOME.**

### B. $200k cash + $100k gold bullion: what tax rate applies to the gold?

**ORDINARY INCOME (as compensation), valued at FMV when received.**

### C. $200k cash + $100k stock in 2021, vests in 2023, worth $500k in 2023 (no special elections): tax in 2021 and 2023?

**2021:** **$200,000 ordinary income** (cash). **$0** from the restricted stock (because it’s not yet vested).  
**2023:** **$500,000 ordinary income** upon vesting (FMV at vesting, assuming no purchase price).

Intuition:
- Without 83(b), the tax system waits until the employee’s right to the stock is no longer “substantial risk of forfeiture.”

### D. Same facts, but Ed makes an 83(b) election; then sells in 2023 at $500k: what is taxed when?

**2021:** **$300,000 ordinary income** ($200k cash + $100k stock at grant-date FMV).  
**2023 sale:** basis is $100k, sale price $500k → **$400,000 capital gain** (assuming holding period rules for long-term gain are satisfied).

### E. If Ed expects appreciation, does the 83(b) election increase or reduce his tax bill?

**Usually: REDUCE.**

Why:
- Pays ordinary tax on a lower value earlier.
- Converts later appreciation into capital gain taxed at a lower rate, and typically deferred until sale.

Key risk:
- If the stock never vests or drops in value, Ed can pay tax on value he never realizes.

### F. If Ed wants to reduce taxes, does he want to claim high or low value at receipt (with 83(b))?

**LOW value.**

Reason:
- Lower reported value → less ordinary income in the election year.

### G. If Frank (outside investor) pays $100k for identical shares, can Ed report a different value?

**Usually: NO.**

Reason:
- An arm’s-length price for the *same security* is powerful evidence of fair market value.

### H. Frank pays $100k for convertible preferred; Ed gets common. Must Ed still report $100k value?

**NO.**

This is the core structure:
- Frank’s preferred has senior rights (preference/control), so it can be valued higher.
- Ed’s common can be valued lower (sometimes aggressively) for tax purposes.

### I. If preferred isn’t actually worth much more economically than common, does the tax strategy still work?

**It can still “work” as a practical matter, but it’s conceptually fragile.**

The tension:
- **Economics:** preferred vs. common may not differ much in expected value (especially if dividends/liquidation are unlikely to matter).
- **Valuation practice (aggressive):** common is valued using a liquidation-type view where preferred takes almost everything in an immediate liquidation, pushing common’s value very low.

### J. If long-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary rates for >$1M earners, does this affect the strategy?

**YES — it reduces the upside of “conversion” for high earners.**

But even then:
- **Deferral** can still matter.
- Many taxpayers may still be below the threshold (and planning is still attractive to them).

## Question 7: “All Parties” in Tax Planning — Company Deduction and Why Startups Don’t Mind

### A. $10M revenue, $2M compensation, no other expenses: taxable income? Is compensation deductible?

Taxable income = $10M − $2M = **$8M**.  
**YES, compensation is tax-deductible** (to the company).

### B. If Ed reports a low value for the stock, does it affect the company’s deduction?

**YES.**

General rule:
- The company’s deduction usually tracks the employee’s **ordinary income** inclusion on compensatory equity.
- Lower valuation → lower employee ordinary income → lower company deduction.

### C. If the strategy costs the company deductions, why doesn’t the company block it in VC startups?

**Because the company often doesn’t care about deductions early on.**

Common VC-startup reasons:
- Startups often have **losses / NOLs** (no current tax to reduce).
- Deductions can be less valuable if they can’t be used soon (and may be limited later).
- The company is willing to “spend” deductions to recruit/retain talent by enabling employee tax advantages.

---

## Question 8: Subsidy Framing (G&S)

### A. What is the trigger for the “subsidy”?

**The venture financing structure that enables aggressive low valuations for common stock (and therefore lower taxes on incentive compensation).**

In other words:
- VC investment in a senior security can be the “hook” that makes the valuation story plausible (or at least arguable).
- The government effectively subsidizes startups by allowing founders/employees to pay less tax than they would under a more economically realistic valuation.

### B. “Skin in the game”: who else must invest? Would you include this feature?

For the government to subsidize through this mechanism, **private investors must put real money at risk** (the VC writes a check).

**Would we include it? YES (it’s a sensible screen).**

Why:
- Filters for ventures that pass some market test (someone sophisticated is willing to invest).
- Reduces pure waste/fraud risk because outsiders have incentives to monitor.

Potential downside:
- It favors ventures that can attract VC and may under-serve good ideas that don’t fit VC models.

## Question 9: Gamer Gail — Advising on Capital Structure, Rights, and Tax

### A. What capital structure should Gamer Gail have? What securities for GV and Gail?

**Recommended core structure:**

- **GV (the VC): Convertible preferred stock.**
  - Rationale: standard VC package (downside protection + upside + control + supports valuation-based tax planning).
- **Gail (founder/manager): Common stock (often restricted) + possible option pool for future hires.**
  - If Gail is receiving *additional* shares “for running the company,” those are functionally **incentive compensation**; the clean way is often restricted stock (with vesting) or options, with attention to tax timing (including 83(b) if eligible/appropriate).

Henry typically stays in **common** (unless he is also investing on VC-like terms).

### B. Given their deal: how should we allocate liquidation, dividends, and control? What matters economically?

**Liquidation (economically important mainly in downside/zombie outcomes):**
- Give GV a **1x** liquidation preference (common baseline).
- Decide whether it is **participating** (more investor-friendly; worse for founders in mid outcomes) or **non-participating** (more founder-friendly).

**Dividends (usually not economically significant):**
- Preferred dividend preference can be included but often won’t drive real payouts pre-exit.

**Control (economically significant):**
- Give GV board seats and protective provisions **until a success trigger** (e.g., qualified IPO).
- If Gail wants control back after success, build in a **sunset**:
  - automatic conversion at IPO and termination of protective provisions, and/or
  - staged reduction of control rights after performance milestones.

**What matters most in practice:**
- **Control rights** (monitoring and exit decisions).
- **Liquidation preference** in a zombie sale.
- Dividends are usually background noise.

### C. What tax advantages does this offer? Who benefits? Any offsetting tax disadvantages?

**Tax advantage (core G&S point):**
- Having GV buy **convertible preferred** helps justify a **lower valuation of common stock** issued to Gail (and employees) near the financing.
- That supports planning that shifts value into **capital gain** (and defers tax), especially when paired with **83(b)** elections for restricted stock.

**Who benefits:**
- Primarily **Gail and employees/management** (lower current ordinary income; more capital gain later).

**Offsetting disadvantage:**
- Potentially reduces the company’s compensation deduction (since employee ordinary income is lower).

**Does it matter here? Often not much.**
- Early-stage startups frequently don’t have taxable income, so deductions are less valuable in the near term.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Convertible preferred’s “preferences” often matter less than people think** in true failure and in IPO; the big bite is the **zombie sale**.
- **Control rights are central** in VC deals, but can be achieved in multiple legal forms (preferred, contracts, dual-class).
- **Tax planning through valuation** is a major reason the U.S. VC market standardizes around convertible preferred: it helps founders/employees justify **low common valuations** and shift returns toward **capital gain** (often via **83(b)** timing).
- Always ask: **who bears the tax cost** (employee vs. company) and **does the company care** (NOLs and early losses often mean “no”).

---

## Notes for Class Discussion

- Keep the “three core problems” in view for each question: **information asymmetry**, **agency costs**, **uncertainty**—then ask what the term/structure is *doing* to solve one of them.
- When talking liquidation preference, distinguish: **failure liquidation** vs. **zombie sale** vs. **IPO** (the answer changes).
- For tax questions, force yourself to say out loud:
  - **What is the tax event?** (grant? vest? exercise? sale?)
  - **What is the character?** (ordinary vs. capital?)
  - **Why does valuation matter here?**
- On “subsidy,” be ready to argue both sides:
  - pro: screens with private capital + monitoring,
  - con: favors VC-accessible ventures and relies on aggressive valuation conventions.
