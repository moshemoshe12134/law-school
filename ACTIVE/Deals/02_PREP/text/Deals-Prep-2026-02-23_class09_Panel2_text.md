# Class 9 Prep Sheet: Nonprofits — Like Venture Capital (Organization as a Substitute for Contract)

**Course:** Deals  
**Topic:** Asymmetric Information, Incentives, and the Nonprofit Form (Panel 2)  
**Date:** 2026-03-18

---

## Key Concepts Overview

This class treats **nonprofits as a deal structure** for solving the course’s two recurring problems:

1. **Information problems** (especially “contract failure”): consumers/donors can’t reliably evaluate quality, delivery, or impact.
2. **Incentive problems** (externalities/public goods): markets under-produce socially valuable goods because benefits aren’t fully priced (free riding).

The nonprofit “tool” is the **nondistribution constraint**: the organization can earn a surplus, but **control persons cannot take it as dividends**. That constraint is supposed to make donors/beneficiaries more willing to trust the organization when monitoring is hard.

Three nonprofit-specific information problems to keep straight:
- **Expertise:** the buyer can’t evaluate whether the service is needed or good.
- **Personal contact:** the payer isn’t the consumer and can’t monitor quality/delivery.
- **Impact:** even if you can see the service, you can’t tell the **marginal effect** of your contribution.

Nonprofits also show up as a response to **public goods** and **externalities**, often paired with **tax subsidy** (entity-level exemption + donor deduction).

## Question 1: Review — Information Problems in High‑Tech Startups

### A. If Arlene pitches average investors, can they evaluate her AI idea?

**NO (not effectively).** This is classic **information asymmetry**: the founder knows far more than outsiders, and the outsiders may not have the expertise to evaluate technical claims.

### B. Could you draft a detailed contract specifying what Arlene must do at each stage?

**NO (not in a useful way).**
- The work is uncertain and iterative; you don’t know ex ante what steps will be optimal.
- A hyper-detailed contract is expensive to draft and quickly becomes obsolete.
- Over‑specification can also **reduce innovation** by locking the founder into the wrong path.

### C. True/False: VC uses organizations as a substitute for detailed contracts.

**TRUE.** VC “contracts” heavily through **structure**: staged financing, control rights, board composition, covenants, and incentive compensation (equity) that make monitoring/discipline feasible despite uncertainty and asymmetric information.

---

## Question 2: Structuring at Nonprofits — The Nondistribution Constraint

### A. True/False: Nonprofits use organizational structure to solve information/incentive problems.

**TRUE.** Nonprofits use a different structure than VC, but the same move: **use the organization’s design** to mitigate problems that a pure contract can’t solve.

### B. What is the nondistribution constraint?

**Nondistribution constraint:** the nonprofit cannot distribute “net earnings” to control persons (members/officers/directors/trustees). The surplus must be retained for the mission, not paid out like dividends.

### C. Are nonprofits barred from earning a profit?

**NO.** Nonprofits can run a **surplus**. The point is **no distribution** of that surplus to control persons.

---

## Question 3: Hansmann — Why Nonprofits?

### A. What problem is Hansmann invoking? Connection to course themes?

**Information asymmetry (“contract failure”).** Consumers/donors sometimes can’t evaluate whether the promised quality was delivered, so ordinary market discipline breaks.

This is the course theme: when direct contracting/monitoring fails, parties look for **structures** that change incentives and make trust rational.

### B. Why is the nondistribution constraint a potential solution?

Because it **weakens the manager’s profit motive** to exploit the information gap.
- If managers can’t pocket the residual, donors/consumers are less worried the organization will cut quality, overcharge, or misrepresent services.
- The constraint is not perfect, but it can **reduce the expected payoff from cheating**.

## Question 4: First Information Problem — Expertise

### A. Ben + surgeon: can Ben evaluate the diagnosis?

**NO.** Ben lacks expertise; this is a “credence good” problem (even after the service, quality/need can be hard to judge).

### B. Does this help explain why elite hospitals tend to be nonprofits?

**YES.** When patients can’t evaluate necessity/quality, the nonprofit form (via nondistribution constraint) can credibly signal **less incentive to exploit** the information gap.

### C. Chris + mechanic: can Chris evaluate the need for repair? Are auto shops nonprofits?

**He also can’t evaluate the diagnosis well**, but auto repair tends to be **for‑profit** because:
- Outcomes are often more **observable** (car starts/doesn’t; repeated interactions; warranties).
- Reputation/competition can discipline quality more effectively than in complex medical care.

### D. Debbie + lawyer: can she evaluate recommended contract terms? Do lawyers work for nonprofits?

**She can’t evaluate well**, but most lawyers work for **for‑profit** firms because:
- Reputation, repeat‑play, and professional constraints can do a lot of the disciplining work.
- Some legal services are nonprofit (legal aid), but the market is not organized primarily as nonprofit.

## Question 5: Second Information Problem — Personal Contact

### A. Flowers for mom (Elizabeth in NY; mom in Chicago): nonprofit or for‑profit?

**For‑profit.** Even if Elizabeth can’t inspect the flowers herself, she has **a monitor** (her mother) who can report quality, so ordinary market discipline works reasonably well.

### B. Earthquake relief donation (Gail in NY; relief in Asia): nonprofit or for‑profit?

**Nonprofit.** Gail has no reliable personal monitor and faces a large information gap about delivery/quality. The nonprofit form (plus disclosure norms) helps reassure her the money will be used for the mission.

### C. How is Gail’s problem different from Ben/Chris/Debbie in Q4?

Gail is the **payer who is not the consumer**. Ben/Chris/Debbie directly receive the service (still hard to evaluate), but Gail has less direct feedback and weaker ability to discipline the provider.

### D. Could technology change this?

**YES.** Better tracking, audits, photos/video, third‑party ratings, and real‑time reporting can reduce (not eliminate) the monitoring gap.

---

## Question 6: Third Information Problem — Impact

### A. Riverside Park donor (Ilene): same challenge as Gail?

**NO (smaller).** Ilene can personally observe the park’s quality and maintenance more directly than Gail can observe disaster relief.

### B. Different information problem: does her donation “make a difference”?

**YES.** Even if she can observe outcomes, she still faces the **marginal impact** problem:
- Would the park have been maintained anyway?
- Did her donation add maintenance, accelerate it, or just replace other funding?

The nonprofit form can help (imperfectly) by reducing fear of skimming and by enabling reporting/commitment about use of funds.

## Question 7: Review — Two kinds of problems

One is **information**. The other is **incentives**.

---

## Question 8: Externalities, Incentives, and Public Goods

### A. Wood stove smoke into Helen’s window

#### i. Do Jane and Ilene consider impact on Helen?

**NO.**

#### ii. What is an externality? Positive or negative here?

**Externality:** a transaction affects a third party and the transacting parties don’t internalize that effect.

Here it is a **negative externality** (harm imposed on Helen).

#### iii. True/False: externalities create flawed incentives.

**TRUE.** Negative externalities lead to “too much” of the activity; positive externalities lead to “too little.”

### B. Mosquito spraying on shared road

#### i–ii. If one sprays, does the other benefit?

**YES** to both. Each person’s spraying benefits the other.

#### iii. Effect on incentives?

This creates **under‑investment**: each hopes the other pays/acts.

#### iv. What is free riding?

**Free riding:** benefiting from someone else’s effort/payment without contributing, leading to under‑provision of the activity.

#### v. Is a mosquito‑free neighborhood a public good?

**YES (a local public good).** It is non‑rival within the neighborhood and hard to exclude non‑payers.

---

## Question 9: Social Value and Externalities

### A. Do nonprofits have significant social value?

**YES.** That is the point of the sector.

### B. Do nonprofits generate externalities?

**YES.** Many nonprofit outputs create spillover benefits beyond the donor/beneficiary pair.

### C. Do tech startups generate externalities? Same extent?

**YES, but often less directly.** Innovation can spill over, but for‑profit models can also internalize a lot of value through pricing/IP.

### D. True/False: nonprofits and government subsidies address externalities (incentive problems).

**TRUE.** The core idea is correcting incentive failures where markets won’t supply the socially optimal level of an activity (often because of externalities/public goods/free riding).

---

## Question 10: Nonprofits as a Response to Public Goods

### A. Mary’s climate research organization: public good? positive externalities?

**YES.** Knowledge is typically **non‑rival** and hard to exclude; it generates **positive externalities**.

### B. Should it be nonprofit or for‑profit?

**Nonprofit (default answer).**
- It’s hard to charge everyone who benefits, so markets under‑fund it.
- A nonprofit can aggregate donations/subsidies to produce the public good.

### C. Mary works there (mission‑driven) vs Nick’s data entry job: how will she feel?

Mary is likely to have **higher intrinsic motivation** and satisfaction because her work is tied to a mission she values.

### D. Comparative advantage nonprofits sometimes have over for‑profits?

**Workforce advantage:** nonprofits can attract and retain mission‑aligned labor (sometimes at lower cash compensation) because people value the mission.

---

## Question 11: Tax Subsidy

### A. Does Mary’s nonprofit pay tax on surplus? What about the widget manufacturer?

**Nonprofit: generally NO.**  
**For‑profit: generally YES.**

### B. Olivia donates $10,000: what tax benefit can she claim?

**A charitable deduction** (simplified model): reduce taxable income by $10,000.

### C. If Olivia’s marginal tax rate is 50%, what is the real financial cost?

Tax savings: $10,000 × 50% = **$5,000**  
Net cost: $10,000 − $5,000 = **$5,000**

---

## Question 12: Governments vs Nonprofits; “Double Utility of Giving”

### A. Social Security: who has comparative advantage? What are economies of scale?

**Government (comparative advantage).**
- **Economies of scale:** average cost per person falls as the program scales.
- Government can tax, pool risk, and run massive programs cheaply per capita.

### B. Clean needle programs: government or nonprofits first? Why?

**Nonprofits first (typical pattern).** Nonprofits can experiment and take on politically controversial interventions with less political constraint than government agencies.

### C. Social movements (civil rights; women’s rights; gay rights; environmental): where did they begin?

**In nonprofits/civil society first.** Nonprofits can build coalitions and advocate before there is majority support for government action.

### D. Double utility of giving

#### i–ii. Does a birthday gift make Peter happier? Rachel happier?

**TRUE** and **TRUE.**

#### iii. What is “double utility of giving”?

**Double utility:** the recipient gains utility and the giver also gains utility from voluntary giving.

#### iv. Taxes: double utility?

**Generally NO.** Taxes are mandatory, so the “giver utility” is weaker and not the same voluntary satisfaction.

#### v. Charity donation: double utility?

**YES.** The donor gets satisfaction from giving (plus the recipient/beneficiaries gain).

## Key Takeaways

- Nonprofits are an **organizational response** to (1) hard‑to‑monitor quality/impact and (2) incentive failures like public goods/free riding.
- The **nondistribution constraint** is the key structural tool: it limits (not eliminates) extraction.
- Keep the three information problems separate: **expertise**, **personal contact**, **impact**.
- Subsidies (entity exemption + donor deductions) are a policy tool to help fund activities with **spillover benefits**.

---

## Notes for Class Discussion

- Start answers with the type of problem: **information** (expertise/contact/impact) vs **incentives** (externalities/public goods).
- Then state the mechanism: **nondistribution constraint**, disclosure, third‑party monitoring, or subsidies.
- Always ask: “What’s observable here?” and “Who is actually monitoring?”
