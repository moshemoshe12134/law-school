# Class 9 Prep Sheet: Nonprofits - Like Venture Capital, Asymmetric Information and Organization as a Substitute for Contract

**Course:** Deals
**Topic:** Nonprofit Organizations: Asymmetric Information, Externalities, and Public Goods
**Date:** Spring Semester 2026
**Panel:** Panel 2

---

## Key Concepts Overview

This class explores how **nonprofit organizations** address information and incentive problems that for-profit firms can't handle well. We're applying the same tools we used for venture capital to a completely different sector.

Key themes include:

- **Nondistribution constraint** - the defining feature of nonprofits (no profits to insiders)
- **Asymmetric information** - when consumers can't evaluate quality (expertise services, personal contact, impact measurement)
- **Externalities** - positive and negative effects on third parties not involved in transactions
- **Public goods** - goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous
- **Free riding** - when people benefit without paying
- **Tax subsidies** - how the government supports nonprofits through tax exemptions and deductions
- **Double utility of giving** - why people give to charities vs. pay taxes
- **Nonprofits vs. government** - comparative advantages in addressing market failures

**The core insight:** Nonprofits are an organizational form that solves specific types of market failures - particularly where consumers can't judge quality, where positive externalities are significant, and where trust matters most. The nondistribution constraint commits the organization to mission over profit.

## Question 1: Review - Information Problems in High-Tech Startups

### A. Arlene's AI Pitch

**Can average investors effectively evaluate Arlene's AI idea? NO.**

This is a classic **asymmetric information** problem:
- Arlene (the engineer) has technical expertise
- Average investors lack the knowledge to judge whether her approach is viable
- She could be exaggerating or the idea could be technically infeasible
- Investors would need to hire experts to evaluate her - which is costly

**This is why venture capital exists as a specialized sector:**
- VCs develop expertise in evaluating tech startups
- They see many deals and can make comparative judgments
- They use staged financing to address ongoing information problems
- They structure deals (board seats, vetoes, etc.) to monitor founders

### B. Contracting for AI Development

**Would it be easy to draft a detailed contract for Arlene's work? NO.**

**Why not?**
- Innovation is unpredictable - we don't know what Arlene will discover
- You can't contract for "breakthroughs" or specific innovations
- Measuring effort vs. outcome is difficult
- The path to success isn't known in advance

**This is the "incomplete contracting" problem:**
- No contract can specify every contingency in R&D
- You can't write: "If X happens, do Y" because X is unknown
- Future states of the world are too numerous to anticipate

### C. Organizations as a Substitute for Contract

**TRUE.** The VC industry uses organizational structure, not detailed contracts, to solve information problems:

- **Staged financing** - VCs invest incrementally as milestones are reached
- **Board control** - VCs get board seats to monitor and make decisions
- **Veto rights** - VCs can block major decisions (sale, new funding, etc.)
- **Liquidation preference** - VCs get paid first in a sale
- **Founder vesting** - Founders earn equity over time (can't walk away)

**The organization itself (the startup corporation + VC governance) is the solution.**

---

## Question 2: Structuring as a Substitute for Contract at Nonprofits

### A. Nonprofits Use Organizational Structure Too

**TRUE.** Just as VC solves problems through organizational structure, nonprofits solve problems through a different structure - the nondistribution constraint.

### B. The Nondistribution Constraint - Definition

**The nondistribution constraint** means that nonprofits cannot distribute any profits or net earnings to the people who control them (board members, officers, directors, trustees).

**Key points:**
- Net earnings = earnings in excess of what's needed to pay for services rendered
- The organization CAN earn a profit (revenue > expenses)
- But that profit must stay in the organization, not go to insiders
- Profits must be reinvested in the organization's mission

**This is a LEGAL constraint, not just a policy choice.**

### C. Can Nonprofits Earn a Profit?

**YES - nonprofits can and do earn profits.**

**What they can't do:** Distribute those profits to insiders

**What they can do with profits:**
- Reinvest in programs
- Build reserves
- Expand services
- Pay higher salaries (within reason)
- Improve facilities

**Example:** A hospital that's nonprofit can charge more than its costs and run a surplus. But it can't pay that surplus to the hospital CEO or board members as bonuses or dividends.

## Question 3: Hansmann's Explanation - Information Problems

### A. What Problem is Hansmann Invoking?

**Asymmetric information** - consumers can't accurately evaluate goods or services.

**How it connects to the course:**
- This is the same problem we've seen all semester
- VCs face it with startups
- Acquirers face it with target companies
- Consumers face it with certain services
- Nonprofits are ANOTHER tool in the toolkit for addressing it

### B. Why Nonprofits Help - The Nondistribution Constraint as Solution

**The logic:**
1. In for-profit firms, owners have incentive to cut quality when consumers can't evaluate it
2. If consumers can't tell the difference between good and bad service, profit-maximizing firms will cut corners
3. This is the "lemons problem" - bad quality drives out good quality
4. Nonprofits commit to quality by pledging NOT to distribute profits
5. The nondistribution constraint signals: "We're not here to extract money; we're here to serve the mission"

**Why it works:**
- Removes the profit incentive to cut quality
- Creates trust: consumers know the organization isn't trying to exploit them
- Board members and directors can't personally benefit from cutting corners
- Any surplus must be reinvested, not taken as profit

---

## Question 4: First Type of Information Problem - Expertise

### A. Ben's Back Pain - Medical Care

**i. Can Ben evaluate the surgeon's diagnosis? NOT EFFECTIVELY.**

This is a severe asymmetric information problem:
- Ben has no medical training
- The surgeon has years of specialized expertise
- Ben can't tell if surgery is truly necessary or if the surgeon is recommending it for financial reasons
- Getting a second opinion helps but doesn't eliminate the problem (doctors may tend to defer to each other)

**ii. Why are prestigious hospitals often nonprofits?**

The nonprofit form signals commitment to patient care over profit:
- Patients can't evaluate medical quality
- For-profit hospitals might have incentive to over-treat (more procedures = more revenue)
- Nonprofit hospitals commit (via nondistribution constraint) to prioritizing patients
- Trust is essential in healthcare - nonprofit form builds trust

### B. Chris's Car - Auto Repair

**i. Can Chris evaluate the mechanic's recommendation? SOMEWHAT, BUT NOT PERFECTLY.**

- Chris lacks specialized knowledge
- But cars are more understandable than human bodies
- Chris can get multiple quotes
- Chris can research online
- The consequences of bad advice are usually financial, not life-threatening

**ii. Are auto repair shops nonprofits or for-profit? OVERWHELMINGLY FOR-PROFIT.**

Why the difference from medicine?
- **Lower stakes:** A bad repair costs money; bad medical care can kill you
- **More evaluable:** Cars are more understandable than bodies
- **Repeat business:** You use the same mechanic repeatedly; they value reputation
- **Competition works:** Multiple shops can compete, keeping prices reasonable
- **Lower information asymmetry:** Consumers can better judge auto quality

### C. Debbie's Lawyer - Real Estate Closing

**i. Can Debbie evaluate the lawyer's recommendations? NOT VERY EFFECTIVELY.**

- Debbie has no legal training
- Real estate contracts are complex
- She doesn't know which terms are standard vs. unusual
- She can't tell if the lawyer is recommending unnecessary work

**ii. Are most lawyers nonprofits or for-profit? OVERWHELMINGLY FOR-PROFIT.**

This seems inconsistent with the expertise hypothesis! Why?

**Possible explanations:**
- **Repeat business:** Clients use lawyers repeatedly; reputation matters
- **Market competition:** Many lawyers to choose from
- **Referral networks:** Clients rely on trusted referrals
- **Legal ethics:** Bar association rules impose some constraints on exploitation
- **Some legal services ARE nonprofits:** Legal aid, public defender, nonprofit law clinics

---

## Question 5: Second Type of Information Problem - Personal Contact

### A. Elizabeth's Flowers for Her Mother

**i. Is Elizabeth likely to buy from a nonprofit or for-profit? ALMOST CERTAINLY FOR-PROFIT.**

**Why?**
- Elizabeth can SEE the flowers (or photos online)
- She can evaluate quality directly
- Feedback is immediate - her mother will tell her if the flowers were bad
- Reputation systems (Yelp, Google Reviews) work well
- The florist has incentive to do good work for repeat and referral business
- The information problem is minimal

**The nonprofit form is unnecessary here because consumers CAN evaluate quality.**

### B. Gail's Earthquake Relief Donation

**i. Is Gail likely to contribute to a nonprofit or for-profit? ALMOST CERTAINLY NONPROFIT.**

**Why?**
- Gail has NO direct way to evaluate whether her money actually helps earthquake victims
- A for-profit firm might pocket most of the money as "overhead" or profit
- The nonprofit form signals commitment to the mission
- The nondistribution constraint means her money can't be taken as profit by insiders

**ii. How is Gail's problem different from Ben/Chris/Debbie?**

Ben/Chris/Debbie are **buying services for themselves**:
- They personally experience the quality
- They're the direct consumer
- Feedback is direct

Gail is **donating to help others**:
- She won't personally experience the "service"
- She's helping strangers in another country
- Feedback is indirect or nonexistent
- This is a donation, not a purchase - she gets nothing directly in return

**The personal contact problem is worse for donations because the donor has NO direct way to evaluate impact.**

**iii. Could technology change this? YES - in several ways:**

- **Direct communication:** Victims can post on social media about aid received
- **Tracking:** Some organizations now show where money goes (map-based tracking)
- **Crowdfunding:** Platforms like GoFundMe allow direct giving to individuals
- **Transparency:** Online reporting and ratings of charities

**But technology has limits:**
- Recipients might not have internet access in disaster zones
- Verification is still difficult
- Photos and stories can be faked
- The fundamental asymmetry remains

---

## Question 6: Third Type of Information Problem - Impact

### A. Ilene's Riverside Park Donation

**i. Does Ilene face the same challenge as Gail? SIMILAR, BUT NOT IDENTICAL.**

**Similarity:** Ilene can't perfectly track how her donation is used
**Difference:** Ilene personally uses the park and can see whether it's well-maintained

Ilene has MORE information than Gail:
- She spends time in the park
- She can see whether maintenance happens
- She can observe whether donations seem to make a difference

**ii. Does Ilene face a different information problem? YES - the "impact" problem.**

Even if Ilene sees the park is well-maintained, she doesn't know:
- Was HER donation necessary, or would others have given anyway?
- Did her donation make the difference between good and bad maintenance?
- What's the marginal impact of her contribution vs. someone else's?

**Can nonprofits help with this?**

Somewhat:
- Nonprofits can report on overall impact
- They can show how funds are used
- They can demonstrate what donations accomplish

**But the fundamental problem remains:**
- Individual donors can't know their specific impact
- This is why some people are reluctant to donate ("my small contribution won't matter")
- Nonprofits address this by aggregating small donations and showing collective impact

---

## Question 7: The Other "I" Problem

**The two problems this course emphasizes:**
1. **Information** - asymmetric information
2. **Incentives** - misaligned incentives

**Incentive problems** occur when one party's interests don't align with the other's:
- Employees may shirk when bosses can't monitor them
- Managers may pursue personal benefits rather than shareholder value
- Contractors may cut corners when clients can't verify quality

**Nonprofits address incentive problems through:**
- Nondistribution constraint (removes profit incentive)
- Mission-driven employees and board members
- Non-financial motivations (doing good, social impact)
- Different types of incentives (reputation, social recognition, personal fulfillment)

---

## Question 8: Externalities, Incentives, and Public Goods

### A. Ilene's Wood-Burning Stove

**i. When Ilene buys wood from Jane, do they consider Helen? NO.**

This is the classic externality problem:
- Ilene and Jane are the parties to the transaction
- Helen bears the cost (smoke in her home)
- Helen's welfare is not considered in the transaction
- Ilene and Jane have no incentive to consider Helen

**ii. What is an externality?**

An **externality** is a cost or benefit that affects a third party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit.

**In this example:**
- The smoke is a **negative externality** (harm to Helen)
- Ilene's transaction with Jane creates a cost for Helen
- Helen has no say in the transaction
- The market fails because the social cost exceeds the private cost

**iii. Externalities create flawed incentives - TRUE.**

**Why?**
- Ilene buys wood based on her private costs and benefits
- She doesn't bear the full social cost (Helen's suffering)
- Therefore, she has too much incentive to burn wood
- The market overproduces the harmful activity

**For negative externalities:**
- Parties don't have optimal incentives to avoid the costs
- The harmful activity is overproduced
- Government intervention (regulations, taxes) may be needed

**For positive externalities:**
- Parties don't capture the full benefits they create
- The beneficial activity is underproduced
- Government intervention (subsidies, public provision) may be needed

### B. The Mosquito Spraying Problem

**i. If Helen sprays, does Ilene benefit? YES** - free riding on Helen's effort

**ii. If Ilene sprays, does Helen benefit? YES** - free riding on Ilene's effort

**iii. What effect does this have on incentives? IT DESTROYS THEM.**

This is the classic **free rider problem**:
- Each person hopes the other will spray
- Each person benefits if the OTHER sprays, without paying themselves
- Result: Neither sprays, even though both would be better off if someone sprayed
- The beneficial activity is underproduced

**iv. What does "free riding" mean?**

**Free riding** occurs when someone benefits from a good or service without paying for it or contributing to its production.

**In this example:**
- If Helen sprays, Ilene gets the benefit (fewer mosquitoes) without paying
- If Ilene sprays, Helen gets the benefit without paying
- Both want to be the free rider, not the payer

**v. Is a mosquito-free neighborhood a public good? YES.**

**Economists' definition of public good:**
- **Non-excludable:** You can't prevent people from benefiting
- **Non-rivalrous:** One person's use doesn't reduce availability to others

**Mosquito-free neighborhood:**
- Non-excludable: You can't stop mosquitoes from avoiding everyone's property
- Non-rivalrous: Helen's enjoyment of fewer mosquitoes doesn't reduce Ilene's enjoyment
- Therefore, it's a public good

**Public goods tend to be underproduced by markets because:**
- People free ride on others' contributions
- Everyone hopes someone else will pay
- Private markets can't capture the full value

## Question 9: Externalities in Venture Capital and Nonprofits

### A. Does the nonprofit sector have social value? YES.**

Examples:
- Healthcare for underserved populations
- Education and research
- Arts and culture
- Environmental protection
- Poverty alleviation

### B. Do nonprofits generate externalities? YES - POSITIVE EXTERNALITIES.**

**Examples:**
- A well-educated population benefits everyone (lower crime, better civic engagement)
- Medical research benefits everyone, not just those who paid for it
- Environmental protection benefits everyone, including those who didn't donate
- Reduced poverty benefits everyone (less crime, more social stability)

### C. Do tech startups generate externalities? YES.**

**Examples:**
- New technologies create spillover benefits for other industries
- Successful startups inspire entrepreneurship
- Tech workers develop skills that benefit the whole economy
- New platforms enable new businesses (e.g., apps built on iOS)

**But to the same extent as nonprofits? GENERALLY NO.**

**Why?**
- For-profit startups capture more of the value they create through profits
- Patents allow them to exclude others from using their inventions
- Investors expect financial returns, which they capture
- Nonprofits by definition don't capture profits - value accrues to society

### D. Nonprofits and Government Subsidies Address Negative Externalities - TRUE.**

**Wait - that seems backwards. Nonprofits usually address POSITIVE externalities.**

**Re-reading:** The question says nonprofits address negative externalities. This might be referring to:
- Nonprofits address the NEGATIVE impact of market failures
- Government subsidies to nonprofits correct for underproduction (which is a negative externality problem)

**Better framing:** Nonprofits and their subsidies address POSITIVE externality problems (underproduction of beneficial activities).

---

## Question 10: Nonprofits as a Response to Public Goods

### A. Mary's Climate Change Research Organization

**i. Is the knowledge developed a public good? YES.**

- Knowledge is non-excludable (once known, it's hard to prevent others from using it)
- Knowledge is non-rivalrous (one person using knowledge doesn't reduce others' use)
- Climate research benefits everyone, not just those who pay for it

**ii. Does it have positive externalities? YES - ENORMOUS ONES.**

- Benefits people who didn't contribute
- Benefits future generations
- Benefits all of humanity
- The social value far exceeds what any single funder captures

### C. Should Mary's organization be nonprofit or for-profit? NONPROFIT.**

**Why nonprofit?**
- Donors/funders want their money used for research, not profit
- The nondistribution constraint signals commitment to the mission
- For-profit research might be skewed toward profitable findings, not public benefit
- Trust is essential - would you donate to a for-profit climate research org?

**But there's a complication:** For-profit companies DO conduct research (drug companies, tech companies). Why does that work?
- They can patent discoveries (making them excludable)
- They capture profits from commercial applications
- Public goods problem is addressed through patents

Climate research is different:
- Few patent opportunities (knowledge can't easily be owned)
- Benefits are diffuse and long-term
- No obvious commercial application for much of it

### D. Mary vs. Nick - Motivation

**Mary (nonprofit climate research) vs. Nick (widget manufacturing data entry)**

**How will their feelings about work compare?**

Mary will likely have:
- **Higher intrinsic motivation** - passionate about the mission
- **Higher job satisfaction** - feels work is meaningful
- **Willingness to work harder for less pay** - mission matters more than money
- **Greater sense of purpose** - working to save the planet

Nick will likely have:
- **Lower intrinsic motivation** - data entry for widgets is not meaningful work
- **Job is a paycheck** - work is just a means to income
- **Less willing to work extra without extra pay** - no mission to motivate
- **Boredom** - repetitive, unfulfilling work

### E. Nonprofits' Comparative Advantage

**Nonprofits can attract and motivate people who care about the mission.**

**This is a huge advantage:**
- Lower labor costs (people will work for less for a cause they believe in)
- Higher effort and dedication
- Lower turnover (people stay for the mission)
- Ability to attract volunteers (free labor!)
- Reputation and goodwill in the community

**For-profits can't match this for mission-driven work.**

---

## Question 11: Tax Subsidy

### A. Tax on Surplus

**Mary's nonprofit organization runs a surplus:**
- **NO tax on the surplus** - nonprofits are tax-exempt

**Widget manufacturer runs a surplus:**
- **YES, pays corporate income tax** on the surplus (profits)

**This is a significant subsidy to nonprofits:**
- They keep 100% of their surplus
- For-profits keep (1 - tax rate) of profits
- Assuming 21% corporate tax rate, for-profits keep 79%

### B. Olivia's $10,000 Donation

**What tax benefit can she claim?**

Olivia can deduct the $10,000 from her taxable income (assuming she itemizes deductions).

**This reduces her taxable income by $10,000.**

### C. Real Financial Cost of Olivia's Gift

**Without deduction:** Olivia is out $10,000

**With deduction:** Olivia saves $10,000 × her tax rate = $5,000
- **Real cost:** $10,000 - $5,000 = **$5,000**

**The government effectively pays half of Olivia's donation.**

**This is a massive subsidy to nonprofits:**
- Donations are cheaper for donors
- Encourages more giving
- Government shares the cost of private charity

---

## Question 12: Governments versus Nonprofits

### A. Social Security - Government or Nonprofit?

**i. Who has comparative advantage? GOVERNMENT.**

**Why government for Social Security?**
- **Economies of scale:** Huge program, cheaper to administer centrally
- **Universal coverage:** Government can ensure everyone is covered
- **Mandatory participation:** Government can require contributions (avoid free rider problem)
- **Stability:** Government can't go out of business
- **Ability to run deficits:** Government can borrow in ways nonprofits can't

**ii. What does "economies of scale" mean?**

**Economies of scale** occur when per-unit costs decrease as the scale of operation increases.

**For Social Security:**
- Administering $1 billion in benefits costs proportionally less than administering $1 million
- Fixed costs (computer systems, administration) are spread over more beneficiaries
- Larger scale allows more specialization and efficiency

**Yes, there are economies of scale in Social Security:**
- One centralized system is cheaper than thousands of nonprofit plans
- Standardized rules reduce administrative complexity
- Large-scale bargaining (with healthcare providers, etc.) lowers costs

### B. Clean Needle Programs

**Were these first administered by government or nonprofits? NONPROFITS.**

**Why nonprofits first?**
- **Controversial:** Needle exchange was politically controversial
- **Stigma:** Associated with drug use, which is stigmatized
- **Innovation:** Nonprofits are more nimble and can experiment
- **Local knowledge:** Nonprofits often closer to affected communities
- **Political risk:** Elected officials didn't want to be associated

**Government eventually got involved:**
- Once proven effective, government started funding
- Now many government-funded programs
- But nonprofits still often deliver services

### C. Social Movements

**Civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, environmental movements - where did they start? NONPROFITS.**

**Why nonprofits, not government?**
- **Government is the target:** These movements seek to change government policy or society
- **Independence:** Nonprofits can criticize government without being shut down
- **Innovation:** New ideas often emerge outside established institutions
- **Mobilization:** Nonprofits can organize and advocate
- **Flexibility:** Can respond quickly to opportunities and challenges

**Government tends to be:**
- Reactive, not proactive
- Constrained by politics and bureaucracy
- Slow to change
- Representative of existing power structures

**Nonprofits are:**
- Innovative and experimental
- Independent from political constraints
- Able to represent marginalized voices
- Flexible and responsive

### D. The Double Utility of Giving

**i. Does the gift make Peter happier? YES** - he gets a nice present

**ii. Does the gift make Rachel happier? YES** - giving feels good

**iii. What is "the double utility of giving"?**

**Double utility of giving** means that giving creates happiness for BOTH:
1. The **giver** (Rachel feels good from being generous)
2. The **receiver** (Peter enjoys the gift)

**Total happiness increase = Rachel's happiness + Peter's happiness**

**This is why we give gifts:**
- The transaction creates MORE total happiness than if Rachel kept the money
- Both parties benefit
- Gift-giving can be socially efficient despite not being "rational" in narrow economic terms

**iv. Does Rachel experience double utility when paying taxes? GENERALLY NO.**

**Why not?**
- Taxes are compulsory, not voluntary
- Rachel doesn't feel the warm glow of voluntarily helping
- She may resent having to pay
- She doesn't know exactly where her money goes
- She can't direct her money to specific people/causes she cares about

**Some people DO feel good about paying taxes:**
- Civic pride
- Belief in public goods
- But generally less warm glow than charitable giving

**v. What about donating to a soup kitchen? YES - double utility applies.**

**Why?**
- Donation is voluntary (Rachel chooses to give)
- Rachel feels good about helping (warm glow)
- She knows her money is going to a cause she believes in
- The soup kitchen beneficiaries receive help
- **Total happiness = Rachel's warm glow + hungry people fed**

**This is a key insight for understanding charitable giving:**
- It's not just about helping others
- The giver also benefits
- This explains why people give even without direct benefit to themselves
- The nonprofit form enables this voluntary, mission-driven giving

## Key Takeaways

### Nonprofits Exist Because of Market Failures

1. **Asymmetric Information**
   - When consumers can't evaluate quality (medicine, education, charity)
   - Nonprofit form signals commitment to mission over profit
   - Nondistribution constraint removes profit incentive to cut quality

2. **Positive Externalities**
   - When activities benefit others beyond the direct participants
   - Markets underproduce these activities
   - Nonprofits + government subsidies encourage production

3. **Public Goods**
   - When goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous
   - Markets fail to provide them (free rider problem)
   - Nonprofits + government step in

### The Nonprofit Form as Commitment Device

**The nondistribution constraint is the key:**
- Commits organization to mission
- Signals trustworthiness to donors/beneficiaries
- Removes profit incentive to exploit information asymmetry
- Enables mission-driven motivation (double utility of giving)

### Nonprofits vs. Government

**Nonprofits' advantages:**
- Innovation and experimentation
- Independence and flexibility
- Closer to communities
- Mission-driven (can attract passionate workers)
- Enable voluntary giving (with double utility)

**Government's advantages:**
- Scale and efficiency for large programs
- Mandatory participation (solves free rider)
- Stability and resources
- Ability to run deficits
- Legitimacy and accountability (sometimes)

### Tax Policy

**Tax exemption + deduction = massive subsidy:**
- Nonprofits don't pay tax on surplus
- Donors can deduct contributions
- Government effectively pays for part of charitable activity
- Encourages private provision of public goods
