**Topic:** Management Processes as Solutions to Information + Incentive Problems  
**Date:** 2026-04-01

## Key Concepts Overview

This class is about **process design** inside nonprofits: how good management can mitigate the nonprofit sector’s core weakness (hard‑to‑measure performance).

Two goals nonprofits must pursue:
1. **Figure out what to do** (strategy/analysis).
2. **Get people on board** (buy‑in/coordination).

A good **planning process** can do both:
- produce information (surface options, costs, constraints, and expected outcomes);
- build buy‑in (people support what they help create).

The recurring tools:
- decision criteria (“three questions”) to allocate resources;
- anti‑silo mechanisms (peer review/cross‑team work);
- measurement vocabulary (output vs outcome; impact multipliers);
- mission discipline (comparative advantage; avoiding mission creep).

## Question 1: Review — What two goals must nonprofits pursue?

1. **Analysis:** choose the right initiatives (data, alternatives, prioritization).
2. **Advocacy/buy‑in:** align staff/board/donors to execute.

---

## Question 2: Planning

### A. What is a planning process? Does it help either goal? Both?

**Planning process:** a structured, recurring process for setting priorities, allocating resources, and coordinating execution.

It helps **both**:
- improves strategy by forcing disciplined comparisons;
- improves buy‑in by involving stakeholders in decisions.

### B. Why did JDC need a new planning process? First step? Who was involved?

JDC needed a more analytical process to overcome **inertia** and to allocate scarce resources for maximum social return.

**First step:** one‑on‑one conversations with senior leadership to surface how they made decisions and to build ownership of a shared framework.

**Who was involved and why:** senior executives (and leadership stakeholders) because buy‑in at the top is necessary for the framework to be used when the CEO is not in the room.

## Question 3: Community Center (CC) — Reallocating Subsidy from School to Cultural Department

### A. Can Adele just decide on her own? (Incentives + information)

**NO.**
- **Information:** department heads, fundraisers, donors, and board members have relevant information about effects on programs, donor behavior, and institutional strategy.
- **Incentives:** stakeholders will resist or sabotage decisions that hurt them; the CEO needs a process that channels incentives toward the organization’s overall mission.

### B. Is this appropriate for the annual planning process?

**YES.** It’s a classic planning question: resource allocation across programs and mission priorities.

### C. Carlo (fundraising) warns donors/board came through the school — what concern? How can planning help?

Carlo is flagging **political economy risk**:
- donor backlash;
- board resistance;
- fundraising decline;
- reputational harm.

Planning helps by structuring conversations, surfacing risks early, and building a coalition (including donors/board) for the final decision.

### D. Who should Adele start with? Separate meetings vs one big meeting?

Start with key leaders most directly impacted and those with critical information (school head, CCD head, fundraising head), then expand to donors/board once a credible plan and rationale exists.

Separate meetings can:
- reduce direct conflict and positional bargaining;
- allow tailored information gathering;
- build sequential buy‑in.

A single big meeting can surface division but is often inefficient if the goal is coalition‑building.

### E–F. True/False planning outcomes

- **TRUE:** planning helps allocate resources where needed.
- **TRUE:** planning helps build support among professionals, board, donors.

## Question 4: Saylor Twift Concert — Silos and Information Sharing

### A. Two reasons Pam didn’t mention the connection (one innocent; one less so). Which reason will she give?

**Innocent (information):** it didn’t occur to her that the connection mattered to other departments / it happened quickly.

**Less innocent (incentives):** she wanted the benefit (prestige/donor goodwill) to stay within the school.

Pam will give the innocent explanation because it’s more defensible.

### B. What is a “silo,” and why is it a problem?

**Silo:** departments operate as isolated units with weak information sharing and coordination.

It creates:
- **information problems** (people don’t learn what other teams know);
- **incentive problems** (helping other departments doesn’t pay).

### C. Random cross‑department conversations every two weeks: rationale and limits

**Rationale:** create low‑cost cross‑pollination, build relationships, and increase informal information flow.

**Limits:** if incentives remain misaligned, people can treat it as a box‑check and avoid meaningful cooperation.

### D. What is “peer review,” and why use it in planning?

**Peer review:** a proposal from one department is reviewed by a counterpart leader in another department.

Benefits:
- improves proposal quality (fresh perspective);
- forces cross‑department information sharing;
- increases investment and buy‑in by involving others in shaping the plan;
- can seed cross‑department task forces.

## Question 5: Fundraising Needs Current Information

### A. Why does Bart’s team need details about new initiatives (goals/strategy/why)?

Two reasons:
- fundraisers raise more money when they can explain **what the nonprofit is doing and why**;
- fundraising should match the organization’s actual priorities (avoid raising for outdated initiatives).

### B. Why might fundraisers not have this information?

**Silos** and misaligned incentives: program teams may not prioritize timely sharing with fundraising.

### C. Can planning help?

**YES.** A good planning process forces program teams to articulate goals and strategies in a way fundraisers can use.

---

## Question 6: Budget Scenarios (1% / +10% / −5%)

### A. What information problem does this address?

**Asymmetric information:** department heads know better than the CEO what cuts/expansions actually do.

Multiple scenarios force departments to reveal priorities and tradeoffs.

### B. What incentive problem can undercut it? What can Adele do?

Incentive to **game**:
- exaggerate harms in the cut scenario;
- propose cutting items the CEO values most to deter cuts.

Mitigations:
- hold department heads accountable to their proposed cuts if that scenario is chosen;
- call out strategic exaggeration directly and require alternative plans;
- require explanation memos with specific, falsifiable assumptions.

### C. Board chair reports grumbling: how should Adele answer?

Explain directly that the exercise is a disciplined way to:
- gather real operational information;
- make tradeoffs explicit;
- build buy‑in for inevitable resource allocation decisions.

## Question 7: The “Three Questions” — What are they measuring?

They measure:
1. **Importance of the problem** the nonprofit is trying to solve.
2. **Effectiveness of the response** (social return).
3. **Whether the nonprofit is the right organization** (comparative advantage).

---

## Question 8: The First Question (Importance)

### A. What is it?

**How important is the problem we are trying to solve?**

### B. Lee Goldman and pandemics (2005 vs 2020): lesson?

The importance of problems changes. A planning process should force periodic reassessment rather than autopilot.

### C. Homeless shelter vs cleaning a polluted river: why hard; what to do instead?

The comparison is hard because it requires value judgments across incommensurable goods.

The discipline is to show **what is important**, and to make **more focused comparisons** when possible (closer substitutes are easier to evaluate).

### D. Appalachia vs Westchester child care/medical care: what information do you need?

- number of children and severity of need;
- poverty rates and baseline services;
- what other organizations/government programs already provide;
- where Help! has the ability to make the biggest difference.

---

## Question 9: The Second Question (Effectiveness)

### A. What is it?

**How effective is our response?**

### B. Output vs outcome

- **Output:** what you did (e.g., vaccinations delivered).
- **Outcome:** the effect on welfare (e.g., health improvements).

### C. Vaccinations counted: output or outcome? How reliable?

**Output.** If the intervention is known to work, outputs can be a strong proxy for outcomes, but the ideal measure is still outcomes/social return.

### D. What is an “impact multiplier”?

An action with second‑order effects that magnify impact (one input generates many downstream benefits).

### E. Vaccinating pediatricians: what impact multiplier?

Protecting doctors preserves their capacity to treat/vaccinate many others (one vaccine yields broader benefits).

---

## Question 10: The Third Question (Comparative Advantage; Mission Creep)

### A. What is it?

**Are we the right organization to do this?** Do we have a comparative advantage relative to other organizations?

### B. HerJustice does child support but not housing court: why? Is eviction less serious?

It’s about comparative advantage and avoiding mission creep:
- housing court may already have other providers, so HerJustice’s incremental value is smaller;
- focusing on under‑served areas (like child support) can yield higher marginal impact.

### C. Legal Momentum: impact litigation + helpline — why those two?

- Helpline provides broad access for people who need direction.
- Impact litigation changes rules for many people through precedent.
- Synergy: the helpline can surface the right cases for impact litigation.

### D. CEO urged to condemn mayor: why hesitate; relevance to third question?

Hesitation reasons:
- advocacy may not be the organization’s comparative advantage;
- political statements can jeopardize cooperation with government partners needed to deliver services.

The third question pushes mission discipline: some organizations should do advocacy; others should deliver services.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Good nonprofit management is **process design**: planning, measurement, and buy‑in.
- Use “three questions” to discipline resource allocation: **importance, effectiveness, comparative advantage**.
- Fix silos with structures (peer review, cross‑department work) that address both information and incentives.
- Outputs are easier than outcomes; outcomes are better. Use outputs as proxies only when justified.

---

## Notes for Class Discussion

- When asked “should we do X,” answer in the three‑question structure.
- When asked “why didn’t people share info,” answer in silo terms: specialization → information gaps; incentives → no reward for sharing.
- For any metric, ask: “Is this an output or an outcome?” and “Can it be gamed?”
