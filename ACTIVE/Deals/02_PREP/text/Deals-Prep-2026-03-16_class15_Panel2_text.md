# Class 15 Prep Sheet: Negotiation (Panel 2 — my panel)

**Course:** Deals  
**Topic:** BATNA / reservation price / ZOPA; strategic bargaining failures; bargaining power; FOTE vs Poker School; multi-issue negotiation + precedent constraints  
**Date:** 2026-04-29

## Key Concepts Overview (fast definitions)

- **BATNA** (“Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement”): what you will do if there is no deal; it sets your **walk-away point**.
- **Reservation price**: the worst deal you will accept (minimum for a seller; maximum for a buyer/employer).
- **ZOPA** (“Zone Of Possible Agreement”): overlap between the parties’ reservation prices.
- **Distribution vs creation**:
  - **Distributive**: split a fixed surplus (who gets the $100 of “extra value”).
  - **Integrative**: trade across issues to create value (logrolling; packages).

## 1. Alice Advocate ↔ Betty Banker (hiring negotiation)

### 1A. What does BATNA stand for? What are the BATNAs here?

**BATNA** = **Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement**.

- **Betty’s BATNA:** hire **Chris** (or keep the role unfilled temporarily / run a search) instead of Alice.
- **Alice’s BATNA:** stay at **Big Law** at **100X** with the non-money benefits she prefers (craft of lawyering, more transactions, collegiality).

### 1B. What does “reservation price” mean? What is Alice’s reservation price?

**Reservation price** = the **minimum** Alice would accept to switch (her walk-away threshold).

- **Alice’s reservation price:** **140X** (she will not switch for less).

### 1C. What does the term “ZOPA” mean?

**ZOPA** = the set of numbers that both sides would accept (overlap between:
- Betty’s max willingness to pay, and
- Alice’s minimum willingness to accept).

### 1D. Betty will pay up to 160X. Is there a ZOPA?

**YES.** If Alice won’t take less than **140X** and Betty will pay up to **160X**, the ZOPA is:
- **140X to 160X**.

### 1E. If there is a ZOPA, is agreement guaranteed?

**NO.** A ZOPA means a deal is *possible*, not inevitable. No-deal can happen if:
- **strategic bargaining** creates impasse (bad anchors, ego/face, misread toughness);
- parties can’t credibly communicate reservation values (each suspects bluffing);
- non-price terms (role, title, culture, autonomy) change perceived value and make “140X” a moving target in practice;
- timing/relationship friction ends talks (someone walks to avoid a hard conversation).

## 2. Strategic bargaining and why it can backfire (K&S theme)

### 2A. How is Betty hoping Alice will respond? How does Betty see this evolving?

Betty is trying to:
- **anchor low** at **120X**, framed as “not about money,”
- expect Alice to **counter high**, then
- make slow “concessions” so Alice feels she “won,”
- settle somewhere inside the ZOPA while keeping price closer to Betty’s preferred number.

### 2B. Alice is tough for clients but not for herself. How can this backfire?

Betty’s plan backfires if Alice treats **120X** as a real signal of value and avoids conflict:
- Alice may **not counter** (or counters timidly), then later regrets it and exits.
- Alice may **accept too quickly**, feel exploited, and become a retention/commitment risk.
- Alice may interpret the “not about money” pitch as manipulation and disengage.

### 2C. Alice cares about non-money terms and ends the conversation early. How can this backfire?

Betty’s “slow concession” strategy depends on a live bargaining process. It fails if:
- Alice **doesn’t prioritize the money fight** and instead evaluates the whole move (culture, autonomy, work style).
- Alice postpones, then **anchors on staying** (status quo bias) and the deal dies.
- The initial low number creates a negative vibe, and Alice never re-engages.

### 2D. Alice demands 200X to “play tough.” How can her plan backfire?

Alice risks:
- **credibility loss** (“this person is not serious”).
- **insult/face threat** (especially if 200X exceeds what Betty earned), triggering a walk-away.
- pushing Betty toward her BATNA (Chris) because negotiation costs rise.
- anchoring the negotiation around “unreasonable demands,” making later “reasonable” counters less persuasive.

### 2E. Even with a ZOPA, strategic bargaining can produce no deal. What does K&S mean?

K&S’s point: **bargaining tactics can destroy the deal space**.
- Parties don’t know each other’s true reservation prices and **miscalculate**.
- Extreme anchors and “toughness” create **mistrust** and **retaliation** (each side hardens).
- Concessions can be misread as weakness or bad faith; deadlines and emotion create **breakdown**.

### 2F. What should Betty offer after 120X? Does she need to offer 140X? What if she offers 125X?

Given the facts, Alice’s reservation price is **140X**. If nothing else changes, Betty needs an **all-in package worth at least 140X**.

What Betty should offer depends on what she wants to signal:
- If she wants to keep the process moving without ending it, a credible next move is **135X + structure to reach 140X** (e.g., guaranteed bonus / deferred comp / signing bonus) while emphasizing non-money improvements she can actually deliver.
- If Betty offers **125X** with no other value, **no deal** under the stated reservation price.

### 2G. What counter-offer should Alice make? How much should she come down from 200X?

Alice should trade off **credibility vs anchoring value**:
- She should come down enough to look serious, but not so much that the 200X anchor evaporates.
- A plausible counter is a **package**: e.g., **155–160X** (or **150X base + guaranteed bonus**) plus specific non-money asks (team autonomy, staffing control, title clarity, exit options).
- Competing considerations:
  - Keep the number inside/near the ZOPA so Betty doesn’t default to Chris.
  - Avoid conceding so fast that Betty learns “start low, you’ll fold.”
  - Preserve relationship; this is a repeated-game professional setting.

## 3. Bidder ↔ Target (transaction negotiation)

### 3A. What is the ZOPA?

- Target will sell as low as **$900X**.
- Bidder will pay up to **$1000X**.
- **ZOPA:** **$900X to $1000X** (surplus = **$100X**).

### 3B. How is the $100X divided? What role does bargaining power play (K&S)?

Price inside the ZOPA is set by bargaining power and process:
- Who can credibly walk (stronger BATNA) captures more surplus.
- Who has better information about the other side’s limits captures more surplus.
- Time pressure, deal alternatives, internal constraints, and credibility all move the split.

### 3C. “Improve your BATNA” — how could each side do this?

- **Bidder:** cultivate alternative targets; delay; build organically; partner/joint venture; keep capital flexible.
- **Target:** create alternative bidders (auction); improve standalone plan; restructure/recap; find strategic partners.

### 3D. “Tie your hands” — example for Bidder?

Bidder can credibly commit to a ceiling or process constraint:
- board-authorized maximum bid (“we literally cannot go above $X”),
- public guidance / financing cap,
- deadline or “one-shot” final offer.

### 3E. How could Target tie its hands?

Target can:
- run a formal auction with a timeline and bidding rules,
- adopt internal governance constraints (need board vote; committee approval),
- credibly signal fiduciary constraints and process discipline (“we will not take an early lowball without market check”).

### 3F. “Learn about the other side’s BATNA” — how could each side do this?

- **Bidder learns Target’s BATNA:** diligence on Target’s standalone prospects, other suitors, internal pressures, financing needs, shareholder base, banker signaling.
- **Target learns Bidder’s BATNA:** is Bidder under pressure to deploy cash; synergies unique to Bidder; competing targets; CEO incentives; financing availability.

### 3G. Sellers trigger an auction. Which strategy is this?

Primarily **improve your BATNA** (create alternatives and increase the cost to the buyer of walking away).

### 3H. Shareholder approval to sell a public company. Which strategy is this?

**Tie your hands.** Management can claim a credible constraint: “we can’t guarantee closing below a number shareholders will approve,” and a vote adds process friction that can strengthen bargaining posture.

### 3I. How would they negotiate using “FOTE”?

Under **Full Open and Truthful Exchange**:
- Parties disclose real priorities and constraints.
- They aim for a fair split (often closer to midpoint) and trade terms openly.
- The main goal is closing efficiently with minimal waste from bluffing.

### 3J. How would they negotiate with the “Poker School” approach?

Under **Poker School**:
- Start with extreme positions; conceal true limits.
- Use bluffs, selective disclosure, and staged concessions.
- Treat information as a weapon; focus on capturing surplus.

### 3K. Target uses FOTE; Bidder uses Poker School. What happens?

Bidder exploits Target’s openness:
- Bidder learns Target’s real floor and drives price toward **$900X**.
- Target’s “truthfulness” becomes a one-sided concession in a strategic environment.

### 3L. Same as 3K, but Target catches Bidder exaggerating. What happens?

Trust collapses and Target recalibrates:
- Target shifts to Poker School, demands verification, or walks to auction.
- Bidder pays a credibility penalty (more costly concessions to reestablish trust).

## 4. Dean Dana ↔ Professor Paul (multi-issue negotiation + precedent)

### 4A. One issue at a time vs hear views on all issues first — which is better?

Dana’s approach (hear views on all issues first) is better for **multi-issue bargaining**:
- It identifies tradeoffs (logrolling): one side cares more about office, another about salary, etc.
- It avoids getting stuck early on a single distributive fight.

Paul’s one-by-one approach can be worse because it sacrifices package-deal gains and locks in positions before seeing the full space.

### 4B(i). If only Dana/Paul preferences matter, what does the deal look like?

Given the facts:
- Dana values: **courses Paul teaches** + can offer **corner office**.
- Paul values: **salary**, dislikes admin work, doesn’t need secretarial help, and has his preferred non-salary terms already.

Deal design:
- **High salary** for Paul.
- **Corner office** (low cost to Dana; high value to Paul if he cares at all).
- **No admin responsibilities**.
- **Minimal/standard secretarial support** (since Paul doesn’t care).
- **Course assignment** matched to Dana’s needs.
- **Named professorship** promised later only if credible (or substituted with immediate salary/other perks if not).

### 4B(ii). Precedent problem: other faculty demand the same. How does this complicate things?

Dana now has an internal political constraint:
- Visible concessions raise future costs (copycat demands).
- She may prefer **non-observable** or **one-time** benefits over permanent, visible salary increases.
- She may need to justify terms as “market” or “exceptional circumstances.”

### 4B(iii). Easier or harder if other faculty can observe some but not all of what Paul received?

Usually **easier** if some terms can be kept opaque:
- Dana can shift value into less observable benefits (office, course load tweaks, discretionary research support) to reduce precedent risk.

### 4B(iv). Can Dana turn the precedent problem into a bargaining advantage?

Yes. Dana can use it as a credible constraint (**tie hands**):
- “I can’t move salary beyond X without triggering internal blowback,”
then compensate through other dimensions that don’t set the same precedent (role design, office, timing commitments, discretionary support).

### 4B(v). Paul has the non-salary terms he wants at his current employer. How can he use this as an advantage?

That is Paul’s BATNA strength:
- He can credibly say, “I’m already fine on non-salary; to move, salary must justify it.”
- He can demand a salary premium because Dana is asking him to give up a known-good package.

### 4B(vi). If Paul tells Dana this, why might she not find it persuasive? Does she need to say so?

Poker School problem: Dana can’t verify Paul’s claims about his current package, and he has incentives to exaggerate.

It is socially costly to call it out directly (“I think you’re bluffing”), so Dana may:
- respond indirectly (market data; internal constraints; “that’s not our understanding”),
- insist on objective benchmarks,
- treat the claim as non-credible unless backed by specifics.

## Notes for Class Discussion

- When asked “what number should they offer,” answer with **reservation prices + credibility constraints**, not vibes.
- Always separate: **(1) is there a ZOPA?** from **(2) who captures surplus and why?**
- Use the three bargaining power levers as a checklist: **improve BATNA / tie hands / learn BATNA**.
