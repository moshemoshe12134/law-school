## Key Concepts Overview (the Deals lens)

This class is (mostly) about **how bargaining power shows up as deal terms**, and why “profit participation” is a minefield:

- **Bargaining power → rights, not salary:** when talent has leverage, they can trade cash comp for *control rights* (sequel rights, merchandising, approvals).
- **Hold-up + measurement problems:** when one party controls the books (and definitions), “profit” can be engineered away.
- **Net vs gross participation:** “net” is cheap for the studio to give (because it’s easy to define away); “gross” is expensive but credible.
- **Tax gross-ups:** if a payment triggers tax, “making someone whole” can require paying more than the tax amount.

## Question 1: George Lucas and Bargaining Power

### 1A. Initially, Lucas had a contract to make two movies. What were they? How much was he going to get paid for the second movie?

The assigned Lucas reading focuses on the *Star Wars* negotiation and doesn’t clearly answer the “two movies” detail. What it does give:

- Lucas earned **$150,000** for directing *American Graffiti*.
- After *American Graffiti*, he was “entitled to” **$500,000** for directing *Star Wars*, but he chose not to take it.

Working assumption for class discussion (flag as uncertain): the “two movies” are likely *THX 1138* and *American Graffiti*, and the “second movie” pay is the **$150,000** figure.

### 1B. What happened to give him more bargaining power?

*American Graffiti* was a big success, making Lucas a “hot commodity.” That success gave him:
- better outside options (other studios / projects),
- credibility (he can deliver a profitable film),
- leverage to ask for nonstandard terms.

### 1C. What did his agent suggest as a way to use this bargaining power? What did he do instead?

- Agent’s suggestion: take a **much higher directing fee** (salary bump).
- Lucas instead: kept salary at **$150,000** and asked for (i) **merchandising rights** and (ii) **sequel rights**.

### 1D. Why was the studio willing to accept his suggestion?

Fox didn’t value those rights much at the time:
- merchandising wasn’t seen as a meaningful revenue stream, and Fox had been burned before;
- sequels were not priced as valuable if the first movie was expected to flop;
- the studio likely preferred limiting fixed cost (salary) and was happy to “give away” low-salience rights.

### 1E. How did Lucas’s deal compare with other successful writers/directors? Was his main motivation money or something else?

Compared to peers, Lucas’s move was unusually **ownership/control heavy** rather than **cash heavy**.

Motivation (based on the reading + common-sense fit with the terms):
- **Money**: the upside was enormous (sequels + merch).
- **Control**: ownership of sequels/merch also supports creative direction and brand stewardship.

### 1F. Was Lucas able to negotiate a similar deal for Raiders? Why or why not?

Likely **not to the same extent**:
- after *Star Wars*, studios understand the value of merchandising + sequel rights and are less willing to give them away;
- bargaining power can be person-specific and project-specific; outside options and the counterparty’s alternatives change.

### 1G. Years later, Lucas sold his rights to Disney. How much did he get?

The assigned Lucas reading reports **$4.05 billion**.

### 1H. General lesson about bargaining power from Lucas’s negotiation

When you have leverage, you can often do better by negotiating for:
- **upside and control rights** (ownership of valuable revenue streams),
- not just **higher fixed pay**.

### 1I. Coda: what disillusioned Lucas (not money)?

Public reports (not in the assigned reading) suggest Lucas was unhappy about **loss of creative control** / how Disney handled the story direction and his ideas for future films.

## Question 2: Batfilm Prods. v. Warner Brothers

### 2A. What role did plaintiffs play?

They acquired and developed the underlying Batman film rights and were entitled to compensation if a Batman motion picture was produced.

### 2B. What fixed compensation did they get?

From the excerpt:
- **$300,000** fixed compensation for *Batman*,
- plus a **$100,000 deferment** once the film generated a specified level of receipts.

### 2C. What contingent compensation was offered? What was the dispute?

- Contingent compensation: **13% of “Net Profits”** (as defined in the contract attachment).
- Dispute: *Batman* generated enormous revenue, but **no “Net Profits”** under the contractual definition, so plaintiffs got no profit participation.

### 2D. Is the court willing to consider fairness? Is that approach well suited to plaintiffs?

**No.** The court explicitly refuses to remake deals because they feel “unfair.”

And the court thinks this “hands off” approach is especially apt here because:
- one plaintiff was a sophisticated former studio general counsel/executive, and
- they did not show coercion or conscience-shocking terms.

### 2E. What doctrine is the court applying? What’s the defense? What’s at stake?

- Doctrine: **unconscionability** (including partial unconscionability under Civil Code § 1670.5).
- Defense: contract enforcement and predictability; courts don’t rewrite bargains just because outcomes look lopsided ex post.
- Claimed “what’s at stake”: industry predictability/financing—if courts routinely second-guess participation definitions, studios can’t price risk and structure financing.

### 2F. What is “overhead”? What was the complaint? What did the court conclude?

**Overhead** = allocated indirect costs (general/admin) charged to a production using a formula (here, percentage add-ons).

Plaintiffs complained overhead charges (e.g., **15% production overhead**, **10% advertising overhead**) were excessive and applied too broadly.

Court conclusion: plaintiffs failed to prove the overhead percentages were unconscionably higher than actual overhead (and overhead can’t be measured item-by-item with precision).

### 2G. If the parties knew 15% overstates “true” overhead, does it matter?

Core idea: if both sides understand the term, **it can still be the deal**—courts generally won’t rescue a party from a bad bargain.

But it *could* matter if:
- the term was concealed or misrepresented, or
- the overall process/substance “shocks the conscience” (unconscionability).

### 2H. Videocassette royalties complaint and holding

Plaintiffs complained that only **20% of video revenue** was credited (and still subject to a distribution fee), making it hard to reach net profits.

Court: rejected; treated as **industry standard** and known/unchallenged by the sophisticated negotiator.

### 2I. Is “net profit” an accurate measure of movie profitability for shareholders?

Usually **no**. “Net profits” in Hollywood contracts are a **contractual construct** with special deductions (overhead, distribution fees, discounted home video royalties, etc.).

Shareholder accounting uses different conventions and will generally show profitability even when “net profits” participation shows zero.

### 2J. Can a movie be very profitable yet pay nothing under a net profits clause?

**YES.** That’s the whole “Hollywood accounting” point: the definition/waterfall can make “net profits” disappear even when the studio is making real money.

## Question 3: Terminator 3 — Gross-Ups and Stronger Participations

### 3A. Minimum compensation?

From the Slate background: **$29.25 million** pay-or-play, plus potential overage and perks.

### 3B. Key difference from Batfilm’s participation?

Schwarzenegger’s participation is tied to a more credible base:
- he gets a percentage of **gross receipts** after hitting a negotiated **cash breakeven** point,
- and the “breakeven” definition is harder to game (notably, more realistic treatment of home video receipts for breakeven calculations).

### 3C. Why did he have so much bargaining power?

He was essential to get the movie financed (“No Schwarzenegger, no money”), because distributors/financiers conditioned their commitments on him starring.

### 3D. Nonfinancial benefits? Creative control?

Nonfinancial benefits include:
- major perks/expense packages, and
- broad **approval rights** (director, principal cast, and even certain staff).

That’s not total “final cut” creative control, but it’s meaningful contractual influence.

### 3E. What percentage of receipts after breakeven?

From the background: **20%**.

### 3F(i). What expenses are subtracted from adjusted gross receipts to calculate cash breakeven?

From the contract excerpt in the discussion questions, the breakeven calculation recoups categories like:
- actual distribution expenses attributable to the picture,
- production costs (including certain participations/deferments and the completion bond fee),
- actual interest and financing costs,
- residuals (with an anti-double-deduction principle).

### 3F(ii). Home video: what % is included in adjusted gross receipts for breakeven? Compare to Batfilm.

- For cash breakeven, the contract uses a much more realistic approach (described as **100% home video royalty** = home video revenues less costs).
- Batfilm’s net profits structure credits only a **small “royalty” slice** of home video (e.g., 20%), making breakeven/net profit far harder to reach.

### 3G. Purpose of the “loanout” provision?

Tax and payment structuring:
- pay a corporation that “loans” the actor’s services,
- manage withholding/foreign tax exposure,
- preserve flexibility in how income is recognized and taxed.

### 3H–J. Why gross up? Example with 50% tax rate

If a foreign tax is $100,000, paying $100,000 is not enough because the reimbursement itself can trigger tax.

If combined marginal tax is 50% and the foreign tax isn’t deductible:
- required payment = **$100,000 / (1 − 0.50) = $200,000**.

So the statement “X/(1−T)” is **TRUE**.

### 3K. Why cover professional tax advice fees?

To truly put the actor in the “same after-tax position,” you have to cover the **transaction costs** of complying with the tax complexity the deal creates—otherwise the actor is still worse off.

### 3L. Why net out credits/deductions? Who requested it?

Purpose:
- prevent “double recovery” (getting reimbursed for taxes that are offset by credits/deductions),
- limit reimbursement to actual incremental economic harm,
- deter behavior by the artist that increases taxes outside the deal’s intended structure.

Likely requested by the **studio** (it’s a liability-limiting term).

## Question 4: Two Types of Participations — Net and Gross

### 4A(i). “Adjusted gross receipts”: whose receipts? Is it $100M or something else?

Not the theater’s box office gross. “Adjusted gross receipts” generally means **the studio/distributor’s receipts after upstream splits/fees**.

So if theaters sell $100M in tickets, the studio’s relevant receipts are typically **less** (e.g., after the exhibitor’s share and any contractual “distribution fee” definition).

### 4A(ii). Home video revenue: is $50M included in adjusted gross receipts in a standard contract?

**Yes, but discounted.** Standard participation accounting often credits only a **royalty percentage** of home video receipts (classic example: ~20%), not the full amount.

### 4B(i). Why does Scarlett care about theatrical-only release vs day-and-date streaming?

Because her compensation/bonuses (and future bargaining power) are often tied to **theatrical box office metrics**:
- day-and-date streaming can cannibalize box office and reduce reported “gross” numbers used for bonuses/participations;
- streaming revenue is harder to measure, easier to allocate internally, and may be excluded from “gross” definitions.

### 4B(ii). Which party likely got the favorable settlement?

The star (Scarlett) likely did, because the studio faced meaningful litigation + reputational risk and had incentives to resolve it.

### 4C(i). How is “gross participation” different from “net participation”?

- **Gross participation:** paid from a defined “gross/adjusted gross” revenue base earlier in the waterfall; fewer deductions; harder to game.
- **Net participation:** paid only after many deductions; cheap to promise; easy to make zero.

### 4C(ii). What costs are subtracted for Barbara’s gross? For Art’s net?

Typical pattern to have ready (exact definitions vary by contract):
- **Director fixed fee:** usually not subtracted before “gross” participation; **is** part of costs before “net.”
- **Distribution fee:** often subtracted (or embedded) before “adjusted gross”; also affects “net.”
- **Advertising/P&A:** often not subtracted before “gross” participation; **is** charged before “net.”

### 4C(iii). First-dollar gross: 10% with $5M advance — how much adjusted gross to exceed the advance?

She earns 10% of adjusted gross. To earn more than a $5M advance:

- break-even adjusted gross for the advance = **$5M / 0.10 = $50M**.

So she gets additional payments only after adjusted gross exceeds **$50M**.

### 4D(i). Can Big Hit be very profitable to shareholders but generate no gross participation for Barbara?

If it’s truly a **first-dollar gross**, generally **NO**—any adjusted gross generates participation (though advances can delay additional checks).

But “profitability” can still diverge from the participation base if:
- “adjusted gross” is defined narrowly, and
- profits come from revenue streams excluded from that definition.

### 4D(ii). True/false: Big Hit can be very profitable to shareholders but generate no net participation for Art.

**TRUE.**

## Notes for Class Discussion

- The practical meta-point: “profit participation” is not about fairness; it’s about **definitions + leverage**.
- Be ready to translate each term into the course triad:
  - **information/measurement** (who controls accounting? what’s observable?),
  - **incentives** (what behavior does each definition encourage?),
  - **uncertainty** (what revenue streams are hard to forecast; how do parties hedge?).
