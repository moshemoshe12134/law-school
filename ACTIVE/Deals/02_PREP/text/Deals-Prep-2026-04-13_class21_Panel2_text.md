# Class 21 Prep Sheet: Earnouts as Both a Solution and a Source of Information and Incentive Problems

**Course:** Deals
**Topic:** Earnouts as Both a Solution and a Source of Information and Incentive Problems (Panel 2)
**Date:** Spring 2026

---

## Key Concepts Overview

This class explores **earnouts**—a contractual mechanism where part of the purchase price is contingent on future performance. Earnouts sit at the heart of what Deals is about:

**The core problem:** When buyers and sellers disagree about the value of an asset (usually because of uncertainty about future performance), they may not have a Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA). The deal dies.

**The earnout solution:** By making part of the price contingent on actual future outcomes, you can bridge valuation gaps and save deals that would otherwise fail.

**The catch (this class's central insight):** Earnouts solve information and incentive problems, but they **create new information and incentive problems**. This is why they're used less often than you might expect.

### Key Framework: The Earnout Paradox

```
Information/Incentive Problem → Earnout Solution → NEW Information/Incentive Problems
```

### Three Core Problems Connection

- **Information Asymmetry:** Seller knows more about the asset's potential than buyer (and has incentive to overstate it)
- **Uncertainty:** Neither party knows how the asset will perform in the future
- **Agency Costs:** Buyer controls the asset post-closing and can manipulate earnout metrics

## Question 1: Software Company Acquisition (ZOPA and Earnout Basics)

### The Scenario

**Seller** has an established software business with robust existing revenue.
- Seller values the existing business at $200M-$250M

**Buyer** is considering making a bid.
- Buyer values the existing business at $175M-$225M

**The complication:** A new software version launches in six months.
- Skeptics (including Buyer management): 20% chance it sells 300 million copies, adding $100M
- Loyalists (including Seller management): 80% chance it sells 300 million copies, adding $100M

---

### A. Without the new software, is there a ZOPA in this transaction?

**YES.**

The Zone of Possible Agreement exists because:
- Seller's reservation price: $200M (lowest seller would accept)
- Buyer's reservation price: $225M (most buyer would pay)
- **ZOPA = $25M overlap** from $200M to $225M

The deal could happen at any price in this range.

---

### B. With the new software, does it seem (at least at first glance) that there is a ZOPA for this transaction?

**NO.**

The contingency kills the deal. Let's calculate the new reservation prices:

**Seller's expected value with new software:**
- Existing business: $200M
- Expected value of new software: 80% × $100M = $80M
- **Seller's reservation price: $200M + $80M = $280M**

**Buyer's expected value with new software:**
- Existing business: $225M
- Expected value of new software: 20% × $100M = $20M
- **Buyer's reservation price: $225M + $20M = $245M**

**The problem:** Seller won't accept less than $280M; Buyer won't pay more than $245M. **No ZOPA exists.**

This is the classic problem: divergent expectations about a contingent future event can destroy deals that would otherwise make sense.

---

### C. Do you think predictions about the success of the new software pose issues of asymmetric information? Or uncertainty? Or both?

**BOTH.**

**Uncertainty component:**
- Neither party knows for sure how the market will receive the new software
- Competitor's product quality is unknown
- Consumer preferences are uncertain
- This is genuine uncertainty—no one has the information

**Asymmetric information component:**
- Seller knows more about the software development process
- Seller knows more about technical quality and potential bugs
- Seller has more insight into customer feedback and beta testing
- **Critical point:** Seller has incentive to misrepresent this information to drive up the price

**Why this matters:**
- Pure uncertainty (both equally ignorant) is easier to solve with risk allocation
- Asymmetric information (one knows more) creates the classic "lemons" problem
- The combination makes valuation extremely difficult

---

### D. What contractual mechanism can potentially help to enable Buyer and Seller to find a mutually agreeable price?

**AN EARNOUT (or Contingent Value Right if public company).**

**How it works:**
- Pay a fixed portion upfront based on the value of the existing business (the $200M-$225M range)
- Make the additional payment for the new software contingent on actual performance
- "Let things play out and see whose prediction was right"

**Why this restores the ZOPA:**
- Fixed upfront payment: based on the certain value (existing business) where ZOPA exists
- Contingent payment: resolved later when we know who was right about the new software
- The earnout "carves out" the disputed contingency and reconstructs the ZOPA for the rest of the deal

**Economic logic:**
- Instead of fighting over expectations now, pay based on actual results later
- Seller gets more if they're right (software succeeds)
- Buyer pays less if they're right (software fails)
- Both parties can live with this structure

---

### E. What is the difference between an earnout and a contingent value right?

**Economically, they're the same. The difference is the context.**

**Earnout:**
- Used for **privately held companies** or subsidiaries of public companies
- Buyer makes supplemental payments directly to seller's shareholders if performance goals are met
- Buyer must be able to locate the shareholders to pay them
- Purely contractual arrangement

**Contingent Value Right (CVR):**
- Used when **seller is a public company**
- Buyer issues a security (tradable right) to seller's shareholders
- Security can be traded—shareholders don't have to hold it to get paid
- Functions like an earnout but in publicly traded form

**Key point:** Same economic structure (contingent payment based on future performance), different mechanics based on whether the seller is public or private.

---

### F. Do you think the relevant instrument here should be based on appraised value of the company in six months? Or on something else? Why?

**BASED ON SOMETHING ELSE—specifically, REVENUE from the new software.**

**Why NOT appraised value:**
- Appraisal introduces new disagreements: which appraiser? what methodology?
- Buyer might improve the company in other ways (better management, cost-cutting) that increase value
- Those improvements shouldn't count toward the earnout—they're Buyer's contribution
- Six months from now, parties might still disagree on valuation

**Why REVENUE (copies sold) is better:**
- **Objective and verifiable:** Number of copies sold is a hard number
- **Specific to the new software:** Tied directly to the performance of the asset in question
- **Harder to manipulate:** Sales are sales (though not impossible to manipulate—see Question 4)
- **Clear connection to the contingency:** The earnout measures exactly what the parties disagree about

**General principle:** Earnouts should be based on objective, specific performance metrics that are closely tied to the uncertain event, not overall valuation which can be affected by many factors.

## Question 2: Tennis Player Endorsement (Incentive-Based Compensation)

### The Scenario

**Ann** is an up-and-coming tennis player:
- Currently: Top 20 player (worth $100X annually in endorsement)
- Potential: Top 10 or even Top 3 player (worth $300X annually)
- Risks: Chokes in big matches, injured knee last year (uncertain recovery)
- Opportunity: Special line of tennis sneakers named for her

**Nickel** (sports apparel company) is negotiating with Ann:
- Bob is negotiating for Nickel
- Adonis (competitor) is also talking to Ann
- Nickel has many other prospects

---

### A. Why is the fixed payment hard to determine?

**BECAUSE ANN'S VALUE IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN.**

The problem is three-fold:

**1. Performance uncertainty:**
- Will she become Top 10? Top 3? Stay at Top 20?
- Her "choking" problem in big matters creates unpredictable results
- Performance determines how much revenue Nickel can generate from sponsoring her

**2. Injury risk:**
- Knee injury raises questions about her career trajectory
- Uncertain whether she'll fully recover
- A serious injury could make the endorsement worthless

**3. Competitive dynamics:**
- If she becomes a star, she's worth much more
- Adonis might also bid, driving up the price
- Nickel has alternatives, so they won't overpay

**The core problem:** Fixed compensation requires Nickel to estimate Ann's value today, but her value won't be known for years. If they guess wrong, one side loses.

---

### B. What alternatives can Bob consider in structuring a package for Ann?

**STRUCTURE A DEAL WITH BASE PAY PLUS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.**

**Proposed contract structure:**

**1. Fixed base payment:**
- $100X annually (appropriate for Top 20 player, where she is now)
- This compensates Ann for her current value
- Provides guaranteed income regardless of performance

**2. Performance-based bonuses:**
- Additional payment if she reaches Top 10 for a specified period
- Even more if she becomes Top 3
- Bonuses tied to rankings, tournament wins, or major finals appearances

**3. Product line revenue sharing:**
- Ann gets percentage of sales from her signature sneaker line
- Aligns incentives: if sneakers sell well because she performs well, she benefits
- Creates ongoing stake in the commercial success of the endorsement

**4. Term limits with renegotiation:**
- 3-5 year deal with option to renegotiate based on performance
- Protects both sides from being locked into bad deal if circumstances change
- Allows Nickel to extend at higher rate if she becomes a star

**5. Termination rights:**
- Nickel can terminate if long-term injury sidelines Ann
- Could include injury protection (partial payment if injury ends career)
- Balances Ann's need for security with Nickel's risk

**Why this works:**
- Nickel doesn't overpay for uncertainty
- Ann can still capture upside if she becomes a star
- Incentives are aligned: Ann performs well → Nickel makes money → Ann makes money
- Risk is allocated to the party best able to bear it based on information

## Question 3: Pharmaceutical Acquisition (Earnouts for Asymmetric Information and Incentives)

### The Scenario

**Christine** is CEO of **C-Pharma**, a startup developing **Nopain**:
- New painkiller: effective and not addictive
- Target market: surgery/serious injury patients (2-6 week pain relief)
- C-Pharma has no other drugs in development
- If successful: discounted revenue stream worth $300M+

**Dalia** is Head of Acquisitions at **Big-Pharma**:
- Considers bidding for C-Pharma
- Struggling to assess likelihood of success
- Multiple hurdles: effectiveness, side effects, timing vs. competitors, regulatory approval

---

### A. Why might Christine and Dalia make different predictions about these questions? If they do, what effect do their differences have on the ability to price the deal?

**THREE REASONS FOR DIFFERENT PREDICTIONS:**

**1. Information asymmetry:**
- Christine knows more about:
  - Drug development process and test results
  - Technical details about effectiveness
  - Early side effect data
  - Timeline for completion
- Dalia has limited access to this information (due diligence can only go so far)
- **Christine knows things Dalia doesn't**

**2. Optimism bias (founder's perspective):**
- Founders are naturally optimistic about their creations
- Christine has "skin in the game" and believes deeply in the drug
- This isn't necessarily dishonesty—it's genuine founder psychology
- **Christine believes things Dalia doesn't**

**3. Incentive to misrepresent:**
- Christine wants a higher purchase price
- Even if she has doubts, she has incentive to downplay them
- Dalia knows this and is skeptical of Christine's confidence
- **Christine says things she doesn't fully believe**

**Effect on pricing:**
- If Christine predicts success and Dalia predicts failure, no ZOPA exists
- Christine won't sell for less than her expected value
- Dalia won't pay more than her expected value
- The deal dies unless they can bridge the valuation gap

---

### B. What alternative can you suggest for Dalia to propose? Why does it help bridge the differences between Christine and Dalia?

**PROPOSE A FIXED PRICE AT THE LOW END PLUS AN EARNOUT AT THE HIGH END.**

**Structure:**
- Relatively low fixed payment (e.g., $50M-$100M) for C-Pharma today
- Large earnout payment (e.g., up to $200M+) if Nopain succeeds
- Earnout triggered by specific milestones (regulatory approval, sales targets)

**Why this bridges the gap:**

**From Christine's perspective:**
- Gets immediate value for her work to date (fixed payment)
- Still captures most of the upside if Nopain succeeds (earnout)
- Doesn't need to own the company to benefit from the drug's success
- Reduces her risk—she gets something even if drug fails

**From Dalia's perspective:**
- Pays modest amount for an uncertain asset (fixed payment)
- Only pays big if the drug actually works (earnout)
- Aligns price with actual performance, not uncertain predictions
- Reduces risk of overpaying for a drug that never makes it to market

**Economic logic:**
- The earnout removes the biggest source of disagreement (drug success) from the upfront price negotiation
- Both sides can agree on the fixed portion based on what's known today
- The contingent portion resolves later when we know who was right
- **ZOPA is reconstructed by carving out the contingency**

---

### C. Should your proposal in part "b" be based on several milestones or just one or two? Which ones would you pick and why?

**SEVERAL MILESTONES ARE BETTER—EACH ONE REMOVES A MAJOR SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY.**

**Recommended milestones:**

**1. Regulatory approval (FDA):**
- Why most important: Without approval, drug has zero value
- Earnout payment: Large bump upon approval
- This is the "binary" event—either drug gets approved or it doesn't
- Should be the largest earnout component

**2. Sales revenue at 6 months post-launch:**
- Proves drug is marketable
- Shows early commercial success
- Helps distinguish between drugs that work and drugs that work AND sell

**3. Sales revenue at 12 months post-launch:**
- Confirms sustained commercial viability
- Shows drug isn't being eclipsed by competitors
- Demonstrates real-world market position

**4. Side effect/litigation adjustment:**
- Deduct from earnout if serious side effects emerge
- Deduct litigation costs from patient injuries
- Protects against drugs that get approved but have hidden problems

**Why multiple milestones work better:**
- More accurate payment based on actual progress
- Reduces risk for both sides at each stage
- Creates incentives for Christine to stay engaged through development
- Allows for partial payment even if drug fails late in the process

---

### D. What signal do Christine and Dalia send in crafting a term like the one in "b"? Why might that be helpful?

**BOTH PARTIES SIGNAL CONFIDENCE, WHICH HELPS BRIDGE THE INFORMATION GAP.**

**Dalia's signal:**
- By offering an earnout, Dalia says: "I'm confident enough in C-Pharma's value that I'm willing to pay for it, but only if Nopain actually works"
- Signals she believes in the company outside of the uncertain drug
- Shows willingness to share upside with Christine
- Makes Christine a more willing seller

**Christine's signal:**
- By accepting a lower fixed price with earnout, Christine says: "I'm confident enough in Nopain that I'm willing to be paid based on actual results"
- Signals she believes the drug will succeed
- Shows she's not trying to cash out and run
- **Addresses Dalia's concern about incentive to misrepresent**

**Why this signaling helps:**
- Reduces Dalia's worry that Christine is overhyping the drug
- Christine wouldn't accept earnout if she thought the drug would fail
- Creates credibility on both sides
- The structure itself reveals private information through the willingness to accept contingent payment

---

### E. Is the term in "b" more or less helpful if Christine would stay on to run C-Pharma as a subsidiary of Big-Pharma?

**MORE HELPFUL—IT SOLVES AN ADDITIONAL PROBLEM (INCENTIVE ALIGNMENT).**

**Without Christine staying on:**
- Earnout solves information asymmetry problem only
- Once deal closes, Christine walks away
- Big-Pharma bears all risk of post-acquisition execution

**With Christine staying on:**
- Earnout solves BOTH information asymmetry AND incentive problems
- Christine has ongoing incentive to make Nopain succeed
- Her continued effort is tied to the earnout payment
- Reduces agency costs between Big-Pharma and the founder

**Why this matters:**
- Drug development requires ongoing effort through regulatory approval
- Christine's expertise and motivation matter for success
- If she's paid out and leaves, she might not work as hard
- Earnout keeps her "hungry" and aligned with Big-Pharma's success

**The trade-off:**
- Christine might want more cash upfront if she's committing to stay
- Big-Pharma might worry about her influence if she stays
- But overall, earnout + continued founder involvement is powerful combination

## Question 4: Whale-co/Minnow-co Acquisition (Earnout Problems and Manipulation)

### The Scenario

**Whale-co** makes widgets (earns $1B/year) and is considering acquiring **Minnow-co** (earns $30M/year).

**The complication:**
- Whale-co is acquiring 7 other companies with similar prospects
- Significant uncertainty about which, if any, will succeed
- Minnow-co makes specialized widgets that Whale-co sees as a new revenue source
- Whale-co thinks of Minnow-co as just "one possible direction"

---

### A. If Whale-co wants to incorporate an earnout in the offer, would a revenue-based earnout make sense? Or a profit-based earnout? What are the advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches?

**PROFIT-BASED EARNOUT IS ECONOMICALLY BETTER BUT REVENUE-BASED IS MORE PRACTICAL.**

**Profit-based earnout (payment based on revenue minus expenses):**

**Advantages:**
- **More accurate measure of value creation:** Profit reflects what the business actually contributes
- **Aligns with economic reality:** A business that generates revenue but loses money isn't creating value
- **Preferred by buyers:** They pay based on net economic contribution

**Disadvantages:**
- **Harder to measure and verify:** Profit calculations are complex
- **Easier to manipulate:** Buyer can allocate costs to the earnout business unit
- **Creates disputes:** Which costs count? How do you allocate shared expenses?

**Revenue-based earnout (payment based on percentage of revenue):**

**Advantages:**
- **Easier to measure and verify:** Revenue is a straightforward number
- **Harder to manipulate:** Sales are sales (though not impossible—see below)
- **Preferred by sellers:** More predictable and transparent
- **Reduces disputes:** Clear metric with less room for argument

**Disadvantages:**
- **Less accurate measure of value:** Revenue doesn't account for costs
- **Can incentivize bad behavior:** Seller might push short-term revenue at expense of profit
- **May overpay:** Business might generate revenue but lose money

**The Whale-co/Minnow-co specific problem:**
- Whale-co controls cost allocation once Minnow-co is a subsidiary
- Whale-co has incentive to allocate costs to Minnow-co to reduce profit-based earnout
- "Let's assign some of our corporate overhead to Minnow-co"
- "Let's charge Minnow-co for shared marketing at inflated rates"
- **Whale-co can inflate Minnow-co's costs to reduce earnout payments**

**Result:** Even though profit-based is economically better, **revenue-based might be used in practice** because it's harder to manipulate.

---

### B. Why might the Minnow-co management worry about depending too heavily on an earnout in this situation? How might Whale-co have a conflict of interest?

**MINNOW-CO SHOULD WORRY—WHALE-CO HAS CONFLICTING INCENTIVES AND CONTROL.**

**Why Minnow-co should worry:**

**1. Whale-co is acquiring 8 companies total:**
- All 8 sellers are competing for Whale-co's attention and resources
- Whale-co can only push some products, not all
- Minnow-co's earnout depends on Whale-co's decisions to prioritize it

**2. Whale-co controls marketing and sales efforts:**
- Whale-co decides which products to feature in catalog
- Whale-co allocates sales team attention
- Whale-co chooses which products to advertise
- These decisions determine Minnow-co's revenue (and thus earnout)

**3. Whale-co's conflict of interest:**
- Whale-co wants to minimize total earnout payments across all 8 acquisitions
- If Whale-co promotes Product A (with no earnout) over Product B (with large earnout), they save money
- Whale-co might make strategic choices that reduce earnout payments:
  - "Product A from Company X is better, let's focus on that"
  - "Market conditions favor Product C, let's prioritize that"
  - Either legitimate OR self-interested justification

**The agency cost:** Whale-co controls Minnow-co's earnout fate post-closing. This creates moral hazard—Whale-co can benefit at Minnow-co's expense by making decisions that reduce the earnout.

---

### C. Why is it challenging to pick a length of time for the earnout period? What are the risks if it's short? If it's long?

**TIMING IS A ZERO-SUM GAME BETWEEN BUYER AND SELLER.**

**Why it's challenging:**
- The success timeline is uncertain (that's the whole problem)
- No one knows how long it will take for the product to succeed (or if it will)
- Both sides have legitimate arguments for different time periods

**If the earnout period is TOO SHORT:**

**Problems for Minnow-co:**
- Product might not have time to gain traction
- Earnout expires just as product starts selling well
- Whale-co could "starve" the product of attention during earnout period, then promote it after
- **Seller is robbed of revenue they're entitled to**

**Problems for Whale-co:**
- Might end up paying for luck (short-term fluke) rather than true success
- Doesn't give product enough time to prove real value

**If the earnout period is TOO LONG:**

**Problems for Whale-co:**
- Earnout starts measuring Whale-co's contributions, not just Minnow-co's
- Whale-co might improve the product, expand distribution, reduce costs—should Minnow-co get paid for that?
- Seller gets paid for buyer's value creation
- **Buyer pays more than seller's contribution justifies**

**Problems for Minnow-co:**
- Whale-co has more time to manipulate the earnout
- Whale-co can delay success until period expires

**The incentive problem:**
- Whale-co has incentive to advocate for SHORT period (less likely to pay)
- Minnow-co has incentive to advocate for LONG period (more likely to pay)
- Both have legitimate arguments, making compromise difficult

---

### D. Whale-co is buying a number of different companies. Why might this be a red flag to Minnow-co, as its management considers whether to agree to an earnout?

**MULTIPLE ACQUISITIONS CREATE COMPETITION FOR BUYER'S ATTENTION—A MAJOR RED FLAG.**

**Why this is a red flag:**

**1. All sellers are competing for the same resources:**
- Whale-co's sales team can only push so many products
- Whale-co's marketing budget is finite
- Whale-co's management attention is limited
- Only some of the 8 companies will get real support

**2. Whale-co's incentives are skewed:**
- Whale-co will prioritize products that minimize total earnout payments
- If Minnow-co has a generous earnout and another company has a stingy earnout (or no earnout), Whale-co favors the other
- **Whale-co can reduce earnout payments by strategic choice of which products to promote**

**3. "Good faith" vs. "Self-interested" justifications:**
- Whale-co can claim: "We promoted Product A because it's better" (even if they promoted it to avoid earnout)
- Whale-co can claim: "Market conditions favor Product B" (even if earnout structure influenced the decision)
- Hard for Minnow-co to prove Whale-co is acting in bad faith

**4. Information problem:**
- Minnow-co doesn't know what earnout terms the other 7 companies got
- Minnow-co doesn't know Whale-co's internal priorities
- Minnow-co is negotiating blind about the competitive landscape

**Bottom line:** When you're one of many, your earnout depends on buyer decisions that you can't control and can't monitor. This is exactly the kind of agency cost that makes earnouts problematic.

---

### E. To what extent can the problems in "d" be addressed by a reasonableness term in the contract? Or by specifying who makes management decisions?

**CONTRACTUAL FIXES HELP AT THE MARGINS BUT DON'T SOLVE THE CORE PROBLEM.**

**Reasonableness term:**

**What it would look like:**
- "Whale-co will use commercially reasonable efforts to promote Minnow-co's products"
- "Whale-co will allocate marketing resources fairly among all acquired companies"

**Why it helps (a little):**
- Creates some legal obligation
- Prevents overt abuse (total neglect of Minnow-co's products)
- May deter the most egregious manipulation

**Why it doesn't solve the problem:**
- **"Reasonable efforts" is incredibly vague** and hard to enforce
- Whale-co can always claim business judgment: "We genuinely thought Product A was a better bet"
- Hard to prove Whale-co acted unreasonably in good faith business decisions
- Litigation is expensive and destroys the relationship
- **You can contract around agency costs, but you can't eliminate them when one party controls the asset**

**Specifying management decisions:**

**What it would look like:**
- Minnow-co's management stays on and controls product decisions
- Whale-co agrees not to interfere with certain product strategies
- Decision rights allocated to Minnow-co for earnout-related matters

**Why it helps:**
- If Minnow-co controls decisions, Whale-co can't manipulate the earnout
- Minnow-co's management has incentive to maximize earnout
- Reduces Whale-co's ability to divert attention to other products

**Why it creates new problems:**
- Whale-co won't give up control—it's acquiring Minnow-co, after all
- If Minnow-co controls decisions, Whale-co loses the benefits of ownership
- Whale-co won't pay for an asset it can't control
- If Minnow-co makes bad product decisions, Whale-co suffers
- **Allocating decision rights creates new agency costs in the opposite direction**

**The tension:**
- If Whale-co controls → Minnow-co worries about manipulation
- If Minnow-co controls → Whale-co worries about bad decisions
- There's no perfect allocation of control when incentives diverge

---

### F. What other ideas do K & S mention and what problems do they identify with them?

**(K & S = Klein and Saunders, the casebook authors)**

**Other ideas and their problems:**

**1. Independent auditors/verification:**
- Use third-party accountants to verify earnout calculations
- Helps prevent outright manipulation of numbers
- **Problem:** Can't prevent manipulation of underlying business decisions (which products to promote)

**2. Arbitration/dispute resolution:**
- Include arbitration clause for earnout disputes
- Faster/cheaper than litigation
- **Problem:** Still adversarial; damages hard to calculate; relationship damage

**3. Anti-manipulation covenants:**
- Contractual promises not to take specific actions to reduce earnout
- E.g., "Whale-co won't discontinue Minnow-co products during earnout period"
- **Problem:** Can't anticipate every form of manipulation; hard to enforce

**4. Milestone-based earnouts (vs. continuous):**
- Pay earnout based on hitting specific targets (e.g., $10M revenue in Year 1)
- Clearer triggers for payment
- **Problem:** Creates cliff effects; incentives to game specific milestones

**K & S's broader observation:**
- **Earnouts are used less than you might expect** because they're so hard to design well
- Every solution to an earnout problem creates new problems
- Earnouts work best in specific, narrow circumstances (more on this in Question 6)

---

## Question 5: K & S's Position on Earnouts

### Did K & S recommend the use of earnouts or not? What position do you think they were taking? Did you agree with it?

**K & S RECOMMEND CAUTION—EARNOUTS SHOULD BE USED RARELY AND IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES.**

**K & S's position:**
- Earnouts are a legitimate tool for bridging valuation gaps
- BUT they're difficult to design without creating new information and incentive problems
- They recommend earnouts only when certain conditions are met (see Question 6)
- They're skeptical of earnouts in most acquisition contexts

**Their reasoning:**
1. **Information problem → Earnout solution → NEW information/incentive problems**
   - The earnout paradox: the solution creates the problems it was meant to solve
2. **Measurement challenges:** Hard to define metrics that can't be manipulated
3. **Control issues:** Buyer controls the asset post-closing and can game the system
4. **Agency costs:** Buyer's interests diverge from seller's interests once deal closes

**Do I agree?**

**YES—their position is economically sound.**

**Why K & S are right:**
- Earnouts look great in theory but are messy in practice
- The problem is not designing the earnout—it's enforcing it
- Once the seller has sold, they have no leverage
- The buyer controls the asset and can "technically comply" while substantially reducing the earnout
- Litigation is expensive and relationships matter

**Counterpoint (when earnouts DO work):**
- When there's a clear, objective milestone (regulatory approval of a drug)
- When the asset is freestanding and won't be deeply integrated
- When the earnout period is short and the milestone is binary (happens or doesn't)
- When both parties' incentives are aligned (both want the milestone to occur)

**Bottom line:** Earnouts are a specialized tool, not a general solution. Use them when they fit the specific circumstances, avoid them when they don't. K & S's caution is warranted.

---

## Question 6: When Are Earnouts Most/Least Effective?

### In what situations will earnouts be most effective? When will they be least effective? Why?

**THE KEY DISTINGUISHING FACTOR: CONTROL OVER THE EARNOUT METRIC.**

---

**EARNOUTS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN:**

**1. The metric is outside both parties' control (freestanding event):**
- **Best example:** Regulatory approval of a drug
  - Neither buyer nor seller controls the FDA
  - Both parties want approval (incentives aligned)
  - Approval is binary: happens or doesn't
  - Hard to manipulate
- **Other examples:**
  - Patent approval
  - Landing a big customer (customer decides, not the parties)
  - Zoning approval for real estate development

**2. The asset will remain freestanding (low integration needed):**
- Seller's business will operate independently after acquisition
- Buyer won't integrate it into existing operations
- Performance can be clearly attributed to the seller's asset
- Harder for buyer to manipulate results

**3. Clear, objective, verifiable metrics:**
- Revenue targets (harder to manipulate than profit)
- Specific customer milestones
- Binary events (approval/no approval)
- Minimal room for judgment in measurement

**4. Short earnout period:**
- Reduces time for manipulation
- Tied to specific near-term events
- Measures seller's contribution, not buyer's later efforts

**5. Both parties' incentives are aligned:**
- Both want the milestone to occur
- Buyer doesn't benefit from avoiding earnout payment
- Success is win-win, not zero-sum

---

**EARNOUTS ARE LEAST EFFECTIVE WHEN:**

**1. High integration is necessary:**
- Seller's business will be deeply integrated into buyer's operations
- Hard to separate seller's contribution from buyer's efforts
- Buyer can "bury" seller's product within larger business
- Performance becomes ambiguous

**2. Buyer has discretion over performance:**
- Buyer controls marketing, pricing, distribution
- Buyer decides which products to prioritize
- Buyer can allocate costs to earnout business unit
- **Buyer can manipulate the metric while claiming legitimate business reasons**

**3. Multiple competing acquisitions:**
- Buyer acquires several similar assets (like Whale-co buying 8 companies)
- Assets compete for buyer's attention and resources
- Buyer will prioritize assets with favorable earnout terms
- Seller is at mercy of buyer's internal allocation decisions

**4. Metrics are subjective or manipulable:**
- Profit-based earnouts (easy to allocate costs)
- "Success" defined vaguely
- Metrics requiring judgment to calculate
- Room for argument over whether milestone was achieved

**5. Long earnout periods:**
- Extends time for manipulation
- Starts measuring buyer's contributions, not just seller's
- Buyer can delay efforts until period expires
- Creates ongoing agency costs

**THE PRINCIPLE:**

**Earnouts work best when the earnout metric is outside the buyer's control.**

- Drug approval: Works (FDA decides)
- Product sales in integrated business: Problematic (buyer decides which products to push)
- Freestanding subsidiary revenue: Better (clear attribution)
- Cost allocation/manipulation: Worst (buyer controls)

---

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR EXAMS:**

When you see an earnout question, ask:
1. Who controls the thing the earnout is based on?
2. Can the buyer manipulate this metric post-closing?
3. Are incentives aligned or adversarial?
4. Is the asset freestanding or will it be integrated?
5. Is the milestone objective or subjective?

Your analysis should flow from these questions.

## Key Takeaways

### Theme 1: The Earnout Paradox
- Earnouts solve information and incentive problems BUT create new information and incentive problems
- This is why they're used less often than you'd expect
- Every solution to an earnout problem creates new problems

### Theme 2: When Earnouts Work
- **Best case:** Freestanding asset, objective milestone (e.g., drug approval), outside buyer's control
- **Worst case:** Integrated asset, buyer controls performance, multiple competing acquisitions
- **Key question:** Who controls the earnout metric after closing?

### Theme 3: Two Core Uses
1. **Bridging valuation gaps:** When parties disagree about value due to uncertainty (Software company, C-Pharma)
2. **Incentive alignment:** When seller's ongoing effort matters (Christine staying on at Big-Pharma)

### Theme 4: Revenue vs. Profit Earnouts
- **Profit-based:** Economically accurate but easily manipulated (cost allocation)
- **Revenue-based:** Less accurate but harder to manipulate
- **Reality:** Revenue-based often used despite economic flaws because it's more practical

### Theme 5: Measurement Problems
- Appraised value: Too subjective, creates new disagreements
- Revenue/profit: Can be manipulated by buyer post-closing
- Objective milestones: Best but limited to specific circumstances

### Theme 6: Multiple Acquisitions Red Flag
- When buyer acquires several similar assets, sellers compete for attention
- Buyer will prioritize assets with favorable earnout terms
- This creates agency costs that are nearly impossible to contract around

### Core Insight:

> **Earnouts reconstruct the ZOPA by carving out contingencies, but they work best when the contingencies are outside the buyer's control. When the buyer can manipulate the earnout metric, the solution creates the problem it was meant to solve.**

## Notes for Class Discussion

- **Be ready to calculate ZOPA with and without contingencies** (Question 1)
- **Distinguish information asymmetry from uncertainty**—they require different solutions (Question 1C)
- **Know the earnout vs. CVR distinction**—same economics, different context (Question 1E)
- **Think about signaling:** Why does accepting an earnout signal confidence? (Question 3D)
- **Agency costs framework:** Who controls what? Who benefits from manipulation? (Question 4)
- **Best/worst cases for earnouts:** Be ready to apply the framework to new scenarios (Question 6)

---

**Exam focus:**
- Understand when earnouts work and when they don't
- Be able to identify manipulation risks post-closing
- Connect earnout design to the three core problems (information, incentives, uncertainty)
- Use the "who controls the metric?" framework for analysis
