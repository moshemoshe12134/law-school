# Class 10 Prep Sheet: Nonprofits — Measuring and Rewarding Progress (Panel 3)

**Course:** Deals  
**Topic:** Why Nonprofits Are Harder Than VC: Measuring Performance, Incentives, and Inertia  
**Date:** 2026-03-25

---

## Key Concepts Overview

Nonprofits can be a **solution** to information problems (nondistribution constraint builds trust), but they also create a core difficulty:

**Fundamental nonprofit challenge:** success is hard to measure. Without a profit/stock price metric, decision‑makers have more discretion, and outsiders have a harder time distinguishing “good” from “self‑serving” choices.

That measurement gap amplifies:
- **Information problems:** boards/donors can’t easily evaluate program choices.
- **Incentive problems:** managers can pursue comfort/status/perks, and inertia is harder to dislodge.

The **nondistribution constraint** helps, but it’s **leaky**: managers can still extract private benefits (compensation not tied to surplus, prestige, travel, staffing, office space, nepotism, etc.).

## Question 1: Review — Venture Capital Challenges

### A. What information problems exist in venture capital?

- **Information asymmetry:** founders know more about the business than investors.
- **Uncertainty:** even insiders don’t know whether a new product/market will work.

### B. What incentive problems exist in venture capital?

- Founders may **overstate** prospects to raise money.
- After funding, founders may **shirk** or pursue private benefits unless incentives/monitoring are aligned.

### C. Do information problems make incentive problems harder?

**YES.** When outcomes are hard to observe and evaluate, managers have more room to act in their own interests without being detected.

## Question 2: Comparing For‑Profit vs Nonprofit Vetting

### A. Forprofit Corp (restaurant vs catering)

#### i. First question Alice should ask?

**Which business is more profitable?** In a for‑profit, the bottom line is the first screen.

#### ii. Why might Ben hide that the restaurant requires more work?

Because he may want the **easier job** (private benefit) and will present a “business” rationale that’s hard to falsify without data.

#### iii. If workload is the real motive, can Alice figure it out?

**Often YES.** Profitability (and related metrics) makes it feasible to test whether shutting the restaurant is actually good for the firm.

### B. Nonprofit (soup kitchen vs basketball program)

#### c. Is Candace’s plan easier or harder to vet than Ben’s?

**Harder.** There is no single profit metric to compare the “return” of soup kitchen vs basketball in mission terms.

#### d–e. Why might Candace hide that soup kitchen is more work? How feasible is it for Alice to detect?

- Candace may hide workload because Alice might infer Candace is choosing the option that reduces effort rather than maximizing mission.
- Detecting this is **harder** than in a for‑profit because performance measurement is more contested and less quantitative.

#### f. What is the fundamental problem emphasized in *How to Save the World*?

**Measuring success is hard.**
- **Information:** the board can’t reliably tell which programs work best.
- **Incentives:** ambiguity gives managers cover to choose what they prefer (comfort, prestige, ideology).

Parallel to VC: both involve uncertainty/asymmetric information; VC uses **high‑powered incentives** (equity) as a partial solution, while nonprofits can’t tie compensation to surplus in the same way.

## Question 3: Inertia

### A. Is it practical to rethink SOPs every morning?

**NO.** Standard operating procedures are necessary to coordinate work.

### B. Does every organization need SOPs?

**YES.**

### C. Why might people resist changing SOPs even when conditions change?

- Switching costs (time/training).
- Comfort and status quo bias.
- Loss of departmental power/perquisites.
- Fear of being blamed if experimentation fails.

### D. Is inertia a bigger challenge at nonprofits?

**Often YES.**
- Less clear performance feedback (no profits).
- Less competitive pressure to adapt.
- Mission‑driven environments can become dogmatic (“our way is morally correct”), increasing resistance to change.

### E. Is inertia information, incentives, or both?

**Both.**
- **Information:** hard to tell which changes improve mission outcomes.
- **Incentives:** people often benefit privately from keeping things the same.

---

## Question 4: Resolving Conflicts

### A. Why might disagreements be more heated at a nonprofit?

- **Ambiguity:** no shared metric to settle disputes.
- **Values/identity:** people are there because they care, so fights become fights over principle.
- **Measurement problem:** “who’s right?” is harder to determine.

### B. Why is compromise harder?

Because compromise can feel like **betraying the mission**, and because the bargaining space is less clearly defined without a shared metric.

## Question 5: How Effective Is the Nondistribution Constraint?

### A. If CK runs a surplus, can Marvin and Natalie take it as a dividend?

**NO.** The surplus cannot be distributed to control persons.

### B. Which statement is true?

**(vi) is the key one:** Marvin **cannot** receive a bonus equal to **5% of the surplus** each year (it looks like a dividend).

The others are not categorically barred by the nonprofit form:
- board members can sometimes be compensated;
- nonprofits can spend on office space/travel;
- nepotism/perquisites are possible (even if bad governance).

### C. How reliable is the nondistribution constraint in preventing skimping/overcharging?

**Only somewhat reliable.**
- It blocks blatant dividends.
- It does not eliminate agency costs or stop value extraction through perks, inflated pay (not tied to surplus), cushy jobs, or mission‑drift decisions that are hard to detect.

## Question 6: Incentive Compensation

### A. Role of incentive compensation in VC; why?

VC uses high‑powered incentives (equity/options) to:
- align founder and investor incentives;
- make the founder “self‑monitor” when outsiders can’t observe effort/quality.

### B. Can nonprofits use the same compensation strategy?

**NO (not in the same form).** Nonprofits cannot give managers a claim on residual surplus the way equity does.

### C. Can nonprofits set goals and reward employees for achieving them?

**YES (with constraints).**
- They can use **mission‑related KPIs** (fundraising targets; clients served; program outputs).
- They **cannot** tie compensation to “take a percentage of the surplus.”

### D. Why is KPI‑style compensation hard?

Because mission success is hard to measure:
- KPIs can be gamed (optimize the metric, not the mission).
- Outputs may be easier to count than outcomes, but may mislead.

### E. For‑profit hospital CEO (Peter): how can the board motivate profit doubling?

- Use performance‑based compensation (bonus/equity) tied to profit targets.
- The board itself has incentives to press for performance (reputation, compensation, fiduciary duties, market pressure).

### F. Nonprofit hospital CEO (Quentin): can the board motivate the same way? What substitutes exist?

**Not the same way.**
- No equity‑style claim on surplus.
- Substitutes: mission commitment, professional norms, reputation, internal culture.

Board incentives: nonprofit boards are usually unpaid, so motivation comes from mission/reputation rather than financial upside.

## Question 7: Agency Costs — “There’s No Substitute for Being There”

### A. For‑profit restaurants: what information helps the board evaluate Richard vs Sally’s travel model?

Track **outcomes over time**:
- profitability and costs (including travel expense);
- turnover and performance at locations;
- whether best practices are actually being shared;
- whether remote oversight is catching problems early.

### B. Nonprofit welfare centers: is evaluating Tina harder?

**Harder.** The board still wants comparative data (service quality, beneficiary outcomes, costs), but mission outcomes are harder to quantify than restaurant profits.

---

## Question 8: “Best Nonprofits” — Two Tasks and Synergies

### A. What two goals must nonprofits pursue to solve information/incentive problems?

1. **Analysis/strategy:** figure out the best way to advance the mission (data, alternatives, prioritization).
2. **Buy‑in/coordination:** get the organization (staff/board/donors) aligned to implement the strategy.

### B. What synergies exist between these goals?

- Better analysis makes buy‑in easier because the plan is more persuasive.
- A planning/buy‑in process generates information from the organization (surfacing constraints and ideas), improving the strategy.
- Credible strategy can attract more donor support.

---

## Key Takeaways

- The nonprofit problem is not “bad people”; it’s **measurement**: fewer hard metrics → more discretion → harder monitoring.
- The nondistribution constraint is useful but **not airtight**.
- Inertia and conflict are amplified when there’s no shared way to measure success.
- The practical fix is governance/process: structured evaluation, credible KPIs, and planning that produces both information and buy‑in.

## Notes for Class Discussion

- When comparing programs, start by naming what’s missing: **no profit metric** → need alternative measurement.
- Treat the nondistribution constraint as a partial solution with leakage: “blocks dividends, not perks.”
- For any “board oversight” hypo: ask what **data** the board can collect and what **incentives** managers have to shape it.
