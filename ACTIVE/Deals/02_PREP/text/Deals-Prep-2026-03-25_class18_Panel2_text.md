## Key Concepts Overview (the Deals lens)

This unit is the course’s thesis applied to one industry:

1. **Uncertainty:** nobody can reliably predict whether a movie will be a hit before release; ex post demand information arrives during the run.
2. **Information asymmetry:** parties have different information (e.g., exhibitor has local market knowledge; distributor has some inside view of the film), but the “inside” info is often unreliable ex ante.
3. **Incentives + hold-up:** parties perform at different times (sunk production costs; exhibitors invest in theaters/marketing; distributors allocate prints/screens), so each side can exploit the other after performance starts.

The recurring move: when detailed contracting is hard, the industry leans on:
- **Relational contracting** (repeat play, reputation, “do the right thing or we punish later”)
- **Organizational solutions** (including **vertical integration**) that can “complete” incomplete contracts
- **Contract terms** that look anticompetitive at first glance (minimum ticket price; clearances; block booking), but also have plausible efficiency explanations tied to uncertainty + monitoring + incentives

## Question 1: Demand for Specific Movies (De Vany)

### 1A. What drives demand? What role does dissemination of information play?

De Vany’s basic claim is that movies are an **information industry**: audiences don’t really know what they like until they see it, and then they **transmit information** (reviews, rankings, word of mouth) that shifts demand.

Demand drivers to have ready:
- **Pre-release signals:** stars, budget, advertising, “opening screens,” genre/franchise reputation.
- **Post-release information:** word of mouth + box office rankings and other public signals; the audience’s information aggregates and “locks in” hits vs misses over time.
- **Tournament dynamic:** attention is scarce; movies compete week-to-week; winners take a disproportionate share.

### 1B. Key moment: the opening, or something else?

Not just the opening. The opening week matters, but De Vany emphasizes that demand becomes much more **information-driven after release** (as people learn from others’ experience). A useful way to say it in class:

- **Early run:** audiences rely more on public signals (marketing + rankings).
- **Later run:** word-of-mouth information dominates; “legs” matter.

### 1C. Bell curve? Why or why not?

**NO.** De Vany rejects the “normal/bell curve” intuition. Movie revenues are **heavy-tailed**: a small number of blockbusters account for a large share of total revenue/profit, and there is no stable “typical” movie outcome.

### 1D. Uncertainty or asymmetric information? What’s the difference?

De Vany’s emphasis is **uncertainty** (the key thing is unknown to everyone ex ante). Distinction:

- **Uncertainty:** nobody knows the true demand before release.
- **Asymmetric information:** someone knows something relevant (or credibly knows more), and the other side doesn’t (e.g., local demand; effort levels; truthful reporting).

### 1E. How effective are producers at predicting success? Is that universally shared?

De Vany is skeptical: forecasting is hard and errors can be large because outcomes don’t behave like “normal” risk. But the industry still behaves as if forecasting is possible (greenlighting, marketing strategy), so his view is not universally shared in practice.

### 1F. Is it controversial to say ex post evidence beats ex ante prediction?

**Mostly NO.** That’s basic: once the movie is out, you observe real demand signals. The only controversy is degree:
- Some pre-release signals are informative (stars, franchise), but they don’t eliminate the core uncertainty.

## Question 2: Vertical Integration as a Response to Uncertainty and Asymmetric Information (Hanssen + De Vany)

### 2A. Why make commitments about exhibiting before release?

Because exhibition capacity is scarce and scheduling is real:
- theaters need to plan programming and marketing;
- distributors need to plan release strategy and allocate prints/screens;
- commitments reduce coordination failures (nobody invests in marketing if nobody knows the movie will be shown).

### 2B. Downside of committing before release?

You’re contracting under uncertainty:
- you may overbook a flop or underbook a sleeper hit;
- you can get locked into a run length that turns out inefficient;
- ex post, both sides want to renegotiate, which creates strategic behavior.

### 2C. Why is it hard to draft a contract mechanism that shortens/lengthens runs?

Because the “right” run length depends on information that is hard to specify and verify ex ante:
- demand reveals itself gradually and locally;
- you can’t write a complete state-contingent contract without creating new incentive problems;
- a formal enforcement system is hard: penalty clauses have to deter opportunism without killing efficient replacement.

### 2D. Who has better information about quality? How reliable is it?

The distributor/producers may have more information about inputs (cast, script, production values), but **quality-to-demand mapping is unreliable ex ante**. Post-release, exhibitors learn quickly from observed attendance and local feedback.

### 2E. Who has better information about the audience? How reliable is it?

The theater owner has an edge on **local audience** conditions (neighborhood preferences; competing attractions), but it’s still imperfect—especially for new films where tastes are unstable.

### 2F–H. Hanssen’s three “needs” met by vertical integration (why VI can “complete” the contract)

Hanssen’s thesis: vertical integration helped efficient ex post run-length adjustments without a fully specified contract by:

1. **Acting as a de facto side payment** (reducing film-by-film haggling), because an integrated firm can share surplus across stages when films are swapped/replaced.
2. **Reducing information asymmetries** that would otherwise cause too many/too few replacements.
3. **Making the informal arrangement self-enforcing** through reciprocity across integrated chains (you let me replace mine; I let you replace yours).

### 2I. What did Hanssen find empirically?

He finds evidence consistent with the story that integrated ownership was associated with **more frequent ex post run-length adjustment**, especially abbreviating unexpectedly unpopular films (a proxy for “responsive adaptation to new information”).

### 2J. If VI is illegal, what else can the industry do to use ex post evidence?

**Sequential release (“platforming”).** Start in a limited set of theaters/markets, learn demand, then expand if the data look good. This trades off:
- better information before national rollout,
- against slower diffusion and different bargaining dynamics.

### 2K. True/False: VI can respond to uncertainty and asymmetric information.

**TRUE.** Even if it also can be used anticompetitively, the efficiency story is completely plausible on Deals premises.

### 2L. Where else did we see organizations substitute for contracts?

Examples from earlier in the course:
- **Venture capital:** staged financing, board control, equity incentives (organizational governance instead of complete contracts).
- **Nonprofits:** nondistribution constraint and governance as a response to “contract failure.”

## Question 3: Cooperation, Trust, and Hold-Up (De Vany-style strategic opportunities)

### 3A. After producers’ costs are sunk, is it rational to accept unfavorable terms for a specific movie?

**YES.** Once costs are sunk, the producer compares “bad deal” vs “no deal.” If the bad deal yields some recovery above zero, it can be rational in the short run.

### 3B. Does that affect willingness to make future movies?

**YES.** If producers anticipate post-sunk exploitation, they invest less ex ante. This is classic hold-up: expected ex post bargaining can shrink ex ante output.

### 3C. True/false: exhibitors want great terms now but want producers alive long-term.

**TRUE.** Short-term surplus extraction can kill the ecosystem that supplies future product.

### 3D. Once an exhibitor commits to show a film, does the distributor have incentive to license to nearby competitors? Does it affect future dealings?

**YES.** The distributor may want to expand distribution to capture more revenue, but doing so can cannibalize the exhibitor’s returns and destroy trust. That can reduce exhibitors’ willingness to commit early next time.

### 3E. True/false: distributors want wide licensing short-run but selective long-run.

**TRUE.** Short-run revenue maximization can conflict with the need to maintain repeat-play relationships and preserve the value of exclusivity/priority in future releases.

### 3F. If exhibitors share revenue with producers, do exhibitors capture full gains from investing in theater quality?

**NO (not fully).** If the exhibitor only keeps part of incremental ticket revenue (because it shares), its incentive to invest in cleanliness/experience is diluted unless there are offsetting benefits (reputation; concession revenue; future bargaining leverage).

### 3G. Distributor leverage to get paid on time: occasional vs regular stream; does repeat play help?

If distributors have a **regular pipeline**, they can threaten future access (no next movie; worse terms; delayed delivery). Repeat play makes self-enforcement credible and supports relational contracting.

### 3H. True/false: creative contracting + organizational approaches are needed.

**TRUE.** This is the course’s core proposition applied to an industry with extreme uncertainty + repeated interactions.

## Question 4: Minimum Ticket Price (Paramount; antitrust story vs efficiency story)

### 4A. Defend the Court: why could minimum ticket prices be illegal price fixing?

Minimum prices can:
- reduce price competition among theaters (especially if used broadly and uniformly);
- function like coordinated resale price maintenance that keeps consumer prices high;
- be a mechanism for monitoring/enforcing collusion (if everyone must post the same minimums, deviations are easier to spot).

### 4B. Does easy entry strengthen or weaken the Court’s argument? What does De Vany suggest?

Easy entry generally **weakens** the monopoly/price-fixing story (new theaters can undercut and discipline pricing). De Vany argues entry into exhibition (and into production/distribution) was **open enough** that sustained monopoly pricing is hard to square with the market structure.

### 4C–F. Revenue-sharing logic; exclusive vs multiple exhibitors; why minimum price can be efficient

Setup: Danny gets 50% of ticket revenue after costs.

**4D. Why percentage of ticket sales instead of fixed price?**
- **Uncertainty:** ticket revenue is unknown ex ante; sharing spreads risk.
- **Incentives:** revenue share encourages both sides to care about turnout (distributor marketing; exhibitor effort).
- **Information:** contingent structure can reduce adverse selection relative to a fixed upfront fee.

**4E. Downside of licensing only to Ellen**
- limits output (fewer screens), so you may leave demand unsatisfied;
- gives Ellen market power over access in that neighborhood/time;
- slows discovery/learning if the movie isn’t tested broadly.

**4F. Risk of licensing to Ellen + Eddie; why minimum ticket price helps; why “customary”**
- risk: exhibitors compete by cutting ticket price, which can reduce total ticket revenue and cannibalize each other.
- because Danny shares ticket revenue but (typically) not concessions, exhibitors also have reasons to shift value away from tickets.
- a minimum ticket price (set at the customary price) can preserve the revenue base and reduce strategic manipulation while avoiding “supracompetitive” pricing.

---

## Question 5: Tickets + snack promotion (diverting revenue away from the shared pool)

Ellen’s $8 ticket + $5 snack bundle can harm Danny because it shifts consumer payments from:
- **tickets (shared with Danny)** to
- **concessions (kept by Ellen)**.

Contract protections Danny can demand:
- define “box office receipts” to include the value of bundled discounts (or allocate bundle revenue);
- require **no discounts** below a stated minimum ticket price without distributor approval;
- audit rights + reporting covenants around promotions.

---

## Question 6: Cheating on reported numbers; does minimum price help?

Two numbers Ellen can understate:
1. **Quantity** of tickets sold.
2. **Price** per ticket (including discounting/comping tricks).

A minimum price helps only on #2 (it bounds price understatement). It does not solve #1. For #1, Danny needs:
- audit rights, standardized reporting, third-party verification, penalties for misreporting.

---

## Question 7: Clearance (what it is; why it can be efficient; why courts still worry)

### 7A. What is clearance?

**Clearance** is a distributor’s commitment to an exhibitor not to license the same film to nearby theaters for a time window (protecting the exhibitor’s play date/run).

### 7B.i. Two-week clearance for a single film: acceptable?

**Likely YES.** It’s limited in duration and plausibly protects the exhibitor’s investment in marketing/showing the film without foreclosing the market for long.

### 7B.ii. Ten consecutive movies: would the Court be suspicious?

**More likely YES.** A uniform, multi-movie clearance can look like systematic foreclosure of rivals rather than case-by-case efficiency.

### 7B.iii. Defend multi-movie clearance; is stability always anticompetitive? What does De Vany suggest?

Defense:
- theater characteristics that drive efficient clearance (location, size, quality) are stable, so uniformity can be **predictable and low-transaction-cost** rather than conspiratorial;
- stable relationships can support **trust/reputation** and ex post flexibility.

De Vany’s point: even in a stable run/clearance system, **actual run length is variable** (flops get cut; hits hold over), so “uniformity” in the initial allocation doesn’t imply rigidity or collusion.

### 7B.iv. Is run length certain ex ante? Relevance to antitrust analysis?

**NO.** Run length is uncertain because demand is revealed during the run. That matters because the economic function of the system is to enable adaptation to new information, not just to lock in market structure.

### 7B.v. Holdover conflicts: how does Ellen handle conflicting commitments? Studio-era practice?

When a film hits a holdover target but Ellen has a later booking, the system needs flexibility. De Vany’s explanation of the studio-era practice:
- exhibitors often showed pictures from the same distributor, reducing conflicts;
- chains could “move over” a picture to another theater in the circuit;
- the distributor and exhibitor could reschedule within their continuing relationship.

### 7B.vi. Why are clearances good for the viewing public?

Because restricting a film’s simultaneous play in one area:
- keeps films in theaters longer (captures slower-to-learn demand),
- promotes **variety** (more theaters showing different films instead of everyone chasing the same top film),
- supports the sequential release system that yields information and allocates prints efficiently.

---

## Question 8: Formula deals, blanket deals, franchises (why the Court worried; alternative explanations)

### 8A. Why might the Court be troubled?

Because these terms can advantage large circuits and reduce competition:
- big operators get preferential access and flexible allocation;
- rivals may be foreclosed from “cream” locations and releases;
- national aggregation can dull local competitive constraints.

### 8B. Alternative explanations: why give Ellen discretion about where to show films?

Efficiency story:
- Ellen has better local information across her circuit; discretion lets her match films to demand faster.
- reduces contracting costs (no need to renegotiate every theater/film).
- can increase total revenue by optimizing placement and reducing miscoordination.

### 8C. Why base royalty on national ticket sales instead of sales in Ellen’s theaters?

Possible efficiency explanations:
- **risk pooling:** smooths volatility across theaters and aligns incentives at the circuit level.
- **reduces manipulation:** makes it harder to shift revenue across venues to game a single-theater metric.
- **aligns marketing incentives:** if royalties depend on national performance, parties internalize broader effects.

---

## Question 9: Blind selling and block booking

### 9A. Another reason to license a film before it exists?

Yes: **financing and coordination**. Early commitments can:
- reduce distributor/producers’ risk and support production decisions;
- justify marketing investments and release planning;
- signal quality/commitment (though imperfectly).

### 9B. Court concern about block booking (must accept all forty films)?

Anticompetitive story:
- tying: leverage a must-have film to force acceptance of weak films;
- foreclose rivals by filling exhibitors’ slates with your package;
- concentrate power in large distributors/circuits.

### 9C. Why not just charge more for Film A?

Because simple price increases can be constrained:
- exhibitors’ risk constraints and liquidity;
- bargaining frictions and uncertainty (you may not know A’s true value ex ante);
- bundling can extract surplus in a different way when demand is uncertain and when you want commitments across a season.

### 9D. Efficiency explanations for block booking

Plausible non-antitrust rationales:
- **reduces transaction costs** (one negotiation instead of forty);
- **risk pooling** across films in a tournament market;
- **solves coordination** (ensures outlets for the slate; supports planning);
- **reduces oversearching** (too much time/expense spent evaluating each film individually under extreme uncertainty).

---

## Key Takeaways

- The industry problem is not “power vs no power.” It’s that **uncertainty + incomplete contracting** is severe.
- Practices that look anticompetitive often have an efficiency story that maps cleanly onto the course’s triad (uncertainty / information asymmetry / incentives).
- The clean class move: for each practice (VI, minimum price, clearance, block booking), give **both**:
  - the **antitrust theory of harm**, and
  - the **Deals efficiency theory** (what problem it solves; what tradeoff it creates).

---

## Notes for Class Discussion (what to be ready to say fast)

- Define **vertical integration** and give the “complete the contract” story (Hanssen’s 3 roles).
- Use the phrase: **“ex post information arrives during the run; the system is built to adapt.”**
- On clearances: emphasize De Vany’s point that **stable priorities** can coexist with **flexible run lengths** and can increase variety for consumers.
