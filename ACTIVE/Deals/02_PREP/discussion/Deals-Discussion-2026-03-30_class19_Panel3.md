**Problem 19: Motion Pictures: Bargaining Power, Gross-Ups, and Profits
Interests (Panel 3)**

1.  *George Lucas and Bargaining Power.* After the *Paramount* decision
    put an end to "the studio era," contracts allowing talent to
    participate in the studio's profits became more common. Before we
    turn to the standard contracts, let's start with an arrangement that
    was unusual: George Lucas's contract with Twentieth Century Fox to
    make *Star Wars.* (Some answers are not in the reading.)

<!-- -->

a.  Initially, Lucas had a contract to make two movies. What were they?
    How much was he going to get paid for the second movie?

b.  What happened to give him more bargaining power?

c.  What did his agent suggest as a way to use this bargaining power?
    What did he do instead?

d.  Why was the studio willing to accept his suggestion?

e.  How did Lucas's deal compare with the deals struck by other
    successful writers and directors? Was Lucas's main motivation money
    or something else in making this deal?

f.  Was Lucas able to negotiate a similar deal when he and Steven
    Spielberg teamed up to make *Raiders of the Lost Arc*? Why or why
    not?

g.  Years later, Lucas sold his rights to the movies to Disney. How much
    did he get in return?

h.  Based on your answers above, what general lesson about bargaining
    power can we learn from Lucas's negotiation with Fox?

i.  Coda: Media reports suggest that Lucas turned out to be
    disillusioned with the deal--not the money he received, but
    something else (which arguably was even more important to him). Do
    you know what his concern was? (This is not in the reading).

2.  *Batfilm Prod. v. Warner Brothers*

    a.  The more common deal is not the one between Lucas and Twentieth
        Century Fox, but the one litigated in *Batfilm*. What role did
        the plaintiffs play in the movie that is the subject of this
        ligitation?

    b.  What fixed compensation did plaintiffs get?

    c.  What contingent compensation was offered to them? What was the
        dispute about?

    d.  Is the court willing to consider whether the contract is fair?
        Does the court think that this approach is well suited to the
        plaintiffs in this case?

    e.  What doctrine is the court applying? What defense does the court
        offer for the approach it is applying? What does the court say
        is at stake for the motion pictures industry? Do you agree?

    f.  This excerpt of the opinion considers only some of the
        plaintiffs' claims. What is "overhead"? What was the plaintiffs'
        complaint about it? What did the court conclude?

    g.  Assume for the moment that 15% is too high an estimate of "true"
        overhead, which really is more like 5%. Does this matter? If the
        parties understand that 15% overstates the studios costs--and
        thus makes it harder to reach the net profit break-even
        point--then isn't this just the deal the parties agreed to
        strike? Is judicial intervention required here?

    h.  What was the plaintiffs' complaint about videocassette
        royalties? What did the court conclude?

    i.  Given the contract's treatment of videocassette royalties, is
        "net profit" under the contract an accurate measure of a movie's
        profitability? Would accountants produce the same number in the
        profits they report to shareholders?

    j.  In light of your answer to "i," is it possible for a movie to be
        very profitable, but for a writer or director with a "net
        profits" clause to receive no royalty under the clause?

3.  Terminator 3

    a.  Let's compare Arnold Schwarzenneger's contract in Terminator 3
        with the contracts in *Batfilm*? Obviously, Schwarzenneger's
        minimum compensation was a lot higher. How much was it?

    b.  In addition, his contingent contract also was structured
        differently. What was the key difference?

    c.  Why did Schwarzenneger have so much bargaining power in this
        deal?

    d.  What nonfinancial benefits did the contract give Schwarzenneger?
        Did he have any creative control?

    e.  [What percentage of receipts did he get after the movie reached
        the "break even" point?]{.mark}

    f.  [Please answer the following questions, applying the contract's
        definition of "cash breakeven":]{.mark}

> *[Cash Breakeven shall be defined as the point at which there shall
> have been recouped from Adjusted Gross Receipts an amount equaling all
> actual distribution expenses attributable to the Picture (provided
> there shall be no double deductions for any item, including without

> (including without limitation any pre-break participations,
> mutually-approved deferments and completion bond fee), actual interest
> and actual financing costs related to the Picture, a producer fee in

i.  [What expenses are subtracted from adjusted gross receipts to
    calculate cash breakeven for Schwarzenneger?]{.mark}

ii. [In calculating the breakeven point for Schwarzenneger, what
    percentage of receipts from home video royalties are included in
    "adjusted gross receipts"? How does this compare with the analogous
    provision in *Batfilm*?]{.mark}

<!-- -->

g.  [What is the purpose of the following provision in Schwarzenneger's
    contract?:]{.mark}

> *[A. Contractor and Artist have entered into an Actor Loanout
> Agreement dated as of Jun 6, 2001 (the \"Agreement\") pursuant to
> which, inter alia, Artist is rendering acting services in connection
> with the production of that certain feature length motion picture
> tentatively entitled \"Terminator 3\" (the \"Picture\").]{.mark}*
>
> *[B. A portion of the services of Artist to be provided under the
> Agreement may be rendered outside the United States.]{.mark}*
>
> *[C. As a material inducement to Artist to enter into the Agreement,
> and in partial consideration of the performance of services
> thereunder, Contractor has agreed to reimburse Artist on a fully
> \"grossed up\" basis for the payment of any taxes (including, without
> limitation, income tax, social security tax, payroll taxes and other
> social charges, the value added tax and any penalties and interest on
> any of such taxes) to any foreign country or subdivision thereof
> imposed on Artist by reason of Artist\'s rendering of services to

> particularly set forth hereinbelow.]{.mark}*
>
> *[D. The parties\' intention in entering into this Tax Reimbursement
> Agreement is to put Artist in the same economic after-tax position as
> Artist would have been in had all of Actor\'s services under the
> Agreement been performed solely in California through a U.S.
> \"loanout\" corporation, and this Tax Reimbursement Agreement shall be
> interpreted consistent with that intention.]{.mark}*

h.  [Assume that Schwarzenneger becomes subject to a foreign tax of
    \$100,000. To achieve the purpose in "D" above, why is it not enough
    to pay Schwarzenner an additional \$100,000?]{.mark}

i.  [Assume the foreign tax is not deductible and that the combined
    federal and state tax rate is 50%. How much additional compensation
    must Schwarzenneger receive to make him whole for this tax?]{.mark}

j.  [True or False: To make a taxpayer whole for a tax of X, the
    taxpayer must receive a payment of X/(1-T), where T is the
    taxpayer's marginal tax rate.]{.mark}

k.  [Schwarzenneger's "gross up" also included a payment for the
    following: "the amount of any professional fees and costs incurred
    by Artist to obtain foreign tax advice in connection with the
    Picture, if any." If you were his lawyer, and you were trying to
    make the case for this term, what would you say?]{.mark}

l.  [What is the purpose of the following provision? Do you think it was
    included at the request of the studio or of Scharzenneger?:]{.mark}

> *["In computing the Reimbursement Amount, all allowable exemptions,
> credits, deductions and offsets against the Subject Taxes shall be
> taken into account . . . . The Reimbursement Amount shall not include
> any amounts solely and directly resulting from actions or omissions on
> the part of Artist (except to the extent such actions or omissions are
> undertaken (or not undertaken, as the case may be) consistent with the
> Tax Reimbursement Agreement, with the Agreement or with the prior
> written approval of Contractor)."]{.mark}*

4.  Introducing Two Types of Participations: Net & Gross

    a.  Revenue is being divided---but which revenue? To begin answering
        this question consider the following example: Art writes the
        script for *Big Hit*. In return, he got a fee of \$50,000 plus a
        net participation. Assume for all the following questions that
        Art's net participation is fairly standard. Ticket sales in
        theaters for *Big Hit* were \$100 million.

        i.  To compute net participations, the first step is to start
            with "adjusted gross receipts." Whose receipts are we
            talking about? Will this be \$100 million or something else?

        ii. Home video revenue for *Big Hit* was \$50 million. If Art's
            contract is a standard one, will that be included in
            "adjusted gross receipts"?

    b.  Theater versus Home Viewing

        i.  Scarlett is the star of *Black Spider*, which was supposed
            to be released in theaters in May of 2020, but the release
            date was delayed for over a year because of the coronavirus
            pandemic. Eventually, Studio releases Black Spider
            simultaneously in domestic theaters (where it grosses \$80
            million in its first weekend) and also on its "Studio+"
            streaming channel (where it grosses \$60 million in its
            first weekend). Scarlett sues Studio, arguing that her
            contract specified a release exclusively in theaters. Why do
            you think she cares about this? What is at stake for her?

        ii. This is based on a real case, which was settled on very
            favorable terms for one of the parties. Which party do you
            think that was?

    c.  Gross versus Net

        i.  Let's return to *Big Hit*. The star of this movie, Barbara,
            receives a "gross participation." How is this different from
            Art's net participation?

        ii. There are various costs in making *Big Hit*. Which of the
            following is subtracted before Barbara's "gross" is
            computed? What about Art's "net"?

            1.  Studio pays \$X to the director as fixed compensation.

            2.  Studio takes a distribution fee equal to 30% of
                receipts.

            3.  Advertising expenses.

        iii. Barbara, the star of the movie, has a gross participation
             deal. Assume it's a "first dollar" gross deal, and that
             she's supposed to get 10% of the adjusted gross and she
             receives a \$5 million advance. How much must the adjusted
             gross be in order for her to get more than her advance?

    d.  Accuracy

        i.  Can *Big Hit* be very profitable from the perspective of the
            studio's shareholders, but still not generate a "gross"
            profit participation for Barbara?

        ii. True or false: *Big Hit* can be very profitable from the
            perspective of the studio's shareholders, but still not
            generate a "net" profit participation for Art.
