**Class 21: Earnouts as Both a Solution and a Source of**

**Information and Incentive Problems (Panel 2)**

1.  Seller has an established business selling software. The existing
    products generate a robust revenue stream, which the seller values
    at between \$200 M & \$250 M. Buyer is considering making a bid,
    valuing the business as between \$175 M and \$225 M.

> Seller has a new version of its software coming out in six months. A
> key question is how well received it will be in the market. Skeptics
> think it is not as good as the new software soon to be released by a
> competitor, but Seller loyalists expect it is just what Seller needs
> to rejuvenate the brand. The key question is how well the new software
> will sell. Skeptics (including Buyer management) think there is a 20%
> chance that 300 nillion copies will sell in the first year, adding add
> \$100 M of value to the company, while loyalists (including Seller
> management) think there is an 80% chance that 300 million copies will
> sell and the new software will add \$100 M of value.

a.  Without the new software, is there a ZOPA in this transaction?

b.  With the new software, does it seem (at least at first glance) that
    there is a ZOPA for this transaction?

c.  Do you think predictions about the success of the new software pose
    issues of asymmetric information? Or uncertainty? Or both?

d.  What contractual mechanism can potentially help to enable Buyer and
    Seller to find a mutually agreeable price?

e.  What is the difference between an earnout and a contingent value
    right?

f.  Do you think the relevant instrument here should be based on
    appraised value of the company in six months? Or on something else?
    Why?

2.  Ann is an up-and-coming tennis player. Nickel, a popular sports
    apparel company, is discussing an endorsement deal with her. Ann has
    charisma and an exciting playing style, as well as the potential to
    be a top 10 player or perhaps even a top 3 player. But she has a
    tendence to choke in big matches, and she also injured her knee last
    year. She is likely to recover fully, but there's uncertainty about
    this. Bob, who is negotiating for Nickel, is trying to figure out
    what to offer Ann. A \$100X annual payment is appropriate for a
    top-20 player (which is what she is now), but a \$300X annual
    payment is appropriate for a top-10 player (which is what she could
    be). Nickel is also considering creating a special line of tennis
    sneakers named for Ann, which she would wear.

> Obviously, Nickel is not the only game in town. Adonis is also
> speaking with Ann, Obviously, Nickel has many other prospects as well.

a.  Why is the fixed payment hard to determine?

b.  What alternatives can Bob consider in structuring a package for Ann?
    Please offer some detail about the contract you have in mind.

3.  Christine, a scientist, is the CEO of a pharmaceutical startup
    called C-Pharma. She is hard at work on a new pain killer, Nopain,
    which would be effective and not addictive. She intends for this
    drug to be for patients who have had surgery or sustained serious
    injuries, and thus need pain relief for between 2 and 6 weeks.
    C-Pharma has no other drugs in development.

> Dalia, who is the head of acquisitions for for Big-Pharma, is
> considering making a bid for C-Pharma. She recognizes that if Nopain
> actually works, it will be extremely marketable. Dalia predicts that
> the revenue stream's discounted value will be worth \$300 M or more.
>
> But Dalia is struggling to figure out the likelihood that Nopain
> actually will succeed. There are several steps in the process. Will it
> actually be effective in treating pain? Will there be harmful or
> unpleasant side effects? Will it be finished before competitor drugs
> come to market? Will it get the necessary regulatory approvals?

a.  Why might Christine and Dalia make different predictions about these
    questions? If they do, what effect do their differences have on the
    ability to price the deal?

b.  What alternative can you suggest for Dalia to propose? Why does it
    help bridge the differences between Christine and Dalia?

c.  Should your proposal in part "b" be based on several milestones or
    just one or two? Which ones would you pick and why?

d.  What signal do Christine and Dalia send in crafting a term like the
    one in "b"? Why might that be helpful?

e.  Is the term in "b" more or less helpful if Christine would stay on
    to run C-Pharma as a subsidiary of Big-Pharma?

4.  Whale-co, which makes widgets, is considering an acquisition of
    Minnow-co, which makes a specialized type of widget, which Whale-co
    management thinks could become a new source of revenue for Whale-co.
    Yet Whale-co is thinking of Minnow-co as just one possible new
    direction. It is acquiring 7 other companies that have similar
    prospects. There is significant uncertainty about which, if any, of
    these 8 companies will succeed. Meanwhile, Whale-co earns \$1
    billion per year, while Minnow-co earns \$30 million per year.

    a.  If Whale-co wants to incorporate an earnout in the offer, would
        a revenue based earnout make sense? Or a profit-based earnout?
        What are the advantages and disadvantages of these two
        approaches?

    b.  Why might the Minnow-co management worry about depending too
        heavily on an earnout in this situation? How might Whale-co have
        a conflict of interest?

    c.  Why is it challenging to pick a length of time for the earnout
        period? What are the risks if it is short? If it is long?

    d.  Whale-co is buying a number of different companies. Why might
        this be a red flag to Minnow-co, as its management considers
        whether to agree to an earnout?

    e.  To what extent can the problems in "d" be addressed by a
        reasonableness term in the contract? Or by specifying who makes
        management decisions?

    f.  What other ideas do K & S mention and what problems do they
        identify with them?

5.  Did K & S recommend the use of earnouts or not? What position do you
    think they were taking? Did you agree with it?

6.  In what situations will earnouts be most effective? When will they
    be least effective? Why?
