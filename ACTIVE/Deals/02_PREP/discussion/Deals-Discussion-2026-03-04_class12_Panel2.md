**Discussion Questions #12: Disclosure as a Response to**

**Information and Incentive Problems (Panel 2)**

1.  Easterbrook & Fishel ("E&F") say that fraud is inefficient. What
    reasons do they give?

2.  A central theme of this class is that information asymmetry can
    undermine mutually beneficial transactions. In principle, a solution
    to this problem is disclosure. But a key question is whether this
    disclosure be trusted. Let's begin by assuming (incorrectly) that
    there is no ban on fraud, so we can explore whether disclosure would
    have any value.

    a.  Assume there are two firms: Competentco (CC) and Ineptco (IC).
        Does CC have the incentive to disclose information about itself?
        In doing so, does it have an incentive to do so in a way that is
        trustworthy?

    b.  Does IC also have an incentive to disclose accurate information
        about itself?

    c.  How do E&F say that a high quality firm like CC can reassure
        potential investors that its information is accurate?

    d.  Given your answers to "a," "b" and "c," might investors who are
        thinking of investing in either CC or IC have ways to tell which
        is higher quality, even if no disclosure is required and even if
        fraud is not illegal?

    e.  Easterbrook & Fishel concede that a firm's have only a limited
        ability to convince investors that their information is
        accurate. Why? (Hint: can a firm disclose everything? Do
        investors want to verify everything?)

    f.  Review: What role can investment bankers and accountants plan in
        this process?

    g.  Review: What role does incentive compensation play? Can
        nonprofits use this strategy?

3.  E&F say that a ban on fraud (without a requirement to disclose) can
    help reduce information asymmetry.

    a.  In their view, without a ban on fraud, is information totally
        unreliable?

    b.  How does a ban on fraud help firms bridge information asymmetry?

    c.  E&F say that a ban on fraud reduces the cost of signaling
        quality, but not to zero. Why doesn't the rule eliminate these
        costs?

    d.  E&F observe that a ban on fraud introduces costs of its own.
        What are these costs?

4.  E&F analyze what (if anything) a rule requiring disclosure adds to
    an anti-fraud rule.

    a.  Can a firm remain silent under both types of rules?

    b.  Is information a public good? If so, does this tell us anything
        about whether the right amount of information is produced?

    c.  According to E&F, why might too little information be produced?
        Why might too much be produced?

    d.  Without a rule requiring disclosure, would a firm have the
        incentive to disclose good news?

    e.  Without a rule requiring disclosure, why might a firm hesitate
        to disclose bad news?

    f.  According to E&F, if a firm always discloses good news, and
        decides to remain silent, how will investors interpret this
        silence?

    g.  According to E&F, given your answer to "f," does a firm have a
        reason to disclose bad news?

5.  Later in their article, E&F say the following: "Imposition of a
    standard format and time of disclosure facilitates comparative use
    of what is disclosed and helps to create an efficient disclosure
    language. If every firm must disclose the same things, there will be
    reciprocal benefits to each firm\'s investors even though the firm
    will be compelled to disclose things of advantage to rivals."

    a.  What is a "network effect"? (This is not in the reading.)

    b.  Are network effects when firms use the same format and
        definitions when disclosing information? Do these network
        effects offer a potential justification for mandatory
        disclosure?

    c.  What potential problem might there be with government
        requirements about the format and definitions in disclosure?

6.  Adrian is the CEO of a nonprofit. Bob is her Chief Planning Officer,
    and Charlotte is the Chief Financial Officer. Bob and Charlotte
    would each like Adrian's job. Adrian and Bob plan a new initiative,
    which does not go well. Diane is the donor who funded it. Adrian and
    Bob are deciding what to tell Diane about the unsuccessful
    experiment.

    a.  Could Adrian and Bob incur legal liability by saying, "The
        experiment was bold and really illuminating, and we couldn't
        have done it without you"?

    b.  What if instead Adrian and Bob say, "The experiment showed us
        how to deliver service just as effectively for only ½ the cost"
        when this is not accurate?

    c.  Why might Adrian and Bob feel strongly that they need to tell
        the truth? Please offer reasons rooted in principle, as well as
        reasons rooted in self-interest.

    d.  Why might Adrian and Bob be tempted to shade the truth, giving a
        more optimistic picture than is warranted?

    e.  If Adrian and Bob do provide false or misleading information,
        please offer two reasons why Charlotte might tell Diane that she
        is being misled.

    f.  Even when nonprofit professionals and boards are tempted to
        offer misleading information, do they still have reasons not to
        do so?

    g.  Assume that Adrian and Bob want the information they share to be
        more credible. They approach Ellen, a professor at the local
        university, asking her to provide an analysis, which they will
        disclose on their website. Why might this sort of expert opinion
        add value? Why might it not?

7.  Your college roommate, Frank, is the CEO of an opera company. She
    has just launched two new productions, *A* and *B*. *A* has
    attracted a large audience (all productions sold out) visitors while
    *B* has attracted a disappointing audience (one-half of tickets
    unsold). Frank is thinking of posting the ticket sales on the
    nonprofit's website, issuing press releases, and reporting these
    numbers to his board. Before deciding whether to do so, he calls you
    to ask for advice.

    a.  Do you think Frank should release the ticket sales for *A*? Will
        Frank be more or less enthusiastic about releasing the ticket
        sales for *B*?

    b.  What problem do you see if he chooses to report the numbers for
        **A**, but not *B*?

    c.  In light of your answer to "b," what is the case for *never*
        releasing these numbers for any production? What is the case for
        *always* releasing these numbers for any production?

8.  Jane is president of a university, which has a broad curriculum.
    Janet considers climate change a major challenge, so she has cut
    funding for other departments, including the classics department, in
    order to launch a climate school. Jane is thinking of posting a
    document on the university's website explaining the new strategy.

    a.  Kim is a successful entrepreneur who has supported the
        university generously. She was a classics major, and believes
        that her engagement with the classics had a major influence on
        her life and career. What are the advantages and disadvantages
        of highlighting the new strategy in writing, so Kim will know
        the details?

    b.  Jane is eager to motivate her team to do their best work. What
        are the advantages and disadvantages of describing the results
        from the first year in writing (e.g., number of students
        enrolled in the climate school, cuts in enrollment in classics
        and other programs) and posting this report online?

    c.  Len is the university's most generous donor. He supports the
        pivot to climate, and he wants to know the results. Do you think
        he can get them, even if Jane doesn't share them publicly?

    d.  Mary donates \$500 per year to the university. She also supports
        the pivot to climate and wants to know the details. Do you think
        she can get them, even if Jane doesn't share them publicly?

    e.  Nan runs a rating agency that evaluates universities. She has
        heard about the pivot to climate and wants to know how this
        initiative is doing. Do you think she can get them, even if Jane
        doesn't share them publicly?

    f.  Why might it be a good idea (or a bad idea) for Janet to post
        the report she sends to Len online, making it available to
        anyone who is interested to learn more about the university's
        work?

9.  Form 990

    a.  Does Form 990 require nonprofits to share information about the
        compensation of senior professionals and the board? About key
        governance issues, including whether they have conflict of
        interest policies?

    b.  Does Form 990 require nonprofits to provide a financial
        statement, which reports different types of income and expenses?

    c.  Does Form 990 require nonprofits to share information about the
        impact and cost-effectiveness of their programs?

10. Overhead ratios

    a.  What are overhead ratios?

    b.  Why do rating agencies use them to evaluate the quality of
        nonprofits?

    c.  What is the argument for relying on them?

    d.  What is the argument against relying on them?

11. Penelope is the head of a humanitarian organization, which provides
    job training to single mothers. To track her organization's
    progress, Penelope measures the income of clients before they enroll
    in the program and compares it with their income six months after
    they finish the program. Quincy is the head of Foundation, who is
    considering a grant to Penelope's organization.

    a.  Quincy sends Penelope a draft gift agreement. It would require
        Penelope to do a survey asking people enrolled in training
        programs to describe how satisfied they are with the program,
        answering various questions about the quality of the teaching,
        materials, space, and the like on a scale of 1 to 10. Penelope
        has not been asking these questions. She calls you and asks
        whether she should agree to these terms. What do you tell her?.

    b.  You are on the board of Quincy's foundation. Assume that you
        know about the questions he has asked Penelope to answer, and
        that Penelope has asked not to answer them, proposing the
        alternative described above instead (comparing incomes). Quincy
        tells you that he still wants Penelope to answer his questions.
        "We ask all of our grantees to do this survey, and we then
        compare the scores." Do you agree or disagree with Quincy on
        this?
