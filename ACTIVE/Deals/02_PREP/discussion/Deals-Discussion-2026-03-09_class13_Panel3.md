**Derivatives: Basic Building Blocks**

> I. ***Forward Contracts and Swaps***

1\. What is a derivative?

2\. What is the difference between a "long" and "short" position?

3\. What is a forward?

4\. Suppose the price of gold is \$1,800 per ounce on June 1, 2022, and
Debbie enters into the following contract. She agrees that in two years
(*i.e.*, June 1, 2024), she will buy one ounce of gold from Larry. When
she receives the gold in June of 2024, she will pay \$1,900.

A. Who is "long" under this contract? Who is "short"?

> B. If the price of gold in June of 2024 is \$2,100 per ounce, what are
> Debbie's economic consequences from entering into this contract? What
> are Larry's consequences? (For simplicity's sake, assume Larry did not
> own the gold upon entering into this contract; instead, he buys it in
> June of 2023, in order to deliver it to Debbie.)
>
> C. What if instead the price of gold in June 2024 is \$1,500?
>
> D. What would it mean for the parties to "cash settle" this contract?
> How is that different from "physical settlement"?

5\. On the forward contract in the prior question, please note that
Debbie does not have to pay the purchase price for two years.

A.  Why do you think the price is \$1,900, even though the current
    market price is \$1,800? Is the "forward" price higher than the
    "spot" price (the current market price) because the parties predict
    that the price will rise?

B.  What is "leverage"?

C.  Which is a more "leveraged" investment -- buying the stock today, or
    entering into a forward contract to buy it at a fixed price in the
    future?

6\. Other derivatives share the same economic properties as a forward
contract.

A.  What is a futures contract?

B.  What is a swap? Are they "cash settled" or "physically settled"? Are
    they settled all at once or periodically?

C.  Suppose Debbie and Larry want to change the above arrangement in two
    respects. First, Larry will not make physical delivery of the gold.
    Second, Debbie and Larry will not wait the whole two years (*i.e.*,
    until June of 2024) to settle up their bet on the price of gold.
    Instead, they want to make two one-year bets. Suggest a derivative
    they can use to achieve this goal. What kind of derivative is this?

> II\. ***Options***

7\. When an ounce of Gold is trading at \$1,800 per ounce, Debbie pays
Larry \$40 for an option to buy gold from him at \$1,850 at any time in
the next year.

> A. What is Debbie's option called? Is Debbie's option American or
> European style?
>
> B. What is Larry's position called? What is the term for the payment
> he receives?
>
> C. What is the economic result for Debbie and Larry if Gold is trading
> at \$1,950 in one year?
>
> D. What is the economic result for Debbie and Larry if Gold is trading
> at \$1,750 in one year?
>
> E. How would your answer change if, instead of buying an option,
> Debbie had entered into a forward contract to buy an ounce of gold
> from Larry at \$1,850 in one year? (Review: Why would the forward
> price be \$1,850, even though the current price is \$1,800?)

8\. Assume that Larry believes the price of gold is going to decline
below its current \$1,800 level. What option should he buy from Debbie
(assuming she is willing to sell it)?

9\. Assume that Debbie wants to enter into a forward contract to buy 1
ounce of Gold from Larry for \$1,850 in one year. Instead of using a
forward contract, can she achieve the same economic result with one or
more option transactions? In other words, how can you synthesize a
forward contract with options?

10\. Rank from most leveraged to least leveraged: a) a direct investment
in gold; b) a forward contract to buy gold; and c) a call option to buy
gold.

11\. Assume that Debbie believes the price of gold will rise from
\$1,800 to \$2,000 -- but will go no higher. She wants to make a profit
on this prediction, but she wants to minimize her risk of being wrong,
and she wants to pay as little money as possible to place this bet. How
can she do it? (Hint \-- she buys one option and sells another.)

12\. When the price of gold is \$1,800, Larry will charge Debbie \$40
for an option to buy gold at \$1,850 at any time in the next year. Will
he increase or decrease the price, if the option changes as follows?
Why?

> A. Debbie is allowed to use the option at any time in the next three
> years.
>
> B. The price of gold falls to \$1,799. Will the price of the option
> change by more or less than a dollar? Alternatively, what if the price
> rises to \$1,801?

13\. Debbie and Mimi have different predictions about the price of gold
in one year. Debbie believes there is a 50% chance that Gold will trade
at \$1,900, and a 50% chance that it will trade at \$1,700. In contrast,
Mimi believes there is a 50% chance that Gold will trade at \$2,300 and
a 50% chance that gold will trade at \$1,300.

A.  Who will be willing to pay more for gold today -- or would they both
    pay the same price?

B.  Who would be willing to pay more for a call option to buy gold at
    \$1,800 -- or would they both pay the same price?
