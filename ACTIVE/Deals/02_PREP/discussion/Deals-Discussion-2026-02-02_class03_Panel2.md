1.  Bob Buyer wants to buy a weekend house. You are Bob's lawyer. He
    sees a property that he really likes in Pretty County, which is 50
    miles away from his year-round home. Susan Seller's asking price is
    \$1.1 million. Bob offers \$950,000 and they settle on a price of
    \$1,030,000. Susan is represented by Linda Lawyer.

> Before signing a contract, Bob needs your help with due diligence on
> the house, which was built in 1957. An important issue is that most
> houses built then were heated by oil and had oil tanks buried
> underground. In newer houses, oil tanks are no longer buried
> underground because of concerns about contaminating soil and
> groundwater. Buyers looking at older houses sometimes hire experts,
> who use metal detectors to look for underground tanks. This inspection
> costs approximately \$1,000. If a tank is found, the market practice
> is for sellers to bear the expense of removing it, which costs about
> \$5,000, but can be significantly more if the tank has leaked and the
> soil needs to be remediated.
>
> In the property disclosure form, which sellers provide to anyone
> looking at a house, Susan answered "no" to the question, "Is there an
> underground oil tank?"
>
> Before signing a contract to buy the house, Bob hires Ira Inspector to
> look for potential defects in it. In his inspection report, Ira
> observes that the oil tank currently is in the garage. But he sees
> pipes going from the garage into the ground, which is a sign that
> there could be an old oil tank there. "I'm pretty sure there was an
> underground tank," Ira tells Bob. "Otherwise, what are those pipes
> for?"
>
> Bob relays this question to Susan, who answers: "There aren't any
> pipes." When Bob sends a picture, Susan answers: "I don't know, but
> maybe those pipes lead to a propane tank. We use propane to heat the
> pool." Ira says that this doesn't make sense, since the pool is quite
> a distance from the garage.
>
> Susan follows up with another email: "[Spoke to the oil company that
> has supplied oil to the house since I bought it. They re-used the tank
> that was there and relocated to existing location. Neither I nor they
> have any knowledge of an underground tank. Further, during
> construction, we excavated around the entire house and none was
> found."]{.mark}
>
> Bob wonders where the tank was before it was moved. Was it
> underground, so that it might have left contaminants in the soil?
> Through his broker, Bob asks Susan whether the tank that was relocated
> used to be underground. Susan replies: "[When we bought the house in
> 1992, the oil tank was in the original garage and was above ground.
> When we expanded the house, we knocked down the garage and built the
> new one and relocated the tank to where it is today."]{.mark}
>
> [Bob asks Susan whether she would put a representation in the
> contract, saying that there is no oil tank and if one is later found,
> she will pay to clean up any environmental damage. Susan says that all
> she would say in the contract is, "To the best of my knowledge, there
> is no underground tank," and that this representation would "not
> survive the closing." This means that if one is found after closing,
> she is not responsible for any harm it might have caused.]{.mark}

a.  Based on these responses, do you think Bob should conduct a scan for
    an old underground oil tank?

b.  Do you think it is reasonable for Bob to ask Susan to bear some of
    the cost of the scan? As Bob's lawyer, please offer arguments
    explaining why Susan should share in the cost.

c.  Assume that Bob does a scan and finds an oil tank, and Susan agrees
    to remove it. How might this interaction affect Bob's dealings with
    Susan on other issues?

<!-- -->

2.  The same facts as in problem 1. While inspecting the property, Ira
    notices another issue: the current oil tank (which, as noted above,
    is in the garage) is not installed properly. Exhaust fumes are not
    vented out of the garage. Since the garage is attached to the house,
    Ira says there is a risk that exhaust fumes will vent into the
    house, something he says is unhealthy and potentially dangerous.

    a.  What should Bob's position be about the venting issue with the
        current oil tank?

    b.  Assume that Bob does not like the color and appearance of the
        oil tank. Is it likely that Susan will bear the expense of
        replacing it? Is the analysis the same as the request in "a"
        about venting the tank?

3.  The same facts as in problem 1. Ira also finds mold growing in the
    crawl space under the house. This means there are likely to be mold
    spores in the air inside the house, something that is not healthy
    for anyone but is especially an issue for Bob and his family, who
    have allergies and various respiratory problems.

> Ira outlines two steps to eliminate the mold. First, the area must be
> cleaned thoroughly by professionals who specialize in remediating
> mold. This step costs approximately \$5,000. Second, to prevent growth
> of mold in the future, a pump must be installed to remove water from
> below the house and a dehumidifier must be installed to remove
> moisture in the air. This step costs \$2,000.
>
> In response, Susan says, "That's not mold. It's just a discoloration,
> which has been there since we bought the house thirty years ago. If it
> bothers you, I will ask my housekeeper to scrub it thoroughly with
> bleach and paint over it."

a.  If Bob walks away from this deal, will other buyers care as much
    about the mold as Bob?

b.  If Bob walks away, is another buyer likely to detect the mold?

c.  Assuming that Susan does the same analysis of "a" and "b," what do
    you expect her position to be? Will she be willing to address this
    issue?

d.  If Susan agrees to address the issue, why might Bob worry that she
    won't address it as carefully as he would? If he has this concern,
    what alternative can he suggest to resolve the issue? (Hint: With
    this alternative, he would be the one deciding the specifics of what
    to do.)

<!-- -->

4.  The same facts as in problem 2. The house has a pool\--a nice
    feature for a weekend house. Bob wants the pool to be attractive.
    Resurfacing the pool costs approximately \$10,000.

> Bob also wants to be sure that the pool's systems are in working
> order. For example, the heater should work, the drainage pipes should
> not be clogged or leak, and the motorized filter, which cleans the
> pool, should also work. Repairing all of these systems would cost
> approximately \$15,000.
>
> In addition, the pool needs all the necessary safety features. For
> example, the pool needs to have a fence, so no one accidentally falls
> in and so no uninvited guests use the pool and are injured. Indeed, to
> get home owners insurance, Bob needs to show the insurance company
> that there is a fence. It costs \$2,000 to install a fence.
>
> The pool also should have two drains, instead of one, in order to
> reduce the suction from each drain. Otherwise, the suction might be
> strong enough to pull swimmers down to the drain, causing them to
> drown. Installing a second drain costs \$8,000.
>
> Bob is doing his due diligence in late January. The pool has been
> covered for the winter, and there is snow on the ground, so Bob is
> limited in the due diligence he can do. For example, although he can
> have the cover removed, the pool systems are not designed to work in
> freezing temperatures. Turning the systems on when the temperature is
> less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit\--as almost certainly will be the case
> in late January\--can cause the systems to break. Bob is willing to
> delay the closing until the weather is warmer, but Susan wants the
> closing to take place no later than March 1.

a.  Which issues can Bob explore before March 1? Which ones cannot be
    investigated before March 1?

b.  If Susan insists on closing before March 1, what should Bob suggest
    as a way to address his concerns about the pool and, specifically,
    about issues that cannot be investigated before March 1?

c.  Susan is willing to assure Bob that the pool systems work and are
    safe. "But if you want the pool to look different, that's your
    responsibility," she says. "You can make any changes you want to the
    appearance of the pool once you buy the house, but that expense is
    your responsibility." Does this distinction seem reasonable? If so,
    how can Bob and Susan operationalize it?

d.  If Susan and Bob proceed with the idea in "c," can you prediction
    any scenarios in which they disagree about whether an expense is
    addressing safety or aesthetic issues? What language would you
    suggest to deal with this?

<!-- -->

5.  Same facts as above. In asking \$1.1 million for the house, Susan
    has offered to include outdoor furniture, art, exercise equipment,
    beds, a dining room table, and other personal property. This
    personal property was worth approximately \$50,000. Since this is a
    second home for Bob, he liked the idea of buying this personal
    property as well. When they settled on a price of \$1,030,000 (as
    noted above), this included the personal property.

> Before signing a contract, Bob reaches out to you. As a real estate
> lawyer, you know that New York (where Pretty County is located) has a
> "mansion" tax. Under this tax, a buyer pays 1% of the value of any
> home with a purchase price of \$1 million or more. This tax does not
> apply to a home with a purchase price of less than \$1 million.
>
> New York also charges an 8 percent sales tax on sales of personal
> property. While this obviously applies to purchases in a store, it
> also applies at garage sales and in other circumstances when one
> individual buys personal property from another, as long as the total
> price of all the property is more than a minimum amount (which you
> should assume here is \$500).
>
> The town where the house is located also has an annual property tax of
> 3% of a house's appraised value. The town's last appraisal three years
> ago valued Susan's house at \$800,000, so she has been paying property
> taxes of \$24,000 per year. The town is likely to use Bob's purchase
> price as the valuation for his property taxes.

a.  Susan's lawyer sends over a contract, which includes the following
    language: "The parties hereto acknowledge that there is no
    consideration attributable to the personal property included
    hereunder." In light of this language, what taxes will Bob owe?
    Which will he avoid?

b.  What suggestion can you make that will reduce Bob's tax bill in the
    coming years? Please note that Bob will still have to pay Susan a
    total of \$1.03 million\--that's not negotiable\--and that Bob is
    very conservative about tax planning. He will only do something that
    is clearly legal.

c.  Before the closing, there is some damage to the house in a storm.
    Susan knows that the damage is her responsibility but she has moved
    away and is not in a position to supervise the repairs herself. She
    also realizes that Bob will want the opportunity to "do it his way."
    She offers to give Bob a \$2,000 credit. "The purchase price will be
    the same," she says, "but we'll treat the amount you will pay your
    contractors as part of the purchase price." Bob mentions this to you
    and you say, "we should do it differently as a way to reduce your
    taxes." What is the better alternative?

<!-- -->

6.  The same facts as in above. Susan's lawyer sends over the attached
    draft, which (among other things) is supposed to address the
    following issues. How does the draft treat these issues. What
    changes (if any) would you suggest for each?

    a.  Ira's inspection yields a list of minor repairs that are needed
        for the house to be in working order. Susan commits to do them
        before the closing, and Bob wants her to use a licensed
        contractor for these repairs (i.e., and not to do them herself
        or to ask someone who is not an expert to do them). Bob wonders
        how he can confirm that all the work was done, especially since
        some of it involves electrical work inside the walls of the
        house. What does the draft provide? What change, if any, would
        you suggest? (Hint: Focus on two clauses in the rider.)

    b.  Susan built a guest apartment over the garage and applied for a
        permit from the town, which would allow her (and any subsequent
        owner) to rent out the apartment to tenants. Bob wants to make
        sure that the town has, in fact, issued a permit (or a so-called
        "certificate of occupancy") for the apartment. What does the
        draft provide? What change, if any, would you suggest? (Hint:
        Focus on the rider.)

    c.  Bob is borrowing money to buy the house. He wants to be excused
        from the contract if after reasonable efforts he is unable to
        secure a mortgage. What does the draft provide? What change, if
        any, would you suggest? (Hint: Focus on the main contract.)

    d.  Bob's lawyer does a "title search," in which a company searches
        public records to confirm that Susan actually is the owner of
        the property and that the town's building department has not
        found any building code violations. The search reveals that
        Susan does not have a permit for the shed next to the house. In
        light of the above violation, Bob still wants to buy the house,
        but he wants Susan to get this permit before closing. What
        remedy does the draft provide? What change, if any, would you
        suggest? (Hint: Focus on the main contract's Sections 6 and
        10a.)

    e.  Bob wants to do a "walk through" the day before the closing to
        make sure all the work that Susan promised to do has, in fact,
        been done and that there are no new problems with the house. If
        he finds any issues, he wants to delay the closing until Susan
        has addressed them. What does the draft provide? What change, if
        any, would you suggest? (Hint: Focus on the main contract's
        Sections 7 and 15).

Included in this sale, for the aforesaid purchase price, are all
fixtures, as well as the personal property listed in Appendix A.

5\. **MORTGAGE CONTINGENCY**. Intentionally Deleted

> 6\. **TITLE CONTINGENCY**

a\. BUYER\'s obligations are contingent upon a BUYER obtaining
"reasonably satisfactory title" and "reasonably satisfactory municipal
searches" to be completed within three weeks of the signing of this
agreement. In the event one or both such searches are not reasonably
satisfactory to the BUYER, BUYER shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement by giving written notice as provided in Paragraph 32 of such
termination on or prior to the Title and Municipal Date. Upon receipt of
such notice, SELLER shall return all Deposit monies as soon as
practicable as paid hereunder except for the sum of Four Hundred Fifty
(\$450.00) Dollars towards the cost of preparation of this Agreement
and, upon delivery of such funds, this Agreement shall terminate.

b\. For the purposes of this Paragraph 6, "reasonably satisfactory
title" shall mean: title which does not contain any restrictions on the
use of the property which would significantly impair BUYER\'s stated
intended use and enjoyment of the Property. Utility easements, so long
as the same are limited to bringing service to the Property, shall not
be deemed to impair the use and enjoyment of the Property.

c\. For the purposes of this Paragraph 6, a "reasonably satisfactory
municipal search", if any, shall mean a search showing matters of public
record which: (i) materially conform to the listing provided to BUYER by
SELLER\'s agent, (ii) conform to such facts that a physical inspection
of the property shall reveal, and (iii) do not reveal any open permits
requiring final municipal approval.

> 7\. **CONDITION OF PREMISES *\[THIS AGREEMENT IS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY
> INSPECTION CONTINGENCIES\]***. The BUYER agrees that he has inspected
> said Premises, is satisfied with the physical condition thereof and
> agrees to accept at closing the Premises in the condition that the
> Premises were disclosed to be or were in as of the date of BUYER\'s
> initial home inspection in an \"as is\" and \"where is\" condition,
> reasonable wear and tear excepted.
>
> 8\. **DEED**. The SELLER, on receiving the total purchase price,
> shall, at the SELLER\'s cost and expense, execute, acknowledge, and
> deliver to the BUYER, or BUYER\'s permitted assigns, the usual full
> covenant Warranty Deed (or appropriate Fiduciary\'s Deed) in proper
> form, to convey to the BUYER, or BUYER\'s permitted assigns, the fee
> simple of the Premises, free of all encumbrances except as hereinafter
> provided. The SELLER shall thereupon pay all real estate conveyance
> taxes and shall complete and deliver to the BUYER the conveyance tax
> forms.
>
> 9\. **CLOSING**. The deed shall be delivered at the offices of
> seller's attorney on the **1st** day of **March**, **2021** at
> **10:00am** (the \"Closing Date\").
>
> 10\. **TITLE**.

a\. If, upon the date for the delivery of the deed, the SELLER shall be
unable to deliver or cause to be delivered a deed or deeds conveying
marketable title to the Premises, then the SELLER shall be allowed a
reasonable postponement of closing, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar
days, within which to perfect title. If at the end of said time the
SELLER is still unable to deliver or cause to be delivered a deed or
deeds conveying a marketable title to said Premises, subject as
aforesaid, the BUYER (i) may elect to accept such title as the SELLER
can convey, without modification of the purchase price, or (ii) may
reject such title. Upon such rejection, all sums paid on account hereof,
together with any nonrefundable expenses actually incurred by the BUYER
shall be paid to the BUYER without interest thereon. Upon receipt of
such payment, this Agreement shall terminate and the parties hereto
shall be released and discharged from all further claims and obligations
hereunder. SELLER shall be entitled to require BUYER to provide
reasonable proof of payment of said expenses.

b\. The SELLER represents that the Premises and the present use thereof
are not in violation of any governmental rules, codes, permits,
regulations or limitations, unless same have become legally
nonconforming, and there are no violations of any enforceable
restrictive covenant, agreement or condition subject to which title to
the Premises is to be conveyed in accordance with the terms hereof.

d\. The Premises will be conveyed to and accepted by the BUYER subject
to:

> i\. Any and all zoning and/or building restrictions, limitations,
> regulations, ordinances, and/or laws.
>
> ii\. Real Property Taxes on the Current Grand List and any and all
> existing tax payments, municipal liens and assessments, coming due on
> or after the Closing Date; the BUYER shall by acceptance of the deed
> assume and agree to pay, any and all such tax payments, liens and
> assessments which may on or after the date hereof be assessed, levied
> against or become a lien on the Premises.
>
> 11.. **APPORTIONMENT**. Real estate taxes and municipal or town
> assessment, if any, shall be apportioned over the fiscal period for
> which levied. All adjustments shall be apportioned based upon a 365
> day year and the actual number of days in the month in which the
> closing occurs.
>
> 12\. **RISK OF LOSS**. The risk of loss or damage by fire or other
> casualty to the buildings on the Premises until the time of the
> delivery of the deed is assumed by the SELLER. Throughout the period
> between the date of this Agreement and the delivery of the deed,
> SELLER shall continue to carry his existing fire and extended coverage
> insurance on the buildings on the Premises. In the event that such
> loss or damage does occur prior to the delivery of the deed, the
> SELLER shall be allowed a reasonable time thereafter, not to exceed
> thirty (30) calendar days from such loss or damage, within which to
> repair or replace such loss or damage to BUYER\'s reasonable
> satisfaction.
>
> 13\. **MAINTENANCE**. The house, grounds and facilities shall be
> maintained by the SELLER between the date of BUYER\'s signing hereof
> and the closing of title.
>
> 14\. **DELIVERY OF PREMISES**. The SELLER agrees to deliver,
> simultaneously with the closing of title, exclusive possession of the
> Premises, broom-clean, free of all debris, litter and furnishings and
> shall deliver all keys in SELLER\'s possession to the BUYER.
>
> 15\. **LIABILITY FOR DELAYED CLOSING**. In the event of a delay in
> closing as set forth herein, other than as provided for under the
> provisions of this Agreement, through no fault of the SELLER, beyond
> **ten (10)** business days, then the BUYER will reimburse the SELLER,
> from the **eleventh (11^th^)** business day to the actual date of
> closing, for the SELLER\'s carrying costs of said property, including
> taxes, mortgage interest, utilities and per diem interest on SELLER\'s
> equity in the Premises, which amount shall be calculated at the rate
> of 1/30th of 1% of the purchase price for each day of delay from the
> **eleventh (11^th^)** business day up to the actual date of closing.
> Further, in the event of a delay in closing of more than **ten (10)**
> business days, through no fault of the BUYER, SELLER shall reimburse
> BUYER for carrying costs for temporary housing, temporary storage of
> personal property, living expenses and other miscellaneous expenses at
> the same per diem rate of 1/30th of 1% of the purchase price for each
> day of delay from the **eleventh (11^th^)**) business day up to the
> actual date of closing. \[For example, the per diem cost of a
> \$450,000 transaction would be \$150 per day.\]
>
> 16\. **DEFAULT**. If BUYER is in material default hereunder, and
> provided SELLER stands ready to perform SELLER\'s obligations,
> SELLER\'s sole and exclusive remedy shall be the right to terminate
> this Agreement by written notice to BUYER or BUYER\'s attorney, and
> the Escrow Agent and SELLER shall retain the Deposit as reasonable
> liquidated damages for BUYER\'s inability or unwillingness to perform.
> In the event such written notice of termination of this Agreement is
> given by SELLER, the Premises shall be free of any claims or interest
> of the BUYER therein by virtue of this Agreement, provided neither
> party objects to same within 5 business days of receipt of notice of
> termination.
>
> If SELLER is in material default hereunder, BUYER shall have such
> remedies as BUYER shall be entitled to at law or in equity, including,
> but not limited to, specific performance.
>
> 17\. **DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS**. The SELLER shall deliver to the BUYER
> prior to closing any documents, informational materials, building
> plans and any surveys in the SELLER\'s possession pertaining to the
> Premises, the appliances and the systems on or within the Premises.
>
> 18\. The delivery and acceptance of the deed herein described shall be
> deemed to constitute full compliance with all the terms, conditions,
> covenants and representations contained herein, or made in connection
> with this transaction, except as may herein be expressly provided and
> except for the warranties of title.
>
> 19\. **REPRESENTATIONS**. Unless otherwise specified herein, none of
> the representations made in this Agreement including all attachments
> shall survive delivery of the deed, and all representations by SELLER
> are made to the best of SELLER\'s knowledge and belief and without
> duty of inquiry. SELLER shall have an affirmative obligation to notify

> Attachments are no longer true. Except in the event of an intentional
> misrepresentation, if BUYER discovers prior to the closing of title
> any material representation contained in this Agreement including all

> shown on the Pretty County Bar Association website (the \"Standard
> Form\") and agree all deviations and changes made by either the
> SELLER\'s or BUYER\'s attorney must be clearly marked in bold,
> underline and/or large font typeface, handwritten or otherwise
> highlighted to indicate the change(s). Should a change be made without
> clear marking or delineation, such provision shall be deemed not to be
> a part of this Agreement for any purpose, and shall be replaced with
> the provision of the Standard Form that has been changed or
> eliminated. Any eliminated sections of the Standard Form also shall be
> deemed to be a part of this Agreement unless a reference to its
> deletion is clearly marked in accordance with this paragraph or
> described in a separate cover letter. Addenda, exhibits, attachments
> and riders to this Agreement are not subject to the requirements of
> this paragraph.

**IN WITNESS WHEREOF**, the parties to these presents have hereunto set
their hands and seals, as of the day first above written.

In the presence of:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,
**SELLER**

[RIDER]{.underline}

1\. At the time of closing, the final Certificates of Occupancy shall
have been issued for all work performed at the premises for which
building permits have been issued.

2\. Seller represents, to the best of their knowledge and belief, that
there are no driveways, structures or improvements upon the within
premises which encroach upon an abutting property nor are there any such
encroachments upon the within premises from an abutting property.

3\. Seller represents to Buyer that Seller does not know of any
litigation or other proceedings, whether pending or threatened, against
Seller that could result in a lien or attachment encumbering the
premises on or prior to the closing, or in any manner involves or
affects the premises, and upon any such encumbrance or potential
encumbrance coming to Seller\'s attention, Seller shall notify Buyer
thereof immediately and confirm such notice in writing.

4\. The Seller represents that the appliances and systems are in working
order and will be in working order at closing.

5\. Prior to the closing of title, the Seller will complete the work on
the punch list attached to this Agreement as Appendix B at the Seller's
sole cost and expense.

6\. The time for performance may be extended by either the Seller or
Buyer by written notice for an Excused Delay which materially affects
the Party's ability to close or obtain financing. As used herein an
Excused Delay means a delay caused by an Act of God, declared state of
