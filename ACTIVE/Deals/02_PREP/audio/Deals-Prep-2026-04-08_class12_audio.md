# Audio Prep — Class #12 — Nonprofits — Disclosure and Credibility

**Audio length: ~28 minutes | Listen before class on Wednesday, 2026-04-08**

## INTRO (2 minutes)

Today is disclosure as a response to information and incentive problems, and the immediate follow-up: when is disclosure actually credible?

The course frame stays the same. Information asymmetry can prevent mutually beneficial transactions. Disclosure is the obvious solution. But once you say “disclose,” you immediately hit two problems.

First, why should anyone believe what the insider says? Low-quality actors have incentives to mimic high-quality actors. If mimicry is cheap, disclosure becomes cheap talk.

Second, even if people believe it, how much disclosure is the right amount? Producing and verifying information costs money. Information can also be competitively harmful. So there is a real tradeoff between transparency and cost.

By the end of this prep, you should be able to do three things cleanly:
1. Explain why Easterbrook & Fischel think fraud is inefficient.
2. Explain what an anti-fraud rule does and what it costs.
3. Explain what mandatory disclosure adds, with “network effects” and standardization as the best argument.

---

## PART 1: Why fraud is inefficient (7 minutes)

Easterbrook & Fischel start from an efficiency lens. Investors are trying to allocate capital. They want money to flow to the best projects and managers.

Fraud and unreliable information break that in two linked ways.

### 1) Wasteful verification and duplication

If I can’t trust the issuer, I need to verify. But there are many investors. So many investors spend time and money verifying the same thing. That’s duplication. It’s not just that verification is costly; it’s that the system forces verification to be repeated because no one can fully rely on someone else’s work.

Some investors underinvest in verification because they can free-ride. Others overinvest because they personally want certainty or fear being the one who missed the red flag. Either way, the total system cost is higher than it needs to be.

### 2) Lemons and misallocation

If investors can’t distinguish high quality from low quality, they price all offerings as “average.”

That hurts high-quality issuers. They don’t get paid for their quality. It also helps low-quality issuers. They get overpaid for being bad.

And the dynamic is unstable. Good issuers can exit, leaving more lemons, making investors even more skeptical, raising the cost of capital, and reducing investment overall. That is the classic lemons story: the market can unravel because quality can’t be credibly signaled.

E&F’s additional point fits the course’s “lowest-cost provider” idea. In many settings, the issuer is the cheapest producer of the relevant information. Dispersed investors are not. So there is an argument for a rule that shifts the burden toward the low-cost producer instead of making thousands of investors each do expensive inference and checking.

---

## PART 2: Disclosure without an anti-fraud ban (9 minutes)

Now the thought experiment from the discussion questions. Assume, incorrectly, that fraud is legal. What happens to disclosure?

There are two firms.

Competentco is high quality. Ineptco is low quality.

Competentco wants to separate. It wants investors to recognize it is better so it can raise capital cheaply.

So Competentco has incentive to disclose. It wants to say, “We’re different.”

But the question is whether it has incentive to disclose in a way investors should trust. If fraud is legal, there is no direct legal penalty for lying. So investors expect mimicry.

Now consider Ineptco. What does it want? It wants to pool. If it tells the truth, it gets priced as bad. If it can mimic Competentco, it gets priced closer to average, which is better than it deserves.

So in that world, a lot of disclosure becomes cheap talk. Both firms can say “we are great,” and investors discount.

That pushes the system toward costly signaling.

### Costly signals and why they work

The basic idea is: Competentco needs to do something Ineptco can’t easily do, or can’t do cheaply.

A classic example is third-party certification. Auditors, accountants, investment bankers, underwriters, rating agencies. These are repeat players with reputations. They can sell credibility because they plan to be in the market for a long time. If they certify garbage, that destroys their franchise.

So if Competentco hires a top-tier auditor and agrees to a serious audit and releases audited financials, that is a stronger signal than self-serving disclosure.

But even that is limited.

### Why credibility is still limited

There are two structural constraints.

First, you can’t disclose everything. Some information is proprietary. Some is too voluminous. Some is forward-looking in a way that can’t be fully verified. No one can give a binding promise about every future contingency.

Second, investors do not want to verify everything. Even if the firm releases a ton of information, investors have limited time and limited incentive to check it all. Verification is expensive and has free-rider problems.

So intermediaries help, but they don’t solve the whole problem. They reduce the cost of trust, but they don’t eliminate it.

Now connect this back to another repeated theme in the course: intermediaries solve information problems but create incentive problems.

An auditor is paid by the firm it audits. That creates pressure to please management. An investment banker wants deals to close. That creates pressure to “sell” offerings. So reputational discipline helps, but agency costs don’t disappear.

This is the equilibrium in the no-anti-fraud world: partial disclosure plus expensive credibility mechanisms, all of which can be distorted.

---

## PART 3: What an anti-fraud rule does (6 minutes)

E&F’s claim is not “markets can’t function without law.” It’s more specific.

Markets can produce credibility, but it’s expensive.

An anti-fraud rule can reduce the cost of credible disclosure by making mimicry more expensive.

If lying creates real expected penalties, then low-quality firms cannot as cheaply mimic high-quality firms by making false statements. That helps Competentco separate without spending as much on third-party certification and investor verification.

So the anti-fraud rule acts like an informational warranty. It’s not costless, but it changes the incentive structure.

Now the two limits.

### Limit 1: Under- and mis-enforcement

If the rule is underenforced, bad actors still lie, and investors still discount. So honest firms still need credibility mechanisms, and investors still need some verification.

If the rule is misenforced, it gets worse. If the system punishes firms for being wrong rather than for lying, it chills disclosure. Firms stop making projections. Firms say less. They become vague. That reduces information in the market and pushes investors back toward expensive inference and verification.

### Limit 2: Silence

Anti-fraud rules do not, by themselves, eliminate strategic silence. A firm can stay quiet. Silence is ambiguous. It could mean no news. It could mean bad news. It could mean news that can’t be disclosed without helping rivals.

That ambiguity itself generates costs. Investors spend resources interpreting silence. Firms spend resources managing what silence will be inferred to mean.

So anti-fraud helps, but it is not a full disclosure system.

---

## PART 4: What mandatory disclosure adds (7 minutes)

Now add mandatory disclosure. What does it contribute beyond anti-fraud?

There are two standard arguments.

### Public good logic

Information can be a public good. Once produced, others can use it. The producer can’t capture all the social benefits. That can mean underproduction.

Mandatory disclosure can force production of information that otherwise wouldn’t be produced at socially optimal levels.

But that argument alone doesn’t tell you how much disclosure is optimal. It just tells you why “zero” may not be optimal.

### Standardization and network effects (the stronger add)

E&F have a more distinctive point: standard format and timing facilitate comparison and create an efficient disclosure language.

This is where “network effects” comes in.

A network effect is when a system becomes more valuable as more users adopt it. Think of language itself. A private language is useless. A shared language is powerful. Standardized disclosure is similar. If every firm uses the same terms and format, users can compare across firms cheaply. That lowers search and translation costs. It also limits gamesmanship from idiosyncratic metrics.

This is a genuine justification for some mandatory disclosure: not because firms would otherwise never speak, but because firms speaking in incompatible languages is less useful than firms speaking in a shared language.

Now the risk.

Government can pick the wrong language. Standards can become stale. Firms can optimize to the metric. If overhead ratio becomes the metric, nonprofits will manage overhead ratio rather than mission impact. If earnings per share becomes the target, managers will engineer earnings rather than value.

So the case for mandatory disclosure is strongest when standardization meaningfully improves comparisons and the standard itself is hard to game and still tracks what people actually care about.

---

## PART 5: Nonprofit applications (7 minutes)

Now shift from securities to nonprofits. The same credibility logic applies: donors and boards are outsiders. Managers are insiders. Trust is central. Measurement is hard. That makes disclosure both valuable and fragile.

### Adrian and Bob reporting to donor Diane

Start with the difference between puffery and concrete factual claims.

Saying “this was bold and illuminating and we couldn’t have done it without you” is basically gratitude plus vague framing. That might be ethically questionable if it’s meant to conceal failure, but it’s not a clean factual misrepresentation.

Saying “we can deliver the service just as effectively for half the cost” when that is not accurate is different. That is a factual claim tied to performance and cost-effectiveness. That is the kind of statement donors rely on and that can create real liability and reputational collapse.

Then the incentives. Adrian and Bob may want to shade the truth because they want to protect careers and preserve discretion. Charlotte may want to correct because she doesn’t want to be implicated, because she cares about governance, and because she sees that credibility is an asset that once lost is hard to rebuild.

### Opera ticket sales

If the opera releases ticket sales for the successful production and stays silent about the failing one, the silence becomes informative. Outsiders infer the missing information is bad.

That is the selective disclosure problem. Once you disclose in one direction consistently, silence becomes a signal. That can make “always disclose” a credibility strategy, even if you’d prefer “disclose only good news.”

### University pivot memo and results

This is the donor segmentation issue.

Major donors can often get information privately. Small donors cannot. Rating agencies can sometimes gather. So public disclosure changes who has access, and that changes politics.

Posting online can increase credibility and standardization, but it also increases scrutiny, misinterpretation risk, and internal incentives to manage optics.

### Form 990 and overhead ratios

Form 990 creates some standardized disclosure: compensation, governance, and financials. But it’s weak on impact.

Overhead ratio is then used as a proxy because it’s available. The case for it is that it is easy and can screen out extreme waste.

The case against is that it is easy to game and can push nonprofits to underinvest in management, measurement, and infrastructure even when those are what make programs effective.

### Penelope and Quincy’s satisfaction survey

This is the comparability versus relevance tradeoff.

Quincy wants a common survey so he can compare across grantees. That’s the network effect logic.

Penelope wants outcome measures that track mission impact. That’s the relevance logic.

A credible compromise is often: require a small common core for comparability, plus tailored metrics that actually track outcomes for the program.

## COLD CALL PREP (3 minutes)

If asked why selective disclosure is a problem:

Answer starter: “If you disclose only good news, silence becomes a negative signal. Outsiders infer the missing data is bad. That inference game pushes toward either always disclosing or never disclosing.”

If asked to define network effects in this context:

Answer starter: “A network effect is when a system gets more valuable as more users adopt it. Standardized disclosure creates a disclosure language that’s more valuable because it enables cheap comparisons across organizations.”

If asked about overhead ratios:

Answer starter: “They’re a crude, available metric that can screen out extreme waste, but they’re easy to game and can penalize exactly the investments in management and measurement that improve impact.”

## 60‑SECOND RECAP (1 minute)

> Fraud is inefficient because it forces wasteful verification and distorts capital allocation via lemons dynamics.
>
> Anti-fraud rules reduce the cost of credible disclosure but create enforcement and error costs and don’t solve strategic silence.
>
> Mandatory disclosure’s best argument is standardization and comparability through a shared disclosure language, but metrics can be wrong and can be gamed.

---

## CLOSING (1 minute)

For class discussion, treat disclosure as a tool that always needs a credibility story. If you can name the credibility mechanism and the distortion it creates, you’ll have something useful to say on almost every question today.
