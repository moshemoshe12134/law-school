# **OVERVIEW** {#overview}

| All contracts respond to three central problems: uncertainty, information asymmetry, and agency costs.  |  |  |  |
| ----- | :---- | ----- | ----- |
| *Information Problems* |  | *Incentive Problems* |  |
| **Information Asymmetry** | **Uncertainty** | **Agency Costs** |  |
| When one party to the transaction has more information than the other party.  *Seller* of an asset almost always has better information about it than the buyer does.  Seller’s willingness to sell may cause skepticism about the asset’s quality → make buyer reluctant  **Mitigating measures:** Due diligence Asking questions & inspection are quality/ problems observable, visibility? Look for shifting answers Independent third-party inspector to vet/ vouch  Contingent purchase price  Written representations and warranties, conditions  *Consider:* enforcement → Deferred / escrow payment Earn-outs \- contingency depending upon the earnings of the business or of a particular asset over a period of time Delayed payment (Free returns similar) Staged financing Reporting & disclosure **Vertical integration Make or buy** decision: control v. efficiency Specialization/expertise in VC *Consider:* reputation/ repeat players **Risks** expected to be borne by the party that has greater information / control over the risk  | When information is unknown to everyone (often unknowable) Devany think that when a movie is being made, its chances of success are a matter of uncertainty **Mitigating measures:** Diversification Deferred / escrow payment which gets paid out on satisfaction of a contingency. **Vertical integration** \- greater flexibility (ex. studio era) Pre-release and write contract after w/ more info Revenue/profit sharing  De Vany \- this is the solution in movies b/c you don’t know anything\! **Risks** expected to be borne by party best placed to diversify / insure against it / absorb the loss  Ex: concert venue and rain  | Financial/logistical costs that may arise from conflicts of interest of using third party to make decisions for you. Differing incentives for principal and agent. Different levels of ***diversification*** can effect ***risk tolerance*** Manager generally **not as** diversified when it comes to professional reputation, $$, exits In corporations: divergent incentives between shs and mgmt In public companies ownership is dispersed, hard to monitor effectively & free-riding (Berle \&Means) *Consider*: who is better able to monitor?; if effort is unobservable, need self-motivation  **Mitigating measures:** Align incentives between principal and agent (incentive compensation) equity compensation (conventional options or indexed options) contingent compensation/ revenue sharing (bonuses, M\&A earn out, etc.) *consider* signalling effects; *consider* exposure to risk **Reputation** (in transaction, future transactions, and in market … consider **repeat players**)  For market reputation to function:  the party monitored by the market must anticipate repeated future transactions.   Participants must have shared expectations of what constitutes appropriate behavior.   Those dealing in future must be able to observe how that party has behaved in past dealings  Staged financing/ set fixed terms of length for relationship Change amount of discretion of agent  Avoid vague/unenforcable terms Use objective measures Minimum prices (especially if agent undercut competitor) Allow principal to abandon/terminate Transparency/ reporting & disclosure / monitoring **Vertical integration Make or buy** decision: control v. efficiency **Risks** allocated based on how much discretion agent has |  |

**Moral hazard** \- lack of incentive to guard against certain risks when you are protected from the consequences of those risks

* Distinct from **agency costs** because there may not be a principal-agent relationship   
* *Consider*: provisions for reasonable expenses, need to take advantage of cost minimization, expenses actually incurred  
* Ex: insurance, buyer of clothes who can return them for any reason (not an agent of seller)


**Legal / Regulatory Arbitrage** – doing economically similar transaction which has very different legal / regulatory treatment. 

| synergy        administrability         idiosyncratic     symmetry/ parallel rights         fiduciary duties       leverage       coordination problem       timing      externalities      screening        signaling        ambiguity      caps/baskets       carve outs        risk-allocation        net/gross      coordination         “hold up” opportunities     underinvest   transaction costs           monitoring/enforcement costs          free riding          revenue shifting          search costs       overstated costs/ cost controls       sunk costs |
| :---- |

**Other Themes**

* Transactions are almost infinitely different, but  there are fundamental problems in all of them that are the same.  
* It is pervasive that similar things are treated differently so there is an opportunity for a transactional lawyer to be aware of the differences and to steer her client to the more favorable path.   
* Cooperation requires trust: creative contracting and organizational approaches may be needed to maintain trust and cooperation.  
* If contracts are hard to write, think of alternatives (which are often about governance and control).   
  * Ex: organizations serving as a substitute for contracts, vertical integration  
* The structure of a deal can determine the type of information asymmetries there are and the kind of information that a buyer cares the most about  
* It’s not the court’s place to second guess the deal that sophisticated parties have struck.   
* We have to be rigorously paranoid in transactions, trying to look ahead to those even relatively unlikely scenarios where something can go the way we don't expect, and then we have to think about the language and tweaking the language to cover those scenarios.   
* You have to be mindful of all of your client's goals and understand the commercial objectives.  
* Investments are about more than more than just money. They carry other things and signals. 


# 

# **M\&A** {#m&a}

**Make- or-Buy Decision** \- If a contract is an effective way to manage information and incentive problems, then it makes more sense to buy. In principle, every company wants to buy as much as possible, and make as little as possible. ***However***, if not easy to define in a contract, makes more sense to make it in house and have more control over quality.

* Con of vertical integration: increases fixed costs and reduces flexibility  
* Agency costs can be mitigated somewhat by being a **repeat player** in the market – the 3rd party has an incentive to please in order to secure more business.

**Horizontal Integration/Merger \-** Combination of two companies at the same stage of production. 

* Horizontal mergers have the potential to restrict output and raise consumer prices. (Oliver Hart and Jean Tirole)  
  * The smaller the number of players, the easier it is for them to coordinate/monitor each other/collude. 

### **Vertical Integration** {#vertical-integration}

**Vertical Integration** \-  The combination in one company of two or more stages of production normally operated by separate companies.

* Common ownership across phases leads to flexibility  
* Vertical Integration is **not** illegal per se, but can violate the Sherman act, if company has lots of market power, and their purpose for accumulating market power was to reduce competition. (*Paramount*) \[**Note:** Paramount stands for idea vertical integrtion is anti-competitive, but this is controversial\]   
  * In assessing whether vertical integration is anti-competitive, *consider*:  
    * How much market power is there and how much influence does it give you (true essence); Look at market **subsections**   
      - *Paramount* focused on total market share, rather than the effects on the market. → DS thinks wrong  
    * Intention/purpose of the market power (hard to test)   
  * *But*, vertical integration does not increase share of the market, & does not increase your market power in any single market.  
    * Actually, can help a firm with market power in one market (such as theaters) to leverage that power in another market (such as movie production). Can use control in one market to exert control in other stage (**Hart and Tirole**)  
      - This leverage across markets, is known as **market forfeiture**  
  * **Hanssen \-** vertical integration avoided the need for nuanced contracts that provide for resetting the length of a movie’s run by meeting three needs:  
    * i.	Reduce the need for film-by-film haggling by functioning as a de facto side payment, allowing vertically integrated producers to   
      share in the surplus generated by the early replacement of their unpopular films.  
    * ii.	Reduced (or eliminate) information asymmetries between producers and exhibitors   
    * iii.	Render informal arrangement self-enforcing (which, because it was informal, it needed to be)

### ***Process of M\&A:***  {#process-of-m&a:}

* Sign NDA → limited due diligence and negotiation of terms → Signing of agreement → time lag to do due diligence and obtain regulatory approvals etc → closing (when property is transferred and payment is made).  
* Diligence process:  
  * Usually entails looking through data room, questionnaires and interviewing employees) and incorporating information into the reps and warranties (statements of facts)  
  * Can tailor the due diligence by sending over reps and warranties and seeing the seller’s amendments – focus on the areas of amendment.  
* Part of the purchase price may be held in escrow after closing:  
  *  to allow buyer to assess compliance with reps, warranties and covenants or   
  * as part of an **earnout** or Contingent Value Right (CVR) whereby part of the purchase price is contingent on how well the asset or company does in the future or only payable if a certain post-closing event happens e.g. FDA approval or land zoning approval granted.

**Bargaining tactics:**

* Leverage on other side’s urgency.  
* Show that your demands are what any other party in your position would ask for so the other side has no alternative.

### ***Structure of transactions:*** {#structure-of-transactions:}

| Asset Purchase Generally does not come with accompanying liabilities of *seller* *Buyer* should be indifferent to such liabilities *unless* they attach to the assets e.g. tax liens. *Seller* generally not concerned with liabilities of *buyer unless* part of the purchase consideration is stock or there are instalment payments. If the money is there, we don’t care 🙂 Quality of the assets purchased always important *Note:* If you want to step sellers shoes buying assets doesn’t neccasarily do that (i.e. contracts, leases) |  |
| :---- | ----- |
| **Stock Purchase** Generally **does** come with accompanying liabilities of *seller*.  *Buyer* **should be concerned** about such liabilities. Any problem which arises in asset purchase also arises in stock purchase. |  |

### 

## **Information Exchange** {#information-exchange}

### **Controls Over What Information to Look for and How Hard to Try** {#controls-over-what-information-to-look-for-and-how-hard-to-try}

* It's always a good idea to ask if they know of defects\!

**Gilson**: Some information e.g. exhaustive list of small contracts or other matters in the ordinary course of business may be costly to produce and may not affect valuation significantly. To minimize costs, the parties may agree to limit the scope of seller’s obligation to produce such information 

* Limit the diligence to information already within seller’s actual knowledge or some specified limit on the searches which the seller must undertake.  
* Specify exactly what steps must be taken to search rather than using vague terms like “diligent investigation”  
* Qualify reps and warranties to include only material information or information with a certain dollar value or outside the ordinary course of business

**Freund:** 

* **Materiality qualifiers–**   
  * **Material** \- significant enough that you might care.  
  * **Solutions to concerns about determining level of materiality**: fix objective criteria e.g. a dollar amount.  
  * *Buyer* wants to include materiality qualifiers because he wants to unearth information, wants to be able to walk away if things are not as represented, or wants to claim indemnification if there are any unpleasant surprises after the closing.  
    * **Beware of double materiality** if acting for buyer – if reps contain materiality caveats and the closing conditions also contain a materiality caveat, may be a risk of double materiality – need to show a large number or degree of misreps in order to walk away.  
  * *Seller* wants to exclude materiality caveats because he wants to conceal unpleasant information, avoid expensive/tedious tasks, not willing to furnish purchaser with an out over a minor misrepresentation, or is trying to avoid a claim for indemnification down the road.  
    * **Solutions to seller’s concern about indemnification for small claims:** basket or cushion – list all matters but buyer can only claim indemnification if the aggregate of the items misrepresented reaches a certain level (often aggregated)  
    * **Solutions to seller’s concern about purchaser walking away for minor misrepresentation:** normal indemnification against any misrepresentations but materiality qualifier for what will allow the buyer to walk away.  
  * *Note:* Beware of placement of materiality e.g. “no material breach of any agreement” differs from “no breach of any material agreement”   
* **Knowledge qualifiers** –   
  * *Buyer* should only voluntarily accept a knowledge caveat in a situation where, if seller does not possess the information, he should not be expected to stand behind the representation (e.g. no threatened lawsuits or events that may materially affect the assets or business)  
  * *Buyer* **should not** accept a knowledge caveat if it’s something that the owner really should know.  
    * DS thinks overused, breadth of company often an excuse, “When I have heard it, I say, well, you know, that's what it means to manage a company and you know you're responsible for them, right? And what they do can cause you to be sued.” but often market practice

### 

### **Why share bad news?**  {#why-share-bad-news?}

Seller has the incentive to **APPEAR** truthful in due diligence to **reduce information asymmetry** and make sure that the buyer **doesn’t assume** the worst. Sharing gives seller an **opportunity to spin** the information in their favor and shows **good faith.**

* If more than one reason not to disclose, can **mask** real reason **→** Refusing to share is a negative signal, but with multiple reasons have to decipher  
  * *Neutral pretext*: I’m worried about confidentiality; I don’t have the bandwidth; It will cost me money\!  
  * Can also obscure w/ puffery, burying the buyer (needle in a haystack)  
  * **What can buyer do in response?** → propose various contracts, NDA, bring a third party in, etc., ask questions about track record, process  
* If discovers that seller was lying → serious consequences (more scrutiny independent checks, walk away from the deal, liability, damaged reputation)

### 

### **Who should bear the costs of production?** {#who-should-bear-the-costs-of-production?}

* Providing the seller with information that the **buyer already has** (e.g. identity, location and condition of assets, nature and extent of liabilities, character of employee relationships) **minimizes acquisition costs** for both parties.  
* **Gilson**: when there’s something that’s good for both parties, the party that can do it cheaper should do it, and adjust the price to reflect.  
  * Based on incentive to cooperate so buyer’s don’t make bad assumptions & reduce costs, increasing value of transaction which can be divided  
  * DS: ***but*** consider distinction between incentive to appear or be truthful & if price is largely set already unlikely to adjust unless major change  
* If information will be required by **all potential buyers** costs generally should be borne by the seller since can be reused for all potential buyers.   
  * If **idiosyncratic** preference, buyer should bear costs (also true for remedying problems)

### 


### ***Representations, warranties, closing conditions*** {#representations,-warranties,-closing-conditions}

**Representation** \- statement of fact about current operations of the business.\*\* The buyer’s counsel usually decides what information they want the seller to give.  
\*\*May or may not survive closing  
**Covenant** \- promise to do something before closing the deal  
**Condition** \- things that must happen in order to close; if they don’t happen, the deal is off. 

### 

### **Facilitating the production of previously nonexistent information:** {#facilitating-the-production-of-previously-nonexistent-information:}

* Buyer can ask seller for a rep or warranty  
  * Seller’s refusal to give warranty or qualifiers (knowledge, materiality) *may* be cause for  concern and further investigation  
  * *Also consider:* Reps and closing conditions for governmental approvals  
  * **Remedy:**  
    1. Breach may give buyer an out (if deal not closed yet) or right of indemnification (if deal has closed)  
    2. *Consider* putting part of the purchase price in escrow for a sufficient time to allow seller to investigate truth of reps and warranties.  
* Have an independent 3rd party expert inspect   
  * Who should bear the cost of 3rd party check?  
    1. If most potential buyers would want this information, may be reasonable for this cost to be borne by seller since the information can be reused.  
    2. If only *this* buyer wants this information, may be reasonable for the cost to be borne by buyer.  
    3. Compromise is to have the seller pay if expert comes up with an adverse finding and to have the buyer pay if the expert finds nothing wrong with the property.  
* Reduce the price to reflect risk

## **Material Adverse Change (MAC) Clauses** {#material-adverse-change-(mac)-clauses}

* Often found in merger agreements as a **closing condition** – parties only required to close if **no MAC/MAE has occurred**.  
* **3 parts t**o standard MAC clauses:  
  * First, it says that a deal **can be cancelled if there is a “material adverse change”** w/ effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the seller / target (T). Does not depend on whether the risk was known or foreseeable.  
  * The second component of MAC clauses is a **list of exceptions or carve outs, which do not justify a change**.  
  * Third, **carve-out to carve-out** i.e. excluded events can be MAC if they disproportionately affect the T relative to similarly situated participants in the same industry. May be open question how broadly or narrowly industry defined and who are the other participants  
* **Relying on MAC –**   
  * Walk away from the deal; or  
  * Renegotiate the price. (leverage)  
* **Who bears what risks?**  
  * The buyer bears the risk of economic downturns and other general market conditions  
    * ***Note*** if buyer wants protection against post-closing downside, go for a contingent value right or earn-out instead.  
  * The seller bear the risk of firm-specific problems  
* If **no MAC**, may be able to rely on **breach of covenants** to avoid closing:  
  * interim operating covenants i.e. covenant to operate the biz in the ordinary course between signing and closing; any extraordinary decisions require the buyer’s consent e.g. Victoria Secret M\&A deal which fell apart during COVID-19.  
  * Debt covenants – covenant by T not to breach its debt covenants with its creditors e.g. LVMH-Tiffany deal, where this breach was used to negotiate a lower purchase price; likely need to maintain certain **financial ratios**


  **Rationale for MACs**

1. **US corporate law symmetry explanation**  
   * Sellers have a built-in way to get out of sales: after the directors of the company agree to sell it, shs also need to approve the transaction. If anything changes in between, so that it’s no longer beneficial to sell the company, shs can vote against the sale, and terminate the deal w/o penalty.  
   * There is no corresponding right for the buyer  
   * Sellers have flexibility, but this can also make it harder to generate interest among buyers for close call deals → seller willing to give up its advantage from corporate law to have more and better bids & level playing field w/ a contractual way out in the form of MAC clauses  
     1. Response to uncertainty\!  
2. **Incentive problem**	  
   * If there is a delay between signing and closing (common for complicated deals), then the buyer is depending on the seller to be steward and keep running the business in a way that maximizes value.   
   * However, once the deal is signed, sellers have nothing to gain from good management b/c they usually lose their jobs with the sale of the company.  
     1. Classic moral hazard problem\!  
   * A MAC clause works by saying that “you lose the deal if you don’t run the business as well as other people running similar businesses”  
     1. If something bad happens to the business that's unique to you, or alternatively, there are general economic conditions you aren't navigating as effectively as everybody else. → It's your fault and the buyer can walk away.   
          
        

# **TAX PLANNING & ARBITRAGE** {#tax-planning-&-arbitrage}

**Normative Implications of Tax Planning**

* A tax is “**efficient**” when it changes taxpayer behavior as little as possible. → Generally higher taxes are less efficient\!  
* **Horizontal equity** states that like taxpayers should be taxed alike; **vertical equity** provides that tax should be based on the ability to pay

**Gross Up:** To make a taxpayer whole for a tax of X, the taxpayer must receive a payment of X/(1-T), where T is the taxpayer’s marginal tax rate.

**Tax planning is feasible because economically comparable activities sometimes are taxed differently.** 

* Tax planning strategies include:  
  1. **Exclusion**: Improve their economic situation in ways that are not included in “gross income” for tax purposes.   
     * Ex: **imputed income** \- services rendered to oneself  
  2. **Valuation**: Understate value of what a taxpayer has received, effectively excluding a portion of this value.  
  3. **Conversion**: Convert income that the tax system classifies unfavorably to income that is classified more favorably.  
     * Ex: Biden Carried interest proposal, 83(b) elections  
  4. **Shifting**: shift income from one taxpayer to another taxed at a different rate/time  
     * Ex: Multinationals, TIPs, NQOs/ISOs  
     *  **“Tax accommodation party” or “tax indifferent party” (“TIP”)** \- Entities under different tax laws (like nonprofits)  
       - Can  negotiate among the parties to come to the most preferable terms to both parties   
  5. **Deferral**: Deferring a tax reduces its present value, even if nominal value remains the same.  
     * Ex: timing invoices, NOLs, delaying relization of capital gains  
  6. **Deductions** \[see below\]

### **Conversion** {#conversion}

1. Classify ordinary income as capital gains to get lower rate  
   1. Ordinary income – taxed at max 37% at the federal level  
      1.  Can be paid in kind and is still taxed as ordinary income  
   2. Capital gain \= market value of property – amount paid for it or value when granted  
      1. Capital gains \- taxed at a lower rate of max 23.8% at the federal level, only taxed when realized i.e. sold or disposed of  
2. **Carried interest \-** Limited partner’s share in profits of partnership when realized is regarded as capital gains, even if obtained in exchange for services

### **Deferral** {#deferral}

* Can effectively get an **interest-free loan** by deferring taxes. Interest is charged for 3 reasons: Credit risk, market interest risk, liquidity/ time value of $$.  
  1. More powerful as interests rate rise  
  2. More powerful as the deferral period grows because there’s more room for any investment to appreciate.  
* Owe tax on income generally when income is recieved/realized  
* Can calibrate **derivatives** & use to accelerate losses while deferring gains → important tax planning goal.    
* **Hold on to assets and use them as collateral to borrow money**. No tax payable on the borrowed monies and the repayments can be deducted from taxable income. The frictions from this are less diversification and the risk that the value of the shares may subsequently decline – though this can be mitigated somewhat by hedging.  
* **For personal taxes:** Bequests; Buy, borrow, die. 

The **goal of tax planning is to maximize after-tax returns**, not to minimize taxes. In deciding **whether a tax strategy should be implemented** consider: 

1. **Frictions**: In analyzing whether tax planning is effective, we have to consider non-tax costs associated with the planning strategy, which economists call “frictions.” **If those costs exceed the tax savings, a taxpayer will not pursue the strategy.**  
   * Some parties are subject to more frictions than others  
2. Tax implications for **ALL parties** → **What is the net tax benefit? →** even if only one of the parties can claim benefit, parties are likely to adjust the pre-tax cash flows to share benefit, b/c cooperation is needed to generate the tax benefit  
   * **Calculating benefit for each party** – calculate how much tax they would pay without planning and then calculate how much they would pay with planning. Look at the difference.

   

## **Tax Deductions and NOLS** {#tax-deductions-and-nols}

**Deduction \-** deduction is an amount you subtract from your income when you file so you don't pay tax on it.

* **Gifts** are generally **not** taxable for recipient (or deductible for donor) → Structuring a transaction as a gift usually results in **no net benefit**  
* **Interest** on debts **can** be deducted from taxable income.  
* **Charitable donations** and **net operating losses (NOLs)** **can** be deducted from taxable income.  
* Employers **can** deduct **salary payments**   
  * *Consider* implications for valuation of equity compensation, employee’s gain may be the employer’s loss


### **83(b) Elections** {#83(b)-elections}

* Reduces the amount the company can deduct as compensation. The company can deduct whatever amount the employee claims as salary.   
* In general, an employer will resist having an increase in their taxes to accommodate an employee. However, a VC startup will let employees make an election because startups lose money at first and don’t pay any income tax. 


**NET OPERATING LOSS** 

* You only pay taxes if you make money. If **loss deductions \> income → net operating loss (NOL)**  
  * Economic value of NOL \= tax rate x NOL amount (assuming that NOL can be fully utilized).  
  * Deductions are worth more when tax rate is higher. 	Value \= Amount of tax you can avoid  
* You can **carry forward\*\*** NOLs and use to offset taxable income in other years.

    			**\*\*Carry backs** not allowed currently in U.S.

* **Economic significance of NOLs:** Allows businesses to smooth out income volatility between different years.

**History:**

* Before 2017, NOLs were fully deductible and could be carried back two years and carried forward 20 years.  
* Starting in 2018, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) changed the NOL rules by:   
  * limiting NOL deductions to 80% of taxable income,  
  * disallowing **NOL carrybacks** (refunds to offset taxable income paid in past years), and  
  * lifting the 20-year limit on NOL carryovers.  
* In 2020, Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) Act created a time-limited exception to the no-carrybacks rule:   
  * A NOL from 2018, 2019 or 2020 could be carried back five years. If not enough taxable income in 5th year prior, can apply the remaining NOL to the 4th year prior and so on, until the NOL is used up.  
  * 80% cap on deductions do not apply to these carrybacks or to NOLs used up during 2018, 2019 or 2020\.  
  * Can also be carried forward. However, generally more profitable to carry back since the tax rate was higher (35% vs 21%) prior to 2018\. Also, the 80% cap applies to carryforwards (if applied to tax years from 2021 onwards).   
    * Generally preferable to carry back even w/o these issues because the taxpayer gets the money back faster (time value of money).  
      

### **Additional complexity from reorganization of corporate structures.** {#additional-complexity-from-reorganization-of-corporate-structures.}

**Spin – offs:** New company that contains some of the assets of the old company (parent/holding company). Becomes a sister company..

* **Why spin-off?**  
  * There are costs associated with having disparate businesses together   
  * Harder for shareholders to figure out the company’s worth if they weigh the company’s different asset types differently.  
* **Spun off co may have difficulty applying NOLs to carrybacks** since they may not have filed a separate tax return in the year(s) to which they wish to apply the carryback:  
  1. Can enter into tax matters agreement with parent to apportion past income for purpose of NOL carrybacks.   
  2. But **parent ultimately has to claim the carrybacks** since the spun off company did not file a separate tax return in the past.   
     * Parent will generally only agree to this if it does not have enough NOLs to offset past taxable income itself. If parent is unsure of whether it will have enough NOLs in present year to offset past taxable income, it can either:  
     1. wait until end of tax year to enter into tax matters agreement; or  
     2. make the tax matters agreement conditional upon parent having insufficient NOLs to fully offset past taxable income  
  3. Parent claiming on behalf of spun off co **carries risks** since the spun off co’s tax returns showing NOLs may not have been audited by the IRS yet.  
     * Possible that the refund will be paid to parent and then IRS seeks to claw back some of the refund because it disputes the NOLs of the spun-off co. → This is an issue of information asymmetry and uncertainty.  
     * To mitigate risk:  
       1. Due diligence & independent audit  
       2. Engage a tax expert to do due diligence on spun off co’s books.  
       3. Get indemnification from spun off co – value of indemnity depends on solvency of spun off co (possibly w/ escrow).  
       4. Place part of the refund into escrow instead of just handing it over to spun off co.  
     * Laws can change → should also ask for protections against harm from changes in tax laws

# **DERIVATIVES** {#derivatives}

**Derivatives:** a bilateral zero sum contract whose value derives from some other asset, which is called the underlying. \[Zero sum → One’s loss is another’s gain\]

* Positions in derivatives:  
  * Long position – own or simulate ownership of underlying asset. Generally, in order to profit if you think the price is going to go up.   
  * Short position – sell or simulate selling of asset. Generally, in order to profit if you think the price is going to go down.  
* Derivatives can be physically settled (with delivery of actual underlying asset) or cash-settled (just pay the price difference in cash).  
* **Derivatives are leveraged products** – allow investors to take a position on the value of the underlying asset without paying full price upfront. Key in determining leverage is % of price paid upfront. In decreasing order of leverage: forwards \> options \> actual purchase or sale of underlying asset.  
  * Leverage magnifies risk  
* All derivative products are combo of 3 different building blocks: Forwards, Options, & \[Bonds\] → mix and match to get risk exposure you want

### **Forwards, Swaps & Futures** {#forwards,-swaps-&-futures}

**Forward:** Agreement to buy or sell a fixed amount of an asset at a specific price, on a specific date. Generally customizable.

* Value \= delivery date market price – contract price. This is also the amount of each party’s gain / loss.  
* Forward contracts are **leveraged** – investing with borrowed money since the buyer does not have to pay now to simulate ownership of the asset.  
  * Forward price almost always higher than spot price, but not because the parties predict the price will rise. Price prediction already in market price.  
  * You’re paying a premium to start your investment immediately without paying. You get to keep your money longer, and that’s valuable, because it gives it a chance to grow. This is in effect a loan. You own the gold, but you don’t have to pay for it until years later. In loans, lender compensated with interest. In forwards, the price premium works like the interest.   
* Can synthesize a forward contract with options (see below)

**Swaps** are a series of forward contracts involving exchanges at several future dates. Cash settled at periodic intervals.  
**Futures:** A type of forward contract with standardized terms (fixed price, amount, delivery date), traded on an exchange. 

### **Options** {#options}

**Option:** Contract that gives one party the right *but not obligation* to buy/sell a specific underlying asset or index at a specific price, amount, and date in the future.

* Option definitions:

| Call option – right to buy Put option – right to sell. European option \- permits exercise only on the maturity date. American option \- permits exercise prior to the maturity date.  Unlikely to be exercised prior to expiry date since exercise would result in forfeiture of the time value of the option (see below). Instead of exercising the option, an option holder would just sell the option to monetize both the intrinsic value and the time value. | Strike / exercise price \- Price for buying or selling underlying asset Maturity date – time at or before which the option can be exercised Option writer – seller of option. Option premium – price paid by the buyer to the option writer for the option (fixed amount). In the money – difference between market price and strike price, to the extent favourable to the option holder. Out of the money \- difference between market price and exercise price, to the extent unfavourable to the option holder. |
| :---- | :---- |

* **Profits & Losses:**

| Option holder’s profit \= (difference between market price and exercise price) – option premium. Option holder’s loss \= option premium.  *If* option is out of the money, just let expire without exercising it and you only lose the option premium. This is key difference from forwards. | Option writer’s profit \= option premium Option writer’s loss \= difference between market price and exercise price – option premium Option writer can only lose and never gain at expiration – he has already gotten the option premium at the time of writing and if the option is out of the money, the buyer just lets it lapse. |
| :---- | :---- |

* **Options strategies:**  
  * Can synthesize i.e. replicate a forward contract with options:  
    * Can **synthesize a long position** by *selling a put* option and *buying a call* option at future value of current market price.  
    * Can **synthesize a short position** by *buying a put option* and *selling a call option* at future value of current market price.  
  * **Option spreads**: A spread position is entered by buying and selling options of the same class on the same underlying security but with different strike prices or expiration dates. This allows for allow for specific betting.  
    * E,g, if you believe the price of gold will rise from $1,800 to $2,000, you can buy a call option at $1,800 and sell a call option at $2,000. This creates an opportunity for profit between those 2 values but no profit above $2,000. Purpose is to reduce effective price needed to invest by getting money from selling call option → net premium is smaller. 


**Factors determining option value:**

* The Black-Scholes model requires five input variables: the strike price of an option, the current stock price, the time to expiration, the risk-free rate, and the volatility. 		\*\*note this model is more commonly used in Europe\*\*  
  1. **Strike/ exercise price**   
     * For call option, the lower the exercise price, the higher the expected profits at the maturity date.  
     * For put option, the higher the exercise price, the higher the expected profits at the maturity date.  
  2. **Value/ current market price of underlying asset**:  
     * For call option, the higher the current price, the **higher the expected future price** at the maturity date, which increases expected profits (even if option currently out of the money)  
     * For put option, the lower the current price, the **lower the expected future future price** at the maturity date, which increases expected profits (even if option currently out of the money)  
     * The more deeply in the money the option is, the higher the chance that it will be exercised and the expected profit realized. Therefore, in such a situation, option value will closely track changes in the value of the underlying asset i.e. $1 change in underlying price will move the option price by close to $1.  
  3. **Time until maturity date**: The longer the time until maturity, the more valuable the option is. Because present value of exercise price is lower and there is a higher chance that the option will end up in the money.  
  4. **Variance in asset value:** The more the value of the underlying asset fluctuates, the greater potential for upside for the option holder. We don’t care how low prices can go, because we simply would not use the option.    
  5. **Discount rate**: The higher the interest rate, the more valuable the option since holder needs less money today to exercise the option in the future.  
* Option value \= intrinsic value \+ time value  
  * Intrinsic value is the difference between strike price and current market price.  
  * Time value is the value of the remaining time before the option expires.

### **Uses of derivatives** {#uses-of-derivatives}

* Hedging – reduce or eliminate a current risk that you have; transferring risk to someone else; reduces uncertainty  
  * E.g.insurers selling disaster bonds that pay a lower rate if there is more damage from natural disasters to shift some of hurricane risks to others.   
  * Hedging is not free \- transaction costs involved → generally more attractive to managers than shs, but there are some benefits   
* Speculation – getting exposure to a particular risk that you do not already have; betting on the risk to benefit  
  * Exposure to a risk is valuable because of **diversification** can get opportunities that don't correlate to how the rest of the stock market does.   
* For tax deferral, there was a tax planning strategy, called a “straddle.” \- U.S. tax system now has a rule, called “the straddle rules” so you can’t do this\!  
  * But basic idea of accelerating losses & deferring gains remains important tax planning goal.  Derivatives can be calibrated precisely so still used\!


# **BASICS OF INVESTING** {#basics-of-investing}

**“Castles in the Air” Theory** \- something IS worth what someone else should pay for it (aka greater fool theory)

# 

**Firm Foundation Theory** \- things are worth what they are worth for a reason 

**Fundamental Determinants of Value (Malkiel)**

1. Growth rate (investors want higher growth rate)  
2. Dividends (give direct cash to shareholders)  
3. Risk  
4. Interest Rate (If high enough can invest in other things … lower value of stock because there are alternatives)

**Chartist** \- Someone who relies on past prices to predict future. Key assumption → you can predict the future (Malkiel skeptical)

**“Efficient Market” Hypothesis**

* Weak: Prices reflect all information embodied in past prices → Can’t give you info about future because all information that the market knew is used  
* Semi-strong: Market prices accurate reflect all public information. → no published will help b/c others will also realize, can’t beat market, already integrated  
* Strong: Prices reflect all information that can be acquired by painstaking analysis of the company and the economy. → nothing known or knowable benefit analysts

**Diversificatiom**

* Systematic risk \= Entire market → can’t diversify from this  
* Asystematic risk \= Company specific risk → can diversify from this  
* Should not be compensated for Asystematic risk b/c you don’t need to take this risk … taking it is your mistake  
* Diversification & Efficient Markets: Under efficent market hypothesis (1) not easy to make money by research and analysis so throwing away fee (2) if they are generating more money basically covering that fee… doubtful sharing the surplus → better to be in an unmanaged index  
  * Malkiel recommend the broadest possible market index b/c represents the economy in general → more diversification  
  * *Consider also* More asset classes \= more diversified → You aren’t getting compensated for the risk of not diversifying\!

# 

# **VENTURE CAPITAL** {#venture-capital}

* You have expert investors, trying to mitigate the information asymmetry: The venture capitalists don't know as much as the entrepreneur knows about her idea, but they know enough about the broad landscape that they can engage meaningfully and substantively about the idea.  
* 


### **Contract between VC and start-up** {#contract-between-vc-and-start-up}

* **Typical Structure**: VC fund receives convertible preferred stock in exchange for investment – $$$, connections, subject matter expertise, business advice, signaling (3rd party vouching)  
  * VCs w/ more expertise in area more likely to take active role, consider agency problems & information asymmetry (hard to tell start-up performance)  
  * Creates organization with incentive and authority structures that maximize the potential for success. → An org can substitute for a contract.  
* **It is typical for VC to have greater control rights …** so VC can protect themselves from *info asymmetry* (entrepreneur knows a lot more), reduces *uncertainty* (about what an unpredictable entrepreneur might do), *agency costs* (by aligning interests between the company and VC); *information asymmetry* (having more board members gives more insight in to the workings of the company).  
  * Can also include ***negative covenants*** which forbid certain important decisions without the VC’s consent (should also terminate at exit)  
  * VC loses these control rights at IPO or at sale of the company.   
  * *Consider* even if VC have de jure control, entrepreneurs as insiders have ways to exercise outsized power & reputational effects on the VC  
* Other mechanisms to offset potential problems in VC: Staged financing, VC specialization, payment of entrepreneur in stock,   
  * **Staged financings:** Additional insight is worth more → should expect an expert financer to use this structure and pay for it … reduces info asymmetry, uncertainty, and agency costs (effect on incentives, can reveal CEOs level of confidence)  
    * **Right of first refusal:** The investor has first dibs on an investment opportunity in next round  
    * Allowing VCs to abandon deters excessively risky behavior from entrepreneur, even though more limited financial stake

## 

### **Contract between investors and VC fund**  {#contract-between-investors-and-vc-fund}

* **Typical Structure:** VC fund usually structured as limited partnership. Investors are passive limited partners. Investors usually do not know which individual companies the fund will invest in. General partner puts up 1% of capital but gets almost complete control – contribution is expertise.  
  * Compensation – usually a 2.5% management fee per annum and a 20% **carried interest** (share of profits above a defined rate of return on limited partners’ contributions – usually averaged out over the fund’s lifespan with **claw-back** and **deferral provisions** for limited partners to get back some monies if there are losses in future years)  \*\*Note that **carried interest** is usually taxed as capital gains   
* **Problems:** Agency costs since GP has complete control but little equity. **Solutions:** compensation, mandatory distributions and fixed term.  
  * Regular mandatory distributions and fixed term mean that there is a point in time when the GP’s performance is measured. Performance affects reputation and raising of future funds. This is the solution to information asymmetry and agency costs problems – similar to staged financing. GP usually cannot assign its interest to anyone else without the LPs’ consent. GP also needs to disclose conflicts of interest in investments.

  ## 

**Braiding of contracts \-** structure of the two contracts are intertwined, each operating to provide an implicit term that supports the other, and thereby increasing the contractual efficiency of both.

## **Capital Structure of VC-Backed Startups** {#capital-structure-of-vc-backed-startups}

VC typically recieves convertible preferred stock (convertible at the VC’s option, typically at 0.9 ratio and automatically upon IPO). 

- Common stock \= too much risk, preferred \= not enough upside. The option to convert is valuable (worth the lower dividend payout).  
* **Common Stock** \- the residual claimant. You get what's left after these fixed claims are paid, and the fixed claims would be debt and then preferred stock.   
  - If things go badly, you're the first to lose money and if things go well, you are the first to make money.   
* **Preferred Stock** \- You're there to get your money back and you're not there to make more. And you hope that you're protected from making less, and you're compensated with a dividend & liquidation preference.   
* **Payout in liquidation:** People who are owed money as creditors get paid first, and then what's left goes to the preferred shareholders to pay off their liquidation preference, and whatever's left, if anything, is going to go to the common shareholders.   
* Reasons given for preferring this structure:  
  1. **Dividend preference** of preferred over common stock → limited value in start-ups since they do not generally pay dividends prior to IPO because of limited profits and strong incentive to reinvest capital  (Note preferred *generally* has a higher dividend rate than common stock)  
  2. **Liquidation preference** → limited value in start-ups since they typically have limited assets in the event of liquidation.   
     * Liquidation preference irrelevant in IPO since the preferred stock will usually provide that it converts automatically to common in IPO.   
     * Some limited value in the sale of zombie start-ups (not very profitable but are not insolvent either)  
     * Some commentators argue that giving VCs convertible preferred pushes entrepreneurs to “signal” whether they really believe in their idea.  
  3. **Control** with disproportionate voting rights & BOD representation → there are other ways of securing control e.g. with a shareholders’ agreement allowing VC to appoint a majority of the board. *Also consider*, entrepreneur has significant influence, & both likely want IPO  
     * Allows VC in theory to select the most advantageous exit mode e.g. IPO or M\&A (especially in zombie scenario where there is limited upside for the entrepreneur)   
     * Entrepreneurs double incentive of a) actually walking away with money; and b) having greater control once IPO  
  4. **Tax treatment** (Gilson & Schizer)   
     * By issuing a different security to VC, entrepreneur can receive common stock/options at much lower valuation.  
       * e.g. get common stock at $1/share while VC invests at $100/share. Lower valuation for common stock is justified to the IRS based on the liquidation preference of the preferred shares.   
     * Entrepreneur pays minimal ordinary income tax (taxable income is based on value when they receive it if make an 83(b) election vested value when vested/exercised)   
     * When they sell their stock or options at a later date when the company has become more valuable, their profit on the increased value of the shares is taxed as **capital gains**  – tax on capital gains is at a lower rate and is only applied at the time of realization i.e. sale.   
     * Difficult to replicate this tax advantage using other structures & generally can not be used by mature companies. \[see ppt\]  
     * **Tax Policy**: Favourable tax treatment for entrepreneurs is a government subsidy for such entrepreneurs, which subsidy is contingent on receiving VC funding. Government effectively outsources allocation of subsidies to private VCs who have greater expertise.  
  5. Once capital structure became dominant in the VC industry, efficiencies of standardization entrenched it.

# **REAL ESTATE** {#real-estate}

### ***Dealing with defects in the real estate*** {#dealing-with-defects-in-the-real-estate}

* Who should arrange for repairs?  
  * Generally, seller has less incentive to do the repairs properly so buyer may be want to arrange the repairs himself (w/ price reduction).  
    * Particularly true if specific view about how should be done & other buyers are less sensitive about this issue.  
    * *Consider*: How easy is it to tell how well repair was done?  
* Who should bear the cost of repairs?  
  * If most potential buyers would care about the defect, should be reflected in price.  
  * If idiosyncratic, not likely to be reflects in prive b/c seller can find other buyers willing to buy without repairs or reduction in price.  
  * If uncertain if repairs needed & unable to inspect before closing *consider*:  
    * Delaying (good to sart w/ this  ask first, meet in middle w/ reps)  
    * Representations \+ money in escrow for potential repairs  
      * *Consider*: General carve-out for aesthetic issues \+ a carve-out from that carve out for aesthetic issues caused by safety issues.   
    * Changing the purchase price, add conditions

| Due Diligence Checklist for buyer: Check title of seller Look at previous conveyances and other title documents to ascertain this. Determine the nature of title – leasehold, freehold etc. Conduct searches with the land titles office to ascertain whether any registered encumbrances on the property. Verify identity, capacity and authority of seller: Residence and nationality of seller may be relevant to whether governmental consents are required for sale. Identify all owners, in cases of joint ownership. Where the seller is a legal person e.g. company etc, check constitution documents to ascertain capacity to own and transfer property. Also check that the representative is duly authorized e.g. with a power of attorney. Where the property is held by a minor or person of unsound mind, Court approval may be required. Land-use permissions: Verify that property is currently in compliance with the local land-use plan. Governmental approvals: If a building or part thereof is purchased, buyer should check compliance with the building / layout plan approved by the local authorities. Seller must obtain an occupancy certificate from a competent authority to allow persons to move into the building. Taxes and expenses: Non-payment of property taxes constitute a charge on the property. Check that seller has paid all utility bills, to avoid liability for the same. Physical survey: Check condition of buildings, boundaries and access to the property. Aesthetic (rather than safety) issues often need to be rectified by buyer. What about matters that cannot be properly DD within the time for closing? Delay closing; or Insert reps and warranties and hold some of the purchase price in escrow to cover the cost of remediation. Escrow provision should provide for a 3rd party expert to certify that remediation required and the cost of remediation. |

# **LITERARY AGENTS** {#literary-agents}

| Economic problems which publishing houses face: Uncertainty which books will be commercially successful Author does not bear most of the upfront promotion costs which are incurred by the publishing house (moral hazard) Mitigated by dealing with literary agents of authors. Literary agents are preliminary screening too which reduce search costsl.  Agents are repeat players so have: interest in maintaining their reputation → the fact that they are willing to promote a work signals its quality.  better judgment than authors about marketability of the work. Can selectively market to publishing houses good fit | Economic problems when authors deal with agents: May seek to maximize own benefit rather than the benefit of the author Solutions are fiduciary relationship and fixed term / termination provisions. Literary agent is fiduciary of author.  Author has an incentive to terminate the agency once negotiations with a publishing house have begun (Moral hazard) Solution lies in termination provisions. Uncertainty as to which books would be commercially successful Solution is commission arrangement, perhaps with a nonrefundable fee payable by 1st time authors. |

# **MOTION PICTURES** {#motion-pictures}

**Three vertically linked activities in motion picture industry:**

1. **Production** (making motion picture using actors, sets, and film),  
   2. **Distribution** (passing motion picture prints from producer to exhibitor and from exhibitor to exhibitor), and  
   3. **Exhibition** (showing motion picture prints to the consumer)  
* **Exhibitors** have a short term interest in striking very favorable terms with **producers** but a long term interest in keeping producers in business. Don’t want them to give up making movies  
* **Distributors** have a short term interest in renting the film widely, but a long-term interest in being more selective to protect their relationships with **exhibitors** and earn licensing income on future films. 

→ While producers, distributors, and exhibitors all have an interest in cooperating–if only because they all depend on each other– they have short-term incentives      
      to take advantage of each other, and opportunities to do so arise because they perform their obligations at different times. 

- As a result, creative contracting and organizational approaches are needed to maintain trust and cooperation. In a vertically integrated world not issues but are so we need special solutions


## **Key Problems in Motion Picture Distribution** {#key-problems-in-motion-picture-distribution}

### **Uncertain Film Revenues Prior to Release (DeVany & Hanssen)** {#uncertain-film-revenues-prior-to-release-(devany-&-hanssen)}

* **Very difficult to predict what consumers will like prior to release.** This is because of unique nature of each motion picture, wide array of entertainment choices, individual preferences and both private as well as public signals. Movie stars may influence the floor but not the ceiling of revenues.  
* Most revenues are **earned by just a few very successful movies**, rather than by average movies. About 5% of movies earn 80% of industry profits.   
  * There are low marginal costs for exhibiting a movie to more people, which allows very popular movies to generate a lot of additional revenue without a corresponding increase in costs.  
  * Problem compounded by fact that production and distribution are sunk costs incurred before exhibition.   
* Costly to commit to certain run times etc when there is no certainty as to how well it will do.  
* **What determines revenues?**  
  * Immediately after release, revenues are determined primarily by opening revenues (which may depend on budget, advertising for the movie, the presence of stars etc.)   
  * After first four weeks from release (defining moment), revenues are determined primarily by **information** that consumers have about the movie (through word of mouth or other forms of communication from previous viewers) 

**Response to Uncertainty**

* **Diversify:** Invest in a portfolio of different types of movies (**DeVany)**  
* **Adjust film runs after release**: If you can’t predict how well a film will do, pre-release & adjust run of movies based on success– through techniques such as contracts with **penalty clauses** for early withdrawal by exhibitors, and vertical integration (**Hanssen)**  
  * Hanssen suggests that **vertical integration** allowed for a greater degree of renegotiation of film runs after release.  
    * Once vertical integration prohibited, parties would often do a pre-screening at select locations to test the market before writing contracts.  
* **Profit-sharing** in contracts spreads the risk from uncertainty. More successful films will produce greater returns for the participants and vice versa.

### **Information asymmetry**  {#information-asymmetry}

* Exhibitor often has greater familiarity with the local market than the producers or distributors and have an advantage in setting price (can under-report revenues or convert ticket sales into other revenues such as F\&B sales to reduce royalties).   
* Producer/distributor has better information about the quality of the movie. According to de Vany and Hanssen, this information is not reliable since nobody can know how a movie will perform in advance

### **Paramount barred terms in industry contracts that were deemed to be integrative or otherwise anti-competitive, including:** {#paramount-barred-terms-in-industry-contracts-that-were-deemed-to-be-integrative-or-otherwise-anti-competitive,-including:}

* Vertical integration of distribution with exhibition  
* Minimum Price  
  * Court deemed this minimum ticket price an illegal price fixing conspiracy  
  * De Vany: low barrier to enter the market so plenty of competition against current theaters; also keeps theaters from undercutting each other  
    * also helps prevent strategic behavior such as revenue shifting or lying about price, one less thing to monitor lowering transaction costs  
* Multi-Movie Clearances \- Period of time when a movie can only be shown by one exhibitor in a particular area.  
  * Court: “A clearance when used to protect that interest of the exhibitor was reasonable, when not unduly extended as to area or duration.”   
    * Court focused on the contractual terms and ignored the fact that run times were adjusted **ex post**.  
    * **3 factors that courts consider** in deciding whether a clearance can be granted: **(a)** Location (proximity of 2 theaters); **(b)** Quality (distributor has legitimate interest in showing movie in a better theater) \+ customer reviews **(c)** Size of the theater  
  * **De Vany**: Since these variables don’t usually change, distributors can repeatedly make this analysis and come out with the decision to show their movie in the same theater over and over again, without it being anti-competitive. → courts disagree  
* Block-booking and blind-selling \- selling films in bundles before they had been made.   
  * Court said it was anti-competitive to force exhibitors to take both inferior films and superior films.   
    * *However*, DeVany says this is not persuasive because prior to distribution, impossible to know which films would do well. Even if possible, a more straightforward way to use this information is to simply charge more for the superior films.   
      * Also, efficiencies from standardization of contracts across several films. 	  
    * Roy Kenney and Benjamin Klein argue that block booking was designed to prevent “oversearching,” but there are other ways for unsuccessful movies to be treated differently   
* Formula deals \- royalty is based on ticket sales nationally, not just in the specific theater showing the movie   
  * Ways of the information asymmetry between the exhibitor and the distributors / producers. Court held that they favoured larger exhibitors.   
    * However, DeVany says reasonable way of reducing underreporting of revenues by exhibitors  
* Blanket deals – licensed film in \>1 theatre operated by same exhibitor. Exhibitor has discretion to choose which of their theaters should display the films.  
  * Court held that these were anti-competitive since they favoured larger producers.   
  * DeVany says these were reasonable since they allowed the exhibitor to exploit his superior local knowledge for the benefit of all parties.   
* Franchise \- license for all exhibitors for more than one season 

### **Profit-sharing Contracts** {#profit-sharing-contracts}

**Profit-Sharing Deal Between the Producer and Talent: Net & Gross  Profits**  
In a **profit-sharing deal between the producer and talent**, the actor/director gets a fixed fee plus a contingent fee or certain percentage of profits above a certain break-even point. The key to understanding how much the actor / director gets is the definition of profits (gross or net) and the break-even point.

* With **net-profits** formula, where the actor / director only gets the contingent payout if **Net profits \= \[Adjusted gross receipts from film – Production costs – Distribution fees\] \> breakeven point**  
  * Definition of adjusted gross receipts (particularly the % from home videos which is typically lower than the % from theatre tickets), distribution fees, and certain overheads (formula for allocating fixed costs to each movie) can be manipulated by studios to artificially depress net profits and reduce payouts to net-profit actors / directors.   
    * Overheads/revenues need not be actually computed for profit-sharing purposes, computed based on how defined in contract.   
      - **Overhead** \- General administrative expenses for motion picture production and advertising.   
* To counter manipulation by studios, some stars negotiate for **gross participation**. Best treatment for actor / director is 1st dollar gross participation, usually reserved for superstars, where the   
  * Generally, actor / director gets the contingent payout if **Adjusted gross receipts \> \[advance paid to actor / actor’s % share\]**. e.g. Eddie Murphy would have received no contingent compensation until the film’s gross revenue exceeded his advance ($8 million) divided by his 15% share, or $53 million.   
  * Gross participations encourage stars to participate in marketing for the movie since they share directly in profits  
* Gross participants start sharing before any deductions for production or distribution costs → Increase production costs and reduce payouts to net-profits actors / directors.

**Profit-sharing in Contracts Between Producers and Exhibitors**

* Theatre usually keeps all concession revenue e.g. food and beverage revenue.  
* Exhibitor keeps all ticket revenues up to a breakeven point and then shares profits over that.   
  * Often, will reduce the producer / distributor’s share as the length of the run increases – Goldberg say that these are needed to incentivize exhibitor to incur marketing costs at the local level to drum up ticket sales as the effect of the producer’s marketing fades over time.  
* Variants on the usual contract:   
  * For independent theatres showing a late run, theatre will often pay a fixed fee and keep all receipts since it is the exhibitor who has to incur most marketing costs.   
  * For 4-wall arrangements, exhibitor charges distributor a fixed fee and takes none of the receipts since distributor is incurring all marketing costs. 

**Distributor-subdistributor contracts:**

* Subdistributor pays a a lump sum based on expectations about the film's performance plus profit sharing above breakeven point   
  * Breakeven point is a rolling breakeven that rises with the subdistributor’s expenditure, because most of the advertising will be on subdistributor.   
  * **Goldberg**: Profit-sharing solves information asymmetry between the producer and exhibitor / sub-distributor by sending a signal about the producer’s belief in the movie’s quality (since he is willing to accept contingent compensation) and gives the producer an incentive to produce the movie to cater to foreign markets, as well as to engage in some post-production marketing. (this is like an earnout)

**Economic rationales for profit-sharing deals in production**

* If the goal of contingent compensation is to motivate the talent to do better work, the condition that triggers the compensation need to be chosen carefully: the talent should be rewarded for effort and for adding value, and the reward should be withheld when they don’t do a good job.  
  * Net-Pay not a very effective way to do this; Gross somewhat better; Overall, unclear how effective efforts can be, so likely something more here  
1. Proftit sharing as **incentives for the party that plays a more important role at a given time**. (**Goldberg**)  
   * Generally, net profits clauses only fail to produce a payout when there is a gross participant e.g. a top star in the movie. If movie is not made with gross participants, the net profits could be substantial.  
     * Net profit participants are willing to give up profits to add gross participants because they increase the likelihood of the movie being produced and actually receiving their fixed (pay or play) payment.   
     * Adding gross participants also makes the movie more likely to be a commercial success & make more $, which allows producers and other net participants to command a higher salary in future movies – important because net participants are generally hired on a per-movie basis.   
   * Producer’s contract may have an **overbudget penalty clause** that cuts his net profits participation since producer has most control over costs.  
     * Cost control is more important for a movie without famous cast members, because more viewership for movies with famous cast members, whereas movies with unknown actors only profitable if costs lean.   
   *  Profit-sharing also information asymmetry between the producer and exhibitor / sub-distributor by signaling about the producer’s belief in the movie’s quality. *However*, Goldberg thinks this rationale is less important than the incentive rationale.  
2. Profit-sharing as **risk-sharing:** net profits are not a good way of motivating talent since they often fail to pay out even if the movie is successful. Also, no point in incentive compensation since revenue is unpredictable. (**DeVany**)   
   * Very skeptical about incentive explanations, the point of contingent arrangements is risk sharing  
3. Profit-sharing as a **device for distributing risks and addressing information asymmetry** (Weinstein)  
   * Profit-sharing is a risk-sharing device between studio and talent (to cope with uncertainty).   
     * Studio shareholders are generally diversified and should be risk-neutral. However, studio executives are risk-averse (due to increased turnover within the industry and their inherent lack of diversification in their income) and are reluctant to show losses.   
       - Thus, they have incentive to convert fixed costs into variable costs (which are less risky). This spreads risk from studio to talent.  
   * A sharing contract may provide protection against the informationally advantaged party.   
     * The producer may know, or the star may think the producer knows, more about the likely box office for the movie in question than the star. In that case, the star knows that, even if he and the studio could agree on the marginal contribution that the star adds to the movie, fixed-salary contracts put him at a disadvantage. The studio has every incentive to understate the anticipated revenues from the film.  
   * Profit-sharing solves an information asymmetry problem since the talent may have private information about how interested he is in making the movie and the studio may have private information about the likely success of the movie.   
     * However, Weinstein notes that private information about the likely success of the movie is not always reliable.  
   * Actors only get hired for single movies. That, in and of itself creates incentive to do their best for every movie and performance easy to monitor.  
     * There is a reputational market for talent – the industry is rather small, talent is hired on a per-movie basis and must recontract for each new movie, and directors are highly skilled at assessing the performance of talent. 

   

   

# **NON-PROFITS** {#non-profits}

## **Nonprofits as a Solution to Information and Incentive Problems** {#nonprofits-as-a-solution-to-information-and-incentive-problems}

Henry Hansmann: A “nonprofit organization is, in essence, an organization that is barred from distributing its net earnings, if any, to individuals who exercise control over it, such as members, officers, directors, or trustees.”

* This prohibition on the distribution of profits \= **the nondistribution constraint**  
* If nonprofit earns more than it spends, this surplus has to be invested in the mission → reassures beneficiaries that the nonprofit is less likely to overcharge them to extract higher profit, since professionals and volunteers can’t keep it themselves

## 

**Strengths & Weaknesses of Non-Profits** 

* **Mission & Goals:** Mission also a defining feature (goal NOT to maximize revenue)  
* **Motivation:** Motivation of nonprofit volunteers and professionals can give nonprofits an important advantage when competing with for-profits.    
* **Diversity**  
* **Autonomy**  
* **Funding**: supplied voluntarily  
  * How does a non-profit accomplish price discrimination → letting people donate  
  * **The Double Utility of Giving \-** Both recipient and giver becomes happier  → Donations produce a double utiltty

**How can nonprofits come up with the right strategy?**  
Plan, Persevere, Prioritze, Pivot, Publicize, Partner

**Promoting Public Good**

* **Externality** \- Some cost that is not borne by people in the transaction  
  * Externalities can create incentive problems… don’t care b/c costs won’t fall on them   
  * **Negative externalities** are a type of market failure → Whenare present, the market will supply too much of the relevant good or service compared to total social cost.  
  * **Positive externalities** are a type of market failure. When they are present, the market will supply too much of the relevant good or service.  
  * An important function of nonprofits, and of government subsidies to them, is to address positive/negative externalities.  
* **Public Good** \- a commodity or service that costs the same–regardless of how many people use it and is available even to those who don’t pay for it.   
  * An important function of nonprofits, and of government subsidies to them, is to provide public goods.  
  * Tax subsidies & govt support help to make up for negative externalities and counter **free riding**/incentive problems  
* Nonprofits (and subsidies for their work) can be used to solve **coordination problems**.  
* Either the government or nonprofits can provide public goods and respond to market failures. may be preferred when:  
  * Government preferred “economies of scale,” (a) more cost effective to do this for everyone at same time  & (b) bigger projects you may need tax $  
  * Nonprofits can experiment/ take on possibly controversial causes that are harder for govt (ex: clean needles, social movements) better

**Information Asymmetry Problems Limited by Nonprofits**

* In nonprofits information asymmetry problem → due either to the circumstances under which the product is purchased and consumed or to the nature of the product hard to monitor/ evaluate quality   
  * Common case → not the person receiving the service/good, even if not inherently hard to measure increases monitoring costs  
* Another information asymmetry problem → don’t know how donation going to be used / how important it is  
  * Can use contract to use donations in certain ways/ set restrictions on their use pretty effectively  
  * Harder to tell how it impacts chosen cause/ whether other money can be siphoned out → mission a check on this, but not complete protection

## **Nonprofits as a Source of Information and Incentive Problems** {#nonprofits-as-a-source-of-information-and-incentive-problems}

**Fundamental Challenge: Assessing Quality of Choices**

* Difficulty in measuring performance, which then translates into greater cover for people to do what they want to do, which isn't always the best thing to do 

**Inertia (Information & incentive problems\!)**

* Inertia is a challenge at every institution, but can be a greater challenge for non-profits b/c  
  * Outcomes and effects are harder to measure (both fundamental measuring issue and value laden judgements about mission)  
  * There’s less pressure for profit and to adapt  
* Every organization needs standard operating procedures to do its work, but nonprofits can be hesitant to change  theirs  
  * Could be comfortable with current system or think it worked in the past it could work again.   
  * Harder to compromise/ change b/c commitment to mission → high level of feeling

**Agency Problems**

* **The nondistribution constraint** is a leaky constraint b/c there are non-cash incentives nonprofits can provide  
* Unpleasant, hard, and unpopular decisions don’t have financial stake for extra incentive to leaders \- less likely to happen  
* Although nonprofit managers and board members do not have a personal financial stake in ensuring that a nonprofit runs efficiently, they still are motivated to avoid waste b/c reputation, competition, & mission.

**How to Save the World suggests ways to deal with incentive and information problems at nonprofits.** 

* What are the two goals nonprofits need to pursue?  
  * **Figure out right things to do with analysis \&data (and considering alternative solutions)**  
  * **Get everyone on board to do it (buy in)**  
    * Bad for morale to just tell people what to do  
    * Give people clear sense of what contributions will be  
    * Everyone should understand how they fit into broader goal  
* There are synergies in these tasks → help you come up with the right strategy and sell it effectively  
  * Sophisticated donors worry about inefficency, so more likely to invest

**Planning \- You can’t make every deciaon but you can influence how other people make decisons** 

* An effective planning process helps a nonprofit allocate resources where they are needed the most.  
* An effective planning process helps build support internally among a nonprofit’s professionals, the board, and the nonprofit’s donors.  
* Should promote effective cooperation/coordination; prevent silos  
* Want to motivate people to make decisions thoughtfuly and rigorously   
  * *Consider*: peer review or having teams debrief each other, multiple budgetary scenarios, having a detailed written plan, regular updates

**How to Save the World suggests allocation resources based on three questions**. 

1. How important is the problem we are trying to solve?  
   1. don’t just follow the money  
      2. the more specifics you get the more answerable the question becomes  
   2. How effective is our response?  
      1. Difference between an “output” and an “outcome”: Output \= what we are doing; outcome \= effect; outcome is more impt  
      2. Impact multipliers  
   3. Are we the right organization to respond?

	AVOID MISSION CREEP\! \- don’t just mollow the money

## **Disclosure as a Response to Information and Incentive Problems**  {#disclosure-as-a-response-to-information-and-incentive-problems}

**Fraud is inefficient (E\&F)**

* Accurate information is necessary to ensure that money moves to those who can use it most effectively and that investors make optimal choices about the contents of their portfolios. A world with fraud, or without adequate truthful information is a world with too little investment, in the wrong things to boot.  
* Certification methods are costly → direct verification of claims by thousands of buyers would be very expensive  
  * The penalty for fraud makes it more costly for low-quality firms to mimic high-quality ones by making false disclosures.   
* While could say fraud is essentially just a transfer of value, it’s bad b/c it has incentive effects & causes information problems

**E\&F say that a ban on fraud (without a requirement to disclose) can help reduce information asymmetry**

* Silence means bad news. A firm with a good project, seeking to distinguish itself from a firm with a mediocre project (or no project at all), would disclose the optimal amount of information. That is, it would disclose more and more so long as the cost of disclosure (both direct costs of dissemination and indirect costs of giving information to rivals) was worthwhile to investors as a whole.  
* Given these devices, a rule compelling disclosure seems redundant, and if the fraud penalty and verification devices do not work, a rule compelling disclosure is not apt to be enforceable either  
* Without a ban on fraud, information is not totally unreliable, but a ban on fraud: Makes it costlier to lie & Reduces verification costs 

**E\&F analyze what (if anything) a rule requiring disclosure adds to an anti-fraud rule.**

* Mandatory disclosure makes staying silent harder  
* Even without mandatory disclosure, firms have incentives to share both good and bad news.

**NONPROFITS**

* Even when nonprofit professionals and boards are tempted to offer misleading information, they still have reasons not to do so.  
  * Sharing information not misleading will tell pp what went wrong and they can gain a benefit from learning  
* Nonprofits have strong incentives to share good news.  
* Nonprofits might hesitate to share bad news but, if they don’t, others may assume the news is worse than it is, so they should release this news as well.  
  * Potential to benefit credibility   
* Form 990s & overhead ratios currently used for nonprofit disclosure, but not great → DS thinks there should be more self-disclosure/evaluation
