## 1. Stock Deals vs. Asset Deals - The Core Structural Choice

### A. What is the difference?

**Stock Deal:**
- Buyer purchases the stock (shares) from shareholders
- Counterparty is the shareholders, not the corporation
- Buyer gets the corporation with ALL assets AND ALL liabilities
- The corporate entity remains intact
- All contracts remain in place (no need to transfer them)
- Buyer "steps into the shoes" of the seller

**Asset Deal:**
- Buyer purchases specific assets from the corporation
- Counterparty is the corporation itself
- Buyer chooses what assets to acquire
- Liabilities generally do NOT transfer
- Seller keeps unwanted assets and liabilities
- Contracts may not transfer (may require consent)

**Exam Insight:** #EXAM_SIGNAL The fundamental trade-off is about what risks you're acquiring. Stock deals preserve the business but bring all liabilities. Asset deals let you leave liabilities behind but may lose favorable contracts.

### B. Patent not properly filed - Who needs to worry?

**Asset Deal:** Buyer doesn't need to worry - if the patent isn't among the assets purchased, Buyer doesn't inherit the problem.

**Stock Deal:** Buyer needs to worry - Buyer inherits all assets including the improperly filed patent.

**Theme:** Asset quality matters in both structures, but only stock deals automatically inherit the problems.

### C. Cheap lease with change-of-control provision

**Asset Deal:** Buyer needs to worry - if Seller is no longer the counterparty, the lease may expire. Buyer would need landlord consent or a new lease.

**Stock Deal:** Buyer generally doesn't need to worry - the corporate entity remains the same, so the lease counterparty doesn't change.

**Exception mentioned:** Some leases have "change of control provisions" that terminate the lease even in stock deals. This is rare but something to check for.

**Exam Insight:** #EXAM_SIGNAL If preserving favorable contracts is important (like below-market leases), a stock deal is generally better because it preserves contractual relationships.

### D. Unpaid taxes - Who bears the risk?

**Asset Deal:** Buyer generally doesn't worry - tax liabilities stay with the selling corporation.

**Stock Deal:** Buyer needs to worry - Buyer inherits ALL unpaid taxes (income, payroll, sales, property taxes, penalties, interest).

**Exception mentioned:** Tax liens can "jump" from assets to sale proceeds, but generally the analysis holds.

**Exam Insight:** #EXAM_SIGNAL Stock buyers must do extensive tax due diligence because they inherit all tax liabilities. This is perhaps the most important difference between the two structures.

### E. Terminated employee for harassment

**Asset Deal:** Buyer doesn't worry - the employment liability stays with Seller (unless Buyer hires the employee).

**Stock Deal:** Buyer needs to worry - the terminated employee could sue the company for harassment that occurred before the sale.

**Theme:** Employment-related liabilities travel with the corporation in stock deals but stay behind in asset deals.

### F. Due diligence intensity varies by deal structure

**Key point:** Asset deals are "the lighter lift" for due diligence.

Because liabilities generally don't transfer in asset deals, the buyer doesn't need to investigate all corporate liabilities as thoroughly. Stock deals require much more intensive investigation of ALL corporate obligations.

**Quote from professor:** "I have vivid memories... people would come in and say sorry, we have this deal... but the good news, it's an asset deal, so it won't be as hard."

### G. When does Seller need to worry about Buyer's problems?

**General rule:** Seller doesn't worry about Buyer's tax or other problems because the relationship ends at closing.

**Exception - CONTINGENT PAYMENTS:** If part of the purchase price is paid later (e.g., earnout), Seller suddenly cares about Buyer's creditworthiness. Seller is effectively lending money to Buyer and needs to know if Buyer can pay.

**Exam Insight:** #EXAM_SIGNAL When purchase price is deferred or contingent, reverse due diligence becomes necessary - Seller must verify Buyer can pay.

## 2. Due Diligence: Cooperative or Adversarial?

### A. The theme park case - Seller's new video game ride

**Buyer wants user data** to assess whether the ride will be successful and value the business appropriately.

**Seller should provide it** because:
- It's historical factual data (not speculative predictions)
- Withholding suggests bad news
- Providing it facilitates the deal at the right price

**This supports Gilson's view:** When information is factual and already exists, sharing it creates value for both parties. It's cooperative, not zero-sum.

**Theme:** Due diligence works cooperatively for past facts that are objectively verifiable. The problems arise with future predictions and proprietary information.

### B. Movie focus group data - facts vs. predictions

**Buyer wants focus group reactions** to predict movie success.

**Seller is more concerned** because this is about the FUTURE (predictions), not the PAST.

**Key distinction:**
- Past facts (game user data): Objective, verifiable, less legal risk
- Future predictions (movie focus groups): Speculative, subjective, more legal risk

**Theme:** Cooperation works well for historical facts but becomes more complicated when dealing with forward-looking predictions.

## 3. The Strategic Disclosure Problem - Carol's Drug Trials

### A. The core incentive problem

Carol's drug trials show the drug works BUT has potential side effects.

**Without legal constraints:** Carol would share the good news ("it cures colds!") and hide the bad news (side effects).

**Legal constraint:** Carol can't LIE, but she can refuse to answer.

### B. The inference from silence

**Key insight:** #EXAM_SIGNAL If Carol refuses to share trial information, Doug will assume the WORST.

**Professor's framing:** "Even though in a commercial setting we often have the freedom to say I'm not gonna answer that question, it's not a cost-free choice because our counterparty is gonna think, whoa, why is it they don't wanna tell us. Must be because it's bad news."

### C. Disclosure incentives for bad news

**Counterintuitive result:** Sellers have an incentive to share bad news, not just good news.

**Why?**
- If you say nothing, people assume the WORST
- The actual bad news is probably better than what they imagine
- Sharing bad news prevents them from assuming something catastrophic
- Example: Side effects might be "causes a rash" (bad) vs. what they imagine ("kills you and your entire family")

**Theme:** #EXAM_SIGNAL In a world where silence is interpreted as bad news, disclosing bad information allows you to control the narrative and prevent worst-case assumptions.

### D. Strategic refusals - the pretext problem

**The complication:** Carol can offer a neutral reason for not disclosing (e.g., "you're a competitor, I don't want you to have my proprietary research").

**Buyer's problem:** Can't tell if Carol is:
1. Hiding terrible results, OR
2. Genuinely concerned about competitive harm

**Professor's key formulation:** "Sellers don't necessarily have the incentive to be truthful, they have the incentive to SEEM truthful - and they're not actually the same thing."

### E. Testing Seller's excuse - escalation strategies

**Buyer's responses to test whether the excuse is real:**

1. **Offer confidentiality agreement:** "We won't share this information and won't use it to compete." If Carol still refuses, probability of hiding bad news increases.

2. **Offer neutral third-party review:** "Choose a scientist at a university to review trials and answer only whether there are serious side effects. We won't see the compounds." If Carol still refuses, it's even more likely she's hiding something.

**Theme:** #EXAM_SIGNAL Strategic refusals with plausible explanations create information asymmetry. The more Seller rejects reasonable protections, the more Buyer should assume the worst.

### F. The paranoia principle

**Professor's advice:** "Please do be paranoid. Don't take things at face value in a transaction. Recognize that there may be strategic reasons why people invoke what sounds sensible, but maybe it isn't their real reason."

**But with a caveat:** Building a reputation for truthfulness has long-term value. "It takes a lifetime to build a reputation and 5 minutes to destroy it." Being actually truthful (not just seeming truthful) creates easier negotiations and better terms over time.

## 4. Gilson's Cooperative Thesis - Limits and Realities

### A. Gilson's claim

Parties have incentives to be truthful in due diligence because:
- Silence is interpreted as bad news
- Efficient information production maximizes deal value
- Both parties benefit from reducing information asymmetry

### B. Where the thesis works

- When information is factual (past data, not predictions)
- When information already exists (low cost to provide)
- When both parties want accurate pricing

### C. Where the thesis has limits

**Strategic refusals:** Sellers can offer benign reasons for withholding that mask bad news. Buyer can't distinguish the real reason.

**The theme park example - shareholder ask:** What if Carol says she won't share trials because Buyer is a competitor and she doesn't want them stealing her research if the deal doesn't close? This is a legitimate concern that creates ambiguity about whether she's hiding something.

**Theme:** #EXAM_SIGNAL Cooperation works when incentives align. When parties have legitimate reasons to withhold information (competitive concerns, proprietary costs), the cooperative model breaks down because bad faith and good faith refusals look the same.

---

## 5. Cost Minimization in Information Production

### A. The litigation files problem

Carol can either:
- Have her lawyers summarize litigation: Costs $10,000
- Let Buyer's lawyers read files: Costs Buyer $50,000

**Gilson's argument:** Carol should produce the summary because she's the "least cost provider." The total deal value = Purchase price + Transaction costs. Minimizing total costs benefits both parties.

### B. The price adjustment problem

**Gilson says:** If Seller makes due diligence more expensive, they can be "made to pay" through purchase price adjustment.

**Professor's skepticism:**
- Due diligence costs don't typically get renegotiated in purchase price
- Different people handle pricing vs. due diligence
- Each side hopes the other will bear the costs

### C. Strategic obfuscation - the "here are the keys" strategy

**Evil Carol's strategy:** When asked to summarize pending litigation, she says:
- "We don't have the big legal department you have"
- "We don't have the personnel to write this up"
- "Here are the keys to our document warehouse - look for yourself"

**Why this works:**
- Technically, she's providing access (not hiding anything)
- Burden is on Buyer to find the problem in millions of documents
- If Buyer misses something, Carol can say "I gave you access, you should have looked"

**Theme:** #EXAM_SIGNAL Refusing to provide targeted information while offering "full access" creates due diligence burdens that can hide material problems. Be paranoid about such offers.

## 6. Third-Party Experts

### A. Accountants

**Role:** Verify financial statements, assess quality of earnings, review tax compliance, provide "comfort letters" about financial condition.

### B. Investment bankers and fairness opinions

**Role:** Value the company using various methodologies (comparable companies, DCF, precedent transactions), advise on deal structure, arrange financing.

**Fairness opinion:** Formal assessment that the deal price is "fair" from a financial perspective. Purpose is to protect directors from liability for selling too cheaply or paying too much.

### C. Lawyers and legal opinions

**Role:** Provide opinions on corporate validity, authorization, good standing, contract enforceability, IP ownership, litigation status.

**Purpose:** Allocate risk - if lawyer's opinion is wrong and lawyer was negligent, lawyer may be liable.

### D. The expert incentive problem

**Temptation to overstate:**
- Paid by the client, so incentive to please
- Want future business from the client
- Everyone wants the deal to close

**What stops them:**
- Legal liability (malpractice, gatekeeper liability)
- Professional standards and regulation
- Reputational risk (if known for "easy" opinions, their opinions become less valuable)
- Internal firm processes (independent review of opinions)

**Theme:** #EXAM_SIGNAL Third-party experts provide verification but face client-pleasing incentives. Their credibility depends on reputation and professional discipline, which creates long-term incentives for honesty.

---

## 7. Contingent Payments and Risk Allocation

### A. Ben Buyer and Sue Seller - zoning approval

**The problem:** Ben will pay $10M if zoning approved, only $7M if not. Zoning process takes time. Sue needs money now.

**Solution:** Contingent payment structure
- Ben pays $7M now (certain value)
- Additional $3M paid IF zoning approved
- Sue gets certainty; Ben gets upside if zoning succeeds
- This shifts risk to Sue (who owns the land)

**Theme:** #EXAM_SIGNAL When information is uncertain or costly to obtain, the solution is often allocating risk to the party best positioned to bear it through contingent payments.

---

## Professor's Key Framings and Formulations

1. **"Please do be paranoid"** - The baseline for transactional practice. Don't take explanations at face value.

2. **"Sellers have the incentive to SEEM truthful, not BE truthful"** - The critical distinction between appearance and reality in negotiations.

3. **"Silence is protection. But once you speak, it has to be accurate"** - The legal rule that you can refuse to answer but can't lie.

4. **"Due diligence looks like a game of Battleship"** - You ask lots of questions to find where the problems are, then focus your investigation there.

5. **"It takes a lifetime to build a reputation and 5 minutes to destroy it"** - The long-term value of actually being truthful, not just seeming truthful.

6. **"Good news, it's an asset deal, so it won't be as hard"** - Asset deals involve lighter due diligence because liabilities don't transfer.

## Thematic Sentences for Exam Review

**Stock Deals vs. Asset Deals:** The choice between stock and asset deals is fundamentally about risk allocation. Stock deals preserve the business and its contracts but bring all liabilities. Asset deals let you leave liabilities behind but may lose favorable contracts and require third-party consents. When choosing structure, ask: what risks do I want to acquire, and what relationships do I need to preserve?

**Information Asymmetry:** Due diligence exists because sellers know more than buyers. The law of acquisitions (representations & warranties, opinions, diligence review) is essentially a system for producing and verifying information at the lowest possible cost. But information production itself is strategic - parties may withhold information for legitimate reasons or as a pretext to hide bad news.

**The Disclosure Incentive Problem:** Sellers have incentives to share bad news as well as good news because silence triggers worst-case assumptions. But this incentive breaks down when sellers can offer plausible alternative explanations for withholding. The buyer's challenge is distinguishing between legitimate refusals (competitive harm, proprietary costs) and strategic hiding.

**Third-Party Verification:** Accountants, investment bankers, and lawyers provide verification but face conflicting incentives to please their clients. Their credibility depends on reputation and professional discipline, which aligns their long-term interests with honesty even when short-term incentives favor pleasing the client.

**Risk Allocation as Fallback:** When information is too costly to produce or verify, the solution is allocating risk through contingent payments, escrows, representations & warranties, and other contractual mechanisms. The party with better information often bears the risk.
