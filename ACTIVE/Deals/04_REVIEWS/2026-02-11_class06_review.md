**Course:** Deals

**Prep Sheet Used:** Class 5 (Note: Class was behind schedule)

---

## 1. Prep vs. Reality Comparison

**Expectation vs. Reality:**
- **Scheduled Topic:** Spinoffs, Tax Attributes, and NOL Carrybacks (Class 6 Prep).
- **Actual Coverage:** Corporate Acquisitions, Reps/Warranties/Covenants/Conditions, Materiality, and MAC Clauses (Class 5 Prep).
- **Status:** The class is effectively one session behind the syllabus/prep schedule. The discussion focused entirely on the mechanics of acquisition agreements and risk allocation, specifically using the **Grumman bus case** (due diligence/reps), **Ann/Ben lease** (pandemic renegotiation), and **L Brands/Victoria's Secret** (MAC clauses/Ordinary Course).

**Core Topics Covered:**
1.  **Due Diligence & Information Asymmetry:** Continuing the discussion on why sellers might withhold information (bad news vs. proprietary info).
2.  **Contractual mechanisms:** Differentiating Representations (facts as of signing), Covenants (promises between signing/closing), and Conditions (requirements to close).
3.  **Qualifiers:** The strategic use of "Material" (and aggregation issues) and "To the best of my knowledge" (appropriate for threatened litigation, not for verifiable facts like title).
4.  **"As Is" vs. Good Faith:** The strict U.S. approach to "a deal is a deal" versus jurisdictions with implied duties of good faith.
5.  **Pandemic Stress Testing:** How "Ordinary Course" covenants and MAC clauses functioned (or failed) during COVID-19.

## 2. Exam Signals & Professor Emphasis

- **#EXAM_SIGNAL - Definitions Matter:** The professor spent significant time ensuring clear distinctions between Reps, Covenants, and Conditions. *Knowing which is which and their specific function (damages vs. walking away) is critical.*
- **#EXAM_SIGNAL - "Information Forcing Rules":** The professor emphasized that strict contract enforcement (like in the bus case) forces buyers to ask the right questions. *Argument: Strictness isn't just "mean," it incentivizes better due diligence.*
- **#EXAM_SIGNAL - "Ordinary Course" Context:** In the Victoria's Secret discussion, the professor emphasized that "ordinary course" is context-dependent. Furloughing employees during a pandemic *was* the responsible (and thus "ordinary" in context) thing to do, even if it deviated from past practice.
- **#EXAM_SIGNAL - Materiality Aggregation:** The "dog catcher tax" example and the $500 threshold question highlighted the specific danger of "death by a thousand cuts" if materiality isn't defined with an aggregate cap.

## 3. Corrections to Prep

- **Prep Match:** The content covered matched the Class 5 Prep sheet perfectly.
- **Scheduling Note:** Class 6 Prep (Spinoffs/NOLs) was **NOT** covered and should be preserved for the next class review.

## 4. Doctrinal Insights

### A. Reps vs. Covenants vs. Conditions
- **Representations:** Statements of fact true **as of a specific moment** (usually Signing Date). Function: Information production.
- **Covenants:** Promises to take action (or refrain) **over a period of time** (between Signing and Closing). Function: Behavior control.
- **Conditions:** Requirements that must be met **as of the Closing Date** for the deal to proceed. Function: Risk allocation (exit ramp).
    - *Nuance:* A breach of a covenant (like "Ordinary Course") can *become* a failure of a condition if the contract makes compliance a condition of closing.

### B. "To the Best of My Knowledge"
- **When REASONABLE:** For things the seller **cannot control** or definitively know, such as *threatened* litigation (predictions of others' behavior).
- **When UNREASONABLE:** For objectively verifiable facts the seller **should** know, such as land ownership (title registration).
    - *Professor's Take:* A seller claiming ignorance on title is effectively saying "I was too lazy to check," which shouldn't protect them.

### C. The "Ordinary Course" Covenant
- **Purpose:** Prevents moral hazard between signing and closing. Seller shouldn't loot the company or change its fundamental nature before handing it over.
- **Pandemic Interpretation (L Brands/Sycamore):**
    - **Buyer's argument:** You closed stores and furloughed staff; that's not "past practice."
    - **Seller's argument:** The "business" is retail; operating a retail business *during a pandemic* requires closing stores. Acting "ordinarily" means acting *responsibly* under current conditions.
    - **Outcome:** The buyer often uses these technical breaches to exit a deal they arguably just regret (Buyer's Remorse/MAC arbitrage).

## 5. Policy Arguments

### Strict Enforcement vs. Paternalism
- **Argument for Strictness (US Approach):** "A deal is a deal."
    - **Incentive:** Forces sophisticated parties to do their own diligence (Information Forcing).
    - **Freedom of Contract:** Allows parties to price in risk. If a seller wants to sell "as is" for a 33% discount, and a buyer accepts, a court enforcing "good faith" warranties effectively **prohibits** this mutually beneficial transaction.
    - **Anti-Paternalism:** Courts shouldn't rewrite deals for sophisticated entities (Grumman was a big boy; they messed up).

### Relational Theory (The Shopping Mall Lease)
- **Concept:** Strict enforcement (eviction) might be legally sound but economically suicidal.
- **Application:** Forgiving rent/keeping the tenant (Ben) during the pandemic was better than having an empty space.
- **Insight:** Contracts exist in a market context. If *no one* can pay rent, enforcing the lease against the *current* tenant just leaves you with no tenant.

## 6. Outline Inserts

### [Insert: Reps, Covenants, Conditions]
> **Reps:** Fact snapshots (Signing). Remedy: Damages (Indemnity).
> **Covenants:** Action promises (Signing -> Closing). Remedy: Damages/Specific Performance.
> **Conditions:** Go/No-Go gates (Closing). Remedy: Walk away.

### [Insert: Materiality Qualifiers]
> **Individual vs. Aggregate:** Defining materiality solely by individual item size (e.g., <$500) exposes the buyer to "death by a thousand cuts." *Must* include an aggregate cap (basket) to catch cumulative non-material breaches.

### [Insert: Knowledge Qualifiers]
> **Rule of Thumb:**
> - **Verifiable Facts (Title, Pending Suits):** strict liability (no knowledge qualifier). Seller is cheapest cost avoider/best information provider.
> - **Predictive/Third-Party Facts (Threatened Suits):** "Best of knowledge" is acceptable. Seller cannot control or read minds of third parties.

## 7. Source Extraction

- **Grumman v. Flexible (The Bus Case):**
    - **Facts:** Buyer (Grumman) bought startup; bus frames cracked; sued for non-disclosure. Contract said "As Is" / "No reliance."
    - **Holding:** Seller wins. Buyer was sophisticated and failed to ask the right questions. Court won't rewrite the deal.
    - **Principle:** Sophisticated parties are held to the strict letter of their "As Is" bargains.

- **L Brands / Sycamore Partners (Victoria's Secret):**
    - **Facts:** Buyer tried to exit via "Ordinary Course" breach (furloughs/store closures) because MAC clause carved out "Pandemics."
    - **Context:** Deal arbitrage. Buyer wanted out because the value dropped, used technical covenants as the escape hatch.
    - **Lesson:** Covenants can function as "backdoor" MAC clauses if not carefully drafted to account for emergency responses.
