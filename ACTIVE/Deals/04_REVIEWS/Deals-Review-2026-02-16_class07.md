# Deals Class Review 2026-02-16

**Date**: 2026-02-16
**Class**: Class 7 (Covering Class 5 & Intro Class 6 Content)
**Topic**: MAC Clauses, M&A Incentives, & Intro to Regulatory Arbitrage (NOLs)
**Transcript**: `ACTIVE/Deals/03_TRANSCRIPTS/raw/Deals-transcript-02-16.txt`

## 1. PREP VS. REALITY COMPARISON

- **Schedule Shift**: Due to a missed snow day, this class covered the **M&A/MAC Clause** material (originally Class 5) and introduced **Regulatory Arbitrage/NOLs** (originally Class 6). The scheduled **Venture Capital** material (Class 7) was POSTPONED to the next class.
- **Emphasis Difference**:
  - The prep focused on the *legal* distinction between Reps/Warranties/Conditions.
  - The class focused heavily on the **economic/incentive rationales** for these clauses (Symmetry Rationale vs. Investment Rationale).
- **Missed in Prep**: The "Debt Covenant" workaround (using debt covenants as a back-door MAC) was a key practical point in class that wasn't prominent in the prep.

## 2. EXAM SIGNALS (#EXAM_SIGNAL)

- **#EXAM_SIGNAL Comparison Sets**: Schizer emphasized the ambiguity in "disproportionate effect" clauses.
  > "What is the benchmark? What is the comparison set?... Airlines with only international routes... or just airlines?"
  > *Expect an exam question where the outcome turns on how you define the "peer group".*
- **#EXAM_SIGNAL Debt Covenants**: Schizer highlighted that buyers can use **Debt Covenants** (cross-defaults) to renegotiate even if a MAC clause fails.
  > "This is a way to simulate a material adverse change clause without actually using it."
- **#EXAM_SIGNAL Tax Deduction Value**: Schizer explicitly walked through the math of a deduction's value ($1 deduction = $1 * Tax Rate).
  > "The economic value of a deduction depends on the taxpayer's tax rate." *Know this formula.*

## 3. CORRECTIONS TO PREP

- **MAC Clause Purpose**: The prep listed "Risk Allocation" as the primary function. Schizer refined this into two specific incentive problems:
  1.  **Symmetry Rationale**: Encourages buyers to bid by neutralizing seller's option value (Shareholder vote asymmetry).
  2.  **Investment Rationale**: Solves "Moral Hazard" / "Agency Cost" of seller management slacking off between signing and closing. Schizer prefers this explanation.
- **Ordinary Course & Crisis**: The prep suggested "force majeure" might excuse breaches. Schizer clarified that in the *Limited/Victoria's Secret* case, they breached the "Ordinary Course" covenant by closing stores/firing staff *without consent*, even if it was the "right" business decision. The breach was the **failure to ask**, not the action itself.

## 4. DOCTRINAL INSIGHTS

### MAC Clause Architecture
The standard MAC clause has three layers:
1.  **Base Definition**: "Any event materially adverse..." (Extremely broad, covers almost everything).
2.  **Carve-Outs**: "EXCEPT changes in general economy, industry, law..." (Allocates systemic risk to Buyer).
3.  **Carve-Out to the Carve-Out**: "...UNLESS it affects Target **disproportionately** relative to peers." (Allocates firm-specific risk to Seller).

### The "Symmetry Rationale" for MACs
- **Problem**: Seller shareholders have an option. If deal value ^, they vote NO (or renegotiate). If deal value v, they vote YES (lock it in). Buyer loses either way.
- **Solution**: MAC clause gives Buyer a matching option to walk away if things go wrong, "leveling the playing field" to encourage bidding.

### The "Investment Rationale" for MACs
- **Problem**: Between signing and closing, Seller management is a "lame duck" (Agency Cost). If they slack off, Buyer pays the price (Moral Hazard).
- **Solution**: MAC clause (specifically the "disproportionate effect" prong) forces Seller to perform at least as well as peers to keep the deal alive.

## 5. POLICY ARGUMENTS & "THE THREE CORE PROBLEMS"

**1. Information Problem**
- *Asymmetry*: Seller knows firm-specific risks; Buyer knows general market risks.
- *Mechanism*: Reps & Warranties force Seller to disclose specific facts (Info Production).

**2. Agency Problem**
- *Conflict*: Seller management (Agent) vs. Buyer (Principal during pendency).
- *Mechanism*: "Ordinary Course" covenants and MAC clauses prevent management from shirking or taking excessive risks before closing.

**3. Commitment Problem**
- *Conflict*: Seller shareholders can't credibly commit *not* to vote down a deal if a better one appears (or value spikes).
- *Mechanism*: Break-up fees (not discussed today but implied) or MAC clauses to give Buyer counter-leverage.

## 6. OUTLINE INSERTS

### Economic Value of a Deduction
$$ \text{Value} = \text{Deduction Amount} \times \text{Marginal Tax Rate} $$
- **$1 Deduction @ 21% Rate** = $0.21 savings.
- **$1 Deduction @ 35% Rate** = $0.35 savings.
- *Strategic Implication*: Deductions are worth MORE to high-tax taxpayers (or in high-tax years).

### Regulatory Arbitrage: Carrybacks vs. Carryforwards
- **Carryforward**: Save loss for future year (Time Value of Money loss).
- **Carryback**: Apply loss to past year (Immediate cash refund).
- **Arbitrage Opportunity**: If past tax rate (e.g., 35% pre-2018) was higher than current rate (21%), a carryback is "super-charged"—you get back 35c on the dollar today for a loss that would only save you 21c tomorrow.

## 7. SOURCE EXTRACTION

- **Cases Discussed**:
  - *The Limited / Sycamore Partners (Victoria's Secret)*: Illustrates "Ordinary Course" breach during pandemic.
  - *LVMH / Tiffany*: Illustrates using **Debt Covenants** / Debt Multiples to force price renegotiation when MAC is unclear.
- **Statutes**:
  - **CARES Act (2020)**: Re-allowed NOL carrybacks (5 years back) for 2018-2020 losses.

## 8. PREWRITE OPPORTUNITIES

**Topic: MAC Clause Analysis**
*   **Trigger**: Fact pattern involving a sudden market shock (pandemic, war, crash).
*   **Analysis Structure**:
    1.  **General Rule**: Buyer bears systemic risk; Seller bears firm-specific risk.
    2.  **Step 1: Impact**: Is it a MAC? (Usually yes, heavily adverse).
    3.  **Step 2: Carve-Out**: Is it a general market/industry event? (If yes, Buyer stays in).
    4.  **Step 3: Disproportionate Effect**: Is Target doing worse than "peers"?
        - *Argue for Buyer*: Compare to broad industry (Target looks bad).
        - *Argue for Seller*: Compare to specific niche (Everyone looks bad).
    5.  **Policy Check**: Does holding Seller to the deal create "Moral Hazard"? (Did they slack off?)

## 9. TRANSCRIPT QC FLAGS

- **Speaker ID**: "Mr. I played the ropes" -> Likely a student name (Alexander? Ariel?).
- **Unclear Phrasing**: "Matt Clause" -> "MAC Clause" (recurring typo).
- **Unclear Phrasing**: "Panel 1" / "Panel 3" references seem consistent with turn-taking.

**Next Class Prep**:
- **Subject**: Venture Capital (Ellen/Schoolco/Pensionco problem).
- **Key Concepts**: Staged Financing, Real Options, Signaling.
