# Review — Class #1 — 2026-01-21 — Introduction to Information and Incentive Problems

---

## 1. What Professor Emphasized (3-5 main points)

1. Transactional lawyering adds value by solving trust problems (information + incentives) that otherwise kill value-creating deals. #EXAM_SIGNAL
2. The course is not “a body of law” survey; it’s a cross-context toolkit for diagnosing problems and designing mechanisms. #EXAM_SIGNAL
3. Core diagnostic triad: uncertainty, information asymmetry, and agency costs (reappears across used cars, homes, M&A, compensation). #EXAM_SIGNAL
4. Mechanisms are the lawyer’s tools (questions in writing; due diligence; third-party verification; contingent price/earn-outs; incentives). #EXAM_SIGNAL
5. Second theme preview: regulatory arbitrage (category-driven legal advantage), with tax planning as the recurring case study. #EXAM_SIGNAL

---

## 2. Exam Signals #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Explicit signals:**
- [ ] “The major theme… is these incentive and information problems and you have to figure out how to solve them.” #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] “The other theme… is… steering clients in the more favorable category” (regulatory arbitrage). #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Implicit signals:**
- [ ] Every fact pattern should be translated into (1) what is unknown, (2) who knows it, (3) who acts for whom, and (4) what mechanism changes behavior or reveals information. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Agency problems are not just “waste”; they include risk-taking incentives and compensation structures (stock/options indexing). #EXAM_SIGNAL

## 3. Corrections to Prep

**My prep said:** (No course-standard prep doc existed.) The Class 1 prep sheet framed the day as an introduction to uncertainty, information asymmetry, and agency costs with basic mechanisms (reps/warranties, due diligence, contingent price).
**Prof clarified:** Same core concepts, but he pushed a stronger claim about lawyering as value-creation (not social waste) and expanded agency into executive compensation design (conventional vs indexed options).
**Fix:** Build an “engineering” outline: (problem → mechanism → tradeoffs) for each example.

**My prediction:** The day would stay in used car / house / business examples.
**Actually emphasized:** Those examples + a full worked compensation module (options indexing) and a preview of regulatory arbitrage (tax).
**Lesson:** Track mechanisms with concrete inputs/outputs: what the mechanism forces parties to reveal, and how it reallocates risk.

---

## 4. Doctrinal Insights

**New understanding:**
- The “basic unit” of analysis is a deal that could create value but fails because parties can’t credibly share information or align incentives.
- Compensation design is a live instance of agency costs: paying for absolute performance can misfire when the market moves; indexing can better target firm-specific performance.

**Statutory/professor moves:**
- Category mismatches are predictable and ubiquitous: legal systems inevitably treat similar things differently; lawyers create value by choosing the favorable category (tax planning as exemplar).

---

## 5. Policy Arguments

**Strong arguments prof rewarded:**
- Strong legal systems correlate with economic growth because they enable value-creating transactions at scale (lawyers are not “waste”).
- Risk allocation should follow comparative advantage: the party who can diversify/insure at lower cost should bear the risk (arena owner vs individual ticket buyer analogy).

**Strong critiques prof anticipated:**
- Third-party experts can have conflicts (accountants/bankers “brother-in-law” problem; incentives inside verification).
- Seemingly “standard” mechanisms (conventional options) can be systematically miscalibrated.

**Exam-ready policy paragraphs:**
- **Transaction value thesis:** Deal terms are not formalities; they are governance devices that make cooperation possible under distrust.
- **Agency thesis:** Incentive design must reward relative performance (or at least avoid paying for market-wide tides) if the goal is firm-specific value creation.

## 6. Outline Inserts (copy-ready)

> Paste-ready blocks to add into `05_OUTLINE/` without rewriting.

### Insert: Deals Framework — Diagnose → Mechanize

```markdown
For any transaction:
1) **Uncertainty:** What future state matters? Who bears it?
2) **Information asymmetry:** Who knows what (seller/buyer; insiders/outsiders)?
3) **Agency costs:** Who decides? Whose interests diverge?
4) **Mechanisms:** Due diligence; reps/warranties; indemnity; third-party verification; contingent price/earn-out; governance/compensation.
5) **Tradeoffs:** Cost, conflict, moral hazard, adverse selection, enforcement.

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: Agency Costs — Indexed Options (Motivation)

```markdown
**Problem:** Conventional options can overpay CEO for underperforming the market and underpay for outperforming it.
**Fix (conceptual):** Index option strike to an external benchmark (S&P 500 or industry index) to reward firm-specific outperformance.
**Constraint:** Benchmark choice (industry comparables; diversified firms).

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: Minor Theme — Regulatory Arbitrage

```markdown
Legal systems categorize imperfectly; similar transactions get different legal treatment.
Lawyer value-add: structure facts/terms to fall into the favorable category (tax planning as recurring case study).

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

## 8. Prewrite Opportunities

> Potential exam questions arising from this lecture. Flag for `06_PREWRITES/`.

### Doctrinal Prewrites Identified

| ☐ | Doctrine | Question Type | Prof's Framework | Priority |
|---|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| ☐ | Uncertainty / info asymmetry / agency costs toolkit | Issue-spotter | Diagnose → mechanism → tradeoff | High |

### Policy Prewrites Identified

| ☐ | Topic | Question Type | Prof's Angle | Priority |
|---|-------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| ☐ | Lawyers as value creators vs “waste” | Policy essay | Deals enable cooperation under distrust | Medium |
| ☐ | Indexed vs conventional options | Policy essay | Paying for relative performance | Medium |

### Prewrite Fragment (if ready to extract now)

**Doctrine:** Deal mechanism selection
**Trigger:** Any transactional hypo with distrust
**IRAC Starter:**
> **Issue** How should parties structure terms to overcome uncertainty, information asymmetry, and agency costs?
> **Rule/Frame** Identify the information/incentive failure and select a mechanism that either forces disclosure (due diligence/reps) or aligns incentives (contingent price/compensation/governance).
> **Application template** Explain what the mechanism changes (information revealed; risk allocation; behavior incentives) and name the tradeoffs (cost; moral hazard; verification conflicts).

## 9. Transcript QC

> Flag any transcript accuracy issues for correction.

**Verification status:** ⚠️ Issues Found

### Errors Detected

| Flag | Section | Issue | Suggested Correction |
|------|---------|-------|---------------------|
| #TRANSCRIPT_VERIFY | Professor name | “David Shizzer” | David Schizer |
| #TRANSCRIPT_VERIFY | Term | “regulatory arbitross” | regulatory arbitrage |

**Common legal term corrections applied:**
- “fairness opinion” (bankers) → leave as-is (term of art)

## 10. Spaced Reinforcement (10–15 minutes later)

**Self-quiz prompts (closed-book):**

1. Define the course’s “major theme” and give one example.
2. List the diagnostic triad and give one mechanism for each problem type.
3. Explain why conventional stock options can mis-incentivize CEOs in a rising or falling market.
4. State the idea of regulatory arbitrage in one sentence.
5. For the used-car hypo: name one disclosure mechanism and one incentive mechanism, and identify a tradeoff for each.

## METRICS

**Prediction accuracy:** {metrics.prediction_accuracy} (0=missed, 1=partial, 2=accurate)
**Time spent:** {metrics.time_spent_minutes} minutes
**Exam signals found:** {metrics.signal_count}
**Sources extracted:** {metrics.sources_count}
**Prewrite opportunities:** {metrics.prewrite_count}

**What to prep differently next time:**
- For each problem set, force a mapping: problem → mechanism → tradeoff.
- Track benchmark choice whenever a “relative performance” mechanism is proposed.
