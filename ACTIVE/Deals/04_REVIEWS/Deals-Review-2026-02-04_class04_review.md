# Review — Class #4 — 2026-02-04 — Residential Real Property - Tax Planning, Contract Drafting, and M&A Introduction

---

## 1. Prep vs. Reality Comparison

The class covered the prep material comprehensively, focusing on tax planning in real estate transactions and extending to M&A basics. The discussion flowed from real estate due diligence and contract drafting to tax allocation strategies and then to business acquisitions.

Key alignment:
- Same tax planning examples (mansion tax, sales tax, property tax trade-offs)
- Same contract drafting issues (punch list, CO, mortgage contingency, shed permit)
- Same M&A introduction (vertical integration, make-or-buy decisions)

The class went beyond the prep by adding M&A context, showing how the same information/incentive problems apply across different transaction types.

## 2. Exam Signals

**Explicit signals:**
- Regulatory arbitrage applies to tax planning: same economics, different tax treatment. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- Tax planning requires analyzing all parties and considering frictions. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- Vertical integration solves incentive problems when contracts can't specify quality. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- Make-or-buy decisions depend on ability to write enforceable contracts. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- Information asymmetry affects all transactions, from houses to businesses. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- Reputation and repeat relationships can substitute for formal contracts. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- Contract language must be specific and objective to be enforceable. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- Escrow/holdbacks address timing issues in due diligence. #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Implicit signals:**
- Transactional lawyers add value by designing structures that minimize total costs. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- Bargaining power is not the answer; find principled reasons for demands. #EXAM_SIGNAL

## 3. Corrections to Prep

No major corrections. The prep was accurate and comprehensive.

Minor additions from class:
- Contract drafting requires careful reading to avoid tautological language.
- Mortgage contingencies have real economic value for sellers.
- M&A can be motivated by vertical integration to solve quality control issues.

---

## 4. Doctrinal Insights

**Tax Planning Framework:**
- Allocation of purchase price affects multiple taxes (mansion, sales, property)
- Trade-offs depend on holding period and tax rates
- All parties analysis crucial for net benefits

**Contract Drafting:**
- Representations must survive closing with remedies
- Escrow protects against post-closing issues
- Mortgage contingencies protect buyers but cost sellers

**M&A Basics:**
- Vertical integration addresses information/incentive problems
- Make-or-buy decisions when contracts fail
- Reputation substitutes for formal enforcement

**Professor's preferred framing:** All transactions involve the same core problems; lawyers solve them through different mechanisms depending on context.

---

## 5. Policy Arguments

Professor emphasized economic efficiency:
- Tax systems create arbitrage opportunities that lawyers exploit
- Vertical integration efficient when contracts can't specify quality
- Information disclosure requirements balance buyer protection with transaction costs

Arguments that landed well: Practical contract drafting, tax allocation trade-offs.

Arguments that fell flat: None apparent.

## 6. Outline Inserts

**Tax Planning in Transactions**
Tax planning involves structuring economically similar arrangements to achieve different tax outcomes. Key levers include:

1. **Allocation**: Dividing purchase price between real and personal property affects mansion tax, sales tax, and property tax
2. **Timing**: Deferral through escrow or delayed invoicing reduces present value of tax burden
3. **All Parties Analysis**: Tax benefits to one party may create costs to another; net analysis required

**Contract Drafting Principles**
Effective contracts address information asymmetry through:
- Specific, objective performance standards
- Survival of representations beyond closing
- Escrow/holdbacks for contingent obligations
- Remedies tied to verification mechanisms

**M&A Transaction Design**
M&A addresses information and incentive problems through:
- Vertical integration when quality can't be contracted for
- Due diligence to reduce information gaps
- Contingent purchase prices for post-closing discoveries

## 7. Source Extraction

No new cases, statutes, or readings mentioned.

## 8. Prewrite Opportunities

**Tax Allocation Prewrite**
Topic: Purchase price allocation in real estate transactions
Issue: When should buyers allocate purchase price to minimize total tax burden?
Rule: Compare mansion tax savings vs. property tax increases over expected holding period
Application: House purchase with personal property inclusion
Conclusion: Allocate based on holding period and tax rate differentials

**Contract Drafting Prewrite**
Topic: Effective contract provisions for real estate transactions
Issue: What contract language best protects buyers from post-closing issues?
Rule: Specific obligations + verification rights + escrow remedies
Application: Punch list repairs and certificate of occupancy requirements
Conclusion: Contracts must provide enforceable remedies, not just promises
