2. **POLICY** - Policy arguments for economic justifications

## How Prewrites Work

**Before exam:**
1. Identify frequently tested problems (from past exams)
2. Create frameworks for common problem types
3. Create policy justifications for major themes

**During exam:**
1. Identify problem type in fact pattern
2. Copy relevant framework
3. Customize to facts
4. Add specific economic analysis

**After exam:**
1. Note which frameworks were useful
2. Update based on what was tested
3. Refine for next iteration

## Building Prewrites

**Source material:**
- Prep sheets (economic analysis)
- Review documents (key concepts)
- Past exams (what gets tested)
- Case studies (illustrative examples)

**Process:**
1. Start with template from `law-school-common/03_TEMPLATES/`
2. Identify core problem type
3. Design analytical framework
4. Test on 2-3 hypotheticals
5. Refine based on practice

## Tracking

**In MASTER_LOG.md:**
- `Doctrinal?` column - ✅ if framework exists for problem type
- `Policy?` column - ✅ if policy prewrite exists for theme

**Update as prewrites are created:**
- Mark column as ✅ when prewrite complete
- Note which topics have prewrites
