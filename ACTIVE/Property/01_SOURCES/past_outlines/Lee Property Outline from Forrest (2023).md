# [**Ways** **to** **Acquire** **Property**]{.underline}

> **First** **Possession**-first come, first serve; the person who gets
> the thing first owns it

### [Wild animals]{.underline}

a.  **Pierson** **v.** **Post** **(1805)**

    i.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Post is fox hunting, sees a fox, starts
        chasing it; Pierson intervened and killed the fox to prevent
        Post from getting it; Post sued Pierson

    ii. **[Question:]{.underline}** what constitutes possession for wild
        animals?

    iii. **[Holding:]{.underline}** Post did not have ownership of the
         fox; if you're the first to possess the animal in the
         wilderness, it's yours

    iv. [**Majority** **Test:**]{.underline} the pursuer is deemed to
        have possession of a wild animal if he satisfies all three of
        these conditions

        1.  Manifest an unequivocal intention of appropriating the
            animal to his individual use;

        2.  He has deprived the animal of its natural liberty; and

        3.  **He** **has** **brought** **the** **animal** **within**
            **his** **certain** **control**

    v.  [**For** **Hunters:**]{.underline} pursuer mortally wounds the
        animal and does not abandon pursuit

    vi. [**For** **Trappers:**]{.underline} via nets or other traps,
        captures the animal and renders escape impossible

    vii. **[Rationale:]{.underline}** in allocating ownership of the
         fox, the majority was motivated by preservation of peace and
         order in society; for the sake of certainty; to avoid quarrels
         and litigation

    viii. [**Dissent** **test:**]{.underline} property and wild animals
          can be acquired without physically grabbing the thing; if the
          pursuer has shown that he intends to convert the animal, AND
          either

> \(a\) the animal is within reach of the pursuer or (b) the pursuer has
> a reasonable prospect of taking it

ix. [**Dissent** **motivation:**]{.underline} thought that allowing
    Pierson to get away with killing the fox would discourage other
    hunters; foxes are seen as pests, so discouraging other hunters
    would prevent pests from being eradicated

    1.  Refrain from asking legal scholars, default rather to sportsmen
        because they know the rules from real- life experiences

<!-- -->

b.  **Ghen** **v.** **Rich** **(1881)-**role of custom

    i.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** whaling; Ghen killed a whale; custom
        was that when the whale was washed ashore, the finder would call
        into town and contact the killer of the whale based on
        distinctive markings; Ellis found the whale and sold it to Rich;
        Ghen sued Rich

    ii. **[Question:]{.underline}** who did the whale belong to?

    iii. [**Pierson** **Majority** **Test** **Application** **(NOT**
         **APPLIED**]{.underline} **[HERE):]{.underline}** it can be
         argued that Ghen abandoned pursuit, but that isn't so obvious

    iv. [**Pierson** **Minority** **Test** **Application** **(NOT**
        **APPLIED**]{.underline} **[HERE):]{.underline}** was the whale
        within reach or was there reasonable prospect? Test probably
        fails too

    v.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** Ghen owns the whale

    vi. **[Rationale:]{.underline}** custom on usage prevails

        1.  Custom is consistent with other case law

        2.  Long acquiescence to the rule and it works well in practice

        3.  Having the custom is necessary if the industry is to
            continue

        4.  Whalers wouldn't be incentivized to whale if they weren't
            able to have the whale they kill when someone else finds it

<!-- -->

II. **Tragedy** **of** **the** **commons**---overutilization of a
    resource

    a.  Problems associated with an open-access resource in which there
        is an unrestricted privilege to capture some valued feature

    b.  Incentive to get there first but no incentive to replace

    c.  [Example:]{.underline} herders are inclined to add more and more
        cattle to a pasture because they receive a direct benefit of
        their own animal and bear only a share of the costs resulting
        from overgrazing

        i.  Each man is locked into a system that compels him to
            increase his herd without limit, in a world that is limited

    d.  Overcoming the problem requires realignment of rights, which
        requires dealing with holdouts and free riders

    e.  Alternatives to having a common

        i.  Private property being imposed on all common-owned property

            1.  People will now be competing against nature as opposed
                to each other

            2.  Private property allows ranches to internalize the
                benefits of their investment and requires them to
                internalize the costs of their consumption

            3.  Risk mitigation measures: insurance and markets

## **Water** **Rights**

I.  Water in defined body vs. diffuse water

    a.  **Water** **in** **defined** **body**-treated as a valuable
        resource

    b.  **Diffuse** **water**-treated as a pest to be eradicated

II. **Riparian** **owner**-someone whose land abuts a watercourse;
    whoever owns the land owns the riparian rights

III. Principles governing water rights

     a.  **Natural** **flow** **approach** **(not** **favored** **in**
         **US)**-you're allowed to remove water from a watercourse only
         to the extent that you don't disrupt the natural flow of the
         water

         i.  **Principle:** a just allocation of property rights is one
             in which everyone is entitled to exactly the same amount

         ii. **Exception:** you could use more than the natural flow if
             you get the permission of everyone downstream of you

         iii. **Problem:** prevents a lot of beneficial uses of the
              water

     b.  **Reasonable** **use** **approach**-you can make use of as much
         water as is reasonable; allows for more productive activity
         than natural flow approach

         i.  **Principle:** a just allocation of property rights is one
             that promotes allocation of resources to socially valuable
             uses, where a court decides how valuable or reasonable your
             use is

         ii. **Problem:** what uses are reasonable?

     c.  **First** **appropriation** **approach**-if you get the water
         first, it's yours

         i.  **Principle:** a just allocation of property rights is one
             that promotes economic development by rewarding initiative
             and promoting certainty

         ii. **Problem:** it may not always be obvious as to who was
             first

     d.  **Correlative** **rights** **approach**-the scope of your
         rights to a particular resource might depend on the scope of
         your rights to another resource

         i.  **Principle:** a just allocation of property rights is one
             that depends on the scope of your rights to another
             resource

         ii. **Example:** ad coelum rule---have right to the air above
             the surface and the minerals below the surface by virtue of
             the fact that you own the surface

IV. **Evans** **v.** **Merriweather** **(1842)**-reasonable use approach

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Smith and Baker owned land and built a
        steam mill; Evans bought land upstream of S&B and built a steam
        mill; S&B sold land to Merriweather; there was a drought so not
        enough water in the watercourse; Evans constructed a dam to
        capture and use all the water from the stream; Merriweather sued
        Evans

    b.  [**Possible** **Outcomes:**]{.underline}

        i.  Smith and Baker were first to use the water, so that use
            transfers to MerriweatherREJECTED

        ii. Natural flow approachREJECTED, too economically straining

        iii. Reasonable use, where each owner has a right to use the
             water only as long as the use is reasonable and doesn't
             injure anyone more than necessaryACCEPTED

    c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** Merriweather wins out; Evans' use was
        not a natural or reasonable use

    d.  [**General** **Rule:**]{.underline} riparian owners are entitled
        to use water only to the extent that the use is both (1)
        reasonable, and (2) not more injurious than necessary to
        accomplish the use

    e.  [**Natural** **Uses** **vs.** **Artificial**
        **Uses:**]{.underline} natural uses, absolute necessities,
        always take priority; artificial uses increase
        comfort/prosperity

V.  **Coffin** **v.** **Left** **Hand** **Ditch** **Company**
    **(1882)**-first appropriation approach

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** plaintiff diverting water from the
        stream for use for irrigation; defendant Coffin acquired land
        downstream of plaintiff and starts diverting water from the
        stream for irrigation; there was a drought, and defendant made
        breach in plaintiff's dam to allow water to flow through; both
        lands ended up suffering; plaintiff sued defendant for dam
        breach

    b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** plaintiff wins out, the defendant
        should not have breached the dam

    c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** the right to water by first
        appropriation

        i.  Existed from the time of the first appropriations in
            Colorado

        ii. Public policy in Colorado has encouraged the diversion and
            use of water for agriculture

        iii. Certainty and predictability are valuable to the court

        iv. Imperative necessity requires that Colorado not follow
            reasonable use approach

    d.  **[Rule:]{.underline}** the first appropriator of water from a
        natural stream for a beneficial purpose has a prior right
        thereto to the **extent** **of**

> **such** **appropriation** (can't go in and add or extend your usage;
> can't keep making changes)
>
> **The** ***Ad*** ***Coelum*** **Rule**-if you own surface land, you
> own the land as far down as the core of the earth and as far up as the
> end of the universe; the extent of your surface of the airspace/earth
> depends on how much surface area you own

I.  **Edward** **v.** **Sims** **(1929)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Edwards has a cave that he uses as
        revenue from tourists; Lee says he's entitled to part of the
        cave because his land is on top of it; Lee sues Edwards, asking
        for injunction ordering Edwards not to go into the portion of
        the cave that's below Lee's surface; the court ordered a survey
        of the cave

    b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** who owns the portion of the cave
        that is under the surface that FP Lee owns?

    c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** Lee owns property above part of the
        cave, so therefore Lee owns part of the cave

    d.  **[Dissent:]{.underline}** ad coelum doctrine is not true now
        and never has been; the rule should be that owners of land own
        everything on, above, and below the land, to the extent that the
        owner can both subject that stuff to her dominion and use it for
        their benefit

> **Sequential** **Possession**-acquisition of ownership of things that
> have already been owned/already are owned

I.  Happens through voluntary transfer, sale, or gift

II. A suit to recover possession of property cannot be defeated by
    showing that someone else has title that's superior to either the
    two parties to the suit

    a.  **Example:** if A possesses something, then B acquires it, and A
        sues B, B cannot raise as a defense that C has a better right
        than either of them so B gets to keep it

    b.  **Ius/jus** **tertii**-right of a third person---THIS DEFENSE
        DOES NOT EXIST

III. Justifications for no defense of right of a third person

     a.  [Substantive:]{.underline} if defendant wrongfully interfered
         with plaintiff's possession, there is no obligation to treat
         the defendant reasonably based on a third party's right

     b.  [Procedural:]{.underline} common law litigation involves just
         the parties to the case; if people bring in third parties, the
         court may lack sufficient info to determine credibility

IV. **Armory** **v.** **Delamirie** **(1722)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** plaintiff finds a jewel and takes it to
        a jeweler (defendant); defendant takes the jewel and gives
        plaintiff a very lowball price in exchange; plaintiff sues
        defendant for wrongfully taking his property

    b.  [**Sequential** **possession** **issue** **among** **three**
        **people:**]{.underline}

        i.  First, the true owner of the jewel who lost the jewel

        ii. Second, the plaintiff

        iii. Third, the jeweler

    c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** a finder has rights that are good
        against everyone except the true owner; plaintiff gets the jewel

    d.  **[Rule:]{.underline}** the finder of a jewel, though he did not
        by such finding acquire an absolute property or ownership, yet
        he has such a property as will enable him to keep it against all
        but the rightful owner, and consequently may maintain trover

    e.  **[Takeaway:]{.underline}** a finder's rights are still
        subordinate to the rights of the true owner, but are superior
        against anyone else's rights

V.  **Clark** **v.** **Maloney** **(1840)-**both finders

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** plaintiff found pine logs floating in
        the river and anchored them; later, defendant ended up with the
        logs and refused to give them up, claiming to have found them
        floating upstream; plaintiff sued defendant; plaintiff relied on
        the fact that he had possessed the logs

    b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** does the plaintiff have property
        rights to the logs good against the defendant?

    c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** plaintiff wins; the loss of chattel
        does not change the right of property; a property owner doesn't
        lose his rights as a result of losing a chattel

    d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** possession creates prima facie
        evidence that it's yours, and if there's no evidence to the
        contrary, you win; however, it can be rebutted by evidence of
        better title

    e.  **[Rule:]{.underline}** The finder of a chattel, though he does
        not acquire an absolute property, yet has such a property as
        will enable him to keep it against all but the rightful owner

VI. **Anderson** **v.** **Gouldberg** **(1892)-**no finders

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** plaintiff claimed to have cut logs and
        hauled them to a mill; defendant allegedly wrongfully took the
        logs at the mill; plaintiff didn't own the lot where he cut the
        logs

    b.  [**Distinction** **from** **Maloney:**]{.underline} there are no
        finders here; instead, there is a true owner, followed by a
        converter, followed by another converter

    c.  **[Question:]{.underline}** whether bare possession of property,
        though wrongfully obtained, is sufficient to maintain rights
        over a stranger who takes it from him

    d.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** plaintiff wins out

    e.  **[Rule:]{.underline}** possession is good title against all the
        world except those having better title; a first converter has
        rights against any subsequent converters

    f.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** someone who has acquired possession
        of a property has a right to retain that possession against a
        mere stranger

        i.  Court wants to limit violence and conflict

        ii. if the rule was that whichever wrongdoer possesses it now
            gets to keep it, there would be a strong incentive for
            people to try to steal things

> **Nemo** **Dat**- "no one gives what he does not have"; basic
> principle of transferring ownership

I.  A transfers ownership to BB's ownership is limited to what A had

II. A shares ownership with C and sells share to BB ends up sharing
    ownership with C

III. A doesn't own anything but purports to sell something to BB ends
     up with nothing

IV. **"Prior** **in** **time,** **prior** **in** **right"** principle-if
    A sells a parcel to B, and then A "sells" that parcel again to C,
    then B gets the parcel and C gets nothing

> **Adverse** **Possession**-ownership is displaced by an adverse
> possessor; the adverse possessor's right is good even as against the
> true owner

![](media/image40.png){width="4.534722222222222in"
height="1.5347222222222223in"}

I.  **Actual**-you must actually possess the thing; you're doing things
    that show you're actually possessing it

    a.  Examples

        i.  Building a fence

        ii. Sleeping there

        iii. Planting flowers

    b.  Things that would not satisfy

        i.  Simply telling people you own it but never going on the land

        ii. Physically occupying only part of the property

II. **Exclusive**-AP must possess property to the exclusion of others,
    especially to the true owner

    a.  Doesn't mean that no one else can USE the property, just that no
        one else can OWN the property

    b.  To be exclusive, the AP must

        i.  Evince an intention to possess the land to the exclusion of
            everyone else's claim

        ii. Have conduct that gives an unequivocal indication that the
            AP was exercising the dominion of a sole owner

III. **Open** **and** **notorious**-ensures that the TO had notice
     (actual or constructive) of the adverse possession; not an actual
     "notice" requirement

     a.  **Scott** **v.** **Anderson-Tully** **(2015)**

         i.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Scott owned land; Anderson Tully
             removed timber from Scott's land; Scott sued; AT argued
             that the land was theirs; AT marked the purported property
             line years earlier and the disputed acreage was on their
             side of that line; blue paint marked the property line and
             the community members saw it

         ii. **[Holding:]{.underline}** AT acquired the land through
             adverse possession; no one complained about the line drawn;
             no one interfered with the use

IV. **Continuous**

    a.  **Howard** **v.** **Kunto** **(1970)**

        i.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Howards wanted to claim title to
            Lot B, but the Kuntos thought that they had title to Lot B;
            everyone ended up with the deed to the property next door

        ii. **[Question:]{.underline}** was the Kuntos occupancy of Lot
            B continuous enough to satisfy adverse possession?

        iii. **[Discussion:]{.underline}**

             1.  Was summer occupancy enough?

                 a.  Court said yes, good enough to satisfy continuity
                     because the property was summer vacation property

                 b.  Summer occupancy constitutes ordinary use

             2.  Was only being there for a year enough?

                 a.  Court says yes because **tacking** is allowed-
                     current adverse possessor can tack their time onto
                     the previous adverse possessor's time if they
                     satisfy the requirement of **privity**

                     i.  **Privity-**must be adequate/reasonable
                         connection between the current AP and the
                         previous possessor

                         1.  Can show privity through having a deed

                         2.  In this case, the deed was for the wrong
                             lot, but that didn't matter because the
                             connection Kunto showed was reasonable
                             enough

        iv. **[Holding:]{.underline}** the Kuntos occupancy was
            continuous enough to![](media/image3.png){width="7.09375in"
            height="2.2395833333333335in"}

> constitute adverse possession

V.  **Adverse** **under** **a** **claim** **of** **right**

    a.  Possible ways to show claim of right

        i.  Adverse possession was done in good faith (rarely required)

            1.  **Carpenter** **v.** **Ruperto** **(1982)**-no ownership
                of the property by adverse possession where Carpenter
                occupied a plot of land that she knew wasn't hers but
                did it anyway; good faith was required to become an
                adverse possessor

        ii. Adverse possession was done in bad faith---you know the
            property was not yours (minority position)

        iii. Faith is not relevant (most favored)

    b.  **Adverse**-if the person who was occupying the property had
        permission, then there is no AP

        i.  PERMISSION DEFEATS ADVERSE POSSESSION

    c.  **Color** **of** **title** **(only** **a** **minority** **of**
        **jurisdictions** **require** **this)**-being in possession of a
        deed

        i.  When acting under color of title, you may have to possess
            land for a shorter amount of time before you come to
            adversely possess it (statute of limitations may be less)

VI. **For** **the** **statutorily** **required** **time**-varies from
    jurisdiction to jurisdiction

    a.  NY is 10 years

    b.  There's a possibility that the clock may be suspended/paused if
        the owner is suffering from a disability

        i.  Disability must have been prevalent at the time the AP
            entered/the AP began

VII. Theories to justify having adverse possession rules

     a.  **Reliance** **interest**-AP, over time, has come to rely on
         the fact that they have access to the property

         i.  **Endowment** **effect**-people who have been given
             property will demand more money to sell that property than
             they would have given to buy the property

         ii. **Loss** **aversion**-the badness you feel losing property
             is greater than the goodness you feel gaining it

         iii. **Personhood**-your personhood is tied up in your
              relationship to the property; some property becomes
              personal to the possessor, so therefore it is especially
              bad if you're deprived of it

     b.  **Favoring** **active** **users** **over** **people** **who**
         **are** **sleeping** **on** **their** **rights**

         i.  Shifts property ownership from people who are sitting
             around doing nothing to people who are actually doing
             something with that property

         ii. Would not apply to unimproved property because no one would
             be making economic use of it

     c.  **Decreases** **the** **transaction** **costs** **of**
         **determining** **life**

         i.  When you buy land, you want to make sure the person selling
             you the land is actually entitled to do so; want to rely on
             the fact that the person selling the property actually owns
             the property

## **Property** **of** **the** **Human** **Body**

I.  **Moore** **v.** **Regents** **of** **the** **University** **of**
    **California** **(1990)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Moore needed surgery; the surgeon
        didn't disclose to Moore that Moore's spleen had unusual
        characteristics that would make the surgeon's upcoming research
        easier; surgeon took cells from Moore's spleen and used them in
        research; surgeon received a patent and sold the rights to the
        patent; Moore sued the surgeon and UCLA, including a claim for
        conversion

    b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** the spleen was not Moore's property,
        so no claim for conversion; he had no right to the income
        streams that were derived from the spleen

    c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** there was no cause of action for
        conversion under existing law

        i.  Conversion requires there be actual interference with either

            1.  \(1\) ownership, or

            2.  \(2\) a right of possession

        ii. Moore had no right of possession in the spleen, nor did he
            want to have the spleen back; he also did not own the spleen

        iii. You don't need property rights to protect patient autonomy,
             you just need informed consent

        iv. Balance of patients' autonomy and researchers needing to be
            secure from liability when doing research on biomedical
            material

            1.  The court favored the researchers and made ownership of
                body parts clear by saying that it's the hospital's
                property

    d.  **[Dissent:]{.underline}** don't need to extend conversion
        liability because Moore already may have had a property right in
        his spleen

        i.  Some property you can sell but you aren't allowed to give it
            away

            1.  Example: assets held by a company that is contemplating
                bankruptcy

        ii. Some property can be given away but cannot be sold

            1.  Example: wild game or fish that a recreational hunter
                has caught pursuant to a license

        iii. Some property can be neither given nor sold

             1.  Example: professional licenses; prescription drugs

        iv. **[Upshot:]{.underline}** the mere fact that there are
            restrictions on some types of property does not mean that it
            isn't property; property ownership can come with substantial
            restrictions

# [**The** **Right** **to** **Exclude**]{.underline}

## **Trespass** **to** **Land**

I.  **Jacque** **v.** **Steenberg** **Homes,** **Inc.** **(1997)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** mobile home to be delivered to Jacque's
        neighbor; Steenberg wanted to go through Jacque's land to
        deliver it; Jacque denied them entrance; Steenberg decided to
        use Jacques' land anyway; Jacque sued; trial court awarded
        Jacque

> \$1 in nominal damages, \$100,000 in punitive damages

b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** for trespass, can punitive damages be
    awarded even if there were no actual compensatory damages?

c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** punitive damages can be awarded in an
    action for intentional trespass even when there are no compensatory
    damages; Jacque was awarded the punitive damages

d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** in certain situations of trespass, the
    actual harm is not in the damage done to the land, but in the loss
    of the individual's right to exclude others from her property; if a
    defendant won't act like a gentleman, then heavy damages will be
    required to deter him

e.  **[Rule:]{.underline}** property owners have a very strong right to
    exclude others from their property, but from a policy perspective
    there may be concerns in having a strong right so there may be
    reasons to limit that right

<!-- -->

II. **Hinman** **v.** **Pacific** **Air** **Transport** **(1936)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Pacific Air Transport flew planes above
        Hinman's land; Hinman sued, seeking injunction barring PAT from
        flying above his land and \$90,000 in damages; Hinman claimed
        ownership of the air up to 150 feet

![](media/image10.png){width="1.05625in" height="2.347916666666667in"}

> These two cases have the same exact facts but

b.  [**Applying** **Jacque** **Court** **Reasoning** **(NOT**
    **ACCEPTED**]{.underline} **[VIEW):]{.underline}** Hinman would win
    b/c even though no damage to property, he has strong interest in
    excluding others

c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** Hinman loses; there was no trespass, so
    the traditional/Jacque rule doesn't apply; no violation of rights
    because there are no rights to be violated

d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** ad coelum never was the law, so there's
    no worry about overruling it, nor does it apply; ad coelum merely
    confers a right for you to use the air above your land, doesn't'
    allow you to exclude others from it

    i.  The essence of property is dominion---if something is property
        it has to be capable of having exclusive possession

        1.  The air and sea are incapable of private ownership, except
            to the extent that they can actually be used

e.  **[Rule:]{.underline}** a land owner owns so much space above his
    land as much as he actually uses, but only so long as he's actually
    using it

f.  **[Takeaway:]{.underline}** an owner would have a trespass claim for
    use of airspace above his land which is injurious to his land or
    which constitutes an actual interference with his possession or his
    beneficial use thereof

<!-- -->

III. **Baker** **v.** **Howard** **County** **Hunt** **(1936)**-repeated
     trespass

     a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Baker sought injunction to stop
         repeated trespasses on his land by hunters and their dogs;
         Baker shot some of the dogs because they were threatening his
         chickens

     b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** whether equity may afford
         injunctive relief against a series of trespasses, which, while
         not continuous, are nevertheless part of a single course of
         conduct...

     c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** the rights of fox hunters are
         subordinate to the rights of land owners, so plaintiff is
         afforded injunctive relief

     d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** plaintiff had hands that were
         clean enough, and money damages would not be good enough for
         the plaintiff

         i.  Defendants had manifested an intent to persist, so the
             trespasses would happen again, and money damages wouldn't
             be adequate to solve that issue

         ii. The goal is to stop the trespasswould make sense to issue
             an injunction

     e.  **[Rule:]{.underline}** two requirements must be met to get an
         equitable remedy

         i.  There is no adequate remedy in law---money damages will not
             be adequate to address situation

         ii. Plaintiff has morally and legally clean hands \[with
             respect to this incident\]

IV. **Pile** **v.** **Pedrick** **(1895)**-continuous trespass

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** foundation that defendant built was
        slightly across the property line onto plaintiff's land; mistake
        was made based off a surveyor's fuck up; Pedrick offered to chip
        off the offending

> encroachment and restore Pile's property; Pile refused and sued for an
> injunction

b.  [**Two** **Possible** **Remedies:**]{.underline}

    i.  Court could treat foundation as a permanent trespass and require
        defendant to pay damages to compensate for total effect of
        trespassPLAINTIFF DID NOT CHOOSE

    ii. Plaintiff could require that defendant remove offending
        foundation and tear it down from [defendant's]{.underline}
        [side]{.underline}PLAINTIFF CHOSE

c.  **[Question:]{.underline}** was the lower court correct in ordering
    that the defendant removes the wall from the defendant's side

d.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** injunction was correctly ordered

e.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** we do not see how the court below could
    have done otherwise

<!-- -->

V.  **Golden** **Press,** **Inc.** **v.** **Rylands** **(1951)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** virtually identical to Pile; a wall
        that was 160 feet long built on a foundation; tiny encroachment
        onto Rylands land

    b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** injunctive relief denied; the only
        remedy is money damages for the market value of the encroachment

    c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** cost of removal is enormously
        burdensome to defendant, and damage against plaintiff is very
        minimal--- balancing of equities is heavily against issuing an
        injunction

    d.  **[Rule:]{.underline}** Where defendant's encroachment is
        unintentional and slight, plaintiff's use not affected and his
        damage small and compensable, while the cost of removal is so
        great as to cause grave hardship or otherwise make its removal
        unconscionable, mandatory injunction may properly be denied and
        plaintiff is relegated to compensation in damages

> trespassed-upon property worth less, but instead makes the property

I.  **Producers** **Lumber** **&** **Supply** **Co.** **v.** **Olney**
    **Buildings** **Co.** **(1960)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Orts sold a lot to Producers, who had
        the intention of building a home on it; someone screwed up and
        sold the lot again even though it was already owned; Orts
        mistakenly built a house on a lot they didn't own, which was
        trespass that made the lot more valuable; once they realized
        their mistake, they knocked down the house; Producers sued; jury
        found in favor of Producers

    b.  [**Traditional** **Rule:**]{.underline} if a builder puts a
        building on someone else's land without that landowner's
        knowledge and consent, the building becomes a fixture and
        therefore belongs to the landowner

> All remedies ensure that the land and the house

c.  [**Exception** **to** **Traditional** **Rule:**]{.underline} if the
    improver built in a [good]{.underline} [faith mistaken
    belief]{.underline} that he owned the land on which they built the
    building

d.  **[Discussion:]{.underline}** in this case, there may be equitable
    remedies available to people with clean hands

    i.  If building is removable, builder may be permitted to get the
        house back![](media/image12.png){width="0.445832239720035in"
        height="1.3666666666666667in"}

    ii. Builder may be allowed to recover the market value of the
        improvement by selling them to the landowner at market
        rate---compelling landowner to buy the improvements at market
        rate

    iii. Builder could buy the land at the market price pre- improvement
         price

    iv. If neither party is interested in above scenarios, court could
        order selling the land and the house to a third party and divide
        profits between landowner and builder

e.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** Orts must pay Producers for the building
    as well

f.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** Orts cannot prevail on plea of good
    faith because of his malicious destruction of the property (his
    hands were not clean because he resorted to self-help and took the
    law into his own hands)

## **Self-Help**

I.  Uncontroversial forms include putting up a wall, locking the door,
    installing alarms

II. In general, someone who already possesses real property is permitted
    to use [reasonable force]{.underline} to prevent or terminate a
    trespass

    a.  NO LETHAL FORCE ALLOWED, IT IS NOT REASONABLE

III. **Berg** **v.** **Wiley** **(1978)**

     a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** plaintiff/tenant had a restaurant in
         defendant/landlord's building; plaintiff was accused of health
         code violations; lease said that if tenant breached the terms,
         landlord had option to retake possession; landlord wanted to
         retake possession but plaintiff refused; plaintiff closed the
         restaurant to do repairs; defendant went back, changed the
         locks, and re-lent the property to someone else

     b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** had the tenant abandoned the
         property, and was the termination/defendant's self-help
         unlawful as a matter of law?

     c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** defendant's actions were not allowed
         and unlawful

     d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** traditional common law rule is
         REJECTED, self-help is NEVER allowed

         i.  The common law rule seems to incite violence

         ii. Common law self-help is allowed if:

             1.  The landlord is entitled to possession; AND

             2.  The means of reentry are peaceable

         iii. Here, there was a risk of violence, so the entry was not
              peaceable

     e.  [**Rule** **that** **this** **Court** **Adopts:**]{.underline}
         "modern trend" that says that self-help is never available
         because there's an inherent incentive for violence if self-help
         was an option

     f.  **[Note:]{.underline}** some jurisdictions relax the bar
         against self-help for commercial tenants

IV. **Williams** **v.** **Ford** **Motor** **Credit** **Company**
    **(1982)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Cathy and David Williams owned a car
        together while they were married; they got a divorce and the
        court gave the car to Cathy; David sent people to repossess the
        car; the repo men were very polite and left with the car

    b.  [**Applying** **Berg** **Analysis** **(NOT** **ACCEPTED**
        **HERE):**]{.underline} repossession and self-help would not be
        allowed; these things are never peaceable so the repossession
        wouldn't be permitted

    c.  [**Distinction** **from** **Berg:**]{.underline} Berg=real
        property, Williams=personal property; for repossession of
        personal property, most courts agree with Williams majority and
        allow self-help

    d.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** repossession was permissible;
        self-help permitted

    e.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** UCC allows repossession without
        judicial intervention if you can do it without breaching the
        peace

        i.  There's a high threshold for what's peaceable (it's hard to
            make something non-peaceable)

        ii. As long as there's no actual confrontation, a repossession
            is peaceable

## **Exceptions** **to** **the** **Right** **to** **Exclude**

### **Necessity**

a.  **Ploof** **v.** **Putnam** **(1908)**

    i.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Putnam owned an island; Ploof moored
        his boat at Putnam's dock; Putnam unmoored the boat and Ploof
        and his family were injured in a storm; Ploof sued, claiming
        trespass and that Putnam had a duty to let Ploof moor his boat
        at the dock during the storm

    ii. **[Holding:]{.underline}** remanded to lower court to determine
        who wins; circumstance dependent; eventually Ploof won

    iii. **[Rationale:]{.underline}** basic rule is that necessity will
         justify something that would otherwise be a trespass

    iv. **[Takeaway:]{.underline}** necessity doctrine applies with
        special force to human lives

### **Custom**

a.  **McConico** **v.** **Singleton** **(1818)**

    i.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** plaintiff owned unenclosed and
        unimproved land; plaintiff warned defendant not to hunt there;
        defendant hunted there anyway

    ii. **[Holding:]{.underline}** general right of hunters to enter
        [unenclosed]{.underline} rural land in pursuit of game without
        first obtaining permission of the owner

    iii. **[Rationale:]{.underline}** custom of allowing hunters on
         improved and unenclosed land is well attested

         1.  Trying to change this custom would at one time have led to
             civil war

         2.  Hunting is a major profit source

         3.  Too burdensome to make hunters sort out where they are in
             relation to property lines

    iv. **[Takeaway:]{.underline}** customs that are so deeply rooted in
        the law usually take precedent

### **Public** **Policy**

a.  **State** **v.** **Shack** **(1971)**

    i.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** two defendants wanted to provide legal
        and medical services to migrants who were working and living on
        Tedesco's farm; Tedesco said they couldn't go on the property
        alone, but they could meet in Tedesco's office with the migrant
        workers while Tedesco was present; defendants declined, saying
        they had a right to see the migrant men in private; Tedesco
        filed a trespass complaint

    ii. **[Holding:]{.underline}** entering the property was not a
        trespass; the farmer did not have a right to exclude

    iii. **[Rationale:]{.underline}** the ownership of real property
         does not include the right to bar access of government services
         to migrant workers, so there was no violation of a right

         1.  The purpose of the federal statute which funded these
             nonprofits was to aid migrant farm workers and their
             families, and allowing exclusion of these nonprofit workers
             would frustrate this goal

         2.  The farm has no legitimate need to deprive migrant workers
             of the opportunity for aid

         3.  "Property rights serve human values"

### **Public** **Accommodation** **Laws**

a.  Innkeepers and common carriers had two duties:

    i.  Serve anyone who requested service

    ii. Provide reasonable prices

b.  **Uston** **v.** **Resorts** **International** **Hotel,** **Inc.**
    **(1982)**

    i.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Resorts banned Uston from playing cards
        at its hotel because he had a trick for counting cards; Resorts
        said that Uston's strategy increased his chances of winning
        money

    ii. **[Holding:]{.underline}** Uston is permitted to play in
        Resorts; Resorts is precluded from banning Uston

    iii. **[Rationale:]{.underline}** common law right to exclude has
         been preceded by statute

         1.  **[Standard:]{.underline}** common law right to exclude is
             limited by a competing right of reasonable access to public
             places, where "reasonable" is determined by facts of each
             case

    iv. **[Takeaway:]{.underline}** the more you want to benefit from
        the public, the more you have to cater to the public; the more
        you open yourself up to the public, the more you are prohibited
        from excluding members of the public

### **Antidiscrimination** **Laws**

a.  **Shelley** **v.** **Kraemer** **(1948)**

    i.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** residential neighborhood where owners
        of the property in the neighborhood tried to lock in a custom by
        means of contract; the custom was racially discriminatory

> ---not selling property to African Americans; the Shelley's, who were
> African American, bought land; Kraemer, a property owner in
> neighborhood, sued to enforce the covenant

ii. **[Question:]{.underline}** was the covenant judicially enforceable?

iii. **[Holding:]{.underline}** judicial enforcement of racially
     restrictive covenants to block the sale of a home from a willing
     seller to a willing buyer is state action; but for the act of
     intervention by state courts, petitioners would've been free to
     occupy the property without restraint; **violation** **of** **EPC**

iv. **[Rationale:]{.underline}** all citizens of the US shall have the
    same property rights; your property rights are the same no matter
    your race

v.  **[Takeaway:]{.underline}** racially restrictive covenants are not
    enforceable in court (you can make them, just not enforce them)

> [**Relinquishing** **Sovereignty**]{.underline} **Abandonment**
> **and** **Destruction**-what happens if an owner of property would
> rather give up the right of ownership than continue bearing the
> burdens of ownership?

I.  Ways to get rid of property

    a.  Walk away from it

    b.  Throw it away

    c.  Destroy it

II. Real property cannot be abandoned (Pocono Springs)

    a.  Worries about encouraging socially inefficient behavior---if you
        abandon property you can avoid internalizing some of the costs
        you've created by using the property

    b.  Negative externalities on the surrounding neighborhood if you do
        nothing with the property

III. **Pocono** **Springs** **Civic** **Association,** **Inc.** **v.**
     **MacKenzie** **(1995)**

     a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** MacKenzie bought land in a vacation
         home area; no one wanted to buy the property, so MacKenzie
         believed the land was worthless; he wanted to abandon the land
         because he didn't want to pay property taxes; he asserted he
         had abandoned it;

> Pocono Springs sued to collect HOA fees

b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** has the real property been abandoned by
    MacKenzie?

c.  [**Things** **MacKenzie** **Did** **That** **He** **Claims**
    **Constitutes**]{.underline} **[Abandonment:]{.underline}**

    i.  Tried to turn it over to Pocono Springs Civic Association

    ii. Tried to gift it as a park

    iii. Stopped paying real estate taxes

    iv. Signed a notarized statement expressing his desire to abandon

    v.  Hadn't visited the lot or used the development services in nine
        years

d.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** MacKenzie did not abandon his property
    because he did not relinquish his title---he tried but failed

e.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** Real property CANNOT be abandoned under
    PA law (and traditional common law)

f.  **[Rule:]{.underline}** Under PA law, abandonment of property
    requires:

    i.  Voluntary relinquishment of all title, claim, right, and
        possession; and

    ii. Done with the intention of terminating ownership; and

    iii. Done without vesting that title in any other person; and

    iv. Done with the intention of not reclaiming further possession or
        resuming ownership, possession, or enjoyment

IV. **Eyerman** **v.** **Mercantile** **Trust** **Co.** **(1975)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Louise Johnston owned property in a
        "private place"; when Johnston died, her will stated that her
        house should be knocked down and destroyed; the subdivision was
        considered architecturally noteworthy and the neighbors were
        outraged; the neighbors sued seeking an injunction to stop the
        demolition

    b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** plaintiffs were awarded an injunction
        to stop the demolition of the house

    c.  **[Rule:]{.underline}** destruction of property after death may
        not be allowed

    d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** decided on policy
        considerationsfulfilling the terms of the will would cause
        unwarranted destruction with no sufficient benefit to anyone

        i.  Destruction would cause monetary loss

        ii. Knocking down the house would be like a "missing tooth"

        iii. Neighbors would suffer a loss of their property values if
             the house was demolished

        iv. St. Louis needed housing

    e.  **[Dissent:]{.underline}** policy of **testator** **freedom**-if
        you own property you are free to decide what to do with it when
        you die

        i.  This policy favors giving force to the explicitly expressed
            will of the testator

## **Transfer** **of** **Property** **and** **Alienation**

### **Justifications** **for** **transfer** **of** **property**

a.  Enhances autonomycurrent owner of the property can shed the
    gatekeeper role and is no longer burdened with it; allows you to
    acquire things that you want

b.  Promotes efficiencymakes society wealthier because it enables
    mutually beneficial exchanges; enables property to end up in the
    hands of the highest valuing user

c.  Enables owners to designate a successor

<!-- -->

II. [**Traditional** **common** **law** **rule:**]{.underline} absolute
    restraints on alienation are VOID

    a.  X is not allowed to transfer property to Y on condition that Y
        will never transfer it to anyone else

III. **Irons** **v.** **Smallpiece** **(1819)**

     a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** action for conversion of personal
         property; the father "gave" his son two colts, but possession
         never changed hands; the son later made an agreement to
         purchase hay, but no hay was delivered until just before the
         father died

     b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** was this actually a gift?

     c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** there was no gift unless there was
         ACTUAL DELIVERY of the item, which never happened, or if there
         was a deed to the gift

     d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** this is what English law says; the
         dad did not ever deliver the gift to the son

IV. **Foster** **v.** **Reiss** **(1955)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Reiss going into surgery, so she left a
        note to her husband giving instructions with respect to various
        bits of personal property; Reiss went into a coma after the
        surgery and died nine days later; her will gave \$1 to her
        husband and the rest of her decedents; decedents sued the
        husband, seeking to obtain the bank documents and money that had
        been claimed in the letter; husband claimed they were his
        because Reiss had given them to him as a gift; descendants said
        there was no gift and they were part of the estate

    b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** the husband lost because there was no
        gift

    c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** there was no delivery during the
        donor's lifetime

        i.  The letter establishes donative intent, but that intent is
            insufficient to constitute a transfer

    d.  **[Rule:]{.underline}** there must be an affirmative act of
        donation by the donor

    e.  **[Dissent:]{.underline}** we know what Ethel's intent was, so
        it should've been followed through with

V.  **Gilbert** **v.** **McSpadden** **(1936)**-delivery requirement for
    deeds

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Gilbert sold parts of his land to his
        children; Gilbert kept deeds in his possession and continued to
        exercise dominion over the land; a few years later he brings the
        deeds to his daughter's house to deliver them; he immediately
        goes to bed and then dies in his sleep; the children find the
        deed the next day and run to have them recorded

    b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** was this a valid transfer of a deed?

    c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** the parcels are still part of the
        parents' estate and do not belong to the kids; the sale never
        happened

    d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** a deed does not become effective
        until it's delivered; Gilbert's intent to deliver was not
        sufficient, he must have actually parted possession

## **Licenses** **and** **Bailments**

I.  **Licenses**-waiver of the right to exclude; revocable permission to
    enter

    a.  Temporary and revocable

II. **Bailments**-temporarily transfer possession or custody of an item

    a.  Bailor-an owner of temporarily relinquishes possession

    b.  Bailee-the person who receives possession of the item

III. **Wood** **v.** **Leadbitter** **(1845)**-example of a license

     a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Wood bought a ticket to a horse race
         which was held on an estate; the aristocrat who owned the
         estate was Lord Eglintoun; Wood showed up at the race and the
         Lord's servant,

> Leadbitter, ejected Wood before the race ended

b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** was this allowed?

c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** this was allowed; it was just a license,
    and mere licenses are revocable at any time for any reason; tickets
    to events are licenses

d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** distinction between license and grant

    i.  [License]{.underline}-a waiver of the right to exclude; gives
        permission to someone to come onto property

        1.  By nature, they're revocable---if someone invites you, they
            can promptly uninvite you

    ii. [License coupled with grants]{.underline}-irrevocable; the
        grantor is estopped from defeating his or her own grant; not
        revocable until the grant is complete

        1.  Example: A sells a sofa to B, and B agrees to pay the money
            and actually does pay, A then invites B over to pick up
            sofa. As B enters A's apartment, A says "I am revoking the
            license for you to come in." B would then be out the money
            paid and also out the sofa. A would be defeating the grant
            by revoking the license

e.  **[Takeaway:]{.underline}** licenses are revocable at any time for
    any reason

<!-- -->

IV. **Allen** **v.** **Hyatt** **Regency-Nashville** **Hotel**
    **(1984)**-example of a bailment

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Hyatt-Regency had a public parking
        garage; Allen parked in the garage because he thought it would
        be safer to do so; when he came back a few hours later, his car
        was gone; Allen sued the hotel

    b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** had a bailment been created when
        Allen left his car in the hotel's garage?

    c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** there was a bailment, despite the
        fact that there was a disclaimer on the ticket

    d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** parking lot was attended by hotel
        staff, and looking at precedent it shows that bailments are
        created when lots are attended

        i.  Reasons why bailment had been created:

            1.  It was an enclosed, indoors, attended, commercial garage

            2.  There was regular security personnel patrolling

        ii. Policy reason: the garage owner is better situated to
            protect a parked car than a person who parks and leaves; the
            garage owner can distribute the risk across a wide range of
            people by charging higher parking fees

## **Deeper** **Dive** **into** **Bailments**

I.  Justice Story proposed a set of rules for bailments

    a.  WHEN bailment is for sole benefit of the BAILERlaw requires
        only slight diligence on the part of the bailee, and makes him
        responsible only for gross neglect

    b.  WHEN bailment is for sole benefit of the BAILEE law requires
        great diligence on the part of the bailee, and makes him
        responsible for slight neglect

    c.  WHEN bailment is reciprocally beneficial to BOTH PARTIESlaw
        requires ordinary diligence on the part of the bailee, and makes
        him responsible for ordinary neglect

II. [Modern alternative:]{.underline} standard of reasonable care for
    all bailments

    a.  Look at all relevant circumstances

    b.  Favored by most modern commentators

III. Courts will be harsher on a bailee who gives the bailed item back
     to the wrong person

     a.  Courts are stricter about mis-delivery of goods than they are
         about damaged goods

IV. **Cowen** **v.** **Pressprich** **(1922)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** plaintiff agreed to sell and deliver a
        bond to Pressprich; plaintiff accidentally sent the incorrect
        bond to defendant by means of a runner; runner dropped off the
        bond in a slot at defendant's office; defendant realized they
        sent the wrong bond and called for the runner to send it back;
        the runner took the bond and left, but the bond never arrived
        back at plaintiff; plaintiff sued

    b.  [**Plaintif** **f** **Position:**]{.underline} defendant had an
        absolute duty of care to return the bond

    c.  [**Defendant** **Position:**]{.underline} they only had a duty
        of due diligence and had exercised that care

    d.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** plaintiff wins (but this case is
        overruled on appeal); defendant had an absolute duty to deliver
        and they failed; given they didn't use reasonable measures to
        return the bond, they had an absolute duty

    e.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** this was a voluntary bailment

        i.  Except for the brief instant where the bond first went
            through the slot, it was a voluntary bailment

        ii. The duty of care to apply to voluntary bailments with
            respect to mis-delivery is an absolute duty of care

        iii. It is the duty of the bailee to deliver an article to the
             right person and no showing of good faith or innocence can
             release you from that duty

    f.  **[\*\*Dissent:]{.underline}** this was an involuntary bailment

        i.  Taking steps to get rid of an item that you received in
            error is not accepting an item as a bailee

        ii. The slot wasn't an invitation to deliver *any* bond, it was
            just an invitation to deliver bonds that the defendant was
            supposed to receive

        iii. Cannot impose obligations on people by giving them things
             involuntarily

        iv. No liability as long as you use reasonable means to return
            it (duty of reasonable care)

    g.  **[Commentary:]{.underline}** both the majority and the dissent
        seem to be leaning toward a duty of reasonable care

        i.  **Defendant** **won** **on** **appeal**

# [**Law** **of** **Neighbors**]{.underline}

> **Servitudes**-enables more permanent transfer of rights; create
> limited, durable transfer of rights

I.  Under some circumstances, servitudes **RUN** **WITH** **THE**
    **LAND**- bind people who didn't agree to it, merely by the
    relationship between the land and the person who currently owns the
    land

II. Two main varieties:

    a.  **Easements**-grant of a nonpossessory right to use property
        that belongs to someone else; usually waivers of the right to
        exclude

        i.  ALWAYS run with the land (aka they always bind successors)

    b.  **Covenants**-agreements that govern what can or cannot be done
        with respect to property; often commit owners to do something
        that will benefit neighbors

### **[Easements]{.underline}**

I.  Differ from leases because easements convey a right to a particular
    use, rather than a right to possession

II. Differ from licenses (also use rights) because easements are
    irrevocably conveyed and are limited to particular uses

III. **Easements** **appurtenant** **vs.** **easements** **in**
     **gross** (every easement is going to be one or the other, never
     both)

     a.  **Appurtenant**-easements that belong to another PARCEL OF LAND

         i.  Right to cut across Whiteacre to get to
             Blackacre![](media/image9.png){width="1.7465277777777777in"
             height="0.8993055555555556in"}

         ii. Dominant vs. servient

             1.  BENEFITTED parcel = DOMINANT parcel (ask: who is being
                 served?)

             2.  BURDENED parcel = SERVIENT parcel (ask: who is
                 serving?)

         iii. People who own the estates are called "tenants"

         iv. These easements RUN WITH THE LAND

         v.  Benefits its holder in his physical use and enjoyment of
             his own property

         vi. Benefits a particular parcel of land and the ability to use
             and enjoy that land

     b.  **In** **gross**-easements that belong to a particular PERSON

         i.  Stay with the dominant tenant (grantee)

         ii. There are only dominant tenants, not dominant
             parcels![](media/image36.png){width="1.7465277777777777in"
             height="0.8993055555555556in"}

         iii. Rules for transferability differ

              1.  [Sometimes]{.underline} easements in gross are
                  transferable

              2.  Commonly inheritable if they are of commercial
                  character

              3.  Most courts do not allow transfer of recreational
                  easements in gross

         iv. The servient land is burdened, but there is no dominant
             tenement

             1.  The person exercising the easement is deriving
                 benefit/commercial gain not linked to the easement
                 holder's use and enjoyment of his own land

         v.  Common examples: billboards, right to swim in a pond

     c.  Intent of the parties will determine whether an easement is
         appurtenant or in gross

         i.  If the circumstances are unclear, court will determine
             based on circumstances

         ii. If it adds to the enjoyment and use of a neighboring
             property, a court will likely find it appurtenant; if it
             doesn't, likely to be in gross

     d.  How to make an easement

         i.  Strike a deal; buy an easement (easement by grant)

         ii. Easement by implication

         iii. Easement by necessity

         iv. Easement by prescription

### **Affirmative** **easements** **vs.** **negative** **easements**

a.  **Affirmative** **(positive)** **easement**-allows the holder of the
    easement to affirmatively do something on another's parcel

    i.  Common

    ii. Allows me to do something on your property

b.  **Negative** **easement**-allows dominant easement to require that
    servient tenant not do certain things on property that would harm
    the interest of the dominant tenant

    i.  Limited to four categories (stopping interference with):

        1.  Sunlight falling on windows

        2.  Flow of air in a defined channel

        3.  Flow of water in an artificial channel

        4.  Removing lateral support to buildings

V.  **Baseball** **Publishing** **Co.** **v.** **Bruton**
    **(1938)**-easement in gross created by grant

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** defendant owned a building; plaintiff
        negotiated a contract to put a billboard on the side of the
        building in exchange for \$25 a year; contract wasn't sealed and
        BPC kept ad on the wall, paid, and defendant kept sending the
        checks back; defendant later removed the sign; BPC sued for
        specific performance and said the contract was a lease and
        therefore taking down the billboard violates the lease; trial
        court said there was no lease; instead, it was a contract to
        give a license; trial court ordered specific performance for
        license

    b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** the agreement between plaintiff and
        defendant was not a lease nor was it a license; billboard owner
        wins

    c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** it was not a lease because the
        writing did not transfer possession, it only gave a limited use
        right to the billboard company; it was not a license because
        licenses are revocable, so if specific performance was granted
        the defendant could just revoke it; this is an easement in
        gross; the writing here goes beyond a license, it purports to
        give "the exclusive right and privilege to maintain" a certain
        sign on the defendant's wall

        i.  A lease conveys an interest in land, requires a writing to
            comply with the statute of frauds, though not always a seal,
            and transfers possession

        ii. A license merely excuses acts done by one on land in
            possession of another that without the license would be
            trespass, conveys no interest in land, and may be contracted
            for or given orally

VI. **Schwab.** **Timmons** **(1999)**-easement by implication/necessity

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** plaintiff owned two landlocked parcels
        of land; plaintiff then sold one of the plots to relatives, thus
        cutting of its own access to a road; plaintiff sued to get
        access to defendant's parcel to get access to a public road

    b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** plaintiff loses; there is no easement
        by implication or by necessity

    c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** no type of easement exists here

        i.  No easement by grant

        ii. [**Easement** **by** **implication:**]{.underline} protect
            people who are purchasing newly subdivided property from
            being surprised that no easement exists when it would've
            been reasonable for them to believe an easement
            existedrequires **1)** **obvious** **use** **prior** **to**
            **division/separation** **of** **parcels** **and** **2)**
            **necessity** **(obvious** **use** **means** **that**
            **the** **use** **that** **would** **have** **been**
            **permitted** **by** **the** **easement** **had** **to**
            **have** **been** **obviously** **going** **on** **before**
            **the** **property** **was** **subdivided)** **(necessity**
            **means** **that** **without** **the** **easement,** **the**
            **grantee** **of** **the** **property,** **aka** **the**
            **person** **who** **acquired** **the** **subdivided**
            **property,** **cannot** **enjoy** **the** **use** **of**
            **the** **property** **for** **the** **purposes** **to**
            **which** **similar** **property** **is** **customarily**
            **devoted)**

            1.  No easement by implication because there's no obvious
                use prior to separation of property---at the time the
                subdivision happened there was no obvious use of the
                road

        iii. [**Easement** **by** **necessity:**]{.underline} designed
             to prevent having useless parcels

             1.  No easement by necessity here because the severed
                 portion is not landlocked, the portion that was
                 landlocked was the retained portion that the seller
                 kept

             2.  Requirements to be created (all three must be
                 satisfied):

                 a.  There originally was a common owner of all the
                     plots

                 b.  The owner of the parcels severed one portion by
                     conveying it to other people

                 c.  The severed portion is landlocked (no access to
                     public road)

VII. **Warsaw** **v.** **Chicago** **Metallic** **Ceilings,** **Inc.**
     **(1984)**-prescriptive easement

     a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** two adjacent lots and a road that runs
         alongside of them; plaintiff bought one of the lots and built a
         warehouse on it; plaintiff's driveway was not wide enough to be
         usable, so in order for plaintiff to be able to use the
         warehouse, trucks would have to encroach on defendant's land;
         defendant built a smaller building on his lot, and there was
         plenty of space between plaintiff's driveway and defendant's
         building; defendant denied plaintiff an easement every time he
         asked, but plaintiff continued using defendant's land anyway;
         in 1979 defendant planned to put a warehouse on its property;
         plaintiff sued to stop it from being built

     b.  [**Was** **there** **an** **easement?**]{.underline}

         i.  Easement by implication?  NO, no prior use

         ii. Easement by necessity?  NO, plaintiff's property is not
             landlocked

         iii. Easement by prescription?  YES, acquired easement over 25
              feet of defendant's land

     c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** affirmed lower court ruling, there
         was an easement by prescription; compensation is not owed for
         the cost of removing the building; it would've been hugely
         socially/economically costly to not have this easement

     d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** elements of prescriptive easements
         were met

         i.  Elements for creation of prescriptive easementthere must
             be use that is:

             1.  Open and notorious, and

             2.  Continuous, and

             3.  Adverse for five years, and

             4.  With a definite line of travel

         ii. To satisfy the adverse requirement, the continuous use
             without landowner's interference is presumptively enough to
             show it was adverse as long as there was no evidence of
             permission

             1.  PERMISSION DEFEATS ADVERSENESS

         iii. There was evidence that defendant didn't give permission

              1.  If defendant had given permission, it would've been a
                  license

     e.  **[Takeaway:]{.underline}** if you've let people rely on your
         property for a long enough time, you're shit out of luck

VIII. **Holbrook** **v.** **Taylor** **(1976)**-easement by estoppel

      a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Holbrook gave permission to coal
          miners to cut a road across his property to transport coal out
          of a mine; the road then ceased to be used; 20 years later,
          Taylor bought a lot next to Holbrook and built a house; Taylor
          got Holbrook's permission to use the road for construction,
          but after construction he continued to use the road for access
          to the house; there was no other reasonable place to build the
          road for access to Taylor's lot; Holbrook then demanded some
          sort of writing from Taylor to make it official; Taylor
          testified that it was an attempt to pay Holbrook, and Taylor
          refused to pay

      b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** there was no prescriptive easement
          because there was permission; Holbrook is estopped from
          revoking the license for Taylor to use the roadway because
          Holbrook knew that Taylor was going to significant expense in
          reliance on that roadway

      c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** Taylor has relied on Holbrook's
          permission and has gone to considerable expense based on that
          reliance

          i.  Easement by estoppel (all three must be satisfied)

              1.  Owner must have given someone permission to use the
                  owner's property in a specified way

              2.  A reasonable person would not have thought that the
                  permission would have been revoked

              3.  The recipient of permission must have spent money as a
                  result of reasonably relying on permission
                  (detrimental reliance)

IX. **Fontainebleau** **Hotel** **Corp.** **v.** **Forty-Five**
    **Twenty-Five,** **Inc.** **(1959)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** two hotels; Fontainebleau wanted to
        build a really big building on their property that would block
        sunlight from reaching the Eden Roc's pool deck in the winter
        months; Eden Roc sough injunction to stop construction of the
        building that would block the sun; Eden Roc alleged that malice
        and ill will caused Fontainebleau to build the building

    b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** Eden Roc did not have an easement for
        light and air across Fontainebleau's property

    c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** no negative easement exists

        i.  *Sic* *utere* principle does not mean that neighbors can
            never do anything that interferes with a neighbor use, they
            can only not do something that interferes with neighbor's
            lawful rights

            1.  No case has been cited that shows that people have a
                right to free flow of light or air across a neighbor's
                land

            2.  In order for Eden Roc to be beneficiary of easement over
                Fontainebleau, it must be the case that such an easement
                can exist

            3.  Unimpeded sunlight does not fall within permitted
                categories of easements, so there cannot be a negative
                easement

    d.  [**Spite** **Fences:**]{.underline} building things in spite is
        not allowed; some states will not permit the construction of
        walls/fences if:

        i.  They are intended to block the neighbor's windows, and

        ii. They provide no benefit to the builder except enjoyment from
            the neighbor's suffering

### [**Termination** **of** **Easements**]{.underline}

I.  Termination

    a.  **Termination** **by** **deed**-come to an agreement where the
        easement is eliminated

    b.  **Termination** **by** **merger**-when property merges, an
        easement on one of those properties disappears

    c.  **Termination** **through** **adverse** **possession**

    d.  **Termination** **through** **abandonment/implied**
        **abandonment** **through** **nonuse**

        i.  Not enough that a person simply stopped using it

        ii. Nonuse PLUS some affirmative act that manifests the intent
            to relinquish the easement

    e.  Easements by necessity automatically terminate if the necessity
        ends

II. Loss through misuse

    a.  **Penn** **Bowling** **Recreation** **Center,** **Inc.** **v.**
        **Hot** **Shoppes,** **Inc.** **(1949**

        i.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Penn Bowling owned a plot of land
            that abutted a road; PB then sold a portion of their land to
            Hot Shoppes, but in doing so they reserved an easement of
            access; later, PB bought an adjacent parcel and built a
            building that straddled their two parcels; PB used the
            easement for transportation in and out of the building; Hot
            Shoppes physically blocked access to the easement; each
            party sued

        ii. [**Hot** **Shoppes** **Position:**]{.underline} claimed they
            were entitled to do it because the easement didn't exist
            anymore

            1.  Claimed that PB forfeited the easement by expanding its
                use in connection with other parcels

            2.  Claimed PB misused the easement by parking on it

            3.  Claimed that PB's own building made use of the easement
                for access impossible

        iii. **[Holding:]{.underline}** expansion of the use of the
             easement was permissible; the mere fact that they're making
             more intensive use of the easement than they were doing
             before was not enough to constitute misuse

             1.  **Use** **of** **an** **easement** **with**
                 **additional** **parcels,** **however,** **would**
                 **not** **be** **permissible**

> [**Covenants-about** **the** **use** **or** **nonuse** **of**
> **land**]{.underline}

I.  A promise to do or not do something with respect to land

II. Unlike easements, covenants are [purely contractual]{.underline}

III. Two variations---both the same thing, only difference is
     enforcement and remedy

     a.  SUING FOR MONEY?  plaintiff seeking to enforce covenant as

> **Real** **covenant**

b.  SEEKING INJUNCTION?  plaintiff seeking to enforce covenant as
    **Equitable** **servitude**

<!-- -->

IV. Covenants RUN WITH THE LAND to bind successors

> [Covenant Running with the Land Analysis]{.underline}

1.  Figure out who is BURDENED PARTY and who is BENEFITED PARTY

    a.  Burdened=party being forced to do/not do something

    b.  Benefited=party who is stopping someone from doing/not doing
        something

2.  Determine whether it's a REAL COVENANT or EQUITABLE SERVITUDE

    a.  If remedy sought is money damagesreal covenant (move to STEP 3)

    b.  If remedy sought is injunctionequitable servitude (move to STEP
        4)

3.  FOR REAL COVENANTS: Figure out whether you need a BURDEN RUNNING, a
    BENEFIT RUNNING, or both

    a.  In order for the **[BURDEN]{.underline}** of a real covenant to
        run:

        i.  OG agreement in **writing**

        ii. Two OG parties must have **intended** for the agreement to
            bind successors

        iii. Agreement must **touch** **and** **concern** the land
             (promise must affect the parties' legal relation as land
             owners)

        iv. **Horizontal** **and** **vertical** **privity**

            1.  [Horizontal]{.underline}-relationship between A1 and B1;
                succession of estate; relatively difficult to establish;
                common obstacle

                a.  A1 and B1 being merely neighbors does not qualify

                b.  Does not require complete succession of estate

            2.  [Vertical]{.underline}-any non-hostile relationship
                between A1 and A2

                a.  Requires COMPLETE succession of estate, not merely
                    succession of part of the estate

        v.  Must be **notice**-the burdened party must have had notice
            of the promise

            1.  Actual notice

            2.  Constructive notice

                a.  Record notice-recorded in documents that were
                    available; you should have gone to check

                b.  Inquiry notice-when you didn't know but you should
                    have asked around

    b.  In order for the BENEFIT of a real covenant to run:

        i.  OG agreement in **writing**

        ii. **Intent** for benefit to run

        iii. Agreement must **touch** **and** **concern** the land

        iv. Requires **vertical** **privity**

            1.  Complete succession does not exist here; all you need is
                some non-hostile nexus between B1 and B2

4.  FOR EQUITABLE SERVITUDES: Figure out whether you need burden running
    or benefit running

    a.  In order for the BURDEN to run:

        i.  Writing

        ii. Intent

        iii. Touch and concern

        iv. Notice

    b.  In order for the BENEFIT to run:

        i.  Writing

        ii. Intent

        iii. Touch and concern

![](media/image5.png){width="0.0in" height="1.3888888888888888e-2in"}

I.  **Tulk** **v.** **Moxhay** **(1848)**-invents equitable servitudes

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** plaintiff was the owner in fee of a
        vacant piece of ground and several of the houses forming
        Leicester Square; plaintiff sold the piece of ground to Elms;
        the deed of conveyance contained a covenant by Elms to keep the
        grounds in good condition; defendant manifested an intention to
        alter the character of the garden and asserted a right to build
        upon it; plaintiff filed bill for injunction, which was granted
        to restrain defendant from converting or using the piece of
        ground

    b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** whether the agreement is enforceable
        under some other theory, when there was notice

    c.  **[Discussion:]{.underline}** real covenant was not in play here

        i.  Writing was satisfied

        ii. Agreement said it was explicitly to apply to "his heirs and
            assigns" so there was intent for it to run

        iii. It did touch and concern the land

        iv. Horizontal and vertical privity

            1.  Vertical-some non-hostile nexus between OG party and
                successor and complete succession of estatethere is
                this

            2.  Horizontal-only way to satisfy this at this time was to
                have a landlord/tenant relationship (a lease); sales did
                not qualify (grantor/grantee did not count)

                a.  This was a SALE, not a LEASENO HORIZONTAL PRIVITY

        v.  There was notice

    d.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** this will be enforceable despite the
        lack of horizontal privity because the person took with notice;
        this court created the equitable servitude to get around
        problems with horizontal privity

    e.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** policy justifications to not let
        the guy get away with building

        i.  If the court didn't issue an injunction, it would be
            impossible for an owner of land to sell part of it without
            incurring the risk of what he retains worthless (if you own
            the land yourself you can control what happens on it)

        ii. If the person had notice, then it should be enforceable

        iii. The cost of complying with the burdensome covenant was
             priced into the defendant's purchase price (unjust
             enrichment)

             1.  If the burden is lifted, you paid a low price to get a
                 thing that is now worth a whole lot more

             2.  If the defendant is relieved of the burden of complying
                 with restriction, then the defendant is going to enjoy
                 a windfall and will have paid a lower price to receive
                 something worth much more (they have their cake and eat
                 it too)

II. **Neponsit** **Property** **Owners'** **Ass'n.** **v.** **Emigrant**
    **Bank** **(1938)**- touch and concern element is easy to satisfy

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** residential subdivision with HOA;
        original sale had an affirmative covenant to pay money---dues to
        the HOA which would in turn be used to develop the area;
        defendant had purchased property in the area from one of the OG
        purchasers, but the bank didn't want to pay the HOA fees;
        plaintiff sued for not paying the dues

    b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** whether the covenant binds
        successors

    c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** the covenant may properly be said to
        touch and concern the land of the defendant and its burden
        should run with the land

        i.  The covenant satisfies touch and concern because the OG
            conveyance didn't just give title, but also gave an
            easement/right of common enjoyment

        ii. Even though the things being paid for aren't actually on the
            land, defendant gets to enjoy the benefit of those by virtue
            of owning the land

    d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** covenant was for things that were
        done in connection with the land but weren't done on the land

        i.  None of what the dues paid for actually occurred on
            defendant's land

        ii. What does touch and concern mean?

            1.  The covenant must affect the party's advantages and
                burdens as owners of particular parcels rather than as
                just part of the community

    e.  [**Test** **for** **if** **something** **touches** **and**
        **concerns:**]{.underline} does the covenant impose, on the one
        hand, a burden upon an interest in land, which on the other hand
        increases the value of a different interest in the same or
        related land

    f.  **[Takeaway:]{.underline}** there is a broad range of things
        that will satisfy touch and concern

III. **Sanborn** **v.** **McLean** **(1925)**-notice requirement

     a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** married couple wanted to build a gas
         station on their land; plaintiffs were neighbors of the McLeans
         trying to prevent the erection of the gas station; when the
         subdivision was divided there was a covenant that limited the
         lots to residential use only; problem was that the covenant was
         not included on all the deeds, and the defendant's deeds was
         one of those deeds that lacked the covenant; court refers to
         this as a reciprocal negative easement

     b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** does this negative covenant run
         with the land? Did the McLeans have notice even if the covenant
         wasn't included in the deed

     c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** the McLeans had constructive notice

     d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** because of the uniformity of the
         parcels, the defendant was under inquiry notice and should have
         done more

> ---should have noticed the uniformity and should have checked the
> records of neighboring parcels

i.  There was not record notice, but there was inquiry notice

    1.  Uniformity of compliance---everyone was doing it; there was a
        general plan and the deeds were restricted to carry out the plan

    2.  The plan was repeatedly declared for subsequent sale of the lots

    3.  The defendant is the first party to depart from the plan in 30
        years

<!-- -->

e.  **[Takeaway:]{.underline}** notice does not have to be actual notice

### [**Termination** **of** **Covenants**]{.underline}

I.  Negotiate a release amongst the parties to the covenant

II. Abandonment of the covenant

    a.  **Peckham** **v.** **Milroy** **(2001)**

        i.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** housing subdivision with a covenant
            that prohibited the use of lots for business purposes;
            Milroy was operating a daycare in the subdivision; the
            children were loud, which annoyed Peckham; Peckham
            complained but Milroy didn't do anything; Peckham sued,
            seeking an injunction; Milroy argued that public policy
            favored childcare

        ii. **[Question:]{.underline}** was the covenant abandoned on
            account of the prior violations?

        iii. **[Holding:]{.underline}** the covenant was not abandoned
             on account of the prior violations; the daycare was
             enjoined; Peckham won

        iv. **[Rationale:]{.underline}** violations were not habitual
            and substantial/requirements were not satisfied

            1.  Abandonment via prior violations requires that the prior
                violations have all three of the following

                a.  Violations have eroded the general plan; and

                b.  Violations must have been habitual and substantial;
                    and

                c.  Violations would therefore make enforcement
                    inequitable

III. Changed circumstances

     a.  **Bolotin** **v.** **Rindge** **(1964)**

         i.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** subdivision in a neighborhood had
             a covenant that limited property to single family
             residences and it was set to expire in 1970; plaintiff
             owned an unimproved lot in the subdivision and wanted to
             put up a commercial building and didn't want to be bound by
             the covenant; plaintiff's expert testified that the lot was
             unsuitable for single family residences and that the
             highest and best use of the property would be for
             commercial buildings; defense's expert said a commercial
             building would make the neighbor's building much less
             valuable and less desirable; trial court found that changed
             use nearby had left the lot with no substantial value for
             single family residences, but if used for commercial
             buildings it would be worth a lot and that refusal to
             enforce the covenant wouldn't adversely affect the market
             value of neighbor's property

         ii. **[Holding:]{.underline}** reversed and remanded; trial
             court needs to determine whether neighbors would suffer
             non-market value losses

         iii. **[Rule:]{.underline}** deed restrictions will be deemed
              unenforceable by reason of changed circumstances if either
              of the following is true

              1.  Changed conditions have raised the restriction's
                  purpose obsolete; OR

              2.  When enforcement of the covenant has all of the
                  following

                  a.  Enforcement would be inequitable; and

                  b.  Enforcement would harass the burdened party; and

                  c.  Enforcement would not benefit adjoining land
                      owners

         iv. **[Rationale:]{.underline}** neither of the above is
             satisfied here

             1.  Important to distinguish between market value and
                 comfort and enjoyment of neighbors

                 a.  Correct test is not whether neighbors would have a
                     lower market value, but whether the neighbors would
                     lose any benefit (the benefit the neighbors would
                     receive)

> **Nuisance-**addressing conflicts once they've arisen (ex post)

I.  **Campbell** **v.** **Seaman** **(1876)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** plaintiffs owned 40 acres of land and
        had owned it since 1849; they built an extensive house on their
        land and improved their land; defendant had owned adjoining
        lands which he used as a brickyard, but was not burning bricks
        from 1840 to 1853; defendant would burn bricks on his land,
        which emitted certain gasses that are destructive to some kinds
        of trees and vines; evidence showed that the gas from
        defendant's kilns had killed the foliage on plaintiff's trees;
        gas didn't continually escape, and it was carried into and over
        plaintiff's land only when the wind was from the south

        i.  Campbell bought his land at a time when Seaman was not
            burning bricks, and he built his house at a time when Seaman
            was not burning bricks

    b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** plaintiff wins; this was a nuisance

    c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}**

        i.  General discussion of nuisance

            1.  [**General** **rule:**]{.underline} every person may
                exercise exclusive dominion over his own property and
                may use it as will best serve his private interest

                a.  Limited by *sic* *utere* principal-use what's yours
                    so as not to damage others

                b.  *Sic* *utere* doesn't prohibit ALL injuries to
                    others, because other people would be compensated by
                    all the advantaged of civilized

> society---if one lives in the city, he must expect to suffer the dirt,
> smoke, noise, odors, and confusion incident to city life

2.  The rule is really that land owners must make a reasonable use of
    his property so as to occasion no unnecessary damage or annoyance to
    his neighbor

3.  What is reasonable? dependent upon circumstances

    a.  **Locality** **rule-**use of the property in one locality and
        under some circumstances may be lawful and reasonable, which
        under other circumstances, would be unlawful, unreasonable, and
        a nuisance (look at what's going on in the neighborhood)

    b.  **How** **much** **harm** **is** **happening**to constitute a
        nuisance, the use must be such as to produce a tangible or
        appreciable injury to the neighboring property, or such as to
        render its enjoyment [specially]{.underline} uncomfortable or
        inconvenient (is the use intermittent? Some intermittent uses
        may still be nuisances if they're often enough)

<!-- -->

ii. Possible defenses if prima facie case of nuisance is established

    1.  **"Coming** **to** **the** **nuisance"** **defense**-if the
        plaintiff complaining of nuisance showed up on the scene after
        the objectionable activity had already started, then the
        plaintiff would not be able to prevail

        a.  This court rejects this defense---if you own property, you
            are not allowed to control a future neighbor's use

    2.  **Estoppel/acquiescence**-you should have said something before,
        and since you didn't object you're estopped from bringing this
        claim

    3.  **Prescriptive** **easement**-could get one to permit you to do
        something on someone's property that you otherwise wouldn't;
        could have an easement to commit a nuisance

        a.  This court rejected this defense, saying it's not satisfied
            here because there was no continuity; the use was
            interrupted

    4.  No defense applies in this case, so it is a non- defensible
        nuisance

iii. Is injunctive relief available?

     1.  Campbell wanted injunction to stop the brickwork

     2.  Other remedy would be money damages

     3.  The injury is irreparable by damages---the jury can't assess a
         price for beauty and luxury; plaintiff can't be compensated in
         money for his loss

     4.  Injunctions may be denied on the basis of balance of hardships

         a.  But if the balance of hardships counts against it, then you
             can't

             i.  If injunction would be excessively burdensome on the
                 defendant in light of a relatively small benefit to
                 plaintiff, then the court nominates the injunction

             ii. There is no inordinate harm to society by limiting the
                 brickmaking activity

<!-- -->

II. **Adams** **v.** **Cleveland-Cliffs** **Iron** **Company**
    **(1999)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** lawsuit by residents who lived in the
        vicinity of a mining operation; residents complained of physical
        (plumbing leaks), emotional (sleeplessness and nervousness), and
        financial harms (diminished home resale value); dust, noise, and
        vibrations were the intrusions

    b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** are those claims trespass or
        nuisance?

    c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** this is a nuisance rather than a
        trespass; there was no trespass

    d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** requirements of trespass were not
        satisfied

        i.  Distinction between trespass and nuisance

            1.  [Trespass:]{.underline} invasion of property that
                both (1) is done by a physical, tangible object, and (2)
                is direct (no intervening force that has caused the
                thing to go onto the property)

                a.  Even if it's negligible injury, you'll at least get
                    nominal damages

            2.  [Nuisance:]{.underline} balancing test based on the
                social value of activities (how beneficial is the
                activity)

                a.  In order to get damages for nuisance, have to show
                    actual and substantial injury

        ii. Applying trespass:

            1.  Directness satisfied if the invasion occurs by any means
                that the defendant knew or should have known would
                result in physical invasion of the plaintiff's land
                \[**DIFFERENT** **FROM** **CAMPBELL** **DIRECTNESS\]**

                a.  It is enough if you have knowledge to a substantial
                    certainty that your activity will result in the
                    entrance of foreign matter

            2.  Tangible object requirement not satisfied

                a.  Dust is not a significant physical intrusion

III. **Boomer** **v.** **Atlantic** **Cement** **Company,** **Inc.**
     **(1970)**

     a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** defendant operated a large cement
         plant; actions for injunction and damages by neighboring land
         owners alleging injury to property from dirt, smoke, and
         vibration emanating from the plant; injunction denied a trial;
         plaintiff sued defendant; court said plaintiff had entitlement

     b.  [**Entitlement** **Protected** **Through:**]{.underline}
         liability rule protectionhomeowner is required to accept money
         damages in exchange for dealing with the nuisance

     c.  [**Traditional** **New** **York** **Rule** **on**
         **Injunctions:**]{.underline} nuisances shall be enjoinedCOURT
         DOES NOT FOLLOW THIS RULE

     d.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** plaintiff awarded permanent damages

     e.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** grounded in liability rule
         protection to give the factory an easement to continue doing
         the nuisance

         i.  Balances effects of granting injunction

             1.  Total damage to plaintiff is relatively small compared
                 to the value of the defendant's operation

             2.  An injunction would be costly

         ii. Transaction cost

             1.  If low, consensual exchange is possible, so use a
                 property rule protection because it promotes efficiency

             2.  If high, things get complicated, so may be more
                 efficient to switch to liability rule protection and
                 have court step in

         iii. Two alternatives to granting immediate injunction

              1.  Grant injunction but postpone effects for a fixed
                  period of timeREJECTED BY THIS COURT because you
                  don't know technology will get to the point it needs
                  to be at

              2.  Grant injunction unless defendant pays permanent
                  damages compensating plaintiff for present and future
                  costsACCEPTED BY THIS COURT

> **Zoning-**government regulations

I.  Two ways to avoid being inconvenienced by zoning

    a.  Seek a special exception-carve out in the ordinance itself

    b.  Seek a variance-exception for hardship

II. **Non-conforming** **uses**-when a zoning ordinance is enacted on
    areas that are already developed, then an issue arises of what
    happens to things that are already there but are noncompliant with
    the new zoning laws

    a.  Those uses are allowed to continue as non-conforming uses

    b.  Only existing USES are protected, not existing LOTS

    c.  Not allowed to switch uses if you're a non-conforming use

III. **Amortization**-phases out non-conforming use after a specified
     period of time

IV. Concerns with zoning

    a.  Danger of rent-seeking: economic rents, lobbying to get a
        benefit for yourself

        i.  Because zoning is administered through a central authority,
            those people with more political power/influence

> are likely to be able to benefit from zoning more than people who lack
> political power/influence

b.  Concern about capture: government entities can be captured by the
    organizations they're regulating

<!-- -->

V.  **Village** **of** **Euclid** **v.** **Ambler** **Realty** **Co.**
    **(1926)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Euclid had use zones that were
        **cumulative**-permissible to engage in that particular use, as
        well as any particular use that was less intensive; cumulative
        zoning defines a hierarchy of uses, from the least invasive to
        the most invasive; Amber Realty sought a declaration that the
        zoning restrictions were invalid

        i.  U1: single family homes, public parks, et. al only

        ii. U2: duplexes

        iii. U3: apartments, schools, churches, hotels, museums,
             hospitals, etc.

        iv. U4: banks, offices, restaurants, theaters, retail stores,
            gas stations, fire and police stations

        v.  U5: warehouses, billboards, laundries, auto repair shops,
            wholesale produce markets

        vi. U6: industrial, cemeteries, prisons

    b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** at least some zoning regulations are
        permissible; zoning is constitutional

    c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** it will be constitutional unless it
        is clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial
        relationship to public health, safety, morals, and general
        welfare

    d.  **[Takeaway:]{.underline}** zoning is constitutional

    e.  [**Cumulative** **Zoning:**]{.underline}

        i.  U1 by itself

        ii. Anything from U1 can be put in U2

        iii. Anything from U1 and U2 can be put in U3

        iv. Anything from U1, U2, and U3 can be put in U4

        v.  Anything from U1, U2, U3, and U4 can be put in U5

        vi. Anything from U1, U2, U3, U4, and U5 can be put in U6

### [**Exclusionary** **Zoning**]{.underline}

I.  Zoning that is implicitly motivated by discriminatory purposes or
    that has discriminatory effects

II. Example: the zoning in Euclid had an effect on the demographics of
    the neighborhood

III. Zoning ordinances that impose minimum lot sizes

     a.  Lowers density of houses

     b.  Has effect of making neighborhood more expensive, which affects
         who can live there

IV. Can be downstream effects to various social groups that aren't
    obvious on the face of the ordinance

V.  **Southern** **Burlington** **County** **N.A.A.C.P.** **v.**
    **Township** **of** **Mount** **Laurel** **(1975)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** town explicitly wanted to be
        economically discriminatory; zoning ordinance had restrictions
        on what kind of houses could be built; only houses that could
        not accommodate bigger families/low-income people were built

    b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** the city is required to make a
        variety of housing realistically possible; there's a presumptive
        obligation not to make housing impossible for low- and
        middle-income people

    c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** every municipality must bear its
        "fair share" of the housing burden

    d.  **[Takeaway:]{.underline}** zoning can have knock-on effects
        that are socially bad

# [**Dividing** **Ownership** **Across** **Persons** **and**]{.underline} **[Time]{.underline}**

I.  **Estate**-property rights defined in terms of their duration
    through time

> **Present** **Possessory** **Interests-an** **interest** **that**
> **gives** **you** **a** **right** **to** **possess** **in** **the**
> **present**

I.  **Fee(s)** **simple** **absolute**-largest package of ownership
    rights

    a.  If you transfer property and don't specify otherwise, it's
        presumed to be a fee simple absolute

    b.  Indefinite in time; runs to infinity

    c.  Granted by language such as "to Jones..."

    d.  "to Jones and his heirs" = "to Jones" (alive people do not have
        heirs)

II. **Life** **estate**-an interest that gives you a right currently to
    possess a property

    a.  Terminates automatically upon the death of a named person

    b.  Can be transferred by gift or by sale

        i.  If transferred, it's a situation of **life** **estate**
            ***pur*** ***autre*** ***vie***- a life estate that's
            measured by someone other than the person who holds it

            1.  If A transfers life estate to B, the duration of the
                life estate is measured by A's life

III. **Defeasible** **fees**-allow ownership to change if some specified
     event occurs; whether the event will ever actually occur or is
     uncertain; if the event occurs, (1) who gets it, and (2) will the
     transfer occur automatically or at the discretion of the other
     party

     a.  **Fee** **simple** **determinable**-ends automatically if a
         named event occurs; if event occurs, then automatically the
         interest goes back to original grantor

         i.  Created using DURATIONAL LANGUAGE (i.e. "as long as",
             "while", "until")

     b.  **Fee** **simple** **subject** **to** **a** **condition**
         **subsequent**-continues indefinitely until a named event
         occurs; if even occurs, it does not automatically end, but
         rather the original grantor can choose to end it, either via
         self-help or lawsuit; terminated only if triggering event
         occurs and if the person chooses to exercise the right to
         retake it

         i.  Created using CONDITIONAL LANGUAGE (i.e. "but if" "on
             condition that" "unless")

     c.  **Fee** **simple** **subject** **to** **executory**
         **limitation**-if the triggering event occurs, the possessor
         right doesn't go back to OG grantor but instead goes to some
         third party; appears to work automatically

         i.  Created using DURATIONAL or CONDITIONAL LANGUAGE ( i.e. "to
             X, but if X ever does A, it goes to Z")

> **Future** **Interests**

I.  Reversionary interests (in original grantor)

    a.  **Reversion**-if there's a grant to A for life, then when A dies
        the life estate goes back to OG grantor (so the OG grantor has a
        reversion)

    b.  **Possibility** **of** **reverter**-follows every fee simple
        determinable, and only fee simple determinable; returns
        possession to grantor, either explicitly or implicitly

        i.  Implicit if the grantor of the fee simple determinable
            doesn't say what happens when the event occurs

        ii. Reverter happens automatically if the triggering event
            occurs

    c.  **Right** **of** **entry** **(power** **of**
        **termination)**-original grantor can choose to let the former
        possessor stay there; gives OG grantor the right, but not the
        obligation, to retake possession if the triggering event occurs

II. In other people

    a.  **Remainder**-for life estates; "to A for life, then to B"B has
        a remainder in fee simple absolute

        i.  Remainders themselves can be any form of one of the present
            possessory interests

        ii. Remainder in

        iii. "To A for life, then to B for life, then to C"life estate
             in A, remainder in life estate to B, remainder in fee
             simple to C

    b.  **Executory** **interest**-for fee simple subject to executory
        limitation

### [**Conflicts** **Over** **Time**]{.underline}

> **Waste-**key is whether the DAMAGE caused the property is excessive,
> not the ACT

I.  Three types of waste

    a.  **Affirmative** **waste**-doing something that's a bad action on
        the property; present possessory interest person does a bad use;
        a non-normal use that causes "excess" damage

    b.  **Permissive** **waste**-not acting when you should have acted;
        present possessory interest person doesn't act; unreasonable
        failure to act that causes "excess" damage

    c.  **Ameliorative** **waste**-significant change in the property
        that actually increases the value of the property

II. Waste occurs only when you have a division of interest in a
    particular piece of property across time

    a.  One person has a present possessory interest and one person has
        a future interest

    b.  No division of interest across time  no waste

III. **Brokaw** **v.** **Fairchild** **(1929)**-ameliorative waste

     a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Brokaw had four mansions and gave each
         of his four kids a life estate in one of the mansions; each
         life estate had a remainder in each life tenant's kids; if a
         kid didn't have kids,

> then the interest would go to the other grandchildren; no one wanted
> to rent out the property that was given to George, and George was
> paying a lot of money for the property; George wanted to knock the
> mansion down and build apartments instead; George sued, seeking
> declaratory judgment saying he was entitled to knock down the
> building; George's siblings resisted and said knocking down the
> building would be waste; George's argument was that the value of the
> property would increase if he were to knock the house down and put in
> apartment buildings

b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** George was not allowed to knock the
    mansion down; the will clearly intended for the residence to be part
    of the life estate, and the residence would no longer exist if it
    were to be replaced by apartments

c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** the life estate was in the residence

    i.  [**General** **rule:**]{.underline} a life tenant may do
        whatever is required for the general use and enjoyment of his
        estate; the use of the estate he received is contemplated and
        not the exercise of an act of dominion or ownership

        1.  You have the right to use, but not the rights of an owner

        2.  The property must pass to the remaindermen as nearly as
            practicable unimpaired in its nature and improvements,
            otherwise it's waste

    ii. Even though ameliorative waste makes the property value better,
        it still may be formal waste that can be prohibited

    iii. The law allows a life tenant to enjoy his estate in a
         reasonable manner that when passed to the remaindermen it is
         unimpaired in its nature, character, and improvements

### [**Restraints** **on** **Alienation**]{.underline}

I.  Absolute restraints on alienation are void against public policy

II. **Mountain** **Brow** **Lodge** **No.** **82,** **Independent**
    **Order** **of** **Odd** **Fellows** **v.** **Toscano** **(1967)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Toscano's gave a lot to the Odd Fellows
        lodge, provided that the lot would revert back to them if either
        the lodge sold or transferred any part of it, or if the Odd
        Fellows stopped using it for the lodge purposes

        i.  First limitation is an INVALID ABSOLUTE RESTRAINTmakes it
            VOID

        ii. Second limitation is what was at issue; Odd Fellows argues
            that it was an absolute restraint

    b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** it was a valid fee simple subject to
        a condition subsequent

    c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** intent of grantors was that the
        lodge be used for lodge purposes, so it was okay for them to
        include a condition that if the lodge stopped being used for
        lodge purposes, it would revert back to them

### **Four** **Types** **of** **Concurrent** **Interests** **(co-ownership)**

1.  **Tenancy** **in** **common[^1^](#_heading=h.gjdgxs)**-each tenant
    has an undivided interest in the property, so each has a right to
    possess the whole

    a.  Interests are separate, so each interest is independently
        alienable (A can sell/alienate in any way without B's
        permission)

    b.  Shares do not have to be equal, which means tenants could have
        unequal responsibilities

    c.  Co-tenants in common have no property rights against each other

        i.  Cannot demand rent from each other, because every co-tenant
            has equal right to possess the whole

2.  **Joint** **tenancy**-similar to tenancy in common in many ways, but
    there are three main differences

    a.  Joint tenancy has a [right of survivorship]{.underline}when one
        joint tenant dies, his interest vanishes, and every other joint
        tenant's interest in creases proportionately (survivors have a
        right to the deceased tenant's share)

    b.  Requires four unities

        i.  [Possession]{.underline}-each must have the right to possess
            the whole

        ii. [Time]{.underline}-everyone had to have gotten their joint
            tenancy share at the same time

        iii. [Title]{.underline}-everyone got their ownership share via
             the same instrument

        iv. [Interest]{.underline}-each must have the same legal
            interest in the property, such as fee simple, life estate,
            lease, etc.

    c.  Shares are the exact same size---if you have three tenants, each
        tenant must have 1/3 of a share

3.  **Tenancy** **by** **the** **entirety**-for married couples only;
    holdover from the fact that under common law, married women were not
    allowed to own property in their own name

    a.  Similar to joint tenancy: right of survivorship, have to satisfy
        four unities (in most states)

    b.  Marriage is a unit, so the property belongs to the unit

    c.  Neither spouse can unilaterally transfer the property that's
        held by the tenancy by the entirety (cannot transfer interest
        unilaterally)

    d.  Can transfer it only if the other spouse agreesdifferent from
        joint tenancy

> []{#_heading=h.gjdgxs .anchor}1 NO FURTHER SPECIFICATIONSpresumed to
> be a TENANCY IN COMMON

4.  **Community** **property**-found in some states, mainly in the
    south/west

    a.  Alternative to tenancy by entirety (a state will have one or the
        other, but not both)

    b.  All the property that's acquired during a marriage automatically
        becomes community property

    c.  Equal right to possess

    d.  Alienation requires consent of both spouses

    e.  If spouses divorce, community property is divided equally,
        unless one spouse can show that it was separate property

### **Issues** **Arising** **Between** **Co-Tenants**

I.  In the case of FUTURE INTERESTS, court addresses this through the
    DOCTRINE OF WASTE

II. In the case of CONCURRENT INTERESTS, courts generally will not
    intervene to sort out cotenant's conduct

    a.  Waste generally disfavored with respect to concurrent owners

    b.  Instead, available remedy is partition

III. **Partition**-if you don't like the relationship, you can get out
     of it

     a.  Cotenants have automatic right of partition---they can leave
         the co-ownership AT ANY TIME, FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR NO REASON
         AT ALL

IV. How co-tenancies are regulated

    a.  Threat of exit- "I will stop being in this cotenancy unless you
        stop"

    b.  Have a contract between two people

### **Partition**

I.  **Delfino** **v.** **Vealencis** **(1980)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** parcel is co-owned and there will be a
        partition; Vealencis's interest was 31% in the property, V lived
        on the property and owned a business on the property; V wanted
        partition in kind; Delfino wanted to eventually build a
        residential subdivision on the property, so he wanted partition
        by sale

    b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** will the partition be partition by
        sale or partition in kind?

    c.  [**Two** **kinds** **of** **partition:**]{.underline}

        i.  **Partition** **by** **sale**-property sold at auction,
            money earned divided amongst former co-tenants proportionate
            to their interest in the property

            1.  Former co-owners end up with MONEY

            2.  Might be a trend toward partition in sale, but an effect
                would be requiring people living on the property to move
                out; there would be other social costs that could make
                this avenue less optimal

        ii. **Partition** **in** **kind**-physically/legally dividing
            property itself, so one party gets one part of property and
            the other party gets the other part of the property

            1.  Former co-owners end up with PARTS OF THE PROPERTY and
                will own their parts by themselves

            2.  Most states today favor partition in kind

    <!-- -->

    a.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** partition in kind is granted

    b.  **[Rule:]{.underline}** the policy is to favor partition in kind
        unless both of the following are satisfied

        i.  Dividing in kind would be impracticable or inequitable, AND

        ii. Selling the property would better serve all the owners'
            interests

    c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** both being required makes them
        jointly sufficient and individually necessary, but the
        discussion seems to say that either one would be sufficient; the
        controlling rule, however, is that both are fully required

        i.  Practicability of dividing the lot:

            1.  Physical partition is feasible and building the
                subdivision is still possible even with the garbage
                facility present

        ii. Owner interest:

            1.  Delfino might lose market value by having the garbage
                facility next door, but they are not the only party
                whose interest is at stake

            2.  It may well be in Vealencis' interest---she was there
                for a long time, her livelihood is there

            3.  As a result, only one of the owner's interest would be
                satisfied, and the requirement is that ALL owners
                interests are satisfied

    d.  **Owelty**-a payment to correct an imbalance that arises from
        partitioning in kind

### **Contribution** **and** **Accounting**

I.  Under some circumstances, cotenants can receive damages against
    another tenant

II. **Gillmor** **v.** **Gillmor** **(1984)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** tenancy in common; one tenant used land
        for grazing and excluded the other tenant from doing the same
        thing because if both tenants used the land for grazing it would
        be over grazed; this was not allowed; the tenant in possession
        had planned to go to court to seek an injunction against the
        tenant who was being wrongfully excluded; the barred tenant had
        a right to graze in the land

    b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** an accounting and damages are
        awarded, contribution was necessary

    c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}**

        i.  [Accounting issue:]{.underline} if a cotenant is ousted from
            possession, the ousted cotenant can sue for his share of the
            profits

### **Severance**

1.  Applies ONLY with an **ouster**

2.  To show an ouster, the mere fact that the other party used the
    property isn't enough, even if that other party is the only party to
    use the property, because every tenant has a right to use the
    property has long as the party that's using it doesn't interfere
    with the other party's rights

3.  Ouster is only applicable when one party actively excludes another
    party

4.  Here, there was an ouster

    a.  Clear unequivocal demand, combined with refusal to accommodate
        cotenants right to use

        i.  [Contribution issue:]{.underline} if a cotenant who
            possesses property unilaterally decides to make
            repairs/improvements to property, cotenant who makes
            improvements cannot demand that the other cotenant help pay
            for them

            1.  Exceptions:

                a.  If cotenant in possession who made the repairs did
                    so in a good faith belief that they were the sole
                    owner of the property

                b.  A cotenant who is out of possession but knew that
                    the cotenant in possession was making changes and
                    yet kept quiet about it even though they didn't
                    approveestoppel would step in

                c.  If the repairs were necessary in order to
                    preserve/protect the co-owned property

            2.  Defendant seeking contribution for a fence

                a.  Court says he can get contribution if the fence was
                    necessary and the expense was reasonable

                b.  Here, there can be contribution because it was a
                    necessary expense

<!-- -->

I.  Converts a joint tenancy into a tenancy in common

II. Partition takes joint tenancy/tenancy in common and converts into
    separate fees

    a.  Severance, by contract, doesn't eliminate co-ownership

<!-- -->

III. Either joint tenant can unilaterally sever a joint tenancy in
     common

### **Severance**=START WITH JOINT TENANCY, END WITH TENANCY IN COMMON

V.  **Partition**=START WITH EITHER, END UP WITH SEPARATE OWNERSHIP

VI. **Harms** **v.** **Sprague** **(1984)**-right of survivorship

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** plaintiff Harms filed a complaint to
        quiet title and for declaratory judgment in the circuit court;
        plaintiff had taken title to certain real estate with his
        brother John as a joint tenant, with full right of survivorship;
        plaintiff named defendant Sprague as the executor of the estate
        of John and the devisee of all the real and personal property of
        John; defendant filed a counterclaim against plaintiff,
        challenging plaintiff's claim of ownership of the entire tract
        of property and asking the court to recognize defendant's
        interest as a tenant in common, subject to a mortgage lien

        i.  John and William had property in a joint tenancy; John
            borrowed money via a mortgage on the property from Simmons;
            John's will left his share of the property to Sprague; John
            died; if this is still a joint tenancy, William would end up
            with the property and Sprague would get nothing; but if the
            mortgage to Simmons severed the joint tenancy, then John and
            William at that point owned simply as tenants in common, who
            do not have a right of survivorship, so John's interest
            would go to Sprague; William sued to quiet title to get a
            declaratory judgment that William actually owned the
            property

    b.  [**Trial** **Court** **Holding:**]{.underline} the mortgage lien
        given by John to defendants Carl and Mary Simmons severed the
        joint tenancy; the mortgage survived the death of John as a lien
        against the undivided one-half interest in the property which
        passed to Sprague by and through the will of the deceased

    c.  [**Appellate** **Court:**]{.underline} reversed, finding that
        the mortgage given by one joint tenant of his interest in the
        property doesn't sever the joint tenancy; held that plaintiff,
        as surviving joint tenant, owned the property in its entirety,
        unencumbered by the mortgage lien

    d.  **[Question:]{.underline}** 1) does a mortgage by one joint
        tenancy sever the joint tenancy? 2) does the mortgage survive
        the mortgager's death as a lien?

    e.  **[Holding:]{.underline}**

        i.  1\) no, destroying one of the four unities would sever the
            joint tenancy, so if John had [sold]{.underline} his
            interest to Simmons, that would have severed the joint
            tenancy, but mortgage doesn't involve transfers in this way;
            this does not sever joint tenancySprague loses

        ii. 2\) the mortgage is not still in play as a lien, this was a
            lien on John's interest; when John died, his interest
            vanished, and Williams' interest increased proportionally;
            once that interest was gone, there was nothing left securing
            the mortgageSimmons loses

    f.  **[Upshot:]{.underline}** a unilateral mortgage does not sever
        joint tenancies; liens/mortgages do not convey title so they do
        not sever joint tenancy

        i.  If the joint tenancy is severed, then it goes into a common

        ii. Here, the joint tenancy remained intact so therefore the
            interest died with the one brother and invalidated the
            mortgage/lien on the title

# **[Leases]{.underline}**

I.  Leases transfer possession, so you have a right to exclude

    a.  Different from license or easement, which only convey RIGHTS TO
        USE

II. [**Recurring** **theme:**]{.underline} allocation of risk in
    situations in which there are asymmetries of information and
    asymmetries in the ability to control between landlords and tenants

### **Four** **Types** **of** **Leases** **at** **Common** **Law**

1.  **Term** **of** **years**-lease that ends on a specified date in
    time; need not be for more than one year

    a.  If more than one year, typically has to be in writing

    b.  Because it ends automatically, neither party has to give notice
        to end it

2.  **Periodic** **tenancy**-automatically roll over for some specified
    period of time, usually one month or one year; month-to-month

    a.  Either party may terminate, but termination usually requires
        advanced notice

3.  **Tenancy** **at** **will**-can be terminated by either party at any
    time for any reason

    a.  Many jurisdictions usually require advanced notice

4.  **Tenancy** **at** **sufferance**-arises when the lease ends and a
    tenant just doesn't leave

    a.  Different from trespasser because a trespasser never had
        permission to go onto the property, where a tenant at sufferance
        did have permission at first

    b.  Landlord has the right to object but may not be able to use
        self- help

<!-- -->

I.  **Paradine** **v.** **Jane** **(1647)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** landlord leased agricultural land to a
        tenant for a term of years; tenant couldn't get out earlier
        because it was a term of years; the English Civil War happened,
        where an alien army ousted the tenant from possession of the
        property; tenant stopped paying rent; landlord sued

    b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** ouster is irrelevant and tenant still
        had to pay rent

    c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** two arguments

        i.  1\) relationship between the covenants that the landlord and
            tenant gave each other

            1.  Landlord gave covenant of quiet enjoyment-promise that
                the landlord would not displace the tenant during the
                lease

            2.  Tenant gave landlord covenant to pay rent

            3.  The two covenants are independent of each otherfailure
                to fulfill one covenant does not exclude nonperformance
                of the other

            4.  Remedy for breach of covenant is to sue

            5.  Even though the tenant had stopped paying rent, the
                landlord could still not lease the property to someone
                else because it would violate the covenant of quiet
                enjoyment

        ii. 2\) risk allocation

            1.  Tenant gets all the benefits of increased profits from
                the land and all the landlord gets is the fixed rent, so
                the same thing should be true if the tenant has low
                profits![](media/image6.jpg){width="5.057317366579178in"
                height="3.32in"}

                a.  Tenant should bear the risk of lower profits

        iii. Asymmetric information and control are both in favor of the
             tenant here, so it makes more sense for the tenant to bear
             the risk

II. **Smith** **v.** **McEnany** **(1897)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** landlord leased land to a tenant; there
        was a shed on the land; later, there was a minor encroachment by
        the landlord when he built a wall on the tenant's leasehold; the
        landlord built the wall knowing it was encroaching; the tenant
        was slightly displaced, so they stopped paying rent; the
        landlord sued; the tenant also gave the landlord a covenant to
        repair the shed

    b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** held for tenant; tenant not required
        to pay rent while the encroachment is ongoing; tenant is still
        obligated to comply with the covenant to repair the shed because
        it independent of covenant of quiet enjoyment

    c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** the encroachment violated the
        covenant of quiet enjoyment, and that covenant is not
        independent of the covenant to pay rent

        i.  The two covenants are **dependent**; covenant to pay rent is
            conditional upon the landlord's compliance with the covenant
            of quiet enjoyment

        ii. It doesn't matter that the encroachment was small

        iii. No one would repair the shed if the tenant did not repair
             it, so the shed would deteriorate which is socially
             wastefullooks kind of like permissive waste

             1.  Makes sense that the covenant to repair would still be
                 enforceable

III. **Medico-Dental** **Building** **Company** **of** **Los**
     **Angeles** **v.** **Horton** **and** **Converse** **(1942)**

     a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** landlord agreed to a restrictive
         covenant in the lease that prohibited him for leasing space in
         the building to another drug selling company' landlord then
         leased the entire ninth floor to a big medical operation; among
         other things, this operation dispensed drugs; the lease allowed
         the doctor to dispense drugs as part of regular course of
         treatment of his own patients; the doctor's own patients are
         the same people that would have otherwise gone to Horton and
         Converse; H&C lost sales and stopped paying rent; Medico sued
         seeking rental payments

     b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** rejected argument that the lease was
         made of independent covenants; rejected argument that violating
         the covenant of not leasing to other drug dispensers was
         independent of the covenant to pay rent

         i.  There was a substantial breach because the intent of the
             parties showed that the covenants were intended to be
             dependent

     c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** look to the intent of the parties

         i.  Three things that show covenants were intended to be
             dependent

             1.  Both covenants were in a rider-an attachment to the
                 document that amends or supplements the document

             2.  Plain language of the agreement shows that they were
                 intended to be linked

             3.  Obvious that the subject matter of the covenant not to
                 lease to other drug dispensers was vital to H&C---
                 protection against competition was a material part of
                 the consideration that induced Horton to sign the lease

         ii. There was a substantial breach

         iii. Suggests that if the breach had been minor, court might
              have treated the covenants to be independent

     d.  [**Remedies** **available:**]{.underline}

         i.  Rescind the leaseH&C CHOSE THIS

         ii. Stay with the lease but sue for damages of lost profits
             from covenant violation

         iii. Rescind the lease and sue for damages they suffered
              between time of breach and time of rescission

IV. **Sutton** **v.** **Temple** **(1843)**-caveat lessee

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** lease of agricultural land; neither the
        landlord nor the tenant realized that the particular land had
        grass that was poisoned by paint; the lease had no explicit
        warranties in it

    b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** does the tenant still have to pay
        rent?

    c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** caveat lessee-even if the property is
        unsuitable, the tenant still must pay rent

    d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** there are no implied warranties of
        fitness

        i.  Arguably, the tenant has better knowledge of what the tenant
            will need than the landlord will, so the tenant will know
            what questions to ask to find out if the property will be
            suitable---burden of asking prospective questions is on the
            tenant

        ii. The tenant bears the risk that the property will turn out to
            be unsuitable for the tenant's purpose

V.  **Blackett** **v.** **Olanoff** **(1977)**-constructive eviction

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** landlord owned two properties that were
        near each other; rented a residence to tenant 1, and a space for
        a club nearby to tenant 2; the club was too loud so tenant 1
        left and claimed constructive eviction so they wouldn't have to
        pay rent on the remaining time of the lease

        i.  **Constructive** **eviction**-not really being evicted but
            being treated like you were; landlord doesn't kick someone
            out; you need BOTH a) for someone's conduct to substantially

> interfere with tenant's use and enjoyment, and b) the landlord must be
> able to be held responsible

1.  Generally, have to vacate within a reasonable period of time

<!-- -->

b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** the tenant was constructively evicted;
    tenant's implied warranty of quiet enjoyment was violated; the noise
    was the natural and probable consequence of allowing a club to rent
    the property, and the landlord could control the club tenant's music
    level

c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** it was clear that the conduct
    interfered with tenant's use and enjoyment, and the landlord could
    be held responsible

    i.  The landlord had control over knowing that the other tenant
        could create a nuisance and had control over quieting that
        nuisance

    ii. If the tenant bore the risk, what happens next? Violence?

    iii. Risk is better allocated to the landlord

<!-- -->

VI. **Gotlieb** **v.** **Taco** **Bell** **Corporation** **(1994)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Gotlieb leased property to TB; TB
        pledged to exercise diligence to get government approval to open
        the restaurant; TB was permitted to cancel the lease if they
        couldn't get government approval within six months; within a
        month of entering the lease, a campaign began to keep TB out of
        the location; TB offered to revise their plans and assuage the
        protesters; one day before the permitting period was supposed to
        expire, TB filed their permit application and served Gotlieb
        with a document that purported to repudiate the lease; Gotlieb
        rejected the repudiation; TB didn't pay the first rent payment

    b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** 1) what the tenant and landlord's
        options are; 2) how much rent is actually owed?

    c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** plaintiff is entitled to rent up
        until the termination of the contract and nothing after;
        landlord was deemed to have accepted a tenant surrender of the
        property, and as a result the tenant is not liable to pay rent
        for any period after the acceptance and surrender had occurred

    d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}**

        i.  Landlords have three options when tenants attempt to
            repudiate a lease before its expiration

            1.  Reject the repudiation and do nothingtenant still
                liable for rent

            2.  Accept the repudiation, re-enter and re-let the property
                to someone else for landlord's benefitoriginal lease is
                terminated, original tenant no longer owes any rent

            3.  Reject the repudiation, enter the premises, and re- let
                for the tenant's benefit (acting as the agent of

> the tenant)tenant remains liable for any difference in the rent from
> OG contract and the new rent

ii. Termination of estate by repudiation or surrender can occur in two
    different ways:

    1.  Either express agreement or by operation of law (explicitly or
        implicitly)

        a.  Express acceptance was not true here because Gotlieb
            explicitly rejected the repudiation

        b.  Implicit-if the parties do some act that is so inconsistent
            with the landlord/tenant relationship which implies their
            intent to terminate the relationship, that will constitute
            acceptance of repudiation

            i.  Can apply even if there's an outward refusal by landlord
                to accept the repudiation

iii. Gotlieb, after rejecting the repudiation, then negotiated and made
     a written offer to someone elsethis was more than a mere attempt,
     so as a result Gotlieb was deemed to have accepted the surrender

iv. How much rent does TB owe?

    1.  Liable for all rent between time rent started being due and when
        surrender was accepted

    2.  Once surrender was accepted, TB was off the hook

### **Duty** **to** **Mitigate**

I.  **Sommer** **v.** **Kridel** **(1977)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Kridel rents an apartment from Sommer;
        two-year lease starting in May for \$345/month; Kridel was
        planning to marry in June; Kridel had paid initial rent and
        security deposit but things changed so money was not coming in;
        Kridel notified Sommer of the changes and said he would not be
        renting; Sommer waited 16 months after receiving Kridel's notice
        and then re-leased the apartment; Sommer had turned down a
        prospective replacement earlier; Sommer sued, seeking 16 months
        of rent and one-month security deposit

    b.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** a landlord does have an obligation to
        make a reasonable effort to mitigate damages in such a
        situation; the landlord must take reasonable efforts to lease
        the property to someone else

    c.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** court overturned the old law; no
        viable distinction between a lease and an ordinary contract;
        treated this as a contract; there is a duty to mitigate a breach
        of contract

        i.  [Old law:]{.underline} landlords have no duty to mitigate,
            so the landlord is prohibited from exercising any control
            over the property while the lease is onOVERTURNED

    d.  **[Rule:]{.underline}** landlord bears the burden of showing
        that he exercised reasonable diligence in trying to re-lease the
        property, but the tenant is required to pay reasonable costs of
        doing so

![](media/image4.jpg){width="5.613205380577428in"
height="3.231353893263342in"}

- At the end of month three, there's an acceptance of surrender and
  landlord re-lets the property on the landlord's behalffor the
  remaining three months, the tenant owes NOTHING

  - When there's an acceptance of surrender, the tenant is out of the
    picture

- Suppose instead the landlord's re-letting was not an acceptance of
  surrender, but was rather re-letting on the tenant's behalffor the
  remaining three months, the tenant owes \$900

  - Tenant is on the hook for \$1000 a month, but for each of those
    months the tenant is getting the benefit of the \$700 coming in from
    the other tenant; so, the tenant has to make up the difference
    between what the new tenant is paying and what the original rent was

- Suppose that there is no duty to mitigate herefor months 1-3, the
  tenant owes \$3000

- Suppose that there is a duty to mitigate; a reasonable amount of time
  for the landlord to find a new tenant is one monthfor months 1-3,
  tenant owes \$1600

  - Duty to mitigate means that a landlord is obligated to have rented
    out the property; had the landlord fulfilled his duty to mitigate in
    months 2 and 3, the landlord didn't have a duty to mitigate in month
    1

  - Had the landlord been reasonably diligent in months 2 and 3, the
    replacement tenant would have paid \$700, but the original tenant
    owed \$1000, so there still would have been a \$300 gap in month 2
    and 3, which totals \$600

  - So, the tenant still owed the \$1000 for the first month, on top of
    the \$600

II. **Javins** **v.** **First** **National** **Realty** **Corp.**
    **(1970)**-invents implied warranty of habitability

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** content of warranty of habitability is
        determined by the local housing code; apartment complex in DC;
        tenants had stopped paying rent; they alleged violations of
        housing code and said they would not continue paying rent; no
        allegation that the premises were in bad shape when tenants
        originally rented them; all that's alleged is that the landlord
        won't repair the property

    b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** was there an implied warranty of
        habitability?

    c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** there is an implied warranty of
        habitability here

    d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** the old rule should be ditched that
        tenant is on the hook for all repairs

        i.  [Old rule:]{.underline} tenants have the burden to
            repairOVERRULED

        ii. Four rationales for conclusion:

            1.  Common law default rule that required tenants to make
                repairs no longer makes sense for three reasons

                a.  Today's city dweller is not good at repairing things

                b.  Modern housing is harder and more complex to repair

                c.  The modern tenant frequently moves/switches
                    apartments; as a result, the tenant cannot
                    internalize the full benefits of repairs

            2.  Landlord/tenant law should be consistent with consumer
                protection law

                a.  If this were a consumer good, the law does have an
                    implied warranty of fitness

            3.  There is unequal bargaining power in these situations
                for two reasons

                a.  Standardized form leases

                b.  Race and class discrimination

            4.  Poor housing hurts the entire city

                a.  What is the best solution to this? Shouldn't the
                    entire city then pay for better housing?

    e.  **[Upshot:]{.underline}** leases of urban dwelling units should
        be treated like any other contract

        i.  If the landlord has breached the implied warranty of
            habitability, the tenant doesn't have to pay rent

        ii. Implied warranty of habitability does NOT show up in
            commercial leases

        iii. While there is an implied warranty of habitability, there
             is no implied warranty of fitness

> **Eminent** **Domain**

#  **[Takings]{.underline}**

I.  Eminent domain is an implied attribute of sovereignty---a power that
    governments [must]{.underline} have merely by virtue of being a
    government

II. Forced exchange---government forces a property owner to relinquish
    his property in exchange for a sum of money chosen by the government

III. Economic justifications for eminent domain

     a.  Property markets are thin marketsfew sellers of real property
         at any given time

     b.  The owner of a piece of real property has a local monopoly; it
         is not possible to substitute another piece of property for
         that

     c.  Creates the potential for holdout problems

         i.  If a project requires acquiring large amount of property
             and there is no eminent domain, there is the potential that
             someone might choose to hold out (enormous bargaining
             leverage)

     d.  Because holdouts can hurt the public interest, it isn't optimal
         to say that if the government wants land it has to buy it

IV. **TWO** **REQUIREMENTS:**

    a.  **Must** **be** **for** **a** **PUBLIC** **USE,** **and**

    b.  **JUST** **COMPENSATION** **must** **be** **paid** **(fair**
        **market** **value** **of** **the** **taken**
        **property---what** **a** **willing** **buyer** **would**
        **pay** **a** **willing** **seller** **in** **cash)**

V.  **Kelo** **v.** **City** **of** **New** **London,** **Connecticut**
    **(2005)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** taking of property from a private owner
        to give to another private company as part of a public economic
        development project; CT had a plan to do an urban development
        project that was supposed to attract a bunch of business to
        drive up the city's tax revenue; Kelo refused to sell her land
        to the city; the government decided then to just take it; Kelo
        challenged as an unconstitutional taking because the purpose for
        which her property was being taken was not for a public use

    b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** Was this a public use?

    c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** the taking did satisfy public use
        requirement; "use by the public" test did not apply; as long as
        there's some genuine

> public purpose a taking will satisfy the public use even if there's
> also private gain

d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** policy reasons and doctrinal reasons

    i.  Policy reasons

        1.  The "use by the public" test is difficult to administer

> ---how much public access is enough to satisfy the test? It is not
> clear how much access is enough, so it's not a reliable test

2.  The "use by the public" test is constrained and will limit what the
    public actually has access to

<!-- -->

ii. Doctrinal reasons

    1.  Previous cases have upheld the constitutionality of takings for
        a wide range of public purposes

        a.  *Hawaii* *Housing* *Authority* *v.* *Midkif*- eliminating
            social and economic evils of a land oligopoly was the public
            use in this case

        b.  *Berman* *v.* *Parker*-property would be taken and used for
            various purposes, one of which was to be resold to private
            parties for redevelopment that would include low-cost,
            affordable housing

    2.  This plan is entitled to deference

        a.  Low risk of capture by the developers

        b.  City carefully formulated the plan

<!-- -->

e.  **[Takeaway:]{.underline}** broad expansive understanding of public
    use, which means it doesn't provide much of a barrier to takings

### **Regulatory** **Takings**

I.  Conflicts arise when governments do something claiming they're
    acting under police power but affected citizens claim that the
    government should have been acting under its power of eminent
    domain; government is allowed to do the act either way, but if
    acting under:

    a.  POLICE POWER (merely addressing public nuisance)no compensation

    b.  EMINENT DOMAIN (take lot to turn into public
        garden)compensation

II. Doctrine that says that under some circumstances, a regulation may
    be burdensome in a way that would require the government to pay
    compensation to the burdened party if the government imposes that
    regulation on the party

    a.  Regulatory takings don't regulate anything

III. [Main question:]{.underline} When has a regulation gone too far so
     that the government must compensate the parties who have been
     adversely affected?

IV. Two ways courts can decide whether a government action counts as
    regulatory taking

    a.  Using categorical rulesper se takings

        i.  Actions that ALWAYS constitute takings

        ii. Two examples

            1.  Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.-a
                government action will be a taking if there is

                a.  Government authorization

                b.  Of something that is a permanent physical occupation

            2.  Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council-a gov.
                regulation is a taking if it eliminates ALL economically
                beneficial use of the land and if nuisance law would not
                have come to the same result

    b.  Using ad hoc rules-much more common

V.  **Pennsylvania** **Coal** **Co.** **v.** **Mahon** **(1922)**-first
    regulatory takings case

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** deal included provision that allowed
        coal company to mine out so much coal that the surface would
        collapse; after contract was signed, PA legislature passed the
        Kohler Act which prohibited mining that caused surface
        subsidence in land on which there was a residence

    b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** was this regulation a taking?

    c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** yes, this was a taking

    d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** ad hoc approach is appropriate;
        whether a regulation constitutes a taking is a "question of
        degree" and cannot be disposed of by general propositions

        i.  General Rule: while property may be regulated to a certain
            extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as
            a taking

        ii. What does "too far" mean?

        iii. Factors to consider:

             1.  How big was the diminution in value caused by the
                 regulation?

                 a.  Here, the regulation reduced to zero the value of
                     the coal pillars needed to keep the ground from
                     collapsing

                 b.  Alternative view (dissent)=should look at total
                     value of the mining rights that were involved in
                     the contract and see how much those have been
                     reduced; and here, they've been reduced by some but
                     not 100%

                 c.  If you take Holmes (majority) opinion, every
                     regulation that prohibits doing something arguably
                     might trip this condition

             2.  Is the mining that causes the subsidence a public
                 nuisance? Is that a regulation preventing harm to the
                 general public?

                 a.  If preventing harm to general public, then it is
                     regulable under the police power

                 b.  Here, this was not preventing harm to general
                     public; this regulation does not protect people
                     from harm because you could reach the same result
                     simply by requiring the mining company to provide
                     notice to owners of the surface that the ground
                     will collapse

                 c.  Dissent=this was an exercise of police power and
                     regulated an obnoxious use that could be considered
                     a public nuisance

             3.  Was there any average reciprocity of advantage?

                 a.  Does this regulation, in placing a burden on
                     plaintiff, also provide a benefit to plaintiff by
                     requiring everyone else to comply with it as well?
                     Is the benefit roughly equal to the burden?

                     i.  If so, then it doesn't look like a regulatory
                         taking

                     ii. If not, then it looks more like a taking

                 b.  Here, no average reciprocity of advantage, because
                     the burden of the regulation was placed on the
                     owners of the subsurface rights, but the benefit is
                     enjoyed by the owners of the surface rights

                     i.  Benefit is enjoyed entirely by people who own
                         property on surfaces and burden is worn
                         entirely by mining companies

                 c.  Dissent=agrees that there is no reciprocity of
                     advantage, but says it doesn't matter and that
                     reciprocity of advantage is relevant only when the
                     regulation seeks to provide a benefit to the public
                     rather than prevent a harm to the public

             4.  Does the regulation destroy existing property and
                 contract rights?

                 a.  Here, this regulation is destroying existing
                     property and contract rights, which makes it look
                     like a taking

                 b.  Dissent=this factor doesn't matter because the
                     government has to be able to police stuff

VI. **Penn** **Central** **Transportation** **Company** **v.** **City**
    **of** **New** **York** **(1978)**

    a.  **[Facts:]{.underline}** Penn Central wanted to build a tower on
        top of Grand Central Terminal; the NY Landmarks Preservation
        Commission rejected the plan to build the tower but provided
        compensation in the form of transferable development
        rights[^2^](#_heading=h.30j0zll); Grand Central was designated a
        landmark so the railroad got TDRs for the area above Grand
        Central because the Landmark Commission refused to approve the
        new additions; Grand Central then wanted money because they
        claimed it was a regulatory taking

    b.  **[Question:]{.underline}** is the landmark preservation law as
        applied to Grand Central a regulatory taking?

    c.  **[Holding:]{.underline}** Grand Central cannot get money as
        compensation; this was not a regulatory taking

    d.  **[Rationale:]{.underline}** the destruction of Penn Station led
        to the NY Landmark Preservation Law

        i.  Fact based, multi factor analysis

        ii. Different list of factors from Mahon

            1.  Look at diminution in value caused by regulation--- look
                at whole parcel (follows Brandeis dissent)

                a.  Here, the government's prohibition on Penn Central
                    building upwards was only a waiver of the right to
                    build up and Penn Central still had rights to the
                    rest of its property

            2.  Did the regulation interfere with distinct investment-
                backed expectations?

                a.  Here, no they did not

                    i.  Primary expectation was to use Grand Central as
                        a train terminal and Penn Central is still
                        allowed to do that

                b.  Regulation didn't interfere with Penn Central's
                    earning a reasonable rate of return because they got
                    the TDR

            3.  What was the character of the government action? Was
                there a physical invasion? Did the regulation merely
                adjust the benefits and burdens of economic life to
                promote the common good?

                a.  Here, this is more akin to a zoning regulation;
                    general regulation for the common good

    e.  **[Dissent:]{.underline}** we should use the Mahon factors, and
        if we do use those factors this is a regulatory taking

        i.  This was not abating a nuisance, not an exercise of police
            power

        ii. Government was not trying to prevent conduct dangerous to
            the safety, health, or welfare of others

        iii. Instead, this is just trying to provide an aesthetic
             benefit

> []{#_heading=h.30j0zll .anchor}2 TDR-things that are tradeable assets
> that reflect the difference between what zoning law would allow and

iv. This did not provide average reciprocity of advantage

v.  Eliminated an existing property right

vi. TDR was not fair market value compensation
