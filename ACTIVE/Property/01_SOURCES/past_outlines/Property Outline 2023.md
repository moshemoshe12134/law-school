# ACQUIRING PROPERTY

## FIRST POSSESSION

[]{#_Toc131516144 .anchor}**WILD ANIMALS:**

**Pierson v. Post, 3 Cai. R. 175 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1805)**

- **FACTS**: Post was hunting foxes on \"the beach\" 🡪 starts chasing
  after the fox 🡪 Pierson steps in and seizes the fox 🡪 Post sues
  Pierson 🡪 dispute over who owns the fox

- \"the beach\": [an unpossessed wasteland]{.underline}; [legally
  matters because]{.underline} had it been owned, then the ownership of
  the animal would have been settled by **rationale soli**

- **REASONING**: Foxes are wild by nature 🡪 people acquire property
  rights in them by occupancy (possession) only

- **[MAJORITY'S MOTIVATION]{.mark}: "certainty + "unequivocal"; clear
  allocation of property rights w/no disputes**

- **First possession** of animal occurs when:

  1.  **Manifests unequivocal intention of capturing the animal to
      individual's use,**

  2.  **Deprived the animal of his natural liberty**

  3.  **has brought the animal under his certain control**

- Hunters: (1) mortally wounded the animal; (2) didn\'t abandon pursuit

- Trappers: (1) deprived of natural liberty; (2) rendered escape
  impossible

- **Analysis**: Pierson was the one who injured the fox and \"deprived
  him of his natural liberty\" 🡪 must have **MORTALLY wounded** the fox

- **[DISSENT]{.mark}: Probable Capture Rule: (1)** pursuer is **within
  reach** OR **reasonable prospect of taking; and (2) shows intention**
  to convert animal to their own use

  - Reasoning: **[incentives for efficient activity/fox
    hunting]{.underline}**

  - **Recommend institutional competence: tribunal of sportsmen**

  - P**roblems: less certain, uses "reasonable" estimation**

**Ghen v. Rich (D. Mass. 1881): custom dictates first possession rule**

- **FACTS**: Ellis found the whale and didn\'t notify the company 🡪 sold
  it to Rich 🡪 Ghen sued Rich; Ghen claims that he took the proper steps
  in accordance with custom to secure the whale 🡪 Pierson reasoning

- **REASONING:**

- **Technical context of first possession is important + influences
  outcome after applying the legal rule**

- HERE, the court cites **REASONABLE LOCAL CUSTOM:** **Possession goes
  to whoever mortally wounds the whale**

- **FOLLOWING CUSTOM IS APPROPRIATE WHERE:**

  - \(1\) **Custom necessarily limited in application**, affecting only
    a few people 🡪 stakes low

  - \(2\) **Long acquiescence to this rule** 🡪 people may come to expect
    that this is how things are meant to be + rule has worked well

  <!-- -->

  - \(3\) Following custom is **necessary to incentivize industry to
    continue**

  <!-- -->

  - \(4\) Custom **seems fair** 🡪 finder\'s fee

**Problems with Custom:**

- Problematic if a parochial group develops a custom that is beneficial
  for themselves but not for those excluded from that group; may not be
  socially optimal

- May be difficult for outsiders to know what the custom is

  - Generally done 🡪 then anyone in the industry would be conscious of
    it

  - Highly localized 🡪 more alienating to outsiders

## TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS

- **Tragedy of the Commons**: too many people, scarce resources 🡪
  overutilization

  - can\'t save up for the future + no incentive to invest

- Solutions:

  - 1\) [**Centralized system approach**:]{.underline} Leviathan \[state
    authority to control some power - generally the state-endorsed power
    to use violence\]; **Problems**: Inherently coercive + Central
    planners may lack important information/subject to error

  - 2\) **[Privatization]{.underline}**: every person has exclusive
    rights to specific portion of the land 🡪incentivizes efficiency bc
    every owner \"internalizes the benefits of their labor and suffers
    the costs of their own decisions\"; **Problems**: need borders and
    surveillance to enforce privatization 🡪 expensive, new risk factor:
    not all land is not created equal 🡪 risk mitigation factors 🡪 more
    institutional costs

  - 3\) **[Institutional solutions]{.underline}**: standard
    justification for \"property\" is that it solves TOC

- **[Anti-commons]{.underline}**: Arises when too many people own a
  segment of the commons; ownership rights that are too broadly
  dispersed 🡪 costly to get everyone to agree about what to do with the
  resource 🡪 underutilization

- **[Semi-commons]{.underline}**: when a resource is subject to private
  exclusion right in some uses but open for other uses (ex. Fair Use for
  Copyright)

## WATER RIGHTS

- **[Diffuse water]{.underline}**: pest to be eradicated; water flowing
  everywhere 🡪 Every landowner has a right to use self-help to expel
  diffuse water from their property, **even if that means pushing the
  water onto someone else's property**

  - Note this right is reciprocal - the "someone else" will have every
    right to push the water back onto your property!

  - Some jurisdictions have a requirement that the steps taken to expel
    the water be **reasonable** (i.e. "reasonable requirement")

- **[Defined channel]{.underline}**: valuable resources

- Riparian rights: pertain to properties adjacent to a waterway that (a)
  governs the use of surface water and (b) gives all owners of land
  contiguous to streams, lakes, and ponds equal rights to the water,
  whether the right is exercised or not. Runs w/the land + can't be
  severed.

**1) Egalitarian Natural flow**: Rejected in US; [as a prop owner near a
natural water source, **can remove water [to the extent that you
preserve the natural water flow to the people downstream of you/do not
disrupt natural flow]{.underline}**]{.mark}

- **Disadvantages**: Implicit idea that everyone is entitled an equal
  amount, everyone gets the same so long as they don't disrupt the
  natural flow

- Can prevent beneficial use of water

  - If even a small amount removed impacts natural flow, could wind up
    w/ most water unused

- Can present **holdout problem**

  - You can use amount that does disturb natural flow if you get
    permission from riparian owners downstream

    - But when you get to last riparian owner, they will likely hold out
      for \$\$\$\$

- Does not apply in the US bc US legal system generally favors
  **productive property use**

- Rejected in ***Evans v. Merriweather***

**2) Riparian Owner Reasonable use 🡪 East Coast:** [each riparian owner
has a right to use the water, but the use must be **reasonable, and the
use must not more injurious than is necessary to accomplish the
reasonable use**]{.mark}

- taken in ***Evans v. Merriweather***

- **Reasonable use**: socially valuable 🡪 natural use \> artificial use;
  DEP ON CONTEXT

  - **[Artificial use]{.underline}**: for commercial use, \$\$, comfort

  - **[Natural use]{.underline}**: essential (hydration/household) 🡪
    depends on environment

- **[Advantages]{.underline}**: Allows for more productive use, and
  specifically reasonable use

- **[Disadvantages]{.underline}**: need criterion for determining what
  is reasonable

- Evans v. Merriweather privileges natural uses over artificial uses
  (modern language: essential vs. non-essential uses)

> *If both riparian owners have artificial uses, both can use it, but
> neither has a priority*

**3) First Appropriation 🡪 Dry, Western States[: First appropriator of
water in a stream for a beneficial purpose has a right to that amount to
the extent of the amount of appropriation necessary for that purpose
]{.mark}**

- ***Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Company***

- Same set of facts as ***Evans v. Merriweather*** but outcome is
  different

  - Coffin, downstream from LHD, breaches LHD's land to get water when
    water levels drop

  - LHD sues Coffin

  - **Holding:** First appropriation approach is the law in CO, not the
    reasonable use, riparian rule on the East Coast due to the **dry,
    arid environment of CO**

    - **First appropriator of water from defined body of water for a
      [beneficial purpose]{.underline}** **has a prior right to the
      extent of the first appropriation**

      - #1 First Appropriator

      - #2 Beneficial Purpose

        - Diverting water to dry place for agriculture = beneficial

      - #3 Your rights are to the extent of the first appropriation /
        what you were first using for a beneficial purpose

        - If you want to use more later, even for beneficial use, you
          cannot use more than you first appropriated if there is a
          downstream user

 

**Evans v. Merriweather (1842)**

- [**RULE**: each riparian owner has a right to use the water, but the
  use must be **(1) reasonable**, and **(2) the use must not injure any
  other riparian owner more than is necessary to accomplish the
  reasonable use**]{.mark}

- A person **may use all of the water for natural use**, but for
  **artificial use**, he must **leave enough water** for downstream
  users

  - Artificial use

  - Water for irrigation = essential for living in arid countries,
    artificial in wet

  - [When there are disputes btw artificial wants, then neither have an
    exclusive right]{.underline} 🡪 need to send it to a jury to
    determine reasonability

- **REASONING**: mere prior use of running water, w/o consent, confer no
  exclusive rights

- Court doesn\'t sent it to a jury 🡪 Evans's dam was illegal, so
  Merriweather wins

**Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Company**

- **FACTS**: Same facts as Evans but diff outcome \[WESTERN STATE\];
  Coffin, downstream from LHD, breaches LHD's land to get water when
  water levels drops 🡪LHD sues Coffin

<!-- -->

- **[RULE: In dry, arid environment, whoever puts the water to
  productive use gets the *superior* right by priority of appropriation
  and allowed to use as much as he wants even though it leaves no water
  for down streamers.]{.mark}**

- **REASONING**: Right to use water has existed from the time of
  Colorado\'s development

- P can divert water b/c dry climate in CO allows diversion of water for
  agricultural purpose if use is beneficial; concern about reliance on
  the established rule

- **1. First Appropriator**

- **2. "Beneficial" use** (x individual's amusement)

- **3. Rights are as large as the extent is**: if you want to use extra
  water and no one else is using the water yet, you can take it. But, if
  there was a second user before you wanted to take the extra water, you
  cannot.

**4) Fourth Way of Water Right Allocation:**

- Correlate property rights of water to some other justly allocated
  property rights

- Based on idea that just allocation is one that bears an appropriate
  relation to some other resource rights that has been justly allocated

- Shows up in the context of **accession**

  - i.e. if you own a tree, you own the fruits it bears

## AD COELUM

- General Idea: if you own the surface of the land, then you own up to
  the core and above the surface up to infinity

**SUBSURFACE**:

**Edwards v. Sims, 232 Ky. 791 (1929):** ad coelum / use of subterranean
land of which you do not have surface rights to requires you to **share
profits** with surface right owner

- **FACTS**: Court applied ad coelum doctrine + said that cave creator
  had to share his profits w/ neighbor who owned some property above the
  mine

- **MAJORITY**: cites ad coelum doctrine as it applies to mines; **the
  owner of realty, unless there has been a division of the estate, is
  entitled to the free and unfettered control of his own land above,
  upon, and beneath the surface** 🡪 no real policy issues

- **DISSENT'S ALTERNATIVE RULE:** Focuses on the policy issues (favors
  active, creative owners; easily administrable) + rejects ad coelum; Ad
  coelum/possession rule should be that owners of land own everything
  above and under the surface **to the extent that owner can:**

  - **(1) subject the land to his dominion/control AND**

  - **(2) use it to his profit/benefit**

- Thus, the cave should belong absolutely to him who owns the entrance,
  and this ownership extends to wherever is connected and explored after
  the entrance

- P did not have access to the entrance of cave from their own property,
  D had the access to the cave on his property; D did not dig the cave
  out, make it tourist attraction, didn't do any of the work

- Implies active users should be rewarded

- P couldn't have exercised control over the space below, had no way of
  doing so

- What D owed was something "indefinable... it was a vision translated
  to reality"

- **Nemo Dat:** You can't sell what you ain't got!

[]{#_Toc131516148 .anchor}**[Sequential Possession]{.underline}**

- Concerns multiple persons serially claiming property on some theory
  other than purchase or gift from the prior owner

- Not the first possessor - at best, you\'re the second possessor

**Armory v. Delamirie, 1 Strange 505 (1722): finder has rights against
all the world except the true owner;** finder does not become the new
owner, as his rights are subordinate to the true owner (TO) + he has
duties to the TO (\"bailee\" to TO)

- **FACTS**: Armory (P) found a jewel while sweeping a chimney 🡪 P took
  the jewel to Delamirie (D) for appraisal 🡪 D's apprentice appropriated
  the jewel through deceit and refused to return it to P 🡪 P sued for
  return of the jewel or for its value

- **REASONING:**

- Court holds that although Armory does not have absolute ownership, he
  has property rights good against everyone except for the true owner

- DAMAGES: Ct doesn\'t have access to the jewel, can\'t figure out what
  the value is 🡪 follows the information forcing rule : tells jury that
  unless D shows that the jewel is not of the finest quality, the jury
  should place the maximum possible value on the jewel

- Info forcing used when there is informational asymmetry

- Imposed REBUTTABLE, DEFAULT PRESUMPTION 🡪 strong incentive to bring
  forward info/the jewel

**In all the below finder cases, the EARLIEST POSSESSOR wins:**

**Clark v. Maloney (1840):** first finder has superior title to the
second finder

- **FACTS:** Thomas Clark (P) found 10 pine logs 🡪 P tied logs to mouth
  of the creek 🡪 Maloneys (Ds) took possession of the logs, claiming to
  have found them floating up the creek 🡪 P sued D for trover to recover
  the value of the logs.

- **RULE**: possession gives prima facie title, because it can be
  rebutted by evidence of a better title, where the first finder has
  superior title to the second finder

- Said that original loss of logs does not change TO's absolute rights,
  so loss by first finder does not divest him of his special rights  

**Anderson v. Gouldberg, 53 N.W. 636 (1892): [possession through
conversion is good against all the world except against one with better
title]{.mark}**

- Anderson (P) harvested logs without permission from a third party 🡪
  Gouldberg (D) appropriated the timber from the P's mill claiming that
  he had harvested it 🡪 P filed claim for return of possession or the
  value of the timber

- TC instructed TJ that P's title to the timber would be subordinate
  only to the title of the bona fide owner even if he harvested the
  timber illegally

- **RULE:** possession is good against all the world except if someone
  has better title; one retains that special possessory right even if
  they converted that good/item

- **REASONING: Court applied Armory**

- Give it to the first converter

- Seek to avoid disputes 🡪 create rule that says first possessor is
  entitled to it

- Losing property doesn\'t reduce one\'s rights

- **[Policy Reason]{.underline}**: discourage seizing property from
  someone who has converted it

<!-- -->

- **Jus terri defense:** Attempting to claim possessory rights based on
  legal title in 3^rd^ party

  - A sues B seeking to recover a bike. A presents evidence C is TO → A
    has failed to show that A has a possessory interest in the bike over
    B

- **Nemo dat quod non habet**

  - No one gives what he does not have

  - You can only give what you have

  - If A shared ownership of parcel w/ C, and A sells their share to B

    - C winds up sharing ownership w/ C

- **Prior in time, prior in right**

  - If A sells parcel to B and A "sells" parcel again to C

    - B gets to keep parcel + C gets nothing

    - B bought the parcel first, B was prior in time, prior in right,
      because, nemo dat

## Adverse Possession

- Adverse possessor's (AP) right is even good against the original
  owner, despite the wrongdoing.

  - **When an owner sits on her original right to exclude, the statute
    of limitation for challenging the original unlawful entry expire**s,
    **the AP becomes the new owner and can exercise the right to exclude
    against all world and the original owner**.

- **Policy:** [(1)]{.mark} The AP has come to realize that he has this
  land; [(2)]{.mark} Favoring active users over people who are sleeping
  on their rights, b/c AP doesn't happen when the true owner (TO) is
  around. TO does not actually use the property but monitor the property
  to keep out trespassers; [(3)]{.mark} Decreases the transaction cost
  of determining title

- [ELEMENTS:]{.underline}

- **(1) actual possession**

- **(2) exclusive**

- **(3) open, notorious, and visible;**

- **(4) continuous and interrupted**

- **(5) adverse (hostile) under claim of right or color of title**

- **(6) for the statutorily required time**

> **Scott v. Anderson-Tully Co.: [illustrated (1) actual, (2) excl, (3)
> open + notorious]{.mark}**

- **FACTS:** AP painted fence, cut timber, issued hunting license for
  underdeveloped land

<!-- -->

- **REASONING:** In assessing whether AP had possession of the title,
  the court added a 7th requirement: **must be peaceful**

**[(1) ACTUAL POSSESSION]{.underline}**: Possessory acts vary
w/character of land, have to use it as a landowner would

- Telling everyone that you own a land; physically occupying a part of
  the land 🡪 not enough actual possession

- May only possess the section of land on [which you are conducting
  activities allocating AP;]{.underline} recreational activities$\neq$AP

**[(2) EXCLUSIVE]{.underline}**: can't share (esp. w/TO)

- **(1) show intention to possess land to the exclusion of everyone
  else's** claims to the land, and

- **(2) conduct must give unequivocal indication** that you are
  exercising dominion as the sole owner

- **inviting** **others** to use the property does not negate ownership

**[(3) OPEN AND NOTORIOUS:]{.underline}** Possession is **open and
notorious** when it is the kind of use the usual owner would make for
the land. The adverse possessor's occupation must be **sufficiently
apparent to put true owner on actual or constructive notice** that
trespass is occurring.

- i.e. issuing license to hunt, (a month-long) harvesting woods,
  developing the land

**[(4) CONTINUOUS/UNINTERRUPTED]{.underline}**

- Continual: repeatedly

- Continuous: without interruption

**Howard v. Kunto (1970): [CONTINUOUS possession]{.mark}** [may be
calculated including possession by immediate predecessors of adverse
possessor, where successive occupants are in "privity"]{.mark}; **summer
occupancy also still = continuous**

- **FACTS**: In 1932, McCall had a house with a record title that
  erroneously described his tract to be the 50-foot tract immediately to
  the W of his; erroneous deed passed several times over the years,
  including to Miller. Miller built a dock on the misdeeded property. 🡪
  In 1959, Miller conveyed the erroneous deed to Kunto (D), who took
  possession of the mis-described plot of land. 🡪 In 1960, Howard (P)
  ordered a survey of the area and discovered that he and several of his
  neighbors were occupying plots of land that were not the plots
  described in their respective deeds: P actually owned record title to
  the land occupied by Moyer, and Moyer owned record title to land
  occupied by D. 🡪 P and Moyer conveyed their record deeds to each
  other, which resulted in P holding record title to the land occupied
  by D 🡪 P then brought suit to quiet title on the land occupied by D

- TC held that D, having occupied the property for less than a year, had
  not satisfied the requirements for AP, and thus the land belonged
  to P. 🡪 D appealed

- **RULE**: CONTINUANCY dep on **(1) ordinary use by owners of like
  property of a like nature** (dep on nature of the property); and **(2)
  APs are allowed to tack immediate predecessors** to see if it adds up
  to the stat req.

- **HOLDING**: Continuity satisfied 🡪 court held in favor of Kuntos

- **REASONING**: Case ended up hinging on **continuity**; issue: stat
  req is 10 yrs

- Ds have only been on the property for 1 yr + dwelling was used only as
  a summer home - not year round 🡪 not continuous ?

- Court said that summer occupancy constituted ordinary use by owners of
  like property of a like nature; i.e. cont. using it the way that ppl
  ordinarily use this type of property

  - Note impt of the nature of the prop in det how it applies to this
    case

- Court further says that APs are allowed to tack immediate predecessors
  to see if it adds up to the statutory requirement

  - Court notes that trad there had been a **[privity]{.underline}**
    requirement 🡪 some sort of legally relevant, reasonable connection
    sufficient to raise that claim above that of an ordinary trespasser
    🡪 trad typical that it would be satisfied by the deed

  - In this case, if we look at the law fxnlly, we consider WHY there is
    a privity requirement 🡪 fxns to diff squatters from APs

    - Reason why we have privity req traditionally was to differentiate
      squatters from adverse possessors

- Continuity satisfied 🡪 court held in favor of Kuntos

**[(5) ADVERSE (HOSTILE) under a claim of right/color of
title]{.underline}**

- **Adverse**: must be hostile in that the **AP had no permission** 🡪
  not hostile w/permission

- **Claim of right**: all other elements + possessor acted in ***good
  faith*** or ***bad faith*** or irrelevant + any stipulation

  - **(1) Good faith:** AP subjectively (but mistakenly) believes he is
    legally entitled to possession of the property; note **NY/majority**
    req reasonable basis (See **Carpenter)**

  - **(2) "Maine Rule" = Bad faith 🡪 no one uses this anymore**

  - **(3) \*\*Connecticut Rule:** AP's subjective state of mind is
    irrelevant + all that matters is lack of permission from TO to use
    the property

- **\"color of title\":** "You have a ***deed*** and ***think that the
  property is yours***." + defect on the deed.

  - In minority of JX, NO COT 🡪 NO AP

  - In JX that don\'t req COT 🡪 COT gives an advantage (i.e. shorter
    SOL)

  - NY Real Property Act §512: if it is done with a deed, AP of partly
    improved territory will extend to the remainder of the unimproved
    territory

  - Some JX, including NY (pg172): if you possessed some property under
    COT

    - Ex) 50-acre parcel + someone occupies 2-acre (put up fence around,
      etc). The actual requirement under color of title = you only
      possessed to 2-acre. But, in some jurisdiction, your actual
      occupying of the 2acre may put the original owner on constructive
      notice toward the 2-acre.

    - Court says - look at the practice around/the custom in the
      neighborhood to determine what \"improving\" means

  - See **Scott v. Anderson-Tully**: court req COT

    - Acts sufficient for improved land \"vary w/ characteristics of the
      land\"

**Carpenter v. Ruperto:** [court says AP acting in bad faith cannot
claim AP, policy concern that awarding bad faith conduct encourages such
conduct]{.mark}; note that knowledge of defect in title ALONE is
insufficient to find bad faith, must have knowledge of lack of title +
knowledge of no basis for claiming property interest

- **FACTS**: Carpenter's (P) property was situated next to an empty lot
  🡪 P knew that the land belonged to another, but she cleared it out of
  concern that the lot would attract rodents 🡪 Over the years, P
  developed the lot 🡪 In 1978, a group of investors purchased the
  adjacent lot (Ruperto) (Ds). 🡪 D attempted to settle any dispute
  regarding use of the land 🡪 negotiation failed 🡪 P brought an action
  to quiet Ruperto's title on the lot through AP 🡪 TC det that P did not
  obtain the adjacent lot through adverse possession under a claim of
  right, as Ms. Carpenter did not use good faith in using the adjacent
  lot because she knew its title belonged to someone else.

- Ms. Carpenter appealed and petitioned for certiorari to the Supreme
  Court of Iowa.

- [**RULE**: **Good faith is an essential component of claim of right
  for AP. However, knowledge of a defect in title is not alone
  sufficient to preclude proof of good faith.**]{.mark}

- Knowledge of lack of title + knowledge of no basis for claiming an
  interest in the property à good faith claim of right cannot be
  established

<!-- -->

- **REASONING**: No confusion or mistake in this case; P knew someone
  else had title + she had no interest in it or claim to it

**[(6) FOR THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED TIME]{.underline}**

- At least 5 years, 5-21 years

- **Tacking Rule** in meeting the time period required for AP,
  successive owners of a property may add their occupancy times together
  to collectively claim AP is allowed ***[if the successive occupants
  are in privity]{.underline}*** (***[deed]{.underline}*** transferring
  ownership to successive occupants or **reasonable connection enough**
  to raise their claim of rights above the wrongdoer)

- **Additional Time Approach:** the statutory clock may be longer b/c of
  **disability**

  - Even though the statute says 10 years, **the clock stops if the
    owner had disability at the time AP entered.**

  - Ex) When AP enters, TO is insane 🡪 25 years pass than TO regains his
    sanity. TO has 10 years to bring an action to regain possession

- **Disabilities** such as age, insane, legally incompetent, in prison
  at the time the AP entered

  - Disability arising ***later*** do not affect the running of the
    statute and disabilities in the same or successive owners cannot be
    tacked.

    - Ex) If the AP begins + enters into coma, not relevant.

  - Tolling approach: Minor at the time of AP's entrance onto the
    property but TO went to jail

**#7** Some jurisdictions also require possession to be **peaceful** -
*Scott v. Anderson-Tully*

- Peaceful in *Scott* bc no one complained about the "property line"
  Anderson-Tully drew and no one interfered with their use

**[[Permission from the true owner defeats AP!]{.underline}]{.mark}**

- It makes the possession non-adverse

**ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF ADVERSE POSSESSION**

- **Based on the reliance interests of the AP whose interests build up
  over time and taking the property actually harms society**

- **1) Endowment effect 🡪 controversial theory**

  - Ex: New coffee mug and ask someone how much they would pay for it,
    say \$5. Less than \$5 would be a bargain, more than \$5 not
    interested. People in the room with the mugs will pay more because
    they've been handed it, than the people who do not have the mug in
    their hand and whether they are buying or selling. Is that rational?
    Professor says no.

- **2) Loss aversion (related to risk aversion, but not the same) 🡪**
  risk aversion is people disliking variation; human beings care more
  about losses than they do about gains; theory that says that we want
  to protect people from losing things

- **3) "Property as Personality" 🡪** property is essential for
  development of your personality, requires making plans for the future;
  if you have no stability in the things that you own then you cannot
  reasonable make plans, essentially items that cannot be replaced by
  the same item of monetary value (ex: wedding ring) / "expugnable
  property" 🡪 property you don't care about (ex: dollar bill)

- **4) Utilitarian theory 🡪 allows us to decrease the transaction costs
  to determine who owns what when we allow adverse possession**

## Ownership of Body Parts

- Universal consensus: Persons should not be regarded as objects or
  commodities to be exchanged by other persons

- Controversy is also growing about whether ***unique forms of human
  expression***, such as the creations of artists or objects that are of
  special importance to particular cultural groups, should be subject to
  treatment as property

**Moore v. Regents of UC (1990):** patient does not have property rights
to body parts, once they have left the body, to uphold conversion claim

- **FACTS:** Moore (P) lived in Seattle, had leukemia à treated by
  doctor at UCLA à removed spleen + D had not disclosed that Moore\'s
  spleen had certain unusual characteristics that would make D's
  research easier 🡪 created a new cell line based on those cells and got
  a patent and received the patent on behalf of UCLA and the scientist
  w/future proceeds estimated to the amount of \$3 billion per year 🡪 P
  sued for conversion of property w/o consent

- TC held action invalid bc Moore had no property right in his spleen
  cells after removal

- Moore sued Goldie, other scientists, and UCLA

- **HOLDING**: Majority affirmed dismissal of the conversion claim,
  holding that the spleen is not Moore\'s property

- **MAJORITY'S REASONING:**

- **[(1) Ct says that existing law of property doesn't give Moore a prop
  right to the spleen]{.underline}**

- [to establish conversion, a plaintiff must establish an actual
  interference with her ownership or right of possession]{.mark}.

- **[(2) Normatively, ct says law shouldn't grant Moore a property right
  to the spleen]{.underline}**

- **1.** Balancing **policy** reasons: patients\' autonomies v.
  researchers needs for research

- **2.** want to avoid disincentives to valuable research (i.e.
  uncertainty about title 🡪 high transaction costs, reliable
  indemnification problems, etc.)

- **3.** **Institutional competence**: Just as in *Ghen* + dissent in
  *Pierson*, defer to those familiar w/ the custom → court shouldn't
  decide complex policy matters, legislature should

- **DISSENT BY J. MOSK:** mere fact that there are restrictions on
  utilization of biomedical waste does not indicate that it is not
  property 🡪 he did have ownership rights to the spleen, but property
  rights may come with restrictions

**BIOPIRACY**

- indigenous peoples should receive a share of revenues from drugs that
  are made:

  - either from plants found only on their lands or

  - that are based on folk knowledge by their communities

- Challenge is in figuring out the amount of compensation - how do you
  apportion the value of various inputs

- REMEDIES: May be that there is no objective amount

# RIGHT TO EXCLUDE

## Trespass to Land

- Common law: absolute right to exclude others from land

- Restatement Tort §158: Liability for Intentional Intrusion on the Land

  - One is subject to liability to another for trespass, **irrespective
    of whether he thereby causes harm** to any legally protected
    interest of the other, if he **[intentionally]{.underline}**:
    (**[only intent to enter]{.underline}** onto the land matters)

    - \(a\) enters land in the possession of the other, or causes a
      thing or a third person to do so, or

    - \(b\) remains on the land, or

    - \(c\) fails to remove from the land a thing which he is under a
      duty to remove.

- Policy reason for prohibiting trespass: protect a landowner's right to
  exclusive possession + maximize efficient use of the land

**Jacques v. Steenberg Homes: [DEFINITION OF TRESPASS;]{.mark} property
owners have an unmitigated right to exclude 🡪**property owner can
recover \$1 in nominal + \$100K in punitive damages for intentional
trespass, **[even absent any harm]{.underline}**

- **FACTS:** Steenberg Homes (D) had a mobile home to deliver + easiest
  route was across Jacques' (Ps) land 🡪 P protested but D plowed path
  through field via that path and delivered the home 🡪 P sued D for
  intentional trespass 🡪 D conceded intentional trespass but argued that
  punitives cannot be awarded without compensatory damages

- TC jury awarded \$1 nominal damages and \$100k in punitives 🡪 circuit
  court set aside punitives 🡪 court of appeals affirmed, stating that it
  was bound by precedent establishing that award of nominal damages will
  not sustain a punitive damage award

- Steenberg Homes conceded the trespass but contested the punitives
  because there were only nominal compensatories

- [**RULE**: Landowner can recover nominal and punitive damage b/c right
  to exclude others from one's own property is one of the most essential
  property rights.]{.mark}

- **REASONING**:

- NOMINAL DAMAGE: actual harm in intentional trespass +

- PUNITIVE DAMAGES: Court says that the real harm was the **loss of the
  right to exclude**

  - purpose is deterrence!

- Two competing considerations:

  - Incentives for socially efficient behavior vs what\'s right morally,
    ethically

  - self-help - may worry that if the law doesn\'t step in, then the
    parties in Jacque v. Steenberg Homes may take matters into their own
    \[armed\] hands

**[Hinman v. Pac. Air Transp.]{.underline}, 300 U.S. 654, 57 S. Ct. 431,
81 L. Ed. 865 (1937): [[AIR/SEA ARE NOT TRESPASS]{.underline} EXCEPT IN
SO FAR AS ONE MAY [ACTUALLY USE]{.underline} IT]{.mark}**

- **FACTS**: Airplanes operated by Δ regularly flew at altitudes of less
  than 100 feet over Π's land. Π requested that Δ stop these flights,
  but Δ disregarded the requests. Π then sued, arguing that the ad
  coelum rule gave him the right to prevent aircraft from flying above
  his land and that such flights were trespasses.

- **REASONING**:

- Court declines to recognize ad coelum as law

  - Landowner owns the airspace that they **actually use**

  - [Ad coelum really means you have **the right to exclude to the
    extent that you actually use the property** - **right to use space
    above your property w/o interference**]{.mark}

  - "You can't own infinity" → notion of ownership is abstract
    conception

    - Similar to dissent in *Edwards* cave case → ownership of cave
      below your property that you can't even access is abstract,
      doesn't work

- Air + sea incapable of private ownership except to the extent they can
  actually be used

  - **Trespass** = person flying above either

    - Injures land below, OR

    - [Actually interferes with owners beneficial use of the
      land]{.mark}

      - *i.e. , even if you DON'T use the air space above your land (and
        thus you don't have a right to the space), if someone else is
        doing something in the air space that disturbs your beneficial
        use of the surface land, then you can bring a trespass claim
        against them*

- Court enjoys Hinman to take spite fence down + but says injunction
  could be limited if he had "good faith" building project

## Continual/Repeated Trespasses

**Baker v. Howard County Hunt:** P can recover equitable relief as a
remedy for tort of repeated trespass

 

- **FACTS**: D's dogs continually trespassed on P's property to hunt 🡪
  D's dogs killed P's chickens, P shot some of D's dogs

- **Holding**: P can get injunction ordering D to stop trespassing bc
  equitable relief is available as a remedy

- **MAJORITY'S REASONING:**

<!-- -->

- [Owners of realty had unquestionable right to enjoy it in peace and
  quiet without molestation or hindrance so long as their use did not
  harm others]{.mark}

**Requirements for equitable relief:**

[1) P does not have any adequate remedy at law]{.underline}

Injury is "tangible + incapable of measurement"

[2) P has to come to court w/ clean hands]{.underline}

Shooting the dogs wasn't so horrible

- [3) There is a balance between hardships of P + D]{.underline}
  *typically this is another traditional requirement, was used in Golden
  Press but not in Baker*

  - Considers hardship of D if injunction is issued balanced against
    hardship of P if injunction is not issued

  - If balance is too askew, court may still decline to issue an
    injunction, even if other 2 elements are met

  - If good faith encroachment, court is more likely to deny injunction

  - If bad faith encroachment, court is more likely to grant injunction
    **regardless of imbalance hardship to D**

- 

## Continuous Trespasses

**Encroachment**: Permanent or continuing trespass caused by the
construction of a building or other improvement that *partially* extends
onto another's land.

**Pile v. Pedrick, 31 A. 646 (1895): [ABSOLUTIST/[TRADITIONAL
APPROACH]{.underline}: injunctive relief awarded for continuous, good
faith trespasses]{.mark}**

- **FACTS:** parties owned adjoining properties + Ds had erected a large
  factory and used a portion of the P's ground for their party wall 🡪 D
  were building an additional story to their factory and had inserted
  some windows and were about to insert others 🡪 Ps filed bill prayed
  for order on Ds to remove windows + an injunction as to further
  construction

- Ds alleged that the wall erected was entirely upon their own ground,
  inasmuch as they were given to know 🡪 had premises surveyed by
  competent surveyors and knowing they would want to put windows in
  their wall they employed competent builders and architects and
  instructed them to build the premises wholly on Ds' land

- P found that brick wall (18") clear of the property line + stands its
  entire length on Ds' land

- However, foundation wall encroached on the Ps property \~ 1.5"--
  1.675"

- Pile sought an injunction that would require Pedrick to dig out the
  foundation from Pedrick\'s side \--\> would require knocking down the
  factory wall \--\> far more expensive than just slicing off the
  portion that infringed on Pile\'s territory 🡪 granted by TC

- **[RULE: A landowner may obtain an injunction to remove a portion of a
  neighbor's encroaching building, regardless of whether the
  encroachment is minor or unintentional.]{.mark}**

- **REASONING:**

- Court said that there are two approaches:

  - Treat incursion as a permanent trespass 🡪 award one-time, permanent
    damages

  - Get an injunction 🡪 would req D to remove portion that crossed the
    property line

<!-- -->

- Here, even though D did not intentionally trespass, and the mistake
  was made by the surveyor, this is still encroachment.

- A landowner can **obtain an *[injunction]{.underline}* to remove**,
  not \$\$ for *[permanent damage]{.underline}*.

- [Policy]{.underline}*:* As a matter of law and for the sake of public
  policy, **[no individual may occupy land that he or she does not
  own.]{.underline}**

**Golden Press, Inc. v. Rylands: [[MODERN VIEW:]{.underline} [MONEY
DAMAGES AT MARKET PRICE]{.underline}, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF DENIED FOR GOOD
FAITH CONTINUOUS TRESPASS]{.mark}**

- **FACTS:** Ps (Rylands and Reid) and Ds (Golden Press) had adjoining
  property 🡪 D constructed building on its property, which P claimed had
  foundation and footings that extended from 2 to 3.5" upon Ps land 🡪 Ps
  prayed for injunction req that D remove all footings and foundations
  upon their property

- Jury returned a verdict in favor of the D in terms of damages

- Court found encroachment as alleged and granted mandatory injunction
  req that Ds projecting footings be removed from Ps property

- **MAJORITY'S REASONING:**

- Sometimes, a slight/harmless encroachment is allowed.

  - [Injunction may be denied **when the encroachment is** ]{.mark}

    - [(1) ***[unintentional]{.underline}* and
      *[slight]{.underline}***,]{.mark}

    - [(**[2) does not negatively impact P's use
      and]{.underline}**]{.mark}

    - [***[(3) his damage small and fairly compensable]{.underline}***,
      while]{.mark}

    - [***[(4)]{.underline}* the cost of removal** is so great as to
      cause grave hardship/make the removal **unconscionable**.]{.mark}

  - To allow injunction \> \$\$\$, ask "**was the encroachment in good
    faith(unintentional**)?"

    - Balancing of hardship = disproportionate?

      - Here, expense of removal is too severe and unconscionable.

    - No legal remedy is available

  - Court likely to **deny injunctive relief when encroachment is
    unintentional**

  - Court likely to **award injunctive relief when encroachment is
    intentional / in bad faith**

    - [Regardless of expense of removal]{.mark}

  - Reasoning → D would have unequal bargaining power for negotiations
    after case is settled, not fair that P who has injunction has so
    much leverage over D

  - **[Shifts from *Pile* to considering if encroachment was bad/good
    faith, and having that influence if willing to grant
    injuction]{.underline}**

## Theory: Ex Ante vs. Ex Post

- **Ex ante:**

  - **Pile v. Pedrick**: injunction gives strong incentives to builders
    to make sure that they are building on the right side of the
    property line; precautions can be expensive

- **Ex post:**

  - Enormous expense falling on the defendant for trivial encroachments

  - Courts naturally gravitates towards ex post analysis 🡪 discourages
    litigation **[after the conflict arises]{.underline}** 🡪 may be that
    one that has bad consequences from the ex ante perspective

    - **Golden Press** - money damages so small that it's not worth
      suing

## Mistaken Improvers

- Accidental, continuous trespass that makes the victim\'s property more
  valuable

- Traditional rule: **[if a builder puts a building on someone else\'s
  land without their permission, then the building becomes a fixture and
  therefore belongs to the landowner]{.mark}**

  - **FIXTURE**: something that used to be a channel for a movable
    property but now has become annexed to the land (i.e. chandelier)

  - Goal to incentivize people to be more cautious about building on the
    correct property

- JX differ in how they treat these situations

  - Some allow landowners to get an injunction to demolish the
    property/retain it as a fixture (seems unfair ex post) 🡪 seems
    socially inefficient

  - Some JX have an exception if the improver built in **good faith,
    mistaken belief** that he/she owned the land 🡪 have equitable
    remedies

    - \(1\) Transportable 🡪 builder can move it away

    - \(2\) Not transportable 🡪 builder can sell the building to
      landowner at MP

    - \(3\) If the landowner can\'t purchase the property, then the
      builder is ordered to purchase the land containing the building

      - In option 3: court auctions both land + structure to a 3P 🡪
        divides proceeds btw landowner + builder

    - BUT **[NEVER]{.underline}** go onto another's land w/o permission
      and demolish the building

      - bad faith and maliciousness (any removal is malicious)

- Intention of such an unwieldy solution is to impose responsibilities
  on both the builder and the landowner (officious intermeddlers)

- **Valuation**: Concern that the house is going to be sold at a price
  that is below the market price 🡪 difficult to figure out market price
  for a unique structure 🡪 will need appraisers, etc.

## Criminal & Civil Enforcement

 

- Trespass to land was not a traditional common law crime unless the
  trespass involved breach of peace. Principal fxn of criminal trespass
  statute is to create an alt to owner self-help.

- **Criminal Trespass** 🡪 **three types:**

- 1\) Trespass 🡪 protects against physical intrusions of property

- 2\) Ejectment 🡪 if you want to avoid adverse possession of person who
  has taken your property

- 3\) Nuisance 🡪 protects **use & quiet enjoyment** of your property

- [NOTE]{.underline}: Principal function of criminal trespass is to
  create an ***[alternative]{.underline}*** to "self-help"

  - Calling the cops is a safe, reasonable alternative to resorting to
    physically confronting the disagreeable party in person

  - Police officer less likely to overreact and encounter resistance

  - Wide availability of police which suggests "self-help" should be
    prohibited as a means of enforcing the right because police officers
    can handle situations safely

## Self-Help Enforcement

- Trespass protects possession + Property owners are entitled to take a
  variety of ***[reasonable]{.underline}*** steps to protect/enforce
  property rights without direct involvement of the legal system.

- **Rights v. Privileges**

  - **[Right]{.underline}** = a claim that one person has against
    others, which corresponds to a duty that these others have toward
    the one with the right

    - Ex) A owns a land. A has ***right*** to exclude B, C, D.

  - **[Privilege]{.underline}** = a freedom to act in certain ways w/o
    interference from others, corresponds to a "right" in the others to
    interfere with the one exercising the privilege.

    - Self-help = privilege associated with ownership.

    - Ex) If A owns a land, then A has a privilege to engage in a
      variety of defensive measures to protect the land from B,C,D.

    - Note: Privilege *[permits]{.underline}* but does *[not
      compel]{.underline}* a person to do certain things.

      - Ex) homeowner is permitted to engage in self-help but is not
        required to.

**SELF HELP IMPERMISSIBLE FOR COMMERCIAL LEASES/REAL PROPERTY**

**Berg v. Wiley (1978): [self-help is not permissible as a matter of law
for the retaking of commercial leases even if entry is
peaceful]{.mark}**

- **FACTS**: Landlord using self-help + changing locks on P to terminate
  P's trespass of **commercial property** was not ok

  - Court overturns common law rule (D loses under either rule)

<!-- -->

- **HOLDING:** Tenant wins

- **MAJORITY'S REASONING:**

<!-- -->

- Court: [**[Judicial process]{.underline}** is the only lawful means to
  dispossess a tenant who has not abandoned nor voluntarily surrender
  but who claims possession and rights adverse to those claimed by
  landlord. 🡪 Modern Common Law Rule]{.mark}

  - ~~**Old, *[abandoned]{.underline}* rule:** a landlord can resort to
    self-help, instead of judicial proceedings, if both (1) landlord is
    legally entitled to possession upon the tenant's breach/termination
    of lease AND (2) the reentry was peaceful (= no actual violence or
    possibility of disrupting the peace)~~

    - ~~Here, the reentry by the landlord was ***[NOT
      peaceful]{.underline}*** b/c there was a history of vigorous
      dispute + animosity between the parties.~~

  <!-- -->

  - **Modern rule: Self help is never available** to dispossess a tenant
    who is still in possession of property and has not abandoned or
    voluntarily surrendered it. Landlord has to resort to judicial
    process.

- **Policy**: Any form of self-help has the potential to catalyze a
  violent breach of peace. This modern approach is justified to avoid
  any future potentially violent encounters between landlord and tenant.

**SELF-HELP PERMISSIBLE FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY**:

 

**William v. Ford Motor Company[: SELF-HELP PERMISSIBLE FOR PERSONAL
PROPERTY IF THERE WAS NO BREACH OF PEACE]{.mark}**

- **FACTS**: Couple bought a car and got divorced 🡪 court ordered that
  wife (P) would get car while husband needed to make the car payments 🡪
  husband stopped paying 🡪 Ford said that they would repossess the car 🡪
  husband signed the papers and Ford repossessed the car 🡪 P woke up
  while they were repossessing the car and went out to talk to them 🡪
  Repo folks left the car and P filed a police report for a stolen car
  and sues

- **MAJORITY'S REASONING:**

- Article 9 of UCC allows repossession without judicial process **if it
  can be done w/o breach of peace** → traditional common law also allows
  self-help when peaceable

- Court ruled in favor of Ford bc (1) men weren't
  oppressive/violent, (2) complied w/request for personal items, (3)
  Cathy wasn't physically violent

  - Policy: UCC says that [**[repossessing without judicial process is
    permissible if it can be done without the breach of the
    peace.]{.underline}** Test for this is **[whether actual violence
    occurred]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

- **DISSENT:**

- Says that jury should have been allowed to decide whether there was a
  risk of violence

- Says that repo people should be req to retreat when **(1) detection
  occurs and (2) confrontation actually happens**

- Key with secured debt is: creditors need to be able to get their hands
  on the property so they can auction it off

  - Real property: doesn\'t move 🡪 don't need to move quickly to secure
    it

  - Personal property: moves 🡪 need to act quickly, higher risk

- **Most courts agree w/ majority in *Williams* and allow for self-help
  for repossession of personal property**

  - Some courts have also recently allowed self-help in commercial
    landlord tenant disputes as well in contrast w/ *Berg* → theory
    being less tense, less chance of violence in commercial dispute v.
    personal / home dispute

- 

## DEFENSES/LIMITS ON THE RIGHT TO EXCLUDE: Necessity

**Ploof v. Putnam (V.T. 1908): [exception to right to exclude when
trespass upon land is necessary ]{.mark}**

- **FACTS:** Putnams (D) owned an island in Lake Champlain + a dock
  attached thereto 🡪 P was sailing a sloop on the lake with his wife and
  two children 🡪 violent tempest placed property and persons in danger
  of destruction 🡪 to save property and life, P moored sloop to D's dock
  🡪 D's servant unmoored the sloop 🡪 tempest drove sloop onto shore,
  destroying it and causing injuries to P + family

- Two counts: trespass by D's servant for unmooring the sloop +
  negligent breach of duty of D by his servant to permit P to moor sloop
  on dock

- **RULE: necessity may justify what would otherwise be a trespass**

- **COURT'S REASONING:**

- **[Necessity will justify what would otherwise be a trespass,
  applicable in cases that people intentionally enter onto another's
  land to save their own lives.]{.mark}**

  - **If greater harm can be avoided, then there's no wrongful act** =
    no liability.

- **Vincent v. Lake Erie** 🡪 private necessity provides an incomplete
  privilege to trespass (The cost for damages must be borne by the
  intruder); D was justified in keeping the boat tied but that D must
  pay the plaintiff for the damage caused to the dock.

## 

## Limits: Public Accommodations

- **Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000a
  (2000):** provides that all persons are "entitled to the full and
  equal enjoyment of places of public accommodation w/o discrimination
  or segregation on ground of race, color, religion, or national origin.

<!-- -->

- Public accommodation law has narrowed to apply solely to inns and
  restaurants:

  - \(1\) Must serve anyone who requested service - no right to exclude
    them

- \(2\) Obligated to charge reasonable prices 🡪 can't exclude on the
  basis that someone didn\'t want to pay an unreasonable price Public
  policy can limit a property owner's right to exclude b/c the exclusion
  might contradict the basic principles of societal well-being. This is
  the most general exception to the right to exclude + always subject to
  a balancing test of competing social interest.

- The more that **private property is used for monetary gain** by means
  of **the** use of that property **by the public**, the property owner
  **must accommodate constitutionally protected rights**.

## Limits: Public Policy 

- Public policy can limit a property owner's right to exclude b/c the
  exclusion might contradict the basic principles of societal
  well-being. This is the most general exception to the right to
  exclude + always subject to a balancing test of competing social
  interest.

- The more that **private property is used for monetary gain** by means
  of **the** use of that property **by the public**, the more that the
  property owner **must accommodate constitutionally protected rights**.

- 

**State v. Shack, 277 A.2d 369 (1971)**[: **Property rights of exclusion
are limited by public necessity**]{.mark} **🡪 human values/rights \>
right to exclude (outlier case)**

- **FACTS**: Migrant workers do not have economic + political power,
  like *Carolene Products* case, need to protect minorities rights bc
  they are not protected by democratic system

<!-- -->

- **RULE:** **Right to exclude does not bar access to government
  services for migrant workers**

- **MAJORITY'S REASONING:** Provides several different considerations
  that it thinks points in the same direction

- **Property rights do not extend to control the livers of those who
  live on the property.**

  - X trespass when reps from recognized charitable groups enter private
    land to provide govt aid to those workers who need it.

  - Invokes the standard of **[the property owner can have the stranger
    evicted upon trespass as long as the owner's interest in protecting
    his autonomy is sufficiently great and the interest of other persons
    in abrogating the owner's right to exclude are not more
    important]{.underline}**. Tenants have the right to quiet enjoyment
    that includes the right to receive visitors

  - *Even if the property owner objects, **govt people may enter
    property to provide govt services**.*

- Reasoning:

  - **(1) "Property rights serve human values"** + contract law
    prohibits people to sign contracts to constrain things that are
    essential to their dignity 🡪 Property law will not let that happen.

  - **(2)** Entry by legal service group did not violate any property
    rights and trespass statute. Having opened up his property to house
    farmworkers, D **[impliedly consented]{.underline}** to entries by
    at least some visitors.

  - **(3) Necessity exceptions here: Medical care is a basic human
    necessity.** . It's unthinkable to farmer to exclude services that
    are relevant to the wellbeing. Also, "farmer must allow press to
    meet."

**Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid**

- SCOTUS held that it was a per se regulatory taking - government can do
  it, but it\'s **constitutionally req to pay compensation** to the
  owners for entry

**Uston v. Resorts International Hotel (1982):** the more open to public
use private property is, more private property owner has to accommodate
rights of general public to come onto property; [Common law right to
exclude is limited by **competing right of reasonable access to public
places**]{.mark}

- **FACTS:** Resorts International Hotel (Resorts) (D) refused to allow
  Kenneth Uston (P) near the blackjack tables at its casino because P's
  strategy of card counting increased his odds of winning. 🡪 P brought
  suit claiming D had no right to exclude him simply because of his
  playing strategy.

- The lower court ruled in favor of D. 🡪 P appealed.

- **MAJORITY'S REASONING:** Court held that any common law right of
  exclusion had been abrogated by the Casino Control Act

  - But Court said that they would give Resorts International 90 days to
    go back to the Casino Control Commission to request change in the
    rule

- Resorts **may not** ***[unreasonably]{.underline}*** exclude Uston
  from its casino. An individual has a right of reasonable access to
  property open to the public. The reasonableness of a decision to
  exclude an individual must be determined on a case-by-case basis. 

  - [[Rule:]{.underline} A person has a right of reasonable access to
    property open to the public **as long as the person does not
    threaten the security of the premises and its occupants and his
    actions do not disrupt the regular and essential operations of the
    premises.** ]{.mark}

  - [Policy:]{.underline} **The right of reasonable access extends to
    all businesses open to the public. There is a duty to serve members
    of the public without discrimination unless there is a good reason
    not to provide services to an individual**.

**RULES VS STANDARDS**

- **Rules (see Pile v. Pedrick**) are simple, general, inexpensive to
  apply but may be expensive to create

<!-- -->

- **Standards (see State v. Shack)**: looser, general, maybe vaguer;
  built with some purpose

  - **Advantages:** (1) Generate appropriate results in a wider range of
    circumstances (2) Relatively cheap

  - **Disadvantages:** (1) Expensive to apply and (2) more complex bc
    you people don't know what corresponding rights are 🡪 chilling
    effect w/underutilization of prop

[]{#_Toc131516162 .anchor}**[Limits: Anti-discrimination]{.underline}**

Exception on the Rights to exclude and create restrictive covenant that
property owners otherwise would have.

- Anti-discrimination law is perhaps the most impt exception to the
  general right of a property owner to exclude others

- Owners of public accommodation is subject to antidiscrimination rules
  at common law.

- Enforcement of trespass law motivated racial prejudice is state
  action.

**Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948[): judicial enforcement of
racially restrictive covenants violates the 14^th^ Amendment (Equal
Protection Clause)]{.mark}**

- **FACTS**: Feb 16, 1911, 30/39 owners of prop in St. Louis signed an
  agreement that restricted use and occupancy of property for 50 yrs to
  Caucasian persons 🡪 district included 57 parcels of land 🡪 5 of the
  parcels were owned by Negros 🡪 Shelley (petitioners) received a
  warranty deed to the parcel in question in 1945 + TC found that
  petitioners had no actual knowledge of the restrictive agreement at
  the time of purchase 🡪 respondents brought suit in Circuit Court
  praying that Shelleys be restrained from taking possession of the
  property + for divestment of title 🡪 TC denied relief on grounds that
  restrictive agreement had never become final and complete bc it was
  intention that it would not become effective until signed by all
  property owners in district + sigs of all owners had not been obtained

- SC of Missouri rev'd 🡪 directed TC to grant the relief for which
  respondents had requested, claiming that it didn't violate rights 🡪
  Shelleys petitioned

- Shelleys relied on contention that judicial enforcement of the
  restrictive agreements violates the 14^th^

- **REASONING:**

<!-- -->

- 14th (Equal Protection) prohibits discriminatory ***state*** action
  that interfered with rights to acquire property or sell property or
  dispose of property in some other way. Racially discriminative
  enforcement in judicial proceeding is considered state action. Civil
  Rights Act said that all citizens shall have the same right in every
  state and territory as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to
  inherit, purchase, lease, and sell real property.

  - **[State action exists]{.underline}** in the ***judicial enforcement
    of a racially restrictive covenant*** to block the sale of home from
    a willing seller to an African American buyer

    - Judicial enforcement = state action = violation of the 14th
      Amendment.

  - Racially restrictive covenants are unconstitutional.

**The Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the CRA of 1968**

- The number of protected class has increased.

- Provides limitations on what you can do with your property

  - Limit whom you can refuse to sell or rent to

  - Limit advertising preferences (race, religion, etc)

    - Ex) "if you are a republic, you cannot apply"

- **Mrs. Murphy exception**: For multi-family homes, if owner lives in
  the place and it houses less than 4 families, then the FHA does not
  apply

>  

**Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommate.com, LLC, 666
F.3d 1216 (2012)**

- **FACTS**: Roommates is a website that helps roommates find each other
  🡪 users create profiles including characteristics like sex and sexual
  orientation, that are then used to match users with others with those
  characteristics 🡪 Fair Housing Councils of San Fernando Valley and San
  Diego (FHCs) sued Roommate in fed ct, alleging that it violated FHA

- Idea is that your home is special, and inside your home, you should
  feel safe where you are

- **COURT'S REASONING:** said that the **[FHA provisions do not apply to
  roommates]{.mark}**

- (**1) Statutory interpretation**: makes practical sense to interpret
  **dwelling as an independent living unit, such that it stops at the
  doorway**, and not to interpret it to apply to the bedroom (home as
  somewhere you can be yourself wherever you are within that place)

- **(2)** SCOTUS has said that **Constitution protects rights of
  intimate association**, which also protects rights of refusing
  intimate association

  - **(a)** Look at size, purpose, exclusivity, etc.

  - **Policy**: danger of not allowing people to refuse intimate
    association

- **(3)** when statute should be interpreted in a way that avoids
  constitutional difficulties, then they should adopt the narrower
  reading that excludes roommate selection[]{#_Toc131516163 .anchor}

# CEDING SOVEREIGNTY

- As a prop owner, the right to exclude $\neq \ $you have an obligation
  to exclude

  - Sometimes owner may wish to waive that duty 🡪 may give permission
    for another to come onto their property 🡪 license (temp and
    revocable)

  - irrevocable = Leases and easements

## Licenses

- **Licenses =** way to waive the right to exclude

  - Temporary, revocable

  - Less durable than other types, more transitory, more difficult to be
    revoked

- Licenses are NOT interests in land, so statute of frauds does not
  apply

  - Licenses do not need to be in writing, you do not need to put it in
    writing to have someone come to your house

**Wood v. Leadbitter (1845):** [Licenses are **by nature revocable at
any time** BUT licenses coupled with grants are **irrevocable until
grant is complete**]{.mark}

- **FACTS**: At time of trespass, Wood (P) was in a close of Lord
  Eglintoun, and the D (servant of Lord Eglintoun) laid hands on P to
  remove him but did not use unnecessary violence

- At time of removal, P was in close with Eglintoun's permission, but D
  traversed that leave and license

- At the time, P was in an area within a race-course for which tickets
  were sold à assumed they were sold with the lord's privity

  - P had purchased a ticket and was in the stand during the races when
    D told him to leave 🡪 P had not misconducted himself 🡪 P refused 🡪 D
    forced him out without returning the ticket price 🡪 TC found for D

  - Mr. Jervis obtained a rule nisi to set aside the verdict for
    misdirection, on the ground that under the circ, Lord E must be
    taken to have given P leave to come into and remain in the enclosure
    and that the leave was not revocable without returning the guinea

- **MAJORITY'S REASONING:**

- Distinguish btw 2 different scenarios:

  - \(1\) **[Bare license]{.mark}** 🡪 revocable

  - \(2\) **[License + a grant]{.mark}** 🡪 Irrevocable (licensor is
    defeated from revoking a grant)

    - Basic idea with the couch hypo: by virtue of having made this
      sale, you are blocked from revoking the license until the person
      you sold it to has a reasonable opportunity to come get the hypo

- Here, the Court says that it\'s just a license so the servant is
  permitted to eject Wood

- State of the law today:

  - Mere licenses in general are revocable at any time, including
    licenses to see things, like shows, unless coupled with a grant

## 

## Licenses: Equitable Enforcement

## 

## Bailments

## 

- Temporary transfer of custody from the owner (the bailor) to another
  (the bailee)

- A way of relinquishing control over property for limited periods of
  time

- Bailment cases arise when something goes awry

- **Two questions:**

  - \(1\) Does a bailment exist?

  - \(2\) If a bailment has been created, what duty of care did the
    bailee have with respect to that item?

- When a bailment is created, it involves two parties - person who
  receives the property is the bailee

**Allen v. Hyatt Regency-Nashville Hotel, 668 S.W.2d 286 (1984): A
bailment relationship is implied between a parking garage and a customer
where the customer has a reasonable expectation that the bailee will
keep their property safe; Policy approach;** Garage owner **(1) better
situated to protect a parked car** than a driver was and **(2) better
situated to distribute cost of protection** via parking fees across
multiple people

 

- **FACTS**: The Hyatt Regency---Nashville Hotel (Hyatt) (D) owns and
  operates a hotel in Nashville. In the rear of the hotel, there is a
  parking garage that spans several stories. 🡪 Allen's husband (D)
  parked Allen's car in the garage. 🡪 to enter the garage, D took a
  ticket from a machine situated at the entrance of the garage, which
  opened the security gate 🡪 D drove to the fourth floor, parked and
  locked the vehicle, and exited the garage with the key. 🡪 Several
  hours later, D returned, only to find that the car was gone. The
  courts below held that a bailment relationship was created when D
  parked and locked the car in the Hyatt's garage. 🡪 D parked in the
  Hyatt garage because he thought that it was safer, but when he came
  back, it was gone 🡪 sues the hotel

<!-- -->

- **MAJORITY'S REASONING**:

- Positive advantage for the P if there is a bailment here 🡪 Black
  Letter Reason: statute presumes that if there was a bailment, then
  there is a presumption of negligence against the bailee (harder for D
  to defend)

<!-- -->

- Court holds that there was a bailment HERE, despite the fact that on
  the ticket, the garage said that there was no bailment

- Court invokes Tennessee precedents

  - Bellboy went joyriding \--\> ct held that it was a bailment

  - Car stolen from attended parking lot \--\> ct held bailment

  - Open and unattended parking lot \--\> ct found no bailment

- Court gives several facts:

  - \(1\) commercial enclosed, indoor, attended garage

  - \(2\) there was an attendant controlling the exit

  - \(3\) there were regular security controls

<!-- -->

- Court gives policy reasons for thinking that these facts do indicate
  that there is a bailment

- **RULE: Policy approach;** Garage owner **(1) better situated to
  protect a parked car** than a driver was and **(2) better situated to
  distribute cost of protection** via parking fees across multiple
  people

- Place burden of avoiding harms on the person who is best situated to
  carry that burden

<!-- -->

- Here: Who should bear the risk that a car has been stolen?

  - Compare ability that hotel has with ability that the car owner has

    - Hotel can distribute costs across many cars

      - Hire a security guard to guard the cars \--\> cheaper for the
        hotel

- **DISSENT:**

- Traditional property law lens 🡪 look for [traditional bailment
  requirements:]{.mark}

  - [Whether the vehicle\'s operator has delivered the vehicle in such a
    way that he has: **Relinquished exclusive control, possession, and
    dominion**]{.mark}

- Dissent concludes no bailment here because Allen had not delivered the
  car here and had not relinquished control

  - Ticket didn\'t ID the vehicle 🡪 no way garage attendant could even
    identify

  - Driver retained the ignition key 🡪 presentation of ticket was solely
    to allow calculation of charges

  - Cashier wasn\'t req to be on duty at all times

**The Bailee's Duty of Care**

- Key: Joseph Story\'s interpretation of the doctrine

  - \(1\) for the **sole benefit of the bailor**, the law requires only
    **slight diligence** on the part of the bailee, and makes him
    **[answerable only for gross neglect]{.underline}**;

  - \(2\) for **sole benefit of bailee**, the law requires **great
    diligence on the part of the bailee, and makes him responsible for
    slight neglect**;

  - \(3\) **reciprocally beneficial to both parties**, the law req
    **ordinary diligence** on the part of the bailee, and makes him
    **responsible for ordinary neglect**

- [Law also seems to be stricter about bailees who misdeliver goods than
  they are when goods are lost]{.underline}, stolen, or destroyed while
  held in custody of the bailee for return to the true owner

**Cowen v. Pressprich, 192 N.Y.S. 242 (1992): [RULE IS voluntary bailees
have reasonable duty of care, but involuntary bailees have no duty to
return, only need to take reasonable means to return, unless they
voluntarily took it or performed a wrongful act]{.mark};** duty of care
differs for involuntary/voluntary bailments, courts are likely more
lenient for damage or loss and NOT lenient for misdelivery

- **FACTS:**

- Stock-exchange brokers, Cowen (P) agreed to sell and deliver bond to
  Pressprich (D). 🡪 Ps didn't realize they sent wrong bond 🡪After
  placing the bond in the slot, the sellers' messenger quickly left the
  building. 🡪 Ds realized that the bond had been delivered by mistake 🡪
  The employee mistakenly handed bond to wrong messenger, who never
  returned it to Cowen 🡪 Ps sued for conversion

- **MAJORITY'S REASONING:**

- Specific context of mis-delivery

- Delivery for a voluntary bailment is an absolute duty of care →
  delivery to wrong person is not excused for any reason, good faith,
  innocence, etc.

  - Not unfair to D bc D also failed to use **reasonable measures** to
    return the bond

    - Could have called P, could have sent their own messenger

  - Implies a **duty of reasonable care**

  - **[It is the duty of the voluntary bailee to deliver the article to
    the right person]{.mark}**

- **DISSENT \[**[actual result of the case]{.mark}\]:

- Says this is an involuntary bailment 🡪 taking steps to divest oneself
  of incorrectly received items does not constitute voluntary bailment

  - window slot wasn\'t an effective agreement to accept just any bond,
    it was an invitation to deliver the correct bond

- You can\'t impose an obligation on someone by giving someone something
  against their will 🡪 **involuntary bailee has no liability, as long as
  you use reasonable means to return the item 🡪** sounds like you have a
  duty of reasonable care

- **Lee: both majority and dissent seem to feel the tug of
  reasonableness**

- Later that year the appellate division reversed the holding 🡪
  dissent\'s opinion became the majority holding 🡪 Pressprich (D)
  won[]{#_Toc131516167 .anchor}

**[Justice Story's three part analysis of duty of care Bailee owns a
bailor]{.underline}**

- Bailee = temp possessor / bailor = person who gave item up temporarily

- Duty of care depends on the **purpose the bailment was created**

  - Courts are also stricter about misdelivered bailments v. damage /
    destruction of bailments

## Abandonment

**Pocono Springs Civic Association, Inc. v. MacKenzie, 🡪 cannot abandon
real property**

- Facts: MacKenzies bought the land w/plans to develop it for a sewage
  system 🡪 ultimately fails 🡪 Discovers standard alt is a septic tank,
  but you can\'t install septic tanks as well

- Court says that it\'s not good enough

  - PA has a definition of abandoned property \--\> quotes from earlier
    PA case that pertained to abandonment of personal property

  <!-- -->

  - In PA, cts have held that [abandoned \[PERSONAL\] property]{.mark}
    is found where the owner:

    - \(1\) voluntarily relinquished all right, title, claim, and
      possession

    - \(2\) with the intention of terminating his ownership,

    - \(3\) but without vesting it in any other person and

    - \(4\) with the intention of not reclaiming further possession or
      resuming ownership, possession, or enjoyment

  <!-- -->

  - Court said that in PA, perfect title of real property cannot be
    abandoned

<!-- -->

- Reasoning: Here, D failed to fulfill element #1, he tried to, but
  failed

- Common law prohibits abandonment bc

  - Abandonment could encourage socially inefficient behavior

    - Making a toxic mess + then leaving it

    - Avoiding internalizing costs you created by using property as you
      did

 

## Destruction

**Eyerman v. Mercantile Trust Co. (1975): cannot destroy real property**

 

- **Facts**: Testator's wish in will to destroy building is not upheld,
  neighbors win injunction

- Majority: Court says destruction was unnecessary

  - Property value would be diminished, neighbors values would be
    diminished

  - Need for housing in area

  - Property has historical value + demolition would affect aesthetic
    appeal of neighborhood

- **Dissent:** testator freedom, they should be able to do what they
  want

  - *Prof. Lee also discussed horrible things that happened in house,
    maybe reasoning why she wanted to knock it down, isn't that her
    right?*

## Destruction: "Personal Property"

## 

## Transfer: Statute of Frauds

## 

**[Justifications for Transfer]{.underline}**

- Enhances autonomy

  - Allows you to get rid of things that you do not want + acquire
    things that you do want

- Promotes efficiency

  - Allows society to make mutually beneficial exchanges → wealthy
    society

  - Win-win trade situations

- Enhances power of owners because it enables them to designate the
  successor

  - Controversial justification

    - Counter-argument → generational wealth is a bad thing

  - Can work in a bad way like in *Shelley v. Kramer*, can also work in
    a good way

**[Common law favors restraint on alienation]{.underline}**

- In favor of advantages to exchange, absolute restraint on alienage is
  void

  - X is not allowed to transfer property to Y on condition Y will never
    transfer it to anyone else

    - Law will not enforce the transfer w/ this condition, the restraint
      is not valid (transfer might still be valid)

<!-- -->

- In several contexts, law will recognize a transfer as having occurred
  ONLY IF:

  - There has been **actual delivery** to the recipient of either the
    thing itself or some evidence of title to the thing

    - For a gift to be legally effective, to have legally been given,
      you have to deliver the item to the recipient or alternatively a
      deed of gift

      - You have to transfer a **thing**

    - Deeds must be signed, sealed, and delivered

**Transfers of real property: Statute of Frauds applies**

- **Must be in writing**

- Exceptions: short term leases and Louisiana

  - Only state jurisdiction that has civil law rather than common law

<!-- -->

- Several contexts: law will recognize transfers

  - Gifts: you have to deliver either the item itself or a deed of the
    gift (must be signed, sealed, and delivered)

>  

## Transfer: Delivery 

**Irons v. Smallpiece (1819):** British case → no transfer through
verbal gift unless there is **actual delivery of item**

- Father did not actually give son possession of horses, so son could
  not recover on trover action

**Foster v. Reiss (1955):** → no gift bc there was no actual delivery
while donor was alive

- Facts: Ethel\'s will gave \$1 to her husband and the residue of her
  estate to her descendants 🡪 Descendants sue to get everything the
  husband obtained outside of the \$1 🡪 Husband claimed that they were
  gifts causa mortis

- **Majority**: No gift because there was **no delivery while donor was
  alive**

  - Rice did not deliver items to husband before she died, thus gift was
    not effective

  - There must be an affirmative act by the owner to the receiver

  - The note demonstrated an **intent** to give a gift, but NOT enough
    to constitute a transfer

    - **You must have actual delivery!**

    - Note is meaningless

- **[Dissent]{.underline}**

  - Intent to transfer is clear, where are we being absurd and requiring
    this symbolic, ceremonial physical transfer? Note she left was
    enough

    - To require somehow husband to bring stuff in hospital room is
      ridiculous + impractical

## Transfer: Land Transactions 

\(1\) Negotiation stage

\(2\) Contract execution

- Buyer makes an offer in writing

- Seller accepts the offer \--\> creates a contract

- Contract now binds the two parties until the closing

- Statute of Frauds applies: must be writing and must be signed

- At this point, seller remains in possession of the property because no
  transfer has happened yet

\(3\) Title Examination

- Property will be examined to check to make sure that seller can
  actually sell the thing

- Part of loan/mortgage assessment process

- If there isn\'t good title, the title insurance companies will pay out

  - Just checking the records to make sure that everything\'s
    appropriate there

- Recording system: Happens in the US

  - No checks for quality

- Alternative: Registration system

  - Actually does an investigation, and only after title passes
    investigation will it get registered

\(4\) Closing

- Parties executes the documents and transfer takes place \--\> contract
  ceases to govern and contract merges with the deed

- Three Types of Deeds are Given

  - General Warranty: gives the most guarantee from seller to the
    purchaser

    - Seller provides covenant that seller is providing good title (no
      encumbrances, seller will legally defend attacks on title, and
      etc.)

  - Quit Claim

    - Polar opposite

    - Says that the seller is transferring to the buyer whatever it is
      that the seller actually has

    - Seller is forfeiting the seller\'s own claims to the property

  - Special Warranty

    - Intermediate

    - Gives a more limited warranty against title defects due to actions
      by the seller

**Note on Land Demarcation**

- Need some way of indicating where property actually is

  - When you have legal disputes, this becomes essential

  - Want to know what exactly it is that you\'re buying

- Two Systems of Records

  - [Metes and bounds system]{.mark}: Use various landmarks and
    directions based on the landmarks to indicate the extent of the
    property

    - Pretty common in eastern states (older states in the US) 🡪 fairly
      straightforward to administer

    - Disadvantages:

      - Landmarks can change (move, disappear, etc.)

      - Sometimes the beginning point and the end point don\'t coincide

      - Sometimes information is just inaccurate

      - Whole point of going into court is to get them resolved

  - [Rectangular survey]{.mark}: Divided up property based on latitude
    and longitude

    - Disadvantages:

      - More costly to set up

      - Doesn\'t work so well on rugged terrain that may not be
        naturally amenable to a grid

    - Advantages

      - Does describe the land with more certainty

      - Easier to use once it\'s set up

      - It may be that rectangular bounds system is economically
        superior to metes and bounds

## Transfer: Nemo Dat 

**NEMO DAT**: Basic principle for transferring ownership

- **derivation principle:** transferee's rights derive from those of the
  transferor

  - A is unable to transfer that which A does not own

    - \"selling someone the Brooklyn Bridge\"

  - "prior in time is prior in right"

Basic rule is **Nemo Dat** - can\'t transfer what you don\'t have
(nested exceptions)

- **EXCEPT** if your recipient was a BFP for value

  - **EXCEPT** if OG transfer from A to B gave only void title rather
    than voidable title

    - **EXCEPT** if A was negligent 🡪 BFP exception might apply

## Transfer: Good Faith Purchasers

>  

**THE GOOD FAITH PURCHASER: Exception to nemo dat**

** **

**BONAFIDE PURCHASER (BFP)**

- If A sells goods to B 🡪 B sells those goods to C but there was a
  defect in the transaction between A and B, such that B wasn\'t
  actually entitled to the goods

- Who is entitled to the goods?

  - ***Nemo dat*** would imply that A is, because A never actually had
    anything to transfer to B

  - However, this is not what the law does 🡪 under some circumstances, C
    is entitled to the goods:

- \(1\) C\'s purchase must have been done in good faith

- \(2\) C must have given value in exchange for the goods

  - C was a good faith purchaser for value

    - Why make A unhappy rather than C

      - Facilitates transfers

      - If either C or A are going to lose 🡪 **[A is better situated to
        avoid problems]{.underline}** in transaction between A and B

      - Additionally, if C has it and is entitled to it, then if D
        purchases it from C, then D is ok 🡪 Domino Theory

- Both nemo dat and the BFP are part of the UCC

  - Purchaser of goods acquires all title which the transferor had the
    power to transfer

  - A person with voidable title has power to transfer good title to a
    good faith purchaser for value 🡪 applies only to voidable title

    - Void title is still subject to nemo dat (i.e. acquired through
      theft)

  - \"Voidable title\":

    - The delivery was in exchange for a bounced-check

    - Delivery was procured through fraud (punishable as larcenous)

  - UCC defines purchaser to include sales, leases, gifts, but it has to
    be a good faith purchase **[for value]{.underline}** for BFP

>  

**Kotis v. Nowlin Jewelry, Inc. (1992)**:** [Whether purchase was in
good-faith is a subjective test;]{.mark} purchaser who has notice of
defect is not a bonafide purchaser[; voluntary purchase through fraud is
voidable transfer]{.mark}**

- Facts: Example of applying the UCC approach to personal property 🡪
  Kotis bought watch from someone who paid with a fraudulent check
  🡪Nowlins sues, seeking a declaratory judgment that Nowlins is the sole
  owner of the watch 🡪 Kotis filed a counterclaim

- Majority: Court says that Kotis does not qualify as a good faith buyer

- Implementing Texas\'s UCC

  - \(1\) is Kotis a voluntary purchaser? YES

    - Note that difference btw theft and fraud is that theft isn\'t a
      voluntary transaction \[[**void transfer**\],]{.mark} but a
      swindle is a voluntary transaction \[**[voidable
      transfer]{.mark}**\]

    - bc Kotis acquired the watch through a swindle, he had voidable
      title

  - \(2\) Did Kotis actually believe that his purchase was lawful? NO

    - Kotis did not act in good-faith

      - Subjective test, rather than an objective test

    - Kotis testified that he lied when he spoke to Nowlin, and that he
      had already purchased the watch when he called 🡪 ct didn't buy it

<!-- -->

- If you have notice of the defect in the transaction, you don\'t
  qualify as a BFP

- Three types of notice

  - \(1\) Actual notice

  - \(2\) Constructive notice

  - \(3\) Record notice

  - \(4\) Inquiry notice: There are enough facts out there that a
    reasonable person would have known to ask more questions

- The proper scope of the BFP exception is unknown

  - Variations based on diff cultural presuppositions about individual
    initiative, etc.

**Hauck v. Crawford (1953):** [Negligence of signer where there is fraud
in the factum may make deed voidable 🡪 BFP applies]{.mark}

- Facts: Case involving real property; P told he was signing a mineral
  lease 🡪 ended up being a mineral deed

- Majority: Court notes a distinction between 2 types of fraud

  - **Fraud in the factum/execution**: relates to misrepresentation of
    the contents of the document, by which one is induced to sign for
    something other than that which they are signing

    - Negligence on the signer is irrelevant 🡪 deed was void, not
      voidable, because it involved fraud in the factum

      - Ordinarily, nemo dat would void any subsequent transfer

      - Court seems to expand protections for BFP beyond the rule 🡪
        Plaintiff\'s negligence may be relevant🡪 Plaintiff should bear
        the brunt of negligence rather than BFP 🡪 deed is voidable

        - BFP would be applicable

  - **Fraud in the inducement**: Victim knows what he or she is signing
    but was deceived by fraud into thinking it was a good bargain

    - Court said need to determine if plaintiff was negligent

##  Transfer: Proving Ownership 

>  

- The less uncertainty there is, the better 🡪 easier for people to know
  what to buy 🡪 more certainty 🡪 makes property more valuable

- Ancient method of proving ownership was possession

  - Problems: Are the possessors necessarily entitled to own it?

  - Advantages: For sorting out personal property, possession may
    actually be more effective because personal property actually moves

- Alternative to Possession:

  - [Recording systems]{.mark}

    - Works better than possession based systems when property is
      valuable + when the property is infrequently transferred

    - Real property is one of the paradigms

    - Title recording for chattels/personal property is rare because
      personal property is often less valuable

    - Note that the clerk\'s role is purely ministerial \--\> clerk will
      record it even if its false

    - Today, almost every jurisdiction in the US uses a recording system

      - It provides constructive notice to all purchasers 🡪 can defeat a
        claim of BFP

      - You would have been deemed to have had constructive notice so
        long as it was recorded in the recording office, even if you
        didn\'t know

  - [Registration System]{.mark}

    - The clerk actually does the investigation to determine if there
      are defects in the title 🡪 once its registered, no further
      inspection is needed

# SERVITUDES

- []{#_Toc131516177 .anchor}Involve a partial relinquishment of title
  rights

- We see this in licenses and bailments (transfer)

  - Last for a fairly short period of time

  - Servitudes create **limited, durable transfers of property rights**

- **\"the bundle of rights\" theory** 🡪 Dominant theoretical
  understanding of property rights

  - Law of rights that can rearranged

  - Basic idea is that ownership of property is a collection of rights,
    privileges, powers, duties, and so forth like a bundle of sticks

- **In rem theory of property - prominent minority in past 20 years**

  - Challenges bundle of rights conception

  - There are **restraints** on the extent to which you can transfer

    - Some parts of bundle you cannot remove

    - Some parts of bundle you cannot get rid of or else you have
      destroyed the property altogether

- **Servitude Law** allows you to swap out the \"sticks\" in the bundle

  - Servitudes exist to resolve potential land use conflicts, either
    preemptively or ad hoc by agreement, sometimes in other ways

  - Servitudes are special in the property context because they can run
    with the land under certain circumstances

    - They can thus bind successor owners of the land in rem

    - Differs from contracts, which bind in personam

- Come in two main varieties:

  - **Easements**: nonpossessory right; usually waivers of the right to
    exclude

    - **[Always run with the land]{.mark}**

    - Typically **right for a particular use** rather than right to
      possession

    - **Limited purpose**

    - **Irrevocable**

    - **always bind successors**

    - Hinman v. Pacific Air Transport - Hinman was held not to have a
      right to exclude

    - Easements are durable

      - IF court awarded damages for minor encroachment in *Golden
        Press*, those damages would have purchased an easement +
        permitted D from encroaching to that extent

  - **Covenants**: usually require owners to refrain from doing
    something on their land and prescribe affirmative behavior on the
    part of the landowner

    - Broader in their protective scope

## 

## Easements

## 

- **[#1 Distinction]{.underline}**

  - An easement is either (never both) an **appurtenant easement or a
    easement in gross**

**Easements Appurtenant**

- A right to use property that is someone else's

- **Belong to a particular parcel / estate**

  - Ex: Blackacre has an appurtenant easement to go across Whiteacre's
    property to access Blackare

    - Easement benefits estate → Blackacre

    - Easement burdens another estate → Whiteacre

    - Easement is attached to both of these parcels

  - **Dominant vs. servient estates**

    - Parcel that gets the benefit = dominant estate

    - Parcel that gets burdened = servient estate

  - Owners of the estates are called **tenants**

    - Dominant + servient tenant

**Easements in Gross**

- Easements belong to **particular persons**, not particular parcels /
  estates

- Easements in gross **stay with the grantee**

- There is no dominant parcel / estate in easement in gross, there is
  only a **dominant tenant**

  - Easement stays with the dominant tenant, regardless of what property
    dominant tenant owns, even if the dominant tenant does not own any
    property at all

**[How to determine if there is an easement in gross or appurtenant
easement?]{.underline}**

- The **intent of parties** who created easement determines this

- If intent is unclear, court will decide **based on the circumstances**

  - If easement adds to use or enjoyment of neighboring property →
    likely **appurtenant**

  - If easement does NOT add to the use/enjoyment of neighboring
    property → in gross

- If court still cannot determine → **court generally favors finding
  appurtenant easement**

[]{#_Toc131516178 .anchor}**[#2 Distinction]{.underline}**

- Easements that are **affirmative**

- Easements that are **negative**

**[Transferability of easements]{.underline}**

- [Easements in gross are *sometimes* transferable]{.mark}

  - [Most courts today do not allow transfer of **recreational easements
    in gross**]{.mark}

    - Ex: getting easement in gross to fish on pond = recreational,
      grantee cannot transfer to someone else

  - Where easements in gross are transferable is if it is **of
    commercial character**

    - Ex: billboards, utility poles, railroad tracks

      - Utility poles = easements in gross owned by the utility company

## Easements: creation 

1)  **Easement by grant**

    - Buying easement (parties will cut deal)

    - MUST BE IN WRITING to satisfy SOF

<!-- -->

1)  **Easement by reservation**

- Creation of an easement by one party, expressly reserving right to
  retain an easement in property that is being transferred

- I.e. you sell property but create an easement for yourself to still
  access property

2)  **Court created easements**

    - Either **by necessity or by implication**

3)  **Easement by prescription** (prescriptive easements)

4)  **Easements by estoppel**

**[Implied Easement/Easement by Implication]{.underline}**

- Easement even in the absence of a grant

- *Sometimes also called "implications for prior use"*

- Exist to protect people who are purchasing land in subdivided property
  (new subdivisions) from being surprised that no easement actually
  exists when it would have been **reasonable for them to have thought
  an easement existed**

- **[Requirements for Implied Easements]{.underline}** *Must have all!*

1)  **Necessity:** Without easement, the grantee of the property (the
    person who acquired the subdivided property) cannot enjoy the use of
    the property for the purposes to which **similar property is
    customarily devoted**

    a)  Ex: subdivision in beachfront community, want to be able to
        access beach

    b)  This definition of necessity is **broader than the requirements
        for easement by necessity**

2)  **Obvious use prior to division of parcels:** the use that would be
    permitted by the easement has to have been obviously going on
    **before** the property was separated

**[Requirements for Easements of Necessity]{.underline}**

*Must have all!*

1)  **Common ownership:** The plots were all owned by the same person
    prior to subdivision

2)  **Severed to person:** The owner of the parcels severe done by
    conveying it to other people

3)  **Severed portion is landlocked**: the severed portion has no access
    to the **public road**

- **[Being landlocked does not = not being able to use property for your
  own use]{.mark}**

  - *Warsaw -* not being able to use driveway for your own trucking
    purpose is not landlocked when your building is right next to the
    road

  <!-- -->

  - **[Easement of Necessity doesn\'t create rights against third
    parties, only against the owner of the sold parcel]{.mark}** 🡨Schwab

- Designed to avoid having useless parcels (i.e., parcels cut off from
  roads), [unless]{.underline} the owner is the one who cut the parcel
  off from the road

  - Isolution of parcel from road **caused by the owner** of that parcel
    having sold off another parcel bars the owner from claiming an
    easement by necessity

  - *Schwab v. Timmons*

    - P was the one who landlocked themselves by selling off another
      parcel and subdividing their property → bc P caused the isolation,
      P cannot claim easement by necessity to go across D's property

[\***[Easements by necessity always terminate when necessity
ends\*]{.underline}**]{.mark}

- [If property stops being landlocked → easement by necessity goes
  away]{.mark}

>  

**Baseball Publishing Co. v. Bruton (Mass. 1938): [specific performance
allowable for easements but not licenses, where easements are not
revocable]{.mark}**

>  

- **Facts**: P contracts signboards out to other companies 🡪 D owned a
  building 🡪 P wanted to place a billboard on D\'s building 🡪 wanted to
  negotiate a contract to place a billboard on D\'s building for \$25 a
  year 🡪 P and D entered the deal 🡪 put up the sign 🡪 D constantly
  returned the checks 🡪 Bruton removed the sign in 1937 🡪 P sued for
  specific performance, claiming that the contract was a lease

- TC found that there was no lease 🡪 just a contract to grant a license
  🡪 ordered specific performance of that contract

- **Reasoning**: This is an easement NOT a license, which is just a
  waiver of a right to exclude

  - Not a license because licenses are inherently revocable (specific
    performance would be moot)

  - What we have here is an easement granted by the writing

  <!-- -->

  - \(1\) Intent: ambiguous here

  - \(2\) Enhance value of another property?

    - No 🡪 an easement in gross

<!-- -->

- So the court grants specific performance of the easement, because
  easements are not revocable

**Schwab v. Timmons, 589 N.W.2d 1 (Wis. 1999): [defined implied
easements and easements of necessity]{.mark}; geographical barriers
alone not enough for Easement of Necessity;**

- Facts: P owned land that dropped off onto a cliff, and land below
  cliff

  - P sold part of land above the cliff (next to public road) to a
    relative kept the land below 🡪 Land below did NOT have access to
    public road, so P sought easement to cut through an adjacent lot
    owned by D

- Reasoning: Court says that it doesn\'t exist in this case because
  there was no access to the road back when the parcels were divided

- **No easement by implication**

  - The breakup of the original subdividing property was in 1854

  - There was no obvious use

- **No easement by necessity**

  - The court says that the presence of geographical barriers alone are
    not enough to create an Easement of Necessity + Geographical
    barriers won\'t create that as long as you can get access to public
    roads at a reasonable expense

  - Orig. severance not land-locked and severed portion, upper parcel,
    was not land-locked

  - **Easement of Necessity doesn\'t create rights against third
    parties, only against the owner of the sold parcel**

>  

**[Prescriptive Easements/Easements by Prescription]{.underline}**

- All of the following elements must be present. Use must be:

  - **1) Open + notorious**

  - **2) Continuous**

    - Continuous use w/o landowner's interference is **presumptively
      enough to show use was adverse** so long as there was no evidence
      of permission

  - **3) Adverse**

    - If license was granted → not adverse

  - **4) For statutory period of time** (usually 5 yrs in *Warsaw*)

  - **5)** in *Warsaw,* also required that **definite line of travel was
    being used**

    - Minor variations are okay (i.e. if truck is not driving in EXACTLY
      the same path, but they can't go all over the place)

<!-- -->

- **Policy reasoning →** law encourages property owners to do something
  about use of its property if its open and notorious, either give
  permission or stop them from using, can't just ignore it

 

**Warsaw v. Chicago Metallic Ceilings, Inc. (1984): RULE**: To establish
an **easement by prescription**, the use must be **(1) open and
notorious, (2) continuous, (3) adverse, (4) for a specified period of
time (5 years here), and (6) follow a definite course and pattern**

- **Facts**: P, who tried to buy easement by grant w/ \$ but failed,
  continues to drive on D's property for \~8 years → D interferes with P
  using its loading dock

- **Majority**: Court finds P had acquired an **easement of
  prescription** from D over 25 ft. of D's property by its use of
  property

  - Here, court **required additional element - 5) definite line of
    travel being used**

    - Minor variations are okay, but can't be going all over the place

  - P did not have to compensate D for easement OR D knocking building
    down

    - D has to pay to demolish the building + building itself!

    - Court says **D would have gotten compensation if they built the
      building innocently**

      - Here, D started building as soon as P sued them, out of spite,
        trying to manipulate outcome

[Concurrence]{.underline}

- Also, D could have **prevented a prescriptive easement from being
  awarded to P by putting a sign up**

  - "Right to pass by permission + subject to control of owner"

  - Effectively makes any incursion be by permission granted by D

    - Recall, if permission → no prescriptive easement

  - Ex: plaques on the sidewalk, impossible to use the sidewalk for any
    other purpose than a sidewalk

    - "Permission by owner revocable at will"

**[Differences between Prescriptive Easements and Adverse
Possession]{.underline}**

- **No requirement of exclusivity**

  - many people can be using it

- **Time requirement might differ**

  - typically prescriptive easement will be shorter than statutory
    required time for AP

- **Characteristics are focused on use rights**

  - AP focuses on possession rights

**[Compensation for Easements]{.underline}**

- Common law rule is that you can get a prescriptive easement without
  compensating the property owner for it

  - However, some jurisdictions **require comp**

**[Easements by estoppel:]{.underline}** sometimes referred to as
irrevocable licenses

Must have all of the elements:

1)  **Permission**

    - Owner must have given someone permission to use their property in
      a [specified way]{.underline}

    - This creates a license

2)  **Reasonable expectation**

    - A reasonable person would not have expected permission to be
      revoked

3)  **Detrimental reliance**

    - The recipient of the permission must have spent \$ as a result of
      reasonably **relying on the permission**

- **In sum →** by estoppel arises when a property owners knows some
  other property owner is going to a considerable expenses in reliance
  on permission granted by the first property owner

  - If you give someone else permission to access property, knowing that
    person is going to considerable expense + reliance on that
    permission, and you DO NOT WARN THEM that you can revoke the
    permission → permission becomes **irrevocable bc it becomes an
    easement by estoppel**

**Holbrook v. Taylor (1976):** courts want to avoid **exploitation where
party has relied on easement to their economic detriment**

- P is estopped from revoking license to D to use roadway

  - P knew D was going to spend significant expense on reliance of road

  - P gave D limited permission to use road for construction

  - P suddenly started blocking roadway to D after D spent \$ improving

- **Policy reasoning →** courts want to avoid **exploitation**

 

**Distinction between Negative and Affirmative Easements**

- **Affirmative Easements**: allow dominant tenant, the holder of the
  easement, **to do something affirmative** on the servient parcel

  - i.e. an easement of access

  - Vast majority of easements are affirmative easements

- **Negative Easements**: allow dominant tenant to **prevent servient
  tenant from doing certain things** on the servient parcel

  - Traditionally, this has been limited to only several types of SMJ:

    - \(1\) stopping interference with sunlight falling on windows

    - \(2\) preventing interference with the flow of air in a defined
      channel

    - \(3\) interfering with the flow of water in an artificial channel

    - \(4\) prohibits removal of lateral support from buildings

    - \(5\) preventing people from interfering with views

  - Don\'t do much - rare to see

- Restrictions are typically accomplished today through restrictive
  covenants 🡪 won\'t have to be limited to the list under negative
  easements

##  Easements: termination

- **Straightforward way** → do so via **deed**, same idea as easement by
  grant, pay for termination

<!-- -->

- Via **merger**

  - Arises when both parcels come to be owned by the same person,
    whereupon the easement vanishes and remains nonexistent even if it
    is subsequently sold to another person

- Via **Adverse Possession**

  - AP can adversely take possession of an easement → by taking
    possession of land that you had easement for

  - Eg. building a house on the path you had an easement of access for

    - Adversarially possesses the easement + thus makes easement go away

- Via **implied abandonment through nonuse**

  - Implied abandonment from non-use

  - Non-use itself isn't enough → non-use PLUS some **affirmative acts**
    that clearly manifest the intention to relinquish the easement

  - Discontinuation of use + affirmative act that manifests intent to
    abandon the easement

    - Ex: I have an easement to walk across edge of D's property, but
      then I build a wall so I cannot do so anymore → building wall is
      affirmative act

  - Courts generally disfavor this termination claim

**[[Easements by necessity always terminate when necessity
ends\*]{.underline}]{.mark}**

- [If property stops being landlocked → easement by necessity goes
  away]{.mark}

**[Changed circumstances generally do not create a termination of
easement]{.underline}**,

- Unless the easement was stated with a **particular purpose** that is
  **now obsolete**

- [**\***If you no longer can use the easement for its purpose, it's
  terminated**\***]{.mark}

##  Easements: misuse

- *Penn Bowling* - expanded use of easement is okay, but **use with
  another parcel is misuse**

  - \**Note even w/ misuse, you don't automatically lose easement*

  - *Possible to preserve easement by severing the misuse from easement*

## 

**Penn Bowling Recreation Center, Inc. v. Hot Shoppes, Inc., 179 F.2d 64
(1949):** expanding use is permissible if the easement\'s terms don\'t
prohibit expansion, but use of easement in connection to parcel easement
was not originally granted for is **misuse of easement**; misuse does
not ordinarily forfeit the easement, but use of the easement may be
temporarily enjoined until authorized use may be permitted without
affording the opportunity for the unauthorized use; you can save the
easement by severing off the offending portion

**Facts:** Penn Bowling had received easement from Hot Shoppes; 10 years
later, Penn Bowling built a new building and continued to use easement

- D started blocking easement access, arguing easement was forfeited by
  Penn Bowling by **expanding its use** in connecting to new parcel, and
  **misused its use** by parking on easement, and did not **use it for
  the initial purpose**, which was access

  - **[P's new building blocked access to original parcel for which
    easement was originally granted]{.underline}**

  - P's use of easement also **intensified**, more trucks coming in and
    out of alleyway, more garbage

- P could get access to road via new parcel

- P's argument is its still being used for original purpose, access to
  original parcel, doesn't matter if now its also having to go through a
  building of theirs

  - Trucks might not be using easement for access, but supplies still
    are

**Holding:** expansion of use of the easement is permissible so long as
the terms of easement did not prohibit increased use, however, using the
easement on a new parcel is **impermissible**

- Mere fact they're making more **intensive use** of the easement now is
  NOT ENOUGH to constitute misuse of the easement, ASSUMING the easement
  terms didn't prohibit it

- Additional use is permissible, so long as its on the **same parcel**

  - *Some jurisdictions have reasonable person standard re: what is
    overuse*

**Remedy:** use of easement can be **temporarily enjoined** until the
burden is lifted

- Easement doesn't usually just disappear

- Whatever the misuse is, you can get temporary injunction that prevents
  use of easement UNTIL the misuse stops

  - If impossible to use it w/o misusing it, if it\'s impossible to
    sever off the increased burden that constitutes the misuse, **then
    the easement is lost altogether**

- Here, court held it *was* possible for P to stop using the easement
  with respect to Pen Bowling 2, they would have to remodel

- Whether parking was reasonable use of the easement and whether Penn
  Bowling made its own use for access impossible bc of the building →
  fact questions, tbd on remand

- Note if they moved building just a few yards onto Penn Bowling one,
  then easement wouldn't be misused! A few years is the difference here

**Policy reasoning:** Maybe court ruled in this way, as strict as it may
seem, with an intent to **decrease uncertainty,** make it more
predictable what burden of an easement is when parties are negotiating

##  Covenants: equitable servitudes

## 

- Agreements that govern **what can or cannot be done** w/ respect to
  property

- About **the use** of land

- Potential subject matter covenant covers is typically broader than
  easement

  - Because it is saying what you can or cannot do, whereas easements
    are being more specific about what you can do

  - Covenants are more **flexible** than easements

- Usually covenants are something to benefit neighbors

  - *Eyerman* - there was covenant in Kingsburg place prohibiting
    building certain things → what you can and cannot build

- Both **negative** (don't do something) covenants + **positive** (do
  something) covenants exist

  - *Kramer* → racially restrictive covenant

- [[**Purely contractual**, unlike easements]{.underline}]{.mark}

  - Are ONLY created via contract

  - [MUST BE IN WRITING, SOF APPLIES]{.mark}

- 2 different types of covenants, difference in how they are enforced
  (remedy sought for breach of them is different)

  - **Real covenants** + **equitable servitudes**

    - **[\$ damages → real covenant]{.mark}**

    - **[Injunction → equitable servitude]{.mark}**

- Covenants *sometimes* run with the land

  - Covenants run with the land when they bind successors

**Figuring out Whether a Covenant Runs with the Land**

(1) Which party is the burdened party and which party is the benefitted
    party?

- In court, there will be a party hoping to enforce the agreement
  (likely the **benefited party**) and a party seeking to get the
  agreement abolished (the **burdened party**)

(2) Is it a real covenant or equitable servitude? → **check by looking
    at remedy sought**

- **Money damages 🡪 real covenant**

  - **Rules are stricter than for equitable servitude**

- **Injunction 🡪 equitable servitude**

(3) Is there a burden running, a benefit running, or both?

    (a) If both, do burden analysis first

    (b) Is horizontal privity, vertical privity, or both required?

        (i) *Note - no such thing as diagonal privity*

![Diagram Description automatically generated with medium
confidence](media/image2.png){width="5.322222222222222in"
height="3.088888888888889in"}

**TWIN\[ES\]**

**(1) Writing:** agreement between A1 + B1 (original parties who created
covenant) must be in writing

- In a deed or otherwise

- Note covenant itself doesn't need to be in writing, just privity

**(2) Intent:** A1 + B1 (original parties who created covenant) must
have intended for covenant to bind successors

**(3) Touch and concern:** *Neponsit HOA*

- Easy to satisfy

- Affects the party's disadvantages and burdens as owners of a
  particular parcels, rather than has just party of a community

  - Covenant has to affect benefits and burdens to you as the owner for
    [your specific parcel]{.underline}

    - Burdens + benefits your ownership - not specifically your physical
      land itself

- Example of what likely doesn't satisfy → dues for golf course in
  another country → value of golf course is increased by covenant, but
  value of lots is likely not affected in anyway

**(4) Notice**

- Can be actual or constructive notice

  - Record notice → was on the records in county, was on deed, you
    should have looked

  - Inquiry notice → could have found out if you inquired further

**Tulk v. Moxhay (1848): disadvantages \"priced in\" to the sale of
land;** creates equitable servitudes specifically to get around absence
of horizontal privity

- **Facts**: D purchases land w/ provision he would keep private garden
  a garden, but builds on it anyways

- **Holding:** covenant is enforceable, despite lack of horizontal
  privity, bc person acquired the property **with notice**

- **Reasoning:** Court concerned no one will want to sell land to anyone
  else out of fear the person will do something w/ the land that makes
  the land YOU retained less valuable

  - If you can't prevent someone doing something obnoxious on it, you
    might not be willing to sell the property → contrary to property law
    which wants transfer of property bc it encourages efficient use of
    land

- **Unjust enrichment** concern as well - cost of complying w/ burden
  was priced into D's purchase price

  - If someone doesn't have to have burden, D got a windfall

> → *Lee: reasoning doesn't make sense bc if burden wasn't one that
> could be enforced due to no horizontal privity, WAS it even priced
> into agreement?*

- In creating equitable servitudes, courts basically ditched horizontal
  privity requirements

##  Covenants: real covenants

height="3.6305293088363952in"}

**BURDEN \[WITHN\], BENEFIT \[WITV\]**

**1) Writing:** agreement between A1 + B1 (original parties who created
covenant) must be in writing

**2) Intent:** A1 + B1 (original parties who created covenant) must have
intended for covenant to bind successors

**3) Touch and concern:** *Neponsit HOA*

  another country → value of golf course is increased by covenant, but
  value of lots is likely not affected in anyway

**4) Horizontal Privity**

- **nexus btw the two parties must be one of succession of estate**
  (need not be complete succession)

  - Selling estate (grantor/grantee) OR renting estate (leasee/leasor)

  - Merely being neighbors **insufficient** for covenant to run with
    land (can still enter into covenant tho)

**5) Vertical Privity**

- Easier to establish cf. horizontal

- **Any non-hostile nexus between the parties will generally satisfy**
  (i.e. any relationship so long as A1 didn't acquire A2 by AP)

- **Complete succession of estate - has to be a grantor/grantee sale**

  - A2 leasing from A1 = incomplete succession, renting is no bueno

**Notice**

- Can be actual or constructive notice\*

  - *\*if in traditional jurisdiction that doesn't require actual notice
    for the burden of a real covenant\**

  - [Record notice]{.underline} → was on the records in county, was on
    deed, you should have looked

  - [Inquiry notice]{.underline} → could have found out if you inquired
    further

    - *Sanborn v. McLean* - negative covenant (burden) ran with the land
      bc D had inquiry notice of covenant; D should have noticed
      residential building uniformity in D's subdivision and inquired
      further to see if there was a negative covenant

 

**Neponsit Property Owners' Association, Inc. v. Emigrant Industrial
Savings Bank** → covenant to pay HOA fee "touched + concerned" land bc
it provided community benefits to owner

- Key case in liberalizing the \"touch and concern\" requirement

<!-- -->

- **Facts:** did covenant to pay HOA fee touch and concern the land?

- **Holding:** yes, because covenant affected D's advantages as an owner
  of the parcel

- **Reasoning:** Covenant was done for things that were done in
  connection with the land but **not actually on the land itself**

  - HOA dues were for parks / paths / roads near parcel → benefits you
    get to enjoy by virtue of owning land

- Court endorses Prof. Bigelow's famous definition of touch + concern

  - Covenant must **affect the party's advantages + burdens as owners of
    a particular parcel,** rather than just as a part of a community

- Does the covenant make owning this parcel less valuable in one way,
  but also either make owning the parcel more valuable in another way,
  OR make owning a related parcel more valuable?

- This holding is broader than stuff that just physically affects dity
  and building of property

- **Broadened definition of touch + concern - easy to satisfy**

**Remember, if neither parties in question are original parties to
agreement, you need to check if both the burden AND the benefit run**

## Covenants: running with the land 

**Eagle Enterprises, Inc. v. Gross: [def "touch and concern": covenants
must substantially alter the rights which would otherwise flow from
ownership of the land]{.mark};** general rule against affirmative
covenants that run for perpetuity

- **Facts**: conveyance included a covenant that required Orchard Hill
  to provide water to Baum in exchange for money from May through
  October (It also obligated Baum to buy the water at that price) 🡪 The
  deed had an express provision stating that it would run with the land
  🡪 Baum didn\'t want to pay for the water, while Eagle Enterprises
  wanted to force him to pay for it

- **Reasoning**: The crux of the case is whether the covenant touches
  the land

- The court stated that covenants must substantially alter the rights
  which would otherwise flow from the ownership of land

- Here, there is no interest in land benefited by being required to pay
  money for the land

<!-- -->

- The court distinguishes Neponsit, saying that the owners there
  received an easement to utilize public areas

  - Meanwhile, the covenant here represents a personal contract
    regarding the water, and thus it does not \"touch and concern the
    land\"

- Policy reasons:

  - The law disfavors affirmative covenants out of fear that this type
    of obligation imposes an unfair burden/restriction in perpetuity 🡪
    amounts to a general rule against affirmative covenants that run for
    perpetuity

  - Distinguishable from Neponsit because the covenant in Neponsit had
    an expiration date

## Covenants: notice

## 

**Sanborn v. McLean (1925):** D had inquiry notice bc they should have
recognized uniformity of other residential-use lots + inquired to see if
covenant existed

- The Court referred to the covenant as a **reciprocal negative easement
  (negative covenant)**

<!-- -->

- **Facts:** D wants to build gas station on their lot. Lot had covenant
  that limited lot to residential use, but the covenant wasn't on all
  deeds in subdivision erroneously, including D's.

- **Holding:** Covenant is binding because defendant had constructive
  inquiry notice of covenant

- **Reasoning:** Entire subdivision was residential → D should have
  realized uniformity

- Subdivision plan as residential was repeatedly declared in deeds for
  subsequent sales of lots → covenant was repeated by others, it was
  known

- Purchasers of lots that didn't even have restriction on deed either
  complied with it

- D is only party to depart from plan in 30 years

- [Counterargument]{.underline}→ what if uniformity was accidental? How
  much inquiry did they need to do? How many deeds had this mistake? How
  many do you need to check before you've done enough?

  - Is this fair to hold purchasers accountable to covenant when they
    aren't the one that made a mistake?

##  Covenants: termination

**TERMINATION OF COVENANTS**

**(1) Negotiation of the release**

**(2) Abandonment**

**(3) Changed circumstances**

- **Courts are more willing to terminate them on this basis when it
  pertains to covenants**

 

**Bolotin v. Rindge (1964[): changed circumstances may deem covenant
unenforceable if the purpose of the restrictions have been rendered
obsolete, such that (1) enforcement would be inequitable + oppressive,
(2) harass burdened parties, and (3) not benefit adjoining
owner/neighbor]{.mark}** (Court -- important to distinguish between
effect on market value (trial courts finding) and comfort and enjoyment
of neighbors, which is what matters

**Facts:** P had lot with covenant to limit lots in subdivision to
single family residences. 🡪 P wanted to build commercial building on his
lot before covenant expired and argued the circumstances had changed,
best use of lot was commercial, lot was unsuitable for single family
residences, and commercial build would have no adverse effect on market
value or amenities of neighbors (only bring commercial use 100 feet
closer than already exists). D argued traffic would negatively impact
home value in subdivision.

- Built in expiration clause: The covenant expired in 1970 by its own
  terms

- **Reasoning**:

- **[[Requirements for change of circumstances to deem covenant
  unenforceable]{.underline}]{.mark}**

  - [(1) changed circumstances have rendered the restrictions' purposes
    obsolete, OR]{.mark}

  - [(2)]{.mark} **enforcement of the restrictions would be (a)
    inequitable and oppressive, (b)**

  <!-- -->

  - **harass the land owner, and © would not benefit the adjoining
    owner/neighbor**

<!-- -->

- **Court said that the correct test is whether enforcement of the
  covenant would not benefit the neighbors**

  - **Market value could increase even if it was becoming more
    uninhabitable**

<!-- -->

- Here, TC reversed and remanded the trial, such that TC could assess
  whether neighbors would suffer a non-market value loss if the covenant
  were not enforced

**[Why Is Changed Circumstances Doctrine Useful?]{.underline}**

Developer might have made wrong predictions about what future would look
like

- D might have thought it should have been residential property, but
  maybe that was just wrong

- Or, there are many parties to the covenant, so negotiating termination
  would be impossible, last will try + hold out

**COVENANTS CAN BE ABANDONED**

- Requires affirmative action

 

**Peckham v. Milroy (2001)** [abandonment of covenant permissible when
covenant is habitually + substantially violated]{.mark}

- **Facts:** D ran daycare against covenant banning commercial use in
  subdivision. D argued covenant was abandoned because other residents
  had commercial businesses in subdivision

- **Holding:** Abandonment allowed when covenant **habitually and
  substantially violate**

- [Requirement to for violations of covenant to constitute abandonment
  of covenant]{.underline}

  - **#1 -** Violations have eroded the general plan

  - **#2 -** Violations must have been habitual and substantial

<!-- -->

- There were violations, but a small amount compared to total lot
  (99.75%)

  - **#3 -** Violations make enforcement inequitable

**[Criticism of termination by abandonment doctrine]{.underline}**

Even if violations are habitual + substantial, is it fair to then say
abandonment has occurred and no one is bound by this?

- If no one was wearing a mask, would we say bc of that, no one should?

- Shouldn't poor people who are obeying + getting screwed over by the
  jerks that aren't listening be considered?

On the other hand, if we DON'T allow abandonment, are we giving too much
power to minority to hold out with society and prevent efficient +
beneficial use of land

#  NUISANCE

## 

- Limited by principle sic utere - use what's yours, do whatever you
  want, SO LONG as to not harm others others

- But this principle doesn't prohibit ALL injuries to others

  - Prohibiting all injuries to others would be unenforceable, and some
    benefits come inherently w/ injuries

    - Ex: rule you can't inadvertently jostle you on subway

      - You can be protected... but not have the subway

- Other people are compensated by all the advantages of civilized
  society

  - Want the benefit of the city, you have to deal with the smoke,
    odors, noise

<!-- -->

- [Landowners must make **reasonable use** so as to not occasion any
  **unnecessary damage or annoyance to his neighbor**]{.mark}

[What is reasonable depends on **circumstances**]{.underline}

- **Locality rule** → use of property in one locality, under some
  circumstances may be lawful and reasonable, but inappropriate in
  another neighborhood

  - Is the use **appropriate to the neighborhood** or not?

  - "nuisance may merely be a right thing in a wrong place"

**Rule:** To constitute a nuisance, the use must be such as to produce a
**tangible and appreciable injury** to neighboring property, [or an
injury that renders enjoyment of the property e**specially uncomfortable
or inconvenient**]{.mark}

- **Specially = diff than is ordinary in neighborhood, related to
  locality rule**

  - Eg on the train, someone punches you

- **Injury has to be significant / substantial**

**[Defenses to nuisance]{.underline}**

["Coming to the nuisance" defense]{.underline} *in some jurisdictions +
handled diff juri to juri*

- If plaintiff showed up on scene **after** objectionable activity had
  already started, [[he came to the nuisance]{.underline}]{.mark}

- Whichever conflicting use comes later, loses - earlier use has
  priority

  - If factory comes after house, bad news for factory

- Court here (and many other jurisdictions) rejects this theory → would
  allow factory to control, essentially, what happens on other people's
  property

- \...But same thing is true other way, house is also controlling what
  the factory can do

  - Aren't both people causing a nuisance, in some way?

  - Controversial defense

  - Another issue is this can encourage wasteful races to be "first" to
    use it in your obnoxious way

  - → because of the above, **courts are reluctant to recognize this
    defense**

  - [When unclear who showed up first, court balances factors like who
    got there first, good faith, spite, public interest/benefit to
    public, promissory estoppel/detrimental reliance, etc.]{.mark}

[Estoppel/acquiescence]{.underline}

- Should have said something before you invested, now you can't complain

  - Don't apply here because P invested before he knew D was burning
    bricks, so D's use wasn't priced into P's purchase

[Prescriptive easement]{.underline}

- PEs can allow someone to commit a nuisance

  - Here, D did not have a PE - one requirement of PE is continuity and
    here, there was not 20 yrs of continuous use (some years he didn't
    burn bricks)

**[Remedies for nuisance]{.underline}**

- **Injunctive relief applies to:**

  - **Avoid interminable litigation** or **multiplicity of suits**

    - e.g. gas everywhere would have been recurring, want to avoid other
      people bringing same claim

  - **Or avoid irreparable injury** (injury not remedied by \$ damages)

- If either situation above applies, you still must **balance the
  hardships/equities**

  - [Injunctions can still be denied on the basis of **balance of
    hardships**]{.mark}

  - [I[f the injunction would be excessively burdensome on the
    defendant, in light of a relatively small benefit to the plaintiff,
    might **not get injunction**]{.underline}]{.mark}

  - Must look at potential harm to society if injunction is not granted

    - Look at harm to society if D were to get an injunction/P were not
      to get an injunction

**[Anticipated nuisances do not have a COA because there isn't actual
interference yet]{.underline}**

>  

**Campbell v. Seaman (1876): [nuisance 🡪 must be appreciable or
substantial injury to neighboring land, or make enjoyment especially
uncomfortable or inconvenient;]{.mark} Locality rule**; Injunctive
Relief available to prevent **1) interminable litigation and
multiplicity of suits or 2) irreparable injury 🡨 key test is a balancing
of the hardships**

- Dicta: Prescriptive easement: continuity not interrupted if there are
  some days when wind doesn't blow sulfuric gas onto land

- **Facts:** P buys property + builds house on it when D is not burning
  bricks in adjacent property; D resumes burning bricks, which causes
  toxic gas to ruin P's extensive landscaping

  - The gas was not there continuously - only present intermittently (in
    last 2 days of the burning) + goes over P's land only when D burned
    bricks

<!-- -->

- **Holding:** D is liable for nuisance bc gas goes from D onto P's
  property frequently enough "that some injury is to be expected."

  - P has right to enjoy his land + landscaping, **injunction** is an
    appropriate remedy to preserve P's interests moving forward (P can
    replant trees!)

  - D didn't have any defenses; P cannot be estopped bc P didn't buy or
    build knowing D would burn bricks, and no PE bc no continuous use

<!-- -->

- **Reasoning:**

  - **Prima Facie Case of Nuisance** -- Reasonability dep on
    circumstances/**Locality rule** Court says here that the
    brick-laying is a nuisance because the injury was substantial enough

  - **Defenses**:

    - **Coming to the nuisance** 🡪Court here rejects it, bc **property
      owners should not be allowed to control their neighbor\'s uses**

      - **[Pricing-in theory:]{.underline}** if you buy some land right
        next to a polluted factory, you\'ll get a discounted price

    - **Nuisance situations are situations of reciprocal causation**

    - **No Easement by estoppel**: Campbell didn\'t acquiesce to the
      brick burning or induce large expenses in reliance of a promise
      with Seaman

    - **Prescriptive Easement:** continuity not interrupted if there are
      some days when wind doesn't blow sulfuric gas onto land 🡪 but
      court Court says no, because it lacks 20 years of continuous use

  <!-- -->

  - **Injunctive Relief?**

    - Yes, to prevent **1) interminable litigation and multiplicity of
      suits or 2) irreparable injury** 🡪 both are here

    - Basic standard for issuing injunctions is a balancing of the
      hardships

>  

## Scope of right of non-interference

 

**Fontainebleau Hotel Corp. v. Forty-Five Twenty-Five, Inc. 🡪 [negative
easements only available for lawful rights]{.mark}; [spite structures
permissible as long as they are useful]{.mark}**

- *Sic utere* principle → use your property to the extent that your use
  doesn't harm **neighbors lawful rights**

- Here, D could not obtain negative easement to stop P from building
  structure blocking D's sunbathing area

  - Impeded light falling on sunbathing area → NOT within 4 things you
    can get a negative easement to prevent

- Structures built **partially out of spite** → okay so long as
  structure is useful

- Structures built **only due to spite with no benefit to builder other
  than enjoyment of neighbor's suffering** → NOT allowed

  - Hard to prove bc must prove something has NO use whatsoever

  - Pragmatic bc it focuses on utility, not motives

 

**Spite Fences**

- Infrequently applied because almost every fence or wall has use
  outside of its spite value

- Court says that it\'s true in this case

- Why has the law evolved to allow people to get away with it?

  - If you didn\'t do that, you\'d have to have inquiries into what
    people\'s intent was

>  

##  Distinguishing Trespass

**Adams v. Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company:** [dust + vibrations that
interfere with owner's use + enjoyment of land = nuisance, not trespass
bc dust/vibrations not **significant, physical intrusion**]{.mark}

How to determine **[if a particular conflict is a trespass or a
nuisance]{.mark}**: **(1) D's act on-land or elsewhere, (2) direct or
indirect, (3) tangible or intangible, (4) lose possession or mere
enjoyment?**

- **Facts**: D operated iron mine and expanded mine 3x (1 time of which
  may have been after P had moved there). P lived in nearby town + sued
  for BOTH trespass + nuisance

  - Argued mine generated dust, noise, vibrations which resulted in P
    clean the house all the time, replace cracks, windows, plumbing
    breaks and leaks, psychological harms in form of nervousness and
    sleeplessness, and diminished home value, so much that they couldn't
    sell it

- **Reasoning/Holding: No trespass** bc noise + vibrations are not
  tangible, and dust is not a significant enough physical intrusion

[Requirements for trespass]{.underline}

- Invasion of your property that is both

  - Done by **physical, tangible object**

  - Invasion is **direct** (ct claims to liberalize formality of
    directness rule)

    - No intervening force caused thing to go onto property (like wind)

    - "Occurs by some means that **D had knowledge to substantial
      certainty**, or should have known, was going to cause a physical
      invasion"

- Recall per *Jacque v. Stenberg Homes*, you get nominal damages for
  trespass, even w/o any damage at all

[Requirements for nuisance]{.underline} (one approach, not same one as
*Campbell* or *Jacque*, its a different approach)

- Have to pass **balancing test based on social value of the activity**

  - How beneficial is activity?

  - How harmful is activity?

  - Do we care about these benefits + harms?

  - Is society better off with harm + benefit, and no harm but no
    benefit?

- To get damages, you have to prove there's **actual + substantial
  injury**

**4 standard tests to tell diff between nuisance and trespass**

*some jurisdictions use, one, combination of some, all of them*

\(1\) Was defendants act on plaintiff\'s land or was defendant's act
elsewhere?

- Trespass v. nuisance

\(2\) Was harm of D's activity direct or indirect?

- Trespass v. nuisance

\(3\) Was invasion by tangible matter or intangible?

- Trespass v. nuisance

- Are invading items **individually visible to naked eye?**

\(4\) Did P lose possession, or merely enjoyment of property?

- Trespass v. nuisance 

**[Calabresi & Melamed: "Cathedral Paper"]{.underline}**

- Court must decide not only which side to favor, but whom to entitle,
  which entitlements are protected, whether an individual is allowed to
  sell or trade the entitlement, the kind of protection to grant

- Three types of entitlements:

  - [Property]{.underline}

    - An entitlement is protected by a property rule to the extent that
      someone who wishes to remove the entitlement from its holder must
      buy it from him in a voluntary transaction in which the value is
      agreed upon by the seller

    - Least amount of state intervention

- [Liability]{.underline}

  - Whenever someone may destroy the initial entitlement if he is
    willing to pay an objectively determined value for it

  - The value may be what it is thought the original holder of the
    entitlement would have sold it for

  - Additional stage of state intervention -- not only are entitlements
    protected, but their transfer or destruction is allowed on the basis
    of a value determined by [some organ of the state rather than the
    parties themselves]{.underline}

- [Inalienable]{.underline}

  - Transfer is not permitted between a willing buyer and a willing
    seller

  - The state not only determined who is entitled and to determine
    compensation is the entitlement is taken away or destroyed, but also
    to forbid its sale under certain or all circumstances

  - Limits or regulates the grant of the entitlement itself

  - Most entitlements to most goods are mixed

- How is price determined?

  - By the person who holds the entitlement (property)

    - Better when transaction costs are low

  - Someone else (liability) -- court sets price to defendant to
    compensate plaintiff

    - May be better when transaction costs are high

- Most scholarship that follows Calabresi have assumed that property
  rule protection means mandatory relief (an injunction or no liability)
  and liability rule means payment of monetary compensation, but the
  textbook authors see this as an oversimplification.

- Property rule -- cannot be taken without holder's consent

- Liability rule -- can be taken by what amounts to a forced sale

- Common starting point in literature discussing this is that **courts
  have a choice** regarding if property or liability and the assignment
  of the entitlement to the plaintiff or defendant

  - **[Property Rule:]{.underline}** the price of the entitlement is
    determined by the parties and the entitlement is given voluntarily →
    injunction

    - P gets the entitlement -- *Campbell v. Seaman*

    - D gets the entitlement -- *Hinman v. Pacific Air*

  - **[Liability Rule:]{.underline}** the price of the entitlement is
    determined and given by someone else (usually a court) money damages
    (usually according to fair market value)

    - P gets the entitlement and liability rule protection, however is
      required to accept money damages in exchange for dealing with
      nuisance - *Boomer v. Atlantic Cement*

    - D gets the entitlement -- *Spur v. Webb*

- When there are many plaintiffs as part of one party -- *Boomer v.
  Atlantic Cement*

  - Too costly to negotiate with each P (assembly problem)

  - Each P has an inventive to hold out and ask the other party for
    money (hold out problem)

→ the most economical solution is to (1) hold for P and (2) protect
entitlement with liability rule (solves both the assembly problem and
hold out problem)

- **Inalienable Entitlement:** transfer isn't allowed at all

**[Three factors as to assigning initial entitlement:]{.underline}**

- Economic efficiency

- Distributional preferences

- Other justice considerations

  - If **transaction costs are high**, there may be circumstances in
    which shifting to liability is preferred on efficiency grounds

- Another argument here is that courts may have more limited information
  than the parties about the benefits and costs of allocating
  entitlements

# ZONING 

 

**ZONING AND OTHER LAND-USE REGULATION**

- Similar to covenants, but typically broader scale and **done by the
  government**

  - Zoning is done by law (ordinances)

**[Two ways to potentially avoid zoning regulations]{.underline}**

- Seek a special exception → written within ordinance itself

- Request for variance

  - Variance = exception due to hardship, given on case by case basis

**Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.: established the
constitutionality of use of zoning ordinances bc its justified for
public welfare**

- **Struck down a facial challenge, but \"as applied\" challenges may
  still be viable**

<!-- -->

- **\*\*\*Euclidean zoning - use zoning**

  - Complicated one - three height zones with four area zones, which
    limited the area, but the focus of the legal issue is on the use
    zones

<!-- -->

- **Facts:** Village had 6 difference use zones; each zone was assigned
  certain activities and organized together ("good" zones, single family
  homes, parks + less favorable zones, cemeteries) → **use zoning**

- **[Cumulative zoning:]{.underline}** area zoned for particular use,
  permissible to engage in that use, in addition to any use that is less
  intensive (i.e., more pleasant)

  - You can build duplex in U2-U6, aka anywhere that allows more
    intensive use

- **Holding:** A legislative zoning classification will survive
  constitutional scrutiny as long as the classification is "fairly
  debatable."

  - Will be constitutional unless it is "clearly arbitrary +
    unreasonable, having no substantial relation of public health,
    safety, morals, general welfare, etc."

  - Here, D found justification of ordinance in some aspect of D's
    police power → **public welfare**

    - Excluding industry, apartments in single-family home are makes
      sense, preserve neighborhood, don't want "parasitic" apartments +
      shops in residential neighborhood

**[Terminology]{.underline}**

- **Non-conforming use:** uses that **pre-existed prior to zoning**, but
  do not conform after zoning, are grandfathered in + allowed to remain

  - Even if lot existed prior to zoning, you cannot build something on
    it after zoning and call it a non-conforming use → building itself
    had to exist + be in use prior to zoning

  - Also cannot swap uses if you are a non-confirming use

    - Can't swap over to being a school, for ex

- **Amortization:** *some*, not all, jurisdictions, use amortization to
  phase out non-conforming use after a specified period of time

  - You can keep doing what you're doing, but, you have to stop doing
    it + comply with zoning ordinance in X \# number of years

**[Exclusionary Zoning]{.underline}**

- Earliest zoning targeted characteristics of **users** rather than
  **uses**

  - Enforced economic + residential segregation

- This is now unconstitutional

**Policy Arguments in Favor of Zoning**

- **Limits negative externalities**

  - Solely money damages for nuisance law

  - Homeowners at enormous risk of variables that enter that affects
    market value

- **Collective action problems: got to get everyone to agree for it to
  work**

- **More trust in the government than in private individuals**

- **Promotes certainty**

 

**Disadvantages of Zoning**

- **Potential for rent-seeking:** Behavior by entities that spend
  resources to lobby the government to get special economic
  advantages/rents for themselves

- **Still constitutional to have regulations that have a discriminatory
  impact**

  - Zoning in Euclid had the effect of keeping out lower economic
    classes from certain areas because they wouldn\'t be able to afford
    the kinds of residences permitted in particular zones

  - Covenant in Sandborn v. McLean: minimum cost

  - Some zoning regulations today require minimum lot sizes

# DIVIDING OWNERSHIP

##  Future Interests

** **

**[Estate:]{.underline}** property rights defined in terms of their
duration through time

- Temporal measure of a property right

**Present Possessory Interest**

- Interests that give a possessory right in the present

- **(1) Fee Simple Absolute**

  - **Largest** package of property rights you can have - everything
    else is less

  - If transferring property + don't specify otherwise, it is
    **presumed** you are transferring a fee simple absolute

  - **Indefinite**, runs to infinity

- Granted by language such as "I grant Black Acre **to Jones."**

  - As long as you are alive, you may have heirs apparent (not just
    "heirs" until you're dead)

    - Heirs "apparent" bc you might change mind about who's your heir

      - Eg. "to Jones and his heirs" just means to Jones bc Jones is
        alive + thus has no heirs

  - Fees simple absolute → plural version

- **(2) Life Estate**

  - Interest that gives you a right to possess the property, but right
    terminates automatically upon death of named person

    - Estate exists as long as certain person is alive

    - Can be transferred → alienable by gift or by sale

  - **However, if A sells their life estate to B, a life estate pour
    autre vie is created**

    - Estate will be measured by original holder's life

>  

**[Complete succession of estate for vertical privity in
covenants]{.underline}**

- If A1 owns Black Acre in FSA, and transfers LE to A2, that is NOT
  complete succession of estate, bc life estate doesn't last as long as
  the fee simple absolute (which is... FOREVER!)

  - It's only partial succession of estate

**DEFEASIBLE FEES**

- Allow ownership to change if some specified event occurs

  - But whether event will actually occur or not is uncertain → might
    happen, might not

  - If it does happen, estate is terminated / if it doesn't happen,
    estate is not terminated

- This is in contrast to a life estate, which inevitably always ends,
  they will always terminate

- Defeasible fees → might not terminate, you don't know

- Many states statutes require defeasible fees be **limited in their
  duration**, that it be 30 yrs or so, after that, they're just locked
  in

>  

- **(1) Fee Simple Determinable \[FSD\]**

  - Ends **automatically** if a named event occurs

  - Often the event is the ending of some condition

  - Created using **[durational languag]{.underline}**e -- as long as,
    while, until

  - Future interest: possibility of reverter

    - Fee simple determinable - creates an implicit possibility of
      reverter

>  

- **(2) Fee Simple subject to a Condition Subsequent \[FSSCS\]**

  - Continues indefinitely but if the named event occurs, **IT DOES NOT
    AUTOMATICALLY END** 🡪 **ORIGINAL** **GRANTOR can choose whether or
    not to terminate** the possessory right

  - Created using **[conditional language]{.underline}** (\"but if,\"
    \"on condition that\")

  - Future Interest: Right of entry/power of termination

>  

- **(3) Fee Simple subject to Executory Limitation**

  - If the triggering of event occurs, the possessory interest goes to
    **THIRD PARTY**

  - Can be created by either durational or conditional language

    - Easy to figure out if this is executory limitation, because the
      interest goes to a third party

  - Appears to works automatically → not a thing where 3rd party has a
    choice to take it or not

  - \"To A, but if XYZ, then to B\"

 

**Corresponding Future Interests**

**[Reversionary (I.e., in grantor)]{.underline}**

- **STEPS TO FIGURING OUT FUTURE INTEREST**

  - \(1\) Figure out which PRESENT POSSESSORY INTEREST has been created

  - \(2\) See what future interest corresponds to that Present
    Possessory Interest

- Note that future interests may convert to present possessory interests
  over time

- Can be divided into two different categories

  - Reversionary: goes back to the original grantor

  - In other People: someone other than the original grantor

- \"to A for life, to B for life, then to C\"

  - Gives A and B life estates, and C a remainder in fee simple absolute

  - Someone with a remainder = **remainderman**

- Interests in the original grantor, the person who created this whole
  thing in the first place

- NEVER situation where NO ONE has possessory interest → someone can
  always take

  - Even if there's a grant that doesn't explicitly who can take at any
    given time and looks like a gap, there's someone implicitly that can
    take

<!-- -->

- No revisionary for fee simple absolute (lasts until end of time)

<!-- -->

- Life estate → Reversion

  - If grant to A for life, when A dies, life estate goes back to
    original grantor

    - OG then has a reversion

<!-- -->

- Fee simple determinable -- possibility of reverter

  - Follows every single FSD, and is unique to FSD

  - Returns possession to the grantor w/ possibility of reverter

    - FSD in offeree and possibility of reverter, implicity, in offeror

  - Possibility of reverter is **automatic** - it happens if triggering
    event occurs

    - Implicit if fee simple determinable doesn't say what happens
      exactly if event occurs

      - "I will do X as long as there's a train station on 14th St."

      - Durational language creates fee simple determinable

- AP clock can start to run if the holder of fee simple determinable,
  who should vacate once triggering event occurs, but doesn't

- Fee simple subject to a condition subsequent → right of entry (power
  of termination)

  - Goes back to original grantor → right of entry, or power of
    termination

    - Gives OG the **right, but not the obligation** to retake

      - [Note latches may bar exercising this right if OG waits too
        long!]{.mark}

      - If you're going to exercise your right of entry, then you need
        to do so within a reasonable time after getting the right

    - OG can choose to let former possessor stay there

- Fee simple subject to executory limitation → no reversionary interest
  bc whole point of this is that the right goes to the other person

**[In Other People]{.underline}**

- **Fee simple absolute →** none bc lasts for lifetime

- **Life estate →** future interest, if there is one, is a remainder

  - Eg. grant to A for life, then to B → B is not OG, doesn't have
    reversion, but has a **remainder and is a remainderman**

  - Remainders can be any form of these present possessory interests

    - Eg. since no qualification on B's remainder interest, it's just a
      remainder in FSA

    - Eg. if to A for life, then to B for life → B has remainder in LE
      to B

- **Fee simple determinable** → no right in other people, if triggering
  event occurs, goes back to OG through right of entry/power of
  termination

- **Fee simple subject to a condition subsequent** → no right in other
  people, if triggering event occurs, goes back to OG

- **Fee simple subject to executory limitation** → executory interest

  - Future interest correspondent goes to other people if the triggering
    event occurs

>  

**Rule of Perpetuities**

- It is a mechanism for reducing uncertainty about property ownership

- Prohibits creation of future interests that vests too far into the
  future

- Vests under different circumstances 🡪 uncertainty

- Defeats creation of certain interests

##  WASTE

- Divide interests across time 🡪 possibility of durational conflicts btw
  owners today vs. tomorrow

> **[Problem of divergence of interests]{.underline}**

- Eg. chopping down trees that take a long time to grow!

<!-- -->

- Law tries to mitigate the divergence of interests with the **doctrine
  of waste**

  - [This is the default rule, basic rule law applies unless relevant
    rights holders agree to do something else]{.mark}

    - [E.g. if the right holders all agreed to remove the trees]{.mark}

**[(1) Affirmative waste]{.underline}**

- Person w/ present possessory interest is doing something **bad**

  - Not normal use, rather, **use that causes excess damage**

  - Use that causes normal wear and tear is NOT affirmative waste

    - Eg. Chopping down ornamental trees; this isn't just normal wear
      and tear, this is not normal, bad

**[(2) Permissive]{.underline}**

- Person w/ present possessory interest DOESN'T act

- **Unreasonable failure to act** which causes **excess damage**

  - Eg. roof starts leaking but person doesn't fix roof - they didn't do
    anything when they should have acted to prevent excess damage in the
    form of water damage

**[(3) Ameliorative]{.underline}**

- Significant change in the property

- Although its a change, unlike the other 2 changes in affirmative in
  permissive waste, this change **increases the value of the property**,
  changes the property in a way that makes the property "better"

  - Typically "better" = increases market valuable

- Today, this waste *can be allowed*, if there are **changed
  circumstances**

  - You can do ameliorative waste sometimes, not always

>  

**Brokaw v. Fairchild (1929):** [ameliorative waste, even though it
makes property value better, can still be form of waste / **life tenant
has right to use estate, but NOT right to act like owner** / knocking
building down is acting like owner]{.mark}

**Facts:** P, a remainderman, had inherited a mansion from his father
and wanted to knock the mansion down and build apartments, claiming he
couldn't rent the mansion for enough to cover the tax bill. The other
remaindermen who also inherited mansions located nearby objected and
argue knocking the mansion down is waste.

[**Holding:** If you have a life estate, you do not own the property,
cannot act like an owner, and must pass the property to remainderman in
similar condition.]{.mark} Thus, P cannot knock the mansion down because
to do so is wasteful.

- Demolishing property = act of ownership

- The property must pass to the remainderman "as nearly as practicable,
  unimpaired in its nature, character, or improvements," otherwise, it's
  waste

<!-- -->

- If you have a life estate, you can just use the estate, but **you
  can't impair what it is that is handed down on to the remainderman**

- Doesn't matter if the remaindermen would or would not be financially
  better off

  - **Not all values can be reduced to monetary values**

    - Even if everyone would be better off financially, doesn't mean
      they'd be better off all things considered

    - They may have lost irreparable sentimental value

- Same idea as in *Bolotin v. Rindge* - just looking at market value of
  property is not enough, must consider other aspects of property
  outside of market value that are important to people

## Co-tenancies

## 

**CONCURRENT OWNERSHIP**

- Multiple owners at the same time

- i.e.: \"O grants Blackacre to A for life, then to B and C\"

  - A has a life estate in Blackacre, and B and C own Blackacre in fee
    simple absolute in remainder.

**Common-law co-tenancies:**

1.  **Tenancy in Common:** **ea tenant\'s interest is [undivided but
    separate]{.underline}**

    - [[Each has the right to possess the whole]{.underline}]{.mark}

      - Eg if Jack + Jill own a house as tenants in common, Jack cannot
        exclude Jill from the living room, Jack cannot exclude Jill from
        the kitchen, etc.

    - \...But, these interests are **separate** 🡪 **independently
      alienable**

    - Share sizes do NOT need to be equal

      i.  Co-tenants may have unequal rights to profits or to rents from
          the property

      ii. Co-tenants may have unequal responsibilities/obligations

    - [Co-tenants do not have any property rights against each
      other]{.mark}

    - No co-tenant can demand rent from another co-tenant

2.  **Joint Tenancy:**

- Similar as TIC w/ 3 major differences

> **[#1 Joint tenancy has a right of survivorship]{.underline}**

- When one joint tenant dies, his interest vanishes, and any other joint
  tenant's interest increases proportionately

  1.  Survivors have a right to the deceased tenants share

  2.  Rationale → if one interest vanishes, you don't want gap in
      interest, someone has to always have an interest

- This is true REGARDLESS of wills

  - Another hypo - [if Blackacre is owned by 3 tenants, A, B, C who all
    have equal shares, and A dies, B and C would each own a half of
    Blackacre]{.mark} - this is true **regardless** of what A's will
    said

- Implication → don't want to enter into joint tenancy unless you trust
  the joint tenants

> **[#2 Joint tenancy requires satisfying the "four
> unities"]{.underline}**

- [*(1) Unity of **possession*** - each joint tenant must have an
  **EQUAL right** to possess the whole (same as tenancy in
  common)]{.mark}

- *(2) Unity of **time*** - each joint tenants interest must have been
  established at the same time

- *(3) Unity of **title** -* each tenant got their title (ownership
  share) via the same instrument

  - AP can be the same instrument (its possible, doesn't just need to be
    via deed)

- *(4) Unity of **interest*** - they must all have a fee simple, or a
  life estate, or a lease

  - The interest has to be **the same type for all joint tenants**

- Some states have relaxed time + title requirement bc it\'s easy to get
  around via a straw transaction anyways

> **[#3 Joint tenants share sizes must be the same]{.underline}**

i.  Each tenant must have the same size shares

    1.  *In minority of states, you don't need to have shares same size*

    2.  *Note if exam says something is a "properly formed joint
        tenancy" , you assume that it is and move on. Don't try and
        challenge the asusmptions/facts given in fact pattern*

[[Below 2 are for marital property only]{.underline}]{.mark}

3.  **Tenancies by the entirety**

    - *Exists in a number of states, but not all*

    - Holdover from the fact that under the common law, for many
      centuries, married women were not allowed to own property in their
      own name

    - Similar to joint tenancy - has a right of survivorship, REQ 4
      UNITIES

      - **[Fifth unity -]{.underline}** have to be married to have it

    - Marriage is a unit, property belongs to the unit → **key
      difference is neither spouse can unilaterally transfer property
      that's held by the tenancy by the entirety or by incumbent**
      (can't take mortgage out against it)

      - They can transfer property **ONLY IF** the other spouse agrees

      - Both spouse must agree to any transfer the interest or incumbent

    - Can't get out of a tenancy by the entirely unilaterally

      - Have to get other spouse to agree OR get divorced → only way to
        get out of tenancy by the entirety

4.  **Common Property**

    - Alternative to TBE → state has one or the other, but not both

    - All property acquired in a marriage automatically becomes
      community property, regardless of which spouse acquired it

      - Equal right to possess community property

      - Alienation or encumbrance of community property requires consent
        of both spouses

    <!-- -->

    - If spouses divorce, community property is divided equally 50/50,
      unless spouse can show it was separate property (which means it\'s
      not governed by community property)

[Both tenancy by the entirety + community property require permission
from other spouse to transfer property, but difference is that in
community property after divorce, all property is divided
equally]{.underline}

**[Hypo]{.underline}**

Grant gives blackacre to A and B.

- [Assuming they're not married they are either a TIC or JT]{.mark}

  - [Without further specification, it is **presumed it is a tenancy in
    common**]{.mark}

  - [Presumption is that it is a tenancy in common]{.mark}

**[Resolving Disputes Amongst Co-Owners]{.underline}**

- **Future Interest Disputes** → doctrine of waste will step in to place
  restrictions on what present owner can do (or in permissive waste,
  should be doing) to protect co-owners long term property interests

- **Concurrent Owner Disputes →** court generally won't intervene; waste
  is generally disfavored as remedy for concurrent owner disputes

  - **[Remedy is partition]{.underline}**

    - If you don't like relationship, you can get out of it

<!-- -->

- [Co-tenants in tenancy in common OR joint tenancy have an automatic
  right of partition → they can just leave and get out of it]{.mark}

[How is co-ownership otherwise regulated outside of remedy of
partition?]{.underline}

- A co-owner can make **threat of exit** → I'll leave unless you do X

- Or, have a **contract between parties** that sets out norms that
  govern proper use

 

## Partition 

**PARTITION**

- Available to any cotenant at any time

- If you want out, you can

- Two ways to achieve:

1.  **By Sale: selling the estate \--\> court auctions off the property
    and divide the proceeds between the co-tenants**

2.  **In Kind: divide the property between cotenants**

    a.  **You might also have an owelty awarded: payment from one to
        another cotenant to make the values coincide with the
        distribution of their property prior to the partition**

## 

**Delfino v. Vealencis (1980)**: partition by sale / partition in kind;
**Court says that policy is to favor partition in kind unless (1) PIK
would be impracticable and inequitable, AND (2) the partition by sale
would better serve the owners\' interests**

**Facts:** Two families owned a plot of land as tenants in common. The
Delfinos owned 69% and Vealencis owned 31%. Vealencis lived on the
land + operated trash removal business out of property as well. Delfinos
did not actually have possession of their parcel (they lived elsewhere).
Delfinos wanted the court to order **partition by sale**, but Vealencis
wanted **partition in kind.**

- [**By sale** - sold at auction + divide \$ proportionate that matches
  ownership shares]{.mark}

- [**In kind -** physically dividing property up between parties + each
  party will own their part all by themselves]{.mark}

<!-- -->

- Vealencis want partition by kind bc she wants to remain on the
  property and continue operating her business

- Delfinos want to build residential subdivision on their property
  post-partition; betting they will win at auction to buy Vealencis part
  of the plot

**Rule:** Policy is **to favor partition in kind**, unless both of
following are true:

> *Have to have both conditions!*

- [Dividing in kind would be impractical or inequitable]{.underline}

- [Selling the property would be better to serve owner's
  interests]{.underline}

**Application:** Physical partition is feasible - subdivision is
possible even with the business present

- Owners interest - Delfinos might lose market value by having the
  business next door, so yes, physical partition is not in THEIR
  interest, but **you have to consider BOTH parties interests**

  - Vealencis home + livelihood depended on being on this property for
    several yrs

- **Only one set of owners interests would be served** by physical
  partition, so the second requirement isn't satisfied

  - The second requirement is that ALL owners interests would be better
    satisfied by partition by sale

- Court orders partition by kind

  - Trial court had divided up the property in kind - gave Vealencis
    only 1 acre out of 20.5 acres, and ordered her to pay an owelty

  - **Owelty =** payment to correct an imbalance that arises from
    partitioning in kind

  - Partitioning property in kind often cannot be done in exactly the
    way the parties interests are apportioned

    - Unique physical characteristics of property - like a ridge
      unevenly dividing the property

      - Person who gets smaller portion pays \$ to the other party (an
        owelty) to ensure the market value of what everyone gets is
        50/50

- Today, most states still favor partition in mind in some shape or form

- Might be a trend for support for partition by sale, which makes sense
  bc modern property is less likely to be easily divisible

  - Against partition by sale → sentimental value to property that
    cannot be valued in dollars, social cost going to be lost in the
    sale bc no one is going to pay more for the property just bc it has
    an extra sentimental value for you

## Severance

- Converts a joint tenancy to a tenancy in common

  - NOT partition - partition converts joint tenancy or tenancy in
    common into SEPARATE ownership, fees altogether

- Severance does NOT eliminate the co-ownership relationship

  - [It converts joint tenancy to a tenancy in common]{.mark}

    - Either joint tenant can unilaterally sever a joint tenancy, in
      common law, you do this by severing one of the four units by for
      example engaging in straw transaction

**Harms v. Sprague (1984): [unilateral mortgages do not sever joint
tenancies]{.mark}**

**Facts:** Two brothers owned property in joint tenancy. John created a
mortgage interest in Simmons and left his share of the property in his
will to Sprague. John dies.

- If mortgage to Simmons severed the joint tenancy, John and William
  would own simply as "tenants in common", and tenants in common do NOT
  have a right of survivorship → thus when John died, his will WOULD be
  effective + Sprague would get the interest

[#1 Does a mortgage by one joint tenant sever the joint tenancy,
creating a tenancy in common?]{.underline}

- No. Destroying one of the 4 unities would - if John had SOLD his
  interest to Simmons, that would have severed the joint tenancy. But a
  mortgage does not involve a transfer in this way. There hasn't been a
  conveyance, so that doesn't severe the joint tenancy

  - Note it could have, if John stopped making the mortgage payments and
    redemption period expired, Simmons would be able to take the
    property

- Unilateral mortgage does not sever the joint tenancy

[#2 Does the mortgage survive the mortgager's death as a lien?
NO]{.underline}

- Does John's real property interest that was securing the mortgage
  still secure the mortgage after John dies?

- No. This was a lien on the giver, John's, interest. Once John dies,
  his interest vanishes, it is not transferred. When John died, his
  interest vanished and his interest was the interest that was securing
  the mortgage. Once John's interest is gone when he dies, there's
  nothing left securing the mortgage, so Simmons loses out as well.

  - Simmons no longer has the security for the mortgage, but Simmons
    might still be able to make a claim that he is owed the \$, might
    not be able to get it bc he lacks the security interest, but in
    practice can raise a claim

- Thus, Williams retains 100% of the property

[Simmons should have required both joint tenants sign the mortgage, so
he could have recovered.]{.underline}

[What if Williams died first?]{.underline}

- John now owns 100% of the property. The mortgage is now, as a general
  rule, still secured only by John's original interest in the property,
  not the new, 100% interest

[[Unilateral mortgages doesn't sever joint tenancy]{.underline}]{.mark}

- Courts differ as to if a unilateral *lease* severs a joint tenancy -
  depends on jurisdiction

- Courts do agree one tenant murdering another tenant does sever the
  joint tenancy

<!-- -->

- If John had *sold* his interest to SImmons, that would have severed
  the joint tenancy

##  Leases: dependent covenants 

- Leases transfer possession, so transfer the right to exclude, unlike
  licenses or easements, which are rights to use, not to possess

> **FOUR TYPES**

- **(1) Term of Years**

  i.  Lease that ends automatically on a **definite, fixed ending date**

  ii. If more than one year 🡪 SOF

  iii. Because it ends automatically, neither party needs to give notice

- **(2) Periodic Tenancies**

<!-- -->

- Automatically roll over for a specified period of time

- Tend to also end on a certain date, but automatically continues to
  renew until another party stops it

  - Either party may terminate, but typically requires advanced notice,
    with time period usually being the same as the lease period

<!-- -->

- **(3) Tenancy At Will**

<!-- -->

- Can be terminated by any party at any time for any reason

- Many JX do require advanced notice, with time period usually being the
  same as the lease period, unless its year-to-year

<!-- -->

- **(4). Tenancy At Sufferance**

  i.  Not a true lease/tenancy because the tenant doesn't have any real
      right to possess

  ii. Arises when tenant doesn't leave after a lease ends

  iii. Tenant is different from a trespasser because a trespasser never
       had permission to enter property

  iv. Landlord has right to evict, but **may not have right to
      self-help**

  v.  One key doctrinal feature: **tenancies at sufferance do not start
      the Adverse Possession clock**

>  

[Big theme in leases is allocation of risk]{.underline}

- Law sorting out how to allocate risk in situations where there are
  asymmetries of information and control between landlord + tenants

>  

**Medico-Dental Building Company of Los Angeles v. Horton and Converse
(1942)**

 

- **Facts:** P owned a medical building and leased a space out to D, a
  drugstore. The lease had a restrictive covenant that prevented P from
  leasing any other portion of the building to another business selling
  drugs. D found out another tenant, a doctor, was selling drugs to his
  own patients. D rescinds its lease and stops paying rent. P sues D for
  the unpaid rent.

- **Holding:** The restrictive covenant and covenant to pay rent are
  dependent. Thus, tenant is allowed to withhold rent while lessor is
  violating restrictive covenant.

[[Evidence covenants were dependent / intended to be linked]{.underline}
→ *look at intent of the parties*]{.mark}

- **TEST:** If one party violated one covenant - does that justify or
  excuse the other party\'s declining to comply with another covenant?

  - NO 🡪 **covenants are independent** 🡪sue for damages

  - YES 🡪 **covenants are dependent** 🡪 entitled to not comply w/
    dependent covenant

<!-- -->

- Both covenants were in a rider together

- Plain language of agreement

- Obvious the subject matter of the covenant to not have competition in
  the building was crucial to D and thus likely a material part of
  consideration that induced D to enter agreement / agree to pay rent

- Court also considers fact breach was **[substantial]{.mark} →** maybe
  court would hold covenants were independent had breach not been
  substantial

[Options for Remedies]{.underline}

- Rescind the lease (what D did)

- Stay with lease, but sue for lost profits for violation of the
  covenant

- Rescind the lease later, and sue for damages between time of breach +
  when they rescinded

[In general, major breaches tend to be treated as breaches of dependent
covenants.]{.underline}

[Minor breaches tend to be treated as independent
covenants.]{.underline}

 

## Leases: implied warranty 

**CAVEAT EMPTOR** "Let the person who is leasing beware of the risks"

- Allocates risk to the tenant

- There are no implied warranties of fitness for tenant\'s purpose

<!-- -->

- Traditionally/presumptively, one could have an explicit warranty of
  fitness, but there is no implied warranty of fitness

- QUESTION: Who\'s better situated to assess whether the property is
  fit?

  - Arguably the tenant knows better than the landlord what he needs to
    know precisely, since the landlord doesn\'t know what the tenant\'s
    business is

  - Harsh effects: tenant may pay for property that is not suitable for
    their use

- Courts have tried to mitigate the harshness

  - Residential Property: **Implied warranty of habitability**

  - General doctrines

    - Doctrines of surrender

    - Duty to mitigate

**Javins v. First National Realty Corp. (1970): created implied warranty
of habitability**

>  

**Facts:** Tenants withheld rent due to various violations of housing
code in their apartment.

**Holding:** There is an **implied warranty of habitability** as defined
by the Housing Code and it is **dependent** on the tenant's implied
covenant to pay rent.

- Moving away from old rule where tenant bears burden for all repairs,
  even major repairs

- In most jurisdictions, this warranty is statute, and it is **not
  waivable** - it is a mandatory rule

- Implied warranty of habitability is **dependent on tenant's implied
  covenant to pay rent** → if landlord breaches, tenant doesn't have to
  pay rent

  - *Potential exception →* If there is only a partial breach, tenant
    might be exempt from paying only part of the rent (get a discount)

[Rationale for making implied warranty of habitability]{.underline}

- **1) Common law default rule (old rule) no longer makes sense in the
  modern world**

  - Tenants are no longer handy, good at repairing things, incompetent
    urban dwellers, modern housing more complex so harder to repair

  - Tenant cannot internalize the full benefit for repairs that are made

  - Tenants frequently move since they are renting, so if they repair
    the property they get no benefit

    - [Landlord can internalize all the costs AND the benefits for
      repair]{.mark}

      - Landlord can charge more money after tenant moves out

- **2) Landlord tenant law should be consistent with consumer protection
  law**

  - Law implies warranty of fitness for consumer goods, makes sense we
    imply it for housing too

- **3) Unequal bargaining power**

  - Standardized form leases lead to unequal bargaining power

    - (Real concern if there's only one set of terms available, monopoly
      situation, all landlords are using the same form)

    - Empathized the standardized being the issue → not the form itself

    - No meaningful consumer choice for standardized monopoly

  - Race and class discrimination

    - More limits on places you can rent → more leverage
      sellers/landlords have as supply gets constrained

- **4) Poor quality housing hurts the entire city**

  - ... but why is it that this should fall entirely on landlords and
    not the entire city?

  - Why are public housing, vouchers not the solution? Why is the city
    (gov) not responsible for this? Who should be paying for this - the
    government/city or landlords?

[In sum, leases for urban dwelling units should be "treated like any
other contract"]{.underline}

- Treat leases like ordinary contracts → similar to *Sommer v. Kridel*
  rational

- Lee critiques the rationale that leases are really being treated like
  contracts

  - Unwaivable warranties are not typical in ordinary contract law...

## Leases: constructive eviction

## 

- **Constructive conviction** = someone's conduct substantially
  interfered w/ tenants use and enjoyment of the leased property AND the
  landlord can be held responsible for that conduct

- **No actual eviction, but the court will treat the tenant as if they
  were**

- **Under some circumstances you can get out of your lease
  constructively**

**Blackett v. Olanoff (1977):** Constructive Eviction, P must show: (1)
Someone\'s conduct **substantially interfered with the tenant\'s use or
enjoyment** of their property and (2) **landlord can be held
responsible** for that conduct (i.e. **knew when renting space to club
that noise would be a natural and probable consequence**, landlord
**could control** club); *tenant needs to have vacated property in
reasonable time*

- **Facts:** Landlord rented one parcel of land as a residency and an
  adjacent parcel to a club. The tenant of the residence claimed the
  club was too loud, so left and argued constructive eviction.

- **Rule:** In order to establish a claim for Constructive Eviction, you
  must show:

  - \(1\) Someone\'s conduct substantially interfered with the tenant\'s
    use or enjoyment of their property

  - The landlord can be held responsible for that conduct

- **Holding:** The club music being too loud to live in a residential
  apartment constituted a constructive eviction and thus the tenant can
  get out of their lease.

  - *For tenant to claim constructive eviction, tenant needs to have
    vacated property in reasonable time*

- **Reasoning**: Here, the music was very loud, no question it
  substantially interfered with tenants use + enjoyment, and the
  landlord can be held responsible for the club's conduct because **they
  knew when renting the space to operate a club**, noise would be a
  natural and probable consequence, and landlord also had ability to
  tell club to not be as noisey

  - Landlord **could control** the club (they had told club to quiet
    down before + they had for short period of time, shows they had
    control over tenant)

##  Leases: surrender  

**Gotlieb v. Taco Bell Corporation (1994)**: accepted surrender of
property by **operation of law/implied acceptance** when landlord sent
lease proposal to new potential tenant

 

- **Facts:** P agreed to lease property to TB for 20 years. TB agreed to
  get government approval to open the restaurant, but were permitted to
  cancel the lease if they couldn't get approval within a 6 permitting
  period beginning when the lease started. Community groups opposed TB.
  TB both filed for a permit and repudiated on the lease on the day
  before the end of the permitting period. P sued TB for breach of lease
  and for unpaid rent. D refused to pay. Over a year into the lease with
  TB, P leased the property to Rite Aid at a higher price than TB's
  lease was.

- **Holding:** Landlord accepted TB's surrender by operation of law /
  implied acceptance; landlord meeting with Rite Aid was more than a
  mere attempt to find another lease, it demonstrated intent to accept
  TB's surrender.

[[Landlords have 3 options when tenants attempt to repudiate/surrender a
lease before its expiration:]{.underline}]{.mark}

- 1\) Reject the repudiation and do nothing → tenant still liable for
  rent

- 2\) Accept repudiation, re-enter and relet the property to someone
  else for the **landlord's benefit**

  - Original lease no longer exists, tenant no longer owes any rent, and
    landlord just has lease w/ new tenant. **Attractive option for
    landlord if market rate has gone up / landlord can find tenants for
    higher lease**

- 3\) Reject the repudiation, enter the premises and relet **for the
  tenant's benefit**

  - Acting as the agent of the tenant

  - **Tenant remains liable for any difference in rent** between KP and
    Cover P

  - **Attractive option for landlord even if market rate hasn't gone up
    / if market rate has stayed the same / *maybe* even if market rate
    is lower** bc landlord doesn\'t need to worry about recovering
    tenants rent, landlord can find better tenant who will pay rent

[Surrender can be accepted 2 different ways]{.underline}

- An express agreement **or** by operation of law

  - **Express agreement** or implicitly by **operation of law**

  - Was there an express agreement between the parties that repudiation
    is accepted?

> **OR**

- Was there an implicit acceptance of the repudiation / acceptance of
  repudiation by the operation of law?

  - Some act so inconsistent with landlord/tenant relationship, which
    implies their intent to deem lease terminated, acceptance of
    repudiation would be implied → eg. changing the locks

- Applies even if there was an "outward refusal" to accept the
  repudiation

  - If landlord declares they rejected the repudiation, but changes the
    locks, the landlord has implicitly accepted the repudiation

[Once surrender is accepted, the tenant is off the hook. They owe
nothing for rent due after surrender.]{.underline}

- Here, P was not merely meeting with Rite Aid to try and find another
  lessee; **when P sent a lease proposal to Rite Aid, they implied
  acceptance of TB's surrender.**

## Leases: duty to mitigate

## 

**Sommer v. Kridel (1977)** → **landlord must make reasonable effort to
re-let the property,** while the tenant must pay the reasonable costs of
re-letting (majority rule for residential, but not commercial, property)

> ** **

**Facts:** D puts down deposit and signs 2 year lease, but breaks lease
a month before lease started. Landlord eventually relets apartment to
someone else at the same price, but 16 months after the apartment had
first been advertised. Landlord sues D for 16 months of rent plus the
security deposit

**Holding:** Duty to mitigate requires **landlord take reasonable
efforts** to lease property to someone else after lessee breaches, and
the landlord bears burden of proving they took reasonable efforts.

[Duty to mitigate is **majority rule in US for residential
property**]{.underline}

- Commercial leases → generally no duty to mitigate

[Tenant can plead both surrender and duty to mitigate in the
alternative]{.underline}

- Even if tenant didn't successfully surrender lease and is thus bound
  by it → landlord *still* might have duty to mitigate, which could in
  turn limit tenant's damages

- Which one applies, surrender or duty to mitigate, makes a financial
  difference to the tenant

[(1) If landlord doesn't accept tenant's surrender → landlord relets on
tenant's behalf]{.underline}

- Tenant is obligated to pay landlord's **reasonable costs of
  reletting**

- Tenant **has to pay its full rent** until landlord finds new tenant

  - **If new tenant's lease is less than original tenant's lease**,
    tenant will have to pay difference in rent for each month remaining
    on original lease

[(2) If landlord does accept tenant's surrender → landlord relets on
landlord's behalf]{.underline}

- Tenant has no obligation to pay any rent once landlord accepts
  surrender

  - After surrender is accepted → lease disappears

  - Even if landlord is reletting at a loss, tenant still doesn't have
    to pay

- **Attractive option if market rate has risen** → landlord can get
  higher rent, tenant doesn't need to be on the hook bc landlord doesn't
  need tenant's rent anymore bc landlord is getting it from someone
  else, everyone is happy

[If duty to mitigate applies...\[makes financial diff in time between
"surrender" + reletting\]]{.underline}

- Landlord has duty to take reasonable efforts to try and relet
  apartment

  - Court decides what is **reasonable amount of time** to relet
    apartment

- Tenant still liable for full rent during reasonable amount of time to
  relet apartment

- **If landlord relets apartment during reasonable amount of time**

  - Tenant is liable for full rent during reasonable amount of time +
    diff between relet rent and tenant's original rent *[if there is
    diff]{.underline}* → if surplus, landlord gets to keep

- **If landlord hasn't relet apartment after reasonable time has
  passed**

  - Tenant is liable for the difference between what the landlord
    *could* relet the apartment for and their rent

    - If Market Rate = Tenant Rent → tenant liable for \$0

    - If Market Rate \> Tenant Rent → tenant is also liable for \$0, but
      **[landlord should be incentivized to accept tenant's surrender +
      get a higher lease]{.mark}**

  - Big diff if market rent \< tenant's rent, and small/no diff if
    market rate is close to or equal to tenant's rent

- **If landlord is not reletting because the MP has dropped**

  - Landlord might [still save more \$ NOT fulfilling duty to
    mitigate]{.underline}

    - If fulfilled duty → landlord would lose \$ by having to rent at a
      lower price, and tenant isn't going to be liable once landlord
      relets apartment after reasonable time has passed

    - If didn't fulfill duty → landlord gets diff btw tenant's rent and
      MP, which is significant and close to tenant's rent

      - **Better for landlord to not fulfill duty + keep getting (almost
        all of) tenant's rent v. low market rent**

**Reletting on the tenants behalf** = not accepting surrender, tenant
still needs to be in picture

If landlord is reletting on behalf of the tenant, this means that the
landlord has not accepted the surrender of vacancy

- If lease is done on behalf of the tenant, surrender has been rejected

- If landlord accepts the surrender, landlord is reletting on HIS own
  behalf

- If landlord does NOT accept surrender, landlord is letting on TENANTS
  behalf

>  

**HYPO:**

- Leased at \$1000/month for 6 months

- 3 months after the lease begins, the tenant repudiates, and the
  landlord relets at \$700 a month

- If court finds the landlord to have accepted the surrender:

  - **Tenant now owes the landlord nothing on the remainder of the
    lease**

- If court finds the landlord rejected surrender + relet property on
  tenant\'s behalf:

  - Tenant now owes the landlord \$900 for the remaining 3 months

- Suppose in this jurisdiction, there is no duty to mitigate:

  - Then, for the first three months, the tenant owes \$3000

- However, if there is a duty to mitigate:

  - Court will say that the landlord must relet within a reasonable time
    to recover for the first three months prior to repudiation

  - the court will reduce damages to the amount that the landlord would
    have suffered if he had actually mitigated

    - As such, the tenant owes \$1000 for the first month, because it
      was reasonable for landlord to take a month

    - But after reasonable time, the tenant owes only diff btw KP and
      (Market Rate/MP)

    - Assuming that at this point \$700 is the MP for the rent, then the
      tenant would have owed \$300/month 🡪 \$600

    - Thus, the total amount owed would be \$1600

# TAKINGS

##  Eminent domain

## 

**[Power of eminent domain is often said to be an implied attribute of
sovereignty.]{.underline}**

- Gov must have this power merely by virtue of being a gov

  - To be a gov, gov has to have eminent domain power

- Eminent domain in US is both federal and state gov

- Power is typically delegated to smaller entities

  - Lower tier entities, commonly towns or cities

  - Sometimes might even be delegated to some businesses

    - Typically utility companies + railroads

  - Sometimes even delegated to individuals who have landlocked property
    (easements by necessity)

  - Sometimes individuals will use eminent domain to obtain easements of
    access across another person's property to avoid being landlocked

**[Eminent domain power is limited by both statutes and the
constitution.]{.underline}**

- 5th Amendment + 14th Amendment Due Process Clause, people get to be
  heard + challenge gov authority to exercise imminent domain

  - [Fifth Amendment Takings Clause]{.underline}

    - "Nor shall private property be taken for public use without just
      compensation" → federal provision, but has been incorporated to
      the states

    - Most state constitutions also have similar clauses → [but note
      they can be interpreted differently than the federal
      constitutional cause, even if they are written exactly the
      same]{.mark}

- Eminent domain proceeds are referred to as condemnation proceedings

  - Person who owns property being taken = condemnee

- Voluntary exchanges are often possible

  - Gov can purchase property instead of exercising eminent domain

**[Economic Justification for Eminent Domain]{.underline}**

- Property markets are often "thin markets" → real property is not
  "fungible", the unique aspects of real property are valued by owners,
  10 acres in one place is not the same as 10 acres in another place

  - *Recall common law doctrine → every property is unique*

- Owner of real property has a "local monopoly"

  - Often not possible to substitute some the property w/ some other
    property

  - Eg. you need to get property in that specific location, but you
    can't, bc owner has "local monopoly"

- Creates potential of **strategic holdout problems**

  - If project requires acquiring large amount of property w/o eminent
    domain, significant potential a land owner will hold out selling
    property to project owners

- Similar to concern re: issuing injunctions in ways that give one party
  too much bargaining power over another party → owner of local monopoly
  has significant bargaining leverage

  - Result is either project owner has to pay insane amount of property,
    has to build project around property, or may not be able to do
    project altogether → potential of **economic waste**

- Also possibility that people are just emotionally holding out → have
  value to the specific property

**[Calabrese & Melamed]{.underline}**

- Property rule protection means that if the entitlement changes hands,
  it will do so only at a price agreed to by the property owner

- If outcome of this is socially costly, then you can give the gov the
  entitlement and the property rule protection, which allows gov to
  confiscate the land to build railroad, etc, so that we all get the
  social benefit of the railroad

- The law does the OTHER Calabrese Melamed category

  - Gives entitlement to OWNER, but protects it only with **liability
    rule protection**

    - [This means entitlement can c**hange hands at a price that is set
      by an external entity** (in eminent domain, the market value of
      property)]{.mark} rather than what property owner would demand

      - Addresses holdout issues

**[Basic structure of takings law is in Fifth Amendment]{.underline}**

- "Nor shall private property be taken for public use without just
  compensation"

  - Two requirements of imminent domain power

  - [Must be for **public use** and **just compensation must be
    paid**]{.mark}

    - **Public use requirement**

      - Later 20th century, meaning was broadened from just things open
        to public to include more things to qualify

      - Having some **public purpose, public benefit**

        - SC gives great deference to state legislatures in determining
          the definition of this

    - **Just compensation requirement**

    - *US v. Miller*, USSC → property's fair market value

      - Defined as what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in
        cash

      - Does NOT include sentimental value, bc hard to quantify

<!-- -->

- Taking land to expand coast guard academy → yes

- Taking land from one private person to give to another private person
  → no

- Taking land from private owner to give to another private entity as
  part of a public economic development project? → is this public use or
  not?

## 

**Kelo v. City of New London, Connecticut USSC 2005**

**Facts:** D approved new development project that involved using
eminent domain authority to seize private property to sell to private
developers for a public economic development project. City argued the
purpose of project was to create new jobs and increase tax revenues from
the sale of property. Ps brought suit arguing project violated public
use requirement of Fifth Amendment.

**Holding:** Yes, city may validly exercise eminent domain authority to
take private property to distribute to private developers; this fulfills
the public use requirement required of the Fifth Amendment.

**[Reasoning]{.underline}**

- No pretext and city carefully formulated the plan

- No principled way to distinguish economic development from other
  public purposes → sometimes better serving the public must be done
  through private enterprise

  - However, merely generating tax revenue might not be a good enough
    reason

  - **Federalism argument →** great deference to states to determine
    public needs

    - States are free to establish more constitutional protections if
      you wish

- [Court rejects use by the public test - taking does not need to be
  specifically for use for the public, rather, can be taken for **public
  benefit**, as long as there is a genuine purpose to the public
  benefit]{.mark}

  - Pretext isn't allowed, but as long as its non-pretextual, that's
    good enough

[Policy reasons]{.underline}

- **Use by the public test is difficult to administer**

  - How much access to the public is enough?

    - For eg., schools are only accessible by children, but has a public
      benefit to everyone

    - For eg., can't just go on air force base

- **Use by the public test is pretty constrained**

  - Limits number of things that are going to qualify under this, and
    limiting it this way is impractical

[Doctrinal reasons]{.underline}

- *Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff* → state transferred ownership of
  residential property from the owners to the lessees

  - SC upheld→ public purpose was "emining the social and economic evils
    of land oligopoly"

- *Burman v. Parker* → state took over blighted area and redeveloped it
  for various purposes, including roads, schools but also leasing or
  selling the properties to private parties for redevelopment,
  specifically for affordable housing

  - SC upheld

**Dissent, O'Connor:** Beneficiaries of this sort of thing are those
that have political power; people who have political power will be
immune to takings whereas those w/ no political power will be harmed

- Transferring private property to another private entity is inherently
  problematic

- Slippery slope → so long as something more socially valuable exists,
  everything is prone to be taken

- Cf. *Hawaii + Burman*, both achieved DIRECT benefits, here thre is no
  affirmative harm that is being addressed

  - Indirect vs. direct benefit

**Dissent, Marshall:** there is racial bias in the application of these
takings

[Implications]{.underline}

- Many states have amended their state constitutions to prohibit the
  sorts of takings *Kelo* allowed

Today's principle justification is an economic one, based on the problem
of intractable holdouts

- Someone people will just refuse to relinquish their property

Eminent domain came up based on the problem above, but there are
constraints per prior notes

Kilo - expansive understanding of what satisfies public use requirement

Having some public purpose is enough → even if its taking property for
economic redevelopment by private organizations

##  Eminent domain: public use

**[Regulatory Takings]{.underline}**

- If gov is acting under police power - does NOT need to pay
  compensation

- If gov is acting eminent domain power - DOES have to pay just
  compensation

- If gov is addressing public nuisance, gov can force you to clean it up
  without compensation\...but gov CANNOT take your lot and turn it into
  a garden w/o compensation

- Two ways courts can decide if government action counts as a regulatory
  taking

  - [#1 Use categorical rules - **Per Se taking doctrine**]{.underline}

    - "X action counts as a regulatory undertaking"

    - Taking per se - if gov does X its a regulatory taking

    - Not many of them - two examples from USSC

      - *Loretto v. Teleprompter* → gov action will be a per se taking
        if [its gov authorization of a permanent physical
        occupation]{.mark}

      - *Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council* → gov action will be
        per se taking if it [eliminates ALL economically beneficial use
        of the land AND doesn't simply mirror the result state nuisance
        law would have produced]{.mark}

        - Not doing what nuisance law would already have done, and
          eliminates 100% of the economic value of the property

          - 99.99% NOT a per se taking

  - [#2 Use ad hoc rules]{.underline}

    - Much more common

    - Applies when gov regulations are less drastic but nevertheless
      constitute a taking

**Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon (1922) 🡪***First case to take ad hoc
approach to regulatory takings. Essentially overturned by Penn Central*

**Facts:** PA Coal leased out surface land to Mahon, with a provision
that they would continue to mine coal under his property and that Mahon
accepted the surface rights subject to any risks associated with the
company's coal mining. Even if mining damaged Mahon's property, he
agreed to be liable for all damages. Later, PA state legislature passed
the Kohler Act, which prohibited mining underneath surfaces with
residential dwellings, such as underneath Mahon's property. Mahon sought
an injunction against PA Coal to get them to stop mining under his
property.

**[Majority, Holmes]{.underline}**

- Regulation took entire property rights, and thus its a taking for
  constitutional purposes

- "Whether a regulation constitutes a taking is a **question of degree**
  and therefore cannot be disposed of by general propositions"

  - Depends on case individual facts

  - "If regulation goes too far, it'll be a taking" but also "not every
    incidental reduction in property value, caused by changes in general
    laws, should be compensated"

**[Dissent, Brandeis]{.underline}**

- Regulation only took one fraction of property right and was [not a
  regulatory taking]{.underline}

  - People should not be able to hide in contracts and away from gov
    regulation which is done to prevent harm

**[[Test for determining if regulation is considered a
taking]{.underline}]{.mark}**

- *H & B agreed ad hoc approach is right*

- *H & B agreed first 3 factors were relevant*

- *H & B disagreed how the factors should be applied to the present
  case*

- *B disagreed w/ H that 4th factor is relevant*

[#1 How big was the diminution in property value caused by the
regulation?]{.underline}

- **Holmes:** Property value should be assessed by the value of the coal
  pillars that the mine installed to prevent the surface from collapsing
  from their mining

  - Now, the pillars are worthless → **huge diminution in property
    value**

  - *Lee → why is the denominator the pillar value, and not the
    reduction of value of not being able to mine coal under this
    property?*

- **Brandeis:** Should look at total value of the mining rights that are
  involved in the contract, and see how much mining rights have been
  reduced

  - Mining rights involved in contract are only relatively small
    fraction → **insignificant diminution in property value**, property
    is still very valuable even if they can't mine just right under
    Mahon's home

- If you take Holmes' approach to the extreme ... every regulation
  prohibiting doing anything at all might trip this condition, since
  every regulation says you no longer have the right to do X

  - Epstein's argument → every prohibitory regulation is a taking
    (unless it prohibits a nuisance) and therefore gov has to compensate
    for it

[#2 Is activity being regulated a public nuisance?]{.underline} *[If yes
🡪 regulable under police power + gov doesn't owe compensation]{.mark}*

- Here, relevant interest was protecting people from harm from surface
  collapsing

  - **Holmes:** Regulation is not preventing harm to the general public,
    regulation does not address harm in homes collapsing due to mining
    \-- state could require mining companies to provide notice to the
    owners of the surface + require support, other ways to address this

  - **Brandeis:** This was exercise of police power + regulated
    obnoxious use that could be considered public nuance

[#3 Was there average reciprocity of advantage?]{.underline}

- Does this regulation, **in placing a burden on the plaintiff, also
  provide a benefit to the plaintiff** by requiring others to comply as
  well?

  - And is the benefit **roughly equal** to the burden?

    - YES 🡪 not regulatory undertaking bc there is average reciprocity
      of advantage

    - If not, then it looks more like a taking

    - **Holmes:** Here, no average reciprocity of advantage bc the
      burden is placed on the mining company/owners of mining rights and
      the benefit is being enjoyed by Mahon/owners of surface rights -
      *not* the mining companies

      - Mining company gets no benefit just bc other mining companies
        can't dig out coal

    - **Brandeis:** Agrees that there is no reciprocal advantage, but
      says it is not relevant → it is only relevant when regulation
      seeks to provide a **benefit** to public, rather than preventing
      harm to the public

      - *Lee doesn't like this argument, can you really tell a
        difference?*

[#4 Regulation destroyed existing property and contract
rights]{.underline}

- **Holmes** → regulation is destroying existing property + contract
  rights, it\'s a taking

- **Brandeis** → This analysis is not helpful for determining if its a
  regulatory taking, individuals shouldn't be able to sequester their
  rights from police power simply by making a private contract about
  those rights

  - Regulation shouldn't be stopped just bc you say you privately
    contracted to do XYZ, and thus no longer bound by such regulations

  - Brandeis believed we need good gov police stuff and no one should be
    able to hide from gov regulation, essentially

    - *Technically in above hypo you'd still be bound by the regs, but
      then able to get compensation*

- *Note, if you can't afford to pay the compensation, then you can't do
  the regulation at all*

**THE AD HOC APPROACH**

**Penn Central Transportation Company v. City of New York (1978)**

[→ landmarks preservation regulation preventing building was typical
regulation to promote common good and was not a regulatory taking
requiring just compensation]{.mark}

**Facts:** Penn Central needs \$ so wants to build office building on
top of Grand Central. NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission says no.
Penn Central sues for compensation, saying its a regulatory taking.

**Holding:** The regulation was not a taking requiring just
compensation.

[**[Test for if its a regulatory taking → NEW "ad hoc"]{.mark}**,
multifactor test for determining if a taking that requires
compensation]{.underline}

> **(1) Diminution in value**

- Economic detriment to party

- whole parcel for denominator

- Same as Brandeis' dissent in *Pennsylvania Coal*

> **(2) Extent to which regulation interferes with distinct investment
> backed expectations**

- Here, no.

- Primary expectation here was to use it as train terminal + they are
  still allowed to do that

- Regulation doesn't interfere w/ Penn Central's earning a reasonable
  rate of return, they can sell the TDR rights

> **(3) The character of gov action**

- Was it physical invasion that would be regulatory taking or did the
  regulation merely "adjust the benefits and burdens of economic life to
  promote the common good"?

  - Here, it was just telling them they can't build there, zoning
    regulation

  - Zoning = constitutional

  - Here too, general regulation for the common good

> **Dissent, Rehnquist:** Should have used PA coal factors, and if so,
> this was a taking. This was not abating a nuisance. [This was not
> exercise of police power.]{.mark} This was not trying to prevent
> dangerous conduct, or promote the safety, health or welfare of others.

- Here, all they cared about was the esthetics of the new building.

<!-- -->

- Difference between what is preventing a harm and providing a benefit
  is a little murky...

- Does not offer average reciprocity of advantage

  - Landmarks law, when applied to individual buildings rather than
    historic districts, imposes heavy burdens on a small fraction of NY
    property owners

  - Point of landmarks law is to preserve **historic district** where
    **everyone benefits**

    - Here, no one actually benefits from building not being built

  - Penn Railroad is not benefitting from the fact other things are
    landmarked, they are being singled out and being limited arbitrarily

    - This eliminates an existing property right, it effectively
      transfers servitude to the city that prevented building in a
      certain way

      - Servitude is usually bought or acquired via eminent domain

    - Any alteration now requires gov approval

      - Partial compensation for TDR is not fair market compensation

      - Paying compensation is not very expensive for taxpayers if you
        divide the expenses up among everyone

Eg. You are only allowed to build up to 50 stories, but you can buy
neighbor's TDR to build 48 stories to then build up to 98 stories.

Some courts explicitly apply the Penn Central factors, some don't.

I think he said something about zoning for parking for residents of a
nearby building is not a voluntary undertaking and is just zoning, and
also seems to have a reciprocal advantage bc the tenant protection →
ensure you have palace to park, implied warranty of habitability is also
not a taking. So protecting tenants by ensuring they have a habitable
apartment, but also have a place where they can park their car near
their apartment... what's the difference?

- Regulatory taking is as you can see highly controversial

- **Sovereign immunity usually protects government from being sued** for
  creating nuisances, etc.

  - Conceivably, you could sue gov for nuisance, but doing so can be
    challenging

- Guess is this would be played out would be, owner next to freeway
  would get extra compensation

If acting under police power → gov does not need to pay

If addressing public nuisance → gov does not need to pay
