1.  **[First Possession]{.underline}**

**First Possession:** used to establish ownership when the thing being
claimed is regarded as unowned, being up for grabs

***Pierson v. Post* →** first possession / hunter who trapped fox, D,
has possession

- Two people are hunting foxes on common land

- P about to catch a fox after pursuing it for awhile

- D sees P about to catch the fox and jumps in and catches the fox
  instead

- P does not pass tests for first possession that court establishes

- D passes majority specific rule for trappers → D gets first possession
  rights to fox

  - **Note that just because P does not get the fox does not
    automatically imply that D gets possession rights to the fox!**

**Majority**

- Motivation → for the sake of certainty and peace in society

  - First possession makes it clear (in theory) who has possession and
    by making it clear, there is (in theory) less debate

  - Reasoning is **purely instrumental** → cares about efficiency and
    predictable outcomes

    - Does not care about what is moral, or who morally deserves the fox

  - Decision should be based on **legal theorists and case law**

  - [General Rule]{.underline}

    - Pursuer is deemed to have possession if he:

      - \(1\) manifests an unequivocal intention to capture the animal
        AND

      - \(2\) has deprived the animal from his natural liberty AND

      - \(3\) has brought the animal within his certain control

  - "*Certain"* + "*unequivocal*" → test reflects the motivations of
    creating the test

  - It is the pursuers obligation to establish the certainty

  - Easier for pursuer to satisfy than dissent's rule

  - [Specific rule]{.underline}

    - For hunters → mortally wound the animal AND does not abandon
      pursuit = possession

    - For trappers → using nets or other means of interception, traps
      the animals so as to deprive them of their natural liberty

**Dissent** *Livingston*

- Motivation → want to encourage fox hunting, they are pests, if we
  allow people to swoop in and claim foxes that other people worked for,
  that will disincentivize fox hunting

  - Reasoning is also **purely instrumental**

- [General Rule]{.underline}

  - Pursuer is deemed to have possession if he:

    - \(1\) Shows intention to convert the animal to their own use AND

    - \(2\) the animal is either within reach of the pursuer OR the
      pursuer has a reasonable prospect of taking it

- Possession **does not require physical possession of the animal**

- This test is **easier to satisfy** for pursuer → does not require
  mortal wounding or physical trapping of animal

- This test is **less certain/straightforward than the majority's rule**

  - Recall motivation was not focused on certainty

  - Motivation = incentivizing hunting foxes

- Recommends **institutional competence**

  - fox hunter custom should decide what the rule is for possession

  - "Tribunal of sportsmen"

  - Customs are worthy of deference

  - Why does law say what the right answer is here?

**Theme Alert**

- **Should custom or formal law dictate possession law?**

  - **What is the optimal source of possession law?**

    - **"First in time" from *Pierson***

      - **Pro: makes it clear who has ownership (theoretically)**

      - **Con: can create wasteful competitions to be frist, can lead to
        overexploitation of resources (tragedy of commons)**

***Ghen v. Rich* →** custom dictates first possession rule

- Custom in Cape Cod is for whale finders to turn in bodies for finder
  fee \$

- Here whale finder deviates from custom and sells whale body for his
  own \$

  - Applying majority test from ***Pierson***, unclear if whale hunter
    "abandoned pursuit" due to sink, and float, nature of whale carcass

    - **Technical context of first possession is important + influences
      outcome after applying the legal rule**

      - Ex: here, the whalers win in this case, which is opposite of
        ***Pierson***

      - Harder for the pursuer to prove in the whale-hunting context vs.
        fox-hunting context

- **Holding:** we should follow custom here, whale finder did not have
  possession over whale carcass

  - Following custom did not conflict w/ common law, so it's
    **consistent**

    - *However court said even if it does conflict, they found
      compelling reasons to follow customs!!!!!*

  - Does not dangerously influence future law → applies to whaling
    context only so stakes are low to follow industry custom

    - *\*Perhaps when setting a broad-applying precedent, industry
      custom might not be followed\**

  - Customs work well, they evolve over time + adopt, are successful

  - Following custom is **necessary to incentivize industry to
    continue**

  - Custom seems **fair** (custom rewards finders \$)

**[Criticisms of following custom for law]{.underline}**

- Made by groups that have special interests in mind

  - Can be bias, favor certain groups

  - Groups are often built on structures of inequalities

- Customs might not be socially good

  - Who made custom?

  - Who is benefitting from custom?

- When custom changes, how does law change?

- How does Judge determine what custom is?

- If custom is prevailing over law only sometimes, how do people know
  when custom applies and which custom applies?

  - Custom can make the law unclear and difficult to comply with

2.  **[Tragedy of the Commons]{.underline}**

→ Degradation of the environment whenever many individuals use a scarce
resource in common

- Property law purpose is to prevent the Tragedy of the Commons

  - **Utilitarian justification**

  - Not a moral justification, not about people deserving things

**Potential Solutions to Tragedy of the Commons**

- **Centralized system approach approach**

  - central gov controls most natural resource systems

- **Privatization approach**

  - private property rights

- **Alternative approach**

  - Not private property system, but a system where rights to use the
    site and the duties that come with use are well defined and
    self-enforced by the users

  - Not a centralized system, but national legislation gives such
    cooperatives jurisdiction over "local arrangements"

    - local officials' roles are legit

**Anticommons**: too many people have the power to exclude people from
the commons, so no one is able to use the resource

**Semicommons**: given resource is subject to private exclusion rights
in some uses or along some dimensions, but is a commons/open access for
other purposes or along other dimensions

→ Ex: content that is patented allowed to be copied for specific uses,
like critiques

3.  **[Water Rights]{.underline}**

- Riparian rights → whoever owns the land next to the water owns the
  rights to the water

- Distinction between **defined body of water** (stream, lake) **+
  diffuse water** (water flowing everywhere, spilling out of somewhere)

**#1: Natural Flow Approach - does not apply in the US**

- Anyone is able to remove water from a source so long as you do not
  **disrupt the natural flow of the water**

  - Implicit idea that everyone is entitled an equal amount, everyone
    gets the same so long as they don't disrupt the natural flow

  - Can prevent beneficial use of water

    - If even a small amount removed impacts natural flow, could wind up
      w/ most water unused

  - Can present **holdout problem**

    - You can use amount that does disturb natural flow if you get
      permission from riparian owners downstream

      - But when you get to last riparian owner, they will likely hold
        out for \$\$\$\$

  - Does not apply in the US bc US legal system generally favors
    **productive property use**

**#2: Reasonable Use Approach → East Coast**

- Allows for some use of water so long as the use is reasonable

- Allows for lower-productive activity (even if not productive, if
  reasonable, use is ok)

- Reasonable = socially valuable

  - Court determines what is socially valuable

  - Reasonable changes over time!

  - Con; what is socially valuable and to who?

- ***Evans v. Merriweather***

  - Rejects natural flow approach

  - **Holding:** Riparian owner is allowed to use the water so long as
    use is **reasonable + use is not more injurious than is necessary to
    accomplish reasonable use**

  - Natural + essential use takes priority over artificial,
    non-essential use

    - Artificial use = for commercial use, \$, or increased comfort

    - Essential use = drinking water

      - Depends on the environmental aspects of country

  - Natural use always takes priority

    - Upstream user can wholly use a stream to satisfy natural wants if
      downstream wants are entirely artificial

  - Both riparian owners had artificial uses, thus both can use it, but
    neither has a priority

    - However Evans' dam was illegal so Merriweather won

**#3: First Appropriation Approach → West Coast**

- Who started using the water first?

- Disregards if use is reasonable or efficient

- Rewards initiative, promotes economic development

- Con: might be hard to determine who's "first"

- Con: w/o reasonable requirement, could be misuse of water

- ***Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch***

- Same set of facts as ***Evans v. Merriweather*** but outcome is
  different

  - Coffin, downstream from LHD, breaches LHD's land to get water when
    water levels drop

  - LHD sues Coffin

  - **Holding:** First appropriation approach is the law in CO, not the
    reasonable use, riparian rule on the East Coast due to the **dry,
    arid environment of CO**

    - **First appropriator of water from defined body of water for a
      [beneficial purpose]{.underline}** **has a prior right to the
      extent of the first appropriation**

      - #1 First Appropriator

      - #2 Beneficial Purpose

        - Diverting water to dry place for agriculture = beneficial

      - #3 Your rights are to the extent of the first appropriation /
        what you were first using for a beneficial purpose

        - If you want to use more later, even for beneficial use, you
          cannot use more than you first appropriated if there is a
          downstream user

**Rule for Diffuse Water**

- Diffuse water is treated as a common enemy of mankind

  - Every landowner has a right to use self-help to expel diffuse water
    from their property, **even if that means pushing the water onto
    someone else's property**

    - Note this right is reciprocal - the "someone else" will have every
      right to push the water back onto your property!

    - Some jurisdictions have a requirement that the steps taken to
      expel the water be **reasonable** (i.e. "reasonable requirement")

**[Summary of Water Right Tests]{.underline}**

1.  **Egalitarian Natural Flow Approach**

    - Applies in UK, not in US

    - Anyone can use as much water as they want so long as they do not
      disturb the natural flow of the water

2.  **Riparian Owner Reasonable Use Approach**

    - Applies in East Coast of US

    - Riparian owner can use water so long as the use is:

      - **Reasonable**

        1.  Natural + essential use has priority over artificial,
            non-essential use

        2.  Depends on the environmental aspects of setting

      - **Use is not more injurious than is necessary to accomplish
        reasonable use**

*If both riparian owners have artificial uses, both can use it, but
neither has a priority*

3.  **First Appropriation Approach**

    - Applies to West Coast of US - dry, arid environments

    - Right to water so long as you:

      - Are the first appropriator

      - Are using water for beneficial purpose

      - Your use is limited to the extent of the first appropriate use

4.  **[Ad Coelum + Nemo Dat]{.underline}**

- **Ad Coelum:** Land owner owns the space above and below their surface
  property

- This is an example of a **correlative rights approach to property**

  - **Rights to one resource correlate to rights to another resource**

    - Based on the property that you are entitled to, you are also
      entitled to X

- ***Edward v. Sims*** → ad coelum / use of subterranean land of which
  you do not have surface rights to requires you to **share profits**
  with surface right owner

  - Court applied ad coelum doctrine + said that cave creator had to
    share his profits w/ neighbor who owned some property above the mine

  - **Dissent:** ad coelum should NOT apply to this case

    - [Ad coelum/possession rule should be owners of land own everything
      on and above and below the land **to the extent the owner
      can:**]{.mark}

      - **[subject the land to their dominion and control AND]{.mark}**

      - **[Use it for their own benefit]{.mark}**

        - [If they can't benefit from it, and it would benefit others, P
          has no right to it]{.mark}

    - P did not have access to the entrance of cave from their own
      property, D had the access to the cave on his property; D did not
      dig the cave out, make it tourist attraction, didn't do any of the
      work

    - Implies active users should be rewarded

    - P couldn't have exercised control over the space below, had no way
      of doing so

    - What D owed was something "indefinable... it was a vision
      translated to reality"

- **Nemo Dat:** You can't sell what you ain't got!

5.  **[Sequential Possession]{.underline}**

- Relativity of title → multiple persons claim property on same theory
  other than purchase or gift from TO

- Multiple persons serially claim property

- ***Armory v. Delamirie***

  - Finder maintains true ownership against all others *except for TO*

    - You cannot steal from a finder just because he's not the TO

- ***Clark v. Maloney***

  - 1st finder prevails over 2nd finder

- ***Anderson v. Goldberg***

  - 1st converter prevails over 2nd converter

    - 1st converter, even if taking possession by tort (like trespass),
      has right to retain possession against someone else (second
      converter)

- **Jus terri defense:**

  - Attempting to claim possessory rights based on the legal title in
    another third party

  - A sues B seeking to recover a bike. A presents evidence C is the
    true owner of the bike.

    - → A has failed to show that A has a possessory interest in the
      bike over B

- **Nemo dat quod non habet**

  - No one gives what he does not have

  - You can only give what you have

  - If A shared ownership of parcel w/ C, and A sells their share to B

    - C winds up sharing ownership w/ C

- **Prior in time, prior in right**

  - If A sells parcel to B and A "sells" parcel again to C

    - B gets to keep parcel + C gets nothing

    - B bought the parcel first, B was prior in time, prior in right,
      because, nemo dat

6.  **[Ownership of Body Parts]{.underline}**

***Moore v. Regents →*** patient does not have property rights to body
parts, once they have left the body, to uphold conversion claim

- Patient DOES have a right to adequate disclosure/give informed consent

  - If body parts are going to be used for experimentation or anything
    else

- **Policy concerns**

  - Right for medical researchers doing cancer treatment outweighs right
    of patients individual rights

  - Need to encourage medical research, not discourage

  - Maximize productive use by having general rule that body part is
    owned by hospital

  - Individual rights can be acknowledged by offering informed consent

  - **Institutional competence**

    - Just as in *Ghen* + dissent in *Pierson*, defer to those familiar
      w/ the custom → court shouldn't decide complex policy matters,
      legislature should

- **Dissent:** He did have ownership of spleen, but sometimes property
  rights come w/ restrictions

7.  **[Adverse Possession]{.underline}**

- AP doctrine is based on the legal theory persistent throughout US
  property law

  - Incentives **active possessors**

- Allows AP to take possession of real property from the true owner

**#1 Actual**

- Possessory acts vary w/ character of land, have to use it as a
  landowner would

  - ***Scott v. Anderson-Tully*** → AP painted fence, cut timber, issued
    hunting license for underdeveloped land

- You have to actually poss it, if you physically occupy only part of
  the property, that is not actual

**#2 Exclusive**

- Cannot share possession w/ anyone else

- Have to exclude others

- Doesn't mean no one else can use property w/ permission

**#3 Open + Notorious**

- Make AP's intention clear to take possession

**#4 Continuous**

- ***Howard v. Kunto →*** summer occupancy = continuous if property is
  only summer occupancy type of property

**#5 Adverse or Hostile under a claim of right (color of title)**

> [3 different approaches adopted:]{.underline}

- 1\) AP must act in good faith

  - *NY requires reasonable basis for belief you own property*

  - ***Carpenter v. Ruperto* →** court says AP acting in bad faith
    cannot claim AP, policy concern that awarding bad faith conduct
    encourages such conduct

- 2\) AP must act in bad faith

  - *"Maine rule" but no jurisdiction even has this rule anymore*

- 3\) Doesn't matter if AP acted in good or bad faith

  - *"Connecticut rule", commonly favored by academics*

  - However, evidence indicates **courts implicitly do care about good
    faith** / favor possessors who act in good faith

  - Only a minority of jurisdictions require color of title + even if
    not required, color of title can provide certain advantages

    - Ex: even if you only occupy 2/40 acres, if you have color of title
      to all 40 acres, this can be seen as **constructive occupation of
      entire property** and help you fulfill requirements for AP

**#6 For the statutorily required time**

- At least 5 yrs, 5-21 years

- **Tacking:** AP can "tack" their time occupying the property to the
  time that the preceding AP occupied the property so long as the
  preceding and current APs have **privity**

  - I.e. if the preceding AP gave the deed to the current AP = privity

  - Privity = "Reasonable connection between the person conveying the
    property and the person receiving them"

  - ***Howard v. Kunto →*** summer occupancy - tacking was allowed even
    tho they had only been in summer house for 1 year, even less

- **Disability Exception:** if true owner suffers disability, time on
  statutory clock might pause

  - Owner has to be disabled by the time the AP began

**#7** Some jurisdictions also require possession to be **peaceful** -
*Scott v. Anderson-Tully*

- Peaceful in *Scott* bc no one complained about the "property line"
  Anderson-Tully drew and no one interfered with their use

<!-- -->

- **[[Permission from the true owner defeats AP!]{.underline}]{.mark}**

  - It makes the possession non-adverse

**[Justifications of AP Doctrine]{.underline}**

- **1) Reliance interest**

  - Possessor is attached to the property by virtue of possessing it for
    awhile

  - Possessor has come to rely on the property

  - Endowment effect: you place higher value on things you are told are
    yours vs. other people's things

  - Unfair now to take it away from AP

- **2) Favoring active users**

  - Property law in the US generally favors active users of property

  - Discourages TOs from sleeping on their rights

    - Criticism → this incentivizes active exploitation of land
      resources + discourages passive, preservationist uses

- **3) Decreasing information / transaction costs for determining
  title**

  - Spend less time figuring out who the actual owner is

- **Note: none of these justifications involve "good faith"**

  - So, why should AP require good faith?

8.  **[Right to Exclude]{.underline}**

- A central right of real property ownership is the right to exclude
  others from being on your property w/o your permission

- Tort that protects the right to exclude = trespass

- Real property owners can be awarded both **nominal + punitive
  damages**

  - \...despite no actual damage or loss, despite no compensatory
    damages

  - Theory is that property owner DID experience harm

    - They lost their right to exclude

    - Compensatory damages are required for unintentional, not
      intentional like trespass, torts

- **Court efficiency** → courts need not decide what is "reasonable",
  right to exclude is absolute + parties can discuss amongst themselves
  if they want to give permission

- ***Jacque v. Steenberg Homes* →** property owner can recover \$1 in
  nominal + \$100K in punitive damages for intentional trespass, **[even
  absent any harm]{.underline}**

***Hinman v. Pacific Air Transport* →** right to exclude for space
above/below land limited to extent you actually use space

- Court declines to recognize ad coelum as law

  - Landowner owns the airspace that they **actually use**

  - [Ad coelum really means you have the right to exclude to the extent
    that you actually use the property - **right to use space above your
    property w/o interference**]{.mark}

  - "You can't own infinity" → notion of ownership is abstract
    conception

    - Similar to dissent in *Edwards* cave case → ownership of cave
      below your property that you can't even access is abstract,
      doesn't work

- Air + sea incapable of private ownership except to the extent they can
  actually be used

  - **Trespass** = person flying above either

    - Injures land below, OR

    - [Actually interferes with owners beneficial use of the
      land]{.mark}

      - *i.e. , even if you DON'T use the air space above your land (and
        thus you don't have a right to the space), if someone else is
        doing something in the air space that disturbs your beneficial
        use of the surface land, then you can bring a trespass claim
        against them*

- Court enjoys Hinman to take spite fence down + but says injunction
  could be limited if he had "good faith" building project

- **Equitable relief**

  - Equity court damages = ordering someone to do something

    - Vs. law court damages = money

<!-- -->

- ***Baker v. Howard County*** → P can recover equitable relief as a
  remedy for tort of repeated trespass

  - D repeatedly (continually) trespassed on P's property to hunt

  - D's dogs killed P's chickens, P shot some of D's dogs

  - **Holding:** P can get an injunction from court to order D to stop
    trespassing bc **equitable relief is available as a remedy**

  - **Requirements for equitable relief:**

> [1) P does not have any adequate remedy at law]{.underline}

- Injury is "tangible + incapable of measurement"

> [2) P has to come to court w/ clean hands]{.underline}

- Shooting the dogs wasn't so horrible

<!-- -->

- [3) There is a balance between hardships of P + D]{.underline}
  *typically this is another traditional requirement, was used in Golden
  Press but not in Baker*

  - Considers hardship of D if injunction is issued balanced against
    hardship of P if injunction is not issued

  - If balance is too askew, court may still decline to issue an
    injunction, even if other 2 elements are met

  - If good faith encroachment, court is more likely to deny injunction

  - If bad faith encroachment, court is more likely to grant injunction
    **regardless of imbalance hardship to D**

<!-- -->

- ***Pile v. Pedrick* →** injunctive relief awarded for continuous
  trespass done in good faith

  - Despite trespass being quite harmless + injunction being quite
    harmful, burdensome to D, court grants injunctive relief for P

  - Court does not care that trespass was done inadvertently (in good
    faith)

  - Court does not explain why injunctive relief makes more sense v.
    damages

  - This case appears to be outlier and pre-dates *Golden Press*

  - **Absolutist approach →** prop owners have right to exclude + get
    injunctive relief, no matter how much relief will harm other party

- ***Golden Press v. Rylands* →** injunctive relief denied for
  continuous trespass done in good faith

  - Same facts as *Pile*, but opposite result

  - When D's encroachment is:

    - **Unintentional** + slight

    - Does not negatively impact P's use

    - Damages are small + fairly compensable

    - Cost of removal causes grave hardship / is unconscionable

      - → injunctive relief may be denied

  - Court likely to **deny injunctive relief when encroachment is
    unintentional**

  - Court likely to **award injunctive relief when encroachment is
    intentional / in bad faith**

    - [Regardless of expense of removal]{.mark}

  - Reasoning → D would have unequal bargaining power for negotiations
    after case is settled, not fair that P who has injunction has so
    much leverage over D

  - **[Shifts from *Pile* to considering if encroachment was bad/good
    faith, and having that influence if willing to grant
    injuction]{.underline}**

**[Enforcement of Right to Exclude]{.underline}**

- Injunction ordering trespasser to do something *aka equity remedy*

- Monetary damages

- Criminal law

  - Criminal trespass

- Civil actions protecting real property

  - Trespass, action for ejectment, action for nuisance

- Self Help

  - Controversial forms → using reasonable force to prevent or terminate
    trespass

  - Uncontroversial forms → walls, locks

**[Self Help]{.underline}**

- ***Berg v. Wiley* →** self-help is never allowed bc of risk of
  violence

  - Landlord using self-help + changing locks on P to terminate P's
    trespass of **commercial property** was not ok

  - Court overturns common law rule (D loses under either rule)

> [Traditional common law rule]{.underline}

**Self help is allowed when**

- 1\) landowner is entitled to possession, AND

- 2\) means of self help is peaceable

  - Here, changing locks was **not peaceable** bc here was history of
    **keen animosity** between parties → risk of violence

[Modern common law rule court creates]{.underline}

- **Self help is never available** to dispossess a tenant who is still
  in possession of property and has not abandoned or voluntarily
  surrendered it. Landlord has to resort to judicial process.

→ Court was okay deviating from common law rule here + setting precedent
bc under either rule, defendant lost

- ***Williams v. Ford Motor Credit Company*** → self-help for
  repossession of personal property is allowed only if there is no risk
  of violence

  - Article 9 of UCC allows repossession without judicial process **if
    it can be done w/o breach of peace** → traditional common law also
    allows self-help when peaceable

  - If there is risk of violence = cannot self-help

    - Here, court held no risk of violence in the interaction between
      woman + repo men

  - Policy interest → we have to allow repos to take personal property,
    if we didn't, credit loans would be riskier + credit cost would go
    up

  - **Dissent** → could have led to violence, that is matter of fact to
    go to jury, not matter of law

    - Repo should be required to retreat when both are true:

      - 1\) Detection has occurred (Cathy knows you're there)

      - 2\) Confrontation ensues

        - *Obvi if you have 2, you have 1*

<!-- -->

- **Most courts agree w/ majority in *Williams* and allow for self-help
  for repossession of personal property**

  - Some courts have also recently allowed self-help in commercial
    landlord tenant disputes as well in contrast w/ *Berg* → theory
    being less tense, less chance of violence in commercial dispute v.
    personal / home dispute

**[Exceptions to right to exclude]{.underline}**

- When burden of exclusion is high on society, we switch from exclusion
  approach to **governance approach**

  - Government gets to limit right to exclude

- Necessity, Custom, Public Policy = all exceptions

<!-- -->

- ***Ploof v. Putnam* →** exception to right to exclude is when trespass
  is [necessary]{.underline}

  - "Necessity exception 'applies with special force to the preservation
    of human life"

- ***McConico v. Singleton* →** exception to right to exclude when
  [custom]{.underline} says so

  - Owner does not have right to prevent others from hunting on
    **un-enclosed + un-improved lands** because custom says so

  - Custom, British common law, legislation all favors an exception to
    right to exclude in this context

    - Hunting is good for militias, reduces need for standing armies
      post-tyranny of British empire

  - Maybe case would have went other way if legislature had conflicted
    w/ custom?!?!?!?!

    - Custom can trump common law, but likely statute cannot

- ***State v. Shack*** → exception to right to exclude when [public
  policy concern]{.underline} re: human values are at stake

  - Migrant workers do not have economic + political power, like
    *Carolene Products* case, need to protect minorities rights bc they
    are not protected by democratic system

  - Private property owner did not have right to exclude social service
    workers bc of public policy concern re: human rights + values for
    medical services

  - **Sic utere principle →** use your property in such a way that you
    don't harm someone else

    - Property rights are not absolute

  - **Note this case is not influential in the law**

**Rules v. Standards**

- Rules = simple + general

  - Generate conclusions at low costs, relatively cheap to apply

    - Ex: certain speed limit, certain height

  - Easy to figure out if you are complying or not

  - Inflexible + insensitive to nuances of particular situations

  - Have to think a lot before coming up w/ rule

  - Ex: *Jacque*

- Standards = looser, more vague

  - Relatively cheap to create but higher cost to apply

    - Ex: drive at safe speed, can ride if safe to ride

  - Cultural cognition concerns → can be applied unfairly

  - Sensitive to particularities of situation (weather conditions etc0

    - More complex, need to consider many factors

  - Ex: *State v. Shack**,*** property serving human needs = what does
    that mean?

**Public Accomodation Laws**

- Owners of public accommodations have duty to:

  - Not discriminate

  - Charge customers reasonable rate for services they provide

- Civil Rights Act of 1964

  - Cannot discriminate on basis of race

- These are all public policy exceptions

<!-- -->

- ***Uston v. Resorts International*** → more open to public use private
  property is, more private property owner has to accommodate rights of
  general public to come onto property

  - More that property is used to increase private profit [by means of
    using the public]{.underline}, the more property must accommodate
    public members

  - Common law right to exclude is limited by **competing right of
    reasonable access to public places**

    - Reasonable varies, but here excluding winning gambler = not
      reasonable

- ***Shelley v. Kraemer →*** racially discriminatory covenants are not
  judicially enforceable

  - Even though covenant was private covenant, judicial enforcement =
    state action

    - Thus 14th Amendment applies + covenant is violation of equal
      protection law

**[9. Mistaken Improvement]{.underline}**

- ***Producers Lumber v. Olney Building Co.***

  - [Traditional rule]{.underline}

    - If improver puts building on someone's land w/o landowners
      consent, it becomes a **fixture** and belongs to landowner

    - Motivation → incentivizes builders to check + confirm title before
      building

  - [Exception to rule]{.underline}

    - If improver builds in **good faith** belief they own the property
      on which they are building, **equitable remedies might be
      available to builder**

      - If improvement is movable, improver might be able to just take
        movable improvement *→ obvi less common*

      - [Principle of restitution]{.underline}

      - 1\) Landowner can buy improvement at market rate

      - 2\) Improver can buy land at market rate for land prior to
        improvement

      - 3\) Court can order selling both land + improvement via auction
        to third party + divide proportionately \$ between landowner +
        improver

        - **Purpose - land + building is owned by same person**

        - These are the ONLY REMEDIES AVAILABLE to good faith mistaken
          improvers → cannot just demolish building w/o property owners
          consent like D did here

  - Here, D was not acting in good faith bc **he resorted to self-help**
    by knocking building down

    - Bc D did not act in good faith, D does not get exception, thus
      house becomes fixture + D has to pay P for the house he built +
      knocked down (!!!!!)

  - Equity only available for mistaken improvers with **clean hands**

**[10. Abandonment + Destruction of Real Property]{.underline}**

- ***Pocono Spring v. McKenzie*** → **cannot abandon real property**

  - To abandon real or personal property in PA, owner has to:

    - 1\) voluntarily relinquish the title, claim, right, and possession

    - 2\) do so with the intention of terminating ownership

    - 3\) without vesting title / right in any other person

      - Selling it, gifting it, etc.

  - Here, D failed to fulfill element #1, he tried to, but failed

  - Common law prohibits abandonment bc

    - Abandonment could encourage socially inefficient behavior

      - Making a toxic mess + then leaving it

      - Avoiding internalizing costs you created by using property as
        you did

- ***Eyerman v. Mercantile Trust Co.* → cannot destroy real property**

  - Testator's wish in will to destroy building is not upheld, neighbors
    win injunction

  - Court says destruction was unnecessary

    - Property value would be diminished, neighbors values would be
      diminished

    - Need for housing in area

    - Property has historical value + demolition would affect aesthetic
      appeal of neighborhood

  - **Dissent:** testator freedom, they should be able to do what they
    want

    - *Prof. Lee also discussed horrible things that happened in house,
      maybe reasoning why she wanted to knock it down, isn't that her
      right?*

**11. [Transfer]{.underline}**

- Transfer = trade or a gift

**[Justifications for Transfer]{.underline}**

- Enhances autonomy

  - Allows you to get rid of things that you do not want + acquire
    things that you do want

- Promotes efficiency

  - Allows society to make mutually beneficial exchanges → wealthy
    society

  - Win-win trade situations

- Enhances power of owners because it enables them to designate the
  successor

  - Controversial justification

    - Counter-argument → generational wealth is a bad thing

  - Can work in a bad way like in *Shelley v. Kramer*, can also work in
    a good way

**[Common law favors restraint on alienation]{.underline}**

- In favor of advantages to exchange, absolute restraint on alienage is
  void

  - X is not allowed to transfer property to Y on condition Y will never
    transfer it to anyone else

    - Law will not enforce the transfer w/ this condition, the restraint
      is not valid (transfer might still be valid)

<!-- -->

- In several contexts, law will recognize a transfer as having occurred
  ONLY IF:

  - There has been **actual delivery** to the recipient of either the
    thing itself or some evidence of title to the thing

    - For a gift to be legally effective, to have legally been given,
      you have to deliver the item to the recipient or alternatively a
      deed of gift

      - You have to transfer a **thing**

    - Deeds must be signed, sealed, and delivered

***Irons v. Smallpiece*** 1819, British case → no gift unless there is
**actual delivery of item**

- Father did not actually give son possession of horses, so son could
  not recover on trover action

***Foster v. Rice*** 1955 → no gift bc there was no actual delivery
while donor was alive

- No gift because there was **no delivery while donor was alive**

  - Rice did not deliver items to husband before she died, thus gift was
    not effective

  - There must be an affirmative act by the owner to the receiver

  - The note demonstrated an **intent** to give a gift, but NOT enough
    to constitute a transfer

    - **You must have actual delivery!**

    - Note is meaningless

- [Dissent]{.underline}

  - Intent to transfer is clear, where are we being absurd and requiring
    this symbolic, ceremonial physical transfer? Note she left was
    enough

    - To require somehow husband to bring stuff in hospital room is
      ridiculous + impractical

***Gilbert v. McPadden*** 1936 → no gift bc the deed must be actually
delivered to be transferred

- **Transfer of both gift and DEEDS requires actual delivery**

  - Father who nominally sold his deed to kid but didn't hand it over to
    them, did not vacate, and never handed deed over to kids did not
    transfer deed to kids

  - **Deeds are not effective until delivered**

    - **An intent to deliver is not sufficient**

- You can have an **agent** deliver deeds on your behalf, doesn't have
  to necessarily be you

**12. [Licenses, Bailments, and Servitudes]{.underline}**

*Aka partial relinquishment*

a)  **[Licenses]{.underline}**

- **Licenses =** way to waive the right to exclude

  - Temporary, revocable

  - Less durable than other types, more transitory, more difficult to be
    revoked

- Licenses are NOT interests in land, so statute of frauds does not
  apply

  - Licenses do not need to be in writing, you do not need to put it in
    writing to have someone come to your house

***Wood v. Leadbitter*** 1845

- Licenses are **by nature revocable at any time**

  - Licenses coupled with grants are **irrevocable**

- Rationale is that grantor is estopped from defeating his own grant

  - License is irrevocable until grant is complete

b)  **[Bailments]{.underline}**

- Bailments transfer possession or custody of an item **temporarily**

  - Bailor → owner who temporarily relinquishes possession in a bail

  - Bailee → party who temporarily possesses item

**[Questions for bailment cases:\]{.underline}
#1** → Did a bailment exist?

***Allen v. Hyatt*** 1984 **bailment existed in attended parking
garage**

- Bailment was created when Allen left his car in supervised parking
  lot, despite the ticket saying no bailment

  - Policy reasoning: garage owner is **better situated** to protect car
    than the car owner who leaves car in garage

  - Garage can **distribute cost of risk** across many people by
    charging a higher fee to everyone who wants to park their car there

**#2** → what duty did the bailee have to the bailor?

- Joseph Story - duty of care varies depending on purpose for which
  bailment is created

  - **#1 - When bailment is for the sole benefit of the bailor**

    - Law only requires [slight diligence]{.underline} on the part of
      the bailee

    - Bailee is only responsible for gross neglect

    - I.e. if A gives B something only for As benefit, B is required to
      exercise only [slight diligence]{.underline} in taking care of the
      thing

    - Law will hold you liable for losses that resulted only from [gross
      neglect]{.underline}

  - **#2 - When bailment is for the sole benefit of the bailee**

    - Law requires [great diligence]{.underline} on part of bailee and
      makes him responsible for even slight neglect

    - Bailee is required to exercise [great diligence]{.underline} in
      taking care of thing

    - Law will hold make you liable for losses that were the result of
      even [slight neglect]{.underline}

  - **#3** **When the bailment is reciprocally beneficial to both the
    bailor and bailee**

    - Law requires ordinary due diligence on part of bailee

    - Bailee is responsible for losses resulting from [ordinary
      neglect]{.underline}

    - Bailee has to exercise ordinary due diligence taking care of item

    - Court will hold you liable for losses caused by [ordinary
      neglect]{.underline}

    - Ex: dropping coat off at dry cleaner

- A - Story's analysis (above) of duty of care is historically
  influential

- B - The **modern alternative** is to have a **standard of reasonable
  care for all bailments**

  - Look at the circumstances of the particular case

  - Did the bailee receive compensation, were they paid?

  - Whose benefit was the bailment for?

- C - Empirical work of Richard Helmholtz who has found that courts seem
  not to really use a uniform standard of reasonable care

  - Rather, they tend to take approach like Story's analysis

    - Different levels of care depending on type of bailment

  - Also, courts seem to be stricter about missing delivery of goods
    rather then they are about damaging goods

    - I.e. missing goods = worse than damaging goods

      - Courts will be harsher on bailee that gives item to wrong person
        vs. bailee that damages goods or loses goods

<!-- -->

- Big question, issue w/ these duties of care → to what extent can they
  be modified by contract?

  - Are these default duties or are these the actual duties that will
    apply **regardless of what the contract says?**

    - Answer to these Qs is unclear, for ex, *Allen v. Hyatt Regency*,
      hotel tried to modify disclaimer + court disregarded disclaimer of
      no bailment

      - [Is it that you can't modify contract to say no bailment, or
        could you modify the bailment and say "but we have lowest duty
        of care"? Maybe the latter would work? Unclear]{.mark}

***[Cowen v. Presswich]{.underline}*** 1922 duty of care differs for
involuntary/voluntary bailments, courts are likely more lenient for
damage or loss and NOT lenient for misdelivery

- Delivery for a voluntary bailment is an absolute duty of care →
  delivery to the wrong person is not excused for any reason, good
  faith, innocence, etc.

  - Imposing this absolute duty is not unfair to defendant because
    defendant also failed to use **reasonable measures** to return the
    bond

    - Could have called P, could have sent their own messenger

  - Implies a **duty of reasonable care**

- [Dissent]{.underline}

  - This was an involuntary bailment, D did not necessary accept the
    item, they just picked it up

    - Slot for bonds was not an open invitation, it was to accept
      certain specified and expected bonds

  - **You cannot impose obligations on people by giving them things
    involuntarily**

    - **Involuntary bailee = no obligation**

  - No liability for D so long as D takes **reasonable means** to return
    it

    - \**Although dissent frames this in absolute terms, they seem to be
      saying not that involuntary bailees have NO duty, rather that they
      have a duty of **reasonable care** to return the property\**

  - Note both majority + dissent in this case feel the pull towards
    having a **reasonable care** standard without saying it explicitly

<!-- -->

- Everything is above is the first iteration of this case but then later
  the same yr, appellate division reverses the holding that there is an
  absolute duty and agrees w/ dissent

  - Dissent's reasoning becomes holding on appeal

- [Ultimately, dissent is actual result of the case]{.mark}

  - Ultimate result is that D was an involuntary bailee and had no duty
    to return the goods delivered by mistake, unless bailee voluntarily
    took bail or engaged in a wrongful act

<!-- -->

- **[Justice Story's three part analysis of duty of care Bailee owns a
  bailor]{.underline}**

  - Bailee = temp possessor / bailor = person who gave item up
    temporarily

  - Duty of care depends on the **purpose the bailment was created**

    - Courts are also stricter about misdelivered bailments v. damage /
      destruction of bailments

**[Servitudes]{.underline}**

- Permanent transfer of some rights

  - Permanent bailment, if you will

  - Creates **limited, durable transfers of property rights**

  - Not transferring all of property, only transferring **certain
    rights**

<!-- -->

- **Bundle of rights theory - dormant view of property, up to past 20
  years**

  - Law of rights that can be rearranged

  - Bundles can be changed, but you still have a bundle

    - Rights can be swapped, transferred, etc.

    - Transfer of part of bundle is a **servitude**

- **In rem theory of property - prominent minority in past 20 years**

  - Challenges bundle of rights conception

  - There are **restraints** on the extent to which you can transfer

    - Some parts of bundle you cannot remove

    - Some parts of bundle you cannot get rid of or else you have
      destroyed the property altogether

- **Servitudes in some circumstances run with the land**

  - This means people who didn't necessarily agree to the servitude
    might be bound by the servitude by virtue of subsequent owners
    agreeing to the servitude

  - This is what makes servitudes distinctive → **they run w/ the land**

  - They may apply to whoever owns the land, *whether or not* that
    person was involved in creating servitude in the first place or knew
    it existed

**[Two Different Types of Servitudes]{.underline}**

1)  **[Easements]{.underline}**

- Usually waivers of right to exclude

- Convey **a right for a particular use** RATHER than right to
  possession

  - Right to do a particular thing

- Eg. **a lease to possess an apartment, car, etc.**

- **Limited purpose**

- **Irrevocable**

  - They might be for a limited duration, but within duration, **you
    cannot revoke**

  - Cf. licenses, which can be revoked at any time

- Something that allows someone else to come onto your property

- [Easements always run with the land]{.mark}

  - They **always bind successors**

    - Either the successor of dominant estate gets the benefit of the
      easement

    - Or, the successor of servient estate gets the burden of the
      easemen

- Easements are durable

  - IF court awarded damages for minor encroachment in *Golden Press*,
    those damages would have purchased an easement + permitted D from
    encroaching to that extent

**[Distinctions of Easements]{.underline}**

- **[#1 Distinction]{.underline}**

  - An easement is either (never both) an **appurtenant easement or a
    easement in gross**

- **Appurtenant easement**

  - A right to use property that is someone else's

  - **Belong to a particular parcel / estate**

    - Ex: Blackacre has an appurtenant easement to go across Whiteacre's
      property to access Blackare

      - Easement benefits estate → Blackacre

      - Easement burdens another estate → Whiteacre

      - Easement is attached to both of these parcels

    - **Dominant vs. servient estates**

      - Parcel that gets the benefit = dominant estate

      - Parcel that gets burdened = servient estate

    - Owners of the estates are called **tenants**

      - Dominant + servient tenant

- **Easements in gross**

  - Easements belong to **particular persons**, not particular parcels /
    estates

  - Easements in gross **stay with the grantee**

  - There is no dominant parcel / estate in easement in gross, there is
    only a **dominant tenant**

    - Easement stays with the dominant tenant, regardless of what
      property dominant tenant owns, even if the dominant tenant does
      not own any property at all

- **[#2 Distinction]{.underline}**

  - Easements that are **affirmative**

  - Easements that are **negative**

**[Transferability of easements]{.underline}**

- [Easements in gross are *sometimes* transferable]{.mark}

  - [Most courts today do not allow transfer of **recreational easements
    in gross**]{.mark}

    - Ex: getting easement in gross to fish on pond = recreational,
      grantee cannot transfer to someone else

  - Where easements in gross are transferable is if it is **of
    commercial character**

    - Ex: billboards, utility poles, railroad tracks

      - Utility poles = easements in gross owned by the utility company

**[How to determine if there is an easement in gross or appurtenant
easement?]{.underline}**

- The **intent of parties** who created easement determines this

- If intent is unclear, court will decide **based on the circumstances**

  - If easement adds to use or enjoyment of neighboring property →
    likely **appurtenant**

  - If easement does NOT add to the use or enjoyment of neighboring
    property → in gross

- If court still cannot determine → **court generally favors finding
  appurtenant easement**

**[How to create easements]{.underline}**

1)  **Easement by grant**

    - Buying easement (parties will cut deal)

    - MUST BE IN WRITING to satisfy SOF

<!-- -->

2)  **Easement by reservation**

- Creation of an easement by one party, expressly reserving right to
  retain an easement in property that is being transferred

- I.e. you sell property but create an easement for yourself to still
  access property

3)  **Court created easements**

    - Either **by necessity or by implication**

4)  **Easement by prescription** (prescriptive easements)

5)  **Easements by estoppel**

**[Implied Easement/Easement by Implication]{.underline}**

- Easement even in the absence of a grant

- *Sometimes also called "implications for prior use"*

- Exist to protect people who are purchasing land in subdivided property
  (new subdivisions) from being surprised that no easement actually
  exists when it would have been **reasonable for them to have thought
  an easement existed**

**[Requirements for Implied Easements]{.underline}**

*Must have all!*

1)  **Necessity:** Without easement, the grantee of the property (the
    person who acquired the subdivided property) cannot enjoy the use of
    the property for the purposes to which **similar property is
    customarily devoted**

    a)  Ex: subdivision in beachfront community, want to be able to
        access beach

    b)  This definition of necessity is **broader than the requirements
        for easement by necessity**

2)  **Obvious use prior to division of parcels:** the use that would be
    permitted by the easement has to have been obviously going on
    **before** the property was separated

**[Requirements for Easement by Necessity]{.underline}**

*Must have all!*

1)  **Common ownership:** The plots were all owned by the same person
    prior to subdivision

2)  **Severed to person:** The owner of the parcels severe done portion
    by conveying it to other people

3)  **Severed portion is landlocked**: the severed portion has no access
    to the **public road**

- **[Being landlocked does not = not being able to use property for your
  own use]{.mark}**

  - *Warsaw -* not being able to use driveway for your own trucking
    purpose is not landlocked when your building is right next to the
    road

- Designed to avoid having useless parcels (i.e., parcels cut off from
  roads), [unless]{.underline} the owner is the one who cut the parcel
  off from the road

  - Isolution of parcel from road **caused by the owner** of that parcel
    having sold off another parcel bars the owner from claiming an
    easement by necessity

  - *Schwab v. Timmons*

    - P was the one who landlocked themselves by selling off another
      parcel and subdividing their property → bc P caused the isolation,
      P cannot claim easement by necessity to go across D's property

[\***[Easements by necessity always terminate when necessity
ends\*]{.underline}**]{.mark}

- [If property stops being landlocked → easement by necessity goes
  away]{.mark}

*Schwab v. Timmons*

- P owned land that dropped off onto a cliff, and land below cliff

  - P sold part of land above the cliff (next to public road) to a
    relative kept the land below

  - Land below did NOT have access to public road, so P sought easement
    to cut through an adjacent lot owned by D

- **No easement by implication**

  - The breakup of the original subdividing property was in 1854

  - There was no obvious use

**[Prescriptive Easements / Easements by Prescription]{.underline}**

- All of the following elements must be present. Use must be:

  - **1) Open + notorious**

  - **2) Continuous**

    - Continuous use w/o landowner's interference is **presumptively
      enough to show use was adverse** so long as there was no evidence
      of permission

  - **3) Adverse**

    - If license was granted → not adverse

  - **4) For statutory period of time** (usually 5 yrs in *Warsaw*)

  - **5)** in *Warsaw,* also required that definite line of travel was
    being used

    - Minor variations are okay (i.e. if truck is not driving in EXACTLY
      the same path, but they can't go all over the place)

<!-- -->

- **Policy reasoning →** law encourages property owners to do something
  about use of its property if its open and notorious, either give
  permission or stop them from using, can't just ignore it

<!-- -->

- *Warsaw v. Chicago Metallic Ceiling Inc.* 1984

  - P, who tried to buy easement by grant w/ \$ but failed, continues to
    drive on D's property for \~8 years → D interferes with P using its
    loading dock

  - Court finds P had acquired an **easement of prescription** from D
    over 25 ft. of D's property by its use of property

  - Here, court **required additional element - 5) definite line of
    travel being used**

    - Minor variations are okay, but can't be going all over the place

  - P did not have to compensate D for easement OR D knocking building
    down

    - D has to pay to demolish the building + building itself!

    - Court says **D would have gotten compensation if they built the
      building innocently**

      - Here, D started building as soon as P sued them, out of spite,
        trying to manipulate outcome

[Concurrence]{.underline}

- Also, D could have **prevented a prescriptive easement from being
  awarded to P by putting a sign up**

  - "Right to pass by permission + subject to control of owner"

  - Effectively makes any incursion be by permission granted by D

    - Recall, if permission → no prescriptive easement

  - Ex: plaques on the sidewalk, impossible to use the sidewalk for any
    other purpose than a sidewalk

    - "Permission by owner revocable at will"

**[Differences between Prescriptive Easements and Adverse
Possession]{.underline}**

- **No requirement of exclusivity**

  - many people can be using it

- **Time requirement might differ**

  - typically prescriptive easement will be shorter than statutory
    required time for AP

- **Characteristics are focused on use rights**

  - AP focuses on possession rights

**[Compensation for Easements]{.underline}**

- Common law rule is that you can get a prescriptive easement without
  compensating the property owner for it

  - However, some jurisdictions **require comp**

**[Easements by estoppel]{.underline}**

Must have all of the elements:

1)  **Permission**

    - Owner must have given someone permission to use their property in
      a [specified way]{.underline}

    - This creates a license

2)  **Reasonable expectation**

    - A reasonable person would not have expected permission to be
      revoked

3)  **Detrimental reliance**

    - The recipient of the permission must have spent \$ as a result of
      reasonably **relying on the permission**

- **In sum →** by estoppel arises when a property owners knows some
  other property owner is going to a considerable expenses in reliance
  on permission granted by the first property owner

  - If you give someone else permission to access property, knowing that
    person is going to considerable expense + reliance on that
    permission, and you DO NOT WARN THEM that you can revoke the
    permission → permission becomes **irrevocable bc it becomes an
    easement by estoppel**

<!-- -->

- *Holbrook v. Taylor*

  - P is estopped from revoking license to D to use roadway

    - P knew D was going to spend significant expense on reliance of
      road

    - P gave D limited permission to use road for construction

    - P suddenly started blocking roadway to D after D spent \$
      improving

  - **Policy reasoning →** courts want to avoid **exploitation**

- **Example of easement by estoppel**

  - A gave permission to B to go across A to get to the better road

  - B builds a garage facing A's property (bc they go to A's road) and
    built it in reliance of accessing the road next to A

  - A knew about the construction but didn't indicate he would revoke
    permission through their property

**[Affirmative / Negative Easements]{.underline}**

**Affirmative easements** allow the holder of the easement, the dominant
tenant to **do something affirmative**

- Allows them to do things that would otherwise be prohibited as a
  trespass or a nuisance on the servient parcel, such as an easement of
  access

**Negative easements** allow the holder of the easement, the dominant
tenant, to require the servient tenant **not do certain things to their
property**

- Prevents servient tenant to not do things that might harm the
  interests of the dominant tenant, things servient tenant is otherwise
  allowed to do

  - Gives the easement holder power via the easement to stop the
    servient tenant from doing something to dominant tenant (easement
    holder's) property

  - Are rare bc they are limited to 4 specific situations

  - Today, typically preventing someone from doing something on your
    property is done via a covenant, NOT a negative easement, bc
    covenants are less **restrictive**

- **Generally, negative easements are limited to 4 categories of things
  you can stop interference with:**

  - 1\) Sunlight falling on windows → *must have actual windows!*

  - 2\) Flow of air in a defined channel

  - 3\) Flow of water in an artificial channel (not a natural stream)

  - 4\) Removing lateral support to buildings

    - In some jurisdictions, you might also be able to obtain a negative
      easement to prevent someone else from blocking your view

*Fontainebleau Hotel v. 4525*

- *Sic utere* principle → use your property to the extent that your use
  doesn't harm **neighbors lawful rights**

- Here, D could not obtain negative easement to stop P from building
  structure blocking D's sunbathing area

  - Impeded light falling on sunbathing area → NOT within 4 things you
    can get a negative easement to prevent

- Structures built **partially out of spite** → okay so long as
  structure is useful

- Structures built **only due to spite with no benefit to builder other
  than enjoyment of neighbor's suffering** → NOT allowed

  - Hard to prove bc must prove something has NO use whatsoever

  - Pragmatic bc it focuses on utility, not motives

**[Termination of Easements]{.underline}**

**Straightforward way** → do so via **deed**, same idea as easement by
grant, pay for termination

**Other ways:**

- [Via merger]{.underline}

  - A grants B an easement, but B buys the parcel they bought easement
    for → easement will just disappear

    - If B sells parcel again to C, easement still does not exist, it's
      gone by merger

- [Via Adverse Possession]{.underline}

  - AP can adversely take possession of an easement → by taking
    possession of land that you had easement for

  - Eg. building a house on the path you had an easement of access for

    - Adversarially possesses the easement + thus makes easement go away

- [Via abandonment]{.underline}

  - Implied abandonment from non-use

  - Non-use itself isn't enough → non-use PLUS some **affirmative acts**
    that clearly manifest the intention to relinquish the easement

  - Discontinuation of use + affirmative act that manifests intent to
    abandon the easement

    - Ex: I have an easement to walk across edge of D's property, but
      then I build a wall so I cannot do so anymore → building wall is
      affirmative act

  - Courts generally disfavor this termination claim

- [Loss of easement through **misuse of the easement**]{.underline}

  - *Penn Bowling* - expanded use of easement is okay, but **use with
    another parcel is misuse**

    - \**Note even w/ misuse, you don't automatically lose easement*

    - *Possible to preserve easement by severing the misuse from
      easement*

- [\***[Easements by necessity always terminate when necessity
  ends\*]{.underline}**]{.mark}

  - [If property stops being landlocked → easement by necessity goes
    away]{.mark}

**[Changed circumstances generally do not create a termination of
easement]{.underline}**,

- Unless the easement was stated with a **particular purpose** that is
  **now obsolete**

  - [**\***If you no longer can use the easement for its purpose, it's
    terminated**\***]{.mark}

*Penn Bowling Recreation Center v. Hot Shoppes, Inc.* → use of easement
in connection to parcel easement was not originally granted for is
**misuse of easement**

**Facts:** Penn Bowling had received easement from Hot Shoppes; 10 years
later, Penn Bowling built a new building and continued to use easement

- D started blocking easement access, arguing easement was forfeited by
  Penn Bowling by **expanding its use** in connecting to new parcel, and
  **misused its use** by parking on easement, and did not **use it for
  the initial purpose**, which was access

  - **[P's new building blocked access to original parcel for which
    easement was originally granted]{.underline}**

  - P's use of easement also **intensified**, more trucks coming in and
    out of alleyway, more garbage

- P could get access to road via new parcel

- P's argument is its still being used for original purpose, access to
  original parcel, doesn't matter if now its also having to go through a
  building of theirs

  - Trucks might not be using easement for access, but supplies still
    are

**Holding:** expansion of use of the easement is permissible so long as
the terms of easement did not prohibit increased use, however, using the
easement on a new parcel is **impermissible**

- Mere fact they're making more **intensive use** of the easement now is
  NOT ENOUGH to constitute misuse of the easement, ASSUMING the easement
  terms didn't prohibit it

- Additional use is permissible, so long as its on the **same parcel**

  - *Some jurisdictions have reasonable person standard re: what is
    overuse*

**Remedy:** use of easement can be **temporarily enjoined** until the
burden is lifted

- Easement doesn't usually just disappear

- Whatever the misuse is, you can get temporary injunction that prevents
  use of easement UNTIL the misuse stops

  - If impossible to use it w/o misusing it, if it\'s impossible to
    sever off the increased burden that constitutes the misuse, **then
    the easement is lost altogether**

- Here, court held it *was* possible for P to stop using the easement
  with respect to Pen Bowling 2, they would have to remodel

- Whether parking was reasonable use of the easement and whether Penn
  Bowling made its own use for access impossible bc of the building →
  fact questions, tbd on remand

- Note if they moved building just a few yards onto Penn Bowling one,
  then easement wouldn't be misused! A few years is the difference here

**Policy reasoning:** Maybe court ruled in this way, as strict as it may
seem, with an intent to **decrease uncertainty,** make it more
predictable what burden of an easement is when parties are negotiating

6)  **[Covenants]{.underline}**

- Agreements that govern **what can or cannot be done** w/ respect to
  property

- About **the use** of land

- Potential subject matter covenant covers is typically broader than
  easement

  - Because it is saying what you can or cannot do, whereas easements
    are being more specific about what you can do

  - Covenants are more **flexible** than easements

- Usually covenants are something to benefit neighbors

  - *Eyerman* - there was covenant in Kingsburg place prohibiting
    building certain things → what you can and cannot build

- Both **negative** (don't do something) covenants + **positive** (do
  something) covenants exist

  - *Kramer* → racially restrictive covenant

- [[**Purely contractual**, unlike easements]{.underline}]{.mark}

  - Are ONLY created via contract

  - [MUST BE IN WRITING, SOF APPLIES]{.mark}

- 2 different types of covenants, difference in how they are enforced
  (remedy sought for breach of them is different)

  - **Real covenants** + **equitable servitudes**

    - **[\$ damages → real covenant]{.mark}**

    - **[Injunction → equitable servitude]{.mark}**

- Covenants *sometimes* run with the land

  - Covenants run with the land when they bind successors

[How to figure out if covenant runs with the land]{.underline}

(1) Which party is the burdened party and which party is the benefitted
    party?

(2) Which type of covenant is it? → **check by looking at remedy
    sought**

    (a) **If unclear, run with it and do analysis of each type**

(3) Is there a burden running, a benefit running, or both?

    (a) If both, do burden analysis first

    (b) Is horizontal privity, vertical privity, or both required?

        (i) *Note - no such thing as diagonal privity*

**Writing:** agreement between A1 + B1 (original parties who created
covenant) must be in writing

**Intent:** A1 + B1 (original parties who created covenant) must have
intended for covenant to bind successors

**Touch and concern:** *Neponsit HOA*

- Easy to satisfy

- Affects the party's disadvantages and burdens as owners of a
  particular parcels, rather than has just party of a community

  - Covenant has to affect benefits and burdens to you as the owner for
    [your specific parcel]{.underline}

    - Burdens + benefits your ownership - not specifically your physical
      land itself

- Example of what likely doesn't satisfy → dues for golf course in
  another country → value of golf course is increased by covenant, but
  value of lots is likely not affected in anyway

**Horizontal Privity**

- Must be privity of succession of estate (need not be complete
  succession)

  - Selling estate (grantor/grantee) OR renting estate (leasee/leasor)

  - Merely being neighbors **insufficient** for covenant to run with
    land (can still enter into covenant tho)

**Vertical Privity**

- Easier to establish cf. horizontal

- Any non-hostile relationship (i.e. any relationship so long as A1
  didn't acquire A2 by AP)

- **Complete succession of estate - has to be a grantor/grantee sale**

  - A2 leasing from A1 = incomplete succession, renting is no bueno

**Notice**

- Can be actual or constructive notice\*

  - *\*if in traditional jurisdiction that doesn't require actual notice
    for the burden of a real covenant\**

  - [Record notice]{.underline} → was on the records in county, was on
    deed, you should have looked

  - [Inquiry notice]{.underline} → could have found out if you inquired
    further

    - *Sanborn v. McLean* - negative covenant (burden) ran with the land

      further to see if there was a negative covenant

[Question:]{.underline} Does the burden of the covenant run from A1 to
A2?

For burden of a **real covenant** to run, the below are required:

- Agreement must be in **writing** between A1 + B1

- Original parties, A1 and B1, must have **intended to bind successors**

- Agreement must **touch + concern the land**

  - Affects parties legal relations as **landowners** (not just as
    members of the community as a whole)

- **Both** horizontal + vertical privity is needed

  - **Horizontal privity**

    - Relatively difficult to establish

    - Nexus between A1 + B1 must be a **succession of estate**

      - Selling the estate (grantor + grantee) or taking out a mortgage

      - Common form is developer subdivides property + sells parcels to
        people

    - A1 + B1 merely being **neighbors is not adequate**

      - Neighbors can enter into a covenant, but if they want one that
        runs w/ land, they are out of luck!

  - **Vertical privity**

    - Easier to satisfy than horizontal

    - **#1 Any non-hostile relationship / connection** between A1 + A2
      will do

      - Basically just means that A2 was not acquired by A1 via AP (if
        AP → no privity)

      - ANY other way A2 acquired property is good enough

    - **#2** There has to be **complete succession of the estate**, not
      succession of *part of* the estate

      - If A2 has just *leased* from A1 ≠ complete succession of estate

    - **#3** Burdened party, A2, must have **notice of the covenant**
      before they acquire the property

      - **Actual notice** or **constructive notice**

        - 2 types of constructive notice

          - **Record notice** → its in county registry, if you checked
            records you would have seen it

          - **Inquiry notice** → you didn't know, but you should have
            asked around, if you did, you would have known

      - **[Policy reasoning]{.underline}** → If A2 knew the parcel was
        burdened by a covenant, A2 would want to **price in the
        covenant** by paying less

[If both A2 and B2 are involved → **both a burden and a benefit
running**]{.underline}

- If you're in this situation, start with whether the burden runs
  analysis above, bc its harder for burdens to run then for benefits to
  run

  - If burden doesn't run, still do analysis to see if benefit runs on
    exam

*Tulk v. Moxhay* 1848 → creates equitable servitudes specifically to get
around absence of horizontal privity

- D purchases land w/ provision he would keep private garden a garden,
  but builds on it anyways

**Holding:** covenant is enforceable, despite lack of horizontal
privity, bc person acquired the property **with notice**

- Court concerned no one will want to sell land to anyone else out of
  fear the person will do something w/ the land that makes the land YOU
  retained less valuable

  - If you can't prevent someone doing something obnoxious on it, you
    might not be willing to sell the property → contrary to property law
    which wants transfer of property bc it encourages efficient use of
    land

- **Unjust enrichment** concern as well - cost of complying w/ burden
  was priced into D's purchase price

  - If someone doesn't have to have burden, D got a windfall

> → *Lee: reasoning doesn't make sense bc if burden wasn't one that
> could be enforced due to no horizontal privity, WAS it even priced
> into agreement?*

- In creating equitable servitudes, courts basically ditched horizontal
  privity requirements

*Neponsit Home Owner Association v. Emigrant Industrial Saving Banks* →
covenant to pay HOA fee "touched + concerned" land bc it provided
community benefits to owner

**Facts:** did covenant to pay HOA fee touch and concern the land?

**Holding:** yes, because covenant affected D's advantages as an owner
of the parcel

- Covenant was done for things that were done in connection with the
  land but **not actually on the land itself**

  - HOA dues were for parks / paths / roads near parcel → benefits you
    get to enjoy by virtue of owning land

- Court endorses Prof. Bigelow's famous definition of touch + concern

  - Covenant must **affect the party's advantages + burdens as owners of
    a particular parcel,** rather than just as a part of a community

- Does the covenant make owning this parcel less valuable in one way,
  but also either make owning the parcel more valuable in another way,
  OR make owning a related parcel more valuable?

- This holding is broader than stuff that just physically affects dity
  and building of property

- **Broadened definition of touch + concern - easy to satisfy**

**Remember, if neither parties in question are original parties to
agreement, you need to check if both the burden AND the benefit run**

*Sanborn v. McLean* - D had inquiry notice bc they should have
recognized uniformity of other residential-use lots + inquired to see if
covenant existed

**Facts:** D wants to build gas station on their lot. Lot had covenant
that limited lot to residential use, but the covenant wasn't on all
deeds in subdivision erroneously, including D's.

**Holding:** Covenant is binding because defendant had constructive
inquiry notice of covenant

- Entire subdivision was residential → D should have realized uniformity

- Subdivision plan as residential was repeatedly declared in deeds for
  subsequent sales of lots → covenant was repeated by others, it was
  known

- Purchasers of lots that didn't even have restriction on deed either
  complied with it

- D is only party to depart from plan in 30 years

- [Counterargument]{.underline}→ what if uniformity was accidental? How
  much inquiry did they need to do? How many deeds had this mistake? How
  many do you need to check before you've done enough?

  - Is this fair to hold purchasers accountable to covenant when they
    aren't the one that made a mistake?

**[How to get rid of covenants]{.underline}**

- Negotiate the covenant away

- Abandonment

- Change of circumstances

*Bolotin v. Rindge* 1964

**Facts:** P had lot with covenant to limit lots in subdivision to
single family residences. P wanted to build commercial building on his
lot before covenant expired and argued the circumstances had changed,
best use of lot was commercial, lot was unsuitable for single family
residences, and commercial build would have no adverse effect on market
value or amenities of neighbors (only bring commercial use 100 feet
closer than already exists). D argued traffic would negatively impact
home value in subdivision.

**[Requirements for change of circumstances to deem covenant
unenforceable]{.underline}**

If EITHER of the following are true:

Changed conditions have rendered the restrictions' purposes obsolete

- NOT TRUE HERE, people who didn't want office building did own
  residential property there

**[OR]{.underline}**

Enforcement would be inequitable, would harass burden party, AND would
not benefit adjoining land owners

- Have to ask is if the neighbors would LOSE any benefit → would they
  have less pleasant residential neighborhood?

- [Court -- important to distinguish between effect on market value
  (trial courts finding) and comfort and enjoyment of neighbors, which
  is what matters]{.mark}

**[Why Is Changed Circumstances Doctrine Useful?]{.underline}**

Developer might have made wrong predictions about what future would look
like

- D might have thought it should have been residential property, but
  maybe that was just wrong

- Or, there are many parties to the covenant, so negotiating termination
  would be impossible, last will try + hold out

*Peckham v. Milroy* → abandonment of covenant when covenant is
habitually + substantially violated

**Facts:** D ran daycare against covenant banning commercial use in
subdivision. D argued covenant was abandoned because other residents had
commercial businesses in subdivision.

**Holding:** Abandonment allowed when covenant **habitually and
substantially violated**

[Requirement to for violations of covenant to constitute abandonment of
covenant]{.underline}

**#1 -** Violations have eroded the general plan

**#2 -** Violations must have been habitual and substantial

- There were violations, but a small amount compared to total lots

**#3 -** Violations make enforcement inequitable

**[Criticism of termination by abandonment doctrine]{.underline}**

Even if violations are habitual + substantial, is it fair to then say
abandonment has occurred and no one is bound by this?

- If no one was wearing a mask, would we say bc of that, no one should?

- Shouldn't poor people who are obeying + getting screwed over by the
  jerks that aren't listening be considered?

On the other hand, if we DON'T allow abandonment, are we giving too much
power to minority to hold out with society and prevent efficient +
beneficial use of land

**[Nuisance]{.underline}**

- Limited by principle sic utere - use what's yours, do whatever you
  want, SO LONG as to not harm others others

- But this principle doesn't prohibit ALL injuries to others

  - Prohibiting all injuries to others would be unenforceable, and some
    benefits come inherently w/ injuries

    - Ex: rule you can't inadvertently jostle you on subway

      - You can be protected... but not have the subway

- Other people are compensated by all the advantages of civilized
  society

  - Want the benefit of the city, you have to deal with the smoke,
    odors, noise

- [Landowners must make **reasonable use** so as to not occasion any
  **unnecessary damage or annoyance to his neighbor**]{.mark}

  - You aren't prohibited from doing ANY annoyance or harmful use, but
    you're limited to reasonable use, that doesn't cause **unnecessary
    damage or annoyance**

[What is reasonable depends on **circumstances**]{.underline}

- **Locality rule** → use of property in one locality, under some
  circumstances may be lawful and reasonable, but inappropriate in
  another neighborhood

  - Is the use **appropriate to the neighborhood** or not?

  - "nuisance may merely be a right thing in a wrong place"

**Rule:** To constitute a nuisance, the use must be such as to produce a
**tangible and appreciable injury** to neighboring property, [or an
injury that renders enjoyment of the property **specially uncomfortable
or inconvenient**]{.mark}

- **Specially = diff than is ordinary in neighborhood, related to
  locality rule**

  - Eg on the train, someone punches you

- **Injury has to be significant / substantial**

**[Defenses to nuisance]{.underline}**

["Coming to the nuisance" defense]{.underline} *in some jurisdictions +
handled diff juri to juri*

- If plaintiff showed up on scene **after** objectionable activity had
  already started, [[he came to the nuisance]{.underline}]{.mark}

- Whichever conflicting use comes later, loses - earlier use has
  priority

  - If factory comes after house, bad news for factory

- Court here (and many other jurisdictions) rejects this theory → would
  allow factory to control, essentially, what happens on other people's
  property

- \...But same thing is true other way, house is also controlling what
  the factory can do

  - Aren't both people causing a nuisance, in some way?

  - Controversial defense

  - Another issue is this can encourage wasteful races to be "first" to
    use it in your obnoxious way

  - → because of the above, **courts are reluctant to recognize this
    defense**

  - [When unclear who showed up first, court balances factors like who
    got there first, good faith, spite, public interest/benefit to
    public, promissory estoppel/detrimental reliance, etc.]{.mark}

[Estoppel/acquiescence]{.underline}

- Should have said something before you invested, now you can't complain

  - Don't apply here because P invested before he knew D was burning
    bricks, so D's use wasn't priced into P's purchase

[Prescriptive easement]{.underline}

- PEs can allow someone to commit a nuisance

  - Here, D did not have a PE - one requirement of PE is continuity and
    here, there was not 20 yrs of continuous use (some years he didn't
    burn bricks)

**[Remedies for nuisance]{.underline}**

- **Injunctive relief applies to:**

  - **Avoid interminable litigation** or **multiplicity of suits**

    - e.g. gas everywhere would have been recurring, want to avoid other
      people bringing same claim

  - **Or avoid irreparable injury** (injury not remedied by \$ damages)

- If either situation above applies, you still must **balance the
  hardships/equities**

  - [Injunctions can still be denied on the basis of **balance of
    hardships**]{.mark}

  - [I[f the injunction would be excessively burdensome on the
    defendant, in light of a relatively small benefit to the plaintiff,
    might **not get injunction**]{.underline}]{.mark}

  - Must look at potential harm to society if injunction is not granted

    - Look at harm to society if D were to get an injunction/P were not
      to get an injunction

**[Anticipated nuisances do not have a COA because there isn't actual
interference yet]{.underline}**

*Campbell v. Seaman* 1876

**Facts:** P buys property + builds house on it when D is not burning
bricks in adjacent property; D resumes burning bricks, which causes
toxic gas to ruin P's extensive landscaping

**Holding:** D is liable for nuisance bc gas goes from D onto P's
property frequently enough "that some injury is to be expected."

- P has right to enjoy his land + landscaping, **injunction** is an
  appropriate remedy to preserve P's interests moving forward (P can
  replant trees!)

- D didn't have any defenses; P cannot be estopped bc P didn't buy or
  build knowing D would burn bricks, and no PE bc no continuous use

**[Trespass & Difference w/ Nuisance]{.underline}**

*Adams v. Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co.* → dust + vibrations that interfere
with owner's use + enjoyment of land = nuisance, not trespass bc no
**significant, physical intrusion**

- How to determine if a particular conflict is a trespass or a nuisance

- D operated iron mine and expanded mine 3x (1 time of which may have
  been after P had moved there)

- P lived in nearby town + sued for BOTH trespass + nuisance

  - Argued mine generated dust, noise, vibrations which resulted in P
    clean the house all the time, replace cracks, windows, plumbing
    breaks and leaks, psychological harms in form of nervousness and
    sleeplessness, and diminished home value, so much that they couldn't
    sell it

- **No trespass** bc noise + vibrations are not tangible, and dust is
  not a significant enough physical intrusion

[Requirements for trespass]{.underline}

- Invasion of your property that is both

  - Done by **physical, tangible object**

  - Invasion is **direct** (ct claims to liberalize formality of
    directness rule)

    - No intervening force caused thing to go onto property (like wind)

    - "Occurs by some means that **D had knowledge to substantial
      certainty**, or should have known, was going to cause a physical
      invasion"

- Recall per *Jacque v. Stenberg Homes*, you get nominal damages for
  trespass, even w/o any damage at all

[Requirements for nuisance]{.underline} (one approach, not same one as
*Campbell* or *Jacque*, its a different approach)

- Have to pass **balancing test based on social value of the activity**

  - How beneficial is activity?

  - How harmful is activity?

  - Do we care about these benefits + harms?

  - Is society better off with harm + benefit, and no harm but no
    benefit?

- To get damages, you have to prove there's **actual + substantial
  injury**

4 standard tests to tell diff between nuisance and trespass

*some jurisdictions use, one, combination of some, all of them*

- Was defendants act on plaintiff\'s land or was defendant's act
  elsewhere?

  - Trespass v. nuisance

- Was harm of D's activity direct or indirect?

  - Trespass v. nuisance

- Was invasion by tangible matter or intangible?

  - Trespass v. nuisance

  - Are invading items **individually visible to naked eye?**

- Did P lose possession, or merely enjoyment of property?

  - Trespass v. nuisance

**[Calabresi & Melamed: "Cathedral Paper"]{.underline}**

- Court must decide not only which side to favor, but whom to entitle,
  which entitlements are protected, whether an individual is allowed to
  sell or trade the entitlement, the kind of protection to grant

- Three types of entitlements:

  - [Property]{.underline}

    - An entitlement is protected by a property rule to the extent that
      someone who wishes to remove the entitlement from its holder must
      buy it from him in a voluntary transaction in which the value is
      agreed upon by the seller

    - Least amount of state intervention

- [Liability]{.underline}

  - Whenever someone may destroy the initial entitlement if he is
    willing to pay an objectively determined value for it

  - The value may be what it is thought the original holder of the
    entitlement would have sold it for

  - Additional stage of state intervention -- not only are entitlements
    protected, but their transfer or destruction is allowed on the basis
    of a value determined by [some organ of the state rather than the
    parties themselves]{.underline}

- [Inalienable]{.underline}

  - Transfer is not permitted between a willing buyer and a willing
    seller

  - The state not only determined who is entitled and to determine
    compensation is the entitlement is taken away or destroyed, but also
    to forbid its sale under certain or all circumstances

  - Limits or regulates the grant of the entitlement itself

  - Most entitlements to most goods are mixed

- How is price determined?

  - By the person who holds the entitlement (property)

    - Better when transaction costs are low

  - Someone else (liability) -- court sets price to defendant to
    compensate plaintiff

    - May be better when transaction costs are high

- Most scholarship that follows Calabresi have assumed that property
  rule protection means mandatory relief (an injunction or no liability)
  and liability rule means payment of monetary compensation, but the
  textbook authors see this as an oversimplification.

- Property rule -- cannot be taken without holder's consent

- Liability rule -- can be taken by what amounts to a forced sale

- Common starting point in literature discussing this is that **courts
  have a choice** regarding if property or liability and the assignment
  of the entitlement to the plaintiff or defendant

  - **[Property Rule:]{.underline}** the price of the entitlement is
    determined by the parties and the entitlement is given voluntarily →
    injunction

    - P gets the entitlement -- *Campbell v. Seaman*

    - D gets the entitlement -- *Hinman v. Pacific Air*

  - **[Liability Rule:]{.underline}** the price of the entitlement is
    determined and given by someone else (usually a court) money damages
    (usually according to fair market value)

    - P gets the entitlement and liability rule protection, however is
      required to accept money damages in exchange for dealing with
      nuisance - *Boomer v. Atlantic Cement*

    - D gets the entitlement -- *Spur v. Webb*

- When there are many plaintiffs as part of one party -- *Boomer v.
  Atlantic Cement*

  - Too costly to negotiate with each P (assembly problem)

  - Each P has an inventive to hold out and ask the other party for
    money (hold out problem)

→ the most economical solution is to (1) hold for P and (2) protect
entitlement with liability rule (solves both the assembly problem and
hold out problem)

- **Inalienable Entitlement:** transfer isn't allowed at all

**[Three factors as to assigning initial entitlement:]{.underline}**

- Economic efficiency

- Distributional preferences

- Other justice considerations

  - If **transaction costs are high**, there may be circumstances in
    which shifting to liability is preferred on efficiency grounds

- Another argument here is that courts may have more limited information
  than the parties about the benefits and costs of allocating
  entitlements

[Property Rule]{.underline} -- entitlement is protected by a property
rule when it cannot be taken without the holder's consent; protection
against trespassers

[Liability Rule]{.underline} (\$ damages) -- entitlement is protected by
liability rule when it can be taken by what amounts to a forced sale

> To protect the entitlement with a property rule or a liability rule,
> must address three factors:

- Economic efficiency

- Distributional preferences

- Other justice considerations

*Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.* → liability rule w/ P entitlement -
cement plant dust

**Facts:** D's cement plant spews dust, smoke, and vibration. P sues for
nuisance and wins. Injunction was denied but temporary damages allowed.

**Issue:** Could single recovery be had, w/o court issuing permanent
injunction?

[Three options]{.underline}

1\) Issue an injunction

2\) Issue an injunction but delay injunction until technology/industry
advances to not cause nuisance to residents

3\) payment of damages to plaintiff (Rule 2)

- Court applies balancing test, balancing effects of granting / denying
  injunction

  - Here, significant harm to plant for shutting down, esp. In
    comparison to P's harm, which is relatively small in comparison

  - Injunction would be costly

    - D would have to get permission from all Ps → **hold-out problem &
      assembly problem**

**Holding:** P get liability rule protection (has entitlement bc
nuisance)

- P is required to accept \$ damages in exchange for **dealing with**
  the nuisance → special type of injunction, where you can pay \$
  damages to not obey injunction

- Result gives factory an easement to continue polluting

  - By paying damages, factory now has entitlement to commit the
    nuisance, a the cost of the damages

- Court should focus on 2 parties before it rather than considering
  policy implications → not courts job to do that

**Dissent:** pollution is bad, we should stop it

**[Zoning]{.underline}**

- Similar to covenants, but typically broader scale and **done by the
  government**

  - Zoning is done by law (ordinances)

**[Two ways to potentially avoid zoning regulations]{.underline}**

- Seek a special exception → written within ordinance itself

- Request for variance

  - Variance = exception due to hardship, given on case by case basis

*Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.* → zoning ordinance is
constitutional bc its justified for public welfare

**Facts:** Village had 6 difference use zones; each zone was assigned
certain activities and organized together ("good" zones, single family
homes, parks + less favorable zones, cemeteries) → **use zoning**

- **[Cumulative zoning:]{.underline}** area zoned for particular use,
  permissible to engage in that use, in addition to any use that is less
  intensive (i.e., more pleasant)

  - You can build duplex in U2-U6, aka anywhere that allows more
    intensive use

![](media/image9.png){width="6.5in" height="3.6944444444444446in"}

- P's land had different portions of the use zones on it + result was P
  could not build commercially + thus value of land was significantly
  decreased bc no one would want to buy it

  - P argued ordinance violated P's DP rights

**Holding:** A legislative zoning classification will survive
constitutional scrutiny as long as the classification is "fairly
debatable."

- Will be constitutional unless it is "clearly arbitrary + unreasonable,
  having no substantial relation of public health, safety, morals,
  general welfare, etc."

  - Here, D found justification of ordinance in some aspect of D's
    police power → **public welfare**

    - Excluding industry, apartments in single-family home are makes
      sense, preserve neighborhood, don't want "parasitic" apartments +
      shops in residential neighborhood

**[Terminology]{.underline}**

- **Non-conforming uses:** uses that **pre-existed prior to zoning**,
  but do not conform after zoning, are grandfathered in + allowed to
  remain

  - Even if lot existed prior to zoning, you cannot build something on
    it after zoning and call it a non-conforming use → building itself
    had to exist + be in use prior to zoning

  - Also cannot swap uses if you are a non-confirming use

    - Can't swap over to being a school, for ex

- **Amortization:** *some*, not all, jurisdictions, use amortization to
  phase out non-conforming use after a specified period of time

  - You can keep doing what you're doing, but, you have to stop doing
    it + comply with zoning ordinance in X \# number of years

**[Exclusionary Zoning]{.underline}**

- Earliest zoning targeted characteristics of **users** rather than
  **uses**

  - Enforced economic + residential segregation

- This is now unconstitutional

*Southern Burlington County NAACP v Township of Mount Laurel* -- low and
moderate income families excluded from municipality

- Note doctrinally, this case is complete outlier

**Facts:** City protected tax base by forcing developers who had 3
school age children in a multi-family home to pay public school fees →
result is low + middle income people can't live in the area

**Holding:** Zoning as an action under the police power must p**romote
the general welfare** and **cannot be motivated by other
considerations** such as minimizing the local property tax rate

- City has presumptive obligation to not make housing impossible for
  low + middle income people

- *Lee: Is* this best addressed using zoning law, and not taxing
  employers + giving vouchers to low-income people to housing?

**[Ellickson hates zoning]{.underline}**

- All you need is nuisance law + private covenants

- Yes, you need court to keep eye on covenants, but this will work

**[Criticisms of zoning]{.underline}**

- **Rent seeking →** if gov is giving benefits, this incentives people
  to lobby to the government

  - *Note rent here is "economic rent", political power, not actual
    rent*

  - Those that have power political power + influence are more likely to
    benefit from zoning

- **Regulatory/legislative capture →** gov regulatory entities can be
  "captured", influenced, by the very organizations they regulate

**[Private ordering is also problematic]{.underline}**

- People are going to scheme for the best economic benefit they can get,
  esp the evil rich people in power

**[Dividing Ownership Across People & Time]{.underline}**

**[Overview of Present & Future Interests]{.underline}**

**[Estate:]{.underline}** property rights defined in terms of their
duration through time

- Temporal measure of a property right

![](media/image10.png){width="6.5in" height="4.75in"}

**Present Possessory Interests**

**[Fee Simple Absolute]{.underline}**

- **Largest** package of property rights you can have - everything else
  is less

- If transferring property + don't specify otherwise, it is presumed you
  are transferring a fee simple absolute

- Indefinite, runs to infinity

- Granted by language such as "I grant Black Acre **to Jones."**

  - As long as you are alive, you may have heirs apparent (not just
    "heirs" until you're dead)

    - Heirs "apparent" bc you might change mind about who's your heir

      - Eg. "to Jones and his heirs" just means to Jones bc Jones is
        alive + thus has no heirs

  - Fees simple absolute → plural version

**[Life Estate]{.underline}**

- Interest that gives you a right to possess the property, but right
  terminates automatically upon death of named person

  - Estate exists as long as certain person is alive

  - Can be transferred → alienable by gift or by sale

    - Life estate pur autre vie → life estate that's measured by the
      life of somebody OTHER than the person who holds it

      - Estate will be measured by original holder's life

**[Complete succession of estate for vertical privity in
covenants]{.underline}**

- If A1 owns Black Acre in fee simple Absolute, and transfers life
  estate to A2, that is NOT complete succession of estate, bc life
  estate doesn't last as long as the fee simple absolute (which is...
  FOREVA!)

  - It's only partial succession of estate

**Defeasible fees**

- Allow ownership to change if some specified event occurs

  - But whether event will actually occur or not is uncertain → might
    happen, might not

  - If it does happen, estate is terminated / if it doesn't happen,
    estate is not terminated

- This is in contrast to a life estate, which inevitably always ends,
  they will always terminate

- Defeasible fees → might not terminate, you don't know

- Many states statutes require defeasible fees be **limited in their
  duration**, that it be 30 yrs or so, after that, they're just locked
  in

[Three types of defeasible fees]{.underline}

- These enable people to make 2 choices: who gets the possession
  interest, original grantor or someone else? Does this transfer occur
  automatically, or can the recipient decide whether to accept the
  thing?

  - If an event happens, who gets it, and does the transfer happen
    automatically or at discretion of the other party? → answer to these
    Qs determines which sort of defeasible fee you want to create

**#1 Fee simple determinable**

- Ends automatically if a named event occurs

- Created using **durational language** - language of time

  - As long as, while, until

- If conditional event occurs, interest automatically goes back to
  original grantor

**#2 Fee simple subject to a condition subsequent**

- Continues indefinitely until a named event occurs

- But if named event occurs, **IT DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY END**

- Original grantor can choose to end it via self-help or law

- Created by **conditional language**

  - But if , On condition if, If

  - Set off by commas

- Eg. "To Meghan Markle, but if you ever become part of a foreign royal
  family, then the grantor has a right to re Enter and retake the
  property"

**#3 Fee simple subject to executory limitation**

- If triggering event occurs, the possessor right DOES NOT go back to
  the original grantor; instead it goes to some third party

- Durational or conditional language

- Eg. "To Chelsea, but if she ever appears on a reality TV show, then to
  Ivanka."

  - Difference between condition subsequent + executory limitation is
    that it's going to a **third party**

- Appears to works automatically → not a thing where 3rd party has a
  choice to take it or not

- No 3rd party discretionary analog (aka they can't refuse it, have to
  take it)

**Corresponding Future Interests**

**[Reversionary (I.e., in grantor)]{.underline}**

- Interests in the original grantor, the person who created this whole
  thing in the first place

<!-- -->

- NEVER situation where NO ONE has possessory interest → someone can
  always take

  - Even if there's a grant that doesn't explicitly who can take at any
    given time and looks like a gap, there's someone implicitly that can
    take

<!-- -->

- No revisionary for fee simple absolute (lasts until end of time)

<!-- -->

- Life estate → Reversion

  - If grant to A for life, when A dies, life estate goes back to
    original grantor

    - OG then has a reversion

<!-- -->

- Fee simple determinable -- possibility of reverter

  - Follows every single fee simple determinable, and only single fee
    simple determinable

  - Nothing that isn\'t a fee simple determinable has a possibility of
    reverter

    - Unique: fee simple determinable & possibility of reverter

  - Returns possession to the grantor w/ possibility of reverter

    - FSD in offeree and possibility of reverter, implicity, in offeror

  - Possibility of reverter is **automatic** - it happens if triggering
    event occurs

    - Implicit if fee simple determinable doesn't say what happens
      exactly if event occurs

      - "I will do X as long as there's a train station on 14th St."

      - Durational language creates fee simple determinable

- AP clock can start to run if the holder of fee simple determinable,
  who should vacate once triggering event occurs, but doesn't

- Fee simple subject to a condition subsequent → right of entry (power
  of termination)

  - Goes back to original grantor → right of entry, or power of
    termination

    - Gives OG the **right, but not the obligation** to retake

      - [Note latches may bar exercising this right if OG waits too
        long!]{.mark}

      - If you're going to exercise your right of entry, then you need
        to do so within a reasonable time after getting the right

    - OG can choose to let former possessor stay there

- Fee simple subject to executory limitation → no reversionary interest
  bc whole point of this is that the right goes to the other person

**[In Other People]{.underline}**

- **Fee simple absolute →** none bc lasts for lifetime

- **Life estate →** future interest, if there is one, is a remainder

  - Eg. grant to A for life, then to B → B is not OG, doesn't have
    reversion, but has a **remainder**

  - Remainders can be any form of these present possessory interests

    - Eg. since no qualification on B's remainder interest, it's just a
      remainder in fee simple absolute

    - Eg. if to A for life, then to B for life → B has remainder in life
      estate to B

- **Fee simple determinable** → no right in other people, if triggering
  event occurs, goes back to OG

- **Fee simple subject to a condition subsequent** → no right in other
  people, if triggering event occurs, goes back to OG

- **Fee simple subject to executory limitation** → executory interest

  - Future interest correspondent goes to other people if the triggering
    event occurs

**[Examples/hypos]{.underline}**

"To A for life, then to B and his heirs"

- creates a life estate in A and B has a remainder in fee simple
  absolute (or fee simple, same thing)

If C comes in adversely, and APs the land, C will assume possession
until the end of A's life

- C has a life estate por otra vez → lasts for as long as A's life - NOT
  C's life

  - Remember - whatever the person can AP is what the other party has
    and nothing more bc of nemo dat, so C can only have/adversely
    possess what A has

B still has a **remainder** in fee simple absolute

- After A dies, B would have the remainder

At this point, A has nothing because B has the remainder

A's life estate was adversely possessed by C, but once A dies, C is
trespassing on B - NOT adversely possessing

- If C meets the requirements for AP (remember, clock restarts again)
  then yes, he will AP it again - but C CANNOT restart the clock until B
  actually has the present possessory interest, bc otherwise there's
  nothing for C to AP

- O grants Blackacre to Huxley College **as l[ong]{.underline} as**

  - Huxley College has a fee simple determinable bc this is a
    contingency with **durational language**

    - "As long as"

    - Cf. a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent that uses
      **conditional language** → "but if," "on condition that",

- O grants Blackacre to A, **[but if]{.underline}** marijuana is inhaled
  on the premises, then O **shall have a right** to re-enter and take
  the promises

  - A has a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent bc it uses
    conditional language and also, O has a right to re-enter and take
    the premises

  - O has a reversionary interest → a right of entry (or power of
    termination)

- O conveys Blackacre to A for life, then to B for life, then to C.

  - A has a life estate

  - B has a remainder in life estate

  - C has a remainder in fee simple absolute

- O grants Blackacre to A for life, then to B for life, then to B's
  children who survive B.

  - A has a life estate

  - B has a remainder in life estate

    - *Recall, a life estate can't be followed by a life estate, it has
      to be a **remainder** in life estate, otherwise B would be able to
      on the property when A is still living + possesses it*

  - B's children have a remainder in fee simple absolute

  - O has an implied reversion in life estate

    - Suppose B has 2 children and they both die before B does → then, B
      has remainder in life estate → when B dies, the property would
      have gone to B's children, but they are dead

  - [Someone always has to be able to take - it can't go to no
    one]{.mark}

  - [Therefore, there is an **implicit reversion back to O**]{.mark}

  - [Remember, if the future interest is in the grantor, then it is a
    **reversion** - if it\'s to someone else, it\'s a remainder]{.mark}

    - Because of this possibility, there is an implicit reversion back
      to O

    - This reversion goes away if one of B's children survives B

    - If O is not alive at that point - it goes to O's estate

[How to keep property in the family]{.underline}

- Note if grandfather gave the properties to his children as fee simple
  instead of as a life estate with a remainder in each life tenants
  issue (grandkids), then the children could have sold it to anybody,
  instead of definitely giving it to their own children (grandkids)

- Life estates with remainders in their kids ensures for at least 1
  generation, the property stays in the family

- Grandkids can sell bc they have remainder in fee simple absolute

**[Waste]{.underline}**

- The ability to divide property rights across time gives rise to the
  possibility of **conflicts across time**

- Person who holds a remainder = remainderman

- Holder of life estate might take action that the remainderman, the
  people who might come to possess the property later, might not like

**[Problem of divergence of interests]{.underline}**

- Eg. chopping down trees that take a long time to grow!

<!-- -->

- Law tries to mitigate the divergence of interests with the **doctrine
  of waste**

  - [This is the default rule, basic rule law applies unless relevant
    rights holders agree to do something else]{.mark}

    - [E.g. if the right holders all agreed to remove the trees]{.mark}

**Types of Waste**

[Affirmative waste]{.underline}

- Person w/ present possessory interest is doing something **bad**

  - Not normal use, rather, **use that causes excess damage**

  - Use that causes normal wear and tear is NOT affirmative waste

    - Eg. Chopping down ornamental trees; this isn't just normal wear
      and tear, this is not normal, bad

[Permissive waste]{.underline}

- Person w/ present possessory interest DOESN'T act

- **Unreasonable failure to act** which causes **excess damage**

  - Eg. roof starts leaking but person doesn't fix roof - they didn't do
    anything when they should have acted to prevent excess damage in the
    form of water damage

[Ameliorative waste]{.underline}

- Significant change in the property

- Although its a change, unlike the other 2 changes in affirmative in
  permissive waste, this change **increases the value of the property**,
  changes the property in a way that makes the property "better"

  - Typically "better" = increases market valuable

- Today, this waste *can be allowed*, if there are **changed
  circumstances**

  - You can do ameliorative waste sometimes, not always

*Brokaw v. Fairchild* 1929 → ameliorative waste, even though it makes
property value better, can still be form of waste / life tenant has
right to use estate, but NOT right to act like owner / knocking building
down is acting like owner

**Facts:** P, a remainderman, had inherited a mansion from his father
and wanted to knock the mansion down and build apartments, claiming he
couldn't rent the mansion for enough to cover the tax bill. The other
remaindermen who also inherited mansions located nearby objected and
argue knocking the mansion down is waste.

**Holding:** If you have a life estate, you do not own the property,
cannot act like an owner, and must pass the property to remainderman in
similar condition. Thus, P cannot knock the mansion down because to do
so is wasteful.

- Demolishing property = act of ownership

- The property must pass to the remainderman "as nearly as practicable,
  unimpaired in its nature, character, or improvements," otherwise, it's
  waste

<!-- -->

- If you have a life estate, you can just use the estate, but you can't
  impair what it is that is handed down on to the remainderman

- Doesn't matter if the remaindermen would or would not be financially
  better off

  - **Not all values can be reduced to monetary values**

    - Even if everyone would be better off financially, doesn't mean
      they'd be better off all things considered

    - They may have lost irreparable sentimental value

- Same idea as in *Bolotin v. Rindge* - just looking at market value of
  property is not enough, must consider other aspects of property
  outside of market value that are important to people

**[Restraints on alienation]{.underline}**

- Transferability of property can be **socially beneficial**

  - Allows allocation of resources to the highest valuing users

  - Promotes owner autonomy, allows people to decide who gets property
    next

- [[Absolute restraints on alienation are void as against public
  policy]{.underline}]{.mark}

  - Exception → courts typically will uphold **limited** restraints on
    alienation, so long as restraints are **reasonably related** to some
    family estate planning objective

    - For eg., not allowing a minor to alienate property until minor has
      reached adult age

  - Exception → there are absolute restraints of alienation the **law
    itself imposes**

    - Eg. Inalienable entitlements by law → body parts + bodies

*Odd Fellows v. Toscano* → restrictions on use of land are okay,
restriction on users of land are void as a **limitation on alienation**

**Facts:** D granted lot to P as a gift to operate lodge on, provided
lot would revert back to D if either the lodge sold, any part of the lot
was transferred, or if P stopped using the lot for lodge purposes.

**Holding:** The limitation on the grant that the interest would revert
back to the grantor if the lodge was sold or if the lodge transferred
the lot is an **invalid absolute restraint on alienation**

- Provision that D gets it back if P stops using it for lodge purposes,
  however, is valid restraint on alienation

  - Restriction is valid bc it is a **restriction on use**, even though
    has the effect of restricting eligible users only to the lodge
    itself

    - Restriction on use = ok

    - Restriction on user = not ok

- Restriction on use is a **valid fee simple subject to a condition
  subsequent**

**Dissent:** If effect of the two restrictions is identical, they should
be treated as identical and thus both provisions should be invalid as
absolute restraints on alienation.

- Generally, in cases in which **language is ambiguous** as to whether
  it creates a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to
  condition subsequent, courts tend to favor the **fee simple subject to
  condition subsequent b**ecause it will avoid automatic forfeiture

[Potential issue with any defeasible fee that doesn't have a time limit
on it]{.underline} → fragmented ownership could result and all
fragmented owners will have to agree to a deal

- Reversionary interests might pop up in the future

- For eg., lodge uses lot for something other than lodge → lot reverts
  back to OG → if OGs are dead, to OGs kids, but if kids are dead,
  grandchildren might be dead → great grandkids each own a small bit of
  the property and have to agree to a deal amongst each other

- Several jurisdictions place time limits on defeasible fees, like 30
  yrs

**[Concurrent Ownership Interests]{.underline}**

**[Possible to have multiple owners at the same time -
"co-tenancies"/concurrent interests]{.underline}**

- Could grant to A for life, then to B **and** C

  - A gets a life estate

  - B and C **together** have a remainder in fee simple

- Also possible for A to own property in fee simple, while B
  simultaneously has a life estate in the property

  - During B's lifetime, there are shared property rights but once B
    dies, it's all A's

**[Popular alternatives to these types of co-tenancies]{.underline}**

- Trusts, corporations, business partnerships → multiple ppl having
  property interest in a single thing

**[Four basic types of concurrent interests]{.underline}**

1)  **Tenancy in Common**

- Each tenant is an owner

- Each tenant in common has an undivided interest in the property

  - [[Each has the right to possess the whole]{.underline}]{.mark}

    - Eg if Jack + Jill own a house as tenants in common, Jack cannot
      exclude Jill from the living room, Jack cannot exclude Jill from
      the kitchen, etc.

  - \...But, these interests are **separate**

    - Each interest is thus **independently alienable**

      - Jack can sell his interest w/o getting Jill's permission - each
        interest is separate and thus each owner can transfer it to
        whoever he wishes

  - Share sizes do NOT need to be equal

    - Co-tenants may have unequal rights to profits or to rents from the
      property

    - Co-tenants may have unequal responsibilities/obligations

  - [Co-tenants do not have any property rights against each
    other]{.mark}

  - No co-tenant can demand rent from another co-tenant

2)  **Joint Tenancy**

- Similar as tenancy in common w/ 3 major differences

  - **[#1 Joint tenancy has a right of survivorship]{.underline}**

    - When one joint tenant dies, his interest vanishes, and any other
      joint tenant's interest increases proportionately

      - Survivors have a right to the deceased tenants share

      - Rationale → if one interest vanishes, you don't want gap in
        interest, someone has to always have an interest

  - This is true REGARDLESS of wills

    - Another hypo - [if Blackacre is owned by 3 tenants, A, B, C who
      all have equal shares, and A dies, B and C would each own a half
      of Blackacre]{.mark} - this is true **regardless** of what A's
      will said

  - Implication → don't want to enter into joint tenancy unless you
    trust the joint tenants

  - **[#2 Joint tenancy requires satisfying the "four
    unities"]{.underline}**

    - [*Unity of possession* - each joint tenant must have an EQUAL
      right to possess the whole (same as tenancy in common)]{.mark}

    - *Unity of time* - each joint tenants interest must have been
      established at the same time

    - *Unity of title -* each tenant got their title (ownership share)
      via the same instrument

      - AP can be the same instrument (its possible, doesn't just need
        to be via deed)

    - *Unity of interest* - they must all have a fee simple, or a life
      estate, or a lease

      - The interest has to be the same type for all joint tenants

    - Some states have relaxed time + title requirement bc it\'s easy to
      get around via a straw transaction anyways

  - **[#3 Joint tenants share sizes must be the same]{.underline}**

    - Each tenant must have the same size shares

      - *In minority of states, you don't need to have shares same size*

      - *Note if exam says something is a "properly formed joint
        tenancy" , you assume that it is and move on. Don't try and
        challenge the asusmptions/facts given in fact pattern*

[[Below 2 are for marital property only]{.underline}]{.mark}

3)  **Tenancy by the Entirety**

- *Exists in a number of states, but not all*

- Holdover from the fact that under the common law, for many centuries,
  married women were not allowed to own property in their own name

- Similar to joint tenancy - has a right of survivorship, requires
  satisfying the four unities to create

  - **[Fifth unity -]{.underline}** have to be married to have it

- Marriage is a unit, property belongs to the unit → **key difference is
  neither spouse can unilaterally transfer property that's held by the
  tenancy by the entirety or by incumbent** (can't take mortgage out
  against it)

  - They can transfer property **ONLY IF** the other spouse agrees

  - Both spouse must agree to any transfer the interest or incumbent

- Can't get out of a tenancy by the entirely unilaterally

  - Have to get other spouse to agree OR get divorced → only way to get
    out of tenancy by the entirety

4)  **Community Property**

- Alternative to tenancy by the entirety → state has one or the other,
  but not both

- All property acquired in a marriage automatically becomes community
  property, regardless of which spouse acquired it

  - Equal right to possess community property

  - Alienation or encumbrance of community property requires consent of
    both spouses

- If spouses divorce, community property is divided equally 50/50,
  unless spouse can show it was separate property (which means it\'s not
  governed by community property)

[Both tenancy by the entirety + community property require permission
from other spouse to transfer property, but difference is that in
community property after divorce, all property is divided
equally]{.underline}

**[Hypo]{.underline}**

Grant gives blackacre to A and B.

- [Assuming they're not married they are either a tenancy in common or
  joint tenancy]{.mark}

  - [Without further specification, it is **presumed it is a tenancy in
    common**]{.mark}

  - [Presumption is that it is a tenancy in common]{.mark}

**[Resolving Disputes Amongst Co-Owners]{.underline}**

- **Future Interest Disputes** → doctrine of waste will step in to place
  restrictions on what present owner can do (or in permissive waste,
  should be doing) to protect co-owners long term property interests

- **Concurrent Owner Disputes →** court generally won't intervene; waste
  is generally disfavored as remedy for concurrent owner disputes

  - **[Remedy is partition]{.underline}**

    - If you don't like relationship, you can get out of it

<!-- -->

- [Co-tenants in tenancy in common OR joint tenancy have an automatic
  right of partition → they can just leave and get out of it]{.mark}

[How is co-ownership otherwise regulated outside of remedy of
partition?]{.underline}

- A co-owner can make **threat of exit** → I'll leave unless you do X

- Or, have a **contract between parties** that sets out norms that
  govern proper use

*Delfino v. Vealencis* → partition by sale / partition in kind

**Facts:** Two families owned a plot of land as tenants in common. The
Delfinos owned 69% and Vealencis owned 31%. Vealencis lived on the
land + operated trash removal business out of property as well. Delfinos
did not actually have possession of their parcel (they lived elsewhere).
Delfinos wanted the court to order **partition by sale**, but Vealencis
wanted **partition in kind.**

- **By sale** - sold at auction + divide \$ proportionate that matches
  ownership shares

- **In kind -** physically dividing property up between parties + each
  party will own their part all by themselves

<!-- -->

- Vealencis want partition by kind bc she wants to remain on the
  property and continue operating her business

- Delfinos want to build residential subdivision on their property
  post-partition; betting they will win at auction to buy Vealencis part
  of the plot

**Rule:** Policy is **to favor partition in kind**, unless both of
following are true:

> *Have to have both conditions!*

- [Dividing in kind would be impractical or inequitable]{.underline}

- [Selling the property would be better to serve owner's
  interests]{.underline}

**Application:** Physical partition is feasible - subdivision is
possible even with the business present

- Owners interest - Delfinos might lose market value by having the
  business next door, so yes, physical partition is not in THEIR
  interest, but **you have to consider BOTH parties interests**

  - Vealencis home + livelihood depended on being on this property for
    several yrs

- **Only one set of owners interests would be served** by physical
  partition, so the second requirement isn't satisfied

  - The second requirement is that ALL owners interests would be better
    satisfied by partition by sale

- Court orders partition by kind

  - Trial court had divided up the property in kind - gave Vealencis
    only 1 acre out of 20.5 acres, and ordered her to pay an owelty

  - **Owelty =** payment to correct an imbalance that arises from
    partitioning in kind

  - Partitioning property in kind often cannot be done in exactly the
    way the parties interests are apportioned

    - Unique physical characteristics of property - like a ridge
      unevenly dividing the property

      - Person who gets smaller portion pays \$ to the other party (an
        owelty) to ensure the market value of what everyone gets is
        50/50

- Today, most states still favor partition in mind in some shape or form

- Might be a trend for support for partition by sale, which makes sense
  bc modern property is less likely to be easily divisible

  - Against partition by sale → sentimental value to property that
    cannot be valued in dollars, social cost going to be lost in the
    sale bc no one is going to pay more for the property just bc it has
    an extra sentimental value for you

**[Partition is not the only relief co-tenants can seek]{.underline}**

- Under some circumstances, co-tenants can receive a damages award
  against the other co-tenant

*Gillmor v. Gillmor* → ousted co-tenant can sue co-tenant for damages
for refusal to accommodate co-tenants demands

**Facts:** Co-tenants shared land used for cattle grazing. Defendant who
had possession kept plaintiff, who had a right to use the land for her
cattle to graze, from doing so. This goes against co-tenancy in common,
because each tenant has an **equal right to possess the whole**.

[If co-tenant is ousted from possession, ousted co-tenant can sue for
their share of rents and profits from the common property, aka
"accounting and damages."]{.underline}

**#1 → Awarding an Accounting and Damages**

- Only applies if there's been an ouster

**Ouster =** if party in possession **excludes the other party** or acts
in a way that necessarily excludes the other party

- Mere fact other property used the property isn't enough, even if the
  other party is the only party to use the property → bc every co-tenant
  has a right to use and occupy the property, **as long as the use
  doesn't interfere w/ other parties equal right**

<!-- -->

- Here, there was ouster bc there needed to be accommodation between the
  two to accommodate both of them grazing, but D was unwilling + grazed
  so much that P could not graze w/o overgrazing and ruining property

- Court awards accounting in damages because there was a c**lear,
  unequivocable demand to the tenant in possession** combined **w/ a
  refusal to accommodate the co-tenants demand**

  - Court awards an **accounting in damages**

**#2 Contribution - contributions can be required among co-tenants, but
not always**

- Ordinarily if a co-tenant who possesses a property unilaterally makes
  improvements to the property, the co-tenant who does so **cannot
  demand** the other co-tenant help pay for them → can't pass cost on to
  other tenant

  - **Tenant who made changes is responsible** for entire cost of
    changes

  - This is general rule - [there are exceptions]{.underline}

    - #1 If co-tenant in possession did so in good faith belief they
      were the only one who owned the property → in this case, court may
      require contribution bc otherwise its unfair

    - #2 estoppel scenario

      - Co-tenant who's out of possession but knew the co-tenant in
        possession was making the changes, but kept quiet about it, even
        tho they didn't approve of the improvements

      - Estoppel might step in and require B to contribute

    - #3 if repairs were **NECESSARY** in order to preserve or protect
      the property, both parties should share in the cost of that

- Here, D was seeking contribution for fence he put up

  - [Court says he can get contribution if he **proves the repairs were
    necessary AND expenses were reasonable**]{.mark}

- Court says here there should be a contribution, this is cattle grazing
  property, you need a fence around it, that\'s a necessary expense

**[Severance]{.underline}**

- Converts a joint tenancy to a tenancy in common

  - NOT partition - partition converts joint tenancy or tenancy in
    common into SEPARATE ownership, fees altogether

- Severance does NOT eliminate the co-ownership relationship

  - [It converts joint tenancy to a tenancy in common]{.mark}

    - Either joint tenant can unilaterally sever a joint tenancy, in
      common law, you do this by severing one of the four units by for
      example engaging in straw transaction

*Harms v. Sprague*

**Facts:** Two brothers owned property in joint tenancy. John created a
mortgage interest in Simmons and left his share of the property in his
will to Sprague. John dies.

- If the mortgage to Simmons severed the joint tenancy, John and William
  would own simply as "tenants in common", and tenants in common do NOT
  have a right of survivorship → thus when John died, his will WOULD be
  effective and Sprague would get the interest

[#1 Does a mortgage by one joint tenant sever the joint tenancy,
creating a tenancy in common?]{.underline}

- No. Destroying one of the 4 unities would - if John had SOLD his
  interest to Simmons, that would have severed the joint tenancy. But a
  mortgage does not involve a transfer in this way. There hasn't been a
  conveyance, so that doesn't severe the joint tenancy

  - Note it could have, if John stopped making the mortgage payments and
    redemption period expired, Simmons would be able to take the
    property

- Unilateral mortgage does not sever the joint tenancy

[#2 Does the mortgage survive the mortgager's death as a
lien?]{.underline}

- Does John's real property interest that was securing the mortgage
  still secure the mortgage after John dies?

- No. This was a lien on the giver, John's, interest. Once John dies,
  his interest vanishes, it is not transferred. When John died, his
  interest vanished and his interest was the interest that was securing
  the mortgage. Once John's interest is gone when he dies, there's
  nothing left securing the mortgage, so Simmons loses out as well.

  - Simmons no longer has the security for the mortgage, but Simmons
    might still be able to make a claim that he is owed the \$, might
    not be able to get it bc he lacks the security interest, but in
    practice can raise a claim

- Thus, Williams retains 100% of the property

[Simmons should have required both joint tenants sign the mortgage, so
he could have recovered.]{.underline}

[What if Williams died first?]{.underline}

- John now owns 100% of the property. The mortgage is now, as a general
  rule, still secured only by John's original interest in the property,
  not the new, 100% interest

[[Unilateral mortgages doesn't sever joint tenancy]{.underline}]{.mark}

- Courts differ as to if a unilateral *lease* severs a joint tenancy -
  depends on jurisdiction

- Courts do agree one tenant murdering another tenant does sever the
  joint tenancy

<!-- -->

- If John had *sold* his interest to SImmons, that would have severed
  the joint tenancy

**[Leases]{.underline}**

- Leases transfer possession, so transfer the right to exclude, unlike
  licenses or easements, which are rights to use, not to possess

[4 types of common law leases]{.underline}

**Term of years**

- Lease that ends automatically on a **definite, fixed ending date**
  (could be less than 1 year)

  - If more than 1 year, has to be in writing

  - Bc it ends automatically, neither party needs to give notice

**Periodic tenancy**

- Automatically rolls over/renews for a specified period of time

- Periodic tendency also ends on a certain date, but automatically
  continues to renew until another party stops it

  - Like a month to month lease

  - Either party may terminate, but termination typically requires
    advance notice, with the time period usually being the same as the
    lease period

    - If it's a year to year, generally don't have to give 1 yr notice -
      depends on jurisdiction

**Tenancy at will**

- Can be terminated by either party at any time for any reason

- Many jurisdictions do require advance notice

  - How much notice usually depends on the payment period

    - If you pay monthly = 1 month advance notice

**Tenancy at sufferance**

- Not really a lease/tenancy at all bc tenant doesn't have any real
  right to possess at all

- Arises when there's a lease, lease ends, and tenant doesn't leave

- Tenant is different from a trespasser bc a trespasser didn't have
  permission to ever go on the property

  - Tenant at sufferance did have permission, at some point...

- Landlord has right to evict, but may not have a right to self-help

[Big theme in leases is allocation of risk]{.underline}

- Law sorting out how to allocate risk in situations where there are
  asymmetries of information and control between landlord + tenants

*Paradine v. Jane* → tenant bears the risk that a third party might
dispossess tenant of property

**Facts:** P sued D under a lease for years of unpaid rent. D argued D
was forced out of possession of the property due to invasion of an enemy
during war.

**Holding:** The covenant of quiet enjoyment is separate from the
covenant of a tenant to pay rent.

**Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment doctrine:** landlord themself will not
interfere with tenants possession/enjoyment of the land → [but is NOT a
guarantee no one else will interfere]{.underline}

- Tenant takes all of the risk tenant might benefit from land - and all
  of the risk they might be burdened, too

  - Tenant doesn't need to share the profits of the land, but likewise,
    cannot burden landlord with lack of profits

<!-- -->

- When party by his own contract creates a duty upon himself, he is
  bound to the duty notwithstanding accident, because he **could have
  provided against it in the contract**

> → Rent is duty created by the parties, and D must make it good,
> regardless of interruption from enemies, for **the law will not
> protect him beyond the agreement**

- D must run the burden of casual losses and cannot place burden on P
  lessor

[Since this case, law has moved away from independent covenants and
towards linking of covenants.]{.underline}

- Important exception of even independent covenants → If house is
  totally destroyed, you don't have to pay rent

- **Commercial leases →** more like common law, which is more similar to
  the holding of this case (the covenants are independent) and NOT
  similar of residential leases today

*Smith v. McEnany* → covenant of quiet enjoyment and covenant to pay
rent are dependent covenants

**Facts:** P, landlord, intentionally encroached on tenant, D's, leased
property with a wall he built by only about 9 inches to 2 feet. D
withheld rent and P sued.

**Holding:** A landlord deliberately and intentionally depriving tenants
of possessing **even just a small amount of property** justifies tenants
ceasing to pay rent throughout the duration of the encroachment.

- [Even a small deprivation violates covenant of quiet enjoyment]{.mark}

- Covenant to pay is conditional on covenant of quiet enjoyment being
  fulfilled

  - However, a covenant for the tenant to maintain a shed on property
    *was* considered an independent covenant to landlord\'s covenant of
    quiet enjoyment, thus tenant was obligated to still maintain shed

- Significant departure from *Paradine v. Jane,* where tenant was
  displaced but *still* owed rent, whereas here, tenant isn't even
  displace and *still doesn't owe rent*

- "Land is hired as one whole. If, by his own fault, landlord withdraws
  a part of it, he cannot recover."

*Medico Dental v. Horton & Converse* → remedies for breach of covenant

**Facts:** P owned a medical building and leased a space out to D, a
drugstore. The lease had a restrictive covenant that prevented P from
leasing any other portion of the building to another business selling
drugs. D found out another tenant, a doctor, was selling drugs to his
own patients. D rescinds its lease and stops paying rent. P sues D for
the unpaid rent.

**Holding:** The restrictive covenant and covenant to pay rent are
dependent. Thus, tenant is allowed to withhold rent while lessor is
violating restrictive covenant.

[[Evidence covenants were dependent / intended to be linked]{.underline}
→ *look at intent of the parties*]{.mark}

- Both covenants were in a rider together

- Plain language of agreement

- Obvious the subject matter of the covenant to not have competition in
  the building was crucial to D and thus likely a material part of
  consideration that induced D to enter agreement / agree to pay rent

- Court also considers fact breach was **substantial →** maybe court
  would hold covenants were independent had breach not been substantial

[Options for Remedies]{.underline}

- Rescind the lease (what D did)

- Stay with lease, but sue for lost profits for violation of the
  covenant

- Rescind the lease later, and sue for damages between time of breach +
  when they rescinded

[In general, major breaches tend to be treated as breaches of dependent
covenants.]{.underline}

*Sutton v. Temple* → caveat lessee - let the tenant beware, no implied
warranty of fitness

**Fact:** D leased P's patch of grass to field his cattle in. D and P
did not know the grass had been poisoned with paint. As a result, D
vacated the land prior to his lease termination date and refused to pay
for the rest of the lease. P sued for the remaining lease.

**Holding:** Tenant has to pay lease because of **caveat lessee** - let
the tenant beware.

- There are no implied warranties of fitness in leases; the tenant bears
  the risk that the property will turn out to be unsuitable for the
  tenants purposes, unless the landlord committed fraud in concealing
  the problem, or the two parties negotiated explicitly to create an
  express warranty of fitness.

  - *Note, even though there is no implied warranty of fitness, it's
    always possible there could be an express warranty of fitness - but
    rare for parties to agree to that in a lease*

- Landlord didn't misrepresent grass so **absent fraud**, the tenant has
  to pay the remaining balance.

**Reasoning:** Tenant is allocated the risk bc tenant has better
knowledge of knowing what tenant wants and if the property is suitable
for tenants purposes

**[Mitigating caveat lessee]{.underline}**

*Blackett v. Olanoff* → constructive eviction

**Facts:** Landlord rented one parcel of land as a residency and an
adjacent parcel to a club. The tenant of the residence claimed the club
was too loud, so left and argued constructive eviction.

**Constructive conviction** = someone's conduct substantially interfered
w/ tenants use and enjoyment of the leased property AND the landlord can
be held responsible for that conduct

- Here, the music was very loud, no question it substantially interfered
  with tenants use + enjoyment, and the landlord can be held responsible
  for the club's conduct because t**hey knew when renting the space to
  operate a club**, noise would be a natural and probable consequence,
  and landlord also had ability to tell club to not be as noisey

  - Landlord **could control** the club (they had told club to quiet
    down before + they had for short period of time, shows they had
    control over tenant)

**Holding:** The club music being too loud to live in a residential
apartment constituted a constructive eviction and thus the tenant can
get out of their lease.

- *For tenant to claim constructive eviction, tenant needs to have
  vacated property in reasonable time*

# *Gotlieb v. Taco Bell Corporation* → surrender of property when landlord sent lease proposal to new potential tenant

**Facts:** P agreed to lease property to TB for 20 years. TB agreed to
get government approval to open the restaurant, but were permitted to
cancel the lease if they couldn't get approval within a 6 permitting
period beginning when the lease started. Community groups opposed TB.

TB both filed for a permit and repudiated on the lease on the day before
the end of the permitting period. P sued TB for breach of lease and for
unpaid rent. D refused to pay. Over a year into the lease with TB, P
leased the property to Rite Aid at a higher price than TB's lease was.

**Holding:** Landlord accepted TB's surrender by operation of law /
implied acceptance; landlord meeting with Rite Aid was more than a mere
attempt to find another lease, it demonstrated intent to accept TB's
surrender.

[[Landlords have 3 options when tenants attempt to repudiate/surrender a
lease before its expiration:]{.underline}]{.mark}

- 1\) Reject the repudiation and do nothing → tenant still liable for
  rent

- 2\) Accept repudiation, re-enter and relet the property to someone
  else for the **landlord's benefit**

  - Original lease no longer exists, tenant no longer owes any rent, and
    landlord just has lease w/ new tenant. **Attractive option for
    landlord if market rate has gone up / landlord can find tenants for
    higher lease**

- 3\) Reject the repudiation, enter the premises and relet **for the
  tenant's benefit**

  - Acting as the agent of the tenant

  - Tenant remains liable for any difference in the rent between the
    original contract amount and what the landlord is able to get for
    leasing it to someone else

  - **Attractive option for landlord even if market rate hasn't gone up
    / if market rate has stayed the same / *maybe* even if market rate
    is lower** bc landlord doesn\'t need to worry about recovering
    tenants rent, landlord can find better tenant who will pay rent

[Surrender can be accepted 2 different ways]{.underline}

- An express agreement **or** by operation of law

  - Explicitly or implicitly

  - Was there an express agreement between the parties that repudiation
    is accepted?

> **OR**

- Was there an implicit acceptance of the repudiation / acceptance of
  repudiation by the operation of law?

  - Some act so inconsistent with landlord/tenant relationship, which
    implies their intent to deem lease terminated, acceptance of
    repudiation would be implied → eg. changing the locks

- Applies even if there was an "outward refusal" to accept the
  repudiation

  - If landlord declares they rejected the repudiation, but changes the
    locks, the landlord has implicitly accepted the repudiation

[Once surrender is accepted, the tenant is off the hook. They owe
nothing for rent due after surrender.]{.underline}

- Here, P was not merely meeting with Rite Aid to try and find another
  lessee; **when P sent a lease proposal to Rite Aid, they implied
  acceptance of TB's surrender.**

**Duty to Mitigate**

*Sommer v. Kridel* → landlord must take reasonable efforts to relet
property after original tenant repudiates

**Facts:** D puts down deposit and signs 2 year lease, but breaks lease
a month before lease started. Landlord eventually relets apartment to
someone else at the same price, but 16 months after the apartment had
first been advertised. Landlord sues D for 16 months of rent plus the
security deposit *(who knows why 16 PLUS security deposit, that's false
math).*

**Holding:** Duty to mitigate requires **landlord take reasonable
efforts** to lease property to someone else after lessee breaches, and
the landlord bears burden of proving they took reasonable efforts.

[Duty to mitigate is **majority rule in US for residential
property**]{.underline}

- Commercial leases → generally no duty to mitigate

[Tenant can plead both surrender and duty to mitigate in the
alternative]{.underline}

- Even if tenant didn't successfully surrender lease and is thus bound
  by it → landlord *still* might have duty to mitigate, which could in
  turn limit tenant's damages

- Which one applies, surrender or duty to mitigate, makes a financial
  difference to the tenant

[If landlord doesn't accept tenant's surrender → landlord relets on
tenant's behalf]{.underline}

- Tenant is obligated to pay landlord's **reasonable costs of
  reletting**

- Tenant **has to pay its full rent** until landlord finds new tenant

  - **If new tenant's lease is less than original tenant's lease**,
    tenant will have to pay difference in rent for each month remaining
    on original lease

[If landlord does accept tenant's surrender → landlord relets on
landlord's behalf]{.underline}

- Tenant has no obligation to pay any rent once landlord accepts
  surrender

  - After surrender is accepted → lease disappears

  - Even if landlord is reletting at a loss, tenant still doesn't have
    to pay

- **Attractive option if market rate has risen** → landlord can get
  higher rent, tenant doesn't need to be on the hook bc landlord doesn't
  need tenant's rent anymore bc landlord is getting it from someone
  else, everyone is happy

[If duty to mitigate applies...]{.underline}

- Landlord has duty to take reasonable efforts to try and relet
  apartment

  - Court decides what is **reasonable amount of time** to relet
    apartment

- Tenant still liable for full rent during reasonable amount of time to
  relet apartment

- **If landlord relets apartment during reasonable amount of time**

  - Tenant is liable for full rent during reasonable amount of time +
    difference between relet rent and tenant's original rent *if there
    is a difference* → if surplus, landlord gets to keep

- **If landlord hasn't relet apartment after reasonable time has
  passed**

  - Tenant is liable for the difference between what the landlord
    *could* relet the apartment for and their rent

    - If market rate is same as tenant's rent → tenant liable for \$0

    - If market rate is more than tenant's rent → tenant is also liable
      for \$0, but **[landlord should be incentivized to accept tenant's
      surrender + get a higher lease]{.mark}**

  - This is a big difference if market rent is less than tenant's rent,
    and small or no difference if market rate is close to or equal to
    tenant's rent

  - **If landlord is not reletting because the market price has
    dropped**

    - Landlord might [still save more \$ NOT fulfilling duty to
      mitigate]{.underline}

      - If fulfilled duty → landlord would lose \$ by having to rent at
        a lower price, and tenant isn't going to be liable once landlord
        relets apartment after reasonable time has passed

      - If didn't fulfill duty → landlord gets the difference between
        tenant's rent and market rent, which is significant and close to
        tenant's rent

        - **Better for landlord to not fulfill duty + keep getting
          (almost all of) tenant's rent v. low market rent**

**Reletting on the tenants behalf** = not accepting surrender, tenant
still needs to be in picture

If landlord is reletting on behalf of the tenant, this means that the
landlord has not accepted the surrender of vacancy

- If lease is done on behalf of the tenant, surrender has been rejected

- If landlord accepts the surrender, landlord is reletting on HIS own
  behalf

- If landlord does NOT accept surrender, landlord is letting on TENANTS
  behalf

![](media/image11.png){width="6.5in" height="3.5in"}

*Javins v. First National Realty* 1970 → implied warranty of
habitability

**Facts:** Tenants withheld rent due to various violations of housing
code in their apartment.

**Holding:** There is an implied warranty of habitability as defined by
the Housing Code and it is dependent on the tenant's implied covenant to
pay rent.

- Moving away from old rule where tenant bears burden for all repairs,
  even major repairs

- In most jurisdictions, this warranty is statute, and it is **not
  waivable** - it is a mandatory rule

- Implied warranty of habitability is **dependent on tenant's implied
  covenant to pay rent** → if landlord breaches, tenant doesn't have to
  pay rent

  - *Potential exception →* If there is only a partial breach, tenant
    might be exempt from paying only part of the rent (get a discount)

[Rationale for making implied warranty of habitability]{.underline}

- **1) Common law default rule (old rule) no longer makes sense in the
  modern world**

  - Tenants are no longer handy, good at repairing things, incompetent
    urban dwellers, modern housing more complex so harder to repair

  - Tenant cannot internalize the full benefit for repairs that are made

  - Tenants frequently move since they are renting, so if they repair
    the property they get no benefit

    - [Landlord can internalize all the costs AND the benefits for
      repair]{.mark}

      - Landlord can charge more money after tenant moves out

- **2) Landlord tenant law should be consistent with consumer protection
  law**

  - Law implies warranty of fitness for consumer goods, makes sense we
    imply it for housing too

- **3) Unequal bargaining power**

  - Standardized form leases lead to unequal bargaining power

    - (Real concern if there's only one set of terms available, monopoly
      situation, all landlords are using the same form)

    - Empathized the standardized being the issue → not the form itself

    - No meaningful consumer choice for standardized monopoly

  - Race and class discrimination

    - More limits on places you can rent → more leverage
      sellers/landlords have as supply gets constrained

- **4) Poor quality housing hurts the entire city**

  - ... but why is it that this should fall entirely on landlords and
    not the entire city?

  - Why are public housing, vouchers not the solution? Why is the city
    (gov) not responsible for this? Who should be paying for this - the
    government/city or landlords?

[In sum, leases for urban dwelling units should be "treated like any
other contract"]{.underline}

- Treat leases like ordinary contracts → similar to *Sommer v. Kridel*
  rational

- Lee critiques the rationale that leases are really being treated like
  contracts

  - Unwaivable warranties are not typical in ordinary contract law...

**[Takings Law]{.underline}**

**Eminent Domain**

**[Power of eminent domain is often said to be an implied attribute of
sovereignty.]{.underline}**

- Gov must have this power merely by virtue of being a gov

  - To be a gov, gov has to have eminent domain power

- Eminent domain in US is both federal and state gov

- Power is typically delegated to smaller entities

  - Lower tier entities, commonly towns or cities

  - Sometimes might even be delegated to some businesses

    - Typically utility companies + railroads

  - Sometimes even delegated to individuals who have landlocked property
    (easements by necessity)

  - Sometimes individuals will use eminent domain to obtain easements of
    access across another person's property to avoid being landlocked

**[Eminent domain power is limited by both statutes and the
constitution.]{.underline}**

- 5th Amendment + 14th Amendment Due Process Clause, people get to be
  heard + challenge gov authority to exercise imminent domain

  - [Fifth Amendment Takings Clause]{.underline}

    - "Nor shall private property be taken for public use without just
      compensation" → federal provision, but has been incorporated to
      the states

    - Most state constitutions also have similar clauses → [but note
      they can be interpreted differently than the federal
      constitutional cause, even if they are written exactly the
      same]{.mark}

- Eminent domain proceeds are referred to as condemnation proceedings

  - Person who owns property being taken = condemnee

- Voluntary exchanges are often possible

  - Gov can purchase property instead of exercising eminent domain

**[Economic Justification for Eminent Domain]{.underline}**

- Property markets are often "thin markets" → real property is not
  "fungible", the unique aspects of real property are valued by owners,
  10 acres in one place is not the same as 10 acres in another place

  - *Recall common law doctrine → every property is unique*

- Owner of real property has a "local monopoly"

  - Often not possible to substitute some the property w/ some other
    property

  - Eg. you need to get property in that specific location, but you
    can't, bc owner has "local monopoly"

- Creates potential of **strategic holdout problems**

  - If project requires acquiring large amount of property w/o eminent
    domain, significant potential a land owner will hold out selling
    property to project owners

- Similar to concern re: issuing injunctions in ways that give one party
  too much bargaining power over another party → owner of local monopoly
  has significant bargaining leverage

  - Result is either project owner has to pay insane amount of property,
    has to build project around property, or may not be able to do
    project altogether → potential of **economic waste**

- Also possibility that people are just emotionally holding out → have
  value to the specific property

**[Calabrese & Melamed]{.underline}**

- Property rule protection means that if the entitlement changes hands,
  it will do so only at a price agreed to by the property owner

- If outcome of this is socially costly, then you can give the gov the
  entitlement and the property rule protection, which allows gov to
  confiscate the land to build railroad, etc, so that we all get the
  social benefit of the railroad

- The law does the OTHER Calabrese Melamed category

  - Gives entitlement to OWNER, but protects it only with **liability
    rule protection**

    - [This means entitlement can c**hange hands at a price that is set
      by an external entity** (in eminent domain, the market value of
      property)]{.mark} rather than what property owner would demand

      - Addresses holdout issues

**[Basic structure of takings law is in Fifth Amendment]{.underline}**

- "Nor shall private property be taken for public use without just
  compensation"

  - Two requirements of imminent domain power

  - [Must be for **public use** and **just compensation must be
    paid**]{.mark}

    - **Public use requirement**

      - Later 20th century, meaning was broadened from just things open
        to public to include more things to qualify

      - Having some **public purpose, public benefit**

        - SC gives great deference to state legislatures in determining
          the definition of this

    - **Just compensation requirement**

    - *US v. Miller*, USSC → property's fair market value

      - Defined as what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in
        cash

      - Does NOT include sentimental value, bc hard to quantify

<!-- -->

- Taking land to expand coast guard academy → yes

- Taking land from one private person to give to another private person
  → no

- Taking land from private owner to give to another private entity as
  part of a public economic development project? → is this public use or
  not?

*Kelo v. City of New London, Connecticut* USSC 2005

**Facts:** D approved new development project that involved using
eminent domain authority to seize private property to sell to private
developers for a public economic development project. City argued the
purpose of project was to create new jobs and increase tax revenues from
the sale of property. Ps brought suit arguing project violated public
use requirement of Fifth Amendment.

**Holding:** Yes, city may validly exercise eminent domain authority to
take private property to distribute to private developers; this fulfills
the public use requirement required of the Fifth Amendment.

**[Reasoning]{.underline}**

- No pretext and city carefully formulated the plan

- No principled way to distinguish economic development from other
  public purposes → sometimes better serving the public must be done
  through private enterprise

  - However, merely generating tax revenue might not be a good enough
    reason

  - **Federalism argument →** great deference to states to determine
    public needs

    - States are free to establish more constitutional protections if
      you wish

- [Court rejects use by the public test - taking does not need to be
  specifically for use for the public, rather, can be taken for **public
  benefit**, as long as there is a genuine purpose to the public
  benefit]{.mark}

  - Pretext isn't allowed, but as long as its non-pretextual, that's
    good enough

[Policy reasons]{.underline}

- **Use by the public test is difficult to administer**

  - How much access to the public is enough?

    - For eg., schools are only accessible by children, but has a public
      benefit to everyone

    - For eg., can't just go on air force base

- **Use by the public test is pretty constrained**

  - Limits number of things that are going to qualify under this, and
    limiting it this way is impractical

[Doctrinal reasons]{.underline}

- *Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff* → state transferred ownership of
  residential property from the owners to the lessees

  - SC upheld→ public purpose was "emining the social and economic evils
    of land oligopoly"

- *Burman v. Parker* → state took over blighted area and redeveloped it
  for various purposes, including roads, schools but also leasing or
  selling the properties to private parties for redevelopment,
  specifically for affordable housing

  - SC upheld

**Dissent, O'Connor:** Beneficiaries of this sort of thing are those
that have political power; people who have political power will be
immune to takings whereas those w/ no political power will be harmed

- Transferring private property to another private entity is inherently
  problematic

- Slippery slope → so long as something more socially valuable exists,
  everything is prone to be taken

- Cf. *Hawaii + Burman*, both achieved DIRECT benefits, here thre is no
  affirmative harm that is being addressed

  - Indirect vs. direct benefit

**Dissent, Marshall:** there is racial bias in the application of these
takings

[Implications]{.underline}

- Many states have amended their state constitutions to prohibit the
  sorts of takings *Kelo* allowed

Today's principle justification is an economic one, based on the problem
of intractable holdouts

- Someone people will just refuse to relinquish their property

Eminent domain came up based on the problem above, but there are
constraints per prior notes

Kilo - expansive understanding of what satisfies public use requirement

Having some public purpose is enough → even if its taking property for
economic redevelopment by private organizations

**[Regulatory Takings]{.underline}**

- If gov is acting under police power - does NOT need to pay
  compensation

- If gov is acting eminent domain power - DOES have to pay just
  compensation

- If gov is addressing public nuisance, gov can force you to clean it up
  without compensation\...but gov CANNOT take your lot and turn it into
  a garden w/o compensation

- Two ways courts can decide if government action counts as a regulatory
  taking

  - [#1 Use categorical rules - **Per se taking doctrine**]{.underline}

    - "X action counts as a regulatory undertaking"

    - Taking per se - if gov does X its a regulatory taking

    - Not many of them - two examples from USSC

      - *Loretto v. Teleprompter* → gov action will be a per se taking
        if its gov authorization of a permanent physical occupation

      - *Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council* → gov action will be
        per se taking if it eliminates ALL economically beneficial use
        of the land AND doesn't simply mirror the result state nuisance
        law would have produced

        - Not doing what nuisance law would already have done, and
          eliminates 100% of the economic value of the property

          - 99.99% NOT a per se taking

  - [#2 Use ad hoc rules]{.underline}

    - Much more common

    - Applies when gov regulations are less drastic but nevertheless
      constitute a taking

*Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon* → regulation is a regulatory
undertaking bc it totally burdened railroad to no benefit on their
behalf

> *First case to take ad hoc approach to regulatory takings. Essentially
> overturned by Penn Central*

**Facts:** PA Coal leased out surface land to Mahon, with a provision
that they would continue to mine coal under his property and that Mahon
accepted the surface rights subject to any risks associated with the
company's coal mining. Even if mining damaged Mahon's property, he
agreed to be liable for all damages. Later, PA state legislature passed
the Kohler Act, which prohibited mining underneath surfaces with
residential dwellings, such as underneath Mahon's property. Mahon sought
an injunction against PA Coal to get them to stop mining under his
property.

[Majority, Holmes]{.underline}

- Regulation took entire property rights, and thus its a taking for
  constitutional purposes

- "Whether a regulation constitutes a taking is a **question of degree**
  and therefore cannot be disposed of by general propositions"

  - Depends on case individual facts

  - "If regulation goes too far, it'll be a taking" but also "not every
    incidental reduction in property value, caused by changes in general
    laws, should be compensated"

[Dissent, Brandeis]{.underline}

- Regulation only took one fraction of property right and was not a
  regulatory taking

  - People should not be able to hide in contracts and away from gov
    regulation which is done to prevent harm

**[Test for determining if regulation is considered a
taking]{.underline}**

- *H & B agreed ad hoc approach is right*

- *H & B agreed first 3 factors were relevant*

- *H & B disagreed how the factors should be applied to the present
  case*

- *B disagreed w/ H that 4th factor is relevant*

[#1 How big was the diminution in property value caused by the
regulation?]{.underline}

- **Holmes:** Property value should be assessed by the value of the coal
  pillars that the mine installed to prevent the surface from collapsing
  from their mining

  - Now, the pillars are worthless → **huge diminution in property
    value**

  - *Lee → why is the denominator the pillar value, and not the
    reduction of value of not being able to mine coal under this
    property?*

- **Brandeis:** Should look at total value of the mining rights that are
  involved in the contract, and see how much mining rights have been
  reduced

  - Mining rights involved in contract are only relatively small
    fraction → **insignificant diminution in property value**, property
    is still very valuable even if they can't mine just right under
    Mahon's home

- If you take Holmes' approach to the extreme ... every regulation
  prohibiting doing anything at all might trip this condition, since
  every regulation says you no longer have the right to do X

  - Epstein's argument → every prohibitory regulation is a taking
    (unless it prohibits a nuisance) and therefore gov has to compensate
    for it

[#2 Is activity being regulated a public nuisance?]{.underline}

> *If so, then it is regularable under police power and gov doesn't owe
> compensation*

- Here, relevant interest was protecting people from harm from surface
  collapsing

  - **Holmes:** Regulation is not preventing harm to the general public,
    regulation does not address harm in homes collapsing due to mining
    \-- state could require mining companies to provide notice to the
    owners of the surface + require support, other ways to address this

  - **Brandeis:** This was exercise of police power + regulated
    obnoxious use that could be considered public nuance

[#3 Was there average reciprocity of advantage?]{.underline}

- Does this regulation, in placing a burden on the plaintiff, also
  provide a benefit to the plaintiff by requiring others to comply as
  well?

  - And is the benefit **roughly equal** to the burden?

    - If yes, then it doesn't look like a regulatory undertaking bc
      there is average reciprocity of advantage

    - If not, then it looks more like a taking

    - **Holmes:** Here, no average reciprocity of advantage bc the
      burden is placed on the mining company/owners of mining rights and
      the benefit is being enjoyed by Mahon/owners of surface rights -
      *not* the mining companies

      - Mining company gets no benefit just bc other mining companies
        can't dig out coal

    - **Brandeis:** Agrees that there is no reciprocal advantage, but
      says it is not relevant → it is only relevant when regulation
      seeks to provide a **benefit** to public, rather than preventing
      harm to the public

      - *Lee doesn't like this argument, can you really tell a
        difference?*

[#4 Regulation destroyed existing property and contract
rights]{.underline}

- **Holmes** → regulation is destroying existing property + contract
  rights, it\'s a taking

- **Brandeis** → This analysis is not helpful for determining if its a
  regulatory taking, individuals shouldn't be able to sequester their
  rights from police power simply by making a private contract about
  those rights

  - Regulation shouldn't be stopped just bc you say you privately
    contracted to do XYZ, and thus no longer bound by such regulations

  - Brandeis believed we need good gov police stuff and no one should be
    able to hide from gov regulation, essentially

    - *Technically in above hypo you'd still be bound by the regs, but
      then able to get compensation*

- *Note, if you can't afford to pay the compensation, then you can't do
  the regulation at all*

*Penn Central Transportation v. City of New York* → landmarks
preservation regulation preventing building was typical regulation to
promote common good and was not a regulatory taking requiring just
compensation

**Facts:** Penn Central needs \$ so wants to build office building on
top of Grand Central. NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission says no.
Penn Central sues for compensation, saying its a regulatory taking.

**Holding:** The regulation was not a taking requiring just
compensation.

[Test for if its a regulatory taking → NEW "ad hoc", multifactor test
for determining if a taking that requires compensation]{.underline}

- **Diminution in value**

  - Economic detriment to party

  - whole parcel for denominator

  - Same as Brandeis' dissent in *Pennsylvania Coal*

  <!-- -->

  - **Extent to which regulation interferes with distinct investment
    backed expectations**

    - Here, no.

    - Primary expectation here was to use it as train terminal + they
      are still allowed to do that

    - Regulation doesn't interfere w/ Penn Central's earning a
      reasonable rate of return, they can sell the TDR rights

  - **The character of gov action**

    - Was it physical invasion that would be regulatory taking or did
      the regulation merely "adjust the benefits and burdens of economic
      life to promote the common good"?

      - Here, it was just telling them they can't build there, zoning
        regulation

      - Zoning = constitutional

      - Here too, general regulation for the common good

> **Dissent, Rehnquist:** Should have used PA coal factors, and if so,
> this was a taking. This was not abating a nuisance. [This was not
> exercise of police power.]{.mark} This was not trying to prevent
> dangerous conduct, or promote the safety, health or welfare of others.

- Here, all they cared about was the esthetics of the new building.

<!-- -->

- Difference between what is preventing a harm and providing a benefit
  is a little murky...

- Does not offer average reciprocity of advantage

  - Landmarks law, when applied to individual buildings rather than
    historic districts, imposes heavy burdens on a small fraction of NY
    property owners

  - Point of landmarks law is to preserve **historic district** where
    **everyone benefits**

    - Here, no one actually benefits from building not being built

  - Penn Railroad is not benefitting from the fact other things are
    landmarked, they are being singled out and being limited arbitrarily

    - This eliminates an existing property right, it effectively
      transfers servitude to the city that prevented building in a
      certain way

      - Servitude is usually bought or acquired via eminent domain

    - Any alteration now requires gov approval

      - Partial compensation for TDR is not fair market compensation

      - Paying compensation is not very expensive for taxpayers if you
        divide the expenses up among everyone

Eg. You are only allowed to build up to 50 stories, but you can buy
neighbor's TDR to build 48 stories to then build up to 98 stories.

Some courts explicitly apply the Penn Central factors, some don't.

I think he said something about zoning for parking for residents of a
nearby building is not a voluntary undertaking and is just zoning, and
also seems to have a reciprocal advantage bc the tenant protection →
ensure you have palace to park, implied warranty of habitability is also
not a taking. So protecting tenants by ensuring they have a habitable
apartment, but also have a place where they can park their car near
their apartment... what's the difference?

- Regulatory taking is as you can see highly controversial

- **Sovereign immunity usually protects government from being sued** for
  creating nuisances, etc.

  - Conceivably, you could sue gov for nuisance, but doing so can be
    challenging

- Guess is this would be played out would be, owner next to freeway
  would get extra compensation

If acting under police power → gov does not need to pay

If addressing public nuisance → gov does not need to pay
