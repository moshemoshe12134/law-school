Property -- Professor Lee, Spring 2021

**[Introduction and Acquiring Property]{.underline}**

**I. First Possession**

***A. Overview***

1.  **First possession** is a widespread device for establishing claims
    of ownership in a variety of contexts. The most familiar principle
    for establishing a new root of title is simply being the first to
    possess something that is unclaimed.

***B. Relationships among persons w/respect to personal property -- 3
basic concepts***

1.  **Possession** -- the controlling or holding of personal property,
    with or without claim of ownership.

    a.  It has two elements (both must be present to acquire the rights
        of a possessor):

        i.  \(1\) an intent to possess on the part of the possessor, and

        ii. \(2\) his or her actual controlling or holding the property

    b.  Possession is often a surrogate for ownership and title

    c.  Possessor has superior rights to personal property against all
        except those having higher rights or title

    d.  Possessor can recover possession of personal property or recover
        damages for its injury

2.  **Relativity of title** -- the idea that a person can have a
    relatively better title or right to possession than another, while
    simultaneously having a right inferior to yet another person

    a.  Doctrine is necessary since in common law, few acquire a perfect
        title

    b.  Doctrine requires that the person acquiring title litigate its
        relative strength against all other persons who have, or might
        conceivably have, any right or interest

3.  **First-in-time, first-in-right** -- one way to prioritize several
    individuals' rights is by a rule establishing a priority of rights
    based on the time of acquiring the right in question.

    a.  Underlying premise: all other things being equal, the
        chronologically first possessor has the better title

    b.  Sometimes subsequent possessors prevail over prior possessors
        (i.e., a good-faith purchaser or adverse possessor might acquire
        title superior to those came into possession before they did)

    c.  Title from a thief is void title

***C. Wild Animals***

1.  *Ratione soli* --\"by reason of the ownership of the soil;\"
    doctrine that justifies assigning property rights to landowners over
    resources (like wild animals) found on their own land

2.  *Ferae naturae* -- "wild by nature;" for wild animals, property
    rights exist only by possession, and are allocated by whomever is
    first -- **first-in-time to possession** gives one property rights
    to an animal

    a.  ***Pierson v. Post*** (NY 1805) -- Post (π) was hunting a fox on
        unpossessed land, and Pierson (∆), seeing this, captured and
        killed the same fox. π brought a trespass suit claiming that he
        had legal possession of the fox.

        i.  Majority -- goal is promoting certainty, preserving peace,
            avoiding quarrels; Fox should go to Pierson; derives rule
            from legal theorists and case law

            1.  General Rule: the pursuer is deemed to have possession
                if he satisfies all 3 of the following conditions:

                a.  \(1\) manifests an unequivocal intention of
                    appropriating the animal to his individual use

                b.  \(2\) deprived the animal of its natural liberty

                c.  \(3\) brought the animal within his certain control

            2.  [Majority Test]{.underline}: someone is deemed to
                possess a wild animal if he satisfies either the
                "Hunter-test" or the "Trapper-test":

                a.  [Hunter Test]{.underline} -- if the hunter both (1)
                    mortally wounds the animal and (2) doesn't abandon
                    pursuit

                    i.  Post did not mortally wound the Fox, so he has
                        no right to it

                b.  [Trapper Test]{.underline} -- if the trapper, via
                    nets or other means of interception, traps the
                    animal so as to deprive it of natural liberty and
                    render escape impossible

                    i.  Pearson successfully trapped the animal, so he
                        has rights to it

                    ii. Trapper test is likely dicta

        ii. Dissent -- incentives for fox eradication: foxes are pests;
            their elimination is a public benefit; Fox should go to
            Post, who was hunting foxes

            1.  [Livingston Test]{.underline} (easier to satisfy but
                less certain) -- property in wild animals can be
                acquired without physically grabbing the animal, without
                bodily touch, if the pursuer has:

                a.  \(1\) shown he intends to convert the animal to his
                    own use, AND

                b.  \(2\) animal is either within reach of the pursuer
                    or the pursuer has a reasonable prospect of taking
                    it

            2.  Institutional recommendation -- consider customs of
                sportsmen; don't employ the speculation of philosophers
                but rather the practical experience and customs ppl rely
                on

        iii. Full answer on Exam will discuss both majority and dissent
             rules

        iv. Case reflects a clash between two social strata: deeply
            rooted old money that had fallen on somewhat hard times
            (Pierson, claiming special privileges in using the Commons
            by virtue of his social status) and newcomer, nouveau riche
            (Post, challenging the special privileges claimed by those
            like Pierson's family by hunting on the Commons without
            getting permission)

    b.  **Custom** **exception** -- *custom can sometimes determine
        first possession where it is fairer and people have knowledge of
        custom over the law.* ***Ghen v. Rich*** (Mass. 1881) -- Custom
        in Cape Cod was that a person who finds a killed fin-back whale
        sends word, and the whaler who killed the whale sends someone to
        pay small fee to finder. Ghen (π-whaler) killed a fin-back
        whale; Ellis found the whale and, contrary to custom, sold it at
        auction to Rich (∆), who harvested the blubber and oil from the
        whale carcass. In ruling for π-whaler, the court favors custom.

        i.  Different technological contexts can lead to different
            results when you're applying different principles, and thus
            different rules being adopted (i.e., recall the speed of
            fin-back whales):

            1.  If the *Pierson*-majority test is applied the result is
                ambiguous since we don't know what constitutes
                abandoning pursuit (did Ghen need to wait in sea until
                whale resurfaced?)

            2.  If the *Pierson*-dissent test is applied, the result is
                also ambiguous since it's unclear whether Ghen had a
                "reasonable prospect of taking it" (would Ghen find it
                when it resurfaced?)

        ii. Court reaches opposite result of *Pierson* (i.e., guy who
            actually secured animal doesn't get it)

            1.  Legal authority for the result is custom: long-standing
                custom in Cape Cod supports Ghen's right of possession.
                Court is concerned with:

                a.  Consistency -- custom prevails but is consistent
                    with whaling case law anyway

                b.  Low stakes -- custom is limited in application,
                    affecting few ppl

                c.  Long acquiescence to rule, which works well in
                    practice (stands test of time)

                d.  Incentives -- sustaining custom is necessary for
                    whaling industry to persist

                e.  Fairness -- providing the finder's fee is reasonable

    c.  Potential problems with using custom to determine law:

        i.  Custom is often developed by powerful yet limited parochial
            group (i.e., good for the group but not necessarily socially
            optimal) (i.e., Pierson's family having rights to the
            Commons is good for social elite but not good for everybody
            else)

        ii. Customs change so it's not always easy to say whether new or
            old custom should be used

        iii. Judges aren't necessarily best at determining what is
             custom

        iv. If custom sometimes prevails over law, how can people know
            when that is?

    d.  Prof Lee's conclusion on custom: custom can be good, bad, or
        neither, depending on the circumstances

***D. Open Access and the Commons (Downside to first possession)***

1.  Disadvantage of first-in-time rule: it can create wasteful
    competitions to be first. If the rewards go to whomever is first,
    then then there is a strong incentive to be first, which can lead to
    overexploitation of resources.

2.  **Commons** -- Nobody has the right to the land, so nobody has the
    right to exclude. This leads to the "tragedy of the commons."

    a.  **Tragedy of the Commons** = overutilization of resources

        i.  Either depletion of the resources of commons or filling up
            the commons with junk

        ii. Leads to degradation of the environment whenever many
            individuals use a scarce resource in common.

        iii. Example: animals grazing in shared open field will lead to
             overgrazing; net result is people are not going to invest
             in planting more grass and they're not going to refrain
             from eating the grass that's out there. End result is all
             the grass is gone and there's a barren field.

        iv. Example: dumping of waste (factories spewing GHG emissions;
            dumped plastic in oceans)

    b.  **Solutions to tragedy of commons**

        i.  Institution of property can be viewed as a mechanism for
            solving the tragedy of the commons by causing people to
            internalize both the costs and benefits of their choices;
            this leads to more efficient decisions, thereby maximizing
            the total amount of wealth in society

        ii. Private property -- solve tragedy by granting exclusive
            rights to certain things. Internalization: owners reap
            benefits of choices and suffer consequences too (incentives
            for efficiency)

            1.  Problems: can be expensive (have to pay for insurance,
                monitoring, fences, etc.); localization (i.e., what
                happens if you're patch gets no rain?)

        iii. Government regulation -- state control; have Gov't sort out
             the issues. Central planner can try to figure out the
             optimal usage for a common resource and have everyone
             comply.

             1.  Problems: central planners are prone to error (i.e.,
                 lack info or poor at aggregating specialized info) and
                 it is inherently coercive (i.e., people like their
                 freedom)

        iv. "Best" solution -- varies upon the problem (could be one,
            the other, neither, or both)

            1.  No one-size fits all solution on how to deal with a
                resource

            2.  One must figure out in individual cases the optimal,
                institutional arrangement for governing allocation and
                management of that resource

    c.  **Anti-commons Problem** = underutilization of the resource;
        private ownership rights are too broadly dispersed can in
        practice make efficient use of a resource impossible. Dividing
        the commons into too many fractional properties where too many
        people have the right to exclude and consequently no one is able
        to use the resource

        i.  Inefficient underutilization of valuable resources (i.e.,
            nobody profiting from "Scrubs" b/c of too many having
            property rights to parts of it)

        ii. Achieving unanimity/consensus if difficult. If every person
            gets a veto on productive use, it will be impossible to make
            decisions and productively use the land/resource (i.e.,
            trying to get 5 friends to decide on a move)

**II. Water Rights**

***A. Overview***

1.  Water is a valuable resource and will become increasingly valuable
    as the climate changes part of the world become drier

2.  Riparian rights travel with the land and cannot be severed (whoever
    owns the land owns the water rights)

3.  A **riparian** owner is someone who owns land that abuts a water
    course.

4.  Water rights are appurtenant to the land.

***B. Classifications of water***

1.  Surface water / Subsurface water

2.  **Defined channel** (stream, brook, lake, etc.; valuable) /
    **Diffuse water** (flood water, a pest to be eradicated)

***C. Common Enemy Doctrine***

1.  Every landowner has a right to use self-help to prevent surface
    water (i.e., during a flood) from invading their land. They can
    build barriers that expel the water even if that causes damaging
    flooding to other properties. However, the right is reciprocal: the
    neighbors can do the same and the parties cannot sue each other.

    a.  Courts have implemented a reasonableness limitation on such
        practices

***D. Four Approaches to Allocating Water Rights (reflecting competing
fundamental principles of the just allocation of property rights in
general; which principle seems right may vary depending on
circumstances)***

1.  **Natural Flow** -- Each property owner can remove water from a
    watercourse, but only to the extent that doing so does not disrupt
    the natural flow of that water. Take as much as you like up until
    you disrupt the natural flow at which point you must stop. Riparian
    owners upstream cannot prevent riparian owners downstream from
    accessing the water. Any disturbance of the natural flow requires
    consent. Effectively prohibits using large amounts of water.

    a.  **Just allocation:** Equal rights, every riparian owner gets to
        enjoy the same amount of water flow (i.e., we're allocating
        property rights in a way such that everyone gets the same)

    b.  Prevents many possible uses of water since no one can disrupt
        the natural flow; thus, almost all of the water must be allowed
        to run into the sea unused.

        i.  To use more water, owner must get permission from everybody
            downstream (anti-commons). Leads to high transaction costs.
            Lots of people; lots of time; "Holdout" problem.

    c.  Discussed and rejected in *Evans v. Merriwether*; never really
        caught on in U.S. law

2.  **Reasonable Use** -- A riparian owner can divert water for their
    own use **so long as it is reasonable** (i.e., socially valuable). A
    **court determines what is reasonable**.

    a.  **Just allocation:** promotes allocating resources to socially
        valuable, "reasonable" uses; promotes "reasonableness" *as
        determined by a court/legal system*

    b.  Advantages: invokes reasonableness, supports more productive
        uses than natural flow approach

    c.  Problems: what is reasonable? This is ambiguous / uncertain

        i.  Natural wants over artificial resources (what is artificial
            can change over time)

        ii. Becomes difficult to know over time what your rights are
            since what used to be "reasonable" might no longer be
            "reasonable;" this makes planning difficult

        iii. If a new use arises, one must go to court to find out if
             it's "reasonable"

    d.  The US Eastern States (and other states with abundances of
        water) follow the reasonable use theory

    e.  ***Evans v. Merriweather*** (Ill. 1842) -- After drought reduced
        available water, Evans (upstream) built a dam to get more water
        for steam mill, which diverted all water from Merriweather's
        steam mill (after he purchased from Smith & Baker, who were
        making steam first). Court considers whether an upstream
        riparian landowner can divert stream water away from a
        downstream riparian landowner, if the diversion is for
        "nonessential" activities.

        i.  First possession does not straightforwardly solve the
            problem since Evans was using water for his mill before
            Baker but Baker purchased land from people using water
            before Evans (i.e., transfer rights); moreover, each water
            molecule technically passes through Evans' land first

        ii. Court rules that Evans, as upstream owner, wrongfully
            obstructed the stream from Merriweather.

        iii. Rule: An upstream riparian owner may only divert water if
             it is for natural "essential" wants. For artificial uses, a
             riparian owner has the right to divert the water if **(1)**
             reasonable and **(2)** does not injure any other owner more
             than necessary to accomplish the reasonable use.

             1.  Rule doesn't prohibit all uses without permission, just
                 those which are unreasonable or involve excessive
                 injury to other owners

        iv. **Natural/essential** uses are absolutely necessary (i.e.,
            drinking water, water for household uses)

        v.  **Artificial/nonessential** uses merely increase comfort or
            prosperity

        vi. Natural wants always trump artificial wants

            1.  Upstream user can wholly use a stream to satisfy natural
                wants if the downstream wants are entirely artificial

            2.  If the upstream use is artificial and the downstream use
                is natural, then the downstream use will take priority

            3.  **When artificial uses are competing (like here),
                neither owner has the right to use all the water.** All
                have the right to participate in its benefits.

                a.  In this case, there's no universal rule; instead,
                    it's left up to the jury to decide whether the ∆
                    "has used more than his just proportion"

3.  **First Appropriation** -- whoever gets to the water first for a
    beneficial purpose has property rights

    a.  **Advantages** -- bright line rule, promotes certainty (identity
        of who was first is typically stable)

    b.  **Problems** -- not always easy to determine who was first
        (i.e., certainty can be illusory); someone who was first
        appropriator may not be using the water efficiently (i.e.,
        misuse of water). Exactly what is a "beneficial use" might be
        ambiguous.

    c.  Dry, Western US states follow the first appropriation approach

    d.  **Just allocation:** promotes economic development by rewarding
        initiative and promoting certainty

    e.  ***Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Co.*** (CO 1882) -- Left Hand Ditch
        Co. (π), on upstream land, diverted water from creek to irrigate
        its lands; built a dam to do it; the dam didn't divert all the
        water, the rest flowed downstream. Coffin (∆) later acquired
        downstream land; also uses stream water to irrigate his land.
        During water shortage, not enough water for both to irrigate
        land, so ∆ destroyed π's dam; π sues.

        i.  Upstream possessor wins; the dam was permissible.

        ii. Opposite result of *Evans v. Merriweather* despite seemingly
            similar set of facts

        iii. The court holds that the right to water by first
             appropriation is the right rule. This rule has existed from
             the time of first appropriations in CO; goal to incentivize
             productive use of water.

             1.  Court explains that in **Western states**, like CO, the
                 climate is dry and arid; artificial irrigation for
                 agriculture is absolutely necessary. Public policy in
                 CO, therefore, has encouraged the diversion of water
                 for agriculture.

             2.  When the nature of the resource is different, it may
                 make sense for the law of property governing that
                 resource to be different; what the law is may depend on
                 the kind of thing that we're talking about.

             3.  Certainty/Predictability -- Court is concerned about
                 the need to rely on the established rule; adaptations
                 to a change in law would be quite expensive: if
                 everyone expects things to be one way, and they're
                 suddenly changed, all sorts of plans go out the window.

             4.  Imperative necessity requires that CO not follow the
                 reasonable use riparian rule

        iv. **RULE**: In western states, like CO, the first appropriator
            of water from a natural stream for a beneficial purpose has
            a right to the water as large as the extent of such first
            appropriation, even if first appropriation leaves no water
            for others. Three elements to the rule:

            1.  **(1)** First appropriator -- person who got there first

            2.  **(2)** The use of the water has to be for a beneficial
                purpose

            3.  **(3)** The scope of rights is as large as the extent of
                such first appropriation

        v.  **Not included in the rule**:

            1.  Somebody comes along second is of course not the first
                appropriator

            2.  First appropriator who is not making beneficial use of
                water (here, the court says diverting the water from a
                stream fairly far away qualified as a beneficial
                purpose; sometimes the most fertile land is far from the
                major water courses); note that "beneficial use" is not
                always clear but seems to read expansively, inclusively,
                by the court.

            3.  HYPO: First appropriator begins using 1,000 gallons per
                day to irrigate a flower bed. Second appropriator
                downstream comes along later and starts using left over
                water. Then first appropriator wants to increase use to
                2,000 gallons per day, but in so doing, there is no
                water left for the downstream user.

                a.  This would not be allowed under *Coffin* since the
                    rights extend only to what you are first using for a
                    beneficial purpose, which was 1,000 gallons per day.
                    The extra thousand weren't first used for a
                    beneficial purpose, so rights don't extend.

4.  ***Correlative Rights*** -- rights that correlate from one thing to
    another. Basic idea is that the scope of one's rights to a
    particular resource might depend on the scope of your ownership to
    some other resource. The rights of the first resource correlate to
    the rights of the other resource. How much one owns of something
    depends on how much one owns of something else.

    a.  One way this shows up in the context of water (as well as oil)
        is in subsurface resources. One way to allocate rights to this
        underground pool is to assign a proportion of the subsurface
        resource that corresponds to one's above surface landownership.
        (i.e., if you own 32% of the land above the pool, then you are
        entitled to 32% of whatever is in the pool).

    b.  **Just allocation** of a given resource is based on its
        relationship to other allocations that are themselves generally
        accepted as just/fair. You're entitled to x, therefore you must
        be entitled to y.

    c.  Advantages: proportionality feels fair to owner, plausible,
        relatively easy to determine

    d.  Disadvantages: ignores social utility

**III. Ad Coelum Rule, Sequential Possession, Nemo Dat**

***A. Ad Coelum Rule: "to whoever has the land, his also is all the way
up to the heavens and down to the depths"***

1.  If you own land, you own everything below your land down to the
    center of the earth, and everything above your land to the end of
    the universe.

2.  Rule is an example of **correlative rights principle**: the extent
    of your ownership of the airspace and subsurface depends on how much
    of the surface you own

3.  Raises potential policy concerns if the person who's on the surface
    has no ability to actually access any of the airspace or subsurface.
    Seems odd for a person to own stuff they can't do anything with.

4.  ***Edwards v. Sims*** (KY, 1929) -- Edwards owned land that has a
    cave under it, including the entrance to the cave. Edwards created a
    lucrative sightseeing business for cave tourists. Part of the cave
    was allegedly under a portion of Lee's, his neighbor's, property.
    Lee filed suit seeking an injunction to prevent Edwards from using
    the portion of the cave beneath his land, and Judge Sims ordered a
    survey of the cave to determine what portion of the cave is under
    Lee's property. Edwards sought a writ of prohibition against Sims to
    prevent the survey.

    a.  Majority opinion: survey can continue; hews quite closely to
        existing doctrine concerning mines. Inspection of the cave is
        allowed because of the *ad coelum* rule. Not too much policy.

    b.  Dissent: the rule should instead be that one owns everything
        above or below the land that **(1)** can be subjected to one's
        control and **(2)** one can use for his benefit. Otherwise,
        owners should have no right to what's above or below their
        surface land.

        i.  Lee had no way to benefit from or even enter the cave which
            was 300 feet below his property.

        ii. Since Edwards owned the entrance and he made the cave what
            it was, he should own the entire cave.

    c.  Prof. Lee notes that: If Lee is given property rights to the
        cave, the likelihood is that Edwards purchases rights from Lee,
        and the cave remains in operation, but Lee would be richer and
        Edwards poorer. If Edwards is deemed the full owner, Lee
        unlikely to pay Edwards not to go under land, so Edwards again
        ends up with the full cave. *Regardless of how the court rules,
        Edward ends up with the cave*. The only difference is how much
        money Edwards and Lee end up with.

***B. Sequential Possession: acquisition of things that already are
owned. Who owns property when you have a series of people who possess it
at different times, each of whom is claiming to own the property?***

1.  Finders of property: the person who has the thing isn't the first
    possessor and, at best, is the second possessor

2.  If the link between A's ownership and B's ownership is voluntary
    transfer (purchase, gift), one can understand B's ownership. But
    what is the link is something different? Who then should prevail
    between A and B if they disagree over who should own the property?

    a.  ***Armory v. Delamirie*** (KB 1722) -- **[Finder and a
        Converter]{.underline}**. *Finder has superior rights against
        all except the true owner*. True owner, followed by a finder,
        followed by a converter. π, a chimney sweeper boy, found a jewel
        while cleaning a chimney and brought it to ∆, a jeweler. An
        apprentice of jeweler took the jewel and pretends to go weigh
        it, instead removes the jewels, and tells the plaintiff it is
        not worth much. Does not return the jewels.

        i.  The court held that **a finder of property has rights that
            are good against everyone except the true owner**.

            1.  **Information Forcing Rule**: When there is an info
                asymmetry between the parties, where one party is likely
                to have info that's relevant to resolving the dispute
                and the other party lacks the info, court might provide
                incentive to party that has info to bring it court by
                setting up a default presumption, one that is very
                unpleasant, for the party that has the info, that can be
                overcome by providing info.

            2.  The court could not determine the value of the jewel so
                it used an information forcing rule that said unless the
                ∆ provides the value of the jewel, the court will assume
                the jewel was the most expensive jewel.

    b.  ***Clark v. Maloney*** (Del. 1840) -- **[Two
        Finders]{.underline}**. *When lost property is found by two
        different finders, the first finder has superior title over the
        second finder*. π found 10 pine logs in a river after a great
        freshet (i.e., a great rush of water) and tied them to a stake.
        ∆ claims that he found the logs upstream, claiming they must
        have come loose. π sued ∆.

        i.  Court says π must show he owned property and that ∆
            converted property to his own use. Second part is
            straightforward since ∆ has the property.

        ii. Court invokes a rule: **[possession is prima facie evidence
            of property]{.underline}** because it may be rebutted by
            evidence of better title; in the absence of better title, it
            is as effective a supportive title as the most conclusive
            evidence could be.

            1.  Possession creates prima facie evidence that it is
                yours; but

            2.  It can be countered by evidence of better title.

            3.  If there is no counter evidence, possession is very
                strong evidence ownership

        iii. Court concludes: property owner doesn't lose his rights as
             a result of losing the chattel. Whatever rights to the
             chattel they had before they lost it, they continue to have
             even after they lost it. **Losing it doesn't reduce one's
             rights**.

             1.  Thus, the true owner, if he lost something, still has
                 rights good against all the world

             2.  Likewise, **the first finder has a claim against all
                 the world except the rightful owner, and doesn't lose
                 this right to ownership simply by losing an item**.

                 a.  I.e., the first finder lost the property but never
                     lost his rights

                 b.  The second finder is only capable of getting rights
                     that are good against all the world except the true
                     owner and the first finder.

    c.  ***Anderson v. Gouldberg*** (Minn. 1892) -- **[Two
        Converters]{.underline}**. *A converter who unlawfully acquires
        property has a right to retain possession against any subsequent
        converter, but not the original owner*. π chopped down logs on
        someone else's property -- was trespassing -- and then hauled
        them elsewhere to a saw mill where ∆ allegedly took them. True
        owner, followed by a converter, followed by another converter.

        i.  Court says: possession is good title against all the world
            except those having better title.

        ii. Anyone who obtains possession of property, even if by
            committing a tort, has a right that is good against "a mere
            wrongdoer who is a stranger to the property." In other
            words, π is granted rights to the logs, even though he
            obtained them illegally by trespassing since the subsequent
            was converter came afterward and also obtained them by
            wrongdoing.

        iii. **[Policy rationale:]{.underline}** if we don't give rights
             to the first converter, then there would be an everlasting
             cycle of people stealing each other's property.

             1.  Court is worried about the potential for violence;
                 wants a rule that limits conflict. If we give rights to
                 the person who simply possesses it now, then there's a
                 strong incentive to do so by violence.

        iv. Note: Casebook notes Russell v. Hill (NC 1899) which came to
            the opposite result, so this area of the law might actually
            be up in the air.

    d.  **Jus Tertii**: "right of the third" -- You can't invoke a 3^rd^
        party's superior rights to defend your own possession.

        i.  A suit to recover property (or damages for its loss) cannot
            be defeated by showing that someone else, a 3^rd^ party, has
            title that is superior to either of the parties to the suit.

        ii. If A possessed property and B later acquires it without A's
            permission, and then A sues, B cannot raise as a defense
            that "C has a better right then either of us, so I get to
            keep it."

        iii. **A claim cannot be defeated by showing that a third party
             owns the property**

        iv. Three justifications for why the defense doesn't exist:

            1.  [Substantive]{.underline}: Fairness -- ∆ wrongfully
                interfered with π's possession and should not get away
                with it just because there is a 3^rd^ party with an even
                better right

            2.  [Procedural]{.underline}: Availability of information --
                Courts depend on information from parties in court, so
                no way to evaluate the credibility of a 3^rd^ party who
                isn't in court.

            3.  [Policy]{.underline}: Giving the first finder rights
                over everyone except the true owner helps reduce
                disputes and promotes peaceful possession.

    e.  ***Nemo Dat***: "nobody gives what he doesn't have" -- if A
        transfers ownership of some property to B, what B owns is
        limited to what A had. If A shared property with C, what he's
        given to B is merely the right to shared ownership with C. If A
        owns nothing at all but purports to sell it to B, B ends up with
        nothing.

        i.  Transferee's rights derive from the transferor; you only own
            what the previous owner owned

        ii. **[First in time, first in right / Prior in time, prior in
            right]{.underline}** -- further implication of Nemo Dat
            principle: if A sells "black acre" (used in the study of
            property for hypotheticals) to B and then A sells black acre
            to C, B gets black acre, C gets nothing. Once A had sold the
            property to B, he had nothing left to sell to C.

**IV. Adverse Possession**

***A. Overview: General idea is that if a person trespasses for long
enough, he will gain the property rights and become the true owner***

1.  Under certain circumstances, the law says that the adverse
    possessor's right is good even against the true owner.

2.  Adverse possessor comes to own property not in spite of his
    wrongdoing but because of his wrongdoing

***B. Rationales for adverse possession***

1.  The cost of proving and disproving claims to title becomes more
    difficult over time

2.  Reliance Interests -- The longer an adverse possessor holds onto the
    land the more they come to rely on it and develop a long-standing
    interest in it

    a.  "endowment effect" -- people value things they were given for
        free more than things they need to buy

    b.  "loss aversion" -- depriving someone of something is more
        painful than giving someone something they don't already have.

    c.  "personhood" -- is tied up in property. Property has meaning for
        individuals beyond monetary value. (i.e., one's childhood home
        or the value of a wedding ring for a jeweler versus a married
        person).

3.  Favoring active property users -- discourages true owners from
    sleeping on their rights

    a.  We see this idea repeatedly in American property law doctrines

    b.  Standard critique is conservation; keeping land as wilderness is
        environmentally beneficial

        i.  However, the counter to the critique is you just need to
            monitor it, not use it per se

4.  Reduces transaction costs -- it is sometimes difficult to determine
    title for assets that last a long time, like land

    a.  "Deed in the attic problem"

    b.  Closely related to the first reason

***C. Problems with adverse possession***

1.  Property owners should be free to use their land as they please

2.  The adverse possessor is not always improving the land

3.  Fairness considerations -- The law should not reward trespassers

4.  There are other ways to deal with unused lands

***D. Elements of Adverse Possession***

1.  **[Actual Possession]{.underline}**: need to actually possess the
    property (i.e., intent and control)

    a.  Does *not* qualify as actual possession

        i.  Merely telling everybody you own the property without ever
            physically possessing it

        ii. Occupying only part of the property (i.e., if there's a
            50-acre lot and you physically occupy 2 acres of it;
            depending on the circumstances and jurisdiction, maybe you
            adversely possess 2 of the 50 acres, but not all 50)

2.  **[Exclusive]{.underline}**: cannot share possession with anyone
    else (doesn't mean that others can't use it---i.e., inviting friends
    over for a party), esp. the true owner.

    a.  Two requirements:

        i.  \(1\) evinced an intention to possess the land to the
            exclusion of everyone else's claims

        ii. \(2\) conduct has given an unequivocal indication that the
            adverse possessor was exercising the dominion of a sole
            owner (i.e., controlling the property himself)

3.  **[Open and Notorious]{.underline}**: owner should have been aware
    and AP needs to make it obvious to owner

    a.  Ensures the true owner had actual or constructive (you are
        deemed to have received notice legally; should've known even if
        you didn't actually know) notice of the adverse possession

    b.  Possession was visible and widely known

4.  **[Continuous]{.underline}**: continuous not continual

5.  **[Adverse/Hostile under a claim of right or color of
    title]{.underline}**: claim of right is AP's mental state (i.e., I
    think I own the land); and Color of Title means you have a defective
    deed to the land (some jurisdictions this is required or beneficial,
    but not all)

    a.  Claim of Right: 3 possibilities

        i.  [Good Faith]{.underline}: reasonably believed he had a right
            to be there (NY uses this rule).

            1.  Typically, not explicitly required (like it is in
                *Carpenter v. Ruperto*, an outlier); but courts do
                implicitly care about it so it's a point in your favor

        ii. [Bad Faith]{.underline}: Maine Rule (rarely) used; followed
            by no one

        iii. [Don't care about faith]{.underline}: Conn. Rule (favored
             by academics)

    b.  Color of title: you have a deed but it's defective

        i.  In some jurisdictions possessing under color of title is
            advantageous since the statute of limitations may run more
            quickly; you may have to be on the property for a shorter
            period of time before you get claim the property via adverse
            possession.

        ii. In some jurisdictions, actually having color of title and
            possessing part of the land may be sufficient to be deemed
            to have constructive possession of all the land.

        iii. In some jurisdictions, if you have a defective deed to a
             50-acre property and have been only using 2 acres of that
             property, you get all 50 acres.

             1.  In NY, the law explicitly defers to the local custom to
                 determine scope of property rights

    c.  Depends on the jurisdiction if you use claim of right or color
        of title

    d.  Adverse/Hostile means owner has not given you permission to be
        there.

        i.  If owner has granted permission, you can't get title via
            adverse possession (i.e., landlord rents you an apartment).

6.  **[Statutorily Required Time Period]{.underline}**: possessed the
    property for the statutorily required period of time.

    a.  Varies by jurisdiction; must look to the specific statute.

    b.  It is possible the clock is suspended/paused if the owner is
        suffering from a disability that existed at the time the adverse
        possessor entered.

    c.  If owner is in a coma when adverse possession starts, then the
        clock is paused until owner comes out of the coma; if adverse
        possession has persisted for some time and then the owner enters
        a coma, that doesn't stop the clock from running.

***E. Adverse Possession in Case Law***

1.  ***Scott v. Anderson-Tully Co.*** (Miss. 2015) -- **[Open and
    Notorious element]{.underline}**. π (Scott) owned land. ∆
    (Anderson-Tulley) removed timber from the land. π sued ∆ for the
    price of the timber. ∆ argued in defense that it wasn't the π's
    timber anymore because the land it was on no longer belonged to the
    π: ∆ had marked the purported property line years earlier, painting
    a fence blue to distinguish the property line and had been using the
    disputed 20 acres for decades.

    a.  Court rules for ∆, saying he is an adverse possessor of the
        land. ∆ met all the elements of adverse possession. The case
        hinged on two elements of the adverse possession rule: the
        element of "open and notorious" and the statutory amount of
        time. Since ∆ met both these elements as well as the others, he
        became the adverse possessor.

        i.  [Open and notorious]{.underline} -- possession was visible
            b/c ppl had seen the blue paint marking the property line
            (open); possession was widely known in the community
            (notorious)

    b.  Rule: To constitute adverse possession, there must be actual
        possession that is uninterrupted, open and notorious, hostile
        and exclusive, and under a claim of right made in good faith for
        the statutory period of time.

        i.  [Peaceful possession]{.underline}, used in the case, is not
            required in every jurisdiction

            1.  No one complained about the line

            2.  Nobody interfered with the use

    c.  Acts required to establish a claim of adverse possession may
        vary with the characteristics of the land

        i.  Acts that are insufficient for developed/improved land, may
            be sufficient of unimproved land

2.  ***Howard v. Kunto*** (Wash. 1970) -- **[Continuous
    Element]{.underline}**. There were four lots, A, B, C, and D. Two of
    the lots, A and D, were unimproved (vacant lots). The other two
    lots, B and C, were improved (had structures/houses on them). Lot B
    was occupied by Kunto, lot C was occupied by Moyer, lot D was
    occupied by Howard. Each occupant had a title, a deed, that said
    they owned the property but there was a glitch in the making of the
    deeds; due to an administrative screwup everybody ended up with the
    deed to the property next door. Kunto (occupying lot B) had a title
    to A; Moyer (occupying lot C) had the deed to B; Howard (occupying
    lot D), had the deed to C. Moyer and Howard entered into a deal to
    swap deeds: Moyers end up with the deed for C, which they were
    occupying; Howard ends up with deed to B, occupied by Kunto. Howard
    would prefer lot B over lot D since lot B is improved. Howard sues
    Kunto for lot B. Kunto invokes adverse possession to maintain
    occupancy of lot B.

    a.  The title was granted to Kunto through adverse possession.

    b.  Case hinged on the [continuity element]{.underline} of adverse
        possession

        i.  Kunto had occupied house during summer for 1-year (less than
            statutory requirement)

            1.  Summer occupancy -- good enough to satisfy continuity in
                this case because the property was summer vacation
                property; people who own this kind of property occupy it
                during the summer; [this is ordinary use of this type of
                property]{.underline}

            2.  1-year -- ok because "**tacking**" is allowed, meaning
                that it doesn't matter that Kunto's lived there for just
                a year. Even if no single individual adverse possessor
                has owned the property for the statutory amount of time,
                you can "tack" together past adverse possessors' time to
                satisfy the requirement.

                a.  **Tacking** is ok so long as the requirement of
                    **privity** is satisfied (i.e., an adequate
                    connection b/t the current adverse possessor and
                    previous adverse possessor). One cannot simply
                    trespass for a week; rather privity requires
                    something like a deed, even if the deed is
                    technically defective, or a "**reasonable
                    connection**."

                    i.  Here Kunto did not have a defective deed but
                        rather the wrong deed, so the court says there
                        was a **"reasonable connection," raising claim
                        of right above the wrongdoer or trespasser**

    c.  Case serves as an example of how adverse possession can be used
        to correct mistakes

3.  ***Carpenter v. Ruperto*** (Iowa, 1982) -- Adverse possessor, π,
    knew that she was adversely possessing a lot north of her property.
    Nevertheless, she went ahead and improved it. Previously, the lot
    had been used to store junk; π testified that she was in part
    motivated to improve it by the presence of rats and other safety
    risks to her children. She grated the land, planted grass, installed
    a propane tank (seemingly beyond her supposed motivation). Dispute
    arose and π brought action to quiet title.

    a.  Court denies π's right to ownership by adverse possession since
        good faith is required (NY uses this rule).

    b.  Straightforward example of an adverse possessor losing for not
        having good faith.

    c.  Outlier case -- it is uncommon, rare, that jurisdictions
        explicitly require good faith.

**V. Ownership of Body Parts**

***A. Overview***

1.  Commodification is based on the idea of taking something that one
    thinks should not be an aspect of market exchange and making it an
    aspect of market exchange

2.  There are moral boundaries to commodification because it becomes
    morally wrong to put a price on certain things.

3.  There is a debate as to whether putting a price on body parts is
    moral.

    a.  13^th^ Amendment illegalizes slavery in the U.S.; should body
        parts be an element of market exchange?

***B. Moore v. Regents of the Univ. of California*** (Cal. 1990) --
Moore was diagnosed with leukemia; UCLA Doctor recommended his spleen be
removed. Moore then signed a consent form. Dr. didn't disclose that
Moore's spleen had certain unusual characteristics and that he planned
to do research on white blood cells taken from spleen; the unusual
characteristics of the spleen would make the research easier. Dr.
created a new cell line based on the white blood cells and got a patent
on the new line. UCLA then sold access to the materials and research,
\$440k for three years, with an estimated market potential of \$3B/year.
Moore found out about the money and sued Dr., the other scientists, and
UCLA, including a claim for conversion (taking property without the
owner's consent and converting it to the defendant's use).

1.  Court affirms decision: Moore did not have property rights to his
    spleen after voluntary removal, therefore he did not have rights to
    any income stream that might be derived from the spleen.

    a.  **Part I: There is no COA under existing Cal. tort law**

        i.  Conversion requires that there be actual interference with
            either (1) ownership or (2) right of possession (Note:
            ownership and possession are not the same (i.e., landlord
            owns property during term of lease with no right to possess
            it while tenant possesses with no right to own)

            1.  Didn't own the spleen

                a.  Cal. statutes drastically limit patients continuing
                    interest in cells removed from their bodies.

            2.  No right of possession since he didn't want it back (not
                intent to possess or control)

        ii. Patients have a right to veto scientific use b/c they have
            right not to be treated by physicians' whose research they
            disapprove of; informed consent rules facilitate this.

            1.  Property rights aren't necessary here, so long as there
                is informed consent based on adequate disclosure

        iii. Precedent -- no earlier cases say Moore has a right to the
             spleen.

    b.  **Part II: Law should not be extended to provide such a COA**

        i.  Research has high social value and want to avoid high
            information costs that would discourage research

            1.  **Balancing policy considerations**

                a.  Patient's autonomy (ability to control what happens
                    to body)

                b.  Researchers' need to be secure from liability when
                    they're doing research on biomedical material

                c.  On balance, the cancer research here favored the
                    researchers

                    i.  Moore himself is incapable of doing anything
                        beneficial with diseased spleen

        ii. Autonomy interest can be protected anyway by disclosure laws
            requiring informed consent and adequate disclosure (patient
            can then choose to not have this Dr.)

        iii. Legislature is best fit to make this decision (because of
             policy considerations)

             1.  Who's best situated to decide what the law should be?
                 Similar idea to dissent in *Pierson* and majority in
                 *Ghen*

    c.  Dissent -- we don't need to extend conversion liability; Moore
        may already have a property right. The mere fact that biomedical
        waste disposal law places restrictions on what Moore can do with
        bodily tissue doesn't entail that he doesn't have a remaining
        property right because property rights often come with
        restrictions.

        i.  Property ownership can still exist with severe restrictions

        ii. i.e., sometimes personal property can be sold but not given
            away; sometimes it can be given away but not sold

    d.  Issues about body parts reflect a broader fundamental question
        about the scope of property law in general

**[The Right to Exclude]{.underline}**

**I. Trespass and The Right to Exclude**

***A. Overview***

1.  Trespass to land is the right to exclude others from your property.
    The right is strong and does not have to be reasonable. Trespassing
    consists of doing any of the following without lawful
    justification: (1) entering land in the possession of another; (2)
    remaining on the land; or (3) placing or projecting any object onto
    it.

2.  Property/ownership is a collection of rights. One of the central
    rights of ownership is the **right to exclude others** from
    occupying or using your property without your permission.

***B. Trespass to Land***

1.  ***Jacque v. Steenberg Homes*** (Wisc. 1997) -- Steenberg wanted to
    cut across the Jacques' land to deliver a mobile home. The only
    other road they could take to deliver the home was covered in snow
    and had a sharp turn that requires additional equipment, the use of
    which would be dangerous. Despite Steenberg's offer to pay to cut
    across the property, the Jacques repeatedly denied Steenberg
    permission; Steenberg did it anyway. Trial court awards \$1 in
    nominal compensatory damages and \$100k in punitive damages.

    a.  Note: Jacques were worried about adverse possession, which
        didn't make sense because:

        i.  If they grant permission, AP is not possible

        ii. Whatever the statutory time limit is, it's certainly longer
            than a day

    b.  Upper court says:

        i.  When nominal damages are awarded for an intentional trespass
            to land, punitive damages may also be awarded.

            1.  NOTE: ***State Farm v. Campbell*** (2003) -- USSC held
                that punitive damages that are greater than 9 times
                compensatory damages---while not necessarily
                suspect---are presumptively suspect. If this case had
                been litigated a decade later, it likely would have been
                decided differently.

        ii. Court rejects the argument that, if the purpose of punitive
            damages is deterrence, there is no great societal interest
            in deterring conduct that isn't harmful.

            1.  Court says this is inappropriate in the context of
                intentional torts

        iii. Cites English case: if Steenberg homes won't act in civil
             manner "like a gentleman" then heavy damages are required
             to deter it.

             1.  Professor notes: did the Jacques act like gentlemen?
                 Should we deter this behavior too?

                 a.  Perhaps the law should instead promote neighborly
                     accommodation

        iv. Court says: the real harm was to the loss to the right to
            exclude

    c.  This case is on page 1 of the casebook because it establishes
        from the outset that **property owners have a very strong right
        to exclude**.

    d.  Prof Lee says: at a policy level it could be desirable to have a
        reasonableness requirement to the right to exclude. To what
        extent should we protect unreasonable property owners?

    e.  In some cases, a **necessity defense is available** if
        trespassed needed to cross in an emergency.

2.  **Ad Coelum Expectation**: *The right to exclude does not extend
    upward indefinitely; but only to as much airspace as the landowner
    is actually using, and only so long as he's using it. (Landowner
    still has rights to prohibit uses of the airspace that interfere
    with the owner's use of the surface).*

    a.  ***Hinman v. Pacific Air Transport*** (9th Cir. 1936) -- Pacific
        Air would fly aircraft above Hinman's property, at an altitude
        below 100 ft., and as low as 5 ft. Hinman sought an injunction
        for up to 150 feet above his property and significant damages,
        arguing that this was a trespass based on ad coelum.

        i.  Court ruled that this was not a trespass since ad coelum was
            never the law.

            1.  The essence of property is dominion. Therefore, if
                property actually belongs to someone, he must be capable
                of having exclusive possession. Air and sea are
                incapable of private ownership except to the extent that
                they can actually be used.

                a.  Recall dissent in *Edwards v. Sims* said the same
                    thing

            2.  Based on ***Jacque v. Steenberg***, he should have the
                right to exclude even if there are no damages. But ad
                coelum does not protect him because that principle
                really means that **an owner is allowed to use the sky
                above his land only to the extent that he is able
                to**---people cannot own infinity.

                a.  Court does not consider traversing the airspace
                    above Hinamn's land to be a trespass at all.

                b.  Unlike in Jacque, there's no right violation of
                    rights, since there's no right that could have been
                    violated

            3.  Ad coelum **is a right to use property above and below
                land, to the extent that you actually can, without
                interference---but that's it; it's not a general right
                to exclude**.

                a.  Hinman is not using the air that the airport is
                    using.

            4.  **[RULE]{.underline}**: Owner has a valid trespass
                claims for any use of the air above him if the trespass
                is (1) actually injurious to the land below OR (2) if
                the trespass interferes with his possession or
                beneficial use of the land.

                a.  i.e., only if there's an interference with something
                    happening on the land will there be a trespass.

        ii. Prof. Lee notes that if this was considered a trespass then
            the airplane company would have to get permission from every
            single landowner whose land its planes fly over---high
            transaction costs.

        iii. Prof Lee notes: trespass law depends on a prior
             specification of rights the property owners have.

3.  **Continual Trespass**: If it is not a single occurrence and will
    likely persist in the future, equitable relief may be granted:

    a.  Standards for Injunction (equity remedy) (these are elements not
        factors):

        i.  No adequate remedy at law

        ii. Clean hands

        iii. Balance of hardships favors injunction

        iv. Public interest will not be disserved by issuing injunction

    b.  ***Baker v. Howard County Hunt*** (MD 1936) -- In 1924, π
        purchases a farm, eventually raises animals. In 1930 the Hunt
        Club (∆) is formed; π at first not worried b/c he doesn't have
        many rabbits and chickens. In 1933, π starts living permanently
        on the farm, accumulates many rabbits and chickens. ∆'s hunting
        hound repeatedly run across farm, killing rabbits and one-time
        biting π's wife. ∆ had done nothing to stop it. 1936, this is
        still happening, and π shot one of the dogs after it was
        attacking his chickens. π brought an injunction to stop the
        hounds from coming on his property.

        i.  Court states the issue as follows: "whether equity may
            afford injunctive relief against a series of trespasses,
            which, while not continuous, are nevertheless part of a
            single court of conduct which seriously interferes with the
            right of a landowner to the peaceful enjoyment of his
            property."

        ii. Two issues:

            1.  Can Baker get any relief at all? (i.e., was there a
                trespass?) Yes.

                a.  The rights of foxhunters are subordinate to the
                    rights of landowners. (Whether the trespass was made
                    by the hunter or his dogs doesn't make a difference)

            2.  Can Baker get an injunction? (i.e., is equitable relief
                available as a remedy?). Yes.

                a.  Court states **two requirements for equitable
                    relief**:

                    i.  \(1\) **π has no adequate remedy at law** (i.e.,
                        money damages will not be adequate).

                        1.  Money damages are not good enough for two
                            reasons, each of which would have been
                            sufficient on its own.

                            a.  Baker suffered injuries which were
                                intangible and incapable of measurement.
                                (I.e., money damages would be impossible
                                to calculate.

                            b.  ∆s had manifested an intent to persist
                                in their actions (i.e., the trespasses
                                would happen again and they can't simply
                                award money damages every time and keep
                                having lawsuits)

                                i.  Why not punitive damages? (it will
                                    be difficult to calculate how much
                                    would do the trick)

                    ii. \(2\) **π seeking injunctive relief has clean
                        hands** (w/respect to this particular incident).

                        1.  Baker's hands are deemed clean enough even
                            though he shot some of the dogs, which was
                            illegal.

            3.  Easiest solution is simply ordering the trespassing to
                stop by issuing an injunction.

                a.  Keep in mind this wasn't an option in Jacque because
                    the trespass was already completed and wouldn't
                    happen again.

4.  **Continuous Trespass -- Approach 1**: Extreme right to exclude
    enforced over reasonableness and cost considerations.

    a.  ***Pile v. Pedrick*** (PA 1895) -- The foundation of ∆'s factory
        crossed the property line into π's property by 1 and 3/8 in.
        This encroachment was the result of an inaccurate survey and it
        was not discoverable until after the foundation was laid. π
        refused to allow ∆ onto his land to rectify the continuous
        trespass (by chipping away the minor amounts of encroaching
        concrete), but still wanted him to remove the foundation's
        encroachment. π sought in injunction requiring ∆ to drill out
        the foundation from ∆'s side (i.e., tear down the factory wall,
        dig out the foundation on π's side, and then pull back the 1 and
        3.8 inches), which would be enormously expensive.

        i.  Court says there's two possible remedies and π can choose
            between them since there clearly was a trespass.

            1.  Court can treat the foundation as a permanent trespass
                and then require the ∆ to pay damages to compensate for
                the total and permanent effect of the trespass.

            2.  Or, π could require that ∆ remove the offending ends of
                the foundation (i.e., the really expensive option).

                a.  π chooses option 2.

        ii. Appeals court's justification for allowing draconian remedy:
            "We do not see how the court below could have done
            otherwise."

        iii. Casebook alludes to a sort of tacit doctrinal
             justification: while the initial encroachment was
             accidental, once it was discovered, ∆ continued trespass,
             not immediately remedying it, thereby committing an
             intentional trespass. Intentional trespass is forbidden,
             whether or not that exclusion is reasonable, and whether or
             not the trespass is harmless. (*Jacque*)

             1.  Prof Lee says: this doesn't explain why it's injunctive
                 relief rather than just permanent damages (money
                 damages were used in *Jacque*).

             2.  Prof. Lee also suggests that the *Pile* Court doesn't
                 provide much justification to explain its decision.

        iv. Rule of case: a landowner may obtain an injunction to remove
            a portion of a neighbor's encroaching building, regardless
            of whether the encroachment is minor or unintentional.

5.  **Continuous Trespass -- Approach 2**: Deny injunctive relief where
    the encroachment was unintentional and slight, π's use of land is
    not affected, and damage is fairly compensable, and the cost of
    removal is so great as to cause grave hardship. **Balancing
    hardships.**

    a.  ***Golden Press Inc. v. Rylands*** (Col. 1951) -- Encroachment
        of ∆'s building was 2-3.5 inches onto π's property. The
        encroachment was unintentional and π sought injunctive relief.

        i.  Court denies injunctive relief. **Where (1) the ∆'s
            encroachment is unintentional and slight (i.e., done in
            "good faith"), (2) π's land use is not affected, (3) damage
            is minimal, and (4) the cost of removal is so great that it
            causes grave hardship**; **a mandatory injunction may
            properly be denied, with π relegated to compensation and
            damages.**

        ii. In addition to the equitable relief (injunction)
            requirements listed in Baker, court implicitly favors
            another traditional requirement: **balance of the
            hardships**.

            1.  Hardship on π is injunction isn't issued v. hardship on
                ∆ is it is issued. If the balance is too out of whack,
                the court can decline is issue the injunction.

            2.  Court is concerned that the cost of removal is too high.
                **Balance of the equities** here is heavily against
                issuing an injunction.

            3.  π can go back and seek damages in lower court, but
                they're likely to be minimal.

            4.  Even if damages are minimal, they're good enough here
                because this was a **good faith** encroachment where the
                ∆ made an honest mistake.

                a.  "Court should not be party to extortion." (i.e.,
                    **bargaining is done in the shadow of the law**; if
                    court ruled differently, π's could extort ∆s in
                    negotiations taking place after decision is rendered
                    since no matter what the ∆s would have to comply
                    with expensive consequences of the injunction)

                b.  Court also points out that πs were aware of
                    construction but didn't point anything out until
                    well after construction had proceeded

            5.  On the other hand, if the encroachment had been done in
                **bad faith**, equity may well require restoration
                regardless of the expense of removal as compared with
                the damage suffered therefrom.

                a.  i.e., if you did this intentionally, you're stuck
                    with injunction and the massive bill to remove.

6.  **The Mistaken Improver**

    a.  Continuous trespass that doesn't make the trespassed-upon
        property worth less, doesn't harm the victim, but instead makes
        the property better off, more valuable.

    b.  The default rule is that if it's fixed to the land, then it's
        part of the land. The purpose of this rule is to **incentivize
        people to be careful and examine title**. However, if improver
        built in a good faith belief that he or she owned the land, then
        the mistaken improver has equitable remedies.

    c.  ***Producers Lumber v. Olney Building Co.*** (TX 1960) -- In
        1956, π's company bought a lot from ∆'s company; π planted grass
        and trees on it. In 1958, not realizing/recalling that the lot
        now belonged to π, ∆ built a house on it, thereby trespassing.
        When the house was almost complete, later in '58, ∆ learned that
        the lot actually belonged to π. The two tried to work out a
        negotiation but then ∆ had the house demolished out of spite. π
        sues and jury awards damages in the form of what it cost to
        restore the lot to its condition before construction began plus
        modest punitive damages. π appealed, claiming he was entitled to
        more since he also deserved the value of the destroyed house on
        *his* property.

        i.  Court rules in favor of π because ∆ was malicious and didn't
            have clean hands

            1.  Court notes the **traditional rule** that if a builder
                puts a building on someone else's land, without that
                landowner's knowledge and consent, the building becomes
                a fixture, and therefore belongs to the landowner.
                Person who owns the land gets a free house.

                a.  **Fixture** = formerly movable property that stopped
                    being movable because it's now attached to land.
                    Fixtures come to be regarded as part of the land.

                    i.  Includes things that are attached to fixtures
                        themselves (i.e., a chandelier is part of the
                        house you are buying)

                b.  **RULE**: In jurisdiction that follow the
                    traditional rule, the landowner can (1) get an
                    injunction requiring demolition of the building
                    or (2) a declaration that the building belongs to
                    the landowner as a fixture.

            2.  **Exception to traditional rule** if the improver built
                in a good faith, mistaken belief that he owned the land
                where the building was occurring (in this case, equity
                can step in to prevent unjust enrichment and undue
                hardship to the mistaken improver).

                a.  In this case, there may be **equitable remedies**
                    available, specifically:

                    i.  If the building is movable (could be detached
                        from ground and moved somewhere else), builder
                        may be permitted to do this.

                    ii. If this isn't feasible (typically it isn't),
                        then a court may allow the builder to recover
                        the market value of the improvements by selling
                        them to the landowner at the market rate (i.e.,
                        compelling the landowner to buy the improvements
                        are the market rate).

                    iii. If the landowner cannot or will not purchase
                         the improvements at the market rate, then the
                         improver can buy the land at the market rate
                         for that land without the improvement (i.e.,
                         the pre-improvement market price).

                    iv. If neither party is interested in purchasing or
                        can't afford to do it, the court can order
                        selling both the land and the house at auction
                        to a third party; then when money comes, in,
                        dividing that b/t the original landowner and the
                        improver proportionately.

                b.  Note the goal of each remedy is to ensure that the
                    land and the building on the land are owned by the
                    same person.

        ii. Under no circumstances is an improver authorized to go upon
            the land of another without his knowledge or consent and
            demolish improvements they made by mistake.

            1.  I.e., the court concludes that ∆ must pay for the
                building.

            2.  Court concedes ∆ built the lot in good faith, but it
                doesn't matter, because of the malicious destruction --
                he has dirty hands, since he resorted to self-help and
                took the law into his own hands.

                a.  Equity is only available to those with clean hands

        iii. Dissent says demolishing the house is compliant with Texas
             removal law.

             1.  Notes π didn't have clean hands, too, because it
                 demanded far above the house's market value when ∆
                 realized mistake and offered to buy it.

             2.  Dissent is concerned about unequal bargaining power,
                 the leverage π has over ∆.

             3.  Doesn't think there should have been recovery for the
                 house.

        iv. Prof Lee notes: jurisdictions differ in their treatment of
            mistaken improvers.

            1.  Some allow landowner to get an injunction requiring
                demolition of the structure or a declaration that it's
                theirs as a fixture.

            2.  Other jurisdictions follow the principle of restitution,
                which is very similar to this case, with three options.

                a.  Landowner keeps house and pays its value to builder.

                b.  Let builder buy land at market rate before
                    improvement.

                c.  Or, sell the land and divide the proceeds.

**II. Enforcing the Right to Exclude**

***A. Three Ways to Enforce the Right to Exclude***

1.  **Criminal Law**: criminal trespass law typically involves small,
    misdemeanor fines (i.e., in Jacque, recall the sheriff imposed a
    \$30 fine. Even though the fines are small, they allow people to
    call the police to remove trespassers rather than requiring the
    exercise of self-help. (Police are less emotional, less likely to be
    violent).

2.  **Civil Actions**:

    a.  \(1\) Trespass: protects possession of property and right to
        exclude.

    b.  \(2\) Ejectment: protects ownership and protects owner against
        adverse possession.

    c.  \(3\) Nuisance: protects the use and enjoyment of land.

3.  **Self Help**:

    a.  Uncontroversial forms:

        i.  Put up a wall to make it hard for people to trespass on your
            land.

        ii. If you lease an apartment of own a house and you don't want
            random ppl coming inside, you can lock the door.

    b.  Controversial forms:

        i.  In general, someone who already possesses real property is
            permitted to use reasonable force to prevent or terminate a
            trespass. But you cannot use lethal force. Lethal force to
            stop a trespass is not reasonable. You can't use spring guns
            either.

        ii. Self help also becomes controversial for those who own
            property but don't currently possess it.

    c.  ***Burg v. Wiley*** (Minn. 1978) -- **Self-help involving real
        property**. π tenant leaded land from ∆ landlord to open a
        restaurant. The lease provided that the tenant could not
        renovate or change the structure of the building and that if the
        tenant breached the terms, the landlord had the right to
        re-enter and take possession. π remodeled without landlord's
        permission and was accused of health code violations in
        operating the restaurant---both prohibited by the lease. While
        the restaurant was temporarily closed for renovations, ∆ called
        the police and changed the locks when the π was gone, even
        though the lease had not yet expired. ∆ then relet the place to
        another tenant.

        i.  Court says the self help exercised by landlord was not
            allowed b/c of two issues.

            1.  Tenant had not abandoned the property. If the tenant had
                abandoned the property, then he would no longer have
                property rights. Court says no abandonment.

            2.  There was an actual trespass here and an actual
                termination of the trespass; the question is whether the
                termination was unlawful as a matter of law (i.e., can
                the court decide this without going to a jury). Court
                says self-help -- changing the locks -- was unlawful as
                a matter of law; self-help is never allowed (changes
                common law rule that says self-help is permissible if it
                is peaceable) but says it doesn't matter since outcome
                would be the same either way).

                a.  Court says it wasn't peaceable because there was a
                    history of animosity between the parties and
                    violence cold have ensued. Peaceable means no risk
                    of violence. MN then adopts modern rule that says
                    self-help is never permissible.

                    i.  **Traditional rule**: self-help is permissible
                        if (1) landlord is entitled to possession
                        and (2) the means of re-entry was peaceable.

                    ii. Court says the traditional rule would not have
                        worked here:

                        1.  \(1\) lease was breached so landlord was
                            entitled to retake possession --
                            straightforward

                        2.  \(2\) keen history of animosity means
                            violence might have ensued. Thus, a risk of
                            violence can make the entry no peaceable.
                            Peaceable means actually peaceful with no
                            risk of violence.

                    iii. **Landlord/Tenant modern trend**: what the
                         court changes to: **self-help is never
                         available to dispossess a tenant** who is in
                         possession and has not abandoned or voluntarily
                         surrendered the premises because there is an
                         inherent risk of violence.

            3.  Court goes farther for policy reason of deterring
                violence. Court says if the rule were that only actual
                violence would make self-help prohibited, tenants would
                understand they could simply stop the self-help by
                getting violent with the landlord.

            4.  Prof Lee notes that other courts more recently have
                allowed self-help in commercial landlord tenant disputes
                (the idea is that if ppl are kicked out of business
                premises, as opposed to their houses, it is less likely
                that violence will ensure).

    d.  ***Williams v. Ford Motor Credit Company*** (8th Cir. 1982) --
        **Self-help involving personal property/movables**. Husband and
        wife (Williams) bought car, got divorced, and wife got to keep
        the car but ex-husband had to make the payments for the next 18
        months. Ex-husband stopped making payments and repo men from
        Ford Motor Credit Co. came to repossess the car. Williams awoke
        when repo men came; the interaction was polite. Repo men took
        the car. Williams filed police report for stolen car and later
        sues.

        i.  Williams loses, creditors win: the repo was permissible
            (i.e., self-help is permitted).

            1.  Court notes UCC allows repossession without judicial
                process and without having to first go to court "if this
                can be done without the breach of the peace."

                a.  Court interprets this to mean that: it might be
                    impermissible even if there was no actual violence
                    if there was a sufficiently high risk of violence.
                    **Peaceable means no actual violence AND no really
                    high risk of violence.**

                    i.  Court seems to have a high threshold for how
                        much risk is too much risk.

                        1.  There was actually a confrontation here,
                            albeit polite (Note: in *Berg*, even without
                            a confrontation the court felt it was too
                            dangerous).

                        2.  This rule could encourage ppl to confront
                            repo men since creating a confrontation
                            would mean the repo wasn't peaceable enough.

                b.  Dissent takes opposite view: the jury should have
                    been allowed to decide whether this posed a high
                    risk of violence.

                    i.  Repo men should be required to retreat when both
                        of the following is true:

                        1.  \(1\) Detection has occurred (i.e., Williams
                            figured out repo men were there) (seems moot
                            cause you can't have 2 without 1)

                        2.  \(2\) Confrontation ensues (i.e., Williams
                            comes out to talk to the repo men)

        ii. Why does the Court's opinion---even if it seems to encourage
            violence---make sense?

            1.  If you make repossessions difficult, then you can't use
                self help b/c there's a always a risk of confrontation;
                this means every time defaults on credit payments the
                creditor is going to have to make great efforts to get a
                court order, get a sheriff, etc.

            2.  This is time consuming and expensive---the price will
                likely just get passed off to borrowers, since it's now
                more expensive and riskier to get loans; in turn making
                it harder for ppl to get credit.

        iii. Note, while this may seem like two courts reaching
             different conclusions on similar facts, there is at least
             one major difference between *Berg* and *Williams*: *Berg*
             dealt with real property, dirt and buildings, whereas
             *Williams* deals with personal property.

             1.  For repossession of personal property, most courts
                 follow *Williams*, allowing self-help so long as there
                 isn't a very high chance of violence ensuing.

**III. Limits/Exceptions to The Right to Exclude**

***A. Overview***

1.  Recognizing the right to exclude can sometimes be too burdensome on
    society. When stakes are high, the law switches from **exclusion
    approach** to a **governmental approach**, meaning the
    government---instead of individual landowners---decides what can and
    can't be on the property.

2.  **Necessity**: Justify what would otherwise be a trespass where
    there is a reasonable threat to life.

    a.  ***Ploof v. Putnam*** (VT 1908) -- To save his family during a
        storm π tied his ship to ∆'s private dock and ∆'s servant untied
        it, causing injuries to π's ship and his family. π sues,
        claiming trespass by the servant in unmooring the ship and that
        ∆ had a duty to permit π to moor his ship to the dock in the
        storm.

        i.  Court rules for π: the unmooring was potentially
            impermissible. In allowing action to proceed, the case was
            remanded to lower court, and π was given damages.

        ii. Ordinarily, mooring to someone else's dock without their
            permission would be a trespass; BUT

        iii. **Necessity creates an exception**, justifying what would
             otherwise be a trespass. The exception applies with special
             force to the preservation of human life. The preservation
             of human life supersedes one's right to exclude others from
             property.

        iv. Rule: A property owner may be liable for damages where a
            trespasser is justified in entering the property by
            necessity defense and property owner injures trespasser in
            exercising right to exclude.

        v.  Note that trespassers are always liable for damages:
            ***Vincent v. Laker Erie*** (Minn. 1910) -- Court ruled that
            boatowner was allowed to dock out of necessity, but was
            nonetheless liable for damages caused to the dock.

        vi. Prof talks about additional information that casts the case
            in different light, for both π and ∆. Cultural biases can
            impact cases and judgments.

        vii. Prof. also mentions the cultural cognition literature and
             the persistent risk of bias, even today, in assessing
             objective facts.

        viii. Prof. also mentions eugenics and *Buck v. Bell*.

3.  **Custom**

    a.  ***McConico v. Singleton*** (SC 1818) -- π owned unenclosed and
        unimproved land and had warned the ∆ not to hunt there. ∆
        nevertheless, went and hunted there.

        i.  Ordinarily one would think that if somebody has land and
            somebody else goes on it without permission, that's a
            trespass. BUT court say this is not a trespass.

            1.  **Owners have no right---because custom says so---to
                prevent others from hunting on the owner's unenclosed,
                unimproved, lands**. Court offers a few different
                reasons behind its decision.

                a.  **Custom**---people have always been allowed to hunt
                    on unenclosed, unimproved land. (i.e., custom
                    clearly says this is ok, and nothing in the
                    legislature or English common law says otherwise)

                b.  **Necessity**---Hunters needed the rule to hunt deer
                    and feed and cloth their families.

                c.  **Commons** (sort of)---when land is unenclosed and
                    unimproved, it's very difficult for hunters to
                    figure out exactly when it starts belonging to
                    someone. Too burdensome to make ppl figure this out.
                    Hunting is a major source of profit and the forest
                    is regarded as a public common; wild animals belong
                    to the first taker.

                d.  **SC legislature**: Rule is confirmed implicitly by
                    the legislature (seems to be a rule in state
                    allowing this).

                    i.  Note that legislatures can override custom with
                        statutes.

                e.  **English common law** doesn't contradict this
                    either.

                f.  **Policy Considerations** argue in favor of this
                    customary rule: allowing unfettered hunting is good
                    for training militias, which reduces the need for
                    large, standing armies (i.e., threats to democracy).

                    i.  Leaves open the question that policy could
                        perhaps have led the court to rule against
                        custom (i.e., what if the custom was a bad
                        custom?)

            2.  Professor says three different standard exceptions to
                the right to exclude are all packed into this one case:
                **Custom**, **Necessity**, and **Public Policy**.

4.  **Public Policy**

    a.  The right to exclude is limited where society is better off if
        this right is not granted. Under some circumstances the
        Government can say that owners lack the right to exclude certain
        people because society is better off if such exclusion is
        prohibited. Property law must coincide with the well-being of
        humans.

        i.  ***State v. Shack*** (NJ 1971) -- Tejaras and Shack (a
            lawyer) each work for nonprofits and want to go on Tedesco's
            farm to remove stitches from one of Tedesco's injured
            migrant workers (i.e., not tenants with tenants' rights) and
            to provide another with legal advice. Tedsco allows them
            onto his farm, but only if the meeting takes place in his
            office with him there. Tejeras and Shack refuse: they want
            to meet with the migrant worker privately in his living
            quarters. Tedsco summons law enforcement and brings an
            action for trespass, since presumably he has right to exlude
            nonprofit workers from property.

            1.  Lower court and appeals court find Tejaras and Shack
                guilty of trespass but State SC find that entering the
                property was not a trespass---overrules, finding
                exception for policy reasons.

                a.  Argument isn't integrated; consists of various
                    considerations the court thinks all point in the
                    same direction of limiting the right to exclude
                    (policy question for test).

                    i.  "Property rights serve human values. They are
                        recognized to that end and are limited to by it.
                        Title to real property cannot include dominion
                        over the destiny of persons the owner permits to
                        come upon the premises. Their well-being must
                        remain the paramount concern of a system of
                        law."

                b.  Just as contract law prevents ppl from signing
                    contracts that constrain health, welfare and
                    dignity, so to does property law protect these
                    rights.

                c.  Courts need to be especially considerate of discrete
                    and insular minorities, b/c the democratic system
                    (rule by majority vote) does not work well to
                    protect their rights (i.e., tough to organize; don't
                    have the votes).

                    i.  i.e., migrant workers are a discrete and insular
                        minority.

                    ii. Court should help these ppl by stepping in and,
                        in this case, providing limits on the right to
                        exclude.

                        1.  Legislature can't help b/c their interests
                            won't be represented well in democratic
                            system.

                    iii. It would be unconscionable to deny the
                         nonprofit workers access to the migrant
                         workers.

                d.  Purpose of federal statute funding these nonprofits
                    was to aid migrant farm workers and their families;
                    allowing exclusion of these nonprofit workers would
                    frustrate this goal.

                    i.  Raises question: should the right to exclude
                        cease to apply whenever anyone who receives
                        federal funding wants to go on to your property
                        to achieve the goal the federal funding aims to
                        achieve?

                e.  "Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas" -- **Sic Utere
                    Principle**: Use your own in such a way that you
                    don't harm someone else. Property rights aren't
                    absolute.

                    i.  If farm owner is allowed to exclude the
                        nonprofit workers, this harms the migrant
                        workers.

                    ii. Professor notes this implies that migrants not
                        only have a right to receive the legal aid and
                        medical care but also a right to receive it on
                        the farm owner's property.

                        1.  Also: how reasonable is it to think the farm
                            workers could have left and gone somewhere
                            else? (transportation? Language
                            limitations?)

                f.  Rights are relative: there is a **necessity
                    exception** to right to exclude. Farmer must allow
                    reasonable access for nonprofit workers, gov't
                    workers, members of the press (employer may bar
                    general public, solicitors, salespeople).

        ii. The court did not provide an easy way to sort out which
            visitors the farmer could exclude and which ones he
            couldn't; indirectly raises the question of the difference
            between **rules** and **standards**.

            1.  Both are tools for making decisions. There is no right
                or wrong or preferred method; no one size fits all
                approach; the law in fact does use both.

            2.  **Rules** (*Jaque*; *Pile*; *Golden Press*)

                a.  **Pros:** simple and general, generate conclusions
                    at low costs, cheap to apply. Easy to figure out if
                    you're satisfying them.

                b.  **Cons:** inflexible and insensitive to nuances of
                    particular situations. As a result, sometimes the
                    conclusion may not be optimal. Developing optimal
                    rules thus can be high-cost b/c you must consider
                    all possible outcomes.

            3.  **Standards** (*State v. Shack):*

                a.  **Pros**: Inherently include some conception for the
                    law's purposes. More flexible than rules are. More
                    sensitive to the particularities of a given
                    situation. Can be cheap to create in advance b/c you
                    don't need to consider all the possible outcomes
                    (i.e., "drive at a safe speed."). Generate
                    appropriate results in a wider range of
                    circumstances.

                b.  **Cons**: Applying the standard can be expensive;
                    generating conclusions in specific cases is higher
                    cost and more complex b/c you need to consider more
                    things than you would in simply applying a rule.
                    Property law can have many scenarios; you may need
                    to go into court to get a ruling on how the standard
                    applies to a particular set of facts. Harder for ppl
                    to anticipate what the court will do if you end up
                    in court. You might worry that the cultural
                    cognition concerns can influence how the standard is
                    being applied.

5.  **Public Accommodation Laws (a version of the public policy
    exception)**

    a.  **General Rule**: Under the common law, nonpublic/private
        accommodations can exclude people for any reason or no reason at
        all.

    b.  **General Rule:** For public accommodations in the travel
        business---innkeepers, common carriers, restaurants and
        others---there is a duty of nondiscrimination towards possible
        customers.

        i.  **Duty 1**: Serve any person requesting service, provided it
            is available

        ii. **Duty 2**: Charge reasonable prices (can't exclude someone
            b/c they're refusing to pay an unreasonable price).

        iii. These rules may have been used to protect travelers in
             particular because proprietors of these types of
             establishments might commonly have a local monopoly on it.

             1.  Caveat: for many years, these traditional common law
                 rules did not prohibit racial discrimination.

                 a.  Racial discrimination in hotels and restaurants was
                     consistent with the common law.

    c.  ***Utson v. Resorts International Hotel, Inc.*** (NJ 1982) --
        Ken Uston was an excellent card counter for blackjack,
        originally permitted to play by casinos. But the casino
        commission changed the rules about reshuffling decks, making
        card counting much more effective. As a result, RIH barred Uston
        from its casino, because his strategy increased his chances to
        win too much. Casino Commission says this is ok: there's no
        statute or regulation prohibiting resorts from excluding
        professional card counters.

        i.  Court holds that Casino cannot exclude Utson: any common law
            right of exclusion was abrogated by statute, the Casino
            Control Act, which precludes resorts from banning
            professional card counters (but gave RIH 90 days to try to
            persuade the commission to change its deck reshuffling
            rules, because there may have been unintended consequences
            of the recent changes).

        ii. Court then moves on to discuss the common law right to
            exclude (Casino Control Act has not completely divested
            resorts of the common law right to exclude).

            1.  Common law right to exclude is limited by a competing
                right of reasonable access to public places.

                a.  What is reasonable must be determined by the facts
                    of each case (i.e., this is a standard not a rule).

                    i.  Here, there's no threat to security, nor did
                        Utson disrupt the functioning of the casino

                b.  **Standard**: While what is reasonable may vary; as
                    you increase the extent to which private property is
                    devoted to public use, you simultaneously increase
                    the extent to which owners of that property must
                    accommodate the individual rights of members of the
                    public to come inside (i.e., the less you can
                    exclude).

                    i.  The more that property is used to increase
                        private profit through use of the property by
                        members of the public, the more that property
                        must accommodate those members' individual
                        rights (i.e., if it's excluding it must have a
                        reasonable justification for doing so---in this
                        case, winning at blackjack is not reasonable).

6.  **Antidiscrimination Law:** limits the ability to exclude protected
    groups and refuses to enforce private agreements that would have the
    effect of excluding protected groups.

    a.  ***Shelly v. Kramer*** (1948) -- Owners in a St. Louis
        neighborhood agreed to enter into a covenant (special kind of
        contract for real property) that prevented the property owners
        form selling to African Americans. The owners were trying to
        lock in a custom by means of contract to maintain a white
        neighborhood. When the Shelleys, a black family, bought a house
        in the neighborhood, Kramer, who owned property in the
        neighborhood, sued to enforce the covenant, trying to get the
        sale reversed.

        i.  **Racially restrictive covenants are not enforceable**.
            Court says the issue is not whether the covenant is valid
            but whether it is judicially enforceable.

            1.  Court notes 14^th^ Amendment. Problem is that for 14^th^
                Amendment to apply, you need to have state action that's
                discriminatory, but this looks like a private
                arrangement.

            2.  Court says: judicial enforcement of a racially
                restrictive covenant to block the sale of a home from a
                willing seller to a willing Black-buyer *is* state
                action; this violates the equal protection clause; so,
                the racially restrictive covenant is not enforceable in
                court.

                a.  Note: saying that judicial enforcement is state
                    action seems like a slippery con law slope (solution
                    is law only applies to covenants).

        ii. Limits of Laws: Prof notes that even though the decision
            made racially restrictive covenants unenforceable; that
            doesn't mean these covenants weren't still having a harmful
            effect, perpetuating racial discrimination for decades:

            1.  home owners were still writing them into deeds; banks
                were using the covenants for redlining when making
                mortgage decisions (i.e., banks worry that neighborhoods
                transitioning to not all white reduce property
                values---so they'd be less eager to rent in these
                neighborhoods; rent in these neighborhoods for less
                favorable rates; or make fewer loans to non-whites;
                properties with racially restrictive covenants received
                more favorable rates); and federal gov't used presence
                of racially restrictive covenants as a positive signal
                in setting housing policies.

    b.  The Fair Housing Act -- Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
        1968.

        i.  Directly prohibits a range of discriminatory behaviors
            against members of enumerated protected classes in the
            housing field. Over the years, the FHA has been amended to
            add protected classes such as the disabled.

        ii. Prohibits creation of racially restrictive covenants.

        iii. Restricts whom you can refuse to sell or rent to; also
             limits advertising (i.e., you can't advertise sales or
             rental preference based on protected categories---note: not
             every preference is banned, you could ban "republicans" for
             example).

**[Relinquishing Sovereignty]{.underline}**

**I. Abandonment and Destruction**

***A. Overview***

1.  Owners have certain rights, including the right to exclude---owners
    are permitted to prevent other ppl from taking their property. But
    property ownership also carries burdens: not only do you have
    rights, you have responsibilities (i.e., property taxes).

2.  The "bundle of rights" includes the right to abandon property (throw
    it away or relinquish claim of title) and the right to destroy
    property (demolish, burn or eliminate its value). However, from a
    policy perspective, right to abandon or destroy is not always in the
    best interest of social welfare.

3.  Just as public policy limits the right to exclude, it also limits
    the rights to relinquish, to give up property. While owners can
    easily discard personal property (movables), there are limitations
    on the abandonment of real property (dirt and buildings).

4.  ***Pocono Springs Civic Assoc. v. Mackenzie*** (PA 1995) --
    Mackenzie (∆) wants to sell worthless land in vacation home
    development. Development didn't sell enough lots to make building
    sewer system worthwhile; normal alternative, septic system, couldn't
    be installed. No one wants to buy. ∆ tries to give it away, but
    can't; tries to give to development but they won't take it. ∆ still
    has to pay property taxes and home owner's fees (this can happen
    when ppl buy property and then it plummets in value). ∆ doesn't
    accept mail, notarizes desire to abandon, and doesn't visit or use
    the land in attempt to abandon (saying it's now owned by the
    sovereign, i.e., the state), Gov't tries to sell the land at auction
    but no one bid on it; and Pocono Springs---home owner's
    assoc.---sues ∆ for not paying fees.

    a.  Court finds that ∆ did not abandon his land because he did not
        relinquish right, title, claim and possession. He tried to
        abandon but it was never taken by someone else, so his attempt
        to abandon was irrelevant.

        i.  Rule: in order for a gift to actually occur, the gift must
            be accepted.

    b.  Court states a **rule for abandoning property** (that applies to
        personal and real property). Abandonment of property requires
        all four of the following:

        i.  **(1)** voluntary relinquishment of all title, claim, right
            and possession;

        ii. **(2)** intent to terminate ownership;

        iii. **(3)** without vesting rights in any other person;

             1.  i.e., gifting the property to someone else is not
                 abandonment, it's gifting

        iv. **(4)** intent to not reclaim further possession or resume
            ownership, possession, or enjoyment.

    c.  ∆ never satisfied this rule, because he has not done element 1:
        he has not relinquished his title, rights, claim, and
        possession. He tried to, but he failed. No one wanted to take it
        from him.

        i.  **RULE: If you actually own real property, you can't abandon
            it**; intent to abandon it is irrelevant.

            1.  Why have this rule?

                a.  Encourages inefficiently risky, socially
                    inefficient, behavior.

                b.  Environmental pollution concerns (i.e., ppl just use
                    land as a dumping ground)

                c.  Negative externalities on surrounding neighborhood
                    (i.e., house turns into drug den, etc.)

            2.  To an extent we permit abandonment of personal property
                (although you can't throw away rechargeable batteries,
                mercury thermometers, household chemicals, or certain
                pieces of electronics).

5.  ***Eyerman v. Mercantile Trust Co.*** (MO 1975) -- **Destruction of
    property after death may not be permitted**. Woman died and her will
    had a provision that she wanted the house on her property---located
    in an upscale private community---destroyed. The area was considered
    architecturally noteworthy and neighbors did not want it destroyed;
    they sought an injunction to prevent the destruction. Property value
    with the house intact was \$40,000, without the house it was \$650.

    a.  Court grants the neighbors the injunction.

        i.  Prof notes the community did have legal covenants limiting
            what you could build on property and could have had one
            precluding destruction of home on property.

    b.  Court decides on policy considerations: fulfilling the terms of
        the will would cause unwarranted destruction.

        i.  There's no sufficient benefit to anyone to counterbalance
            the loss that the destruction would cause.

            1.  Notes property value with versus without the house.

            2.  Community is listed as a landmark; knocking down house
                would be like a "missing tooth"

            3.  Neighbors would suffer loss; property values would
                decline

            4.  St. Louis needs housing---court takes judicial notice
                (i.e., facts not entered into evidence by either party)
                of drop in housing supply.

    c.  Dissent also focused on policy:

        i.  If you own property, you are free to decide what to do with
            it when you die.

        ii. Other policy reasons aren't convincing.

    <!-- -->

    a.  Prof. Lee notes a policy rationale for justifying the
        destruction of property in this case: **Peggy Radin's theory:
        "personhood" -- is tied up in property.** Some property has
        meaning for individuals beyond monetary value. (i.e., one's
        childhood home or the value of a wedding ring for a jeweler
        versus a married person); this sentimental effect adds value to
        property.

        i.  In this case, perhaps, with good reason (i.e., the Woman's
            husband and father died in the house), the house might be
            reduced in value for the owner.

        ii. You can't simply assume that people will do what is
            economically rational with their property; nor should the
            law necessarily require them to do so.

        iii. An argument in favor in destruction even if it would have
             been socially inefficient.

**II. Transfer and Alienability**

***A. Overview***

1.  The law favors transferability. Transferability is considered an
    important stick in the "bundle of rights." It enhances autonomy
    because it permits the owner to shed responsibility for things that
    no longer suit the owner's wants or needs and it allows the owner to
    acquire property that may be better suited to the owner's wants and
    needs.

2.  Typical scenario: the owner still finds property has some value but
    ideally would prefer not to own it anymore.

3.  Two types of transfers:

    a.  Exchanges---i.e., trading, owner relinquishes title to something
        owned in exchange for reciprocal transfer or money.

    b.  Gifts---owner relinquishes title without expecting anything in
        return.

4.  The law supports transferability and favors transactions (while
    disfavoring absolute restraints on alienability)

    a.  **Statue of Frauds**: transfer of land needs to be in writing
        (deeds)

    b.  **The Delivery Requirement**: thing or deed must be actually
        given to the transferee

    c.  **Absolute restraints on alienability are void**: Property law
        does not enforce unqualified restrictions on transferability
        made by the parties. For example, if X transfers property to Y
        on the condition that Y must never transfer it to anyone
        else---this is not enforceable.

5.  Arguments for transferability

    a.  Life enhancing---people should be able to get rid of stuff they
        don't want anymore and acquire things they care more about.
        Having a certain amount of material possessions is necessary to
        a good life.

    b.  Ability to relinquish material possession---you feel freer and
        are freer with fewer material possessions.

    c.  Economic justification---promotes efficiency through mutually
        beneficial exchanges (i.e., one guy has two left shoes, another
        has two right shoes).

        i.  Some people think there is a winner and loser in every deal.

    d.  Enhance Autonomy, the power of owners---allows owners to pick
        their successors.

        i.  Can have negative consequences (i.e., *Shelly v. Kramer*) or
            positive consequences (i.e., giving money to charity)

    e.  Prof Lee: the law should facilitate transfer because it leads to
        the concentration of wealth.

6.  **The Delivery Requirement**

    a.  RULE: In several contexts, the law will recognize a transfer as
        having occurred (being valid) only if there has been actual
        delivery of the thing itself or the title to the thing. (i.e.,
        sometimes transfers are valid only if there is evidence of title
        of the thing being transferred and the thing is delivered to the
        transferee).

        i.  To make a gift you must actually give it to the person; if
            you're giving something really big---like a house---the
            title will suffice.

        ii. Deeds must be [signed]{.underline}, [sealed]{.underline},
            and [delivered]{.underline}.

    b.  ***Irons v. Smallpiece*** (Eng. 1819) -- Action for trover
        (i.e., an action for conversion of personal property---someone
        took your property and you're seeking damages). A father
        promised his son two colts but possession did not change hands.
        Executor of the estate refused to give the sons the colts after
        the father had died.

        i.  Since the colts were never delivered, and possession was
            never actually held by the plaintiffs, they were not vested
            in the plaintiff as a gift (no deed changed hands either).
            The colts were held by the father until his death so they
            will be passed through the will.

        ii. A verbal promise does not fulfill the delivery requirement.

    c.  ***Foster v. Reiss*** (NJ 1955) -- Ethel Reiss, preparing to
        enter surgery, leaves a note for her husband that tells him
        where money is stashed in various places around the house and
        provides instructions on what to do with it. Ethel went into a
        coma after the surgery and died 9 days later. Her will only gave
        one dollar to the husband and the rest of the estate to her
        descendants. She died, and the descendants sued the husband for
        the money left to him in the letter. Husband said the money was
        a gift in anticipation of death.

        i.  Court says there was no gift here and the money goes to the
            estate. There was no delivery of the items during the
            donor's lifetime. Although the letter shows donative intent,
            this intent alone is insufficient to constitute a transfer;
            there needs to be an affirmative act (i.e., actual delivery)
            of donation on the part of the donor to affect the transfer,
            and not merely donee's taking possession of them.

        ii. **Dissent**: This is insane. We're imposing a merely
            ritualistic requirement. She was dying in a hospital bed:
            how was she supposed to amend her will or actually
            physically hand over the items to her husband; was the
            husband supposed to bring all the stuff to her at the
            hospital so she could then give it back to him?

        iii. **Defense of Formalism**: we read the case with the
             understanding that her intent was to give the money to her
             husband though the actual letter is written somewhat
             ambiguously; professor points out that because the
             ambiguities of the letter itself, requiring Ethel to
             actually give stuff to her husband might have cleared up
             the ambiguities---i.e., defense of formalism).

        iv. Rule: Expression of intent by the donor and mere taking of
            possession of the property by the donee does not fulfill the
            delivery requirement.

        v.  Precision in drafting is extremely important.

    d.  ***Gilbert v. McSpadden*** (TX 1936) -- **Shows the delivery
        requirement for deeds (rather than gifts)**. Father sold parcels
        of land to his children for consideration of \$1 and love and
        affection (i.e., a sale not a gift, at least nominally). But he
        kept the deeds in his possession and continued to "exercise
        dominion over the land." Years later, he went to his daughter's
        house to deliver the deeds; before he physically handed her the
        deed, he died in his sleep.

        i.  Court says the deeds aren't valid. The delivery was not made
            so the property goes to the administrator of the state.
            Although there was an intention to deliver the deed at some
            point in the future, the father retained possession until
            his death.

            1.  Another example of extreme formalism.

**III. Licenses and Bailments**

***A. Introduction*** -- What owners want to do when they want to
preserve their right to exclude in general while relinquishing certain
rights for a limited period of time or for a limited set of purposes.
The law enables these sorts of partial relinquishments. Two examples are
licenses and bailments.

***B. Licenses Overview***

1.  Temporary, revocable **waivers of the right to exclude**. A property
    owner gives permission to gain access to his property (i.e., letting
    a repair person into your apartment to fix something---if the repair
    person does a bad job, you can revoke the license and kick him out).
    Licenses are **revocable** **at any time**; they render what would
    otherwise be a trespass not a trespass; and the Statute of Frauds
    does not apply to licenses (i.e., they don't need to be in writing).

    a.  Other, less ephemeral ways of waiving the right to exclude
        include leases and easements.

2.  ***Wood v. Leadbitter*** (Eng. 1845) -- *Licenses are revocable at
    any time, even if somebody actually paid money for it.* Wood
    purchased a ticket to view horseraces on the racetrack within an
    Earl's estate; Earl's servant rejects Wood before the races are
    over.

    a.  Court analyzes the revocability of the license (via the
        purchased ticket) by drawing the distinction between two legally
        different categories.

        i.  \(1\) License -- a license is an impermanent waiver of the
            right to exclude. It's giving you permission to come on my
            property temporarily. Ordinarily, if you come on my
            property, it's a trespass. But if I give you permission,
            it's not a trespass.

            1.  Licenses are, by their nature, revocable. If I invite
                you onto my property, I can uninvite you.

        ii. \(2\) Licenses paired with grants -- are irrevocable. The
            rationale is that the grantor is estopped from defeating his
            or her own grant. (Estoppel means that something you have
            done prevents you from exercising a right you otherwise
            would have been able to exercise).

            1.  **If you have a license coupled with a grant, you can't
                revoke the license in a way that defeats the grant (you
                are estopped from doing so)**.

            2.  A sells a sofa to B on Craiglist; B says looks good,
                pays A \$400 for the sofa. A says come on over to pick
                up the sofa. B comes over to pick up the sofa. As B
                enters A's apartment to get the sofa, A says I'm
                revoking the license permitting you to enter my
                apartment. If this were to happen, B would then be out
                \$400 and not have a sofa. B would have paid for the
                sofa but not been able to get it. A would have defeated
                the grant of the sofa to B by revoking the license.
                You're not allowed to do this.

                a.  Although licenses are ordinarily revocable; when
                    they're coupled with a grant in this way, they are
                    not revocable until the grant is complete.

                b.  If the sofa had just been a gift, you could revoke
                    the grant and then revoke the license.

        iii. A ticket purchased to watch a sporting/entertainment event
             is just a license (not a license coupled with a grant).
             Thus, it's **revocable at any time for any reason**.

        iv. Today, the law is that **licenses are revocable at any
            time**.

            1.  Tickets purchased for events are licenses, revocable at
                any time.

                a.  You can probably get a refund for breach of
                    contract.

        v.  Licenses are not interests in land: meaning the statute of
            frauds doesn't apply---so it doesn't have to be in writing.
            You can create licenses orally (i.e., you can go visit a
            friend without getting a written license).

***C. Bailments Overview***

1.  When a property owner temporarily transfers possession or custody of
    personal property / an item to another person. Bailments are created
    by an express or implied contract and usually the parties have a
    special purpose in mind for transferring. Once this purpose is
    accomplished it is understood that the property will be returned to
    the owner. Right to exclude is transferred with the property.

2.  Bailor -- is an owner who temporarily relinquishes possession of the
    item in a bailment.

    a.  i.e., the owner of a coat who gives it over to a dry cleaner

3.  Bailee -- a person or party to whom goods are delivered for a
    purpose, such as custody or repair, without transfer of ownership.

    a.  i.e., someone who owns a coat takes it to the dry cleaners to be
        cleaned. Plans to pick up the coat in a couple of days. The
        person who owns the coat and hands it over is the bailor. The
        person who receive possession, the drycleaner, is the bailee.

4.  Bailment cases involve two distinct issues.

    a.  **(1)** Did a bailment exist? -- is this really a bailment case?

    b.  **(2)** If it did exist, what duty of care did the bailee have
        toward the bailor?

    c.  The reason why you're in court is because something has gone
        wrong and the bailor will typically want some money form the
        bailee because the bailor gave over something and didn't quite
        get back the same thing later on.

5.  ***Allen v. Hyatt Regency of Nashville*** (TN 1984) -- *Did a
    bailment exist?* π parks his car in the hotel parking lot (that was
    also open to the public) and it gets stolen. He needed a ticket to
    enter the enclosed parking lot and there was an attendant at the
    exit. There was also a liability release on the back of the ticket.

    a.  Key issue: whether the relationship between Allen and the hotel
        was in fact a bailment (i.e., had a bailment been created when
        Allen left the car in the parking lot?)

        i.  If yes, then the hotel to some extent has a duty of care
            towards Allen

    b.  Court says yes there was a bailment here (which in TN creates a
        statutory presumption of negligence), despite the disclaimer on
        the ticket (hotel hadn't shown customer read disclaimer or that
        hotel had called it to his attention).

        i.  Court notes that generally bailments are created when
            parking garages are **attended**; but not when
            **unattended**.

            1.  In an unattended parking lot, the customer hasn't
                delivered the car over to the custody of the defendant.

        ii. Court focuses on a few facts to conclude there was a
            bailment here:

            1.  This was a commercial garage and not a private person's
                house; it was enclosed, indoor, and attended. Attendant
                controlled the exit. Regular security personnel were
                patrolling the area. s

                a.  The features of the location where the car had been
                    parked seemed to indicate that the hotel was
                    relatively well-positioned to limit the risk of loss
                    (buttresses the policy rationale).

                    i.  Despite the disclaimer on the parking ticket

            2.  **Policy rationale**: the garage owner is better
                situated to protect a parked car than the person who
                parks the car and leaves it---better able to limit the
                risks of loss through theft. Moreover, the garage owner
                can distribute that cost of protection---cost of
                limiting risk---the across a wide range of people just
                by charging higher parking fees to everybody who parks
                there.

                a.  law and economics approach: place duties to avoid
                    harms on whichever party can avoid the harm at the
                    lowest cost. Garage owners are best
                    positioned---this is most efficient.

                b.  Interpreting property law in a way that supports a
                    certain policy outcome.

                    i.  i.e., like *State v. Shack*.

    c.  Other legal precedents: Bailment created where a car owner gave
        car to valet and bellboy went on a joy ride; bailment was
        created where a person delivered their car to an attended
        parking garage and it was stolen; NO bailment created where a
        car was stolen from an unattended parking lot---the driver did
        not deliver the car into the custody of the lot's owner.

    d.  **Dissent**: Thinks the test should focus on the actions of the
        bailor---whether the vehicle owner has made delivery to parking
        lot attendant that would amount to a relinquishment of exclusive
        possession, control, and dominion over the vehicle. The owner
        did not relinquish possession because he retained the key.

6.  **[Duty of Care for Bailments]{.underline}**

    a.  Joseph Story's three-part analysis of the duty of care: the duty
        of care varies depending upon the purpose for which the bailment
        was created. Three possibilities:

        i.  **(1)** **Sole benefit of the bailor**: bailee must exercise
            slight diligence and is only liable for gross negligence.

            1.  i.e., asking a friend to hold your coat while you go to
                the restroom.

        ii. **(2)** **Sole benefit of the bailee**: bailee must exercise
            great diligence and is liable for even slight negligence.

            1.  i.e., you borrow my bicycle to go for a ride; you are
                the bailee, and I am the bailor; you have temporary
                custody of the bike and bailment is solely for your
                benefit.

        iii. **(3)** **Reciprocal benefit**: bailee must exercise
             ordinary diligence and is liable for ordinary neglect.

             1.  i.e., you leave your coat at the drycleaner; you
                 benefit from having your coat cleaned, drycleaner
                 benefits from getting paid.

    b.  Modern Trend ("modern" since 1988---this could be a good idea
        for a student note):

        i.  Duty of reasonable care for all bailments.

            1.  Consider all of the relevant circumstances

                a.  Whether the bailee received compensation or paid
                    themselves for possession

                b.  Whether the bailment was for the bailee's benefit

        ii. There is evidence that in using a duty of reasonable care
            analysis, courts end up assigning different levels of care
            based on the type of bailment.

    c.  Complications

        i.  Since a bailment is a contractual relationship, the standard
            of care can be modified by agreement before the bailment
            commences.

            1.  i.e., to what extent can duties of care be modified by
                contract? Are these default duties or are these actual
                duties that apply no matter what a contract says?

            2.  i.e., in Allen v. Hyatt, the hotel tried to modify the
                duty of care, but the court wasn't confident that anyone
                had read it.

            3.  i.e., this is unclear---maybe you can modify by
                contract.

        ii. Court is **stricter** about bailees who **misdeliver** of
            goods (i.e., give it back to the wrong person) than when
            goods are lost, stolen, damaged, or destroyed while in
            bailee's custody.

7.  Duty of care for [voluntary]{.underline} v.
    [involuntary]{.underline} bailees

    a.  [Voluntary bailment]{.underline}: bailee has an ABSOLUTE DUTY to
        return the item to the actual bailer (strict liability), but
        only ordinary prudence to protect the item from damage
        (reasonable care).

    b.  [Involuntary bailment]{.underline}: bailee has no duty at all,
        unless the bailee exercises any dominion over the item, then he
        becomes responsible as if he is a voluntary bailee.

    c.  ***Cowen v. Pressprich*** (NY 1922) -- π (Cowen) sent its
        messenger (a runner), Goldberg, to deliver a bond to ∆ (drops in
        a receiving slot). ∆ immediately realizes it's the wrong bond;
        calls for messenger as messenger was leaving; gives messenger
        back the bond, but it turns out that this was a different
        messenger (i.e., ∆ returned the bond to a messenger who wasn't
        Goldberg). π sues to recover the lost bond.

        i.  π and ∆ disagree about applicable duty of care.

            1.  π argued that ∆ had an absolute duty to return the bond.

                a.  Strict liability. If you don't do return, then
                    you're liable.

            2.  ∆ argues that it has a duty only of due diligence and
                that it had exercised due diligence.

        ii. Lower court holds for the π, concluding that this was a
            voluntary bailment.

            1.  Except for the brief instant when the bond first came
                into the slot (during which it was momentarily an
                involuntary bailment), it was a voluntary bailment. And
                because the court thought it was a voluntary bailment,
                it then applies the duty of care that it thinks should
                apply to voluntary bailments. And that duty of care
                w/respect to mis-delivery is an absolute duty of care
                (hedges on what's absolute).

                a.  Delivery to the wrong person of a bailment is not
                    capable of being excused by any possible showing of
                    care, good faith, or innocence.

                b.  ∆ did not use reasonable measures to return the bond
                    (could have called π to have them send the correct
                    bond and swap).

            2.  **Dissent**: disagrees---majority is wrong about the
                type of bailment. This is an [involuntary
                bailment]{.underline}. Taking steps to divest yourself
                of an item that you received in error is not accepting
                possession of the item as a bailee and failing to return
                it. Picking it up and holding it for a bit is not
                voluntarily choosing to hang on to it.

                a.  While there was a slot to deposit bonds through the
                    door, this wasn't an invitation to deposit any
                    bonds; but rather only an invitation to deliver
                    bonds that the ∆ had some obligation to receive
                    because there was a transaction.

                b.  ∆ is under no obligation to receive the wrong bond.

                c.  You can't impose obligations on ppl by giving them
                    things involuntarily; involuntary bailees have no
                    obligations (then hedges on this).

                    i.  i.e., if you apply the duty of care that the
                        dissent thinks applies to involuntary bailees,
                        then there is no liability, **so long as you use
                        a reasonable means to return the item**.

                        1.  i.e., there isn't no duty, you have a duty
                            to be reasonable.

            3.  Prof. notes that both majority and dissent hedge on what
                they say and are concerned with reasonable duties of
                care---"feeling the tug" towards duty of reasonable
                care.

        iii. But this is overruled on appeal.

             1.  Dissent's reasoning becomes the holding on appeal. ∆
                 wins.

             2.  Takeaway: what's reasonable w/respect to an involuntary
                 bailment may differ from what's reasonable w/respect to
                 a voluntary bailment.

8.  **[Bailment Analysis:]{.underline}**

    a.  Step 1: Did someone temporarily give up their property?

    b.  Step 2: Was a bailment created?

    c.  Step 3: What is the duty of care that the bailee has over the
        thing in custody?

**[Law of Neighbors]{.underline}**

**I. Servitudes**

***A. Overview***

1.  **Servitudes** enable a more permanent---then licenses or
    bailments---transfer of rights. Servitudes are a way of creating,
    limited, durable transfers of property rights. They can help reduce
    or resolve land use conflicts by transferring individual
    rights---individual elements in the bundle---of owning land.

    a.  In the **"bundle of rights"** analogy, a servitude allows a
        property owner to transfer, swap or rearrange a "stick" or
        "sticks" in the bundle while still maintaining the actual
        bundle---the bundle can be changed and you still have a bundle,
        you still possess property (this is the dominant view of
        property today) (with the minority, "in rem," theory, some
        sticks in the bundle you can't remove to still have property).

    b.  The two types of servitudes are **easements** and **covenants.**

    c.  One special characteristic of servitudes is that they can "**run
        with the land**."

        i.  "Runs with the land" meaning they may apply to whomever owns
            the land, whether or not that person was involved in
            creating the servitudes in the first place.

            1.  "Runs with the land" means agreements don't go with the
                ppl who originally signed them; rather they go with the
                land.

                a.  i.e., **these types of servitudes are binding for
                    subsequent owners of the property.**

    d.  An **[easement]{.underline}** is a waiver of the right to
        exclude (typically easements allow someone else to come on to
        your property); but durable ones (not like licenses that can be
        revoked at any time). A nonpossessory right to use---for a
        limited purpose---property that's possessed by somebody else.

        i.  they **[always]{.underline} run with the land** (i.e., they
            always bind successors)

        ii. one solution to the *Hinman* case would have been if Hinman
            sold an easement to the airport to fly over his land while
            still maintaining all his other property rights.

        iii. In *Golden press*, if the factory had in fact paid
             permanent damages for the encroachment (i.e., if the court
             had actually awarded permanent damages), the result would
             have been that the damages purchased an easement that would
             have permitted continuing to encroach on the property to
             that extent.

    e.  A **[covenant]{.underline}** is a contractual agreement
        regarding the use of the land; they govern what can/cannot be
        done with respect to property; often they commit owners to do
        something that will benefit neighbors.

        i.  i.e., in *Eyerman*, there was a covenant that prohibited the
            building of certain kinds of things on the property.

        ii. i.e., *Shelley v. Kramer* (legally unenforceable covenant)

        iii. Positive covenants exist as well.

    f.  The difference between easements and covenants is that
        **easements involve the right to go on land** whereas
        **covenants involve the right to insist on use or nonuse of
        land**.

***B. Easements***

1.  A nonpossessory right to use---for a limited purpose---property
    that's possessed by somebody else.

<!-- -->

2.  Easements differ from leases because **easements convey a right to a
    particular use** rather than a right to possession (i.e., when you
    lease an apt., you have a right to possess the apartment). Easements
    don't provide rights to possession, but merely **rights to use**.

3.  Easements differ from licenses because easements are **irrevocably
    conveyed**. It may be for a limited period of time (not necessarily
    infinite). But during this limited period time, it cannot be
    revoked. Easements are limited to particular uses---rights to do
    some particular thing on someone's property; whereas licenses are
    waivers of the right to exclude, which means licenses give you some
    fair amount of freedom in terms of what you can do.

4.  **Two varieties of easements**: **intent determines whether is an
    easement [appurtenant]{.underline} or [in gross]{.underline}**
    (easements are always one of the other, but never both). If
    intentions are unclear, the court looks at the specific
    circumstances.

    a.  [Easement Appurtenant]{.underline}: easements that belong to
        another parcel of land.

        i.  i.e., the right to travel to and from parcel A by means of
            going across parcel B. You want to go Blackacre but it's
            difficult to do so, so you get rights to cut across
            Whiteacre. An easement that belongs to another parcel of
            land, Blackacre, and burdens another parcel of land,
            Whiteacre.

        ii. **Dominant parcel**: the one that is benefiting from the
            easement (i.e., Blackacre in above example)

        iii. **Servient Parcel**: the one that is burdened by the
             easement (i.e., Whiteacre in above example)

             1.  Parcels are often called estates.

             2.  People who own estates are called tenants (different
                 than familiar use of tenant but same spelling), so you
                 have a [dominant tenant]{.underline} and a [servient
                 tenant]{.underline}.

        iv. The people benefited or burdened by easements are determined
            by who owns Blackacre and who owns Whiteacre. If A owns
            Blackacre and sells it to B, B now gets to cut across
            Whiteacre. Likewise, if C owns Whiteacre and sells to D,
            once C sells to D, D is now also obligated to let ppl cut
            across Whiteacre to get to Blackacre.

            1.  **Ownership of the easement goes along with the parcel**

                a.  i.e., A has an easement to cross B's land. A sells
                    his estate to C. Now, C can cross B's land but A
                    cannot.

        v.  **If the easement contributes to the use and enjoyment of
            neighboring land, then it is likely an appurtenant easement
            (i.e., cutting across Whiteacre improves enjoyment of
            Blackacre); otherwise, it's in gross (i.e., putting a
            billboard on the side of someone's house in *Baseball
            Publishing* doesn't increase enjoyment of land).**

        vi. Default assumption is that an easement is appurtenant.

    <!-- -->

    a.  [Easement in gross]{.underline}: belongs to particular persons
        (not parcels).

        i.  i.e., you can go onto someone's property and you can fish in
            their pond.

            1.  Or an easement to put a billboard on a grantor's wall
                (*Baseball Publishing*)

        ii. These easements stay with the grantee (i.e., the dominant
            tenant). No dominant parcel in an easement in gross.

            1.  Easement stays with the dominant tenant no matter what
                property the dominant tenant owns and regardless of
                whether the dominant tenant even owns any property.

                a.  i.e., whoever bought Baseball Publishing's
                    headquarters wouldn't get the easement.

        iii. Easements in gross are only sometimes transferrable.

             1.  Most courts don't allow transfers of recreational
                 easements in gross (i.e., can't sell to someone else or
                 leave to someone in will).

             2.  Often inheritable if they are of a commercial character
                 (billboards, utility poles, railroad tracks).

> 5\. Easements can be [affirmative]{.underline} or
> [negative]{.underline}.

b.  Affirmative easements are easements that allow the holder of the
    easement---the dominant tenant---to actually do something on the
    servient parcel, acts that would otherwise be prohibited as either
    trespass or nuisance.

    i.  i.e., easement that allows you to walk across someone else's
        property.

c.  **Negative easements allow** the holder of the easement---the
    dominant tenant---to require that the servient tenant not do certain
    things on his own property, things that might harm the interests of
    the dominant tenant.

    i.  i.e., I can stop you from doing something on your property that
        ordinarily you'd be allowed to do.

    ii. **Four categories of Negative Easements**---to stop the
        subservient tenant from:

        1.  Interference with sunlight falling on windows.

        2.  Interference with flow of air in a defined channel.

        3.  Interference with flow of water in an artificial channel.

        4.  Removing lateral supports to buildings.

    iii. Most commonly used to prevent someone from blocking your view.

    iv. Negative easements are very rare.

    v.  If you want to keep someone from doing something on property,
        today this is more commonly done via covenants.

1.  **Easement Cases**

    a.  ***Baseball Publishing v. Bruton*** (Mass. 1938) --
        *Distinguishes easements from leases and licenses; discusses
        easements by grant.* π is in the billboard business: contracts
        to put a billboard sign on the wall of ∆'s building for
        \$25/year. π sends checks and ∆ keeps returning them; π erects
        the billboard sign on wall. 3 years later, ∆ has billboard
        removed. π sues for specific performance, arguing that it has a
        lease and is entitled to keep the sign on the wall.

        i.  Trial court says no lease here. Instead, this is a contract
            to give a license. Court then ordered specific performance
            of the contract, plus some damages.

        ii. Mass. Sup. Ct. disagrees, lays out the differences between
            leases and licenses:

            1.  A **lease** does 3 things, none of which a license
                does: (1) a lease conveys an interest in land; (2) a
                lease has to be done in writing (i.e., statute of frauds
                applies); (3) a lease transfers possession.

            2.  A **license** merely excuses what otherwise would be a
                trespass.

            3.  Here, the Agreement was not a lease (even though there
                was a writing) because there was no transfer of
                possession; there was only a limited use right to the
                Billboard company.

                a.  Billboard company could put a billboard on the wall,
                    but nothing else.

            4.  Here, the Agreement was not a license either. **Licenses
                are revocable**. Revoking may be a breach of contract,
                but it's still effective.

                a.  What the trial court did, giving specific
                    performance on a contract to grant a license is
                    pointless: if there's a contract to grant a license,
                    and a court says we're going to order specific
                    performance of that contract, then all that happens
                    is one has to give the license, but then they can
                    just revoke it.

            5.  **This was an easement granted by the writing: exclusive
                right and privilege to maintain a sign on the
                defendant's wall.**

                a.  This is an easement in gross b/c it's for the
                    benefit of a company, baseball publishing, not some
                    adjacent parcel of land. The easement is personal to
                    the company.

                b.  There was a contract to grant an easement; so, the
                    billboard owner wins.

    b.  ***Schwab v. Timmons*** (Wisc. 1999) -- *Easements created by
        necessity and implication*. Land beneath bluffs was owned by the
        Gov't, which then broke them up into separate parcels. π owned
        two of the parcels. The parcel of π's property above the bluffs
        has access to a road but π sold it off to relatives and then no
        longer has access to the road (inconvenient to get to the road
        from below the bluffs even if relatives are cool with using
        above-the-bluffs parcel to get to the road). π's property is now
        landlocked, so π wants the right to extend a road across
        adjacent property to the south, ∆'s property, that is also
        beneath the bluffs but has access to a road.

        i.  The court says no to extending road since no easement is
            possible.

            1.  There is no easement by grant (if there had been an
                easement by grant across the ∆'s property, then no
                problem, but there was no easement by grant because π
                and ∆ never cut a deal; they may have tried to, but they
                never did).

            2.  Sometimes, courts will say there is an easement despite
                the absence of a grant.

                a.  One way is an **easement by implication**:

                    i.  Implied easements exist in the law to protect
                        people who are purchasing land in subdivided
                        property from being surprised that no easement
                        actually exists when it would have been
                        reasonable for them to have thought one existed.

                    ii. Requirements for implied easement:

                        1.  **(1)** **Obvious use**---the use that would
                            be permitted by the easement---**prior to
                            the separation of the parcels**.

                        2.  **(2)** Necessity: without the easement, the
                            grantee of the property, the person who
                            acquired the subdivided property, can't
                            enjoy the property for the purposes to which
                            similar property is customarily devoted
                            (i.e., subdivision in a beachfront
                            community; ppl buy in, expecting to access
                            the beach; prior to subdivision and sale,
                            ppl could walk in certain places to access
                            the beach).

                            a.  Note this def'n of 'necessity' is
                                broader than the def'n used in easements
                                by 'necessity.'

                    iii. The requirements for implied easement were not
                         met here: the original subdividing was in 1854
                         and at that time there was no use of the road.

                b.  Another way is **easement by necessity**:

                    i.  Requirements:

                        1.  **(1)** There originally was a common owner
                            of all the plots;

                        2.  **(2)** The owner of the parcels severed one
                            portion by conveying it to other people;

                        3.  **(3)** The severed portion is landlocked by
                            which is meant no access to public road.

                        4.  Under these conditions, an easement by
                            necessity will be created to grant access to
                            a public road.

                    ii. All these requirements were not met here. The
                        first element is met b/c gov't owned everything
                        previously. Second element, owner severs portion
                        conveying it to others, also true: owner severed
                        off the upper portion of parcel, selling it to
                        others. Third element: although the severing
                        creates a landlocked parcel, it's [not the
                        severed portion that was
                        landlocked]{.underline}; the portion the π
                        retained is landlocked.

                        1.  Thus, π cannot get easement by necessity.

                            a.  And, even if π could have gotten one (by
                                keeping upper part and selling lower
                                part), the easement would have simply
                                allowed the relatives---now on the lower
                                part---access to upper road (not the
                                lower road).

                    iii. Court says the geographic obstacles were not
                         enough to create an easement by necessity,
                         provided you can get access at reasonable
                         expense (i.e., installing some stairs).

        ii. Professor notes π had a **policy argument** that there
            should have been an easement here: the policy that we
            shouldn't have useless land trumps everything else.

            1.  Court says the actual governing policy here is in favor
                of **transparent property rights**. Ppl buying property
                need to be able to know what they're getting or not
                getting (i.e., what easements might be limiting
                property). While easements by grants are written down in
                the county land registry, easements by necessity or
                implication aren't written down anywhere until courts
                have issued judgements on them. Thus, people can't know
                or not know when they're buying land with easements.

            2.  Moreover, when π sold off property, he could easily have
                created an easement by reservation (grant) that
                preserved his access to the upper road.

    c.  ***Warsaw v. Chicago Metallic Ceiling*** (Cal. 1984) --
        *Prescriptive easements*. Two adjacent lots in an industrial
        warehouse area: one north, one south, and a road that runs
        between them. π bought one of the lots and built a large
        warehouse on it, but the 40-foot-wide driveway was not wide
        enough to provide access to a loading dock for trucks. To allow
        trucks to turn around and position themselves to unload; π used
        some of ∆'s property abutting the driveway, having trucks drive
        on ∆'s side while unloading, for seven years. π twice tried to
        get an easement by grant to permit driving over ∆'s land; ∆ said
        no; this didn't stop π from continuing to have trucks use ∆'s
        land. After 7 years, ∆ made a plan to build a warehouse on its
        property, including the portion being used by π. π brought an
        action for injunctive relief. ∆ kept building anyway.

        i.  Trial court said either there's an easement permitting
            trucks to cross the property line or there isn't and this is
            trespassing.

            1.  Easement by grant?

                a.  No. π tried but ∆ wouldn't grant one.

            2.  Easement by implication?

                a.  No. There had been a prior sale but there had been
                    no prior use making the π reasonably expect to have
                    access.

            3.  Easement by necessity?

                a.  No. π's property is not landlocked; plenty of access
                    to the road.

            4.  Easement by prescription?

                a.  Yes. π had acquired a prescriptive easement over 25
                    feet of ∆'s land.

                b.  Trial court ordered removal of ∆'s newly constructed
                    warehouse.

        ii. Supreme Court affirms. Court lays out elements for creation
            of a prescriptive easement. There must be use that is:

            1.  **open and notorious**,

            2.  **continuous**,

            3.  **adverse**,

                a.  continues use without landowner's interference is
                    presumptively enough to show this was adverse, so
                    long as there's no evidence of permission

                    i.  Court said ∆'s refusal to negotiate for an
                        easement showed this.

                        1.  (Prof. notes this doesn't make sense: if the
                            ∆ had given permission, this could have
                            simply been a license; the ∆ might have been
                            willing to grant a license even though he
                            wasn't willing to grant an easement since
                            licenses are revocable at any time. If
                            license had been granted, this would have
                            been permission, then this wouldn't have
                            been adverse; moreover, this would have
                            allowed the property to be used, one of the
                            concerns of property law).

                            a.  Court may have just missed this.

                    ii. Just as with AP, permission will defeat
                        adverseness.

            4.  **uninterrupted for 5 years**,

            5.  **definite line of travel** (with minor variations
                allowed)

        iii. In this case, the relevant statute in Cal. followed the
             common law rule that says you can get a prescriptive
             easement without compensation---so ∆ wasn't even
             compensated.

             1.  Some jurisdictions may require compensation for
                 prescriptive easements.

        iv. No compensation for having to remove the building
            either---can't block the easement.

            1.  Court says there might have been compensation if ∆ had
                been innocent but he wasn't innocent since building
                started after π filed suit.

        v.  Concurrence notes the legislature had changed the law to
            allow owners of property to avoid the creation of
            prescriptive easements simply by posting a sign.

            1.  i.e., ∆ could simply have posted a sign saying right to
                pass requires permission.

        vi. Note differences with AP are: no exclusivity (i.e., many
            different ppl can be making use of the property in this
            way); the time requirement may differ (typically shorter);
            these are characteristics of the use that is made rather
            than possession that is made.

        vii. How to stop formation of **prescriptive easements**:

             1.  Show interference---put up physical barriers, like a
                 fence or stationed security guards at the property line
                 to prevent trucks from driving.

             2.  Bring a lawsuit for trespass.

             3.  Create a license\--∆ could have granted a license to
                 allow trucks to temporarily use property to back into
                 the warehouse. A license is revocable so ∆ could have
                 revoked when it wanted to build.

a.  ***Holbrook v. Taylor*** (KY 1976) -- *easement by estoppel*. ∆ gave
    permission to some coal miners to cut a road across his property in
    order to transport coal out of a mine. Coal miners paid ∆. The road
    then ceased to be used for a while. 20 years later π bought property
    next to ∆ and got ∆'s permission to use its roadway to haul
    construction materials back and forth and also gave permission to
    repair the road. After π's construction was complete π continued to
    use the ∆'s roadway. ∆ later said he wanted to make using the road
    official in writing; π claimed ∆ was trying to get \$500 for access
    to the road. π refused to pay. (Big gamble considering π just built
    a house and that if court rules for ∆, then it's confirmed π doesn't
    have access to the road, and so he'd have to pay to build another
    road). ∆ uses self-help: blocks the roadway with steel cables. π
    sues to establish right to use roadway.

    i.  Was there a prescriptive easement?

        1.  Court says no b/c road had been used with permission so
            therefore it wasn't adverse.

        2.  Also, the use might not have been continuous.

    ii. Nevertheless, there is **easement by estoppel**.

        1.  ∆ is estopped from revoking license to use the roadway b/c ∆
            knew that π was incurring significant expense in reliance on
            the road. π had built a house and improved the road.

    iii. Court wants to avoid the potential for exploitation---this is
         often the motivation for courts creating easements by estoppel.

         1.  i.e., the party who relied could be in really bad shape if
             there's a negotiation since they might have far more at
             stake having relied on the use of the property. This can be
             unfair.

    iv. The basic conditions required for the creation of **[Easement by
        Estoppel]{.underline}** are as follows:

        1.  **(1)** owner must have given someone permission to use the
            owner's property in a specified way---this creates a
            license. **Permission**.

        2.  **(2)** it must be the case that a reasonable person would
            not have thought that the permission would be revoked.
            **Reasonable expectation**.

        3.  **(3)** the recipient of the permission must have spent
            money as a result of reasonably relying on the permission.
            **Detrimental reliance**.

        4.  When this happens, the permission is no longer revocable;
            the person who would like to revoke the license is estopped
            from doing so.

b.  ***Fontainebleau Hotel v. Forty-Five Twenty-Five*** (Fla. 1959) --
    *Negative Easement*. Two luxury hotels in Miami Beach. Fontainebleau
    wanted to build a 14-story tower and Eden Roc sought an injunction
    because it would block the sunlight to their pool area during the
    winter months from 2pm onward.

    i.  Court references Sic Utere Principle: Use your own in such a way
        that you don't harm someone else.

        1.  Principle doesn't mean that one can never do anything that
            interferes with a neighbor's use but only that one can't do
            something that interferes with a neighbor's lawful rights.

            a.  i.e., a limited prevention of interference.

    ii. **Negative easements** allow the holder of the easement---the
        dominant tenant---to require that the servient tenant not do
        certain things on his own property, things that might harm the
        interests of the dominant tenant.

        1.  i.e., I can stop you from doing something on your property
            that ordinarily you'd be allowed to do.

        2.  Four categories---to stop the subservient tenant from:

            a.  \(1\) Interference with sunlight falling on windows.

            b.  \(2\) Interference with flow of air in a defined
                channel.

            c.  \(3\) Interference with flow of water in an artificial
                channel.

            d.  \(4\) Removing lateral supports to buildings.

        3.  In order for the Eden Roc to be the beneficiary of an
            easement over the Fontainebleau's property, it must be the
            case that such an easement can exist. **But unimpeded
            sunlight falling on sunbathing areas doesn't fall within any
            of the four permitted categories of negative easements.**

            a.  So therefore, there can't be a negative easement of that
                sort.

        4.  If a structure is useful, it doesn't give rise to a COA for
            cutting off light, air, or view of another, even if it's
            done partially for spite.

        5.  Malicious things done solely to injure a neighbor's land
            aren't allowed.

            a.  i.e., "spite fences."

            b.  Some states will prohibit owners from building or
                maintaining walls or fences if both of the following are
                true:

                i.  \(1\) They are intended to block a neighbor's
                    windows, and

                ii. \(2\) They provide no benefit to the builder besides
                    enjoyment of the neighbor's suffering.

                iii. In *Himan* case, the owner tried to put up poles to
                     show he was using property where airplanes were
                     flying but the court struck these down as spite
                     fences.

                iv. (generally, this law is infrequently applied since
                    most fences have at least some value/use---here,
                    creating additional rooms for a hotel has use)

c.  Prof's exercise on creating easements happens in the 3/11 lecture at
    1:39

2.  Termination of Easement

    a.  **Express Termination**

        i.  Termination by deed: the parties just agree to end the
            easement

            1.  i.e., two parties negotiated an easement; the one pays
                the other some money for the right to cross property;
                then the arrangement is not working out so well for
                whatever reason; and the parties come to an agreement
                where the easement is eliminated (possibly by paying
                money).

        ii. Termination by merger: when two parcels have come under the
            ownership of the same person, the easement across the parcel
            ceases to exist.

            1.  i.e., I own parcel A and you own parcel B. I want to get
                an easement of access across your property. I pay you
                money; you give me an easement; now I can cross. Later,
                I buy parcel B from you. So now I own parcel A and B and
                both parcels are owned by the same person. When this
                happens: the easement disappears; it's just gone, by
                merger.

                a.  If I then decide to sell the chunk that used to be
                    parcel B, once that happens---and parcel A and B are
                    separated again---**that easement on parcel B no
                    longer exists since it had disappeared by merger**.
                    If I want the easement, I'll have to negotiate, or
                    it will have to be created in some other way.

        iii. Adverse possession

             1.  i.e., there was an easement of access and someone
                 builds a house over where the easement was and is there
                 for a long enough period, the easement can be adversely
                 possessed---since an easement is a property right it
                 can be adversely possessed just like any other property
                 right. The easement then simply goes away.

        iv. No longer necessary: easement was created for a particular
            purpose that is now obsolete.

            1.  Easements by necessity automatically terminate if the
                necessity ends.

            2.  i.e., If the property stops being landlocked, there's no
                longer an easement by necessity.

        v.  Implied abandonment through nonuse: easement can be
            abandoned through (1) nonuse PLUS (2) affirmative acts that
            clearly manifest the intent to no longer use the easement.

            1.  For this to happen, mere nonuse by itself is not enough.
                It is not enough that the person simply stopped using
                the easement. Instead, it's got to be nonuse plus some
                affirmative acts that manifest the intention to clearly
                relinquish the easement.

            2.  i.e., if I had an easement of access across the eastern
                edge of your property---so I could just walk along the
                eastern edge---and then I built a wall along the
                property border b/t your property and my property, and
                that wall blocked access to that easement, and I didn't
                put a gate there; then I'm no longer using the easement
                and putting up a wall that makes it impossible for me to
                access the easement is an affirmative act that clearly
                manifests the intent not to use the easement.

                a.  Courts tend to disfavor these types of claims

        vi. NOTE: changed circumstances generally don't allow
            terminating easements, with one exception: if the easement
            was stated in terms of particular purpose that is now
            obsolete.

            1.  i.e., I negotiate an easement to go onto your property
                b/c your property had a big hill on it overlooking a
                baseball stadium. Then the team moves to a different
                location, so the stadium is no longer
                there---circumstances have changed. Since the easement
                was expressly stated in terms of a purpose---watching
                baseball games---that is not obsolete, the easement is
                likely terminated.

    b.  **Termination by Misuse**

        i.  Easement can only be used for original dominant parcel; it
            cannot be used for any additional parcel acquired (i.e., if
            you purchase the adjacent land). Just increasing the use of
            the easement by itself is not a misuse.

        ii. ***Penn Bowling v. Hot Shoppes*** (D.D.C. 1949) -- π, Penn
            Bowling, sold a parcel of its land to ∆, Hot Shoppes; in
            doing so, Penn Bowling reserved an easement of access to the
            road enabling travel from the road to the remaining Penn
            Bowling parcel (PB 1). Later, Penn Bowling bought an
            adjacent parcel (PB 2) and built a building that---although
            small enough to have fit within PB 1---straddled both
            parcels. Penn Bowling used the easement for transportation
            in and out of the new building, bringing in business
            supplies, taking out trash, etc. Many years later, Hot
            Shoppes physically blocks access to the easement. Each party
            sues for injunction.

            1.  Hot Shoppes claims that they're entitled to have blocked
                the easement because the easement doesn't exist
                anymore---it's been lost through misuse (uses a few
                arguments):

                a.  Penn Bowling forfeited the easement by expanding its
                    use in connection with other parcel (i.e., the new
                    building was on both PB1 and PB2).

                b.  Penn Bowling misused the easement by parking on it
                    (i.e., not just driving).

                c.  Penn Bowling's own building made use of the easement
                    for access impossible (i.e., because of the way the
                    building was placed---right up against Hot Shoppes
                    property line, cars accessing the loading dock could
                    not actually drive on to PB's property before
                    loading and unloading). Thus, the use of the
                    easement for access to PB1 was now impossible.

                    i.  Counter: Penn Bowling says: sure, the trucks
                        aren't accessing PB1 but the stuff inside the
                        trucks is accessing PB1; so, there's plenty of
                        access going on---this is an easement of access,
                        and the cargo is accessing through the easement.

                    ii. Counter to counter: when the trucks are loading
                        and unloading, the trucks are effectively
                        parked, which is not what the easement was for
                        (the easement was for traveling through for
                        seconds not for standing with the cars for many
                        minutes).

            2.  The court says:

                a.  Expansion of use of the easement **is
                    permissible**---more intensive use is fine, provided
                    the easement's terms don't prohibit it (i.e., if the
                    easement said only truck a day is allowed).
                    Expanding by itself it not enough to constitute
                    misuse.

                    i.  Note: in some jurisdictions there is a
                        reasonableness standard for too much usage of an
                        easement.

                b.  Use of an easement with additional parcels **is not
                    permissible**.

                    i.  Here, Penn Bowling is using the easement in
                        connection with both parcels because they're
                        using the easement to access a building which is
                        on both parcels. Use with an additional parcel
                        is not permissible.

            3.  What happens if there's misuse of an easement?

                a.  The easement can be temporarily enjoined until the
                    burden if lifted.

                    i.  So, whatever the misuse is, you can get a
                        temporary injunction that prevents use of the
                        easement until the misuse stops.

                    ii. The easement can be preserved if you can sever
                        the additional impermissible use, the misuse.

                b.  But if it's impossible to use it without misusing
                    it---if it's impossible to sever off the increased
                    burden that constitutes misuse, then the easement is
                    lost altogether.

            4.  Here, the court doesn't extinguish the easement
                altogether because it was possible for Penn Bowling to
                stop using the easement with respect to the portion of
                the building that was on PB 2.

                a.  This would require remodeling, but it was possible.

            5.  Was parking a misuse of the easement?

                a.  Fact question: must be determined on remand.

            6.  Did Penn Bowling make use of the easement for access
                impossible b/c of building?

                a.  Fact question: must be determined on remand.

                    i.  Possible arguments above.

            7.  Why does it make sense that if the building was slightly
                moved such that it was all on PB1 there would have been
                no issue?

                a.  Just because a building this size could have fit on
                    PB 1 doesn't mean that the party granting the
                    easement would have foreseen the easement being used
                    to also access a building of this size.

                    i.  i.e., this rule decreases uncertainty and makes
                        it more predictable what the burden of the
                        easement will be when parties are negotiating.

            8.  Rule: use in connection with another parcel is misuse.

***C. Covenants***

1.  Overview:

    a.  If easements are about the **right to go on land**; covenants
        are about the use or nonuse of land.

    b.  A covenant is an enforceable contract/promise to do or not do
        something in connection with your land.

        i.  An example of a covenant would be a homeowner promising not
            to dry clothes on a clothesline (environmentalists often
            oppose these covenants since washers are
            inefficient---several states have passed laws prohibiting
            such covenants) or not paint his house yellow (i.e., in this
            subdivision no one will paint their house any color other
            than white or pale blue, to avoid really garish colors that
            might not be in conformity with the general attitude of the
            neighborhood).

    c.  Unlike easements, covenants are purely contractual and cannot be
        implied.

        i.  There is no such thing as a "covenant by prescription" or a
            "covenant by necessity" or a "covenant by estoppel."

    d.  Must be in writing **(Statute of Frauds applies).**

2.  There are two variation of covenants---the only difference is how
    they are to be enforced (what the remedy is if the covenants are
    breached). Of course, there will be some differences in what
    requirements need to be satisfied in order to get each of these.

    a.  **Real Covenants**: Seeking money damages.

    b.  **Equitable Servitudes**: Seeking injunctive relief (i.e., a
        court order saying "stop breaching the agreement).

3.  There is a question that arises when the property that is governed
    by covenants changes hands. Do these agreements bind successors? Are
    these agreements enforceable against later owners, even if those
    later owners had nothing to do with creating the covenants?

    a.  The technical way of phrasing this question: **Do these
        covenants run with the land? (i.e., do they bind successors?)**

        i.  Sometimes the answer is yes: the mere fact that you've
            acquired certain property means you're bound by these
            covenants, even though you nothing do with the creation.

            1.  Note that ordinary contracts don't bind successors in
                the same way.

4.  **A1-B1 HYPO from class** (1:18.17, 3/16)

    a.  Consider a scenario in which a person, A1, owns some land, and
        another person, B1, owns some land.

        i.  A1 enters an agreement with B1, a covenant: A1 promises B1
            that he will **not do 'x'** on A1's property.

            1.  'x' is whatever you like (i.e., not to plant pine
                trees).

        ii. If A1 were to start doing 'x' on the property, would B1 have
            a valid COA against A1? Yes: he entered into a binding
            agreement, promising not to do 'x', and he did 'x'.

        iii. But what if A1 sells the property to someone else, A2? Then
             suppose that A2 starts doing 'x' on the property. Can B1
             sue to stop A2 from doing 'x' on the property? B1 and A2
             have not entered into a contract. A2 never signed a
             document promising not to do 'x'.

    b.  Alternative scenario: same set up: A1 promises B1 that he will
        **not do 'x'** on A1's property.

        i.  This time, B1 sells the property to someone else, B2. If A1
            starts doing 'x,' can B2 enforce the agreement against A1?
            A1 does not have a contract with B2.

    c.  A third variant: same set up: A1 promises B1 that he will **not
        do 'x'** on A1's property.

        i.  A1 sells to A2; B1 sells to B2.

        ii. Then A2 starts doing 'x'. Can B2 enforce the agreement
            against A2, even though neither A2 nor B2 were parties to
            the agreement. Maybe they weren't even alive when the
            agreement was created.

5.  How do you figure out the questions asked in the HYPO?

    a.  B2 will be able to enforce against A2 **if the burden and the
        benefit of that covenant both run with the land**. If it runs
        with the land, B2 can enforce; if not, then he can't enforce.

    b.  Professor says it is perfectly sensible to draw these things out
        by hand.

    c.  First indicate for yourself who the parties are.

    d.  Step 1: figure out which party in this dispute is being
        benefited and which party is the burdened party (i.e., which
        party benefits from the covenant and which party is burdened by
        the covenant).

        i.  Burdened party is the party being forced to do or not do
            something.

            1.  Here, it's A1 because A1 agreed not to plant pine trees,
                not to do 'x' on his property.

            2.  A loses is something; he's constrained

        ii. Benefited party is the one who can stop the other party from
            doing 'x'

            1.  Here, it's B1 because B1 is able to stop A1 from doing
                'x' so he can prevent, for example, the growth of pine
                trees on the parcel.

            2.  B gets something.

    e.  Step 2: determine whether you're dealing with a real covenant or
        an equitable servitude.

        i.  Just ask the straightforward question: is the remedy sought
            money damages or injunction?

            1.  If it's money damages, then you're dealing with a real
                covenant.

            2.  If it's an injunction, then you're dealing with an
                equitable servitude.

    f.  Step 3: figure out whether you need to have a burden running or
        a benefit running or both

        i.  \(1\) One sided question: **does the burden run?** (you
            don't need to worry about benefit running because the
            benefited party, B1, was an original party to the covenant).

            1.  **A1 is transferred to A2 and B1 is trying to enforce
                against A2.**

        ii. \(2\) One sided question: **does the benefit run?** (you
            don't need to worry about the burden running because the
            burdened party, A1, was an original party to the covenant).

            1.  **B1 is transferred to B2 and B2 is trying to enforce
                against A1**.

        iii. \(3\) Do both the **benefit and the burden run**?

             1.  **A1 is transferred to A2, B1 is transferred to B2.**

             2.  Even if you're in a situation where you have both the
                 benefit and the burden needing to run, ordinarily, if
                 you're doing the analysis, you want to start with
                 whether the burden runs because it's harder for burdens
                 to run than for benefits to run.

             3.  On the exam, do both analyses.

**Real Covenants (seeking money damages): break it down into two
separate questions: (1) Did the burden run? (2) Did the benefit run?**

1.  Horizontal privity is relatively difficult to establish. It's a
    common obstacle to the burden running for a real covenant because
    the succession of estate may not be as common as you would think or
    least as you may hope.

    a.  **A1 and B1 merely being neighbors does not qualify**.

        i.  If A1 and B1 are neighbors, they can of course enter into a
            covenant. But if they want that covenant to run with the
            land, they're out of luck because they are just neighbors
            and thus do not have horizonal privity.

    b.  Note the casebook thinks notice is a characteristic of equity
        and thus only applies to equitable servitudes. Traditionally,
        notice was not required in determining whether the burden or
        benefit of a covenant runs with the land. This seems crazy b/c
        if A2, for example, has no idea and couldn't have known.

        i.  Nemo dat principle: no one gives what he doesn't have. If A1
            transferred one of the rights in his bundle to B1, then this
            right simply isn't in A1's bundle anymore. Thus, when A1
            transfers ownership to A2, all A2 can acquire is the bundle
            that A1 had. A2 doesn't get the missing stick. A2 can't
            acquire the right to do 'x' on that property.

        ii. This result is quite harsh.

        iii. Professor thinks notice matters because of an economic
             notion called "pricing in."

             1.  If A2 knew that the parcel was burdened by a rule
                 saying you can't do 'x' on the parcel, then A2 would
                 presumably be willing to pay less for the parcel---A1
                 and A2 would negotiate differently.

             2.  It's not unfair to burden A2 so long as A2 had notice
                 b/c then A2 would be able to negotiate a lower purchase
                 price.

             3.  Prof. notes that this reasoning makes no reference to
                 whether the remedy is money damages or an injunction.

                 a.  Hornbook law today typically agrees with prof:
                     notice is one of the requirements for the burden of
                     a real covenant to run.

    c.  Standard way to have privity is grantor/grantee. So, common way
        for horizontal privity to exist is when someone own property, a
        big parcel, they're estate developer, and they subdivide it, and
        when they subdivide it, they create a new subdivision, and they
        enter into an agreement with all the first ppl who purchase the
        lots and the buildings on site. So, there's now horizonal
        privity b/t the developer and each of those ppl who have
        purchased into the property.

        i.  i.e., this is likely what happened in *Kingsbury Place* and
            *Eyerman*.

    d.  This isn't what happened in Shelley, which was just a bunch of
        neighbors who decided they didn't' want to have a racially
        integrated neighborhood and created a covenant to prevent this.

        i.  Horizonal privity wouldn't matter because they were seeking
            an injunction not money damages so the requirements for
            equitable servitudes were what mattered, not real covenants.

            1.  Exception to rule that neighbors can't enter into real
                covenants is straw transaction (i.e., all neighbors sell
                their property to lawyer's secretary who then
                immediately sells it back to them, imposing the
                covenant).

2.  Why is notice not required for benefits of a real covenant? It's
    less important to make sure people didn't get extra benefits.

3.  NOTE: Diagonal privity is not a thing---there are no lines between
    A1 and B2, for example.

**Equitable Servitude: (Seeking injunctive relief)** **(Same as real
covenants analysis except no privity).**

1.  ***Tulk v. Moxhay*** (Eng. 1848) -- *creates equitable servitudes*.
    π sells garden in Leicester square with provision in land sale
    agreement that the purchaser and his successors will maintain the
    square's garden and not build on it. ∆ later purchases the square
    garden from the (second owner) and knew about the agreement but
    decides to build on it anyway. π original owner seeks injunction to
    stop ∆ from building.

    a.  Court says the issue not whether the covenant (original
        agreement) runs with the land (but doesn't explain why).

        i.  The requirements for the burden of a real covenant to run
            with the land

            1.  Writing -- yes, it was on the deed.

            2.  Intent -- yes, the original agreement said it was
                explicitly to apply not only to the original purchaser
                but also to "his heirs and assigns."

            3.  Touch and concern -- (i.e., did it affect the parties'
                relations as landowners?): presumably yes, the agreement
                is limited to what can be built on that particular
                parcel (so it's touching and concerning the land).

            4.  Horizontal and vertical privity

                a.  Horizontal: right kind of relationship b/t original
                    parties to the agreement

                    i.  In English law at the time, the only way to
                        satisfy horiz. privity was w/landlord-tenant
                        relationship (a lease). Sales didn't
                        qualify---grantor-grantee was no good.

                    ii. Thus, no---the burden doesn't run.

                    iii. i.e., this is why equitable servitude ditches
                         the privity requirement.

                b.  Vertical: non-hostile nexus b/t A1 and A2; complete
                    succession of estate.

                    i.  Yes, one party just bought the land from the
                        other party.

            5.  Notice -- yes, ∆ said he knew.

    b.  What about easements?

        i.  No, this would need to be a negative easement (you can't do
            certain things on your land). Only four categories: (1)
            sunlight on windows; (2) air in a defined channel; (3) water
            in an artificial channel; (4) lateral support. This isn't
            about any of these it's about what you can build on a plot
            of land.

    c.  Court says the agreement is enforceable on another theory when
        the purchaser had notice of the burden.

        i.  Court says yes, this is a court in equity; the agreement is
            enforceable despite the lack of horizontal privity because
            the person took with notice.

            1.  Court created the equitable servitude.

    d.  Policy Justifications:

        i.  \(1\) if the court didn't issue an injunction and stop the
            building, it would be impossible for an owner of land to
            sell part of it without incurring the risk of rendering what
            he retains worthless.

            1.  i.e., if you sell part of a chunk of land to someone
                else, you're worried about what the other person is
                going to be doing on that land because they might do
                something that's obnoxious and makes your land much less
                pleasant or valuable.

                a.  Some uses are obnoxious enough that they will
                    qualify as nuisances and therefore will be
                    prohibited.

                b.  Other uses, even if not nuisances, may violate
                    zoning laws (not yet invented in England).

                c.  If you can't ensure preventing obnoxious use of land
                    after you sell it, then you might not be willing to
                    sell, and property law favors transfer of land
                    because it ensures the land belongs to the highest
                    value user.

                d.  Here, the covenant wouldn't be enforceable b/c
                    grantor/grantee was not protected.

                    i.  To avoid this, court creates equitable
                        servitude---if the person had notice we'll
                        enforce it.

        ii. \(2\) unjust enrichment: the cost of complying with that
            burdensome covenant was priced into the defendant's purchase
            price. Not unfair to ask someone to comply if he gets a
            bargain by virtue of the thing being burdened. If the burden
            is lifted, you paid a lower price for something that's now
            worth a whole lot more.

            1.  Prof. notes it's weird for the court to mention this
                after saying the restriction wasn't enforceable b/c
                presumably the buyer could know it wasn't enforceable,
                thus it wouldn't be priced into the purchase.

2.  ***Neponsit Property Owners v. Emigrant Bank*** (NY 1938) --famous
    *for liberalizing touch and concern, making it much easier to
    satisfy*. Residential subdivision. The original sale had an
    affirmative covenant to pay money dues to homeowners' association
    that would maintain for public spaces like roads and parks. ∆-bank
    bought land from one of the original purchasers but didn't want to
    pay the fees; so, homeowners' assoc. sued to foreclose on bank's
    property.

    a.  The covenant was for things done in connection with the land but
        weren't done on the land. None of what the dues paid for
        actually occurred on the bank's parcel. Does an agreement
        requiring payments for neighborhood maintenance "touch and
        concern" the land?

        i.  Court endorses Professor Bigelow's famous def'n of touch and
            concern: A covenant touches and concerns the land if it
            effects the parties' advantages and disadvantages as owners
            of particular parcels rather than just as members of the
            community in general.

            1.  So, it's got to affect your advantages and
                disadvantages, your benefits, and burdens, as owning
                particular land.

            2.  "Does the covenant impose on the one hand, a burden upon
                an interest in land, which, on the other hand, increases
                the value of a different interest in the same land or
                related land."

            3.  Prof lee: does the covenant decrease in one way the
                value of owning a parcel and also increase in another
                way the value of owning that parcel or increase the
                value of owning a different but related parcel?

                a.  Does the covenant make owning this parcel less
                    valuable in one way but also either make the parcel
                    valuable in another way or make owning a related
                    parcel more valuable?

        ii. This is not talking about the land---the thing that's owned;
            but instead, is talking about the burdens and benefits of
            ownership, the legal relationship you have with the land. By
            virtue of owning this, you receive something nice but also
            have this other unfortunate thing to deal with.

            1.  Different from things physically touching and concerning
                the land.

    b.  The covenant does satisfy the touch and concern requirement b/c
        the original conveyance didn't just give title to the land, but
        also gave a right of common enjoyment to roads, beaches, public
        parks, etc. So, even though the things being paid for aren't
        actually on the land, you enjoy these benefits by virtue of
        owning the land.

        i.  Likewise, even though paying money to the homeowners' assoc.
            isn't really a thing you do on your land (i.e., you can
            write the check from anywhere), this burden on you comes by
            virtue of your owning that particular land.

        ii. This now allows for a whole range of stuff as long as it
            applies to you by virtue of you owning the land. You now
            must work pretty hard to think of things that wouldn't
            "touch and concern" the land.

            1.  i.e., maybe compulsory fees to maintain a golf course
                that is far away (i.e., land in NY, golf course in
                Hawaii) from the burdened lot. Since it's far away, the
                golf course being better maintained doesn't really
                qualify as a benefit of ownership.

            2.  Main takeaway: yes, is almost always the answer to touch
                and concern.

    c.  Keep in mind (two different aspects to benefit and burden): with
        respect to figuring out "touch and concern," there's a burden
        and there's a benefit. The burden is having to pay the HOA fees.
        The benefit is enjoying the parks and roads and so forth. We've
        also been talking about the benefits of burdens and benefits
        running in the context of real covenants and equitable
        servitudes---this is a separate issue, where the burden is the
        burden of paying the HOA dues and the benefit is the benefit
        that the HOA receives from getting the HOA dues.

3.  ***Sanborn v. McLean*** (Mich. 1925) -- *the notice requirement*.
    ∆-married couple wants to build a gas station on their lot in a
    residential subdivision, but neighbors are opposed. When πs and ∆s
    trace their titles to proprietors of a residential subdivision that
    had been divided years earlier; they find a covenant in the original
    purchasing that limited land for residential purposes (also required
    that residences must cost a certain amount, keeps out the riff
    raff). But: the restrictive covenant was not in ∆'s deed. So, they
    start building; but then they are enjoined from continuing.

    a.  Does this negative covenant run with the land? Hinges on the
        notice requirement. **Actual notice is sufficient but not
        necessary.** Did the πs have constructive notice even though the
        covenant wasn't included in their deed?

        i.  Court says yes: there was constructive notice**.
            Constructive notice** comes in two varieties, **record
            notice** or **inquiry notice**.

            1.  Was there record notice? No. It wasn't written in the
                deed.

            2.  **Was there inquiry notice? Yes. (sometimes courts
                require that you had to check)**

                a.  Uniformity of compliance; general plan and the deeds
                    were restricted to carry out the plan (this is shaky
                    since some deeds didn't include the restriction)

                b.  Plan was repeatedly declared in deeds for subsequent
                    sales of original lots (although, again, not for
                    everyone).

                c.  Even purchasers of lots with deeds not containing
                    the restriction observed the general plan.

                d.  ∆s are the first to depart from the plan in 30
                    years.

    b.  ∆ was on inquiry notice b/c of all the uniformity and should've
        done more (i.e., check the records of neighboring parcels).
        **Burden was on the buyer to check.**

    c.  **Prof notes**: how much investigating should purchasers have to
        do? What if observed uniformity was accidental? (i.e., just no
        one had wanted to put in non-res. property); also, how many of
        their neighbors' deeds did they need to check? What if they
        checked one that also didn't include the restriction?

        i.  On the other hand, does it really make sense to allow a
            glitch in the recording of deeds to allow a purchaser to do
            something he shouldn't really be allowed to do? Neighbors
            made assumptions that they were buying into a residential
            neighborhood.

    d.  Note: the writing requirement is satisfied b/c the original
        agreement was in writing but when it came time to record that
        agreement, somebody screwed up and didn't put it in all the
        deeds.

4.  **Terminating Covenants**

    a.  **Negotiating a release**

        i.  Problems with this method because holdouts and high
            transaction costs.

        ii. Also, expiration dates.

    b.  **Abandonment** (court steps in to terminate the covenant)

        i.  Abandonment by means of widespread prior violations require:

            1.  Violations that eroded the general plan

            2.  They have been habitual and substantial

            3.  As a result, enforcement of the covenant would be
                inequitable.

        ii. Rationale---does not reward people for violating covenant;
            encourages neighbors to bring claim against violator instead
            of waiting (on the other hand, should you have to sue
            anytime someone violates the covenant? Lawsuits are
            expensive).

            1.  Note, could be viewed as punishing minority of ppl
                following the rules; also, should we enforce something
                when only a minority ppl wants to stick it out.

        iii. ***Peckham v. Milroy*** (Wash. 2001) -- Women opens a day
             care in a subdivision where there was a restrictive
             covenant on businesses in the subdivision. Neighbor was
             annoyed by all the kids, so he sues. She argues that there
             were several other houses that been continuously violating
             the restrictive covenant (there were already businesses in
             the area); thus, the covenant had been abandoned.

             1.  Court says no abandonment since abandonment by prior
                 violations requires that the prior violations have all
                 three of the following characteristics:

                 a.  \(1\) Violations that eroded the general plan, and

                 b.  \(2\) They have bene habitual and substantial, and

                 c.  \(3\) As a result, enforcement of the covenant
                     would be inequitable.

             2.  Here, the violations were **not habitual and
                 substantial**: only 4/1600 plots in the subdivision
                 violated the covenant.

                 a.  Requirement not satisfied, so covenant was
                     enforced.

    c.  **Changed circumstances** (court steps in to terminate the
        covenant)

        i.  Deed restrictions are unenforceable when, by reason of
            changed circumstances, enforcement would be:

            1.  \(1\) inequitable

            2.  \(2\) enforcement would harass the burdened party; and

            3.  \(3\) Enforcement would not benefit the adjoining
                landowners

                a.  Not measured only in terms of market value; benefits
                    can include ability to enjoy the property without,
                    for example, additional traffic and annoyance
                    stemming from commercial businesses in an area meant
                    for residential use.

        ii. **OR** if changed circumstnaces have rendered the purpose of
            restrictions obsolete.

        iii. **Purpose of the doctrine of changed circumstances**:
             Covenants can last a long time and the developer who
             creates them may have incorrectly predicted the future
             (i.e., poconos springs case where developer misjudged the
             demand for vacation homes). Additionally, if the only way
             to get out of a covenant is to agree with everyone in the
             subdivision, there will be holdout problems.

        iv. ***Bolotin v. Rindge*** (Cal. 1964) -- Wealthy neighborhood
            in Cal; subdivided in 1920s; subdivision with restrictive
            covenant (set to expire in 1970; note: expiration is one way
            of dealing with problem of changed circumstances that a
            covenant that made sense in one context might not make sense
            decades later) that each lot shall be used only for single,
            private residences. Π owned an unimproved lot in the
            subdivision and wants to put up a commercial building, which
            would violate the covenant (didn't want to wait 6 years). π
            said lot is not suitable for single, family residence and
            its best use is for a commercial building and would not
            adversely affect property values and commercial was
            happening nearby already. ∆ argues a commercial building
            will make homes on the lot less desirable and market value
            will decrease.

            1.  Court says: changed use nearby had left the lot with no
                substantial value for single family residences
                (worthless if left only for this purpose). But, if used
                for a commercial building, it would be worth \$200k.

            2.  Refusal to enforce the covenant wouldn't adversely
                affect neighbors' property values.

            3.  **RULE:** A deed restriction will be deemed
                unenforceable by reason of changed circumstances if
                either of the following is true:

                a.  \(a\) changed conditions have rendered the
                    restriction's purpose obsolete OR

                    i.  i.e., if the restriction was imposed for the
                        benefit of a lot that itself has violated the
                        restriction; then the owner of the lot violating
                        the restriction can't sue to enforce the
                        restriction against others. (if you put up a
                        commercial building yourself you can't sue
                        someone else trying to put up a commercial
                        building)

                b.  \(b\) when enforcement of the covenant has all of
                    the following three features:

                    i.  \(1\) enforcement would be **inequitable**; and

                    ii. \(2\) enforcement would **harass** the burdened
                        party; and

                    iii. \(3\) enforcement would **not benefit adjoining
                         landowners**.

            4.  Court applies rule to facts:

                a.  Part (a) -- changed conditions rendering the purpose
                    obsolete is not true here. The ppl who didn't want
                    the office building owned residential property.

                b.  Part (b) isn't satisfied either b/c the third
                    element isn't satisfied, that enforcement would not
                    benefit adjoining landowners.

                    i.  Even though this doesn't affect market values of
                        neighbors, it affects their comfort and
                        enjoyment. Thus, enforcement *would benefit* the
                        neighbors.

                    ii. Market value could increase even though living
                        in the neighborhood has become less pleasant
                        (perhaps speculation that commercial property is
                        going up raises values but lowers benefits).

                        1.  Remands to have trial review possible
                            non-market value losses.

**II. Nuisance**

***A. Overview***

1.  Covenants and easements are one way of proactively addressing
    potential conflicts among neighbors, preventing conflicts before
    they arise by deciding in advance what sorts of uses of property
    won't be allowed. Another way to deal with land use conflict is to
    **deal with them after the fact, *ex post* rather than *ex ante*;
    address conflicts once they've arisen**. **Nuisance law** is one way
    the law does this.

2.  Trespass deals with physical incursion on property, interference
    with possession by intruding on property. Trespassing limits one's
    exclusive possession; this is true whether or not you suffer any
    actual harm. If trespass is about possession, **nuisance deals with
    conflicts among uses**.

    a.  For trespass, incursion is enough for you to get damages; for
        nuisance, you need to prove actual and substantial injury.

3.  Nuisance arises when my use of my own property interferes with your
    use of your own property.

    a.  The more development you get, the more ppl are packed in near
        each other, the increased risk that you will have conflicts
        among uses.

4.  To constitute a nuisance, the harm must affect use or enjoyment of
    neighboring property such that it:

    a.  \(1\) produces a tangible and appreciable injury to the property
        OR

    b.  \(2\) renders the property's enjoyment uncomfortable or the use
        inconvenient.

5.  3 steps to determine nuisance:

    a.  **(1)** is there a prima facie case of nuisance?

    b.  **(2)** are there defenses?

    c.  **(3)** If not, is there a remedy?

***B. Cases***

1.  ***Campbell v. Seaman*** (NY 1876) -- *reasonable use*. ∆-Seaman
    owned land on the Hudson River; intermittently, Seaman used the land
    for a brickyard; *but no brickyard for an extended period*, during
    which π-Campbell bought adjacent land and built an expensive home
    nearby and improved his land with trees. Seaman then started burning
    bricks again, which damaged Campbell's trees (but not all the time).
    Other neighbors also burned coal and bricks.

    a.  General discussion of nuisance: is there a prima facie case?

        i.  **Every person has the right to make reasonable use of his
            land as it serves him best, so long as it does not
            unreasonably interfere with his neighbor's land (i.e., his
            use or enjoyment).** Sic utere principle: use what's yours
            so as not to damage others.

            1.  But this principle does not prohibit ALL injuries to
                others because that would be (1) unenforceable; and (2)
                by not preventing ANY injury to others, other people are
                compensated by the advantages of civilized society
                (**Reciprocity of advantage**: some things ppl do that
                are costly, the law is not going to worry about or
                interfere with because even though the activity imposes
                costs on others, those ppl also benefit from being able
                to do those things).

                a.  Sic utere principle, by itself, taken literally,
                    could not work since it's impossible for everyone to
                    use their properties in ways that never impose any
                    costs on anyone else.

                b.  What the rule really is: **landowner must make a
                    reasonable use of his property so as to occasion no
                    unnecessary damage or annoyance to his neighbor**.
                    What's reasonable depends on the circumstances.

    b.  **[How to determine reasonable use]{.underline}** (i.e.,
        determining if there's a **prima facie case**)

        i.  **Locality Rule**: use of property in one locality that
            could be lawful and reasonable in one circumstance could be
            unlawful and unreasonable---a nuisance---in another
            circumstance in a different locality.

            1.  Quote from Village of Euclid: "A nuisance may be merely
                a right thing in a wrong place, like a pig in the parlor
                instead of in the barnyard."

        ii. **Amount of harm the activity is causing**: πs have to show
            a significant level of injury.

            1.  Quote from the court: "tangible or appreciable injury...
                the use must be such as to produce a tangible and
                appreciable injury to neighboring property or such as to
                render its enjoyment specially uncomfortable or
                inconvenient."

            2.  Here, even though the smoke was intermittent, it was
                often enough.

                a.  Thus, the brickyard was a nuisance.

                b.  Keep in mind: something naturally occurring---like a
                    hot spring---does not qualify as a "use" (which is
                    artificial).

    c.  **[Defenses to nuisance]{.underline}**:

        i.  **Coming to the nuisance**: if π coming to nuisance showed
            up after the objectionable activity was already occurring,
            then the π cannot prevail on nuisance claims. ∆'s activity
            that was causing the interference started before π. Effect
            is that whichever conflicting use started later loses.

        ii. The court rejects this defense (courts generally are
            reluctant to accept it):

            1.  Rationale: one should not be able to control neighbor's
                future use (i.e., the factory owner spewing smoke should
                not control whether ppl want to put up houses next
                door). The brick burner cannot prevent neighbor from
                planting ornamental shrubs. (*Campbell*)

            2.  Criticism: under current law this defense may be
                wasteful because it encourages wasteful races to be the
                first user. Being first is just one factor but not
                determinative.

            3.  Prof Lee: Isn't the tree planter also trying to control
                the brick burner's future use? Either result is that one
                cannot plant trees in the future or that the other
                cannot burn bricks in future. The question becomes which
                party should be able to control the other's use.

                a.  Notes the Coase theory: no one person causes
                    nuisance; this is only a problem b/c of how Campbell
                    uses his property---if he was burning bricks, no
                    problem (this argument is controversial).

        iii. Instead of having a crisp, coming to the nuisance test,
             courts include this factor in balancing other factors:
             timing---who was there first (the above); good faith/spite;
             public interest in ∆'s activities; estoppel (detrimental
             reliance).

        iv. **Estoppel/Acquiescence:**

            1.  easement by estoppel permits something would otherwise
                be a nuisance (i.e., π should've said something before ∆
                reasonably relied by buying brick making machinery;
                therefore, π is estopped from complaining).

                a.  Not true in this case: When π bought property, ∆ was
                    not burning bricks so there was no implicit
                    permission. Then, once ∆ started burning bricks π
                    complained. ∆ did not incur major expenses in
                    reliance on π's permission.

                b.  Detrimental reliance is a component; i.e., if ∆ was
                    led to believe this was ok.

        v.  **Prescriptive Easement:**

            1.  Permits you to do something on someone else's property
                that you otherwise wouldn't be able to (i.e., walk
                across someone's property OR commit a nuisance by
                emitting smoke over their property).

            2.  No prescriptive easement because it fails the continuity
                requirement: there was a statute of limitations of 20
                years and the brick burning did not occur for 20
                years---he stopped intermittently (thus this defense
                could not be claimed).

    d.  **[Remedy for Nuisance]{.underline}**: (π has won, it's a
        nuisance, what does he get? Campbell wants injunction)

        i.  Injunction **may be claimed** to avoid **(1)** interminable
            litigation in a multiplicity of suits (i.e., *Howard v.
            Baker*) or **(2)** irreparable injury (damage that cannot be
            remedied by money damages) (both satisfied here)

            1.  Multiplicity of suits is satisfied because π would bring
                suit every time the wind blew to his property.

                a.  Prof. notes the court doesn't address that one lump
                    sum for permanent damages could have been used; ex:
                    Golden Press (i.e., the money damages effectively
                    granted a permanent easement to encroach little bit
                    over property line)

            2.  Irreparable injury is satisfied because "a jury cannot
                assess a price for beauty and luxury."

                a.  i.e., trees can't be immediately replaced with money
                    since they take long to grow. Also, the gas would
                    kill new trees anyway.

        ii. Injunctions **may be denied** based on **balance of
            hardships.** If it would be excessively burdensome to **∆**
            OR to **society** in light of minor injuries to π, court
            will not grant injunction.

            1.  Does not apply here because balance does not favor ∆; he
                can make bricks elsewhere

            2.  The injunction will not limit the brick making trade in
                general or harm society in general.

2.  Prof. Lee's hypothetical: 1:24:51 (3.23):

    a.  Does a COA exist to enjoin a nuisance for a proposed cremation
        establishment in a rural residential area under averments from
        the residents of the area that it will cause mental anguish,
        depressed feelings, physical discomfort, and lower property
        values?

    b.  Step 1: Is there a prima facie case?

        i.  Determine reasonable care:

            1.  Locality Rule: does this seem like this would be
                appropriate in the area?

            2.  Actual damages: does this seem like a significant amount
                of harm? (lower property values; ppl are just creeped
                out)

                a.  Keep in mind *you have to wait for actual harm to
                    occur* (even for lower property values; you can't
                    just be concerned that smoke will damage my trees in
                    the future)

            3.  If yes, then move to step 2

    c.  Step 2: Do any of the possible defenses apply?

        i.  coming to nuisance (if even available in the jurisdiction):
            no residential community was first.

        ii. promissory estoppel: has the person come to believe that you
            weren't going to stop them? No, it seems like the ppl
            started right away.

        iii. Good faith/spite: doesn't seem like this would be blocked
             out of spite.

        iv. Public interest: doesn't seem like public benefits of
            crematorium outweigh

        v.  prescriptive easement: probably not since the crematorium is
            new and this would need to have been going on for a while.

        vi. No defenses apply; move on to step 3.

    d.  Step 3: Would injunctive relief be available here?

        i.  Injunction may be claimed to avoid **(1)** interminable
            litigation in a multiplicity of suits or **(2)** irreparable
            injury (damage that cannot be remedied by money damages)

            1.  \(1\) maybe; (2) maybe ppl are really bothered and being
                given money doesn't fix this.

        ii. Injunctions may be denied based on **balance of hardships.**

            1.  If it would be excessively burdensome to ∆ in light of
                minor injuries to π, court will not grant injunction.
                Can subjective feelings be involved in balancing?

3.  ***Adams v. Cleveland Cliffs*** (Mich. 1999) -- Ties together two
    doctrinal areas: *trespass and nuisance*. Cleveland Cliffs operated
    large iron mine, which employed 2,000 ppl. Some of expansions to
    mine occurred after πs bought their homes. πs filed suit for
    nuisance and trespass, claiming mine blasting operations produced
    physical harms (plumbing leaks and breaks), psychological harms
    (nervousness and sleeplessness); financial harms (diminished home
    resale values; at times unmarketable). Trial court couldn't decide
    on nuisance. Awarded damages for trespass.

    a.  Were the jury instructions on the statement of trespass correct
        where it said that every unauthorized intrusion onto lands of
        another is a trespass on those lands?

        i.  Does trespass apply to sound waves, noise, and dust?

    b.  Court says these are nuisance claims, not trespass claims.

        i.  Requirements for trespass:

            1.  Invasion of your property with both of the following
                characteristics:

                a.  **(1) Done by a physical, tangible object**, AND

                    i.  I throw a frisbee onto your property.

                b.  **(2) Invasion is direct**

                    i.  No intervening force causing the thing to go
                        onto the property. (i.e., I'm on the public
                        sidewalk tossing a frisbee, and a gust of wind
                        blows the frisbee onto your property---no
                        trespass)

            2.  If you establish a trespass you receive at least nominal
                damages no matter how small the actual injury is
                (nominal damages can make punitive damages
                possible---i.e., *Jacque*)

        ii. Here, the court **"liberalizes" directness**: direct means
            the invasion occurs by the means the defendant knew or
            should have known---*knowledge to a substantial
            certainty*---would result in physical invasion of
            plaintiff's land.

            1.  Different than traditional requirement (i.e., I might
                know with substantial certainty that, on a windy day, a
                gust of wind will come along and eventually blow the
                frisbee away)

            2.  Might be satisfied here: mine blasting might cause these
                invasions with substantial certainty.

        iii. Here, tangible object requirement is not satisfied.

             1.  Noise and vibrations are not tangible

             2.  Dust is ordinarily not a significant physical
                 intrusion.

                 a.  If there had been a lot of dust, πs would have a
                     nuisance claim.

        iv. Requirements for nuisance (what would need to be satisfied
            here):

            1.  **One approach (not Campbell; mention on exam)**: there
                must be a balancing test involving the value of the
                social activities (is society better off if we allow the
                activity and allow the harms or if we avoid the activity
                and the harms?).

                a.  How beneficial is the activity?

                b.  How detrimental are the harms?

            2.  Damages for nuisance: In order to get damages, you must
                show actual and substantial injury. (i.e., if Jacques
                were stuck with a nuisance claim, might've gotten
                nothing)

4.  **4 tests to distinguish trespass from nuisance (first option:
    favors finding trespass; second option; favors finding nuisance;
    some court use one, some another, some a combination)**

    a.  \(1\) Was the defendant's act **on** the plaintiff's land or
        **outside** the plaintiff's land?

    b.  \(2\) Was the harm **direct** or **indirect**?

    c.  \(3\) Was the invasion by **tangible matter** (test is: are the
        invading items individually visible to the naked eye; dust? No.
        Light, photons of light? No.) or **intangible matter**?

    d.  \(4\) Did the plaintiff **lose possession**, or did they
        **merely lose enjoyment**

    e.  NOTE: For trespass, just incursion is enough to get nominal
        damages. For nuisance, you need to prove actual and substantial
        injury to get damages.

C. **Calabresi and Melamed: *Property Rules, liability Rules and
Inalienability: One View of the Cathedral***

1.  Intellectual motivation for paper: in ***Campbell v. Seaman***, the
    court remarked that: "the law will not compel a person to take money
    rather than objects of beauty and utility which he places around his
    dwelling to gratify his taste or to promote his comfort and his
    health."

    a.  When should the law require people to take money in exchange for
        something that they own? When should people be allowed to refuse
        to take money in exchange for relinquishing what they own?

    b.  Courts face two decisions in deciding who will prevail when
        interests conflict, i.e., when deciding how to allocate
        entitlements.

2.  **2 big questions courts face when deciding how to allocate
    entitlements**

    a.  \(1\) Who gets the entitlement? (i.e., who wins) Plaintiff or
        Defendant.

        i.  Assigns entitlements to π or ∆ based on efficiency,
            distribution, other justice considerations.

    b.  \(2\) How should that entitlement be protected? What form of
        protection? **Property rule protection**, **liability rule
        protection**, or **inalienable entitlements**.

        i.  Motivating these distinctions is the idea that when a court
            issues a ruling that doesn't end the story. Parties will
            then bargain among themselves to exchange entitlement.

            1.  If a court says A has a right to exclude B and B
                nevertheless wants to go on A's property, the result of
                this may not be that A excludes B; the result may be
                that B pays some money to A in order to get A's
                permission to go onto his property. People reach deals.

            2.  So, there's often post-litigation bargaining. When one
                person wins and another loses in court, this sets the
                grounds for negotiation. Then the parties decide how to
                allocate rights based on who's willing to pay how much
                to whom.

                a.  Projections of outcomes also shape pre-litigation
                    negotiation.

            3.  Distinction b/t property rules and liability rules
                concerns the way price is determined. So, if the
                entitlements change hands by voluntary arrangement, how
                is the price at which they change hands determined?

3.  Two basic possibilities for determining the price at which an
    entitlement (stick in the bundle) will change hands. (i.e., maybe I
    can buy a stick in your bundle, but how is this determined?)

    a.  Price is determined by the person who holds the entitlement.
        I've got to pay you whatever you want. If I'm unwilling, then I
        don't get the entitlement.

    b.  Price is determined by someone else. Someone else sets the price
        and if I'm willing to pay then I get the entitlement.

4.  Distinction between property rules and liability rules

    a.  If an entitlement is **protected by a** **property rule**, then
        someone who wishes to buy that entitlement can do so only if the
        entitlement holder agrees on a price. Voluntary transaction.
        Can't be acquired without entitlement holder's consent---you pay
        whatever price that person wants. ***Pile v. Pedrick*** --
        Pedrick will have to pay whatever price Pile asks for to keep
        encroachment, because otherwise Pedrick will have to remove
        encroachment (i.e., he can probably for hold out for a price as
        high as it would cost Pedrick to remove the foundation)

        i.  Property rule protection: commonly associated with
            injunctions: if I can get an injunction against you doing
            something then the only way you can do it is by convincing
            me to allow you to do it. (i.e., by paying whatever price I
            demand).

    b.  **Liability rule protection** is associated with money damages:
        a court places a price on the interference with the entitlement,
        which may or may not be the same price that the victim would
        have demanded. ***Golden Press***, price of the interference --
        court says all you can get is money damages at the market rate.
        This effectively means the factory was allowed to encroach so
        long as it was willing to pay the money damages approach (\$55).
        This may be substantially less than the value the plaintiff
        would have demanded in a voluntary transaction.

        i.  If one party wants to acquire an entitlement from another
            and the entitlement is protected by a liability rule, the
            first party may acquire it by paying an "**objectively
            determined value**." (i.e., not the parties themselves
            determining the price, the court, often using fair market
            value)

    c.  **Inalienable entitlements**: transfer is not permitted at all;
        even if both parties agree, courts will not allow entitlements
        to change hands. (i.e., your autonomy is inalienable, you can't
        sell yourself into slavery, i.e., law licenses---you can't sell
        these to someone else)

5.  ***Boomer v. Atlantic Cement*** (NY 1970) -- A cement plant injured
    neighboring properties through dirt, smoke and vibrations. Neighbors
    seek injunction and damages. Presence of a nuisance is not disputed.
    The only issue is what remedy should be awarded, injunction or
    damages. Court granted only liability rule protection against a
    nuisance: a polluter had to pay damagers but could continue to
    pollute.

    a.  Court says that traditional rule in NY about injunctions is that
        nuisances shall be enjoined (note this isn't what *Campbell*
        said). If you prevail on a nuisance claim, you get an
        injunction, even if doing so is very economically costly.

    b.  Court decides not to use traditional rule: instead, wants to
        balance the effects of granting an injunction: the total damage
        to π is relatively small compared to the value of the ∆'s
        operation.

        i.  If permanent damages were awarded (single dollar amount to
            compensate for all of the injury caused by the nuisance
            interference), these were estimated to be about \$185,000.

        ii. Injunction would also be very costly: issuing the injunction
            would require Atlantic Cement, if it wanted to keep
            operating, to reach deals not only with just this particular
            π but with all local residents because any of them could
            bring a nuisance suit. (any π can get an injunction and shut
            down the entire factory). Any π could also hold out
            strategically.

            1.  Assembly problems: you've got to get permission from a
                large number of people (takes time and money).

            2.  Holdout problem: people say no at first to extract
                really large payment.

    c.  When a court is figuring out should it use **property rule
        protection** or **liability rule protection** (i.e., which mode
        of protecting the entitlement should it use), one standard
        analysis says: make the decision based on whether you're in
        circumstances with low transaction costs or high transaction
        costs.

        i.  If transaction costs are low, consensual exchange is
            possible; straightforward, so use a **property rule
            protection**, which promotes efficiency. The parties will
            bargain and whoever is willing to pay more will end up with
            the entitlement.

        ii. If transaction costs are high, things get a lot more
            complicated, but it may be more efficient to switch to a
            **liability rule** because then there are impediments to
            bargaining and so it may be more efficient to just have the
            court step in and specify a price for which the entitlements
            will change hands.

    d.  Here, the court affirms that it was right not to issue a garden
        variety injunction to enjoin the nuisance b/c this would require
        immediately closing the plant. Question is: how to avoid this
        drastic consequence. Two possible alternatives:

        i.  Grant an injunction but postpone its effect for a fixed
            period of time (i.e., if you're still emitting fumes, noise,
            vibrations, if you're still causing a nuisance in time X in
            the future, then you're enjoined).

            1.  Allows anti-pollution technology to advance.

        ii. Grant an injunction unless the defendant pays permanent
            damages, compensating plaintiff for the present and future
            loss. A one-time payment (would preclude future suits).

    e.  Court rejects first option b/c who knows when/if technology will
        improve.

    f.  Second option makes more sense: shut down or pay damages, so
        factory pay damages.

    g.  **Liability rule protection**: *if you can pay the money, you
        can keep doing it:*

        i.  The result is basically the factory gets an easement to
            continue doing the nuisance. An element in the property
            owner's bundle of rights has now been transferred to the
            factory. Factory owner is now entitled to commit the
            nuisance. And what is the price of it which changes hands?
            The price is equal to the money damages award. If factory
            pays this amount, it acquires that stick in the bundle.

    h.  Policy question: Should the court address this particular
        dispute between these particular parties as equitably as
        possible or should the court resolve the case in a way that
        addresses worthy public goals?

        i.  Court says it should focus on addressing the dispute
            equitably since they are not well-equipped to deal with big
            policy questions involving air pollution (this is
            legislature and executive's job).

            1.  Some nuisance suits address CO2 emissions.

**III. Zoning**

***A. Overview***

1.  Zoning is the regulation of land uses through a general regime
    permitting and forbidding particular use of land in particular
    locations. The goal of zoning is to exclude nuisance from certain
    areas. Zoning is one type of land use regulation---there are also
    environmental regulations and historic preservation regulations. A
    "special exception" is an exception written into a zoning ordinance.
    A "variance" is when a person requests an exception to a zoning
    restriction.

2.  Nuisance law deals with conflicts between neighbors on a piecemeal
    basis. Another way is by means of having government regulation.
    Impose rules that govern entire categories of situations. Not an
    agreement by the parties; rather, the government steps in and say
    this is how it's going to be.

3.  These kind of zoning ordinances, zoning rules, government
    regulations, might have prevented some of the conflicts, some of the
    nuisance cases we've seen so far by, for example, limiting where
    brickworks could be brought or where cement plants were allowed to
    operate.

4.  Zoning is done by law. One thing that happens when zoning laws come
    into existence is that people who are going to be inconvenienced by
    the law may seek to avoid it. There are two possible legal methods:

    a.  Try for a **special exception**: a carve out in the ordinance
        itself (i.e., the law says you can't build more than 15 stories
        tall, but there's an exception for one building that can be
        built that high---this is a **special exception** written into
        the law itself).

        i.  To find out which special exceptions exist simply read the
            law.

    b.  Seek a **variance**---an exception for hardship: not written
        into the law. Done on a case-by-case basis.

        i.  There's a procedural framework that exists for contesting
            zoning decisions. If you're unhappy with a city official's
            zoning decision on your property, then you can take your
            complaint to a board of zoning appeals, an administrative
            court like the appeals court.

            1.  If you don't like this decision, you take that decision
                and appeal it into the state court system. And then you
                litigate it.

5.  ***Village of Euclid v. Ambler*** (1926) -- Zoning ordinance
    established 6 zones for uses of land (i.e., use-based zoning). 1 to
    6 went from most pleasant to least. U1-single family homes, public
    parks, et al. only; U2-duplexes; U3-apartments, schools, churches,
    hotels, museums, hospitals, et al.; U4-banks, offices, restaurants,
    theaters, retail stores, gas stations, fire and police stations, et
    al.; U5-warehouses, billboards, laundries, auto repair shops,
    wholesale produce markets, et al.; U6-industrial, prisons, and
    cemeteries, et al. The zoning scheme was Euclidean and cumulative,
    so each category allowed the uses specified in each previous
    category (least intensive to most intensive). For example, U3
    allowed you also to have U1 and U2 uses built in that zone, but not
    U4-U6. π alleged that the zoning was facially invalid.

    a.  Zoning ordinance is valid against constitutional challenges; at
        least some zoning is permissible as exercise of state's police
        power.

        i.  Prof notes that lower court had made an economic justice
            argument against zoning on the grounds that it wasn't really
            an exercise of state police power but rather was merely a
            mechanism to screen out poor people.

    b.  How can you decide which zoning ordinances are allowed?

        i.  It varies with circumstances and conditions (i.e., a zoning
            ordinance that works for cities might be invalid if applied
            in a rural setting).

        ii. Zoning survives constitutional scrutiny as long as it is:
            "fairly debatable."

            1.  As long as it passes a rational basis test.

            2.  Zoning is constitutional "unless it is clearly arbitrary
                and unreasonable" and has no relation to the health,
                safety, and welfare of the people.

    c.  Here, zoning is constitutional against a facial challenge, even
        though the zoning required compliance with use that was
        different from the use already going on in the neighborhood
        along the southern edge of the lot.

        i.  General trade and commercial was ordinary use in the
            neighborhood but that was zoned for duplexes and
            single-family homes. So ordinary commercial activity
            couldn't be allowed there.

            1.  Reasonable enough, says the court. The fact that some
                industry *isn't* harmful is irrelevant; the fact some
                industry *is* harmful is good enough.

            2.  Regulation was well within its rights to exclude certain
                types of development such as apartment buildings in an
                area of residential homes because the desirability of a
                neighborhood is greatly diminished by apartment
                buildings (traffic, noises, etc.)

    d.  "Euclidean Zoning" -- **means use zoning**: **restricting what
        uses can occur in what parts of town**.

        i.  It is not zoning for height or area. (height and/or area
            zoning, i.e., you can't build more than 8 stories here; over
            there not more than 10 stories).

        ii. Need not be cumulative zoning, even though it was here.

    e.  Note: ***Nectow v. Cambridge*** (1928) -- as applied challenges
        (i.e., the law is unfair in how it is being carried out), you
        may have a chance with; facial challenges, very unlikely.

6.  **Exception for** **non-conforming uses**: When a zoning ordinance
    is enacted on areas that are already developed, what happens to
    things that are already there but are not in compliance with the new
    zoning law? A use that is being used in a way that was already used
    before the ordinance was imposed is usually grandfathered in and can
    continue. But, only existing uses---not lots---are protected.

    a.  Cannot switch uses and you can't build something that violates
        zoning on a vacant lot just because the lot existed before
        zoning. The only thing that is grandfathered in is the use.

    b.  For example, you own a mechanic shop before the implementation
        of the zoning ordinance in zone U1. You can continue to operate
        the mechanic shop. If you sell the property, the new owner can
        also continue running the mechanic shop. However, you **cannot
        switch uses**, i.e., close the mechanic shop and open a baker in
        zone U1.

    c.  Another example: zoning ordinance says you can't build taller
        than 10 stories and there's an 18-story building on the lot when
        the law is enacted. That 18-story building will generally be
        grandfathered in. This use pre-existed the ordinance, and is a
        non-conforming use that is allowed.

    d.  **Amortization**: some jurisdictions have adopted amortization,
        which means that the non-conforming use fades out over time.
        After some period of time, you have to conform to what the
        zoning ordinance requires.

        i.  Otherwise, the non-conforming use may never fade out since
            it can be highly profitable to be the only type of business
            in an area (i.e., only gas station in a residential area).

7.  **Exclusionary Zoning**: some of the earliest zoning targeted the
    characteristics of users rather than the characteristics of
    uses---this zoning explicitly enforced racial and economic
    segregation. Supreme Court struck this down as unconstitutional in
    *Buchanan v. Warley* (1917): cannot impose zoning restrictions that
    separate characteristics of users; violates due process by limiting
    the ability of sellers to sell to whomever they wanted.

    a.  But zoning might nevertheless still be implicitly motivated by
        discriminatory purposes; even zoning ordinances without
        discriminatory intent might have discriminatory effects.

    b.  ***Southern Burlington County, NAACP v. Township of Mount
        Laurel*** (NJ 1975) -- In an effort to be fiscally prudent and
        preserve its tax base, Mt. Laurel entered into deals with
        housing developers that created incentives for developing
        expensive housing; in this way, the city would generate higher
        tax revenues from residents. Another effect was to ensure that
        low income and middle-income people could not afford to live
        there.

        i.  Court strikes down the zoning ordinance: the city is
            required to make a variety of housing realistically
            possible. There is a presumptive obligation not to make
            housing impossible for low- and middle-income people.

            1.  This could make it impossible for lower paid employees
                of industries a region has eagerly sought to live in the
                community where they work.

                a.  Every developing municipality must bear its *fair
                    share*.

        ii. Prof Lee: What is the *fair share*? Can courts do a good job
            of answering these questions? Is changing the zone ordinance
            the best solution? Why can't fairness be accomplished by
            taxing employers and requiring them to pay money (since
            they're not paying employees enough to live close by), which
            the city would then turn into subsidies for low-income
            housing? (i.e., housing vouchers)

            1.  Case highlights how there can be a genuine menu of ways
                to solve problems and raises questions about how
                problems are best addressed and who's best situated to
                solve them.

            2.  Case is an outlier in terms of its result.

8.  General view: zoning is popular and ubiquitous---a certain amount of
    separation of uses is good for society. It's intuitively, very
    compelling.

    a.  Bob Ellickson: while zoning is very popular, it has a bunch of
        bad effects and you can reach similar results simply by having a
        **combination of nuisance law and private covenants** (i.e.,
        Houston, Texas, famously doesn't have zoning).

        i.  Once concern is **Rent-Seeking**: Lobbying to get a benefit
            for yourself. If the gov't is set up such that it doles out
            benefits, picking winners and losers, then, while this has
            benefits, one cost is that it encourages people to lobby the
            government: i.e., expend resources to ensure the gov't makes
            you a winner.

        ii. Because zoning is administered through a central authority,
            those with more power and influence are more likely to
            benefit from zoning (i.e., state legislatures are often
            greatly influenced by big, wealthy, developers) than those
            with less power and influence.

            1.  Concern of "capture"---when gov't is captured by the
                very organizations they regulate.

    b.  On the other hand: private ordering isn't perfect either. Adam
        Smith: "people of the same trade seldom meet together even for
        merriment or diversion."

    c.  Fundamental question: To what extent does gov't regulation, in
        this case, of land-use, do a better job than private decision
        making, say, through covenants? Answer depends on the
        circumstances.

**[Forms of Ownership Across Persons and Time]{.underline}**

**I. The Law of Future Interests and Estates**

***A. Overview***

1.  We've discussed the "bundle of rights" theory for thinking about
    property. Some of the elements in this bundle are temporal sticks,
    elements that are defined by extension through time.

2.  The law governing time length of ownership is the **law of future
    interests**. It is possible under the law to give people possessory
    rights for only a specified period of time and then give other
    people potential possessory rights for later in time, all the while
    retaining certain possessory rights for one's self for still later
    in time.

***B. Estates***: property rights defined in terms of their duration
through time; temporal measure of a property right.

1.  **[Present Possessory Interest]{.underline}**: an interest in
    property that gives you the right to possess now, in the present.
    There are **five** kinds of possessory interests.

    a.  **Fee Simple Absolute**: The largest package of ownership rights
        you can have. Everything else is carved out of the fee simple
        absolute, everything else is less than a fee simple absolute. It
        had no contingencies; it lasts forever. If you transfer property
        and you don't specify otherwise, it is presumed you are
        transferring a fee simple absolute.

        i.  Indefinite in time; runs to infinity.

        ii. "Grant of Blackacre to Jones."

        iii. As long as you are alive, you may have "heirs apparent,"
             but you do not have any heirs. Only dead people have heirs.
             Living people have "heirs apparent." This means that "To
             Jones and his heirs" really means the same thing as "To
             Jones" because Jones has no heirs while he's alive.

        iv. Plural is: **Fees Simple Absolute**.

    b.  **Life Estate**: doesn't last forever; an interest in property
        that gives the holder the right to possess the property but that
        right terminates automatically upon the death of a named person
        (not necessarily the person holding it); an estate that exists
        only as long as a certain person specified is alive; hence "life
        estate," an estate for life.

        i.  Can be transferred; alienable (able to be transferred) by
            gift or by sale.

        ii. If transfer happens, you can create a situation in which you
            have a **Life estate pur autre vie**: "life estate by
            another life;" a life estate that's measured by the life of
            somebody other than the person who holds it.

            1.  If I grant to A Blackacre for life ("to A for life"),
                then A has a life estate in Blackacre for as long as A
                is alive. But A can transfer this life estate to B. If
                this happens, then what B acquires is also a life
                estate---nemo dat---but it's a life estate measured not
                by B's life but by A's life. When A dies, the life
                estate ends, not when B dies.

        iii. With respect to the burden of real covenants running with
             the land, *vertical privity will not be satisfied if
             someone with a fee simple absolute grants a life estate to
             someone* because there wouldn't be complete succession of
             estate.

             1.  If A1 owns Blackacre in fee simple absolute, and then
                 transfers a life estate (rather than a fee simple
                 absolute) to A2, this isn't complete succession because
                 the life estate does not last as long as the fee simple
                 absolute (this is only partial succession of estate).
                 This would fail vertical privity.

    c.  **Defeasible fee**: Allows for ownership to change if some
        specified event occurs; but whether the event will ever actually
        occur or not is uncertain. If it does happen, the estate is
        terminated; but if it doesn't happen, it's not terminated. In
        contrast to a life estate, which will inevitably end (since
        everyone dies); with defeasible fees, you don't know if they
        will ever terminate. As a result, many state statutes require
        defeasible fees to be limited in their duration (i.e., not more
        than 30 years). Defeasible fees exist to enable original
        grantors (creators of these interests) to make two choices:
        **(1)** Who gets the property, the possessory interest, if the
        triggering event occurs, the original grantor or third party?
        **(2)** Does the transfer occur automatically or can the
        recipient (original grantor or third party) decide whether or
        not to accept the interest? Once you've answered these two
        questions, that determines which sort of defeasible fee---which
        come in three varieties---you want to create.

        i.  **Fee simple determinable**: ends automatically if a named
            event occurs (the named even is often something stopping
            happening---cessation of a condition).

            1.  Created using ***durational language,*** language of
                time (as long as, while, until...).

            2.  i.e., "To Paramount pictures until Paramount stops using
                it to make Marvel Comics movies." Paramount has it.
                Maybe forever. But if it ever stops making Marvel Comics
                movies, then it loses it.

            3.  If the triggering event occurs, then automatically the
                interest goes back to the original grantor.

        ii. **Fee simple subject to a condition subsequent**: continues
            indefinitely until a named event occurs (just like a fee
            simple determinable); but if the named even occurs, it does
            not automatically end. Instead, the *original grantor can
            choose to end it*, via self-help or via lawsuit.

            1.  Terminated only if the triggering event occurs, and
                then, only if the person chooses to exercise the right
                to retake it.

            2.  Created via ***conditional language*** (But if, on the
                condition that, provided however, if...).

            3.  Ex: To Meghan Merkle, but if she ever becomes part of a
                foreign royal family, then the grantor has a right to
                reenter and retake the property.

        iii. **Fee simple subject to executory limitation**: Similar to
             other two defeasible fees; the difference is that if the
             triggering event occurs, the possessory right doesn't go
             back to the original creator. Instead, it goes to some
             third party.

             1.  Created by ***durational or conditional language***.

             2.  Ex: To Chelsea, but if she ever appears on reality TV,
                 then to Ivanka. That it might go to a third party,
                 Ivanka, and not the original grantor, is what
                 distinguishes it from fee simple subject to a condition
                 subsequent.

             3.  Appears to go (but not fully clear) automatically; no
                 choice by the third party.

2.  **[Future Possessory Interest]{.underline}**: When present
    possessory interests end (not fee simple absolute), somebody else
    will need to come on the scene, because the owner of the present
    possessory interest has lost it in the future. Corresponding to each
    present possessory interest (except fee simple absolute), there are
    future interests. Two varieties: 'reversionary' and 'in others.'
    **There will NEVER be a gap: there will never be a situation in
    which nobody has a possessory interest, a right to take**. It must
    always be the case that somebody can take. If there's a grant that
    doesn't explicitly lay out who can take any given time, then there's
    got to implicitly be someone there who can take. The Law doesn't
    want stretches of time where nobody has a possessory interest.

    a.  Reversionary: interests in the original grantor, the person who
        created the grant in the first place.

        i.  **Reversion**: goes back to the original grantor.

            1.  i.e., ***life estate*** goes back to the original
                grantor; the original grantor has a 'reversion.'
                Original grantor grants "To A for life." The grant
                creates a life estate in A and, implicitly, there is a
                reversion in the original grantor.

        ii. **Possibility of reverter**: Follows every ***fee simple
            determinable*** (and only the fee simple determinable; often
            referred to as: Fee simple determinable with possibility of
            reverter**).** Original grantor will automatically get the
            property back if the limitation built into the fee simple
            determinable occurs. It can be implicit (if the grantor of
            the fee simple determinable doesn't say what happens if the
            event occurs) or explicit.

            1.  Ex: To A as long as there is a train station on the main
                street (this language creates a fee simple determinable
                in A); if suddenly there is no train station on main
                street, the property goes back to the original grantor
                (the original grantor has a possibility of reverter).

            2.  Adverse Possession clock can start to run as soon as the
                train station ceases to exist (because the interest
                transfers automatically). Original grantor gets property
                back, but if A does not leave, he is trespassing---the
                AP clock starts running.

        iii. **Right of Entry/Power of Termination**: corresponds to a
             ***fee simple subject to a condition subsequent***. Goes
             back to the original grantor; but it's a right of entry or
             a power to terminate possession---the original grantor can
             choose to let the former possessor stay there. A right but
             not the obligation to retake if the trigger condition
             occurs (note: to exercise the right of entry, one typically
             needs to do so within a reasonable amount of time after
             trigger condition; otherwise, court may say you waited too
             long).

    b.  **Future Interests In other people**:

        i.  **Remainder**: follows a ***life estate*** (never a fee
            simple) and exists in a party other than the grantor. "To A
            for life, then to B"---creates a life estate in A and there
            is a remainder in B. (B doesn't have a reversion, since he's
            not the original grantor, he has a remainder).

            1.  Remainders can themselves be any form of these present
                possessory interests.

            2.  "To A for life, then to B," since there's no
                qualification, creates a life estate in A and a
                remainder in fee simple absolute to B.

            3.  To A for life, then to B for life, then to C," creates a
                life estate in A, and then a remainder in life estate to
                B, and then a remainder in fee simple absolute to C.

        ii. **Executory Interest**: for ***fee simple subject to
            executory limitation***, if the triggering event occurs, the
            third party who gets the property has an executory interest.

3.  p\. 521 of casebook has problems on these.

    a.  What interests are created in the following?

    b.  1\) O grants Blackacre "to A for life, then then to B and his
        heirs."

        i.  A: life estate. B: remainder in fee simple absolute (no
            condition or qualification).

    c.  2\) Same as in Question 1. Then C enters adversely. Then thirty
        years later C is still on Blackacre and A, still alive, has
        never entered.

        i.  A: no longer has anything. C: life estate pur autre vie in A
            (nemo dat: C can't take more from A then A had to transfer
            and all A had was a life estate ending when A dies). B:
            remainder in fee simple absolute. (if C remains after A
            dies, C is trespassing on B's fee simple absolute).

    d.  3\) O grants Blackacre "to A for life, then to B and her heirs;
        but if B ever remarries, then to C and her heirs."

        i.  A: life estate. B: remainder in fee simple subject to
            executory limitation. C: executory interest.

    e.  4\) O grants Blackacre "to Huxley College as long as it is used
        for instructional purposes."

        i.  Huxley College: fee simple determinable. O: possibility of
            reverter.

    f.  5\) O grants Blackacre "to A; but if marijuana is inhaled on the
        premises, then O shall have the right to reenter and take the
        premises."

        i.  A: fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. O: right of
            entry (power of termination).

    g.  6\) O grants Blackacre "to A; but if marijuana is inhaled on the
        premises during A's life, then to B and her heirs."

        i.  A: fee simple subject to executory limitation. B: executory
            interest.

    h.  7\) O conveys Blackacre "to A for life, then to B for life, then
        to C."

        i.  A: life estate. B: remainder in life estate. C: remainder in
            fee simple.

    i.  8\) O grants Blackacre "to A for life, then to B for life, then
        to B's children who survive him." ("who survive him" is a
        condition different from saying "to be and his heirs.")

        i.  A: life estate. B: remainder in life estate. B's children:
            remainder in fee simple. O: reversion.

            1.  \[Remember that there always must be someone who can
                take. If B's children all die before B does, then when B
                dies ownership must go somewhere. Thus, O has an
                implicit reversion. (If O is dead, the interest goes to
                O's estate)\]

    j.  9\) O grants Blackacre "to Springfield Hospital as long as it is
        used for the care of patients, then to Springfield Animal
        Clinic."

        i.  Hospital: fee simple subject to executory limitation. Animal
            Clinic: executory interest.

    k.  10\) O grants Blackacre "to A for life, then to A's husband if
        he survives her."

        i.  A: life estate. A's husband: remainder in fee simple. O:
            reversion

    l.  11\) O grants Blackacre "to A for life, then, if B passes the
        bar, to B and his heirs as long as he remains a member in good
        standing of the bar." B is a student in law school.

        i.  A: life estate. B: remainder in fee simple determinable. O:
            reversion and a possibility of reverter. \[Note that B may
            not pass the bar. Hence O has a reversion. (Because there
            must always be someone who can take.) But even if B does
            pass the bar, B could lose the property by ceasing to remain
            a member in good standing. Hence O also has a possibility of
            reverter.\]

**II. Mediating Conflicts Over Time**

***A. Doctrine of Waste: the default rule is that waste is prohibited,
but parties can contract to get around it.***

1.  Overview:

    a.  The ability to divide property rights across time gives rise to
        the possibility of conflicts across time among people who have
        different rights at different times.

        i.  Ex: Someone with a life estate in landscaped property with a
            bunch of ornamental trees, might cut down all the ornamental
            trees in order to get a better view of a building off in the
            distance. Even though this someone might be thrilled with
            his better view, the people who hold the remainders---who
            will receive the property after the holder of the life
            estate dies---might have preferred that the trees stay there
            and can't easily replace the threes since it takes long for
            trees to grow.

            1.  Note: the person who holds the remainder is "**the
                remainder man**."

        ii. The interests of these two people diverge. How does this get
            sorted out? One way the law tried to mitigate this
            divergence problem is through the doctrine of waste.

        iii. The law of waste is the default rule that applies unless
             the relevant rights holders agree to do something else.

2.  Types of Waste

    a.  **Affirmative Waste**: an affirmative bad action; doing
        something that is a bad action on the property. It is a use that
        is not normal and causes "excess" damages (Ex: chopping down
        ornamental trees).

        i.  A use that causes ordinary ware and tear is not affirmative
            waste; it's got to be a non-normal use that causes excess
            damage.

    b.  **Permissive Waste**: person with present possessory interest
        does not act when he should have; unreasonable failure to act
        that causes excess damages (failing to repair a leaky roof).

        i.  Again, allowing ordinary wear and tear isn't by itself
            waste; this must be unusual, unreasonable; failing to take
            reasonable actions to mitigate damage.

    c.  **Ameliorative Waste**: a significant change in the property
        that, although it's a change, increases the value of the
        property (unlike the other two which make property less
        valuable). Ameliorative waste has been traditionally prohibited
        but there is a modern trend toward allowing it when the
        circumstances have changed (i.e., sometimes you can do it, but
        not always).

3.  ***Brokaw v. Fairchild*** (NY 1929) -- Wealthy businessman Isaac
    Brokaw builds 4 mansions and gave each of his kids a life estate in
    one of the mansions. Each life estate had a remainder in each life
    tenant's issue (kids). If there was no such issue for a given life
    tenant (i.e., if one of Brokaw's kids didn't have kids), then that
    interest would go the issue of the other children (to the other
    grandkids). By giving his kids life estates with remainders in their
    kids, Isaac assured the mansion would stay in the family for at
    least one more generation (i.e., he didn't give his kids fee simple
    absolutes, which would have allowed them to sell their mansions).
    One of his kids, George, wanted to demolish his mansion and put up
    an apartment building because he could no longer afford the property
    taxes and could not find anyone to rent the mansion. George sued,
    seeking a declaratory judgement that he's allowed to knock down the
    building and put up an apartment building (which would greatly
    increase the value of the property). His siblings resist, arguing
    that demolishing the building would be waste (note the kids are not
    "Remainder Men;" they just don't want an apartment building nearby
    their mansions.)

    a.  Court says no: Isaac Brokaw's will clearly intended the
        residence to be part of the life estate, and the residence would
        no longer exist if it was replaced by apartments.

    b.  General rule: The life tenant may do whatever is required for
        the general use and enjoyment of the estate as he received it.
        The life tenant cannot act as if he owns the property---no right
        to exercise the act of ownership.

        i.  This means you can't do things like demolishing a house,
            which the court said would be an act of ownership or
            dominion rather than merely using the property.

        ii. The property must pass to the remainder men without any
            significant changes, otherwise it's waste.

    c.  Note: since rules of waste are default rules, George could have
        contracted with the remainder men to knock down the mansion if
        they were willing.

    d.  Even if everyone will be financially better off from the
        apartment, this is not the court's concern.

    e.  Prof Lee: increase in value cannot always be reduced to monetary
        value. Even though the property would have been canonically more
        valuable, there are other reasons (i.e., sentimentality) not to
        demolish.

        i.  Ameliorative waste -- even though it raises property value
            -- can still be a form of waste.

***B. Restraints on Alienation***

1.  Overview:

    a.  The advantage of allowing the transferability of property is
        that it allows reallocation of resources to the highest value
        users and it promotes owner autonomy---no longer shackled to
        property; you can get rid of it if you prefer.

    b.  Absolute restraints on alienation are void as against public
        policy.

        i.  Exception: Court will typically uphold limited restraints on
            alienation if the restraints are reasonably related to
            family estate planning.

        ii. Exception: certain inalienable rights; i.e., human bodies.

2.  ***Mountain Brow Lodge No. 82, Independent Order of Odd Fellows v.
    Toscano*** (Cal. 1967) -- Toscano gave a lot to the Odd Fellows. The
    grant was a defeasible fee---it provided that the lot would go back
    to Toscano if (1) the Odd Fellows sold or transferred any part it
    OR (2) if the Odd Fellows stopped using it for fraternal reasons.

    a.  The first provision was disallowed because it was a restraint on
        alienation. Odd Fellows argued that the two conditions were
        absolute restraints on alienation.

        i.  It says if you sell or transfer any part of it---if you
            alienate it---we get it back.

    b.  The second provision was allowed because it is a restriction on
        the *use* and not the *user*.

        i.  This is a valid fee simple subject to a condition
            subsequent. If the lodge stops using it for lodge purposes,
            it goes back to Toscano (at least he has a right to re-enter
            / power of termination).

    c.  Dissent: The second provision is a restraint on alienation
        because only the Odd Fellows can use it for the purposes Toscano
        identified. Therefore, they cannot transfer it to anyone else.

    d.  Prof Lee: one issue with defeasible fees that doesn't have a
        time limit on it: if the lodge disbands in 100 years,
        potentially you could have fragmentation of title among a whole
        bunch of different people, widely scattered heirs. If the
        property goes back to Toscano, Toscano is likely dead, so it's
        reverting to his estate, which would be Toscano's kids, who also
        might be dead. So, then it reverts to their estates---grandkids
        that might be spread all around the globe.

        i.  So, there would be an anti-commons (under-utilization b/c
            private ownership rights are too broadly distributed):
            fragmented rights to ownership with many people having to
            agree to deal, to decide. It's a mess.

    e.  Rule: Restraints on alienation are not allowed; however,
        restraints on uses are allowed in land grants.

**III. Mediating Conflicts Between Co-Owners**

***A. Concurrent and Marital Estates***

1.  Overview:

    a.  It is possible to have multiple property owners at the same time
        and even to combine them, i.e., to A for life, then to B and C→A
        gets a life estate, B and C together have the remainder in fee
        simple. It\'s also possible for A to own Blackacre in fee simple
        while B simultaneously has a life estate in Blackacre→ so,
        during B\'s lifetime, there\'s shared property rights.

2.  **Concurrent Interests**

    a.  **Tenancy in common**: arrangement where each tenant in
        common\'s interest is separate but undivided, meaning *each has
        an equal right to possess the whole* (neither can exclude the
        other from any part of the property); each tenant is a co-owner.

        i.  Separate interests -- each interest is independently
            alienable, meaning either tenant in common/cotenant could
            sell/give away/transfer his interest without getting the
            other\'s permission.

        ii. Tenants in common do not need to have equal shares
            (cotenants may have unequal rights to profit from or to rent
            the property (i.e., one gets 25% of rental income, the other
            gets 75%).

        iii. Tenants in common can have unequal responsibilities to pay
             taxes or pay the mortgage

        iv. No property rights again each other -- neither can demand
            rent from the other.

        v.  If the grant does not specify which tenancy it creates, it
            is presumed to be a tenancy in common.

    b.  **Joint Tenancy**: Similar to tenancy in common, but 3 big
        differences

        i.  *Right of survivorship*→ when one joint tenant dies his
            interest disappears and the other surviving tenant(s)\'
            interest increases proportionately. This happens regardless
            of what the deceased-tenant\'s will says.

            1.  Deceased tenant\'s interests are not passed to his
                children/heirs regardless of what the will says. If A,
                B, and C own Blackacre, and A dies, then B and C, who
                previously owned 1/3 of Blackacre, each now own ½ of
                Blackacre.

        ii. *Requires satisfying the four unities* → possession, time,
            title, interest (some states have begun to relax time and
            title restraint because of straw transactions).

            1.  Possession -- each joint tenant must have an equal right
                to possess the whole

            2.  Time -- each joint tenant\'s interest in the joint
                tenancy must have been established at the same time.

            3.  Title -- each tenant acquired his title via the same
                instrument or joint AP

            4.  Interest -- same legal interest (all have fee simple, or
                all have a life estate, or all have a lease)

        iii. Each joint tenant\'s share must be the same fractional
             size.

    c.  **Tenancy by the entirety** (available in approximately ½ of
        states): Available only to married couples. It is the same as
        joint tenancy in that it includes a right of survivorship and
        requires the same four unities *plus marriage*. Neither spouse
        can unilaterally transfer his/her interest in the
        property---both spouses must agree to any transfer. Tenancy by
        entirety also cannot be destroyed unilaterally---either both
        spouses sign a document terminating or it is automatically
        terminated if they get a divorce.

    d.  **Community property**: (alternative to tenancy by the entirety;
        a state will have one or the other but not both). All property
        acquired during marriage automatically becomes community
        property: There is an equal right to possess community property;
        alienation or encumbrance requires consent of both spouses.

        i.  If the spouses divorce, then community property is divided
            equally, 50/50, unless one spouse can show it is a separate
            property.

3.  **Ending a co-tenancy relationship/Resolving cotenant conflict**

    a.  In contrast to future interests, waste is generally disfavored
        as a remedy/COA in disputes among concurrent owners. Instead,
        the available remedy is **partition**.

    b.  **Partition**: the way to get out of a co-ownership. It is
        available to any co-tenant for any reason or for no reason at
        all. Cotenants in a tenancy in common or a joint tenancy have an
        automatic right of partition---they can just leave the
        co-ownership (at any time, for any reason or no reason at all).

        i.  **Two types of partition:**

            1.  Partition by sale: court sells the property at auction
                and divides the proceeds proportionately among the
                former cotenants.

            2.  Partition in kind: court physically divides up the
                property and each former cotenant ends up with a part of
                the property that had formerly been co-owned.

        ii. ***Delfino v. Vealencis*** (CT 1980) -- A parcel is co-owned
            and partition is available; the only question is how
            partition will be accomplished. 20.5 acres are owned by
            cotenants. Vealencis\' interest was 31%; she lived on the
            property and used it to run a garbage hauling business
            (would store the garbage trucks). Vealancis wants *partition
            in kind* so she can continue to live there and run the
            business using the divided chunk she\'s given. Delfino, who
            owns the remaining 69%, wants to build a residential
            subdivision on the property post partition. Delfino wants
            *partition by sale* probably because he does not want to put
            up a residential subdivision next to a busy commercial yard
            and has determined he will be able to buy Vealencis\'
            interest at auction.

            1.  Court explains that the policy is to **favor partition
                in kind** **unless both of the following are true**:

                a.  \(1\) partition in kind would be impracticable or
                    inequitable AND

                b.  \(2\) partition by sale would better serve both/all
                    of the parties\' interests.

            2.  The first requirement isn\'t satisfied.

                a.  Court determines that physical partition is
                    feasible---you can give ownership of one part to one
                    party and the other part to the other party.
                    Building the subdivision is still possible even with
                    garbage hauling business present. Thus, the first
                    requirement isn\'t satisfied.

            3.  The second requirement isn\'t satisfied.

                a.  Court determines that Delfino might lose market
                    value from having the garbage hauling business next
                    door; so, partition in kind isn\'t in their
                    interest. But, they\'re not the only party and you
                    must look at both parties\' interests; it\'s in
                    Vealencis\' best interests to do partition in kind:
                    she had possession for a long time and she lived on
                    the place (\"endowment effect\" -- people over time
                    get accustomed to property); her livelihood was
                    attached to the property. Thus, only one owner\'s
                    interest would be better served by partition in
                    sale, and both are necessary.

            4.  Court orders partition in kind. On remand, the trial
                court divided up the property in kind, giving Vealencis
                1 acre out of the 20.5 acres (the other 19.5 were
                unimproved) (curious decision) and also ordered her to
                pay an **owelty**:

                a.  **[Owelty]{.underline}**: **a payment to correct in
                    an imbalance arising from partitioning in kind**.

                b.  Lots can sometimes have physical characteristics
                    making partition in kind difficult to do neatly in a
                    way that corresponds to ownership interests (i.e.,
                    if a parcel has a ridge running through it, the
                    sensible way to divide the parcel might be to divide
                    right along the ridge; if the ridge ends up
                    splitting at 2/3 to 1/3 and the parties have 50/50
                    shares, the party receiving 2/3 would compensate the
                    other relative to the parcel\'s market value).

    c.  **Contribution and Accounting**:

        i.  Partition is not the only form of relief the cotenants can
            seek if there is a conflict between them. Under some
            circumstances, cotenants can receive a damages award (i.e.,
            money you get from your former cotenant.)

        ii. **Contribution**: if a cotenant unilaterally makes repairs
            or improvements to the property, the co-tenant who makes the
            improvements cannot demand contribution from the other
            tenant.

            1.  Exception 1: if co-tenant in possession acted with a
                good faith belief that he was the sole owner of the
                property.

                a.  It would be unfair to give the cotenant out of
                    possession a windfall by allowing him to have a part
                    ownership of an improvement wholly paid for by the
                    other cotenant (similar to \"mistaken improver\").

            2.  Exception 2: Estoppel -- if the cotenant who is out of
                possession knew the other tenant in possession was
                making changes but failed to object

            3.  Exception 3: the changes are repairs necessary to
                protect or preserve/protect the property (i.e., because
                it\'s necessary, both parties should share in the cost).

                a.  *Gilmore v. Gilmore* -- must be **necessary** and
                    **reasonable** (in expense).

        iii. **Accounting**: a cotenant may sue for his share of rents
             and profits from common property if he has been ousted from
             possession of the common property. **Ouster**: when a
             cotenant is excluded from possession.

             1.  ***Gilmore v. Gilmore*** (UT 1984) -- Tenancy in common
                 of some agricultural land. One tenant used the land for
                 grazing; if the other tenant also used the land for
                 grazing, the land would be overgrazed. So, the first
                 tenant kept the second tenant form using the land for
                 grazing. This is not allowed by the law of \"tenancy in
                 common\" because each cotenant in common has an equal
                 to possess the whole, which means that each cotenant
                 has a right to graze. The tenant being prevented from
                 grazing is going to have some opportunity for relief
                 here.

                 a.  **Accounting**: if a cotenant is ousted from
                     possession, the ousted cotenant can sue for his
                     share of the rents and profits from the common
                     property. This applies only if there is an ouster.
                     To show ouster:

                     i.  the mere fact that the other party used the
                         property isn\'t enough, even if this other
                         party is the only party to use the property.
                         Each party has a right to use the property so
                         long as he doesn\'t interfere with the other
                         party\'s equal right. So, there\'s ouster only
                         if the party in possession excludes the other
                         party or acts in a way that necessarily
                         excludes the other party.

                         1.  ℼ made unequivocal demand to ∆ in writing
                             that he intended to graze his cattle and
                             requested ∆\'s accommodation for the
                             grazing activities (i.e., told the ∆ not to
                             graze too much so my cattle can graze too).
                             Accommodation between the two was necessary
                             in order for the ℼ to also graze because
                             otherwise you\'d have overgrazing from
                             tragedy of the commons. But ∆ refused.

                         2.  Here **there was ouster** because there was
                             **(1)** a clear unequivocal demand combined
                             with **(2)** a refusal to accommodate the
                             cotenant\'s right to use.

                             a.  So, the court awards damages---an
                                 accounting in damages.

                 b.  **Contribution**: contributions can be required
                     among cotenants but not always. Ordinarily, if a
                     cotenant who possesses property unilaterally
                     decides to make improvements or repairs to the
                     property, the cotenant who makes these unilateral
                     improvements cannot demand that the other cotenant
                     help pay for them. The cotenant who made the
                     changes would be responsible for the entire cost of
                     the changes.

                     i.  Here, the ∆ was seeking a contribution for a
                         fence that he put up. The court says he can get
                         a contribution since the repairs were
                         **necessary** and the expense was
                         **reasonable**.

    d.  **Severance**: converts a *joint tenancy* into a *tenancy in
        common.* (contrast with: partition, which takes either a joint
        tenancy or a tenancy in common and converts them into separate
        ownership---separate \"fees\").

        i.  Either tenant can unilaterally sever a joint tenancy.

            1.  In common law you could do this by severing one of the
                four unities, by, for example, engaging in a straw
                transaction (i.e., go to lawyer\'s office, transfer your
                interest to secretary who immediately transfers back to
                you; voila, now the co-owners didn\'t receive ownership
                at the same time).

        ii. ***Harms v. Sprague*** (Ill. 1984) -- William and John Harms
            have a joint tenancy relationship (right of survivorship).
            John and William harms owned a property in a joint tenancy.
            John borrowed money via a mortgage on the property from
            Simmons; John\'s will left his share of the property to
            Sprague. John then died. If this is still a joint tenancy,
            then William ends up wit the property, John\'s interest
            vanishes, William\'s interest increases proportionately
            (Sprague would be out of luck). But if the mortgage to
            Simmons severed the joint tenancy, then John and William at
            that point owned simply as tenants in common---who don\'t
            have right of survivorship, meaning John\'s will would be
            effective and his interest would go to Sprague. Williams
            sues to quiet title and get a declaratory judgment that he
            owns the property. Sprague objects.

            1.  Does a mortgage by one joint tenant sever the joint
                tenancy?

                a.  No. Destroying one of the four unities would sever
                    the joint tenancy (i.e., if John had sold his
                    interest to Simmons---there would be just a tenancy
                    in common). But *unilateral mortgage does not sever
                    the joint tenancy* (so long as John kept making the
                    mortgage payments); there is no conveyance to
                    Simmons.

                    i.  Sprague loses out (since John\'s ownership went
                        to William).

            2.  Does the mortgage survive the mortgager\'s death as a
                lien (legal interest that a creditor has in someone\'s
                property, usually based on securing a debt)?

                a.  No. This was a lien on the giver\'s interest, on
                    John\'s interest. When John dies, his interest (the
                    interest securing the mortgage) vanished, and
                    William\'s interest, increased proportionately.

                    i.  Thus, Simmons loses out as well (Simmons might
                        be able to get the money but just can\'t get the
                        property now because it\'s no longer securing
                        the interest on the mortgage).

                    ii. If William had died, with John now having 100%
                        property interest, generally the rule is that
                        the mortgage would be secured only by John\'s
                        original interest in the property.

            3.  Rule: (1) unilateral mortgages do not sever the property
                and (2) mortgages related to one joint cotenant\'s
                interest do not survive as a lien on the property.

            4.  Prof. Lee: bad lawyering; Simmons should have had both
                cotenants sign off on mortgage and then it still would
                have been secured by the property interest.

            5.  A person can sever a joint tenancy into a tenancy in
                common without their joint cotenant knowing if they sell
                their interest to someone else, since severing any of
                the four unities will sever the joint tenancy, leaving a
                tenancy in common in its place (trust is important with
                joint tenancy).

                a.  Unilateral lease might sever a joint tenancy (varies
                    by state).

                b.  Murder severs a joint tenancy.

            6.  Difference between partition and severance: partition
                converts either a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common
                into separate deeds or money from sales; severance
                converts a joint tenancy into a tenancy in common.

**IV. Leases**

***A. Overview***

1.  Leases are another way (in addition to licenses and easements) of
    dividing up the bundle of rights of property.

2.  Leases transfer possession, meaning the lessee has a right to
    exclude (different from a license or an easement, which convey only
    rights to use).

    a.  If A, renting a property, throws a party and invites B, and then
        C tries to crash the party; A can exclude C since A has a lease
        and therefore a right to exclude; but B, who merely has a
        license (and right to use), cannot exclude C.

***B. 4 Types of Leases***

1.  **[Term of Year(s):]{.underline}** a lease that ends on a specified
    date (could be six months, one year, thirty years). Because a term
    of years lease ends automatically at a fixed time, neither party has
    to give notice to end it on that date, is simply ends.

2.  **[Periodic Tenancy]{.underline}**: roll over for a specified period
    of time, often month to month. Either party may terminate a periodic
    tenancy but termination usually requires advance notice, with the
    notification period being the same as the lease period (i.e., in a
    month-to-month lease, you\'d have to give 1-month notice before you
    left; relaxed for 1-year lease where you can now give a month\'s
    notice).

3.  **[Tenancy at will]{.underline}**: can be terminated by either party
    at any time for any reason. But many jurisdictions require advance
    notice determined by the payment period.

4.  **[Tenancy at sufferance]{.underline}**: \"overstaying;\" arises
    when there\'s a lease that ends and the tenant just doesn\'t leave.
    This person is different from a trespasser in that a trespasser
    didn\'t have permission to go on the property in the first place;
    the tenant at sufferance did have permission to go on property.
    Landlords have the right to evict tenants in sufferance but may not
    have the right to use self-help (i.e., *Burg v. Wiley*, tenancy in
    sufferance where landlord did not have the right to use self-help).

***C. Recurring theme in Lease cases:***

1.  The law sorting out how to allocate risk in situations where there
    are asymmetries in information and control between landlords and
    tenants.

***D. Independent Covenant Rule***

1.  **Rule**: If the covenants are independent and one party does not
    fulfill its covenant, that does not void the other covenants; if one
    party violates a covenant, this doesn\'t permit the other party to
    violate its covenant.

2.  ***Paradine v. Jane*** (Eng. 1647) -- Landlord leased agricultural
    land to a tenant for term of years at fixed rent. Because it\'s a
    term of years, the tenant cannot get out early. During civil war,
    Prince Rupert\'s army ousts tenant from possession so tenant stops
    paying rent. Landlord sues. Tenant argues he should not have to pay
    rent because he was ousted.

    a.  Court determines that ouster is irrelevant and tenant still has
        to pay rent.

    b.  Relationship between the covenants that the landlord and tenant
        gave each other when they entered into the lease agreement:

        i.  Two covenants created by the lease agreement:

            1.  Landlord gave a **covenant of quiet enjoyment**:
                landlord would not displace the tenant during the term
                of the lease. (Note: that this is about the **landlord
                not interfering with tenant\'s possession**, not that
                the landlord will prevent someone else from interfering
                with possession).

            2.  Tenant gave the covenant to pay rent.

        ii. These two covenants are **independent** of each other. Thus,
            failure to fulfill one covenant, doesn\'t exclude
            nonperformance of the other covenant.

        iii. Remedy for breach of covenant is to sue for the breach and
             try to get damages. Even though the tenant had stopped
             paying rent, the landlord could not just lease the property
             to someone else since this would violate the covenant of
             quiet enjoyment (i.e., the only remedy is damages since he
             can\'t stop the lease).

    c.  Risk allocation: should Prince Rupert\'s occupation count as
        ouster? No.

        i.  Tenant gets all the benefits from increased profits from the
            land if the land does well; the landlord would just get the
            fixed rent. Since this is true if tenant has super high
            profits, the same should be true if tenant has super low
            revenue. Tenant gets all the benefits from uncertainty about
            the value of the agricultural produce and thus should
            similarly bear the risk.

            1.  Tenant is still on the hook for the rent. Note: landlord
                could theoretically sue Prince Rupert for trespass to
                recoup the rent.

            2.  (i.e., Apple Store example)

            3.  Prof Lee: this makes sense since asymmetric control and
                information both favor the tenant. The tenant controls
                the operations---the success and failure of the ability
                to sell goods. In this case, note that the tenant is
                also better situated to monitor threats to the property
                (landlord could be 100s of miles away). Tenant, who has
                possession, is also better situated to fortify the
                property; the landlord isn\'t in possession and can\'t
                come on property to fortify.

            4.  Note: in U.S. today, if residence is destroyed, tenant
                doesn\'t have to pay. But commercial leases are closer
                to the common law rule.

***E. Dependent Covenant Model (modern law has moved towards dependent
covenants)***

1.  **Rule**: if the landlord does not fulfill the covenant of quiet
    enjoyment, then the tenant does not need to fulfill the covenant to
    pay rent.

2.  **Factors for Dependent Covenants**:

    a.  Structure of the lease

    b.  Plain language of the lease

    c.  Subject matter

3.  ***Smith v. Mcenany*** (MA 1897) -- Landlord leases some land to the
    tenant, there was a shed on the tenant\'s land. Landlord makes a
    minor encroachment on tenant\'s property by building a wall, some of
    which is on the tenant\'s property. The landlord built the wall
    knowing it encroached on the tenant\'s property. Tenant stops paying
    rent. Court holds for the tenant.

    a.  Court determines that while the encroachment is ongoing, the
        tenant is not required to pay rent at all for any of the
        property, not just for the part encroached upon.

        i.  Encroachment violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment and
            this covenant is not independent of the covenant to pay
            rent. **Covenant of quiet enjoyment** and **covenant to pay
            rent are** **dependent covenants**. Doesn\'t matter that the
            encroachment was small.

        ii. Note: incredibly large benefit for tenant that this minor
            encroachment means no rent.

    b.  The tenant is still obligated to repair the shed. The covenant
        to repair the shed is **independent of the landlord\'s covenant
        of quiet enjoyment**.

        i.  Prof notes this makes sense since only tenant has right to
            possess and landlord can\'t come onto the tenant\'s property
            to fix the shed; otherwise, the shed would deteriorate,
            which is socially wasteful (i.e., similar to permissive
            waste where an unreasonable failure to act causes excess
            damage). One party has a present possessory interest, the
            lessee, and another party who has a future reversionary
            interest, the landlord. If the tenant just lets the shed
            fall into disrepair, this is like permissive waste; thus, it
            makes sense to require paying the shed).

            1.  Difference b/t this case and Golden Press→ this was an
                intentional encroachment because landlord knew the wall
                was being built on tenant\'s property. Difference from
                Paradine → here, the landlord is doing the
                dispossessing, not Prince Rupert.

        ii. Prof notes that allowing the landlord to intentionally build
            across the property line and then just pay damages for
            market value of encroachment would effectively allow the
            landlord to change the lease unilaterally (even if tenant
            wouldn\'t have agreed to the deal).

    c.  Rule: when the covenants are dependent and the landlord breaches
        a covenant, then the tenant does not have to pay rent.

    d.  Policy (intentional torts):

        i.  Allocation of risk: no risk allocation issue here because
            landlord deliberately encroached.

        ii. Asymmetry of control: the landlord can control where he
            builds the wall and tenant cannot; thus, it makes sense for
            landlord to bear the cost.

4.  ***Medico-Dental Building Company v. Horton and Converse***
    (CA 1942) -- Lease for H&C to have a pharmacy in the building.
    Landlord agreed to a restrictive covenant that prohibits leasing to
    another drug seller in the building. The purpose is for H&C to have
    a monopoly on all patients who get prescriptions from doctors in the
    building. Landlord then leased to Dr. Boonshaft and allowed Dr. to
    sell drugs only to his own patients, but not to other people.
    Boonshaft\'s patients are exactly who H&C wanted to sell drugs to.
    At first, Boonshaft bought his drugs from H&C but then in order to
    avoid sales tax switched to a wholesaler. H&C stopped paying rent.

    a.  Court determines that **covenants are dependent** (meaning H&C
        was justified in not paying rent).

        i.  **Rule: to determine whether covenants are independent or
            dependent, look to the** **intent of the parties**. Here the
            court looks to three things:

            1.  **(1)** the covenant to pay rent and the covenant not to
                lease to other drug sellers are together in a rider,
                showing they were intended to be linked.

            2.  **(2)** if one reviews the plain language of the
                agreement, it is clear the covenants were intended to be
                linked.

            3.  **(3)** the protection of competition is a material part
                of consideration H&C received when agreeing to the lease
                price.

        ii. Thus, the covenants were linked and there was a
            **substantial breach** of a **dependent covenant**---the
            exclusive right to sell drugs was the essence of the
            agreement.

        iii. This suggests that if the breach had been minor, the court
             might have treated the covenant to pay rent as still
             binding; i.e., might have treated the covenants as
             **independent**.

    b.  Three remedies available:

        i.  Rescind the lease (chose this option: presumably damages
            weren\'t enough to pay for lawyers).

        ii. Stay with lease but for damages from lost profits resulting
            from the violation

        iii. Rescind the lease and sue for damages suffered between time
             of breach and the time they rescinded.

    c.  Rule: major breaches in lease agreements, tend to be treated as
        breaches of dependent covenants; minor breaches tend to be
        treated as breaches of independent covenants (in this case the
        remedy would be limited to damages).

***F. Doctrine of Caveat Leasee (tenant beware)***

1.  **Rule**: even if the property is unsuitable for the tenant\'s
    purposes, tenant still has to pay rent. This is the default but can
    be changed by contract (buyer beware). **No implied warranties of
    fitness unless the landlord committed fraud or the parties
    negotiated expressly to create a warranty of fitness**.

2.  ***Sutton v. Temple*** (Eng. 1843) -- Neither landlord (if landlord
    had known, this would be fraud) nor tenant knew grass had been
    poisoned by paint. Cows were eating the grass and producing poisoned
    milk. The lease had no explicit warranties in it; question is
    whether tenant still needs to pay rent.

    a.  Court says: Caveat lessee -- lessee beware (default rule that
        can be changed by contract). Even if the property is unsuitable,
        the tenant still must pay rent. No explicit warranty in the
        lease no implied warranty of fitness. Tenant bears the risk that
        the property will not be suitable for what he intended to do
        with it.

    b.  Asymmetries of information and control: tenant can better assess
        what\'s best for the tenant. Much easier for tenant to know what
        he\'s looking for; harder for landlord to know what tenant
        needs.

        i.  On the other hand, would have been much easier for the
            landlord to monitor what the previous tenant was doing
            (i.e., poisoning the grass); landlord could have placed a
            provision in previous tenant\'s lease prohibiting pollution,
            meaning landlord could then have recovered from previous
            tenant if grass was poisoned (the new tenant lacks this sort
            of control).

            1.  Court have taken steps to mitigate caveat lessee,
                including the doctrines of constructive eviction and
                surrender and duty to mitigate.

3.  **Three doctrines that mitigate caveat lessee**:

    a.  **Constructive Eviction**: A tenant has a claim for constructive
        eviction when **(1)** a third party\'s conduct substantially
        interferes with tenant\'s use and enjoyment of lease\'s property
        and **(2)** landlord can be held responsible for this third
        party\'s conduct.

        i.  ***Blackett v. Olanoff*** (MA 1977) -- Landlord owned two
            properties near each other and rented them to two tenants.
            One tenant is a resident; another is a disco club. Resident
            complains of loud music. Undisputed that noise substantially
            interfered with use and enjoyment. Resident-tenant left;
            claims constructive eviction, meaning he wouldn\'t have to
            pay rent for the remaining term of the lease.

            1.  Element **(1)** of constructive eviction is clearly
                satisfied since noise substantially interfered.

            2.  Element **(2)** of constructive eviction is also
                satisfied because of the following were true:

                a.  Noise was the natural and probable consequence of
                    allowing a club to rent there AND

                b.  Landlord could control the tenant\'s music level by
                    including a clause in the club\'s lease and by
                    telling the club to keep it down.

                c.  Thus, the landlord had more control over whether the
                    other tenant, the club, is likely to create a
                    nuisance.

                d.  Prof. notes risk of violence if resident-tenant was
                    responsible.

        ii. **Constructive eviction allows the tenant-resident to get
            out of the lease** (tenant bears risk but not this risk
            specifically).

            1.  Note: for constructive eviction, tenant needs to leave
                the property in reasonable time; you can\'t claim
                constructive eviction and then stay on the property.

    b.  **Doctrine of Surrender**: Acceptance of tenant\'s
        repudiation/surrender can occur by: (1) express agreement or (2)
        implied acceptance. Acceptance is implied if landlord has done
        something so inconsistent with the landlord-tenant relationship
        that he manifests an intent to accept tenant\'s
        repudiation/surrender.

        i.  **Landlord has 3 options when a tenant attempts to repudiate
            a lease before its expiration:**

            1.  Reject repudiation and do nothing: landlord can sue for
                accrued rent (may be qualified by duty to mitigate)
                (landlord might not choose this option if tenant is
                judgment proof or if market for property has improved).

            2.  Reject the repudiation, enter the premises, and re-let
                for the tenant\'s benefit. Landlord re-lets as the agent
                of the tenant for the tenant\'s benefit: if the landlord
                chooses this option, the tenant is still required to pay
                rent until the landlord finds a new sub-letter. If the
                landlord sublets for a lower price, tenant has to pay
                the difference. Tenant still owes contract rate but
                it\'s diminished by whatever new tenant will pay.

            3.  Re-enter and re-let for landlord\'s benefit. Accept the
                repudiation and re-let to new tenant for the landlord\'s
                benefit: tenant no longer owes rent. This is an
                attractive option if market rates have gone up since the
                lease was entered into.

        ii. ***Gottlieb v. Taco Bell*** (NY 1994) -- Gottlieb leased
            property to TB on Aug. 15, 1991. TB pledged to exercise
            diligence in getting gov\'t approval to open at this
            location but was permitted to cancel the lease if unable to
            get gov\'t approval within a 6-month permitting period
            (i.e., if TB couldn\'t get approval by Feb. 15, 1992, TB
            could get out of the lease). Within a month of entering the
            lease, a community campaign began (\"safety and
            environmental concerns\") to keep TB out of the location. On
            Feb. 14^th^, the day before end of permitting period, TB
            serves Gottlieb with document purporting to repudiate the
            lease. Gottlieb rejects the repudiations. On June 15, 1992,
            first rent payment was due and TB didn\'t pay. Gottlieb sued
            TB.

            1.  Here, there was no express agreement since Gottlieb
                explicitly rejected the repudiation by letter.

            2.  Court says there was an acceptance of the repudiation by
                operation of law (i.e., implied acceptance) because the
                landlord acted so inconsistently with landlord-tenant
                relationship that he must have intended to end the
                relationship (therefore, the tenant was not liable to
                pay rent for any period after the acceptance of
                surrender had occurred).

                a.  Classic example is landlord receiving a letter of
                    repudiation and then changing the locks, thus
                    excluding tenant from possession. Even if landlord
                    hasn\'t explicitly accepted the repudiation, it has
                    implicitly accepted. Even if the landlord says he
                    rejects the repudiation, if he then changes the
                    locks, he\'s implicitly accepted.

                b.  This can apply even if there was an outward refusal
                    to accept repudiation by the landlord as there was
                    here. Gottlieb negotiated and made a written offer
                    to lease the premises to Rite Aid. While merely
                    attempting to re-let would not be enough for
                    implicit acceptance, this was beyond an attempt
                    since he negotiated and wrote the offer.

            3.  **Rule**: for acceptance of repudiation to be implied,
                actions must go beyond mere attempts to re-let but do
                not need to rise to level of actually leasing property
                to another tenant.

                a.  Gottlieb deemed to have accepted surrender by Nov.
                    1993.

            4.  How much rent does TB owe Gottlieb?

                a.  TB is liable for all the rent between the time that
                    rent started being due until the surrender was
                    accepted: from June 1992 until Nov. 1993.

    c.  **Duty to Mitigate**: Landlord must make reasonable efforts to
        re-let the property and the landlord has the duty to prove he
        exercised reasonable diligence in doing so. Tenant has to pay
        reasonable cost of re-letting.

        i.  ***Sommer v. Kriedel*** (NJ 1977) -- Kriedel signed a
            two-year lease (paying first month\'s rent and security
            deposit) and was planning on getting married with the
            couple\'s parents paying the rent but the wedding was called
            off. He also says he was recently discharged from the army
            and is a student. He tells the landlord via letter about all
            of this and says he can\'t pay anymore. Landlord does not
            re-let the apartment until 16 months after receiving the
            letter. Landlord sues seeking 16 months rent.

            1.  Court determines that landlord had a **duty to
                mitigate** damage and could have leased the property
                earlier (overturning NJ common law rule that tenant
                doing so would infringe on tenant\'s right to
                possession). **No viable distinction between a lease and
                an ordinary contract.** Therefore, we should just treat
                the lease as an ordinary contract with a duty to
                mitigate losses.

                a.  Landlord must take reasonable efforts to lease the
                    property to someone else and bears the burden of
                    showing he exercised reasonable diligence in doing
                    that.

                b.  However, the tenant is obligated to pay any
                    reasonable costs of re-letting (i.e., if landlord
                    put out ads for the apartment, former tenant would
                    pay costs).

            2.  In a majority of US jurisdictions, landlords have an
                implied duty to mitigate for residential property; for
                commercial leases, there is generally no duty to
                mitigate.

                a.  Thus, a business that bails out will be on the hook
                    for the entire rent unless the business surrenders
                    and the surrender has been accepted.

                    i.  Regardless, landlords have an inherent incentive
                        to mitigate damages anyway since tenants might
                        be judgment proof; even if not judgment proof,
                        going to court takes time and money.

            3.  Generally, the tenant can plead both surrender and duty
                to mitigate; thus, even if the court holds that the
                tenant didn\'t successfully surrender the lease and is
                still bound by it, the landlord might still have a duty
                to mitigate, which would then limit the tenant\'s
                damages.

        ii. Whether there is a surrender or duty to mitigate may make a
            financial difference to the tenant:

            1.  **Lease Termination Exercise**: Lease is term of years
                at \$1,000/month. Tenant vacates with 6-months
                remaining; writes letter indicating he can no longer pay
                rent and is leaving. Landlord relets the property at
                \$700/month after month 3. Given these facts, what does
                the tenant owe the landlord?

                a.  First part: determine what\'s owed for months 4, 5,
                    and 6, after landlord relet the property.

                    i.  **Court deems reletting here to be acceptance of
                        tenant\'s surrender and thus the landlord was
                        leasing on the landlord\'s own behalf.** How
                        much does tenant owe for remaining three months?

                        1.  Answer: tenant is now off the hook b/c
                            landlord accepted surrender; thus, tenant
                            **owed** **nothing** for months 4,5, and 6.

                    ii. Court determines that landlord\'s reletting was
                        not an acceptance of surrender, but instead
                        **landlord was reletting the property on the
                        tenant\'s behalf**. How much does tenant owe for
                        remaining three months?

                        1.  Answer: \$900. The tenant on the hook for
                            \$1,000/month. But since the new tenant is
                            paying \$700, tenant owes \$300/month x 3 =
                            \$900.

                b.  Second part: determine what\'s owed for months 1,2,
                    and 3, before landlord relet the property.

                    i.  In this jurisdiction, **there is no duty to
                        mitigate** (minority rule). How much does tenant
                        owe for first three months?

                        1.  Answer: \$3,000. No duty to mitigate. No
                            other money is coming in. \$1,000/month x 3
                            months = \$3,000.

                    ii. In this jurisdiction, **there is a** **duty to
                        mitigate**. In this situation, we need to know
                        what the reasonable amount of time would be for
                        the landlord to find a new tenant. Suppose the
                        court determines 1 month would be a reasonable
                        amount of time. How much does tenant owe for the
                        first three months?

                        1.  Answer: \$1,600. First month, \$1,000 (no
                            duty to mitigate) + second month, \$300
                            (duty to mitigate, can get \$700) + third
                            month, \$300 (duty to mitigate, can get
                            \$700).

                c.  Combing first and second parts, the total amount
                    owed depends on what the court holds with respect to
                    both of those time periods. The possible range of
                    values is \$1,600 - \$3,900 total.

**V. Implied Warranty of Habitability**

***A. Rule***

1.  Landlord of [residential property]{.underline} has a duty to make
    repairs as part of the **implied warranty of habitability** (exists
    in most states and cannot be waived or contracted around)

    a.  Does not show up in context of commercial leases.

***B. Old Rule***

1.  Tenant is responsible for making repairs to leased property because
    the lease gives tenant the right to possess so landlord has no right
    to go on property.

***C. Case that Invents the Implied Warranty of Habitability***

1.  ***Javins v. First National*** (D.C. 1970) -- At an apartment
    complex called Clifton Terrace, the tenants stopped paying rent,
    alleging multiple violations of the housing code. There was no
    allegation that the premises were in bad shape when originally
    rented; all that\'s alleged is landlord won\'t repair them (even
    though premises were likely in terrible shape from the start, if
    this had been alleged then the court wouldn\'t have ruled on implied
    warranty of habitability since there would\'ve been an illegal
    lease).

    a.  Court determines that old rule should be abandoned and that the
        **housing codes created an implied warranty of habitability. The
        covenant to pay rent is now dependent on the landlord\'s implied
        covenant of habitability, which is not waivable (note if
        there\'s a partial breach, the tenant may only get a discount on
        the rent)**. **Leases of urban dwelling units should be treated
        like any other contract.**

    b.  Four arguments why the landlord should pay for repairs:

        i.  \(1\) *Traditional rule no longer makes sense* (prof thinks
            only third sub-reason is strong):

            1.  today\'s city dweller is incompetent when it comes to
                making repairs (also for landlord);

            2.  modern accommodations are more complex today than they
                used to be (landlord too);

            3.  today\'s tenant frequently moves---if repairs last for
                10 years and then tenant moves out after two years, then
                tenant paid far beyond the benefit they received.

        ii. \(2\) *Landlord*-*tenant law should be consistent with
            consumer protection law*

        iii. \(3\) *Unequal bargaining power*:

             1.  landlords are benefiting from unequal bargaining power;
                 thus, it makes sense to impose on them the burden of
                 repairing

                 a.  use of standardized leases (prof. says real issue
                     isn\'t standardization since you don\'t want to
                     negotiate on everything anyway; rather, the concern
                     is when there\'s only one set of terms available
                     from every landlord---no meaningful consumer
                     choice);

                 b.  race and class discriminations (prof. notes that if
                     there\'s a constrained supply of housing for people
                     in these groups, why isn\'t the solution to
                     increase supply of housing? Why is the solution
                     imposing an un-waivable apartment quality
                     requirement?);

        iv. \(4\) *Poor housing quality hurts the entire city*

            1.  i.e., mentioned in Kingsbury

            2.  Prof. mentions, if this is the problem---that the whole
                city is afftected; why should the entire cost of
                providing the social benefit of better housing fall
                entirely on landlords?

    c.  Prof. Lee: IWH is not frequently enforced. If there is a breach
        of IWH, rich people will repair it themselves or just move. So,
        it\'s usually poorer people whose rents are low that need IWH;
        but these people will need to pay an attorney; many attorneys
        won\'t take the case since there\'s little money in it.

**[Takings]{.underline}**

**I. Eminent Domain**

***A. Overview***

1.  The power of eminent domain gives the gov\'t the authority to take
    private property (without consent) for **public use** in exchange
    for **just compensation**. It is a federal or state government\'s
    power that can be delegated to lower tier entities, like cities or
    towns.

    a.  It can also be delegated to some businesses, traditionally,
        utility companies and railroads. Some states, as we discussed,
        also delegate the power to individuals to create easements to
        avoid landlocked property.

2.  Eminent domain is **limited** by both the Constitution (5^th^ and
    14^th^ Am. DPC; 5^th^ Am. TC) and statutes---the Constitution
    prescribes minimum requirements but state constitutions and statutes
    can create stricter limits on takings.

    a.  5^th^ Am. Takings Clause: \"Nor shall private property be taken
        for public use without just compensation.\"

3.  Eminent Domain proceedings are known as \"condemnation
    proceedings.\" The person who owns the property being taken is the
    \"condemnee.\"

4.  \"Implied attribute of sovereignty\" -- a power that a government
    must have merely by virtue of being a government.

    a.  Prof. notes difficulty of justifying a power that allows
        government to coerce people who did nothing wrong; this coercion
        doesn\'t fit with the other justifications we have for allowing
        gov\'t to coerce (i.e., because a person did something wrong and
        now must go to jail).

    b.  The standard justification today is economic: property markets
        are \"thin\" markets---there are few sellers of real property at
        any given time; and properties are unique, meaning it\'s not
        possible to just substitute another piece of property for the
        one you want.

        i.  This creates **holdout problems**: if a project requires
            acquiring a large amount of property and there is no power
            of eminent domain; then holdout problems could easily derail
            the project.

            1.  \"strategic holdouts\" -- people realizing they have the
                project creators over a barrel

            2.  \"stubborn holdouts\" -- people w/high personal value in
                property and don\'t want to sell.

        ii. Because holdout problems can hurt the public interest; it\'s
            isn\'t optimal to simply assume that if the government wants
            land, it can buy it.

            1.  It is not efficient to give this property owner
                **property rule protection**, since it would mean that
                the entitlement will only change hands at the price
                agreed to by the property owner.

        iii. The law uses the other Calabresi and Melamed category: the
             owner still has the entitlement but only protected by
             **liability rule protection**. Thus, it can change hands at
             a price determined by some external entity, in this case,
             the market value.

***B. Two requirements**: taking must be for **public use**; and **just
compensation** must be paid.*

1.  **[Just Compensation Requirement]{.underline}**:

    a.  ***United States v Miller*** (1943) -- Supreme Court determined
        that \"just compensation\" means the property\'s fair market
        value---what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in cash
        even if this value differs from what the owner himself would
        have placed on the property.

2.  **[Public Use Requirement]{.underline}**:

    a.  Interpretations

        i.  Early interpretation (mid-19^th^ to early 20^th^ century):
            was \"use by the public.\"

            1.  i.e., limited to highways, railroads, parks, etc.

        ii. Later interpretation: expanded to anything that serves some
            public purpose

            1.  The court gives great deference to state legislatures to
                determine if there is a public benefit.

            2.  This later interpretation has been criticized in recent
                years---pushback on whether public benefit is enough to
                fulfill the public use requirement.

    b.  ***Kelo v. City of New London*** (2005) -- City formulated an
        urban redevelopment plan to create jobs, increase tax revenues,
        attract new businesses and create recreational opportunities
        after Pfizer announced building an HQ nearby. City negotiated
        purchases for many lots buy some owners refused to sell so the
        City attempted to exercise eminent domain. Two people hold-out
        and will not sell their waterfront property; challenged the
        condemnation as an unconstitutional taking on the grounds that
        the project for which the property was being taken did not
        constitute a public use.

        i.  Issue: is a \"public use\" use by the public or could merely
            producing some public benefit be enough?

        ii. **Court determines that the taking is permissible as long as
            there\'s some public purpose, but it must be a genuine
            public purpose, can\'t simply be pretextual**.

            1.  Policy reasons

                a.  \"use by the public\"-test (old test) is difficult
                    to administer (i.e., how much access by the public
                    is enough; public school, for example, isn\'t used
                    by the entire public?)

                b.  \"use by the public\"-test is constrained, which is
                    impractical for a modern age.

            2.  Doctrinal justifications

                a.  Previous cases have upheld the constitutionality of
                    takings for a wide range of public purposes.

                    i.  ***Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff*** (1984)
                        -- Case where gov\'t tried to alleviate negative
                        effects of a land oligopoly and transferred
                        private property from one private individual to
                        another. Court held that immediate transfer of
                        property from one private individual to another
                        satisfies the public use requirement in this
                        case (\"eliminating the social and economic
                        evils of a land oligopoly\").

                    ii. ***Berkman v. Parker*** (1954) -- case where
                        blighted area was going to be condemned for use
                        of schools. Gov\'t can decide nation\'s capital
                        should be \"beautiful and sanitary.\" Court held
                        that community redevelopment program being
                        spearheaded by a private development company
                        satisfied the public use requirement (i.e.,
                        *Javins*---low quality housing hurts the entire
                        city).

        iii. **Taking private property for economic redevelopment by
             private organizations is a valid public use**, and there\'s
             no principled way to distinguish it from other public
             purposes---one may better serve a public end through a
             private enterprise. But merely generating tax revenue might
             be insufficient. **Federalism argument**: great deference
             should be given to states in determining public needs; here
             the deference is warranted since the city made a careful
             plan and the city was not taking the land simply to benefit
             the private companies.

        iv. **Dissent** (O\'Connor): under this holding, any property is
            vulnerable to a taking because most properties can be put to
            a better use (slippery slope). There is also a risk of
            racial bias. Also argues that economic development takings
            are not a public use. In *Berman* and *Midkiff*, the
            property taken caused a public harm, but in this case, there
            is no claim that the two owners\' well-maintained homes are
            the source of any social harm.

            1.  Prof. Lee notes that an alternative to planned housing,
                often resulting from use of eminent domain, is housing
                vouchers.

        v.  Considered an overall bad decision in the eyes of the
            public; led to states amending their constitutions.

**II. Regulatory Takings**

***A. Overview***

1.  Conflicts arise when the government does something claiming that
    it\'s acting under the police power but the affected citizens claim
    the government should have been acting under its power of eminent
    domain. The government is allowed to do the act either way; but if
    the government\'s acting under its eminent domain power, it has to
    pay just compensation whereas if it\'s acting under its police power
    it does not have to pay compensation.

    a.  if the government is addressing a public nuisance b/c there\'s a
        huge garbage heap on your property starting to breed vermin,
        this is a public nuisance and the gov\'t can require you to
        clean it up and does not have to pay you.

    b.  but if the government wants to take your lot and turn it into a
        public garden, then it has to pay you.

2.  In these cases, the property owned is suing to have the property
    condemned.

    a.  I own Blackacre. You, the gov\'t, want Blackacre. So, you
        condemn Blackacre and take it away from me.

    b.  With regulatory takings, I own Blackacre and you, the gov\'t,
        place some restrictions on what I can do with Blackacre, and I
        sue you, the gov\'t, saying you should have taken my property
        through eminent domain so that I would then get just
        compensation.

***B. Political views***

1.  Right → compensating those who are harmed by regulations: if gov\'t
    has to pay for the cost of regulations, it will be forced to make
    less invasive regulations.

2.  Left → government should not be burdened by more frequently paying
    for regulations.

***C. Two basic ways court can decide if some government action counts
as a regulatory taking***

1.  **[Per se takings]{.underline}**: categorical takings; regulations
    that always constitute a taking

    a.  ***Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.*** (1982) -- a
        government action will be a taking if it does both of the
        following two things:

        i.  **(1)** Government authorization of

        ii. **(2)** a permanent physical occupation.

        iii. Statute prohibiting landlords from preventing cable wires
             from running through buildings qualified as a regulatory
             taking.

    b.  ***Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council*** (1992) -- a
        government action is a taking if:

        i.  **(1)** it eliminates **[all]{.underline}** (not just
            99.99%) economically beneficial use of the land and

        ii. **(2)** in so doing doesn\'t simply mirror the result that
            state nuisance law would have produced.

        iii. ***Murr v. Wisconsin*** (2017) -- may have changed how one
             calculates 100% wipeout in *Lucas*.

2.  **[Ad Hoc takings]{.underline}**: case-by-case approach

    a.  Government regulations that are less drastic but might
        constitute regulatory takings.

    b.  ***Pennsylvania Coal Company v Mahon*** (1922) -- Landowner
        granted Coal company the right t mine coal underneath the land
        (ad coelum) and the contract allowed the company to mine out as
        much coal as it wants---even if it causes the land to collapse
        (i.e., surface subsidence). PA passed a law prohibiting surface
        subsidence of surface property that has a residence. This law
        conflicts with the agreement b/t landowner and company.

        i.  Court determines that yes this was a regulatory taking for
            constitutional purposes.

            1.  Whether a regulation constitutes a taking is a matter of
                degree: while property may be regulated to a certain
                extent, if the regulation goes too far then it
                constitutes a taking. Whether it \"goes too far\"
                depends on each case.

        ii. **Four Factors to consider if the regulation \"goes too
            far.\"**

            1.  [How large is the diminution in value caused by the
                regulation?]{.underline}

                a.  Holmes majority: In this case, PA law took the
                    entire waiver away from the coal company. Reduced to
                    zero the value of the company\'s right to use
                    supports since now the company cannot mine coal.

                    i.  The company had invested in pillars needed in
                        order to keep the ground from collapsing so that
                        it could continue mining; now this investment
                        was completely worthless.

                b.  Brandeis dissent: points out that just one stick in
                    the bundle was taken away; this means every
                    regulation that says you no longer have a right to
                    do x qualifies as a regulatory taking.

            2.  [Is the activity being regulated a public
                nuisance?]{.underline}

                a.  It it\'s just preventing a harm to the general
                    public; the state is allowed to do this under the
                    police power and it is not a taking and the gov\'t
                    doesn\'t owe compensation.

                    i.  Not the case here: could easily protect public
                        safety by requiring coal companies to provide
                        notice to residents before they remove the coal
                        that is holding up the surface.

            3.  [Was there average reciprocity of
                advantage?]{.underline}

                a.  Does this regulation, in placing a burden on the
                    plaintiff, also provide a benefit to the plaintiff
                    by requiring everyone else to comply with it as
                    well? And is the benefit roughly equal to the
                    burden? If so, then not a taking.

                    i.  Not the case here: burdens all fell on coal
                        company---the subsurface owner---whereas
                        benefits all fell with homeowner, the above
                        surface owner.

                    ii. Brandeis thinks this only applies if regulation
                        provides a benefit not if it prevents a harm

            4.  [The regulation destroyed existing property and contract
                rights]{.underline}

                a.  Holmes majority thinks this is an important factor

                    i.  This happens here so it\'s a taking.

                b.  Brandeis dissent thinks this is irrelevant

                    i.  Concerned contracts would then be used to get
                        compensation.

    c.  ***Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City*** (1978) --
        Railroad needs money and wants to build a 55-story high rise on
        top of Grant Central, a landmark property. NY law required
        government approval for alternation to landmark properties but
        also provides compensation in the form of transferrable
        development rights (TDR). Landmarks commission denied request to
        build on top of Grand Central.

        i.  TDRs are rights landmark owners are granted reflecting the
            difference between what zoning law would allow the owner to
            do with the landmark property and what landmark preservation
            law allows the owner to do with the landmark property

            1.  i.e., if zoning would allow you to build a building that
                is 50 stories tall but landmark law restricts you to 2
                stories, then you have 48 stories worth of development
                rights that you can\'t use but that can be sold to a
                neighbor, a property next door; if this neighbor was
                only allowed 50 stories, he could purchase these rights
                and be allowed 98 stories.

        ii. Court determines this was not a regulatory taking (uses a
            different list of factors than *Mahon*):

            1.  **Regulatory taking analysis**:

                a.  [Extent of diminution of value caused by the
                    regulation]{.underline} → look at whole parcel, not
                    just the air rights (follows Brandeis\' dissent).

                b.  [Whether regulation interfered with \"distinct
                    investment-backed expectation\"]{.underline} → did
                    the property owner spend money in expectation that
                    he would be able to do something?

                    i.  In this case, the primary expectation was to use
                        Grand Central for trains, not an office
                        building; so, no interference with
                        investment-backed expectation.

                    ii. Penn Central still could get a reasonable rate
                        of return through TDRS.

                c.  [Character of government action]{.underline} →
                    physical invasion? Or does regulation merely adjust
                    burdens and benefits of economic life to promote the
                    common good/living in society?

                    i.  Here, not invading. This is more like zoning, a
                        general regulation for the common good.

            2.  Dissent (Rehnquist): we should use the *Mahon* factors,
                which suggest this is a regulatory taking.

        iii. There is no fixed list of factors, depends on jurisdiction.

        iv. Professor notes the backdrop of this case---NYC is bankrupt
            and everyone wants to keep Grand Central---meant that if
            this was declared a taking, NYC couldn\'t afford to pay Penn
            Central the money to keep the regulation in place, which
            would mean the Grand Central would be demolished or have
            aesthetically displeasing 50-story addition.
