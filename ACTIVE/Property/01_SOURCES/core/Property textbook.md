## CHAPTER I

# WHAT IS PROPERTY?

### A. TWO CONCEPTIONS OF PROPERTY

What is property? There is a surprisingly wide range of
answers to this basic question. We start with two conceptions of property. One
may

be familiar to you already: property as a right to a thing
good against the world. In contrast to this traditional everyday view, many
theorists adopt

a competing conception of property as a collection
(“bundle”) of rights, with content that varies according to context and policy
choices. As a

way into these conceptions and the study of property law, we
present in this Chapter a series of cases about interferences with legal
interests in

land. The cases introduce some basic legal concepts
important to the study of property, including trespass and nuisance, the use of
contracts to

resolve property disputes, and the conditions for granting
injunctions rather than awarding damages for violations of property rights. We
also use

the cases to raise more fundamental issues about the nature
of property.

### 1 .TRESPASS TO LAND

#### Jacque v. Steenberg Homes, Inc.

```



Supreme Court of Wisconsin, 1997.



563 N.W. 2 d 154.



```

■
WILLIAM A. BABLITCH, JUSTICE. Steenberg Homes had a mobile home to deliver.
Unfortunately for Harvey and Lois Jacque (the Jacques), the

easiest route of delivery was across their land. Despite
adamant protests by the Jacques, Steenberg plowed a path through the Jacques’
snow-

covered field and via that path, delivered the mobile home.
Consequently, the Jacques sued Steenberg Homes for intentional trespass. At
trial,

Steenberg Homes conceded the intentional trespass, but
argued that no compensatory damages had been proved, and that punitive damages
could

not be awarded without compensatory damages. Although the
jury awarded the Jacques $1 in nominal damages and $100,000 in punitive

damages, the circuit court set aside the jury’s award of
$100,000. The court of appeals affirmed, reluctantly concluding that it could
not reinstate

the punitive damages because it was bound by precedent
establishing that an award of nominal damages will not sustain a punitive
damage

award. * * *

I.

The relevant facts follow. Plaintiffs, Lois and Harvey
Jacques, are an elderly couple, now retired from farming, who own roughly 170
acres

near Wilke’s Lake in the town of Schleswig. The defendant,
Steenberg Homes, Inc. (Steenberg), is in the business of selling mobile homes.
In

#2

the fall of 1993, a neighbor of the Jacques purchased a
mobile home from Steenberg. Delivery of the mobile home was included in the
sales

price.

Steenberg determined that the easiest route to deliver the
mobile home was across the Jacques’ land. Steenberg preferred transporting the

home across the Jacques’ land because the only alternative
was a private road which was covered in up to seven feet of snow and contained
a

sharp curve which would require sets of “rollers” to be used
when maneuvering the home around the curve. Steenberg asked the Jacques on

several separate occasions whether it could move the home
across the Jacques’ farm field. The Jacques refused. The Jacques were sensitive
about

allowing others on their land because they had lost property
valued at over $10,000 to other neighbors in an adverse possession action in
the mid-

1980’s. Despite repeated refusals from the Jacques,
Steenberg decided to sell the mobile home, which was to be used as a summer
cottage, and

delivered it on February 15, 1994.

On the morning of delivery, Mr. Jacque observed the mobile
home parked on the corner of the town road adjacent to his property. He

decided to find out where the movers planned to take the
home. The movers, who were Steenberg employees, showed Mr. Jacque the path they

planned to take with the mobile home to reach the neighbor’s
lot. The path cut across the Jacques’ land. Mr. Jacque informed the movers that
it

was the Jacques’ land they were planning to cross and that
Steenberg did not have permission to cross their land. He told them that
Steenberg had

been refused permission to cross the Jacques’ land.

One of Steenberg’s employees called the assistant manager,
who then came out to the Jacques’ home. In the meantime, the Jacques called

and asked some of their neighbors and the town chairman to
come over immediately. Once everyone was present, the Jacques showed the

assistant manager an aerial map and plat book of the
township to prove their ownership of the land, and reiterated their demand that
the home not

be moved across their land.

At that point, the assistant manager asked Mr. Jacque how
much money it would take to get permission. Mr. Jacque responded that it was

not a question of money; the Jacques just did not want
Steenberg to cross their land. Mr. Jacque testified that he told Steenberg to
“[F]ollow the

road, that is what the road is for.” Steenberg employees
left the meeting without permission to cross the land.

At trial, one of Steenberg’s employees testified that, upon
coming out of the Jacques’ home, the assistant manager stated: “I don’t give a
–––

what [Mr. Jacque] said, just get the home in there any way
you can.” The other Steenberg employee confirmed this testimony and further

testified that the assistant manager told him to park the
company truck in such a way that no one could get down the town road to see the
route

the employees were taking with the home. The assistant
manager denied giving these instructions, and Steenberg argued that the road
was

blocked for safety reasons.

#3

The employees, after beginning down the private road,
ultimately used a “bobcat” to cut a path through the Jacques’ snow-covered
field and

hauled the home across the Jacques’ land to the neighbor’s
lot. One employee testified that upon returning to the office and informing the

assistant manager that they had gone across the field, the
assistant manager reacted by giggling and laughing. The other employee
confirmed this

testimony. The assistant manager disputed this testimony.

When a neighbor informed the Jacques that Steenberg had, in
fact, moved the mobile home across the Jacques’ land, Mr. Jacque called the

Manitowoc County Sheriff’s Department. After interviewing
the parties and observing the scene, an officer from the sheriff’s department
issued

a $30 citation to Steenberg’s assistant manager. * * *

This case presents three issues: (1) whether an award of
nominal damages for intentional trespass to land may support a punitive damage

award and, if so; (2) whether the law should apply to
Steenberg or should only be applied prospectively and, if we apply the law to
Steenberg; (3)

whether the $100,000 in punitive damages awarded by the jury
is excessive. * * *

II.

* * * Steenberg argues that, as a matter of law, punitive
      damages could not be awarded by the jury because punitive damages must be

supported by an award of compensatory damages and here the
jury

#4

awarded only nominal and punitive damages. The Jacques
contend that the rationale supporting the compensatory damage award requirement
is

inapposite when the wrongful act is an intentional trespass
to land. We agree with the Jacques. * * *

The general rule was stated in Barnard v. Cohen , 162 N.W.
480 (Wis. 1917), where the question presented was: “In an action for libel, can

there be a recovery of punitory damages if only nominal
compensatory damages are found?” With the bare assertion that authority and
better

reason supported its conclusion, the Barnard court said no.
Barnard continues to state the general rule of punitive damages in Wisconsin.
The

rationale for the compensatory damage requirement is that if
the individual cannot show actual harm, he or she has but a nominal interest,
hence,

society has little interest in having the unlawful, but
otherwise harmless, conduct deterred, therefore, punitive damages are
inappropriate. Jacque

v. Steenberg Homes, Inc., 548 N.W.2d 80 (Wis. Ct. App.
1996); Maxwell v. Kennedy, 7 N.W. 657, 658–59 (Wis. 1880).

However, whether nominal damages can support a punitive
damage award in the case of an intentional trespass to land has never been

squarely addressed by this court. Nonetheless, Wisconsin law
is not without reference to this situation. In 1854 the court established
punitive

damages, allowing the assessment of “damages as a punishment
to the defendant for the purpose of making an example.” McWilliams v. Bragg,

3 Wis. 424, 425 (1854).^3 The McWilliams court related the
facts and an illustrative tale from the English case of Merest v. Harvey, 128
Eng. Rep.

761 (C.P. 1814), to explain the rationale underlying
punitive damages.

In Merest, a landowner was shooting birds in his field when
he was approached by the local magistrate who wanted to hunt with him.

Although the landowner refused, the magistrate proceeded to
hunt. When the landowner continued to object, the magistrate threatened to have

him jailed and dared him to file suit. Although little
actual harm had been caused, the English court upheld damages of 500 pounds,
explaining

“in a case where a man disregards every principle which
actuates the conduct of gentlemen, what is to restrain him except large
damages?”

McWilliams, 3 Wis. 424 at 428.

To explain the need for punitive damages, even where actual
harm is slight, McWilliams related the hypothetical tale from Merest of an

intentional trespasser:

Suppose a gentleman has a paved walk in his paddock, before
his window, and that a man intrudes and walks up and down before the

window of his house, and looks in while the owner is at
dinner, is the trespasser permitted to say “here is a halfpenny for you which
is

the full extent of the mischief I have done.” Would that be
a compensation? I cannot say that it would be....

#5

McWilliams, 3 Wis. at 428. Thus, in the case establishing
punitive damages in this state, this court recognized that in certain
situations of

trespass, the actual harm is not in the damage done to the
land, which may be minimal, but in the loss of the individual’s right to
exclude others

from his or her property and, the court implied that this
right may be punished by a large damage award despite the lack of measurable
harm.

* * * The Jacques argue that both the individual and society
      have significant interests in deterring intentional trespass to land,
      regardless of

the lack of measurable harm that results. We agree with the
Jacques. An examination of the individual interests invaded by an intentional
trespass

to land, and society’s interests in preventing intentional
trespass to land, leads us to the conclusion that the Barnard rule should not
apply when

the tort supporting the award is intentional trespass to
land.

We turn first to the individual landowner’s interest in
protecting his or her land from trespass. The United States Supreme Court has

recognized that the private landowner’s right to exclude
others from his or her land is “one of the most essential sticks in the bundle
of rights that

are commonly characterized as property.” Dolan v. City of
Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, 384 (1994). This court has long recognized “[e]very
person[’s]

constitutional right to the exclusive enjoyment of his own
property for any purpose which does not invade the rights of another person.”
Diana

Shooting Club v. Lamoreaux, 89 N.W. 880, 886 (Wis. 1902)
(holding that the victim of an intentional trespass should have been allowed to
take

judgment for nominal damages and costs). Thus, both this
court and the Supreme Court recognize the individual’s legal right to exclude
others

from private property.

Yet a right is hollow if the legal system provides
insufficient means to protect it. Felix Cohen offers the following analysis
summarizing the

relationship between the individual and the state regarding
property rights:

[T]hat is property to which the following label can be
attached:

To the world:

Keep off X unless you have my permission, which I may grant
or withhold.

Signed: Private Citizen

Endorsed: The state

Felix S. Cohen, Dialogue on Private Property, 9 Rutgers Law
Review 357, 374 (1954). Harvey and Lois Jacque have the right to tell Steenberg

Homes and any other trespasser, “No, you cannot cross our
land.” But that right has no practical meaning unless protected by the State.
And, as

this court recognized as early as 1854, a “halfpenny” award
does not constitute state protection.

#6

The nature of the nominal damage award in an intentional
trespass to land case further supports an exception to Barnard. Because a legal

right is involved, the law recognizes that actual harm
occurs in every trespass. The action for intentional trespass to land is
directed at vindication

of the legal right. The law infers some damage from every
direct entry upon the land of another. The law recognizes actual harm in every
trespass

to land whether or not compensatory damages are awarded.
Thus, in the case of intentional trespass to land, the nominal damage award

represents the recognition that, although immeasurable in
mere dollars, actual harm has occurred.

The potential for harm resulting from intentional trespass
also supports an exception to Barnard. A series of intentional trespasses, as
the

Jacques had the misfortune to discover in an unrelated
action, can threaten the individual’s very ownership of the land. The conduct
of an

intentional trespasser, if repeated, might ripen into
prescription or adverse possession and, as a consequence, the individual
landowner can lose

his or her property rights to the trespasser. See Wis. Stat.
§ 893.28.

In sum, the individual has a strong interest in excluding
trespassers from his or her land. Although only nominal damages were awarded to

the Jacques, Steenberg’s intentional trespass caused actual
harm. We turn next to society’s interest in protecting private property from
the

intentional trespasser.

Society has an interest in punishing and deterring
intentional trespassers beyond that of protecting the interests of the
individual landowner.

Society has an interest in preserving the integrity of the
legal system. Private landowners should feel confident that wrongdoers who
trespass

upon their land will be appropriately punished. When
landowners have confidence in the legal system, they are less likely to resort
to “self-help”

remedies. In McWilliams, the court recognized the importance
of “ ‘prevent[ing] the practice of dueling, [by permitting] juries [ ] to
punish insult

by exemplary damages.’ ” McWilliams, 3 Wis. at 428. Although
dueling is rarely a modern form of self-help, one can easily imagine a
frustrated

landowner taking the law into his or her own hands when
faced with a brazen trespasser, like Steenberg, who refuses to heed no trespass

warnings.

People expect wrongdoers to be appropriately punished.
Punitive damages have the effect of bringing to punishment types of conduct
that,

though oppressive and hurtful to the individual, almost
invariably go unpunished by the public prosecutor. The $30 forfeiture was
certainly not

an appropriate punishment for Steenberg’s egregious trespass
in the eyes of the Jacques. It was more akin to Merest’s “halfpenny.” If
punitive

damages are not allowed in a situation like this, what
punishment will prohibit the intentional trespass to land? Moreover, what is to
stop

Steenberg Homes from concluding, in the future, that
delivering its mobile homes via an intentional trespass and paying the
resulting Class B

forfeiture, is not more profitable than obeying the law?
Steenberg

#7

Homes plowed a path across the Jacques’ land and dragged the
mobile home across that path, in the face of the Jacques’ adamant refusal. A $

forfeiture and a $1 nominal damage award are unlikely to
restrain Steenberg Homes from similar conduct in the future. An appropriate
punitive

damage award probably will.

In sum, as the court of appeals noted, the Barnard rule
sends the wrong message to Steenberg Homes and any others who contemplate

trespassing on the land of another. It implicitly tells them
that they are free to go where they please, regardless of the landowner’s
wishes. As

long as they cause no compensable harm, the only deterrent
intentional trespassers face is the nominal damage award of $1, the modern

equivalent of Merest’s halfpenny, and the possibility of a
Class B forfeiture under Wis. Stat. § 943.13. We conclude that both the private

landowner and society have much more than a nominal interest
in excluding others from private land. Intentional trespass to land causes
actual

harm to the individual, regardless of whether that harm can
be measured in mere dollars. Consequently, the Barnard rationale will not
support a

refusal to allow punitive damages when the tort involved is
an intentional trespass to land. Accordingly, assuming that the other
requirements for

punitive damages have been met, we hold that nominal damages
may support a punitive damage award in an action for intentional trespass to

land. * * *

In conclusion, we hold that when nominal damages are awarded
for an intentional trespass to land, punitive damages may, in the discretion

of the jury, be awarded. Our decision today shall apply to
Steenberg Homes. Finally, we hold that the $100,000 punitive damages awarded by
the

jury is not excessive. Accordingly, we reverse and remand to
the circuit court for reinstatement of the punitive damage award.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .There is no dispute in this case that Steenberg Homes
committed an intentional trespass by moving the mobile home across the Jacques’
farm

field. The law of intentional trespass is “exceptionally
simple and exceptionally rigorous.” William L. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of
Torts 63 ( 4 th ed.

1971 ). Any intentional intrusion that deprives another of
possession of land, even if only temporarily, is considered a trespass.
Restatement (Fourth) of

Property, Vol. 2 , Div. I, Ch. 1 , § 1. 1. (Am. L. Inst.
Tentative Draft Apr. 7 , 2021 ). The only intent required is to go onto the
land; it is not necessary to

show that the defendant knew where the boundary was or that
the land belonged to someone else. Intentional trespass is sometimes said to be
a strict

liability tort, because there is no inquiry into the balance
of interests between the plaintiff and defendant or whether the intrusion was
“unreasonable.”

Perhaps most strikingly, someone who commits an intentional
trespass is subject to liability “irrespective of whether he thereby causes
_any_ harm to any

legally protected interest of the other.” Id. (emphasis
added). In this sense, trespass to land is like the tort of battery. As one
English judge put it: “So if a

man gives another a cuff on the ear, though it

```



8



```

cost him nothing, no not so much as a little diachylon, yet
he shall have his action, for it is a personal injury. So a man shall have an
action against

another for riding over his ground, though it do him no
damage; for it is an invasion of his property, and the other has no right to
come there.” Ashby v.

White, 92 Eng. Rep. 126 , 137 (K.B. 1703 ) (Holt, C.J.).
Does this suggest that a person’s land is seen as an extension of her body, and
that the law

protects both in order to vindicate fundamental rights of
personal autonomy? As we will see in Chapter IV, the law is not so protective
of personal

property (also known as “chattels,” “movable things,” or
“goods”). The _Restatement of Torts_ says that a trespass to personal property
will result in

liability only if it causes harm to the owner of the thing.
Restatement (Second) of Torts § 218 cmt. e. What might account for this
difference?

2 .One historical explanation for the absence of any harm
requirement is that the action for trespass to land was often used to resolve
disputes over

title to land. Suppose A and B are neighbors and they
disagree about the location of the boundary between their properties. Even
though neither has

done anything to harm the other, A can sue B (or vice versa)
for trespass, and the court, in the course of deciding the dispute, will
determine where in

fact the boundary lies between their two parcels. If a
showing of harm were required, then either A or B would have to take some
action—like erecting a

fence or trampling a flower bed—in order to get the boundary
dispute resolved, but it is obviously undesirable to require harmful acts from
persons who

would not otherwise undertake them, simply in order to
resolve their respective rights to land. With the twentieth-century development
of so-called quiet

title actions (in which any interested person can seek a
declaratory judgment resolving a dispute over title to land), however, this
rationale has lost most

of its force. Does this reform suggest that the action for
trespass should now be limited to intrusions that cause actual harm?

3 .Did the Jacques have a sound reason for refusing
permission to Steenberg Homes to move the mobile home across their field? The
Jacques

testified that they were sensitive about intrusions on their
land because they had lost some of their property in an adverse possession
lawsuit. Adverse

possession, which we take up in Chapter II, is in effect a
transfer of ownership that takes place when someone occupies land _without
permission_ , and the

statute of limitations runs before the owner challenges the
occupation. If the Jacques had given their permission to Steenberg employees to
cut across

their land, there would have been no basis to assert a claim
for adverse possession. In any event, the statute of limitations for
challenging trespass to land

in Wisconsin is 20 years, Wis. Stat. § 893. 25 , and the
Steenberg moving operation would last only a few hours. So the Jacques’ stated
reason for

objecting to the shortcut had no objective basis in law.
Should this make a difference in deciding whether they should be allowed to sue
for trespass, or

to whether they should be allowed to recover $ 100 , 000 in
punitive damages?

4 .Even if the Jacques had no sound reason for objecting to
Steenberg Homes cutting across their land, why might the legal system want a
rule that

always (or nearly always) requires permission of the owner
before people are allowed to intrude? Most of the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s

```

```

discussion of this point seems to assume the conclusion: The
right to exclude must be enforced because it is an important right. The court
suggests two

reasons for strictly enforcing such a right: to avoid
potential violence and protect privacy rights. But is either concern implicated
in the facts of this case?

Should that matter in deciding whether to apply the strict
rule? Are these arguments ultimately circular? People might not resort to
violence to repel

intruders if they understood that they did not have the
right to exclude trespasses that do no injury to their land. And people might
not be so sensitive

about their privacy rights if these trespasses were
tolerated. Can you think of other reasons for giving owners a near-absolute
right to exclude others?

5 .Maneuvering a mobile home around a sharp curve in a
country road with seven feet of snow on the ground sounds as if it might be
quite

dangerous, and could risk bodily injury to Steenberg
employees or physical damage to the mobile home. Do you think the court should
have taken this

into account? Courts in some circumstances have recognized a
defense of necessity to an action for trespass (see Chapter IV). It is well
established that

travelers have a right to deviate from a public road when it
is rendered impassable, and, as we will see, this exception to the right to
exclude sometimes

comes under the heading of “necessity.” Dwyer v. Staunton, [
1947 ] 4 D.L.R. 393 (Alberta Dist. Ct.) (holding there to be no trespass in a
case of travel

on private land where public road was made impassable by
snow, despite the objection of the owner). Should Steenberg Homes be able to
claim

necessity here? If not, why not?

6 .The U.S. Supreme Court has held that “grossly excessive
or arbitrary” punitive damages awards violate due process, State Farm Mutual

Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408 , 416 ( 2003
), and has indicated that ratios of punitive to compensatory damages exceeding
nine to one

are presumptively suspect as a matter of constitutional law.
The punitive damages in _Jacque_ are 100 , 000 times the compensatory damages.
The Court

also has instructed that one factor in determining whether
an award is excessive is the relationship between the award and the maximum
civil or criminal

penalty the state authorizes for similar conduct. State
Farm, 583 U.S. at 428 ; BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559 , 583
( 1996 ).

According to an omitted portion of the opinion in _Jacque,_
the maximum fine under Wisconsin law for misdemeanor trespass was $ 1 , 000.
The award in

_Jacque_ is 100 times this amount. On both measures,
therefore, the punitive damages award seems suspect. On the other hand, the
Court has also noted

that an award in excess of nine times compensatory damages
“may comport with due process where a particularly egregious act has resulted
in only a

small amount of economic damages.” State Farm, supra, at 426
(internal quotations marks omitted, citing BMW, 517 U.S. at 582 ) (noting that
a higher

ratio might be necessary where “the injury is hard to detect
or the monetary value of noneconomic harm might have been difficult to
determine”). Does

this exception apply here? Is the $ 1 , 000 ceiling set by
the legislature for misdemeanor trespass an accurate benchmark of the social
consequences of

intentional trespass to unenclosed land? Is it possible that
the purpose of the criminal trespass provision is not really to deter

trespasses, so much as to provide a mechanism for the
sheriff’s department to mediate disputes like the one between the Jacques and
Steenberg Homes?

#### Hinman v. Pacific Air Transport

```



United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, 1936.



84 F. 2 d 755.



```

■ HANEY,
CIRCUIT JUDGE. From decrees sustaining motions to dismiss filed by defendants
in two suits, appellants appeal and bring for review by

this court the rights of a landowner in connection with the
flight of aircraft above his land. Appellant filed one bill against Pacific Air
Transport,

an Oregon corporation, and another bill against United Air
Lines Transport Corporation, a Delaware corporation, in each of which the
allegations

are nearly identical. Although two appeals are before the
court, briefs filed discuss both cases, and therefore we will consider them
together. * * *

It is * * * alleged that defendants are engaged in the
business of operating a commercial air line, and that at all times “after the
month of

May, 1929, defendants daily, repeatedly and upon numerous
occasions have disturbed, invaded and trespassed upon the ownership and

possession of plaintiffs’ tract”; that at said times
defendants have operated aircraft in, across, and through said airspace at
altitudes less than 100

feet above the surface; that plaintiffs notified defendants
to desist from trespassing on said airspace; and that defendants have
disregarded said

notice, unlawfully and against the will of plaintiffs, and
continue and threaten to continue such trespasses. * * *

The prayer asks an injunction restraining the operation of
the aircraft through the airspace over plaintiffs’ property and for $90,000
damages

in each of the cases.

Appellees contend that it is settled law in California that
the owner of land has no property rights in superjacent airspace, either by
code

enactments or by judicial decrees and that the ad coelum
doctrine * does not apply in California. We have examined the statutes of
California,

particularly California Civil Code, § 659 and § 829, as well
as Grandona v. Lovdal, 21 P. 366 (Cal. 1889); Wood v. Moulton, 80 P. 92 (Cal.

1905); and Kafka v. Bozio, 218 P. 753 (Cal. 1923), but we
find nothing therein to negative the ad coelum formula. Furthermore, if we
should

adopt this formula as being the law, there might be serious
doubt as to whether a state statute could change it without running counter to
the

Fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United
States. If we could accept and literally construe the ad coelum doctrine, it
would

simplify the solution of this case; however, we reject that
doctrine. We think it is not the law, and that it never was the law.

#11

Figure 1-

Timetable for Pacific Air Transport, February 1, 1928

From the Collection of Craig Morris.

This formula “from the center of the earth to the sky” was
invented at some remote time in the past when the use of space above land
actual

or conceivable was confined to narrow limits, and simply
meant that the owner of the land could use the overlying space to such an
extent as he

was able, and that no one could ever interfere with that
use.

This formula was never taken literally, but was a figurative
phrase to express the full and complete ownership of land and the right to

whatever superjacent airspace was necessary or convenient to
the enjoyment of the land.

In applying a rule of law, or construing a statute or
constitutional provision, we cannot shut our eyes to common knowledge, the
progress of

civilization, or the experience of mankind. A literal
construction of this formula will bring about an absurdity. The sky has no
definite location. It

is that which presents itself to the eye when looking
upward; as we approach it, it recedes. There can be no ownership of infinity,
nor can equity

prevent a supposed violation of an abstract conception.

The appellants’ case, then, rests upon the assumption that
as owners of the soil they have an absolute and present title to all the space
above

the earth’s surface, owned by them, to such a height as is,
or may become, useful to the enjoyment of their land. This height, the
appellants assert

in the bill, is of indefinite distance, but not less than
150 feet. * * * This, then, is appellants’ premise, and upon this proposition
they rest their

case. Such an inquiry was never pursued in the history of
jurisprudence until the occasion is furnished by the common use of vehicles of
the air.

We believe, and hold, that appellants’ premise is unsound.
The question presented is applied to a new status and little aid can be found
in

actual precedent. The solution is found in the application
of elementary legal principles. The first and foremost of these principles is
that the very

essence and origin of the legal right of property is
dominion

#12

over it. Property must have been reclaimed from the general
mass of the earth, and it must be capable by its nature of exclusive
possession.

Without possession, no right in it can be maintained.

The air, like the sea, is by its nature incapable of private
ownership, except in so far as one may actually use it. This principle was

announced long ago by Justinian. It is in fact the basis
upon which practically all of our so-called water codes are based.

We own so much of the space above the ground as we can
occupy or make use of, in connection with the enjoyment of our land. This right

is not fixed. It varies with our varying needs and is
coextensive with them. The owner of land owns as much of the space above him as
he uses,

but only so long as he uses it. All that lies beyond belongs
to the world.

When it is said that man owns, or may own, to the heavens,
that merely means that no one can acquire a right to the space above him that

will limit him in whatever use he can make of it as a part
of his enjoyment of the land. To this extent his title to the air is paramount.
No other

person can acquire any title or exclusive right to any space
above him.

Any use of such air or space by others which is injurious to
his land, or which constitutes an actual interference with his possession or
his

beneficial use thereof, would be a trespass for which he
would have remedy. But any claim of the landowner beyond this cannot find a
precedent

in law, nor support in reason.

It would be, and is, utterly impracticable and would lead to
endless confusion, if the law should uphold attempts of landowners to stake
out,

or assert claims to definite, unused spaces in the air in
order to protect some contemplated future use of it. Such a rule, if adopted,
would

constitute a departure never before attempted by mankind,
and utterly at variance with the reason of the law. If such a rule were
conceivable, how

will courts protect the various landowners in their varying
claims of portions of the sky? How enforce a right of ejectment or restitution?
Such a

rule is not necessary for the protection of the landowner in
any right guaranteed him by the Constitution in the enjoyment of his property.
If a

right like this were recognized and upheld by the courts, it
would cause confusion worse confounded. It is opposed to common sense and to
all

human experience.

We cannot shut our eyes to the practical result of legal
recognition of the asserted claims of appellants herein, for it leads to a
legal

implication to the effect that any use of airspace above the
surface owner of land, without his consent would be a trespass either by the
operator

of an airplane or a radio operator. We will not foist any
such chimerical concept of property rights upon the jurisprudence of this
country.

We now consider the allegation of the bill that appellees’
airplanes, in landing, glide through the air, within a distance of less than
100 feet

to the surface of appellants’ land, or possibly to a
distance within five feet thereof, at one end of his tract. This presents
another question for

#13

discussion. Whether such close proximity to appellants’ land
may constitute an impairment of his full enjoyment of the same is a question of

fact. If it does, he may be entitled to relief in a proper
case.

Appellants are not entitled to injunctive relief upon the
bill filed here, because no facts are alleged with respect to circumstances of

appellants’ use of the premises which will enable this court
to infer that any actual or substantial damage will accrue from the acts of the

appellees complained of.

The case differs from the usual case of enjoining a
trespass. Ordinarily, if a trespass is committed upon land, the plaintiff is
entitled to at

least nominal damages without proving or alleging any actual
damage. In the instant case, traversing the airspace above appellants’ land is
not, of

itself, a trespass at all, but it is a lawful act unless it
is done under circumstances which will cause injury to appellants’ possession.

Appellants do not, therefore, in their bill state a case of
trespass, unless they allege a case of actual and substantial damage. The bill
fails to

do this. It merely draws a naked conclusion as to damages
without facts or circumstances to support it. It follows that the complaint
does not

state a case for injunctive relief. * * *

The decree of the District Court is affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Some version of the _ad coelum_ principle (see n. *
supra) is followed in nearly all legal systems for purposes of defining the
right to exclude

others from land. See Andrea B. Carroll, Examining a
Comparative Law Myth: Two Hundred Years of Riparian Misconception, 80 Tul. L.
Rev. 901 ,

912 – 19 ( 2006 ). As Professor Carroll recounts, the rule
was extracted from Roman law, and given its Latin name, by medieval monks known
as

Glossators working in Italy in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries. One of these Glossators, Franciscus, was brought to England by King
Edward I in

1273 , which led to the introduction of the concept to
English law. Lord Coke invoked the concept by its Latin name in some cases in
the seventeenth

century, and also noted it in his _Institutes_. See 1
Edwardo Coke, The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England; Or, A
Commentary upon

Littleton, § 4 a (Francis Hargrave & Charles Butler
eds., 16 th ed. 1809 ) ( 1628 ). All this, of course, was well before airplanes
were invented.

2 .The _ad coelum_ principle is fundamental to property in
land. Deeds to land nearly always are stated in terms of some measurement of
the surface

area. But under the _ad coelum_ principle, the owner of the
surface is also entitled to dig below the surface (for example, to construct a
basement for a

house) and to build above the surface (for example, to
construct a two-story house). Without such an understanding, obviously, the
bare right to the

surface would be largely worthless. Rights to the column of
space above the surface are often referred to as “air rights.” Absent some
zoning restriction

```



14



```

or covenant restricting the height of buildings, the _ad
coelum_ principle means that the owner of the surface can construct a building
as tall as engineering

prowess will allow. Thus, a farmer in an unzoned area of
rural Illinois could replicate the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) on
his land, provided

he could obtain financing for the project. Height
restrictions are common in zoning ordinances, however, and these have been held
to be a legitimate

exercise of the police power, not requiring any payment of
compensation. See Welch v. Swasey, 214 U.S. 91 , 106 – 07 ( 1909 ); see also
Penn Central

Transp. Co. v. City of New York, 438 U.S. 104 ( 1978 ),
reproduced in Chapter X. We take up some of the issues presented by the _ad
coelum_ principle’s

application to subsurface rights in Chapter II.

3 .The question whether airplane overflights are trespasses
under the _ad coelum_ principle was always more theoretically interesting than
practically

important. No court (as far as we are aware) has ever
concluded that operators of airplanes could be held liable in trespass for
flying at cruise altitudes

over land below. The injury to each surface owner is small
or nonexistent, and the transaction costs of negotiating permissions with each
owner would

be so large that they would make it impossible to fly
airplanes. Courts are far too pragmatic to take such an extreme assertion of
rights seriously. The

puzzle in _Hinman_ (and similar cases involving airplane
overflights) is how to carve out an exception for overflights from the _ad
coelum_ principle

without otherwise damaging the rule’s general utility. Four
different doctrinal moves have been suggested at various times to accomplish
this excision.

( 1 )The action for trespass is available only to persons
who are in possession of land. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 158 (a). One
argument,

therefore, is that as long as the owner of the surface has
not asserted dominion and control over the portion of the column of space in
which airplanes fly,

the owner cannot sue in trespass. The problem with this
argument is that the owner of land is generally regarded as being in
“constructive” possession of

the land sufficient to maintain trespass, even if the owner
is not in actual possession. 87 C.J.S. Trespass § 25 ( 2000 ). For example,
although the Jacques

do not appear to have been in active control of the portion
of their farm where Steenberg Homes trespassed, this did not defeat their right
to sue for

trespass. Similarly, the _ad coelum_ principle seems to
recognize that the owner of the surface has a kind of exclusive option to build
up into the column of

space in the future, without regard to whether that space is
currently possessed. Thus, it might make more sense to say that owners have an
exclusive

“right to possess” at least as far up as building technology
makes effective possession possible. See Smith v. New England Aircraft Co., 170
N.E. 385 ,

393 (Mass. 1930 ). Perhaps the notion of possession itself
needs to be better specified than was necessary in earlier times. Restatement
(Fourth) of

Property, Vol. 1 , Div. II, Ch. 1 (Am. L. Inst. Council
Draft No. 1 , Sept. 13 , 2019 ); Christopher M. Newman, Using Things, Defining
Property, in

Property Theory 69 , 89 – 98 (James Penner & Michael
Otsuka, eds. 2018 ); Henry E. Smith, The Persistence of System in Property Law,
163 U. Pa. L.

Rev. 2055 , 2079 – 80 ( 2015 ).

```

( 2 )One could argue that airplane overflights are
actionable as trespasses only if they cause actual harm to the surface owner.
The problem with this

argument is, as we have seen, that actual injury or harm is
not a traditional element of trespass to land. Again, even though the Jacques
did not suffer any

actual harm because of the trespass by Steenberg Homes, they
were allowed to recover in an action for trespass.

( 3 )Richard Epstein has argued that airplane overflights
are technically trespasses, but the surface owner is not entitled to any
damages or other

relief because she obtains “implicit in kind compensation”
from being able to take advantage of the benefits that airplane travel has to
offer—that is,

from being able to commit similar trespasses over other
people’s property. See Richard A. Epstein, _Intel v. Hamidi_ : The Role of
Self-Help in

Cyberspace?, 1 J.L. Econ. & Pol’y 147 , 154 – 55 ( 2005
). In effect, every surface owner has implicitly granted a license to every
other person to trespass

over her property, since this makes everyone in society
better off. In a related argument, Eric Claeys sees the _ad coelum_ regime as
evolving flexibly

because it is ultimately grounded in productive use. Eric R.
Claeys, On the Use and Abuse of Overflight Column Doctrine, 2 Brigham-Kanner
Prop. Rts.

Conf. J. 61 ( 2013 ). Do these arguments rest too heavily on
hindsight? When airplane travel first developed and challenges were brought
based on

trespass, no one could be sure air travel would work out to
the benefit of all. Today we can say this is undoubtedly true, but it may not
have been

obvious at the dawn of air travel.

( 4 )One could reclassify the airspace in which airplanes
travel as a type of public property—public navigable airspace—in which no
surface owner

has any claim of private property rights. The analogy would
be to navigable rivers or public highways, which are considered public property
open to all.

A problem with this theory is that the declaration of public
ownership of the navigable airspace might be regarded as a taking of private
property, given

the previous understanding that the surface owner owns “to
the heavens.” But even if it were a taking, the compensation might be small or
nothing,

given the absence of harm and the “implicit compensation”
emphasized by Epstein.

For more on the history of the law of airplane overflights,
see Stuart Banner, Who Owns the Sky?: The Struggle to Control Airspace from the

Wright Brothers On ( 2008 ).

4 .Which of these legal arguments is embraced by the Court
in _Hinman_? The U.S. Supreme Court eventually embraced the fourth theory in
_United

States v. Causby_ , 328 U.S. 256 ( 1946 ). The Court
concluded that Congress had effectively asserted federal government control
over navigable airspace.

The Court also concluded that the legislative declaration of
federal ownership was not a taking of property, unless the flights come in so
low over the

property as to destroy the use and enjoyment of the surface
area and improvements. For more on _Causby_ , see Chapter III. Which solution
to the problem

of overflights do you find the most appealing?

```



5 .Farmer Hinman and the Burbank airport were not on good
terms. A subsequent opinion gives more background. Hinman had tried to get the



```

```



16



```

airport to purchase or lease his entire 72. 5 - acre parcel,
but the airport refused on the ground that Hinman’s asking price was far above
fair market value.

In response to his loss in the litigation and the holding
that he was entitled to only so much airspace as he was actually using, Hinman
erected 20 - foot

poles and a large derrick in the flight path to the airport.
The airport offered to pay the cost of removal or of installation of warning
lights, and Hinman

refused. When the airport sued, the court enjoined the
structures as a private and public nuisance. United Airports Co. of California
v. Hinman et al.,

1940 U.S. Av. Rep. 1 (S.D. Cal. 1939 ). The Burbank airport
was much favored by movie stars and other celebrities and was frequently used
to shoot

films. Was Hinman a spiteful opportunist? If so, is the law
of nuisance (considered in _Hendricks v. Stalnaker_ infra) more suited to
controlling his

behavior than the law of trespass?

6 .Aerial trespass has emerged as a more pressing issue with
the advent of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), popularly known as drones.
Drones

typically fly lower and can hover, potentially coming into
more conflict with landowners’ uses and invading their privacy. Drones are
coming to play an

important role in many contexts, from public safety to
consumer deliveries. Should landowners have to show substantial harm from a
drone overflight to

sue in trespass? Even if the drone is one inch above the
ground? Even if a drone on a fishing pole dangled over the land would be a per
se trespass?

Moving upwards from the surface, where does the landowner’s
possession (or right to possess) stop and the navigation servitude begin, or do
they

overlap? We will return to the navigation servitude in
Chapter II. For more discussion, see Troy A. Rule, Airspace in an Age of
Drones, 95 B.U. L. Rev.

155 ( 2015 ); Henry E. Smith, Property Beyond Flatland, 10
Brigham-Kanner Prop. Rts. J. 9 ( 2021 ).

7 .The problem of airplane overflights also reemerged in
debates about the assembly of digital databases. In particular, the Google
Books project

makes and stores copies of the full text of millions of
published books, and allows users to search for and view snippets of the works.
Google prevailed

on its argument that all this was fair use, Authors Guild v.
Google, Inc., 804 F. 3 d 202 ( 2 d Cir. 2015 ), but in the course of the
controversy, commentators

such as Larry Lessig defended the project on the grounds
that the problem is essentially the same as that of airplane overflights: The
injury to each

author is small or nonexistent, and the transaction costs of
negotiating consents with each copyright owner would be so large as to make the
project of

creating such a database infeasible. They argued that just
as the courts carved out an exception to the law of trespass for overflights,
so they should carve

out an exception from copyright law for use of copyrighted
books in creating large searchable databases. Claeys, supra, at 99 – 108. Does
Lessig’s

argument suggest that there may be other circumstances in
which exceptions to trespass law should be recognized based on small injury to
the

landowner and high transaction costs of negotiating
permissions? Should the same reasoning apply to the use of fracking technology
to extract oil and

gas from the ground? Coastal Oil & Gas Corp. v. Garza
Energy Tr., 268 S.W. 3 d 1 , 11 (Tex. 2008 ) (invoking the airplane overflight
analogy). See also

Briggs v. Southwestern Energy Production Co., excerpted in
Chapter II; and see

#17

generally Chapter IV.B (considering various other exceptions
to the landowner’s right to exclude). If as James Grimmelmann argues, courts
give close

and exacting scrutiny to uses of copyrighted material by
humans but fast-track use through robotic readers, James Grimmelmann, Copyright
for Literate

Robots, 101 Iowa L. Rev. 657 , 667 ( 2016 ), where should
this leave autonomous drones under the _ad coelum_ principle?

### 2 .CONCEPTIONS OF PROPERTY—PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVES

Scholars who seek to identify the meaning of property tend
to fall into two camps. On the one hand, there are the essentialists, who
attempt

to uncover the single true definition of property as a legal
concept. Essentialist efforts can be more or less complex. In an often-quoted
passage,

William Blackstone, with a bit of self-conscious drama,
wrote: “There is nothing which so generally strikes the imagination, and
engages the

affections of mankind, as the right of property; or that
sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external
things

of the world, in total exclusion of the right of any other
individual in the universe.” 2 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of
England

*2 (1766). This reflects a relatively simple essentialist
conception: Property confers a kind of exclusive sovereign control over some
“external

thing.” Others have come up with more complex
characterizations of property that are still essentialist, in that they are
premised on the

understanding that there is one correct meaning of property.
For example, Tony Honoré, an English analytical philosopher, has developed a

conception of what “full ownership” means in a mature
liberal legal system that features no less than eleven elements. See Tony
Honoré,

Ownership, in Making Law Bind 161 (1987).

On the other hand, there are the skeptics, who believe that
it is fruitless to try to come up with a single canonical conception of what

property means in a legal system. For the skeptics,
“property” is just a word that means nothing until we spell out—using different
words—

exactly what we are talking about in any given context. The
skeptical view is reflected in the common metaphor that property is a “bundle
of

rights” or “bundle of sticks.” The metaphor was apparently
first used in a nineteenth century treatise, see John Lewis, Treatise on the
Law of

Eminent Domain in the United States 43 (1888), and gained
wider currency in the 1920s and 1930s. See, e.g., Benjamin N. Cardozo, The

Paradoxes of Legal Science 129 (1928). The metaphor implies
that one can add to or subtract from the bundle more or less without limit, and
still

talk about the bundle as property. Many of the Legal
Realists who came to the fore in the 19 30s shared this view of the plasticity
of property. The

skeptical perspective is also reflected in the first version
of the American Law Institute’s Restatement of Property. See Restatement of
Property

§ 10 (Am. L. Inst. 1936) (“The word ‘owner,’ as it is used
in this Restatement, means the person who has one or more interests.”).

#18

Although the skeptical tradition has the widest following
among American law professors today, essentialism is making something of a

comeback. We start with an excerpt from James Penner, an
English legal philosopher who defends the essentialist view, and then an
excerpt from

Tom Grey, a law professor who reflects the skeptical
tradition that dominates in America.

```

A right in rem is, roughly, a right in respect of a res , a
thing. The classic example is a property right. Rights in rem are characterized
as those

rights which bind “all the world,” that is, rights which
must be respected by all, or virtually all, of the subjects of the legal
system; everybody

must refrain from trespassing on my land. In contrast, a
right in personam is a right in the behaviour of some person, such as the right
to the

performance of a contract. Rights in personam bind only
specific individuals; only the other party to the contract has any obligations
which

correlate to one’s contractual rights. * * *

One may visualize the holder of a right in rem as standing
at the hub of a spoked wheel, with the spokes representing relations to a

multitude of duty-owers. Yet one may just as easily
visualize the ower of a duty not to interfere with property, i.e. the ower of a
duty in rem , in

exactly the position, at the hub, so to speak, except that
the spokes will represent relations to all those who hold property. These are
lousy

pictures, because a moment’s notice will confirm that any
trace of a res , like a bicycle or a pound note, is missing, which is something
of a

deficiency if we are trying to explain the normative
relation which comprises property. * * * But if we pay attention to the fact
that rights and

duties in rem do not refer to persons, not in the sense that
the property is not owned by persons, but in the sense that nothing to do with
any

particular individual’s personality is involved in the
normative guidance they offer, we may get somewhere. * * *

[I]n general, it is completely unknown to us whether any
given amount of property is owned by one person or by several or many. * * * We

are under one duty to the plurality of property holders
however their property is distributed amongst themselves. It is a simple,
single duty, and

very easy to comply with. * * * As I walk through a car
park, my actual, practical duty is only capable of being understood as a duty
which

applies to the cars there, not to a series of owners. For
all I know, the cars are owned by the same person. The content of my duty not
to interfere

is not structured in any way by the actual ownership
relation of the cars’ owners to their specific cars. By the same token, if one
of the cars has

just been sold, so that there is a new owner, or if one of
the cars has been lent to the owner’s sister-in-law, again, my duty has not
changed one

whit. Thus transactions between an owner and a specific

#19

other do not change the duties of everyone else not to
interfere with the property. * * *

The concepts of exclusion and use are more complex than they
first appear, because, in general, they are intertwined. One can, of course,

have a right to use something without having a right to
exclude others, and vice versa. One can have the right to use a library, but no
right to

exclude others from it. Similarly a guard may have the right
to exclude others from the library but no right to use it himself.

Yet rights purely to exclude or purely to use interact
naturally, as it were, in the sense that use almost always involves some
exclusion of

others. As a rightful user of a library, I may not have the
right to exclude others, but I would certainly have the right to occupy a desk,
or take a

book from a shelf. In this sense I have a right not to be
excluded from the library, since use implies non-exclusion. * * *

How do the right to use and the right to exclude explain the
right to property? The right to property is grounded by the interest we have in

using things in the broader sense. No one has any interest
in merely excluding others from things, for any reason and no reason at all.
The

interest that underpins the right to property is the
interest we have in purposefully dealing with things. Because we have long-term
interests in

respect of things, and interests in using them in many
different ways the broad definition of use is the appropriate one. But because
we are

concerned with the right to property, we must be concerned
with the correlative duties imposed on others. Because of the social setting in
which

we live, we see that any meaningful right to use is the
opposite side of the coin to a right to exclude. Secondly, the right to use
reflects our

practical interest in exclusively using things, which
correlates to duties in rem on everyone else not to interfere with our uses of
things. Their not

using the property is framed in terms of their duties to
exclude themselves from it.

Thus at a theoretical level we understand the right to
property equally as a right of exclusion or a right of use, since they are
opposite sides

of the same coin. Yet we can equally see that only one of
these ways of looking at the right might drive the analysis in understanding
the shape of

the property norms in the legal system. It is my contention
that the law of property is driven by an analysis which takes the perspective
of

exclusion, rather than one which elaborates a right to use.
In other words, in order to understand property, we must look to the way that
the law

contours the duties it imposes on people to exclude
themselves from the property of others, rather than regarding the law as
instituting a series of

positive liberties or power to use particular things. This
can be expressed as follows, in what I will call the exclusion thesis: the
right to property

is a right to exclude others from things which is grounded
by the interest we have in the use of things.

On this formulation use serves a justificatory role for the
right, while exclusion is seen as the formal essence of the right. It is our
interest in

#20

the use of property which grounds the right in rem to
property and the correlative general duty in rem ; yet exclusion is the
practical means by

which that interest is protected, and that makes all the
difference to our understanding of property. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The distinction between rights _in rem_ and _in personam_
is fundamental to the law of property, and we will encounter it periodically
throughout

these materials. The distinction concerns who bears the duty
to respect the right. An in rem right creates duties in a large and indefinite
class of others

(“all the world” is the expression often used with some
exaggeration) to respect the right. An in personam right creates a duty in only
a small and

definitely ascertained number of others (e.g., B owes a duty
to A). Not all in rem rights (as defined) are property rights. Rights of bodily
security,

reputation, and privacy are also in rem in the sense that
they create duties of noninterference in a large and indefinite class of
others. These are basic

duties created by tort law. What makes something an in rem
right of property is the recognition of duties in a large and indefinite class
of others not to

interfere with some _thing_ (as opposed to a duty not to
interfere with a person). Clearly, one can also have in personam rights with
respect to things, in

the sense of rights that create duties on the part of only a
small number of ascertained others. Contract rights are the clear example. Very
roughly

speaking—and we emphasize the “very”—the law of torts as it
applies to persons and the core of the law of property establish in rem rights,
whereas the

law of contract establishes in personam rights. One
interesting implication of this distinction is that in rem rights tend to be
simple, easy-to-understand

duties of noninterference (like “no hitting” or “no
trespassing”). This is because the duty that corresponds to the right has to be
observed by such a large

and indefinite mass of people. Complicated rights that
impose affirmative duties to take particular actions are more likely to be in
personam and hence

will be more likely to be imposed by contract or government
regulation. For further discussion see Thomas W. Merrill & Henry E. Smith,
The

Property/Contract Interface, 101 Colum. L. Rev. 773 ( 2001
); Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld, Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial

Reasoning, 26 Yale L.J. 710 ( 1917 ).

2 .Penner’s emphasis on the right to exclude captures the
attitude of the Wisconsin Supreme Court about the property rights of Harvey and
Lois

Jacque. The court justifies the punitive damages award as a
way of vindicating the Jacques’ right to exclude others from their land, which
the court says

is central to the understanding that the land is their
property. But what about the dispute in _Hinman_? The _Hinman_ court seems to
view property more as a

collection of rights, and the question whether this includes
the right to exclude airplane overflights depends on a considerations of
competing social

interests, not any a priori conception of what ownership
entails.

3 .Penner’s conception of property as the right to exclude
others from things grounded in our interest in the use of the thing seems to
fit ownership

of land and tangible personal property like cars—for most
purposes at least.

```



21



```

It may even fit certain intellectual property rights like
patents and copyrights, which are said to create a right to exclude others from
using certain

inventions or forms of expression. But how does Penner’s
conception apply to other interests we commonly call property, like stocks or
bonds or

money? Money started out as a tangible form of personal
property—gold and silver coins that have an intrinsic value. Then it turned
into pieces of paper

which promised to pay the bearer on demand a certain amount
of gold or silver. Today it is just “fiat” currency—a piece of paper (or a
digital entry in a

computer operated by a bank) of no intrinsic value but which
society recognizes as a unit of value that can be exchanged for goods and
services that

have intrinsic value. See James Willard Hurst, A Legal
History of Money in the United States, 1774 – 1970 ( 1973 ). We commonly think
of money as

property. But what exactly is the “thing” that the owner of
money is empowered to exclude others from under Penner’s exclusion model?

4 .If property rights, being in rem, create duties on the
part of all persons in a community to respect owned things, how do these
generalized duties

get started? Can it be said that everyone has agreed or
consented to being bound to respect property? If so, when and where was this
consent given? See,

e.g., Geraint Parry, John Locke 51 ( 1978 ); Jeremy Waldron,
The Right to Private Property 126 – 283 ( 1988 ).

5 .For other analyses that emphasize the centrality of the
right to exclude others to the understanding of the interests we call property,
see J.W.

Harris, Property and Justice 13 ( 1996 ); Waldron, supra, at
26 – 61 ; Shyamkrishna Balganesh, Demystifying the Right to Exclude: Of
Property,

Inviolability, and Automatic Injunctions, 31 Harv. J.L.
& Pub. Pol’y 593 ( 2008 ); Thomas W. Merrill, Property and the Right to
Exclude, 77 Neb. L. Rev.

730 ( 1998 ).

6 .In other parts of the book, Penner develops what he calls
the Separation Thesis: Something can only be an object of property if it is
contingently

associated with an owner. Penner, supra, at 111. Penner
builds on Frederick Pollock, who defined a legal “thing” as “some possible
matter of rights and

duties conceived as a whole and apart from all others, just
as, in the world of common experience, whatever can be separately perceived is
a thing.”

Frederick Pollock, What Is a Thing?, 10 L.Q. Rev. 318 , 318
( 1894 ). On this account, a “thing” is central to property:

```



[O]n the whole perhaps we have good ground for saying that
the ‘thing’ of legal contemplation, even when we have to do with a material



object, is not precisely the object as we find it in common
experience, but rather the entirety of its possible legal relations to persons.
We say



entirety, not sum, because the capacity of being conceived
as a distinct whole is a necessary attribute of an individual thing. What the



relations of a person to a thing can be must depend in fact
on the nature of the thing as continuous or discontinuous, corporeal or
incorporeal,



and in law on the character and the extent of the powers of
use and disposal which particular systems of law may recognize.

Id. at 320 – 21. Many legal systems denominate property as
the “law of things.” In the materials that follow, consider what role if any
the “legal thing”

plays. See Henry E. Smith, Property as the Law of Things,
125 Harv. L. Rev. 1691 ( 2012 ). Those who are skeptical about the right to
exclude tend also

to downplay the importance of things to property. Consider
the following.

#### Tom Grey, The Disintegration of Property

```



in NOMOS XXII: PROPERTY 69 – 71 (J. Pennock & J. Chapman
eds., 1980 ).



```

In the English-speaking countries today, the conception of
property held by the specialist (the lawyer or economist) is quite different
from

that held by the ordinary person. Most people, including
most specialists in their unprofessional moments, conceive of property as
things that are

owned by persons. To own property is to have exclusive
control of something—to be able to use it as one wishes, to sell it, give it
away, leave it

idle, or destroy it. Legal restraints on the free use of
one’s property are conceived as departures from an ideal conception of full
ownership.

By contrast, the theory of property rights held by the
modern specialist tends both to dissolve the notion of ownership and to
eliminate any

necessary connection between property rights and things.
Consider ownership first. The specialist fragments the robust unitary
conception of

ownership into a more shadowy “bundle of rights.” Thus, a
thing can be owned by more than one person, in which case it becomes necessary
to

focus on the particular limited rights each of the co-owners
has with respect to the thing. Further, the notion that full ownership includes
rights to

do as you wish with what you own suggest that you might sell
off particular aspects of your control—rights to certain uses, to profits from
the

thing, and so on. Finally, rights of use, profit, and the
like can be parceled out along a temporal dimension as well—you might sell your
control

over your property for tomorrow to one person, for the next
day to another, and so on. * * *

The same point can be made with respect to fragmentation of
ownership generally. When a full owner of a thing begins to sell off various of

his rights over it—the right to use it for this purpose
tomorrow, for that purpose next year, and so on—at what point does he cease to
be the

owner, and who then owns the thing? You can say that each
one of the many rights holders owns it to the extent of the right, or you can
say that

no one owns it. Or you can say, as we still tend to do, in
the vestigial deference to the lay conception of property, that some
conventionally

designated rights constitute “ownership.” The issue is seen
as one of terminology: nothing significant turns on it.

What, then, of the idea that property rights must be rights
in things? Perhaps we no longer need a notion of ownership, but surely property

rights are a distinct category from other legal rights, in
that they pertain to things. But this suggestion cannot withstand analysis
either; most

#23

property in the modern capitalist economy is intangible.
Consider the common forms of wealth: shares of stock in corporations, bonds,
various

kinds of commercial paper, bank accounts, insurance
policies—not to mention more arcane intangibles such as trademarks, patents,
copyrights,

franchises, and business goodwill.

In our everyday language, we tend to speak of these rights
as if they were attached to things. Thus we “deposit our money in the bank,” as
if

we were putting a thing in a place; but really we are
creating a complex set of abstract claims against an abstract legal
institution. We are told that

as insurance policy holders we “own a piece of the rock”;
but we really have other abstract claims against another abstract institution.
We think

of our share of stock in Megabucks Corporation as part
ownership in the Megabucks factory outside town; but really the Megabucks board
of

directors could sell the factory and go into another line of
business and we would still have the same claims on the same abstract
corporation.

Property rights can no longer be characterized as “rights of
ownership” or as “rights in things” by specialists in property. What, then, is
their

special characteristic? How do property rights differ from
rights generally—from human rights or personal rights or rights to life or
liberty, say?

Our specialists and theoreticians have no answer; or rather,
they have a multiplicity of widely differing answers, related only in that they
bear

some association or analogy, more or less remote, to the
common notion of property as ownership of things. * * *

The conclusion of all this is that discourse about property
has fragmented into a set of discontinuous usages. The more fruitful and useful
of

these usages are those stipulated by theorists; but these
depart drastically from each other and from common speech. Conversely, meanings
of

“property” in law that cling to their origin in the
thing-ownership conception are integrated least successfully into the general
doctrinal

framework of law, legal theory, and economics. It seems fair
to conclude from a glance at the range of current usages that the specialists
who

design and manipulate the legal structures of the advanced
capitalist economies could easily do without using the term “property” at all.

---

The substitution of the bundle-of-rights for a
thing-ownership conception of property has the ultimate consequence that
property ceases to

be an important category in legal and political theory. This
in turn has political implications[.] * * * The legal realists who developed
the bundle-

of-rights notion were on the whole supportive of the
regulatory and welfare state, and in the writings that develop the
bundle-of-rights

conception, a purpose to remove the sanctity that had
traditionally attached to the rights of property can often be discerned. * * *

I would want to deny, however, that the account and
explanation of the breakdown of the concept of property offered here is in the
last

analysis ideological, in the pejorative sense of a
mystifying or false

#24

apologetic. The development of a largely capitalist market
economy toward industrialism objectively demands formulation of its emergent

system of economic entitlements in something like the
bundle-of-rights form, which in turn must lead to the decline of property as a
central

category of legal and political thought.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Grey’s characterization of property as a contingent
bundle of rights seems to describe the inquiry in _Hinman_ fairly accurately.
The dispute is

over whether property in land does or does not include, as
one of the sticks in the bundle, the right to block airplane overflights.
Before the suit, there is

uncertainty about whether this is one of the features of
property in land. After the decision, we know it is not. According to the
bundle-of-rights view,

this is how we determine what “property” means, by building
up or cutting down the number of sticks in the bundle over time. But how does
the bundle-

of-sticks metaphor account for the great importance that the
Wisconsin Supreme Court in _Jacque_ and other courts attribute to the right to
exclude others

from things as a central feature of property?

2 .Part of the appeal of the bundle-of-sticks metaphor is
its “brass tacks” aspect. Proponents see it as cutting through verbiage to get
at what’s

really going on, in a scientifically respectable way. Shane
Nicholas Glackin, Back to Bundles: Deflating Property Rights Again, 20 Legal
Theory 1

( 2014 ). Penner has returned to this question to offer a
vigorous defense of the usefulness of higher-level concepts like property. J.E.
Penner, Property

Rights: A Re-Examination ( 2020 ). See also Christopher. M.
Newman, Using Things, Defining Property, in Property Theory 69 , 89 – 98 (James
Penner &

Michael Otsuka, eds. 2018 ).

3 .Do Penner and Grey fundamentally disagree about the
nature of the concept of property, or do they simply emphasize different
aspects of a

single but complex phenomenon? Penner, in seeking to
explicate the meaning of property, takes as his core case individual ownership
of land or tangible

personal property. When he moves beyond the core case later
in his book and takes up questions such as whether stocks, bonds, and money are

“property,” the analysis becomes more convoluted. Grey, for
his part, does not deny that most people, “including most specialists in their
unprofessional

moments,” have an intuitive conception of property as the
right to control things. His case for the “disintegration” of property rests on
emphasizing

specialized discourses that deal with issues at some remove
from the core case of individual ownership of things. If this characterization
of the two

readings is correct, then the question becomes: Which part
of the story should we emphasize—the messiness at the perimeter, or the clarity
at the core?

Can the decisions in _Jacque_ and _Hinman_ be reconciled the
same way—one dealing with the “normal” rule, the other with an “exception”? For
another

analysis that contrasts the thing-like view of property held
by “ordinary observers” with the bundle-of-sticks view employed by “scientific

policymakers,” see Bruce A. Ackerman, Private Property and
the Constitution ( 1977 ); see generally Thomas W. Merrill & Henry E.
Smith, What

### B. THE TRESPASS/NUISANCE DIVIDE

Jacque v. Steenberg Homes and Hinman v. Pacific Air
Transport represent two different responses to intentional trespasses to land
by

strangers. Another contrast, which exposes additional
questions about the nature of property rights, concerns the distinction between
invasions of

land by large objects (like house trailers or airplanes) and
interferences with the use and enjoyment of land caused by some activity on

neighboring land, like generating pollution or making
excessive noise. The latter sorts of interferences are governed by a different
common-law

doctrine—the law of nuisance—which has traits very different
from the law of trespass (at least the version applied in Jacque ).

### 1 .NUISANCE

#### Hendricks v. Stalnaker

```



Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, 1989.



380 S.E. 2 d 198.



```

■ NEELY,
JUSTICE: Walter S. Stalnaker, defendant below, appeals from a decision by the
Circuit Court of Lewis County declaring a water well

drilled on his property to be a private nuisance to Harry L.
Hendricks and Mary Hendricks, plaintiffs below. The Hendrickses, owners of the

property adjacent to that of Mr. Stalnaker, were refused a
Health Department permit for a septic system located within 100 feet of Mr.
Stalnaker’s

water well. The Circuit Court of Lewis County, based on a
jury verdict, found the water well to be a private nuisance and ordered its
abatement.

On appeal, Mr. Stalnaker argues that because his water well
was not an unreasonable use of his land, he is not liable for the effects on
the

Hendrickses’ property. We agree and, therefore, reverse the
decision of the circuit court.

Mr. Stalnaker owns approximately 10 acres of land situated
on Glady Fork Road, Lewis County. In 1985, Mr. Stalnaker constructed his

home on a 2.493 acre portion of the tract, and had two water
wells dowsed. One well was located behind his house and the other, near the

Hendrickses’ property. The rear well was near land disturbed
by a former strip mine and, therefore, the well produced poor quality water.
Except

for a small section of land near the Hendrickses’
property—the location of the second “dowsed” well—most of Mr. Stalnaker’s home
tract had

been disturbed by a strip mine. In August 1985, Mr.
Stalnaker spent approximately $3,000 in an unsuccessful attempt to treat the
water from the

rear well.

In 1984, the Hendrickses purchased approximately 2.95 acres
adjacent to Mr. Stalnaker’s property for a home site or a trailer

#26

development. On 31 December 1985, Mr. Hendricks met with the
Lewis County sanitarian to determine locations for a water well and a septic

system. The Health Department requires a distance of 100
feet between water wells and septic systems before it will issue permits.^2
Because the

Hendrickses’ land was too hilly or had been disturbed in
order to build a pond, the only location for a septic system on the tract was
near Mr.

Stalnaker’s property. On 13 January 1986, the Hendrickses
contacted the county sanitarian to visit their property to complete the septic
system

permit application. The county sanitarian said because of
snowy weather he would come out later in the week.

On 13 January 1986, Mr. Stalnaker called the sanitarian and
was told about the Hendrickses’ proposed septic system. Mr. Stalnaker was also

told that the county sanitarian would be unavailable on 14
January 1986 but could meet with him on 15 January 1986. On 14 January 1986,
Mr.

Stalnaker contacted a well driller, who applied for and
received a well drilling permit for the second well from the assistant
sanitarian. The well

was completed on 25 January 1986 but was not connected to
Mr. Stalnaker’s home until January 1987.

On 15 January 1986, the county sanitarian informed Mr.
Hendricks that no permit for his proposed septic system could be issued because

the absorption field for his septic system was within one
hundred feet of Mr. Stalnaker’s water well. Mr. Hendricks did install a septic
system

without a permit in January 1987; however, the system was
left inoperative pending the outcome of this suit.

The Hendrickses filed suit in the Circuit Court of Lewis
County on 29 January 1987 requesting (1) the water well be declared a private

nuisance, (2) the nuisance be abated, and (3) damages. In a
bifurcated trial, the jury found that the water well was a private nuisance and
the trial

judge ordered it to be abated. On the issue of damages the
jury found for the defendant and awarded no damages.

I

In the past we have broadly described what constitutes a
nuisance:

A nuisance is anything which annoys or disturbs the free use
of one’s property, or which renders its ordinary use or physical

occupation uncomfortable.... A nuisance is anything which
interferes with the rights of a citizen, either in person, property, the

enjoyment of his property, or his comfort.... A condition is
a nuisance when it clearly appears that enjoyment of property is

materially lessened, and physical comfort of persons in
their homes is materially interfered with thereby. (Citations omitted).

#27

Martin v. Williams, 93 S.E.2d 835, 844 (W. Va. 1956). * * *
This definition of nuisance includes acts or conditions that affect either the
general

public or a limited number of persons. In Hark v. Mountain
Fork Lumber Co., 34 S.E.2d 348, 354 (W. Va. 1945) we defined a public nuisance
as

that which “affects the general public as public, and [a
private nuisance as that which] injures one person or a limited number of
persons only.”

In order clearly to delineate between a public nuisance and
a private nuisance, we define a private nuisance as a substantial and

unreasonable interference with the private use and enjoyment
of another’s land. The definition of private nuisance includes conduct that is

intentional and unreasonable, negligent or reckless, or that
results in an abnormally dangerous conditions or activities in an inappropriate
place.

See W. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts § 87 at 580, §
89 at 593 (4th ed. 1971); Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 821D, 821F, 822
(1979);

W. Keeton, Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts § 87 (5th
ed. 1984). Recovery for a private nuisance is limited to plaintiffs who have
suffered

a significant harm to their property rights or privileges
caused by the interference. Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 821E, 821F (1979).

Early West Virginia cases indicate that the existence of a
private nuisance was determined primarily by the harm caused. Medford v. Levy,
8

S.E. 302 (W. Va. 1888) (cooking odors); Flanagan v. Gregory
and Poole, Inc., 67 S.E.2d 865 (W. Va. 1951) (inadequate culvert). Gradually
the

focus included an examination of the reasonableness of the
property’s use. See McGregor v. Camden, 34 S.E. 936 (W. Va. 1899) (required an

examination of the location, capacity and management of oil
and gas well); Pope v. Edward M. Rude Carrier Corp., 75 S.E.2d 584 (W. Va.
1953)

(transportation of explosives); Martin, supra (used
automobile lot); State ex rel. Ammerman v. City of Philippi, 65 S.E.2d 713 (W.
Va. 1951) (tire

recapping business); Ritz v. Woman’s Club of Charleston, 173
S.E. 564 (W. Va. 1934) (noise); Harless v. Workman, 114 S.E.2d 548 (W. Va.

1960) (coal dust).

In the area of public nuisance, we have made explicit that
an examination of the “reasonableness or unreasonableness of the use of
property

in relation to the particular locality” is a fair test to
determine the existence of a public nuisance. Similarly, any determination of
liability for a

private nuisance must include an examination of the

#28

private use and enjoyment of the land seeking protection and
the nature of the interference.^5

Because the present case concerns conduct that is not a
negligent, reckless, or abnormally dangerous activity, our discussion of
private

nuisance is limited to conduct that is intentional and
unreasonable. An interference is intentional when the actor knows or should
know that the

conduct is causing a substantial and unreasonable
interference. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 825 (1979). The unreasonableness
of an

intentional interference must be determined by a balancing
of the landowners’ interests. An interference is unreasonable when the gravity
of the

harm outweighs the social value of the activity alleged to
cause the harm. See W. Prosser, supra § 87, at 581, § 89 at 596; Restatement
(Second)

of Torts § 826 (1979); W. Keeton, supra § 88, at 629.
Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 827 and 828 (1979) list some of the factors to
be

considered in determining the gravity of the harm and the
social value of the activity alleged to cause the harm.^6 However, this
balancing to

determine unreasonableness is not absolute. Additional
consideration might include the malicious or indecent conduct of the actor.
Restatement

(Second) of Torts § 829. * * *

In the case before us, the Hendrickses’ inability to operate
a septic system on their property is clearly a substantial interference with
the use

and enjoyment of their land. The record indicates that the
installation of the water well was intentional, but there was no evidence that
the

installation was done so as maliciously to deprive the
Hendrickses of a septic system. Mr. Stalnaker wanted to insure himself of an
adequate

water supply and found no alternative to the well he dug.

The critical question is whether the interference, the
installation of a water well, was unreasonable. Unreasonableness is determined
by

balancing the competing landholders’ interests. We note that
either use,

#29

well or septic system, burdens the adjacent property. Under
Health Department regulations, a water well merely requires non-interference
within

100 feet of its location. In the case of a septic system,
however, the 100 foot safety zone, extending from the edge of the absorption
field, may

intrude on adjacent property. Thus, the septic system, with
its potential for drainage, places a more invasive burden on adjacent
property.^7 Clearly

both uses present similar considerations of gravity of harm
and social value of the activity alleged to cause the harm. Both a water well
and a

septic system are necessary to use this land for housing;
together they constitute the in and out of many water systems. Neither party
has an

inexpensive and practical alternative. The site of the water
well means quality water for Mr. Stalnaker, and the Hendrickses have only one

location available for their septic system.

In the case before us, we are asked to determine if the
water well is a private nuisance. But if the septic system were operational,
the same

question could be asked about the septic system.^8 Because
of the similar competing interests, the balancing of these landowners’
interests is at

least equal or, perhaps, slightly in favor of the water
well. Thus, the Hendrickses have not shown that the balancing of interests
favors their septic

system. We find that the evidence presented clearly does not
demonstrate that the water well is an unreasonable use of land and, therefore,
does

not constitute a private nuisance. * * *

We find that because the evidence is not disputed and only
one [inference] is reasonable, the trial court should have held as a matter of
law

that the water well was not a private nuisance. * * *

Reversed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The law of nuisance, in contrast to the conventional (
_Jacque_ - style) law of trespass, is neither simple nor rigorous. In fact,
commentators have

described nuisance doctrine as so complex and uncertain that
it amounts to an “impenetrable jungle.” William L. Prosser, Handbook of the Law
of Torts

571 ( 4 th ed. 1971 ). The _Restatement of Torts_ valiantly
seeks to bring some order to this complexity by providing that a nuisance is an
interference with

the use and enjoyment of land that causes “significant harm”
and is “unreasonable.” Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 821 F, 822. The primary
definition

of “unreasonable,” according to the _Restatement_ , is that
“the gravity of the harms outweighs the utility of the actor’s conduct.” Id. §
826. The _Hendricks_

court, which generally follows the _Restatement_ , reads
this to

```



30



```

mean that nuisance liability turns on “balancing the
competing landowners’ interests.”

2 .How does the court here arrive at the conclusion of
reasonableness? The court says that the value of the competing interests is
“similar,” or

“perhaps” is “slightly in favor of the water well.” Does the
opinion give any reasons that might support this conclusion? Should the court,
following the

guidance of the _Restatement_ , have conducted a more
rigorous (and perhaps quantified) analysis of the costs and benefits of septic
tanks and water wells

before deciding the reasonableness issue? Why do you suppose
the court did not do this? If a rigorous cost-benefit analysis is not required,
should the

question of reasonableness be regarded as one of fact? If
so, why shouldn’t the court accept as controlling the jury’s determination that
the well was a

nuisance?

3 .Although the _Restatement_ is widely followed—or at least
cited—in modern nuisance cases, it is by no means the only possible approach
that

courts could take to resolving nuisance disputes. We take up
nuisance in greater detail in Chapter IX, but for now, consider these
possibilities and ask

yourself whether any of them may have carried weight with
the court in _Hendricks_ :

( 1 )Instead of balancing the interests of the parties,
perhaps courts should simply ask whether the defendant has committed some kind
of

“invasion” of plaintiff’s land that causes harm above a
certain threshold level (“significant harm”). Richard Epstein has argued that
under the English

common law, a nuisance would be found only if the
defendant’s conduct had caused or threatened to cause some kind of invasion,
such as by air

pollution particles, sewage added to a stream, or sound
waves—a kind of mini-trespass if you will. Richard A. Epstein, Nuisance Law:
Corrective

Justice and Its Utilitarian Constraints, 8 J. Legal Stud. 49
( 1979 ). Is the outcome in the instant case consistent with this principle?
Would Stalnaker’s

well, which would draw water from an aquifer common to both
parcels of land, have caused any “invasion” of the Hendrickses’ subsurface land
rights?

Conversely, would the Hendrickses’ septic tank, which would
diffuse waste water into the surrounding soil, have caused any “invasion” of
Stalnaker’s

subsurface rights?

( 2 )Another possibility would be to decide these disputes
by enforcing the general understanding in the relevant community of what
constitutes

“normal use” of land. See Robert C. Ellickson, Alternatives
to Zoning: Covenants, Nuisance Rules, and Fines as Land Use Controls, 40 U.
Chi. L. Rev.

681 ( 1973 ). Although it is unclear from the facts as
stated, it is likely that both water wells and septic tanks are common uses of
land in rural West

Virginia. Can it be said that either a water well or a
septic tank is more “normal” or “natural” than the other? Water wells have been
around since the

dawn of civilization, whereas septic fields are a more
recent contrivance of human ingenuity. Should this matter?

( 3 )Some cases and commentators have given weight to
temporal priority, in the sense that the first use to be established is given a
presumption of

validity relative to a later, incompatible use. See Donald

```



31



```

Wittman, First Come, First Served: An Economic Analysis of
“Coming to the Nuisance,” 9 J. Legal Stud. 557 ( 1980 ). Note that Stalnaker
rushes to

complete his well before the Hendrickses can obtain a permit
for their septic system. Is this a legitimate reason to prefer Stalnaker’s use
to the

Hendrickses’ use in determining whether the well is a
nuisance? Or is this undesirable behavior? Might it be a legitimate
consideration in other

circumstances?

( 4 )A final approach that may explain some of the cases is
to ask whether the defendant (or the plaintiff) has been acting in a way
consonant with

general norms of “neighborliness.” See Stewart E. Sterk,
Neighbors in American Land Law, 87 Colum. L. Rev. 55 , 88 – 103 ( 1987 ). For
example, many

jurisdictions recognize that the erection of a “spite
fence,” meaning a fence that is built for the sole purpose of irritating a
neighbor, is an actionable

nuisance. Id. at 62 – 63. As between Stalnaker and the
Hendrickses, who is behaving in the more “neighborly” fashion? Is this judgment
too subjective to

serve as the basis for a rule of property law?

Given all these theories or themes in nuisance law competing
with the _Restatement_ ’s balancing test and with each other, can you see why
Prosser

threw up his hands and said it was an “impenetrable jungle?”

4 .Consider again the decision in _Hinman v. Pacific Air
Transport_ in light of _Hendricks_ and the brief summary of nuisance law
provided here.

Does _Hinman_ ultimately subject airplane overflights to a
mode of analysis more commonly associated with nuisance than trespass? See also

Restatement (Second) of Torts § 159 ( 2 ) (Am. L. Inst. 1965
) (“Flight by aircraft in the air space above the land of another is a trespass
if, but only if, (a)

it enters into the immediate reaches of the air space next
to the land, and (b) it interferes substantially with the other’s use and
enjoyment of his land.”).

If there is a subset of trespass cases that should be
resolved using nuisance principles, how could that subset be defined?
Conversely, is there a subset of

nuisance cases that should be handled using a simple and
rigorous doctrine like trespass? If so, how could this subset of nuisance cases
be defined?

5 .Given that intentional trespass is typically clear and
strict, and nuisance is typically neither clear nor strict, the boundary
between interferences

governed by trespass and those governed by nuisance would
seem to be a matter of some importance. In principle, the boundary between
trespass and

nuisance is fixed by the nature of the interests these
actions are said to protect: Trespass is said to protect the interest in
_possession_ of land, while

nuisance is said to protect the _use and enjoyment_ of land.
See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 821 D, cmt. d. From this, it has generally
been assumed

that trespass applies when the defendant intrudes upon the
land with some object large and solid enough to physically displace the
plaintiff from a

portion of her land, such as an intrusion by another person,
a vehicle, standing water—or a mobile home. Conversely, if the invasion is
committed by

small objects like particles of gas or sound or light waves,
this will be governed by the law of nuisance. Similarly, noninvasive
interferences with use

and enjoyment of land, like the construction of a spite
fence, will be

```



32



```

governed by the law of nuisance rather than trespass. (We
take up the distinction between trespass and nuisance further in Chapter IX.)

### 2 .EXCLUSION AND GOVERNANCE

Another way to consider the distinction between trespass and
nuisance is to think of them as exemplifying two different strategies for

resolving disputes about how scarce resources are used:
exclusion and governance. See Henry E. Smith, Exclusion versus Governance: Two

Strategies for Delineating Property Rights, 31 J. Legal
Stud. S453 (2002); Henry E. Smith, Exclusion and Property Rules in the Law of

Nuisance, 90 Va. L. Rev. 965 (2004). Under an exclusion
strategy, decisions about resource use are in a sense delegated to an owner who
acts as

the manager or gatekeeper of the resource. For example, the
owner decides who gets to come onto the property, what it will be used for, and
so

forth. To implement this delegation of gatekeeper authority,
the law allows the owner of the resource to repel any and all intrusions that
do not

have the owner’s consent. A crude signal—whether an object
is intruding on the land or not—is a simple basis for finding a violation.
Exclusion

is likely to be favored where particular resources like land
have multiple potential uses, and when we think it desirable to give owners
discretion

to choose which use is most valuable. The only task of
judges and other officials, under this approach, is to backstop the authority
of the owner

as manager of the resource. In particular, these officials
have no need to monitor—or even to identify—the various permissible uses of the

resource. The law of trespass, at least as applied in Jacque
v. Steenberg Homes , appears to reflect this kind of strategy.

A second and different strategy for solving resource use
disputes is governance. This strategy focuses on particular uses of resources,
and

prescribes particular rules about permitted and prohibited
uses without regard to the other attributes of the resource. Governance rules
can derive

from many sources, including social norms, contracts,
government regulations, and common-law judgments. Governance tends to be used
in

situations where the particular uses of property are of
heightened significance, either because they are strongly favored or
disfavored. Thus, in

Hendricks v. Stalnaker , the parties perceive that their
land can either be used for groundwater extraction or sewage disposal—but quite
likely

cannot be used for both. The answer to the question of which
use has priority will have very substantial implications for the use and
enjoyment of

their respective parcels. Under a governance strategy,
courts or other officials may determine directly how the property will be used
along one or

more dimensions singled out as critical. The law of
nuisance, at least as applied in Hendricks v. Stalnaker , appears to reflect
this kind of strategy.

At various points in these materials we will see property
law shifting from an exclusion strategy to a governance strategy (or somewhere
in

between), particularly as disputes over conflicting uses of
property

#33

become more intense, or more persons are affected by
decisions as to how property is used, or both. The distinction between trespass
and

nuisance is one of the clearest examples of this, and serves
to some extent as a model for similar shifts that occur elsewhere in property
law.

### 3 .THE COASE THEOREM

Nuisance law has given rise to a rich literature about the
role of private agreements—contracts—that reassign property rights in ways

different from how they are originally assigned as a matter
of law. Ronald Coase was an economist who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize

in Economics in 1991 for his identification of the
importance of transaction costs in assessing the economic effects of
alternative institutional

arrangements. His most famous article, part of which is
excerpted below, contains an elaborate discussion of English nuisance cases and
the role

of private agreements in reassigning the rights established
by nuisance law. This is also the article that lays out what has subsequently
come to be

known as the “Coase theorem,” which plays an important role
in the economic analysis of property rights and in law and economics more

generally. Although Coase did not have a law degree, this
article has become the most frequently cited work in all of legal scholarship.

```

This paper is concerned with those actions of business firms
which have harmful effects on others. * * *

The question is commonly thought of as one in which A
inflicts harm on B and what has to be decided is: How should we restrain A? But

this is wrong. We are dealing with a problem of a reciprocal
nature. To avoid the harm to B would inflict harm on A. The real question that
has to

be decided is: Should A be allowed to harm B or should B be
allowed to harm A? The problem is to avoid the more serious harm. I instanced
in

my previous article^1 the case of a confectioner the noise
and vibrations from whose machinery disturbed a doctor in his work. To avoid
harming

the doctor would inflict harm on the confectioner. The
problem posed by this case was essentially whether it was worth while, as a
result of

restricting the methods of production which could be used by
the confectioner, to secure more doctoring at the cost of a reduced supply of

confectionery products. Another example is afforded by the
problem of straying cattle which destroy crops on neighboring land. If it is
inevitable

that some cattle will stray, an increase in the supply of
meat can only be obtained at the expense of a decrease in the supply of crops.
The nature

of the choice is clear: meat or crops. What answer should be
given is, of course, not clear unless we know the value of what is obtained as
well as

the

#34

value of what is sacrificed to obtain it. * * * It goes
almost without saying that this problem has to be looked at in total and at the
margin.

I propose to start my analysis by examining a case in which
most economists would presumably agree that the problem would be solved in a

completely satisfactory manner: when the damaging business
has to pay for all damage caused and the pricing system works smoothly
(strictly

this means that the operation of a pricing system is without
cost).

A good example of the problem under discussion is afforded
by the case of straying cattle which destroy crops growing on neighboring

land. Let us suppose that a farmer and a cattle-raiser are
operating on neighboring properties. Let us further suppose that, without any
fencing

between the properties, an increase in the size of the
cattle-raiser’s herd increases the total damage to the farmer’s crops. What
happens to the

marginal damage as the size of the herd increases is another
matter. This depends on whether the cattle tend to follow one another or to
roam side

by side, on whether they tend to be more or less restless as
the size of the herd increases and on other similar factors. For my immediate
purpose,

it is immaterial what assumption is made about marginal
damage as the size of the herd increases.

To simplify the argument, I propose to use an arithmetical
example. I shall assume that the annual cost of fencing the farmer’s property
is $

and that the price of the crop is $1 per ton. Also, I assume
that the relation between the number of cattle in the herd and the annual crop
loss is as

follows:

Number

in Herd Annual Crop Loss

Crop Loss per Additional

Steer

(Steers) (Tons) (Tons)

1 1 1

2 3 2

3 6 3

4 10 4

Given that the cattle-raiser is liable for the damage
caused, this additional annual cost imposed on the cattle-raiser if he
increased his herd

from, say, 2 to 3 steers is $3 and in deciding on the size
of the herd, he will take this into account along with his other costs. That
is, he will not

increase the size of the herd unless the value of the
additional meat produced (assuming that the cattle-raiser slaughters the
cattle), is greater than

the additional costs that this will entail, including the
value of the additional crops destroyed. Of course, if, by the employment of
dogs,

herdsmen, aeroplanes, mobile radio and other means, the
amount of damage can be reduced, these means will be adopted when their cost is
less

the value of the crop which they prevent being lost. Given
that the

#35

annual cost of fencing is $9, the cattle-raiser who wished
to have a herd with 4 steers or more would pay for fencing to be erected and

maintained, assuming that other means of attaining the same
end would not do so more cheaply. When the fence is erected, the marginal cost
due

to the liability for damage becomes zero, except to the
extent that an increase in the size of the herd necessitates a stronger and
therefore more

expensive fence because more steers are liable to lean
against it at the same time. But, of course, it may be cheaper for the
cattle-raiser not to

fence and to pay for the damaged crops, as in my
arithmetical example, with 3 or fewer steers. * * *

I now turn to the case in which, although the pricing system
is assumed to work smoothly (that is, costlessly), the damaging business is not

liable for any of the damage which it causes. This business
does not have to make a payment to those damaged by its actions. I propose to
show

that the allocation of resources will be the same in this
case as it was when the damaging business was liable for damage caused. * * *

I return to the case of the farmer and the cattle-raiser.
The farmer would suffer increased damage to his crop as the size of the herd

increased. Suppose that the size of the cattle-raiser’s herd
is 3 steers (and that this is the size of the herd that would be maintained if
crop damage

was not taken into account). Then the farmer would be
willing to pay up to $3 if the cattle-raiser would reduce his herd to 2 steers,
up to $5 if the

herd were reduced to 1 steer and would pay up to $6 if
cattle-raising was abandoned. The cattle-raiser would therefore receive $3 from
the farmer

if he kept 2 steers instead of 3. This $3 foregone is
therefore part of the cost incurred in keeping the third steer. Whether the $3
is a payment

which the cattle-raiser has to make if he adds the third
steer to his herd (which it would be if the cattle-raiser was liable to the
farmer for damage

caused to the crop) or whether it is a sum of money which he
would have received if he did not keep a third steer (which it would be if the
cattle-

raiser was not liable to the farmer for damage caused to the
crop) does not affect the final result. In both cases $3 is part of the cost of
adding a

third steer, to be included along with the other costs. If
the increase in the value of production in cattle-raising through increasing
the size of the

herd from 2 to 3 is greater than the additional costs that
have to be incurred (including the $3 damage to crops), the size of the herd
will be

increased. Otherwise, it will not. The size of the herd will
be the same whether the cattle-raiser is liable for the damage caused to the
crop or not.

---

It is necessary to know whether the damaging business is
liable or not for damage caused since without the establishment of this initial

delimitation of rights there can be no market transactions
to transfer and recombine them. But the ultimate result (which maximizes the
value of

production) is independent of the legal position if the
pricing system is assumed to work without cost.

#36

Judges have to decide on legal liability but this should not
confuse economists about the nature of the economic problem involved. In the

case of the cattle and the crops, it is true that there
would be no crop damage without the cattle. It is equally true that there would
be no crop

damage without the crops. The doctor’s work would not have
been disturbed if the confectioner had not worked his machinery; but the

machinery would have disturbed no one if the doctor had not
set up his consulting room in that particular place. * * * If we are to discuss
the

problem in terms of causation, both parties cause the
damage. If we are to attain an optimum allocation of resources, it is therefore
desirable that

both parties should take the harmful effect (the nuisance)
into account in deciding on their course of action. It is one of the beauties
of a smoothly

operating pricing system that, as has already been
explained, the fall in the value of production due to the harmful effect would
be a cost for both

parties. * * *

[I]t has to be remembered that the immediate question faced
by the courts is not what shall be done by whom but who has the legal right to

do what. It is always possible to modify by transactions on
the market the initial legal delimitation of rights. And, of course, if such
market

transactions are costless, such a rearrangement of rights
will always take place if it would lead to an increase in the value of
production.

The argument has proceeded up to this point on the
assumption * * * that there were no costs involved in carrying out market
transactions.

This is, of course, a very unrealistic assumption. In order
to carry out a market transaction it is necessary to discover who it is that
one wishes to

deal with, to inform people that one wishes to deal and on
what terms, to conduct negotiations leading up to a bargain, to draw up the
contract, to

undertake the inspection needed to make sure that the terms
of the contract are being observed, and so on. These operations are often
extremely

costly, sufficiently costly at any rate to prevent many
transactions that would be carried out in a world in which the pricing system
worked

without cost.

In earlier sections, when dealing with the problem of the
rearrangement of legal rights through the market, it was argued that such a

rearrangement would be made through the market whenever this
would lead to an increase in the value of production. But this assumed costless

market transactions. Once the costs of carrying out market
transactions are taken into account it is clear that such a rearrangement of
rights will

only be undertaken when the increase in the value of
production consequent upon the rearrangement is greater than the costs which
would be

involved in bringing it about. When it is less, the granting
of an injunction (or the knowledge that it would be granted) or the liability
to pay

damages may result in an activity being discontinued (or may
prevent its being started) which would be undertaken if market transactions
were

costless. In these conditions the initial delimitation of
legal rights does have an effect on the efficiency with which the economic

#37

system operates. One arrangement of rights may bring about a
greater value of production than any other. But unless this is the arrangement
of

rights established by the legal system, the costs of
reaching the same result by altering and combining rights through the market
may be so great

that this optimal arrangement of rights, and the greater
value of production which it would bring, may never be achieved. * * *

The discussion of the problem of harmful effects in this
section (when the costs of market transactions are taken into account) is
extremely

inadequate. But at least it has made clear that the problem
is one of choosing the appropriate social arrangement for dealing with the
harmful

effects. All solutions have costs and there is no reason to
suppose that government regulation is called for simply because the problem is
not well

handled by the market or the firm. Satisfactory views on
policy can only come from a study of how, in practice, the market, firms and

governments handle the problem of harmful effects.
Economists need to study the work of the broker in bringing parties together,
the effect of

restrictive covenants, the problems of the large-scale
real-estate development company, the operation of Government zoning and other
regulating

activities. It is my belief that economists, and
policy-makers generally, have tended to over-estimate the advantages which come
from

governmental regulation. But this belief, even if justified,
does not do more than suggest that government regulation should be curtailed.
It does

not tell us where the boundary line should be drawn. This,
it seems to me, has to come from a detailed investigation of the actual results
of

handling the problem in different ways. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The problem of cattle trampling crops, which Coase takes
as his central example in the excerpt reproduced here, is usually thought to be

governed by a branch of the law of trespass rather than
nuisance law. Interestingly, however, the rules regarding cattle trespass have
varied in different

parts of the country with respect to who has the duty to put
up a fence to prevent livestock from damaging crops. See Robert C. Ellickson
Order without

Law: How Neighbors Settle Disputes 42 – 43 ( 1991 ). In most
parts of the United States, a “fencing in” rule prevails, whereby the owner of
the cattle or

other livestock has the duty to put up a fence in order to
keep the cattle in. If they escape and trample unfenced crops, the owner of the
cattle is liable for

damages for trespass. In certain parts of the western United
States, however, where grazing livestock on the open range was the historical
practice, a rule

of “fencing out” sometimes prevails, whereby the burden is
on the owner of the crops to put up a fence to keep the cattle out. If the crop
owner has

failed to put up a fence or to keep it maintained, the
cattle owner is not liable when cattle wander into the field and trample the
crops. Does the Coase

theorem provide a basis for explaining why most states would
adopt a fencing in rule, but others a rule of fencing out? See Kenneth R.
Vogel, The Coase

Theorem and California’s Animal Trespass Law, 16 J. Legal
Stud. 149 ( 1987 ). Interestingly, the fencing in/fencing out distinction

```



38



```

only applies to cattle that wander of their own volition
without human guidance. If an owner of livestock deliberately induces his
animals to graze on

land belonging to another, this is regarded as a trespass,
whether the land is open range or not. See Light v. United States, 220 U.S. 523
( 1911 );

Musselshell Cattle Co. v. Woolfolk, 85 P. 874 (Mont. 1906 ).
Also, as Ellickson discovered in his empirical study of modern-day Shasta
County,

California, landowners there follow a norm requiring that
cattle be fenced in, without regard to whether the formal rule on the books
requires fencing in

or fencing out. Ellickson, supra, at 52 – 64. Can all of
this this be explained in terms of the changes in costs and benefits of land
use in the West in recent

decades? (Ellickson notes that many of the areas governed by
fencing-out laws are now populated by small “ranchettes” where people keep some

livestock but also commute to jobs in nearby cities.) Would
you expect norms to be more or less uniform than formal law? In close cases,
would you

expect the norm to be fencing in or fencing out? Which
accords more with general norms of possession? Can the Coase theorem explain
these features

of cattle trespass law and norms that appear to carry
forward the traditional exclusion model? See generally Thomas W. Merrill &
Henry E. Smith,

Making Coasean Property More Coasean, 54 J. L. & Econ. S
77 ( 2011 ).

2 .Work your way carefully through Coase’s example about the
rancher and the farmer, and make sure you understand the logic behind his

argument that if it is costless to enter into contracts
(that is, if “transaction costs” are zero), then the same number of cattle will
be raised by the rancher,

whether or not the rancher is liable to the farmer for
cattle trespass. The basic idea is that if contracting is costless, the parties
will keep contracting to

modify the initial assignment of property rights until they
have exhausted all possible deals that would be to their mutual advantage. The
final stopping

point will always be the use of resources that creates the
greatest joint wealth for the parties, because once this point is reached,
neither party can offer

the other one a deal that would make both of them better
off. Of course, this does not mean that the rancher and the farmer will be
indifferent to the

initial assignment of property rights. If the rancher starts
out with the right to let cattle trespass, then the farmer will have to “bribe”
the rancher to cut

back to the joint-maximizing number. The rancher will be
richer because of the initial assignment of rights. Conversely, if the farmer
starts out with the

right to be free of cattle trespasses, then the rancher will
have to “bribe” the farmer to let him increase the number of cattle. The farmer
will be richer

because of the initial assignment of rights. So you can be
sure that the rancher and the farmer (and others similarly situated) will care
about the

assignment of rights, because it affects the distribution of
wealth. Coase’s point is that if we ignore the distributional impact, and focus
only on the

question of how resources in society are used, the result
would be the same regardless of the initial allocation of rights, provided
transaction costs are

zero. A good text providing further introduction to the
Coase theorem and some basic economics concepts is Richard A. Ippolito,
Economics for

Lawyers 228 – 46 ( 2005 ).

```



3 .What other assumptions are necessary for the invariance
outcome of the Coase theorem to apply? Two assumptions that Coase does not make



```

```

```

explicit are that individuals are rational maximizers and
that all values are capable of being expressed in monetary terms. The
assumption that persons

are rational maximizers means that they prefer more rather
than less (of whatever it is they happen to prefer), and that, subject to
information

constraints, when presented with a choice, they will choose
the option that yields more rather than less. Nearly all economists would
agree, however,

that the assumption that people are rational maximizers is
at most a generalization about human behavior, not a postulate that all people
act rationally in

pursuit of their interests all the time. (Before you have
finished this book, you will have encountered some people who probably cannot
be regarded as

rational maximizers.) How much should the possibility of
irrational behavior concern someone interested in the design of legal
institutions? Most

economists would also agree that there are certain values
that people hold dear that cannot be readily translated into dollar terms. How
much of a

concern should this be to someone designing legal
institutions? Are there still other assumptions about human behavior lurking
behind the Coase

theorem? Robert Cooter has suggested that for the Coase
theorem to hold, one must also assume that people are natural cooperators
rather than ruthless

exploiters. See Robert Cooter, The Cost of Coase, 11 J.
Legal Stud. 1 ( 1982 ) (comparing the Coase Theorem and the “Hobbes Theorem”).
For other

issues, such as whether the parties’ wealth would affect the
allocation of resources in the hypothetical world of zero transaction costs,
see, e.g., R.H.

Coase, The Firm, the Market, and the Law 170 – 74 ( 1988 );
Harold Demsetz, When Does the Rule of Liability Matter?, 1 J. Legal Stud. 13 (
1972 );

Stewart Schwab, Coase Defends Coase: Why Lawyers Listen and
Economists Do Not, 87 Mich. L. Rev. 1171 , 1178 – 84 ( 1989 ).

4 .Coase himself wrote that the assumption that it is
costless to engage in contracts is very unrealistic—“as strange as the physical
world without

friction.” R.H. Coase, The Firm, the Market, and the Law 14
( 1988 ). So the Coase theorem should not be taken to be a guide to
understanding the real

world. Instead, the theorem should be seen as a kind of
thought experiment, which is intended to reveal the importance of transaction
costs in the design

of legal institutions. Coase in later writing expressed
frustration that people mistook his thought experiment to mean that markets
achieve efficient

results when transaction costs are low. “The world of zero
transaction costs has often been described as a Coasian world. Nothing could be
further from

the truth. It is the world of modern economic theory, one
which I was hoping to persuade economists to leave.” Id. at 174. His point was
more nearly the

opposite: that transaction costs are always positive, and
hence we cannot assume that _any_ institutional arrangement will necessarily
generate efficient

results. Coase thought that it is always important to
compare alternative institutional arrangements, and to try to determine which
one will deviate the

least from the unattainable ideal of the (mythical) world of
zero transaction costs. For more about the Coase theorem and its place in legal
scholarship,

see Steven G. Medema, The Coase Theorem at Sixty, 58 J.
Econ. Lit. 1045 ( 2020 ).

```

5 .One of Coase’s controversial claims is that any conflict
over resource use (like the rancher and farmer, or a nuisance dispute) is a
“reciprocal”

one, meaning that each party to the dispute is imposing
costs on the other party. This is plausible if we consider a dispute like
_Hendricks v. Stalnaker_ ,

involving adjacent landowners who make incompatible demands
on the use of the land. But is it equally plausible to say that there is a
“reciprocal”

relationship between a property owner who has an in rem
right to exclude others from her land, and the rest of the world which is
subject to a duty to

desist from interfering with her land? If the rule were that
anyone—not just neighbors—would be entitled to trespass on land, with whom
would the

present owner of the land have to bargain in order to be
free of such trespasses? Everyone on the block? In the United States? The
world? What about

unborn future would-be trespassers? Or do all these cases
just point once again to the importance of transaction costs in the real world?
See Clifford G.

Holderness, The Assignment of Rights, Entry Effects, and the
Allocation of Resources, 18 J. Legal Stud. 181 ( 1989 ). Further, the default
package of

rights the law provides is not as symmetrical with respect
to invasions as one would expect if causation of harm were fully reciprocal;
people have the

right to prevent invasions but robust rights to commit
invasions must usually be specially added to this package. See Henry E. Smith,
Self-Help and the

Nature of Property, 1 J.L. Econ. & Pol’y 69 , 70 – 80 (
2005 ), and Chapter IX.

6 .There is also an enormous literature describing various
attempts to test the Coase theorem empirically. See generally Steven G. Medema
&

Richard O. Zerbe, The Coase Theorem, in The Encyclopedia of
Law and Economics 836 , 858 – 73 ( 2000 ). Although generalizations are
hazardous, much

of this literature suggests that bargaining over
entitlements is influenced not only by joint wealth maximization, but also by a
variety of factors,

including the initial distributions of rights, the history
of interaction between the parties, and perceptions of what outcomes are
regarded as fair.

### 4 .RESOLVING PROPERTY DISPUTES BY CONTRACT

What, you may be asking yourself, is the payoff to the law
student from studying the Coase theorem? One very important lesson is that, as
a

lawyer assisting a client in a dispute over the use of
property, you should always try to imagine various ways in which contracts
might be used to

resolve the problem. Litigation to clarify or enforce
property rights may ultimately be unavoidable. But contractual modifications of
property

rights—“Coasean bargains” as they are sometimes
called—should be explored as an alternative to litigation. A contractual
rearrangement of

rights may be cheaper and more satisfactory to all
concerned.

Consider again in this light the dispute in Hendricks v.
Stalnaker. Nothing in the law would have prevented the parties from bargaining,
at

any stage of the dispute, over the placement of the well and
the septic field. For example, the parties could have agreed to build a well on
one

parcel and a septic field on the other parcel, and could
have granted

#41

reciprocal rights to each other (easements) so that each
would have had access to both facilities. Alternatively, one party could have
bought out

the other, and then built a single well and septic field for
both parcels; they could then have rented half of the land to a tenant (perhaps
the other

party) with water and septic services included in the rent.

Another dimension of Hendricks concerns the role that
land-use regulation plays in creating the dispute. Both Stalnaker and the
Hendrickses

cannot do what they want to do, because the County Health
Department regulation requires that there be at least 100 feet of separation
between

the edge of a septic field and any water well. Perhaps the
Health Department would consider a waiver or modification of this rule if other

adjustments were agreed upon by the parties. For example, if
the Hendrickses agreed to pretreat their waste water before it enters the
septic field,

or if Stalnaker agreed to extra monitoring of his well
water, perhaps the Health Department could be persuaded to relax its 100-foot
buffer zone

requirement. This type of solution would entail a more
complicated set of negotiations among three parties—Stalnaker, the Hendrickses,
and the

Health Department. And of course, the Health Department may
take the position that it has no authority to grant a variance from the rules,
and

even if it has authority, there may be no (lawful) method of
making a side payment to the Department to induce it to be flexible. But a

conscientious lawyer looking for a solution to the problem
would want to explore the regulatory side of the dispute as well.

Why didn’t any of these “Coasean” solutions happen? One
possibility is that the parties (or their lawyers) did not think about these
kinds of

solutions. Another possibility is that they thought about
them, but concluded they were too costly or were technically infeasible. A
third

possibility is that they did not think about them until
transaction costs became too high for any kind of Coasean bargain to take
place. The last

possibility highlights another point taught by the Coase
theorem: It is important to be sensitive to the causes of high transaction
costs in order to

guide clients toward potential Coasean bargains before those
options are foreclosed and litigation is the only recourse.

Many factors, some physical, some psychological, enter into
creating high transaction costs. We will not make any attempt to catalogue

them all here. You will gradually come to have a greater
appreciation of the many impediments to contractual solutions to resource
disputes as

you go through these materials. We will highlight two
factors that loom large throughout property law: assembly problems and
bilateral

monopoly.

Assembly problems arise when someone wants to assemble
property rights from a large number of owners in order to undertake some

project. This is an instance in a property setting of high
transaction costs stemming from large numbers of contracting parties. Hinman is
an

example of an assembly problem. Suppose each surface owner
had the power to block airplanes from entering into the airspace above the
surface

of his or her land, and suppose that some kind of technology
(like

#42

advanced radar) is available so that both surface owners and
airplanes can detect when airplanes enter the column of space above someone’s

land. Under these circumstances, persons who want to fly
would have to assemble permissions from a huge number of surface owners. This

would entail major difficulties in identifying all the
affected surface owners, and getting them to communicate and agree on a
solution. Even if

all the affected surface owners could be identified and
engaged in negotiations, some owners might hold out for a very generous payment
(unless

they could be easily avoided by choosing a different route).
More mundane assembly problems arise when highways or utility lines are built
or

when developers want to acquire multiple contiguous parcels
for some large-scale project (see Figure 1-3). Each of these projects typically

entails the need to assemble a large number of property
rights, and each presents high transaction costs as a consequence.

Another cause of high transaction costs is bilateral
monopoly. By this, we do not refer to large industrial monopolies, but rather
to localized

monopolies—situations in which an owner of property needs
something that can be provided by only one other person or entity. In Hendricks
, it

would appear that the physical lay of the land caused each
party to have only the other as a possible negotiating partner, as long as each
wished to

use the land for wells and/or septic systems. Similarly, in
Jacque , Steenberg Homes had only one route to deliver the mobile home that it

regarded as reasonable, but access to that route was
controlled by the Jacques. Economists call these localized monopoly problems
“bilateral

monopolies,” because there is a monopoly on each side: only
one seller and one buyer for the contested resource. See Richard A. Posner,

Economic Analysis of Law § 3.9 (9th ed. 2014); Stewart E.
Sterk, Neighbors in American Law, 87 Colum. L. Rev. 55, 57–58, 68–88 (1987).

These bilateral monopoly situations are also a source of
high transaction costs, because each of the parties has nowhere else to turn in
order

to engage in an equivalent transaction. Thus, if the parties
disagree about the price or terms for an exchange of resources, prolonged
haggling can

result. Perhaps one or both parties, perceiving that the
other party has no good options, will bargain strategically to try to get an
especially

favorable deal. See Robert Cooter, The Cost of Coase, 11 J.
Legal Stud. 1, 17–24 (1982). Or perhaps one party, the Jacques for example, may
for

whatever reasons be uninterested in entering into any kind
of exchange. A further complication, which seems all too common, is that the
parties

may have gotten off on the wrong foot with each other, which
has led to resentments or “bad blood” that make it very difficult to turn the

relationship into a cooperative one. For whatever reasons,
bilateral monopoly problems are extremely prevalent in property law.

Figure 1-3 A Holdout

By MrTinDC, [http://www.flickr.com,](http://www.flickr.com,)
licensed under CC BY-ND 2.0. This row house on Massachusetts Avenue in
Washington, D.C., was owned by an architect who refused

all entreaties to sell to the developer for many times its
assessed value. The developer eventually decided to build around the house, at
substantial additional expense. The

holdout was reported to be planning to use the house to open
a pizza parlor, which never opened, and the house was later sold for a small
fraction of the developer’s offer.

The lesson for the lawyer advising clients is all too clear
(but all too often ignored): It is important to look down the road in order to
identify

potential assembly problems and bilateral monopoly problems
before the client gets trapped in a situation that precludes any kind of
Coasean

bargaining. If the client wants to acquire six contiguous
parcels of property for a development, and the first five owners agree to sell
but the sixth

holds out, what will happen then? If the client wants to
acquire a home site, but the only means of access for utility lines is across
someone else’s

property, what will happen then? Ideally, someone should
have advised Steenberg Homes about the difficult turn in the private road
before it

agreed to free delivery of the mobile home in the dead of
winter. Ideally, someone should have advised the Hendrickses about the Health

Department regulation requiring a 100-foot buffer zone
around a septic field before they bought their property. Lawyers of course
cannot foresee

all problems, but they should be alert to the kinds of
problems that can arise, and advise their clients to take all appropriate
precautions to be able

to acquire the resources they need before they fall into a
high-transaction-cost trap.

### C. EQUITY AND REMEDIES

Bilateral monopoly situations implicate remedies, especially
those deriving from what were once separate courts of equity. Holdout power

is enhanced when an owner is afforded more than compensatory
damages as a remedy, whether this takes the form of punitive damages or an

injunction, the quintessential equitable remedy.

As explored in more depth in Part C of Chapter IV (“Property
and Equity”), equity has always played a more or less distinct role within the

law, especially in the area of remedies. What the nature of
equity’s contribution to the law—at any given time and over time—forms an
important

theme in property law. To be sure, the courts of law and
equity have long been merged, at least in most jurisdictions, and there are no
longer

separate courses on equity in law schools. Nevertheless, the
body of less formal principles and doctrines developed in equity is still
semi-distinct,

and whether an issue is legal or equitable matters for
purposes such as whether there is a right to a jury (yes at law, no in equity).
“Equitable”

aspects of the law of property are important in their own
right, and it is worthwhile asking whether they possess some distinct character
or serve

a special function.

Equity emerged in England out of the activities of the
Chancellor, a learned royal advisor, one of whose many functions was to
dispense

justice according to the King’s conscience. By the
mid-fourteenth century there emerged a court known as the Court of Chancery.
The Chancellor

heard petitions from persons who were frustrated by the
rigidities or limitations of the common-law courts. The Court of Chancery
differentiated

itself from the common-law courts on a number of dimensions.
The procedures were different: Common-law judges traveled about the country

and certain kinds of cases were tried by juries; courts of
equity sat in London and did not use juries. The style of decision making was
different:

The common-law courts followed a system of pleading in which
the case had to be presented in terms of standardized writs; the Court of

Chancery was willing to consider a wider variety of factors
bearing on the individual justice of the situation presented by the parties.
These

considerations of justice eventually coalesced into a series
of equitable maxims that guided the discretion of the Chancellor, a list of
which gives

their general flavor:

1.Equity follows the law.

2.Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy.

3.Equity acts in personam, not in rem.

4.Equity is equality.

5.Equity regards as done that which ought to be done.

6.Equity regards substance rather than form.

7.She who seeks equity must do equity.

#45

8.He who comes into equity must come with clean hands.

9.Equity aids the vigilant and diligent.

Roger Young & Stephen Spitz, SUEM—Spitz’s Ultimate
Equitable Maxim: In Equity, Good Guys Should Win and Bad Guys Should Lose, 55

S.C. L. Rev. 175, 177 (2003). (For a couple of humorous
takes on the maxims, see Eugene Volokh, Lost Maxims of Equity, 52 J. Legal
Educ. 619

(2002); James Grimmelmann, Koans of Equity, 58 J. Legal
Educ. 472 (2008).) Equity also invented its characteristic defenses, including

“unclean hands” (related to the maxim), which withholds
equity’s aid to anyone who has acted unfairly in the transaction in question;
estoppel,

which prevents a party from taking inconsistent positions
that would unfairly harm someone who has relied on the earlier position; and
laches,

which disallows suit after an unreasonably long time that
would work an injustice (an equitable analog to the statute of limitations).
Notice the

theme of avoiding unfairness and injustice in the maxims and
defenses. All of the defenses will turn up in this book at various points.

The equitable remedies too were different: The common law
offered basically only awards of damages, whereas the Court of Chancery

resolved disputes by issuing mandatory decrees directing
individuals to perform certain acts. As captured in the third maxim above,
these decrees

“operated in personam ; they were binding on the parties in
the cause, but they were not judgments of record binding anyone else and they
did not

alter or contradict the law.” John Baker, An Introduction to
English Legal History 112 (5th ed. 2019). Eventually, even the substantive law
came

to diverge: The Court of Chancery, for example, was
responsible for inventing the trust (studied in Chapter VI) and the equitable
servitude

(studied in Chapter IX), both of which were unknown at
common law. Equity offered a range of remedies, the most important of which is
the

injunction (which is also closely related to specific
performance in contract). An injunction is backed up by the court’s power to
hold a litigant in

contempt.

In America, the distinction between the common-law courts
and courts of equity was never as sharply observed as in England. For example,

in a number of colonies the same judges who sat as a court
of common law would periodically sit as the court of equity. Lawrence M.
Friedman,

A History of American Law 47 (1973). Not all colonies were
enthusiastic about equity, or at least about separate equity courts, associated
as they

were with royal prerogative. During the nineteenth century,
equity procedures started to converge with those of the common-law courts, even

while the two courts, or modes of sitting as courts, were
still kept distinct. Stanley N. Katz, The Politics of Law in Colonial America:

Controversies over Chancery Courts and Equity Law in the
Eighteenth Century, in 5 Perspectives in American History: Law in American
History

259 (Donald Fleming & Bernard Bailyn eds., 1971); Amalia
D. Kessler, Our Inquisitorial Tradition: Equity, Procedure, Due Process, and
the

Search for an Alternative to the Adversarial, 90 Cornell

#46

L. Rev. 1181 (2005). Starting in 1848, with the adoption of
the Field Code in New York, many states formally abolished the distinction,
declaring

a “merger” of law and equity. In other states the
distinction persisted, with some states preserving within a unitary judicial
system a “law

division” and an “equity division,” and a few states, most
prominently perhaps Delaware, preserving a separate “Court of Chancery.” The
fusion

of law and equity in federal courts occurred in stages,
culminating in the unitary system of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in
1938. England

formally abolished the distinction between law and equity
courts in the Judicature Act of 1 873. See Kellen Funk, The Union of Law and
Equity:

The United States, 1800–1938, in Equity and Law: Fusion and
Fission 46 (John C.P. Goldberg, Henry E. Smith & P.G. Turner eds., 2019);

Patricia I. McMahon, Field, Fusion and the 1850s: How an
American Law Reformer Influenced the Judicature Act of 1875, in Equity and

Administration 424, 424–25 (P.G. Turner ed., 2016).

Notwithstanding the formal elimination (in most places) of
the two court systems, the different procedural, intellectual, and substantive

traditions associated with the two systems continue to be
important, especially in the law of property. Henry E. Smith, Equity as
Meta-Law, 130

Yale L.J. 1050 (2021). In fact, one of the traditional
maxims of equity is that property rights enjoy special protection in a court of
equity. This

maxim is reflected in the law in a number of ways, such as
in the understanding that a court of equity will generally grant specific
performance to

enforce a contract for the sale of real property, even
though a breach of contract ordinarily results only in an award of damages. In
general,

however, if a plaintiff seeks an order compelling the
defendant to perform a particular act—such as keeping off the plaintiff’s land,
or abating a

nuisance that affects the plaintiff’s land, or specifically
performing a contract the defendant has entered into with respect to the
land—then the

plaintiff must satisfy the various traditional requirements
associated with equity in order to obtain such relief. These come into play in
the

following case.

#### Pardee v. Camden Lumber Co.

```



Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, 1911.



73 SE. 82.



```

■
POFFENBARGER, J. [The plaintiff sought an injunction barring the defendant from
cutting down trees on what the plaintiff claimed was his land.

The lower court dissolved the injunction on the authority of
McMillan v. Ferrell , 7 W. Va. 223 (1874), which held that the only remedy for
a

trespass that results in cutting down trees is an action for
damages, unless the defendant is insolvent or some other circumstance precludes

recovery of monetary compensation. Noting that the McMillan
decision “seems not to have commanded uniform approval by the public, nor by

the members of the legal profession,” the West Virginia
Supreme Court agreed to consider whether the 1874 decision should be
overruled.] * * *

#47

Under these circumstances, we feel it our duty to re–examine
the proposition [adopted in McMillan ] and thoroughly test its soundness by

the application of legal and equitable principles. The chief
restraint or limitation upon the overruling of decisions is the inexpediency
and

injustice of disturbing property rights. Hence it has been
said that a line of decisions enunciating a principle which has become a rule
of property,

or under which property rights have vested by reason of its
observance and adoption in contracts, will not be overruled. Here there is no
such

limitation. To abolish the rule or principle under
consideration neither destroys nor impairs any property right or incident. On
the contrary, the

abolition thereof will conserve and protect such rights and
incidents, for no man can be said to have a property right in that which
amounts to a

trespass against his neighbor or a stranger. The effect will
be to give the admitted and acknowledged property owner a more complete remedy
for

the vindication of his property rights. We regard the rule
as one pertaining to remedy only as regards the trespasser who is the sole
beneficiary

thereof. Hence, if the application of the test above
mentioned shall disclose its unsoundness, we shall feel entirely free to
abrogate it. Having

created or ordained it, this court may consistently discard
it, without injury to any person and to the great relief of property owners.

Supposed adequacy of the legal remedy for the cutting of
timber, regarded as a mere trespass upon land, constitutes the basis of the
rule. If

the legal remedy is not adequate, the whole doctrine
necessarily fails. Whether it is must be determined by reference to the general
policy of the

law as disclosed by its application in analogous and related
cases. In other words, we must see to what extent the remedies afforded by
courts of

law and equity protect and vindicate the right of an owner
of property to keep it in such condition as he desires. If we find the general
object to

be the maintenance of this right, respecting all other kinds
of property, we must necessarily say it ought to extend to the right of an
owner of

timber to allow it to stand upon his land in its natural
state as long as he desires it to do so. Timber cut down and converted into
mere logs and

lumber is plainly not the same thing as standing timber. It
is equally manifest that the legal remedies are wholly inadequate to reconvert
logs and

lumber into live, standing, growing trees. Our rule permits
a mere trespasser to utterly destroy the forest of his neighbor, provided he is
solvent

and able to respond in damages to the extent of the value
thereof. It can neither restore the forest, nor prevent its destruction. It
allows the

property to be wholly altered in nature and character, or
converts it into a mere claim for damages. After the timber has been cut, the
owner may

recover possession thereof by an action of detinue, or,
waiving that, may recover its value, but this does not in either case restore
the property to

its former state, nor replace it by the return of an
equivalent. The general principles of English and American jurisprudence forbid
such a result.

They guarantee to the owner of property the right, not only
to possession thereof and dominion over it, but also its immunity from injury,
unless

it be of such character that it may be substantially
replaced. On the theory

#48

of adequacy of the legal remedy an injunction to prevent the
sale or destruction of certain kinds of personal property will be refused, but
the

principles upon which this conclusion stand cannot be
extended to all forms of property either real or personal, and the courts do
not attempt so

to extend it. Compensation in damages is adequate in all
those instances in which the property is injured or destroyed may be
substantially

replaced with the money recovered as its value. For
instance, the world is full of horses, cattle, sheep, hogs, lumber, and many
other articles.

Ordinarily, one of these may be replaced by another just as
good. This principle is applied in a proceeding for specific performance of
contracts

for the sale of corporate stocks. If the stock belongs to a
class found generally in the market for sale, equity refuses specific
performance of the

contract, because other stock of the same kind can be
purchased with the money recovered as damages. If, on the other hand, the stock
is limited

and unobtainable in the market, specific performance will be
enforced. Similarly, as no two pieces of land can be regarded as equivalent in
value

and character in all respects, equity will always enforce
specific performance of a valid contract for the sale thereof. If personal
property

possesses a value peculiar to its owner, or, as it is
generally expressed, has a pretium affectionis, equity will vindicate and
uphold the right to the

possession thereof and immunity from injury by the exercise
of its extraordinary powers. We observe, also, that the law gives a remedy for
the

possession of personal property, however trivial its value
or character may be. It does not limit the owner to a claim for damage, unless
the

property has gone beyond the reach of its process. As equity
follows the law, and, as far as possible, supplies omissions therein, so far as
may be

necessary to the effectuation of substantial justice, it
vindicates the right of an owner to enjoy his property without injury or
molestation by the

exercise of its preventive powers; but, harmonizing with the
great divine rule of help to those who help themselves, equity goes no further
than is

necessary. Therefore, if a man threatens to take away or
kill his neighbor’s horse, a court of equity will not interfere by injunction,
because the

owner may recover the value of that horse and buy another in
the general market of substantially the same kind or value. For the same
reason, it

refuses to enforce specific performance of a contract of
sale of a horse. But, if a man is about to destroy his neighbor’s heirlooms,
things having a

peculiar value and insusceptible of replacement by purchase
in the market, the legal remedy is not adequate, and a court of equity will,
therefore,

protect the possession and title of the owner by the
exercise of its extraordinary powers. * * * In all these cases, the remedy by
law is inadequate,

because it does not enforce the right of the injured party
to the full extent thereof. Such being the general policy of the law, do we not
violate it

by denying to the owner of standing timber his clear and
indisputable legal right to have it remain upon his land until such time as he
shall see fit

to convert it into a different kind of property? Moreover,
standing timber is everywhere regarded as part of the real estate upon which it
grows.

The cutting

#49

thereof converts it into personal property, and wholly
changes its legal nature and incidents. Being a part of the land itself, it has
no legal

equivalent in nature or value, for no two pieces of land are
alike in all respects, nor is a piece of land, stripped of its timber, with a
right of action

for the felled timber or for damages, the equivalent of the
same land with the timber on it. Courts universally hold that all contracts
relating to

real estate are subjects of equitable cognizance, because
they relate to real estate. * * * Of course, the legal remedy is adequate, if
the trespass

amounts to nothing more than the trampling of the grass or
throwing down of the fences, acts in no way affecting the substance of the
estate, but

the adequacy of the remedy in such cases does not argue
efficacy in those cases in which part of the real estate is actually severed
and carried

away, to the injury and detriment of the inheritance.

Upon the principles and considerations here stated, we are
of the opinion that the adoption of this rule was a deviation from fundamental

principles of our jurisprudence. It is no doubt attributable
to a lack of appreciation of the true character of timber, due to its former
abundance

and comparative worthlessness. In early days it was regarded
as an incumbrance and burden upon lands. Having nothing but forests, the chief

object or purpose of landowners everywhere was to get rid of
the forests, and prepare their lands for agriculture. There was an abundance of

timber, and no market for it. The soil was untillable
because of the timber. Hence it was a common practice for owners to cut down
the finest of

timber, faultless oak, poplar, pine, walnut, and hickory,
and burn it upon the premises in log heaps, upon the theory of a disposition of
an

incumbrance and obstacle to the growth and development of
agriculture as a pursuit. Anybody who desired to cut a tree on his neighbor’s
land in

the pursuit of wild animals or the search for deposits of
honey had a tacit permission to do so. Forest fires were not regarded as evils,
unless they

happened to destroy fences, buildings, or other improvements
or agricultural implements or products. Timber was not regarded as anything
more

than an ordinary commercial article, and almost worthless
because of its abundance. The prevalence of this estimate of its character was
naturally

calculated subtly to influence the minds of the judiciary,
for the judges were men then, as they now are and always have been, mingling
with the

populace, and insensibly and unconsciously absorbing, to a
greater or less extent, the prevailing sentiment of the people. The error, thus
born, has

been revealed by the great change of conditions. Timber
having become scarce and of great value, the layman, lawyer, and judge has in
recent

years given the subject more careful, critical, and profound
consideration, with the result that the error is practically admitted
everywhere.

Violative of principle, as we think, the rule is also
contrary to the great weight of authority. In the general struggle for relief
from it, courts

have in some instances based distinctions upon the relative
values of the timber and the land, saying the cutting of timber, constituting
the chief

#50

value of the land, will be enjoined, but we think a clear
case of trespass by the cutting of timber should always be enjoined. In one
sense a small

quantity of timber on land is more indispensable to its
enjoyment than a large quantity. * * *

For the reasons here stated, the decree complained of will
be reversed, the injunction reinstated, and the cause remanded.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The threshold question for injunctions, as it is in
equity generally, is whether the legal remedy is adequate. If law—usually
damages—will do,

then equity has no role to play. It is only where injury (or
sometimes threatened injury) is irreparable, through damages, that a court will
even consider

an injunction. For example, this hurdle can be overcome by
showing that the harm is not susceptible of measurement (e.g. subjective value)
or

replacement. These considerations sound so broad that some
have questioned whether inadequacy of the legal remedy is really much of an
obstacle to

injunctions at all. See Douglas Laycock, The Death of the
Irreparable Injury Rule ( 1991 ); but see Samuel L. Bray, The System of
Equitable Remedies,

63 UCLA L. Rev. 530 , 533 ( 2016 ); Smith, Equity as
Meta-Law, supra, Yale L.J. at 2021. Damages can also be inadequate if the
invasion is repeated or

continuing, which would require a multiplicity of suits—an
unfair burden on the potential plaintiff. We will encounter such a situation in
_Baker v.

Howard County Hunt_ , excerpted in Chapter IV.

2 .Injunctions are sometimes considered “supracompensatory
remedies,” in that they can afford a plaintiff more than damages, especially
those

pegged at market prices. And they can certainly burden
defendants more than the requirement to pay a damages award. They are sometimes
identified

with “property rules” as opposed to liability rules,” in the
framework of Guido Calabresi and A. Douglas Melamed, which we take up in
Chapter IX.

This stringency of injunctions is often genuine, but
injunctions are more targeted and can be softened or delayed to give the
defendant time to comply.

Perhaps it is more apt to call an injunction “specific
relief,” aimed at giving right holders the very thing to which they are
entitled. However, as we will

see in later chapters, some traditional legal causes of
action result in specific relief. Notably ejectment is the action to recover
possession of land, and

replevin is used to force a wrongful possessor to hand over
an item of personal property (Chapter IV).

3 .Corresponding to its potentially severe impact and the
need for careful crafting and sometimes on-going supervision, the injunction is
a

discretionary remedy administered by judges, not juries.
This discretion is not unbounded but subject to a variety of presumptions and
rules of thumb, as

well as more formal defenses, such as unclean hands and
disproportionate hardship. (We will see the latter at work in the building
encroachment cases in

Chapter IV.) How should a judge decide whether an item of
personal property or even an aspect of land is so subjectively important or
irreplaceable that

an injunction is appropriate? Are judges’ notions of what

```



51



```

constitutes an “heirloom” or is associated with a “pretium
affectionis” likely to be too narrow or elitist? What do you think of Judge
Poffenbarger’s tour

through the history of attitudes towards trees in West
Virginia? Given the court’s recognition that social values about property
change over time, do you

agree with the judge’s confident claim that a threat “to
take away or kill” a neighbor’s horse would not warrant an injunction if such a
case arose today?

Are the problems here more severe than in contracts, where
the related remedy of specific performance is reserved for certain kinds of
contracts—

including those for the sale of land? For that matter, is
land always unique or special?

4 .Given the analysis of the irreparable injury principle in
_Pardee_ , would the Jacques be entitled to an injunction against Steenberg
Homes if they

could somehow get to court before the delivery of the mobile
home took place? In what sense is there any irreparable harm to the Jacques’
land from

scooping a path through the snow with a bobcat? Or does the
_Jacque_ decision, awarding $ 100 , 000 in punitive damages for an intentional
trespass, rest

on a different principle about property than the one
recognized in _Pardee_?

5 .Much of the opinion in _Pardee_ focuses on whether to
overrule a long line of cases denying injunctions against threatened
tree-cutting. The issue

of stare decisis is one that you will encounter in all your
courses, and it has special resonance in property (Chapter X). How reluctant
should judges be to

overturn a precedent? What if people have arranged their
affairs in reliance on the old but undesirable precedent? It seems a stretch to
say that anyone

relied significantly on the no-injunction rule of _McMillan
v. Ferrell_. Was that case understandable at the time and became an
embarrassment when social

values changed, or was it wrong on the day it was decided?
Equity courts originally did not adhere to stare decisis, but became more like
law courts in

this regard long before the merger of law and equity. Is
there something special about equitable relief that resists formulation as
rules backed up by full-

blown stare decisis?

## CHAPTER II

# ACQUISITION AND CLAIM SCOPE

Where does property come from? The earliest and most
widespread kind of property is the general respect for possession that arose
before

historical records were kept—and that children learn early
in their lives. As we will see “possession” has a variety of meanings, from the
factual

possession of someone in control of a resource, to legal
possession and rights to possess, and even the possessory rights of an owner.
Indeed,

among the ways that ownership can get started is for someone
to possess a thing for the first time with the requisite intent. What kinds of
events

qualify as establishing a root of title, from which a
sequence of voluntary conveyances can then unfold? Roots of title can be
started in a variety

of ways. Other modes of original acquisition include
discovery, creation, and accession. Accession involves an owner of one resource
being able

to claim ownership of a related subordinate resource—as
where the owner of a tree owns its fruits. Possession and accession often work
in

tandem to establish the scope of a property claim. We also
examine problems that arise when one or more involuntary acquisition events
occur,

and when different principles of establishing original
acquisition come into conflict.

### A. FIRST POSSESSION

Most of the property you own was probably acquired from
someone else, by purchase or gift. The person from whom you acquired it

probably got it from someone else, also by purchase or gift.
That person, in turn, got it from someone else, and so on. But how do these
chains of

ownership get started? What kinds of events qualify as
establishing a root of title, from which a sequence of voluntary conveyances
can then

unfold? In this Part we consider various modes of original
acquisition—ways in which ownership can be established other than through

voluntary conveyance from a previous owner.

Perhaps the most familiar principle for establishing a new
root of title is simply being the first to possess something that is unclaimed
by

anyone else. “First in time” is deceptively simple, but what
does it mean to “possess” something? What sorts of resources can be said to be

“unclaimed” by anyone else? From where do we derive
standards for resolving these sorts of issues?

### 1 .WILD ANIMALS

#### Pierson v. Post

```



Supreme Court of New York, 1805.



3 Cai. R. 175 , 2 Am. Dec. 264.



```

This was an action of trespass on the case commenced in a
justice’s court, by the present defendant against the now plaintiff.

The declaration stated that Post , being in possession of
certain dogs and hounds under his command, did, “upon a certain wild and

uninhabited, unpossessed and waste land, called the beach,
find and start one of those noxious beasts called a fox,” and whilst there
hunting,

chasing and pursuing the same with his dogs and hounds, and
when in view thereof, Pierson, well knowing the fox was so hunted and pursued,

did, in the sight of Post, to prevent his catching the same,
kill and carry it off. A verdict having been rendered for the plaintiff below,
the

defendant there sued out a certiorari, and now assigned for
error, that the declaration and the matters therein contained were not
sufficient in law

to maintain an action. * * *

■
TOMPKINS, J. delivered the opinion of the court. This cause comes before us on
a return to a certiorari directed to one of the justices of Queens

county.

The question submitted by the counsel in this cause for our
determination is, whether Lodowick Post, by the pursuit with his hounds in the

manner alleged in his declaration, acquired such a right to,
or property in, the fox, as will sustain an action against Pierson for killing
and taking

him away?

The cause was argued with much ability by the counsel on
both sides, and presents for our decision a novel and nice question. It is
admitted

that a fox is an animal ferae naturae, * and that property
in such animals is acquired by occupancy only. These admissions narrow the
discussion

to the simple question of what acts amount to occupancy,
applied to acquiring right to wild animals?

If we have recourse to the ancient writers upon general
principles of law, the judgment below is obviously erroneous. Justinian’s
Institutes,

lib. 2. tit. 1. s. 13. and Fleta, lib. 3. c. 2. p. 175.
adopt the principle, that pursuit alone vests no property or right in the
huntsman; and that even

pursuit, accompanied with wounding, is equally ineffectual
for that purpose, unless the animal be actually taken. The same principle is

recognised by Bracton, lib. 2. c. 1. p. 8.

Puffendorf, lib. 4. c. 6. s. 2. and 10. defines occupancy of
beasts ferae naturae, to be the actual corporal possession of them, and

Bynkershoek is cited as coinciding in this definition. It is
indeed with hesitation that

#55

Puffendorf affirms that a wild beast mortally wounded, or
greatly maimed, cannot be fairly intercepted by another, whilst the pursuit of
the

person inflicting the wound continues. The foregoing
authorities are decisive to show that mere pursuit gave Post no legal right to
the fox, but

that he became the property of Pierson, who intercepted and
killed him.

It therefore only remains to inquire whether there are any
contrary principles, or authorities, to be found in other books, which ought to

induce a different decision. Most of the cases which have
occurred in England, relating to property in wild animals, have either been
discussed

and decided upon the principles of their positive statute
regulations, or have arisen between the huntsman and the owner of the land upon
which

beasts ferae naturae have been apprehended; the former
claiming them by title of occupancy, and the latter ratione soli. ** Little
satisfactory aid

can, therefore, be derived from the English reporters.

Barbeyrac, in his notes on Puffendorf, does not accede to
the definition of occupancy by the latter, but, on the contrary, affirms, that
actual

bodily seizure is not, in all cases, necessary to constitute
possession of wild animals. He does not, however, describe the acts which,
according to

his ideas, will amount to an appropriation of such animals
to private use, so as to exclude the claims of all other persons, by title of
occupancy, to

the same animals; and he is far from averring that pursuit
alone is sufficient for that purpose. To a certain extent, and as far as
Barbeyrac appears

to me to go, his objections to Puffendorf’s definition of
occupancy are reasonable and correct. That is to say, that actual bodily
seizure is not

indispensable to acquire right to, or possession of, wild
beasts; but that, on the contrary, the mortal wounding of such beasts, by one
not

abandoning his pursuit, may, with the utmost propriety, be
deemed possession of him; since, thereby, the pursuer manifests an unequivocal

intention of appropriating the animal to his individual use,
has deprived him of his natural liberty, and brought him within his certain
control. So

also, encompassing and securing such animals with nets and
toils, or otherwise intercepting them in such a manner as to deprive them of
their

natural liberty, and render escape impossible, may justly be
deemed to give possession of them to those persons who, by their industry and

labour, have used such means of apprehending them. Barbeyrac
seems to have adopted, and had in view in his notes, the more accurate opinion

of Grotius, with respect to occupancy [requiring more than
wounding but allowing possession by instruments such as nets]. * * * The case
now

under consideration is one of mere pursuit, and presents no
circumstances or acts which can bring it within the definition of occupancy by

Puffendorf, or Grotius, or the ideas of Barbeyrac upon that
subject.

The case cited from 11 Mod. 74–130 [ Keeble v. Hickeringill
], I think clearly distinguishable from the present; inasmuch as there the
action

#56

was for maliciously hindering and disturbing the plaintiff
in the exercise and enjoyment of a private franchise; and in the report of the
same case,

3 Salk. 9 Holt, Ch. J. states, that the ducks were in the
plaintiff’s decoy pond, and so in his possession, from which it is obvious the
court laid

much stress in their opinion upon the plaintiff’s possession
of the ducks, ratione soli.

We are the more readily inclined to confine possession or
occupancy of beasts ferae naturae, within the limits prescribed by the learned

authors above cited, for the sake of certainty, and
preserving peace and order in society. If the first seeing, starting, or
pursuing such animals,

without having so wounded, circumvented or ensnared them, so
as to deprive them of their natural liberty, and subject them to the control of
their

pursuer, should afford the basis of actions against others
for intercepting and killing them, it would prove a fertile source of quarrels
and

litigation.

However uncourteous or unkind the conduct of Pierson towards
Post, in this instance, may have been, yet his act was productive of no

injury or damage for which a legal remedy can be applied. We
are of opinion the judgment below was erroneous, and ought to be reversed.

■
LIVINGSTON, J. My opinion differs from that of the court. Of six exceptions,
taken to the proceedings below, all are abandoned except the third,

which reduces the controversy to a single question.

Whether a person who, with his own hounds, starts and hunts
a fox on waste and uninhabited ground, and is on the point of seizing his prey,

acquires such an interest in the animal, as to have a right
of action against another, who in view of the huntsman and his dogs in full
pursuit, and

with knowledge of the chase, shall kill and carry him away?

This is a knotty point, and should have been submitted to
the arbitration of sportsmen, without poring over Justinian, Fleta, Bracton,

Puffendorf, Locke, Barbeyrac, or Blackstone, all of whom
have been cited; they would have had no difficulty in coming to a prompt and
correct

conclusion. In a court thus constituted, the skin and
carcass of poor reynard would have been properly disposed of, and a precedent
set,

interfering with no usage or custom which the experience of
ages has sanctioned, and which must be so well known to every votary of Diana.

But the parties have referred the question to our judgment,
and we must dispose of it as well as we can, from the partial lights we
possess,

leaving to a higher tribunal, the correction of any mistake
which we may be so unfortunate as to make. By the pleadings it is admitted that
a fox

is a “wild and noxious beast.” Both parties have regarded
him, as the law of nations does a pirate, “ hostem humani generis, ” * and
although “ de

mortuis nil nisi bonum, ” ** be a maxim of our profession,
the memory of the deceased has not been spared. His depredations on farmers and
on

#57

barn yards, have not been forgotten; and to put him to death
wherever found, is allowed to be meritorious, and of public benefit. Hence it

follows, that our decision should have in view the greatest
possible encouragement to the destruction of an animal, so cunning and ruthless
in his

career. But who would keep a pack of hounds; or what
gentleman, at the sound of the horn, and at peep of day, would mount his steed,
and for

hours together, “ sub jove frigido, ” or a vertical sun,
pursue the windings of this wily quadruped, if, just as night came on, and his
stratagems and

strength were nearly exhausted, a saucy intruder, who had
not shared in the honours or labours of the chase, were permitted to come in at
the

death, and bear away in triumph the object of pursuit?
Whatever Justinian may have thought of the matter, it must be recollected that
his code

was compiled many hundred years ago, and it would be very
hard indeed, at the distance of so many centuries, not to have a right to
establish a

rule for ourselves. In his day, we read of no order of men
who made it a business, in the language of the declaration in this cause, “with
hounds

and dogs to find, start, pursue, hunt, and chase,” these
animals, and that, too, without any other motive than the preservation of Roman
poultry; if

this diversion had been then in fashion, the lawyers who
composed his institutes, would have taken care not to pass it by, without
suitable

encouragement. If any thing, therefore, in the digests or
pandects shall appear to militate against the defendant in error, who, on this
occasion,

was the foxhunter, we have only to say tempora mutantur ;
*** and if men themselves change with the times, why should not laws also
undergo an

alteration?

It may be expected, however, by the learned counsel, that
more particular notice be taken of their authorities. I have examined them all,
and

feel great difficulty in determining, whether to acquire
dominion over a thing, before in common, it be sufficient that we barely see
it, or know

where it is, or wish for it, or make a declaration of our
will respecting it; or whether, in the case of wild beasts, setting a trap, or
lying in wait, or

starting, or pursuing, be enough; or if an actual wounding,
or killing, or bodily tact and occupation be necessary. Writers on general law,
who

have favoured us with their speculations on these points,
differ on them all; but, great as is the diversity of sentiment among them,
some

conclusion must be adopted on the question immediately
before us. After mature deliberation, I embrace that of Barbeyrac, as the most
rational,

and least liable to objection. If at liberty, we might
imitate the courtesy of a certain emperor, who, to avoid giving offence to the
advocates of any

of these different doctrines, adopted a middle course, and
by ingenious distinctions, rendered it difficult to say (as often happens after
a fierce and

angry contest) to whom the palm of victory belonged. He
ordained, that if a beast be followed with large dogs and hounds , he shall
belong to the

hunter, not to the chance occupant; and in like manner, if
he be killed or wounded with a lance or sword; but

#58

if chased with beagles only , then he passed to the captor,
not to the first pursuer. If slain with a dart, a sling, or a bow, he fell to
the hunter, if still

in chase, and not to him who might afterwards find and seize
him.

Now, as we are without any municipal regulations of our own,
and the pursuit here, for aught that appears on the case, being with dogs and

hounds of imperial stature, we are at liberty to adopt one
of the provisions just cited, which comports also with the learned conclusion
of

Barbeyrac, that property in animals ferae naturae may be
acquired without bodily touch or manucaption, provided the pursuer be within
reach, or

have a reasonable prospect (which certainly existed here) of
taking, what he has thus discovered an intention of converting to his own use.

When we reflect also that the interest of our husbandmen,
the most useful of men in any community, will be advanced by the destruction of

a beast so pernicious and incorrigible, we cannot greatly
err, in saying, that a pursuit like the present, through waste and unoccupied
lands, and

which must inevitably and speedily have terminated in
corporal possession, or bodily seisin, confers such a right to the object of
it, as to make

any one a wrongdoer, who shall interfere and shoulder the
spoil. The justice’s judgment ought, therefore, in my opinion, to be affirmed.

Judgment of reversal.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1. _Pierson v. Post_ is probably the most famous case in
   property law, but until recently little was known about Jesse Pierson and
   Lodowick Post, or

the background to their dispute over the fox. A recent
outpouring of scholarship has now recently added significantly to our knowledge
about the case.

The episode on which the case is based occurred near
Southampton, in eastern Long Island, not in Queens, where it was tried (perhaps
for the

convenience of the attorneys). According to Bethany Berger,
Jesse Pierson, the defendant, was a schoolmaster who was descended from one of
the

families that founded Southampton. His father, David
Pierson, was a farmer and a pillar of the community. As a “proprietor” of the
town, David claimed

special privileges in the areas treated as commons where the
episode with the fox presumably took place. Lodowick Post, the plaintiff who
organized the

fox hunting party, was the son of Nathan Post, who had made
large amounts of money as a privateer in the Revolutionary War and later
through

commercial ventures following the war. Although poorly
educated, Nathan purchased a large home in the center of town, flaunted his
wealth in various

ways (including, presumably, by supporting fox hunting
parties), and contested the rights of the proprietors to their special
privileges in the use of the

commons. Berger plausibly concludes that the litigation
reflected a clash between a traditional elite and new wealth: Both sides
perceived in the actions

of the other a fundamental challenge to different visions of
how the community should be organized and controlled. See Bethany R. Berger,
It’s Not

About the Fox: The Untold History of _Pierson v. Post,_ 55
Duke L.J. 1089 ( 2006 ).

Andrea McDowell focuses on the customs associated with fox
hunting. We learn from her study that organized fox hunting with hounds was a

social activity, not an efficient means of destroying foxes
as predators. If one wanted to exterminate foxes in a cost-effective manner,
trapping was the

way to go. One of the conventions of organized fox hunting
was that the fox should be killed by the hounds. This was to give the hounds a
“taste of

blood,” which would make them more eager to chase down foxes
in the future. So it is unlikely that Post had any expectation of capturing the
fox as a

trophy or obtaining any value from the fox pelt (which would
be worth only a few dollars in any event). In England the principle of _ratione
soli_ (referred

to in passing by Justice Tompkins in his majority opinion)
applied only to animals hunted as game, such as deer and rabbits, not to
predators like foxes.

This principle of _ratione soli_ conferred an exclusive
privilege on the owner of land to hunt, or to license others to hunt game on
his land. However, until

1809 , foxes and other beasts of prey were regarded as
“outlaws” and could be pursued by any person even on private land owned by
another. In _Essex v.

Capel_ ( 1809 ) (reported in: An account of the trial
between George Earl of Essex, plaintiff, and the Hon. & Rev. Wm. Capel,
defendant... at the

Summer Assizes holden at Hertford, July 20 th, 1809 (London,
Luke Hansard & Sons 1810 )), this privilege was overturned, and the court
held that a

landowner could exclude a foxhunting party, although local
mores operated to permit foxhunting on private property for many years
afterwards. See

Andrea McDowell, Legal Fictions in _Pierson v. Post,_ 105
Mich. L. Rev. 735 , 753 ( 2007 ).

From the recent discovery by Angela Fernandez of the
long-misplaced trial record in _Pierson_ , it appears that there were numerous
grounds for

reversing the trial court, but both Tompkins’s opinion and
Livingston’s dissent focused on the rule of capture. Angela Fernandez, The Lost
Record of

_Pierson v. Post_ , the Famous Fox Case, 27 L. & Hist.
Rev. 149 ( 2009 ). Her informed speculation is that Chief Justice James Kent
set the problem as a

sort of homework assignment for the other judges, leading to
the dutiful (and uncharacteristic) citations to foreign treatises in Tomkins’s
majority

opinion and the tone of defiant mockery in the Livingston
dissent. Angela Fernandez, _Pierson v. Post_ : The Hunt for the Fox 45 – 140 (
2018 ). Much other

lore has built up around the case, much of it rather
dubious. See Daniel R. Ernst, _Pierson v. Post_ : The New Learning, 13 Green
Bag ( 2 d ser.) 31 ( 2009 ).

2. _Pierson_ was decided shortly after the American
   Revolution, and the court declines to follow English regulations and doctrines
   on capture of

wild animals. Not surprisingly, there were no prominent
American precedents on point. Faced with a dearth of authority, the judges
turned to legal

treatises for an answer to the question of who had a better
claim to the fox. The treatises cited cover a vast range of time and space.
Justinian’s _Institutes_

is a synthesis of Roman law compiled during the reign of the
Emperor Justinian in the sixth century A.D. Bracton and Fleta were English
legal writers of

the thirteenth century. Grotius, Pufendorf, Bijnkershoek,
and Barbeyrac were legal writers from the continent of Europe writing in the
seventeenth and

eighteenth centuries. Blackstone wrote his influential
_Commentaries on the Laws of England_ in the eighteenth century. What

```

```

assumption about the nature of property rights are the
judges making when they consult these types of sources and implicitly give them
equal weight in

their quest to determine who has the better claim to the
fox? When Justice Livingston’s dissent suggests, perhaps semi-facetiously, that
the dispute

should have been submitted to “the arbitration of
sportsmen,” is he making a different assumption about the nature of property
rights? Which premise

strikes you as better? By what criteria should we decide
which premise is better?

3 .This is a suit between just two individuals, but the
outcome will determine who owns the dead fox. If property rights are good
against “all the

world,” or create duties of noninterference in all persons
in the relevant legal community, how can such rights be established in a suit
between A and B?

Is it because the fox is assumed to be an “unowned” thing
and hence up for grabs by the first person to “capture” it or reduce it to
possession in some

other way, such as by killing it? How do we know foxes are
unowned things? What if the owner of the land on which the fox was hunted down
(or the

proprietors of Southampton, see Note 1 above) asserted a
claim to the fox? What if the State of New York claimed ownership of all wild
animals found

within the state? See Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U.S. 519 (
1896 ) (holding that state could prohibit transport of captured wild animals to
another state

because the state owned such animals before they were
captured); Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U.S. 322 ( 1979 ) (overruling _Geer_ ).

4 .First possession is a widespread device for establishing
claims of ownership in a variety of contexts, not just wild-animal law. Why?
One set of

answers centers around Locke’s famous defense of private
property based on labor and individual desert. See John Locke, Two Treatises of
Government,

Second Treatise, §§ 25 – 51 , at 285 – 302 (Peter Laslett
ed., 1988 ) ( 1690 ). Locke argued that every person owns his own body and his
own labor. Hence,

when a person mixes his labor with some unclaimed thing
(like a wild animal), that person can justly claim also to own the thing.
Certainly, Locke

argued, the person who has expended labor acquiring the
object has a better claim to it than anyone else, as long as he leaves “enough
and as good” for

others to acquire, and does not overclaim things to the
point that they spoil or go to waste. Which of the two opinions in _Pierson v.
Post_ —Justice

Tompkins’s opinion for the majority or Justice Livingston’s
dissent—seems to put the most weight on desert arising from the expenditure of
labor, in

deciding when possession of a wild animal has been
established? Why does mixing labor with a thing make the thing mine rather than
constitute an

abandonment of my labor—or merely give me the right to
demand payment for my services? (See Wetherbee v. Green, infra, and the
treatment of the

common-law doctrine of accession.) For discussion of these
and related questions, see Richard A. Epstein, Possession as the Root of Title,
13 Ga. L.

Rev. 1221 ( 1979 ). Elsewhere in the same article Epstein
also suggests that Livingston’s position might have been correct because the
custom of hunters

would have given the fox to Post. Assuming that was indeed
the custom of hunters, do you agree that custom should provide the basis for
the legal rule?

```



5 .One reason custom might play a role in resolving disputes
over possession is the need to communicate claims of possession to others. Who



```

```



61



```

are the others in _Pierson v. Post_? Pierson, of course. But
should Post be taken as mainly communicating to other hunters? To the general
public? On the

communication problem in possession, see Carol M. Rose,
Possession as the Origin of Property, 52 U. Chi. L. Rev. 73 , 78 ( 1985 );
Henry E. Smith, The

Language of Property: Form, Context, and Audience, 55 Stan.
L. Rev. 1105 , 1115 – 25 ( 2003 ).

6. _Pierson_ is often viewed through the lens of incentives.
   See, e.g., Dhammika Dharmapala & Rohan Pitchford, An Economic Analysis of
   “Riding

to Hounds”: _Pierson v. Post_ Revisited, 18 J.L. Econ. &
Org. 39 ( 2002 ). Does the certain control rule provide less incentive for
hunting foxes, as

Livingston suggests, or does it encourage those in the
position of Post to hurry up and catch the fox? Is protection of poultry really
the object here? It

would seem that huntsmen in England and their imitators in
the United States actually paid farmers to tolerate—and sometimes even to
raise—foxes in

order to have the pleasure of hunting them. See McDowell,
supra.

7 .Whatever the incentive effects in the context of fox
hunting, a first-in-time rule can lead to wasteful competitions and races to be
first. First-in-

time seems to work best when a clear winner will emerge
quickly because of that person’s special skill or relationship to the resource.
That person’s

advantage will forestall wasteful competition to be first.
See, e.g., Dean Lueck, First Possession as the Basis of Property, in Terry L.
Anderson & Fred S.

McChesney, Property Rights: Cooperation, Conflict, and Law
200 ( 2003 ). It can also be helpful if some salient feature marks out the
clear winner such

that potential competitors will recognize the “winner” early
and give up the contest. Does anything in the rule of first possession help
ensure this result?

#### Keeble v. Hickeringill

```



Queen’s Bench, 1707.



11 East 574 , 103 Eng. Rep. 1127 [report date 1809 ].



```

Action upon the case. Plaintiff declares that he was, 8th
November in the second year of the Queen [1704], lawfully possessed of a close
of

land called Minott’s Meadow, [in which was] a decoy pond, to
which divers wildfowl used to resort and come: and the plaintiff had at his own

costs and charges prepared and procured divers decoy ducks,
nets, machines and other engines for the decoying and taking of the wildfowl,
and

enjoyed the benefit in taking them: the defendant, knowing
which, and intending to damnify the plaintiff in his vivary, and to fright and
drive

away the wildfowl used to resort thither, and deprive him of
his profit, did, on the 8th of November, resort to the head of the said pond
and

vivary, and did discharge six guns laden with gunpowder, and
with the noise and stink of the gunpowder did drive away the wildfowl then
being

in the pond: and on the 1 1th and 12th days of November the
defendant, with design to damnify the plaintiff, and fright away the wildfowl,
did

place himself with a gun near the vivary, and there did
discharge the said gun several times that was then charged with the gunpowder
against the

said decoy pond, whereby the wildfowl were

#62

frighted away, and did forsake the said pond. Upon not
guilty pleaded, a verdict was found for the plaintiff and 20£ damages.

■ HOLT
C.J. I am of opinion that this action doth lie. It seems to be new in its
instance, but is not new in the reason or principle of it. For, 1st, this

using or making a decoy is lawful. 2dly, this employment of
his ground to that use is profitable to the plaintiff, as is the skill and
management of

that employment. As to the first, every man that hath a
property may employ it for his pleasure and profit, as for alluring and
procuring decoy

ducks to come to his pond. To learn the trade of seducing
other ducks to come there in order to be taken is not prohibited either by the
law of the

land or the moral law; but it is as lawful to use art to
seduce them, to catch them, and destroy them for the use of mankind, as to kill
and destroy

wildfowl or tame cattle. Then when a man useth his art or
his skill to take them, to sell and dispose of for his profit; this is his
trade; and he that

hinders another in his trade or livelihood is liable to an
action for so hindering him. * * * [W]here a violent or malicious act is done
to a man’s

occupation, profession, or way of getting a livelihood;
there an action lies in all cases. But if a man doth him damage by using the
same

employment; as if Mr. Hickeringill had set up another decoy
on his own ground near the plaintiff’s, and that had spoiled the custom of the

plaintiff, no action would lie, because he had as much
liberty to make and use a decoy as the plaintiff. This is like the case of 11
H. 4, 47. One

schoolmaster sets up a new school to the damage of an
antient school, and thereby the scholars are allured from the old school to
come to his

new. (The action was held there not to lie.) But suppose Mr.
Hickeringill should lie in the way with his guns, and fright the boys from
going to

school, and their parents would not let them go thither;
sure that schoolmaster might have an action for the loss of his scholars. 29 E.
3, 18. A

man hath a market, to which he hath toll for horses sold: a
man is bringing his horse to market to sell: a stranger hinders and obstructs
him from

going thither to the market: an action lies, because it
imports damage. Action upon the case lies against one that shall by threats
fright away his

tenants at will. 9 H. 7, 8. 21 H. 6, 31. 9 H. 7, 7. 14 Ed.
4, 7. Vide Rastal. 662. 2 Cro. 423. * * * Now considering the nature of the
case, it is not

possible to declare of the number that were frighted away;
because the plaintiff had not possession of them, to count them. Where a man
brings

trespass for taking his goods, he must declare of the
quantity, because he, by having had the possession, may know what he had, and
therefore

must know what he lost. * * * The plaintiff in this case
brings his action for the apparent injury done him in the use of that
employment of his

freehold, his art, and skill, that he uses thereby. * * *
And when we do know that of long time in the kingdom these artificial
contrivances of

decoy ponds and decoy ducks have been used for enticing into
those ponds wildfowl, in order to be taken for the profit of the owner of the
pond,

who is at the expence of servants, engines, and other
management, whereby the markets of the nation may be furnished; there is great
reason to

give encouragement thereunto; that the people who are so
instrumental by

#63

their skill and industry so to furnish the markets should
reap the benefit and have their action. But, in short, that which is the true
reason is that

this action is not brought to recover damage for the loss of
the fowl, but for the disturbance; as 2 Cro. 604, Dawney v Dee. So is the usual
and

common way of declaring.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Samuel Keeble was a yeoman who made a living from
catching ducks. A duck decoy is an elaborate system of passages and nets.
According to

Brian Simpson, both Keeble and his neighbor, Hickeringill,
had constructed duck decoys. Keeble’s original decoy was far away from his
neighbor’s, but

when Keeble built a new decoy much closer to Hickeringill’s,
the closeness and the resultant competition provoked a characteristically
direct response

from the latter. Edmund Hickeringill, for whom the term
“eccentric” hardly does justice, has been called a “half crazy minister and
controversial

pamphleteer.” (His last work is apparently “A Burlesque Poem
in Praise of Ignorance,” in which he has unkind things to say of lawyers.) He
was an

excommunicated Baptist, then a Quaker, then a Deist. After a
military career at the end of the Commonwealth, he was ordained in the Church
of

England. His troubles and disputes, both inside and outside
the courtroom, were epic—particularly with his bishop, who after Hickeringill’s
death is said

to have ordered the complimentary remarks chiseled off
Hickeringill’s tombstone. Despite all this behavior, Hickeringill would be

```

```

considered a gentleman landowner. A.W. Brian Simpson,
Leading Cases in the Common Law 58 – 61 ( 1995 ); A.R. Solly, Edmund
Hickeringill,

Eccentric, 58 Essex Rev. 127 ( 1949 ).

2 .This case is the subject of multiple, conflicting
reports. The others are 11 Mod. 74 , 130 (sub nom. Keeble v. Hickringill); 3
Salk. 9 (sub nom.

Keeble v. Hickeringhall). The one reproduced here, from the
East report and reprinted in the English Reports, was taken from a manuscript
by Chief

Justice Holt and is thought to be the most reliable. Notice
that the version of _Keeble_ cited in _Pierson v. Post_ , supra, characterizes
the grounds of decision

quite differently, as resting on _ratione soli_. The East
version was not available until after the decision in _Pierson v. Post_. Does
this change your view of

_Pierson_?

3 .The case is brought in trespass on the case rather than
plain trespass, because Hickeringill did not physically invade Keeble’s land.
How would

the court in _Hendricks v. Stalnaker_ (see Chapter I) have
handled this type of dispute? How if at all would the newness of Keeble’s
second decoy and its

proximity to Hickeringill’s older decoy affect a balancing
of the gravity of the harm versus the utility of the defendant’s conduct?

4 .The law is often called upon to regulate various forms of
competition. Cases like _Pierson v. Post_ and other possession cases in the
following

materials involve competition to capture resources—sometimes
but not always wild animals—and make them into private property. _Keeble v.

Hickeringill_ is about wild animals, but is it about
property in animals? Property in land? About competition? Is this competition
harmful? How can one

tell whether a given type of competition is harmful or
beneficial overall? See, e.g., Harold Demsetz, Wealth Distribution and the
Ownership of Rights, 1

J. Legal Stud. 223 , 231 – 32 ( 1972 ); Benjamin L. Fine, An
Analysis of the Formation of Property Rights Underlying Tortious Interference
with Contracts

and Other Economic Relations, 50 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1116 ( 1983
).

Consider in this regard that the East version of _Keeble_
was reported as a note to a similar case from 1809 , _Carrington v. Taylor_ ,
11 East 571 , 103

Eng. Rep. 1126 (K.B. 1809 ). In that case, the defendant had
shot at birds from a boat in a public river and drove them from plaintiff’s
“ancient decoy”—

but he did not shoot into the decoy. The court held there
was sufficient evidence of “willful disturbance” to support a jury verdict for
the plaintiff.

### 2 .OPEN ACCESS AND THE COMMONS

First possession is used to establish ownership when the
thing being claimed is regarded as unowned—as being up for grabs. We need to

form a clearer understanding of this state of affairs in
order to have a better sense of the contexts in which things are eligible for
claiming through

first possession. That state of affairs is often referred to
as a “commons,” but this term is fraught with ambiguity.

The tragedy of the commons

Since Garrett Hardin’s challenging article in Science
(1968), the expression “the tragedy of the commons” has come to symbolize the

degradation of the environment to be expected whenever many
individuals use a scarce resource in common. To illustrate the logical
structure of

his model, Hardin asks the reader to envision a pasture
“open to all.” He then examines the structure of this situation from the
perspective of a

rational herder. Each herder receives a direct benefit from
his own animals and suffers delayed costs from the deterioration of the commons
when

his and others’ cattle overgraze. Each herder is motivated
to add more and more animals because he receives the direct benefit of his own

animals and bears only a share of the costs resulting from
overgrazing. Hardin concludes:

Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system
that compels him to increase his herd without limit—in a world that is limited.

Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each
pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the

commons.

Hardin was not the first to notice the tragedy of the
commons. Aristotle long ago observed that “what is common to the greatest
number has the

least care bestowed upon it. Everyone thinks chiefly of his
own, hardly at all of the common interest” ( Politics , Book II, ch. 3).
Hobbes’s parable

of man in a state of nature is a prototype of the tragedy of
the commons: Men seek their own good and end up fighting one another. In 1833,

William Forster Lloyd sketched a theory of the commons that
predicted improvident use for property owned in common. More than a decade

before Hardin’s article, H. Scott Gordon (1954) clearly
expounded similar logic in another classic: “The Economic Theory of a Common-

Property Research: The Fishery.” Gordon described the same
dynamic as Hardin:

There appears then, to be some truth in the conservative
dictum that everybody’s property is nobody’s property. Wealth that is free for

all is valued by no one because he who is foolhardy enough
to wait for its proper time of use will only find that it has been taken by

another.... The fish in the sea are valueless to the
fisherman, because there is no assurance that they will be there for him
tomorrow if

they are left behind today.

John H. Dales (1968) noted at the same time the perplexing
problems related to resources “owned in common because there is no
alternative!”

Standard analyses in modern resource economics conclude that
where a number of users have access to a common-pool resource, the total of

resource units withdrawn from the resource will be greater
than the optimal economic level of withdrawal. * * *

#CURRENT POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS

Leviathan as the “only” way

Ophuls (1973) argued, for example, that “because of the
tragedy of the commons, environmental problems cannot be solved through

cooperation... and the rationale for government with major
coercive powers is overwhelming.” Ophuls concluded that “even if we avoid the

tragedy of the commons, it will only be by recourse to the
tragic necessity of Leviathan.” Garrett Hardin argued a decade after his
earlier article

that we are enveloped in a “cloud of ignorance” about “the
true nature of the fundamental political systems and the effect of each on the

preservation of the environment.” The “cloud of ignorance”
did not, however, prevent him from presuming that the only alternatives to the

commons dilemma were what he called “a private enterprise
system,” on the one hand, or “socialism,” on the other. With the assurance of
one

convinced that the alternative of the commons is “too
horrifying to contemplate”, Hardin indicated that change would have to be
instituted with

“whatever force may be required to make the change stick.”
In other words, “if ruin is to be avoided in a crowded world, people must be

responsive to a coercive force outside their individual
psyches, a ‘Leviathan,’ to use Hobbes’s term.”

The presumption that an external Leviathan is necessary to
avoid tragedies of the commons leads to recommendations that central

governments control most natural resource systems. * * *

The optimal equilibrium achieved by following the advice to
centralize control, however, is based on assumptions concerning the accuracy

of information, monitoring capabilities, sanctioning
reliability, and zero costs of administration. Without valid and reliable
information, a central

agency could make several errors, including setting the
carrying capacity or the fine too high or too low, sanctioning herders who
cooperate, or

not sanctioning defectors. * * *

Privatization as the “only” way

Other policy analysts, influenced by the same models, have
used equally strong terms in calling for the imposition of private property
rights

whenever resources are owned in common (Demsetz 1967; O.
Johnson 1972). “Both the economic analysis of common property resources and

Hardin’s treatment of the tragedy of the commons” led Robert
J. Smith (1981) to suggest that “the only way to avoid the tragedy of the
commons

in natural resources and wildlife is to end the
common-property system by creating a system of private property rights.” Smith
stressed that it is

“by treating a resource as a common property that we become
locked in its inexorable destruction.” Welch advocated the creation of full
private

rights to a commons when he asserted that “the establishment
of full property rights is necessary to avoid the inefficiency of overgrazing”
(1983).

He asserted that privatization of the commons was the
optimal solution for all common-pool problems. His major

#67

concern was how to impose private ownership when those
currently using a commons were unwilling to change to a set of private rights
to the

commons.

Those recommending the imposition of privatization on the
herders would divide the meadow in half and assign half of the meadow to one

herder and the other half to the second herder. Now each
herder will be playing a game against nature in a smaller terrain, rather than
a game

against another player in a larger terrain. The herders now
will need to invest in fences and their maintenance, as well as in monitoring
and

sanctioning activities to enforce their division of the
grazing area. It is presumed that each herder will now choose X/2 animals to
graze as a

result of his own profit incentive. This assumes that the
meadow is perfectly homogeneous over time in its distribution of available
fodder. If

rainfall occurs erratically, one part of the grazing area
may be lush with growth one year, whereas another part of the area may be
unable to

support X/2 animals. The rain may fall somewhere else the
next year. In any given year, one of the herders may make no profit, and the
other

may enjoy a considerable return. If the location of lush
growth changes dramatically from year to year, dividing the commons may
impoverish

both herders and lead to overgrazing in those parts where
forage is temporarily inadequate. Of course, it will be possible for the herder
who has

extra fodder in one year to sell it to the other herder.
Alternatively, it will be possible for the herders to set up an insurance
scheme to share the

risk of an uncertain environment. However, the setup costs
for a new market or a new insurance scheme would be substantial and will not be

needed so long as the herders share fodder and risk by
jointly sharing a larger grazing area. * * *

If one recommendation is correct, the other cannot be.
Contradictory positions cannot both be right. I do not argue for either of
these

positions. Rather, I argue that both are too sweeping in
their claims. Instead of there being a single solution to a single problem, I
argue that many

solutions exist to cope with many different problems.
Instead of presuming that optimal institutional solutions can be designed
easily and

imposed at low cost by external authorities, I argue that
“getting the institutions right” is a difficult, time-consuming,
conflict-invoking process. It

is a process that requires reliable information about time
and place variables as well as a broad repertoire of culturally acceptable
rules. New

institutional arrangements do not work in the field as they
do in abstract models unless the models are well specified and empirically
valid and

the participants in a field setting understand how to make
the new rules work.

Instead of presuming that the individuals sharing a commons
are inevitably caught in a trap from which they cannot escape, I argue that the

capacity of individuals to extricate themselves from various
types of dilemma situations varies from situation to situation. The cases to be

#68

discussed in this book illustrate both successful and
unsuccessful efforts to escape tragic outcomes. * * *

An alternative solution

To open up the discussion of institutional options for
solving commons dilemmas, I want now to present [another outcome] in which the

herders themselves can make a binding contract to commit
themselves to a cooperative strategy that they themselves will work out. * * *

The herders * * * must now negotiate prior to placing
animals on the meadow. During negotiations, they discuss various strategies for

sharing the carrying capacity of the meadow and the costs of
enforcing their agreement. Contracts are not enforceable, however, unless
agreed to

unanimously by the herders. Any proposal made by one herder
that did not involve an equal sharing of the carrying capacity and of
enforcement

costs would be vetoed by the other herder in their
negotiations. Consequently, the only feasible agreement—and the equilibrium * *

* —is for

both herders to share equally the sustainable yield levels
of the meadow and the costs of enforcing their agreement so long as each
herder’s share

of the cost of enforcement is less than [that herder’s share
of the benefits]. * * *

A self-financed contract-enforcement game is no panacea.
Such institutional arrangements have many weaknesses in many settings. The

herders can overestimate or underestimate the carrying
capacity of the meadow. Their own monitoring system may break down. The
external

enforcer may not be able to enforce ex post, after promising
to do so ex ante. A myriad of problems can occur in natural settings, as is
also the

case with the idealized central-regulation or
private-property institutions. * * *

An empirical alternative

* * * Let us now briefly consider a solution devised by
      participants in a field setting—Alanya, Turkey—that cannot be characterized as

either central regulation or privatization. The inshore
fishery at Alanya, as described by Fikret Berkes (1986b), is a relatively small
operation.

Many of the approximately 100 local fishers operate in two-
or three-person boats using various types of nets. Half of the fishers belong
to a

local producers’ cooperative. According to Berkes, the early
1970s were the “dark ages” for Alanya. The economic viability of the fishery
was

threatened by two factors: First, unrestrained use of the
fishery had led to hostility and, at times, violent conflict among the users.
Second,

competition among fishers for the better fishing spots had
increased production costs, as well as the level of uncertainty regarding the
harvest

potential of any particular boat.

Early in the 1970s, members of the local cooperative began
experimenting with an ingenious system for allotting fishing sites to local

#69

fishers. After more than a decade of trial-and-error
efforts, the rules used by the Alanya inshore fishers are as follows:

Each September, a list of eligible fishers is prepared,
consisting of all licensed fishers in Alanya, regardless of co-op membership.

Within the area normally used by Alanya fishers, all usable
fishing locations are named and listed. These sites are spaced so that the

nets set in one site will not block the fish that should be
available at the adjacent sites.

These named fishing locations and their assignments are in
effect from September to May.

In September, the eligible fishers draw lots and are
assigned to the named fishing locations.

From September to January, each day each fisher moves east
to the next location. After January, the fishers move west. This gives

the fishers equal opportunities at the stocks that migrate
from east to west between September and January and reverse their

migration through the area from January to May.

The system has the effect of spacing the fishers far enough
apart on the fishing grounds that the production capabilities at each site are

optimized. All fishing boats also have equal chances to fish
at the best spots. Resources are not wasted searching for or fighting over a
site. No

signs of overcapitalization are apparent.

The list of fishing locations is endorsed by each fisher and
deposited with the mayor and local gendarme once a year at the time of the

lottery. The process of monitoring and enforcing the system
is, however, accomplished by the fishers themselves as a by-product of the
incentive

created by the rotation system. * * * Cheating on the system
will be observed by the very fishers who have rights to be in the best spots
and will

be willing to defend their rights using physical means if
necessary. Their rights will be supported by everyone else in the system. The
others will

want to ensure that their own rights will not be usurped on
the days when they are assigned good sites. The few infractions that have
occurred

have been handled easily by the fishers at the local
coffeehouse. (Berkes 1986b, p. 74).

Although this is not a private-property system, rights to
use fishing sites and duties to respect these rights are well defined. And
though it is

not a centralized system, national legislation that has
given such cooperatives jurisdiction over “local arrangements” has been used by

cooperative officials to legitimize their role in helping to
devise a workable set of rules. That local officials accept the signed
agreement each

year also enhances legitimacy. The actual monitoring and
enforcing of the rules, however, are left to the fishers. * * *

#70

Many potential answers spring to mind regarding the question
why some individuals do not achieve collective benefits for themselves,

whereas others do. However, as long as analysts presume that
individuals cannot change such situations themselves, they do not ask what
internal

or external variables can enhance or impede the efforts of
communities of individuals to deal creatively and constructively with perverse

problems such as the tragedy of the commons.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .As Ostrom notes, the potential problems with open access
have long been apparent, long before Garrett Hardin coined the immensely
influential

phrase, “the tragedy of the commons,” to describe the
problems associated with an open-access resource in which there is an
unrestricted privilege to

capture some valued feature of the resource. See Garrett
Hardin, The Tragedy of the Commons, 162 Science 1243 ( 1968 ). H. Scott
Gordon’s classic

analysis, H.S. Gordon, The Economic Theory of a Common
Property Resource: The Fishery, 62 J. Pol. Econ. 124 ( 1954 ), had been
anticipated many

years earlier by Jens Warming, writing in Danish. See Om
“Grundrente” af Fiskegrunde, 49 Nationalökonomisk Tidsskrift 495 ( 1911 ),
transl. in P.

Anderson, “On Rent of Fishing Grounds”: A Translation of
Jens Warming’s 1911 Article, with an Introduction, 15 Hist. Pol. Econ. 391 (
1983 ). So who

gets to claim to be the “first possessor” of the idea of the
tragedy of the commons: Aristotle, Warming, Gordon, or Hardin? Does this
example provide a

clue as to why ideas are not subject to ownership through
first possession?

2 .Hardin was a biologist, and his big concern was with
overpopulation. His work fits into a neo-Malthusian movement of the 1960 s and
1970 s

that emphasized the finiteness of the earth and predicted
imminent depletion of natural resources. That there is a potential tragedy in
the use of natural

resources is well understood. But in what sense is there an
additional tragedy of the commons in “breeding,” as Hardin believed?

3 .Hardin’s primary example, the traditional grazing
commons, was hardly tragic. Grazing commons in traditional agricultural
societies such as

those of medieval and early modern Europe were not open
access. A limited group had grazing rights and exercised the right to exclude
noncommoners.

Over centuries, those with access to common grazing areas
governed their behavior with restrictions on the amount and manner of grazing.
Some of

these grazing commons survive to this day and do not show
obvious signs of tragedy. Elsewhere in Ostrom’s book and in the rest of her
work, for which

she won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 2009 , she
analyzes a range of case studies and explores factors leading toward and away
from

tragedy.

4 .Solutions to the problem of the commons require some form
of coercion or cooperation. For example, a group of herders might (as has often

happened) institute rules to limit their use of the commons
and achieve conservation. But how is such cooperation forthcoming? Isn’t the
provision of

#71

such rules a commons itself? See James E. Krier, The Tragedy
of the Commons, Part Two, 15 Harv. J.L. & Pub. Pol’y 325 , 336 – 38 ( 1992
).

5 .Another possible solution to overuse of an open access
resource like fisheries is the creation of a new type of property, individual
transferable

quotas (ITQs), which restrict the overall level of access to
the fishery and yet are transferable, so individuals can exit and enter from
the fishing industry.

See, e.g., Christopher Costello, Steven D. Gaines, &
John Lynham, Can Catch Shares Prevent Fisheries Collapse?, 321 Sci. 1678 ( 2008
); Katrina

Wyman, The Recovery in U.S. Fisheries, 31 J. Land Use &
Envtl. L. 149 ( 2016 ). The relative merits of carbon taxes versus
cap-and-trade regulation are

considered in William D. Nordhaus, To Tax or Not to Tax:

Pol’y 26 ( 2007 );

Climate Change: Why a Carbon Tax is a Better Response to Global Warming than
Cap

and Trade, 28 Stan. Envtl. L.J. 3 ( 2009 ).

Commons, Anticommons, and Semicommons

If an open access regime creates the “tragedy of the
commons,” in which no one has the right to exclude anyone else, is there a
mirror

image problem, in which everyone has the right to exclude
everyone else? From a hypothetical proposed by Frank Michelman, Michael Heller

developed the concept of the anticommons , where too many
have the right to exclude and consequently no one is able to use a resource.
Michael

Heller, The Tragedy of the Anticommons: Property in the
Transition from Marx to Markets, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 621 (1998); see also Michael

Heller, The Gridlock Economy: How Too Much Ownership Wrecks
Markets, Stops Innovation, and Costs Lives (2008); Frank I. Michelman,

Ethics, Economics, and the Law of Property, in NOMOS XXIV:
Ethics, Economics, and the Law 3, 15 (1982). Heller’s original example was

street kiosks in post-Soviet Moscow. Because too many
stakeholders had rights in storefronts and could prevent their use, new
businesses

bypassed empty store buildings and set up shop in metal
kiosks on the sidewalks in front of the stores. Traditional holdout problems
can

sometimes be characterized as an anticommons: If too many
permissions are required, rights to a larger resource may never be assembled.

Patents on gene fragments are a particular source of
anticommons worries because research projects may require the collection of
many

permissions from many different patent holders. Michael A.
Heller & Rebecca S. Eisenberg, Can Patents Deter Innovation? The
Anticommons in

Biomedical Research, 280 Science 698 (1998). Evidence is
hard to come by, but surveys of industry participants have found that patents
on

research tools have not restricted access as much as
anticommons theory might suggest; solutions to the problem of fragmented rights
include

licensing, inventing around, infringing, public disclosure,
and litigation. See generally Jonathan Barnett, The Anti-Commons Revisited, 29
Harv.

J. L. & Tech. 127 (2015); Anna B. Laakmann, The New
Genomic Semicommons, 5 UC Irvine L. Rev. 1001 (2015).

#72

Others have argued that in certain specialized contexts, an
anticommons can be a good thing. For example, giving many people a veto over

development of a resource like a park can help secure the
commitment to preserve the park for future generations. Abraham Bell &
Gideon

Parchomovsky, Of Property and Antiproperty, 102 Mich. L.
Rev. 1 (2003). Similarly, there is sometimes virtue to be found in multiple
vetoes in

the political arena. Political scientists and others have
theorized that under some conditions multiple vetoes are beneficial in terms of
producing

stability (with some sacrifice of decisiveness in
decision-making). See, e.g., Josephine T. Andrews & Gabriella R. Montinola,
Veto Players and

the Rule of Law in Emerging Democracies, 37 Comp. Pol. Stud.
55 (2004); George Tsebelis & Eric C. Chang, Veto Players and the Structure
of

Budgets in Advanced Industrialized Countries, 43 Eur. J. of
Pol. Res. 449 (2004). The Framers of the U.S. Constitution may have had
something

like this in mind when setting up a system of federalism and
separation of powers, which creates many checks and balances on political
actors.

See The Federalist No. 51 (James Madison).

Note that the underlying dynamic that creates a tragedy of
the anticommons is similar to that which gives rise to the tragedy of the

commons. For each tragedy, the individual has an incentive
to act in a way that imposes costs on others, either by exercising her right of
access

(to a commons) or her right to exclude others (from an
anticommons). For each tragedy, overcoming the problem requires some kind of

realignment of rights, and doing this requires dealing with
holdouts and freeriders. So are there really mirror image problems, or is there
only one

underlying tragedy at work? For discussion, see James M.
Buchanan & Yong J. Yoon, Symmetric Tragedies: Commons and Anticommons, 43

J.L. & Econ. 1 (2000); Lee Anne Fennell, Common Interest
Tragedies, 98 Nw. U. L. Rev. 907 (2004); Francesco Parisi, Norbert Schulz &
Ben

Depoorter, Duality in Property: Commons and Anticommons, 25
Int’l Rev. L. & Econ. 578 (2006). The commons and anticommons are usually

discussed in terms of efficiency and specific interventions.
How much do we need to account for basic questions of distributional justice
and the

foundations of entitlements? Compare David
Blankfein-Tabachnick, Intellectual Property and Midlevel Principles, 101 Calif.
L. Rev. 1315,

1347–48 (2013) (arguing for essential role for
distributional considerations and baselines in justifying IP) with Robert P.
Merges, Foundations

and Principles Redux: A Reply to Professor
Blankfein-Tabachnick, 101 Calif. L. Rev. 1361, 1381 (2013) (defending an
approach to justice in IP

that focuses on mid-level principles—efficiency,
preservation of the public domain, proportionality, and dignity—distinct from
foundations that

justify why we have an IP system at all).

The commons and the anticommons are not the only
common-property regimes in town. Others have identified the semicommons , which

occurs when a given resource is subject to private exclusion
rights

#73

in some uses or along other related dimensions, but is a
commons or open access for other purposes or along other dimensions. In many

traditional grazing commons farmers would have exclusive
rights to particular strips of land to grow crops during part of the year, but
then the

strips would be thrown open for common grazing during other
parts of the year. See Henry E. Smith, Semicommon Property Rights and

Scattering in the Open Fields, 29 J. Legal Stud. 131 (2000).
In such a system, individuals will have an incentive to favor their part of the

semicommons (with goods like manure) and to trash other
parts of the semicommons (with excessive trampling, etc.); elaborate governance
rules

and configurations of rights seem to have been developed to
contain these problems. Intellectual property rights are particularly likely to
be

incomplete, leaving room for interaction between exclusion
rights and the commons (the public domain). For example, consider the doctrine
of

fair use in copyright, which permits copying of portions of
copyrighted works for certain purposes, such as criticism, reporting, or
scholarship.

See 17 U.S.C. § 107. This effectively makes a work subject
to the owner’s exclusive control for some purposes, and yet in the public
domain for

other purposes. For an argument that the Internet is a
semicommons, see James Grimmelmann, The Internet Is a Semicommons, 78 Fordham
L.

Rev. 2799 (2010); see also Robert A. Heverly, The
Information Semicommons, 18 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 1127 (2003). As with the
anticommons, a

full-blown semicommons with an effective governance
structure can be quite stable, but may be hard to change because the
interlocking private

and commons rights are difficult to disentangle and
negotiate over. Even the classic commons mixes common and private. Fish in the
ocean are

regarded as an open-access resource in their natural state,
but once they have been reduced to possession under the rule of capture they
are

regarded as privately owned.

### 3 .OTHER APPLICATIONS OF FIRST POSSESSION

The principle of first possession applies in contexts
besides hunting and fishing. For example, abandoned or lost property is subject
to the

rule of first possession. Suppose you decide to dispose of
your old computer monitor by setting it on the curb where the garbage gets
picked up.

You have in effect relinquished ownership of the monitor,
and implicitly signaled that it can now be claimed by the first person who
comes along

and decides to take possession of it. Or, suppose you lose a
ring that falls out of your pocket on the public sidewalk. Here, you have not

relinquished ownership, but (subject to some qualifications
considered later in the chapter) the first person who comes along and decides
to take

possession of the ring can claim a kind of qualified
ownership of it: The finder has a superior right to the ring relative to
everyone in the world,

except you , the true owner.

Sunken Vessels. Another area in which possession plays a
crucial, and especially complex, role is the law governing sunken vessels.
Under

#74

the common law as developed in the federal admiralty courts,
possession of sunken vessels gives rise to rights to ownership under the law of

finds, or to rights of salvage under the law of salvage. The
law of maritime finds awarded ownership to the first possessor but only if the
vessel

was abandoned (and not still claimed by its owners or their
insurers), and therefore unowned at the time of taking possession. Property is

abandoned when an owner manifests an intention to relinquish
all future claims of possession or ownership (see Chapter IV).

If the vessel is not abandoned, a successful “salvor” (as
such a person is called in this context) has a claim for a generous percentage
of the

value of the vessel and its cargo, but does not acquire
ownership of the vessel or its full value. See generally Grant Gilmore &
Charles L. Black,

Jr., The Law of Admiralty 532–73 (2d ed. 1975); Thomas J.
Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law ch. 14 (6th ed. 2018). By gaining and

maintaining possession, a salvor would have a right to
engage in salvage without interference from other would be salvors, thus
preventing yet

another instance of the tragedy of the commons. Perhaps not
surprisingly, the standard for possession of a salvor is lower than that for
finders of

abandoned vessels. That is, acts that would be sufficient
for salvage-possession might not be sufficient for a finder to establish
acquisition-

possession. As one court put it:

To enjoy the continued right to exclusive possession and
protection from interference of rival salvors, a salvor must exercise due

diligence and must be capable of actually saving the
property. The salvor must intend to reduce the property to physical possession
by

dealing with the entire wreck site in such a manner as to
warn other potential salvors of the claimed area.

MDM Salvage, Inc. v. Unidentified, Wrecked and Abandoned
Sailing Vessel, 631 F. Supp. 308, 312 (S.D. Fla. 1986). A successful salvor is

entitled to a lien to secure payment of the award (see
Chapter VII). Salvor-in-possession rights, however, do not extend to preventing
others from

visiting or photographing the wreck. See R.M.S. Titanic,
Inc. v. Haver, 171 F.3d 943, 970 (4th Cir. 1999). The law of salvage has
overtones of

unjust enrichment (can you see why?), and like unjust
enrichment it is equitable in character (see Chapter IV). Because the original
owner loses

rights if a vessel is deemed abandoned, courts tend to favor
applying the law of salvage rather than the law of finds in ambiguous
situations.

Traditional maritime principles of finds and salvage were
similar across seafaring nations, relying to a great extent on custom, thus
simplifying

the resolution of questions arising from wrecks in
international waters. More recently, efforts have been made to bring this area
of law under

treaties, but it remains unclear whether these treaties
codify customary international law. See generally David J. Bederman, Law of the
Land,

Law of the Sea: The Lost Link between Customary
International Law and the General Maritime Law, 51 Va. J. Int’l L. 299 (2011).
The most

comprehensive such treaty is the United

#75

Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which the
United States recognizes as a codification of custom but has not ratified.

To maintain possession over a wreck, one needs both to
provide notice and to prove diligence. In the celebrated case of Eads v.
Brazelton ,

79 Am. Dec. 88 (Ark. 1861), Brazelton put blazes on trees on
the shore that allowed one to line up the exact site of the wreck of the
steamboat

America in the Mississippi River, and he floated a buoy over
the wreck. In January 1855, Brazelton had his salvage boat in the area, and was
all

set to begin raising the cargo of lead but he heard of
another wreck and went off to try to raise it. By the time he returned, the
river was running

too high for him to engage in salvage work at the site of
the America. Meanwhile Eads moved in. Eads was a clever inventor (and designer
of the

Eads Bridge in St. Louis) who had developed a dredging boat
he called a “submarine” to which a diving bell was attached. When Eads

commenced salvage operations, Brazelton sought an
injunction, claiming he was the first to find the sunken vessel. The blazes on
the trees and

the buoy would seem more than adequate to signal Brazelton’s
intent to all the world. Nevertheless, the court determined that Brazelton had
not

established possession. Possession requires more than
notice, but also due diligence in acting to achieve full dominion and control
over a

resource. There was no question of Brazelton’s intent to
appropriate and that he had taken steps in that direction before Eads appeared.
But the

court decided that in this context one must have the salvage
vessel over the site of the wreck before one can be said to be in possession of
the

wreck. (It is interesting to ask whether Brazelton would
have lost if he had only been away for a day or two. Would this be consistent
with due

diligence?)

The standard for possession may also be evolving with new
technology that is able to reach wrecks at greater depths. In Columbus-America

Discovery Group, Inc. v. The Unidentified, Wrecked and
Abandoned Sailing Vessel, S.S. Central America , 1989 A.M.C. 1955, 1958 (E.D.
Va.

1989), the court allowed “telepossession,” defined as “(1)
locating the object searched; (2) real time imaging of the object; (3)
placement or

capability to place teleoperated or robotic manipulators on
or near the object, capable of manipulating it as directed by human beings
exercising

control from the surface; and (4) present intent to
control... the location of the object.” Should one be able to claim possession
of foxes by

videotaping them? Why not?

Sunken vessels also often contain valuables, especially old
currency and historically significant items. For gold and silver in any form

hidden for later discovery (other than as unmined minerals
in place) the law of treasure trove may apply. Treasure trove (the term
incorporates

the Norman French word for “found”) applies to caches of
gold and silver and sometimes other valuables on land or sea. (Gold and silver
as part

of burial of the dead was not treasure trove.) In England,
treasure trove with no identified owner belonged to the Crown at its option. In
the

#76

United States, treasure trove is not treated specially but
falls under the general law of finders. Later in this Chapter we take up the
competing

claims of finders and the owners of the place where objects
are found.

Treasure trove often consists of items valuable as both
precious metals and as historical artifacts. Concerns about historic
preservation have

led to major legislation governing sunken vessels. In the
Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987 (ASA), 43 U.S.C. §§ 2102–2106, Congress
declared

that all qualifying wrecks in navigable waters are subject
to federal ownership, which is immediately to be transferred to the state in
whose

waters the wreck is found. Id. § 2105. States in turn have
passed laws that protect archeological sites (as has the federal government for

archeological finds on federal lands, see Archaeological
Resources Protection Act of 1979, 16 U.S.C. §§ 470aa–470mm), and these may
apply to

sunken vessels. Such state laws were formerly preempted to
the extent that they were inconsistent with federal maritime law, but the ASA
now

potentially gives such state preservation statutes greater
scope of application. See Lawrence J. Kahn, Sunken Treasures: Conflicts between

Historic Preservation Law and the Maritime Law of Finds, 7
Tul. Envtl. L.J. 595, 630 (1993). The ASA also rejects the traditional law of
finders

and salvors, the idea being that the states will better
protect the historic value of sunken vessels. Much of the uncertainty produced
by the ASA

stems from the criteria for its application in the first
place: It applies only to wrecks that are abandoned, located on the submerged
land of a state,

and either embedded on the sea floor or eligible for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places. Id. § 2105 (a).

Consider how this plays out in practice. A salvor wishing to
establish rights of find or salvage in a wreck could file an in rem action
against

the ship—meaning the vessel is fictionally treated as the
defendant and the litigation will establish the rights of everyone to that
“thing”—in

federal district court under its admiralty jurisdiction. But
to establish admiralty jurisdiction will often require divulging the site of
the wreck,

which a salvor may be loath to do, both because of potential
marauders and because the state in which the wreck is located may gain full
rights,

leaving the salvor with nothing. For a dramatic example, see
Great Lakes Exploration Group, LLC v. Unidentified Wrecked and (For Salvage-

Right Purposes), Abandoned Sailing Vessel, 522 F.3d 682 (6th
Cir. 2008). Jockeying over disclosure can also occur in an international
context.

See, e.g., Sea Hunt, Inc. v. Unidentified Shipwrecked Vessel
or Vessels, 221 F.3d 634 (4th Cir. 2000). For these reasons, commentators have

sometimes proposed—and salvors have tried (mostly
unsuccessfully) to assert—intellectual property rights over their finds. See,
e.g., Justin S.

Stern, Smart Salvage: Extending Traditional Maritime Law to
Include Intellectual Property Rights in Historic Shipwrecks, 68 Fordham L. Rev.

2489 (2000).

Home Run Baseballs. In the late 1990s, major league baseball
players, assisted (it now appears) by performance-enhancing drugs,

#77

began hitting record numbers of home runs. Milestone home
run balls became important collector’s items, commanding large sums of money.

Not surprisingly, fans inside and sometimes outside the ball
parks engaged in intense competitions to snag one of these prize home run
baseballs.

These competitions, in turn, sometimes generated
controversies about who had been the first to capture or reduce to possession a
particular ball.

The most famous of these controversies resulted in a
litigated decision, Popov v. Hayashi , 2002 WL 31833731 (Cal. Super. Ct. 2002).

Baseballs used in professional baseball games are considered
the property of the home team, but once they leave the playing field are

regarded as abandoned property. Like other abandoned
property, they can be claimed by the first person to take possession of them.
The Popov

case involved a dispute over who was the first to possess
the record-setting 73rd home run ball hit by Barry Bonds of the San Francisco
Giants at

San Francisco’s PacBell Park on October 7, 2 001. A
videotape recorded at the scene showed that after the ball sailed over the
fence, it landed in

the webbing of a softball glove worn by Alex Popov. It was
unclear from the tape, however, whether Popov had full control of the ball as
he fell

to the ground. Popov was immediately engulfed by a mob of
fans, who grabbed and kicked at him trying to obtain the ball. At some point,
the

ball came loose from the scrum, and was picked up by Patrick
Hayashi (who had also been knocked down by the mob). Hayashi stood up, put the

ball in his pocket, and waited until he had the attention of
the video camera operator, at which time he held the ball aloft, showing that
he had the

ball. Popov sued Hayashi, claiming that Popov was the first
possessor and hence was entitled to the ball. At the time of trial, it was
thought the

ball might be worth as much as $1 million, although
eventually it was sold for $450,000.

The trial featured, in addition to the videotape and the
testimony of numerous eye witnesses, a discussion forum of several law
professors

about the application of the rule of first possession to
home run baseballs. Judge Patrick McCarthy, who presided over the trial,
eventually

reached a Solomonic judgment: He decreed that the ball
should be sold, with half the proceeds given to Popov and half to Hayashi. He
reasoned

that although Popov could not prove that he had established
possession of the baseball, once it landed in his mitt he had an exclusive
“pre-

possessory interest” in being allowed to complete the catch
without interference. The mob had interfered with this interest. Hayashi, for
his part,

had not been part of the mob, and was the first
unambiguously to establish possession of the ball. Judge McCarthy concluded:
“Both men have a

superior claim to the ball as against all the world. Each
man has a claim of equal dignity as to the other. * * * The court therefore
declares that

both plaintiff and defendant have an equal and undivided
interest in the ball. * * * In order to effectuate this ruling, the ball must
be sold and the

proceeds divided equally between the parties.” As authority
for ordering the property sold

#78

and the proceeds divided, the judge cited a law review
article, R.H. Helmholz, Equitable Division and the Law of Finders, 52 Fordham
L. Rev.

313 (1983), which in turn built on a student note, Comment,
Lost, Mislaid and Abandoned Property, 8 Fordham L. Rev. 222 (1939). See also

Gideon Parchomovsky, Peter Siegelman, & Steve Thel, Of
Equal Wrongs and Half Rights, 82 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 738 (2007). Nevertheless,
decisions

that divide an asset between two potential possessors are
rare. Splitting entitlements—or their value—has been more popular with
commentators

than with courts. Why do you suppose division is not used
more often? Would you recommend this as a solution to wild animal cases like

Pierson v. Post? Is there anything about home run baseballs
that makes such cases different?

What role should custom play in determining the rules for
establishing ownership of home run baseballs? If custom is important, which

customs should we look to? The rules of sports like baseball
deal with questions about when a player controls a ball sufficiently to be
deemed to

have caught it. Are these rules relevant to determine
whether a fan has possession of a ball hit out of the park? There has been an
outpouring of

scholarship on the question of ownership of milestone home
run baseballs. See, e.g., Peter Adomeit, The Barry Bonds Baseball Case—An

Empirical Approach—Is Fleeting Possession Five Tenths of the
Ball?, 48 St. Louis U. L.J. 475 (2004); Paul Finkelman, Fugitive Baseballs and

Abandoned Property: Who Owns the Home Run Ball?, 23 Cardozo
L. Rev. 1609 (2002); Steven Semeraro, An Essay on Property Rights in

Milestone Home Run Baseballs, 56 SMU L. Rev. 2281 (2003).

The potential for violence among fans is yet another (vivid)
example of wasteful and destructive racing behavior. These problems also face

fishers, salvors, and oil drillers. Observers of
intellectual property rights have pointed out that too great a reward for being
the first to invent can

lead to wasteful races. Some scholars have hypothesized that
first possession works best when a clear winner is declared at a stage when
other

competitors are unlikely to be able to compete effectively.
Thus, first-in-time rules work best when potential appropriators have
heterogeneous

knowledge and abilities. Conversely, where multiple actors
must share a resource under a governance scheme of rules of proper use, it is
helpful

if all those sharing the resource have similar abilities and
knowledge. Homogeneity of appropriators conduces to well-functioning governance

regimes. See Dean Lueck, The Rule of First Possession and
the Design of the Law, 38 J.L. & Econ. 393 (1995); David D. Haddock, First

Possession Versus Optimal Timing: Limiting the Dissipation
of Economic Value, 64 Wash. U. L.Q. 775 (1986). What implications does this

hypothesis have for determining how to allocate home run
baseballs? Are the potential appropriators here relatively homogeneous in their

knowledge and ability, or heterogeneous?

Oil and Gas. Under the common law, oil and gas are subject
to the rule of capture, an application of first possession. Surface owners are

free

#79

to pump oil and gas from the surface of their parcels, as
long as the drilling apparatus stays within the “column of space” projected
down from

the surface. Slant drilling, i.e., drilling down at an angle
that intersects a neighbor’s column of space, is a form of trespass. In other
legal systems,

ownership of the surface does not entail ownership of
minerals found beneath the surface. Many civil-law countries, including most
Latin

American countries, follow the rule that minerals below the
surface are owned by the government. See Peter Bakewell, Mining, in Colonial

Spanish America 203, 232 (Leslie Bethell ed., 1987).

Under the common-law rule of capture, oil and gas are not
considered owned by anyone until reduced to possession. But if some curbs are

not placed on pumping, a tragedy of the commons will result.
Pumping will be too rapid, thereby wasting the natural propulsion from gas
located

around the oil. The race to pump would also lead to greater
surface storage of oil, leading to dangerous fires. In theory, a contract among
all

surface owners would be mutually beneficial, but most oil
and gas fields involve numerous and heterogeneous participants, leading to high

transaction costs in private bargaining for mutual
forbearance. One solution is for each owner to take shares in a field under
unitary management.

This solution, called “unitization,” can arise by contract,
but with more than four participants, it usually only arises late in the life
of an oil and

gas field. For this reason, statutes sometimes provide for
compulsory unitization upon a vote by some supermajority of the owners over the
field.

See Gary D. Libecap, Contracting for Property Rights 95–107
(1989); Gary D. Libecap & James L. Smith, Regulatory Remedies to the Common

Pool: The Limits to Oil Field Unitization, 22 Energy J. 1
(2001). Part of the problem is informational: Surface owners know more about
their

own claims than others’ and cannot credibly convey that
information, and after unitization, it is impossible to tell how each
participant would

have fared in the absence of an agreement.

The severe tendency toward a tragedy of the commons (open
access) presents a host of institutional choice questions. In addition to

compulsory unitization, statutes and regulations govern well
spacing, rates of extraction, and the manner of drilling and extraction. For
the vast

amounts of oil and gas on federal lands or on the
outer-continental shelf, the federal government can act as a unitary owner, and
exploitation and

development on these lands is governed by the Mineral
Leasing Act of 1920, 30 U.S.C. § 181. Although the government as owner can
succumb

to its own set of inadequacies (as demonstrated in the
Deepwater Horizon oil spill and its aftermath), an unconstrained race to
exploit the

resource is not one of them.

Property scholars tend to focus on the common law of oil and
gas, and the common law by itself is not up to the task of solving the tragedy

inherent in oil and gas, in the absence of statute or
regulations. The baseline common law rule, as mentioned, is the rule of
capture. Sometimes in

a bit of colorful metaphor, oil and gas are called fugacious

#80

or fugitive minerals and analogized to wild animals. The
literature excoriating the rule of capture and the wild animal analogy is vast,
especially

for being insufficiently “pragmatic” and “empirical.” See
Richard A. Posner, Overcoming Law 399 (1995). Like many others, Posner
announces

that the “intelligent” answer is not to analogize to wild
animals or use the rule of capture. Id. at 520. But the real question is what
mixture of

action by courts, legislatures, regulators, and the parties
themselves is most cost-effective at solving the problem. Looked at in this
light, the wild

animal analogy is a short hand for the difficulty
(especially for courts) of delineating property rights to this resource (given
that oil and gas is not

owned by the state and the configuration of surface parcels
is fragmented for non-oil and gas related reasons such as farming). See, e.g.,
Rance L.

Craft, Of Reservoir Hogs and Pelt Fiction: Defending the
Ferae Naturae Analogy Between Petroleum and Wildlife, 44 Emory L.J. 697 (1995);

Dean Lueck, The Rule of First Possession and the Design of
the Law, 38 J.L. & Econ. 393, 425 (1995). Courts have been able to police
around

the edges, by labeling as a nuisance activities like letting
oil burn off. See generally Henry E. Smith, Semicommons in Fluid Resources, 20
Marq.

Intell. Prop. L. Rev. 195 (2016).

One interesting perennial problem that involves reconciling
the ad coelum principle and first possession is the reinjection of gas into

underground formations for storage purposes. The most famous
common law opinion, Hammonds v. Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co. , 75

S.W.2d 204, 206 (Ky. 1934), overruled by Tex. Am. Energy
Corp. v. Citizens Fidelity Bank & Trust Co., 736 S.W.2d 25 (Ky. 1987), used
the

wild-animal analogy and the rule of capture to hold that
reinjection of gas into a gasless underground formation lying under a
neighbor’s land

was not a trespass. One rationale for the no-trespass result
was that the gas, like a wild animal released into the wild, was now ownerless
and so

would not give rise to trespass liability for the releasing
party. 75 S.W.2d at 206. An implication of the decision (but not the holding)
is that the

gas, now wild, is again eligible for capture by the first
possessor, which could be any surface owner who lives above part of the
underground

storage reservoir.

Many states did recognize property in oil and gas beneath
surface parcels, in an application of the ad coelum principle, but held that it

disappeared once the minerals left the owner’s column of
space. Nonetheless, the recognition even of this fleeting ownership formed the

predicate for some common law governing extraction, under
the heading of “correlative rights.” But again, to the frustration of many

commentators, the correlative rights doctrine is not very
ambitious, only preventing the grossest forms of waste, such as allowing
blow-outs and

fires. See Elliff v. Texon Drilling Co., 210 S.W.2d 558,
562–63 (Tex. 1948). The main intervention to prevent waste has been legislative
and

regulatory. See, e.g., Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 30–5–101(a)(ix)
(2003) (defining “correlative rights” as “the opportunity afforded the owner of
each

#81

property in a pool to produce, so far as it is reasonably
practicable to do so without waste, his just and equitable share of the oil or
gas, or both, in

the pool”).

How should the reinjection of gas into underground
formations be treated if some ownership of gas in the ground is recognized? An

interesting scenario was presented by another classic, Lone
Star Gas Co. v. Murchison , 353 S.W.2d 870 (Tex. Ct. Civ. App. 1962), in which
the

court considered the claim that a neighboring surface owner
had committed a conversion by sinking a well to extract gas that had been
reinjected

into an underground reservoir by a gas company and that had
migrated under the neighbor’s land. The court rejected the wild animal analogy,

saying that produced natural gas is more like a domestic
animal: “[I]f a horse strays over on a neighbor’s land, the neighbor may be
entitled to his

damages, but he does not, by virtue of the trespass, acquire
title to the horse.” Id. at 877 (quoting William Jarrell Smith). The court held
that the

gas company had an action for conversion against the
neighbor. No issue was presented in Lone Star Gas as to whether the neighbor
could

recover damages for subterranean trespass (or for
restitution?) for the value of the storage facility under his land. Logically,
if the stored gas

remains the personal property of the gas company, it would
seem that the neighbor could sue for trespass, and perhaps could even get an

injunction. This could lead to a classic bilateral monopoly
problem, and perhaps to condemnation of subsurface rights. The court in Lone
Star

Gas in fact mentioned underground storage condemnation
statutes, which many oil and gas states had passed. Id. at 878; see also
Cornwell v.

Central Kentucky Natural Gas, 249 S.W.2d 531 (Ky. 1952)
(finding constitutional a statute providing for condemnation of underground
storage

space when the surface owner is not prevented from
drilling). The details of the condemnation statutes and the private agreements
reached on

storage of natural gas suggest that depleted underground
strata are not worthless or de minimis. The question may arise again if
technology is

developed to capture and sequester carbon dioxide by
injecting it into subsurface areas as part of the effort to control greenhouse
gases. Keep all

these issues in mind when we return to caves and the
accession principle, infra Part E.

What does all this say about the status of the ad coelum
doctrine and the rule of capture? Should natural gas, once captured, remain the

personal property of the gas company when reinjected into a
storage basin, or should reinjection cause the gas company to lose title?

For more on the difficulties of establishing rights to
subsurface deposits of oil and gas, especially in the context of modern
recovery

technologies using hydraulic fracturing technology, see
Briggs v. Southwestern Energy Production Co. , infra Part G.

### B. DISCOVERY

Closely associated with first possession or capture is the
notion that original title to property can be established through discovery.

Certainly, both doctrines rely heavily on being the first to
claim something. But whereas first possession requires that one be the first
actually to

possess an unclaimed thing, discovery establishes a unique
right to possess a thing. The most prominent decision to invoke discovery as a
basis

for ownership was far more controversial than Pierson v.
Post , and undoubtedly far more consequential.

Supreme Court of the United States, 1823.



21 U.S. ( 8 Wheat.) 543.



```

ERROR to the District Court of Illinois. This was an action
of ejectment for lands in the State and District of Illinois, claimed by the

plaintiffs under a purchase and conveyance from the
Piankeshaw Indians, and by the defendant, under a grant from the United States.
It came up

on a case stated, upon which there was a judgment below for
the defendant. * * *

[The statement of facts begins with an elaborate chronology
of the colony of Virginia, founded by royal charter in 1609, which purported to

grant to Virginia lands as far west as present day Illinois
and Indiana. It traces the history of those lands, from a European perspective,
up to the

cession by Virginia to the federal government at the end of
the Revolutionary War. It notes that, “from time immemorial,” the Illinois and

Piankeshaw tribes had actually held and inhabited the lands
in controversy in what is now central and southern Illinois and western
Indiana.

On July 5, 1773, the chiefs of the Illinois sold certain
lands inhabited by the tribe to William Murray and others, for the sum of
$24,000. On

October 18 , 1775, the chiefs of the Piankeshaw sold certain
lands occupied by the tribe to Louis Viviat and others for $31,000. One of the

grantees in this last transaction was Thomas Johnson, who
died in 1819, leaving his interest to his son, Joshua Johnson, and his
grandson,

Thomas Graham, who were plaintiffs in the case.

In 179 5, the Illinois and Piankeshaw tribes entered into
treaties with the United States, retaining certain lands as reservations, but
ceding to

the federal government other of the lands they had
previously occupied. On July 20, 1818, the United States sold to William
M’Intosh, the

defendant, some of the same lands granted by the Piankeshaw
to Thomas Johnson, and subsequently inherited by Joshua Johnson and Thomas

Graham. Johnson and Graham brought an action in ejectment
against M’Intosh, in an effort to establish their superior claim of title to
the lands in

question. The lower courts ruled for the defendant,
M’Intosh.]

#83

■ MR.
CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court. The plaintiffs in
this cause claim the land, in their declaration mentioned,

under two grants, purporting to be made, the first in 1773,
and the last in 1775, by the chiefs of certain Indian tribes, constituting the
Illinois and

the Piankeshaw nations; and the question is, whether this
title can be recognised in the Courts of the United States?

The facts, as stated in the case agreed, show the authority
of the chiefs who executed this conveyance, so far as it could be given by
their

own people; and likewise show, that the particular tribes
for whom these chiefs acted were in rightful possession of the land they sold.
The

inquiry, therefore, is, in a great measure, confined to the
power of Indians to give, and of private individuals to receive, a title which
can be

sustained in the Courts of this country.

As the right of society, to prescribe those rules by which
property may be acquired and preserved is not, and cannot be drawn into
question;

as the title to lands, especially, is and must be admitted
to depend entirely on the law of the nation in which they lie; it will be
necessary, in

pursuing this inquiry, to examine, not singly those
principles of abstract justice, which the Creator of all things has impressed
on the mind of his

creature man, and which are admitted to regulate, in a great
degree, the rights of civilized nations, whose perfect independence is
acknowledged;

but those principles also which our own government has
adopted in the particular case, and given us as the rule for our decision.

On the discovery of this immense continent, the great
nations of Europe were eager to appropriate to themselves so much of it as they
could

respectively acquire. Its vast extent offered an ample field
to the ambition and enterprise of all; and the character and religion of its
inhabitants

afforded an apology for considering them as a people over
whom the superior genius of Europe might claim an ascendency. The potentates of
the

old world found no difficulty in convincing themselves that
they made ample compensation to the inhabitants of the new, by bestowing on
them

civilization and Christianity, in exchange for unlimited
independence. But, as they were all in pursuit of nearly the same object, it
was necessary,

in order to avoid conflicting settlements, and consequent
war with each other, to establish a principle, which all should acknowledge as
the law

by which the right of acquisition, which they all asserted,
should be regulated as between themselves. This principle was, that discovery
gave

title to the government by whose subjects, or by whose
authority, it was made, against all other European governments, which title
might be

consummated by possession.

The exclusion of all other Europeans, necessarily gave to
the nation making the discovery the sole right of acquiring the soil from the

natives, and establishing settlements upon it. It was a
right with which no Europeans could interfere. It was a right which all
asserted for

themselves, and to the assertion of which, by others, all
assented.

#84

Those relations which were to exist between the discoverer
and the natives, were to be regulated by themselves. The rights thus acquired

being exclusive, no other power could interpose between
them.

In the establishment of these relations, the rights of the
original inhabitants were, in no instance, entirely disregarded; but were
necessarily,

to a considerable extent, impaired. They were admitted to be
the rightful occupants of the soil, with a legal as well as just claim to
retain

possession of it, and to use it according to their own
discretion; but their rights to complete sovereignty, as independent nations,
were necessarily

diminished, and their power to dispose of the soil at their
own will, to whomsoever they pleased, was denied by the original fundamental

principle, that discovery gave exclusive title to those who
made it.

While the different nations of Europe respected the right of
the natives, as occupants, they asserted the ultimate dominion to be in

themselves; and claimed and exercised, as a consequence of
this ultimate dominion, a power to grant the soil, while yet in possession of
the

natives. These grants have been understood by all, to convey
a title to the grantees, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy.

The history of America, from its discovery to the present
day, proves, we think, the universal recognition of these principles. * * *

No one of the powers of Europe gave its full assent to this
principle, more unequivocally than England. The documents upon this subject are

ample and complete. So early as the year 1 496, her monarch
granted a commission to the Cabots, to discover countries then unknown to

Christian people , and to take possession of them in the
name of the king of England. Two years afterwards, Cabot proceeded on this
voyage, and

discovered the continent of North America, along which he
sailed as far south as Virginia. To this discovery the English trace their
title. * * *

Thus has our whole country been granted by the crown while
in the occupation of the Indians. These grants purport to convey the soil as

well as the right of dominion to the grantees. * * *

[C]onflicting claims produced a long and bloody war, which
was terminated by the conquest of the whole country east of the Mississippi. In

the treaty of 1763, France ceded and guarantied to Great
Britain, all Nova Scotia, or Acadie, and Canada, with their dependencies; and
it was

agreed, that the boundaries between the territories of the
two nations, in America, should be irrevocably fixed by a line drawn from the
source of

the Mississippi, through the middle of that river and the
lakes Maurepas and Ponchartrain, to the sea. This treaty expressly cedes, and
has always

been understood to cede, the whole country, on the English
side of the dividing line, between the two nations, although a great and
valuable part

of it was occupied by the Indians. Great Britain, on her
part, surrendered to France all her pretensions to the country west of the
Mississippi. It

has never been supposed that she surrendered nothing,

#85

although she was not in actual possession of a foot of land.
She surrendered all right to acquire the country; and any after attempt to
purchase it

from the Indians, would have been considered and treated as
an invasion of the territories of France.

By the 20th article of the same treaty, Spain ceded Florida,
with its dependencies, and all the country she claimed east or southeast of the

Mississippi, to Great Britain. Great part of this territory
also was in possession of the Indians.

By a secret treaty, which was executed about the same time,
France ceded Louisiana to Spain; and Spain has since retroceded the same

country to France. At the time both of its cession and
retrocession, it was occupied, chiefly, by the Indians.

Thus, all the nations of Europe, who have acquired territory
on this continent, have asserted in themselves, and have recognised in others,

the exclusive right of the discoverer to appropriate the
lands occupied by the Indians. Have the American States rejected or adopted
this

principle?

By the treaty which concluded the war of our revolution,
Great Britain relinquished all claim, not only to the government, but to the

“propriety and territorial rights of the United States,”
whose boundaries were fixed in the second article. By this treaty, the powers
of

government, and the right to soil, which had previously been
in Great Britain, passed definitively to these States. We had before taken
possession

of them, by declaring independence; but neither the
declaration of independence, nor the treaty confirming it, could give us more
than that which

we before possessed, or to which Great Britain was before
entitled. It has never been doubted, that either the United States, or the
several States,

had a clear title to all the lands within the boundary lines
described in the treaty, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy, and
that the

exclusive power to extinguish that right, was vested in that
government which might constitutionally exercise it. * * *

The States, having within their chartered limits different
portions of territory covered by Indians, ceded that territory, generally, to
the

United States, on conditions expressed in their deeds of
cession, which demonstrate the opinion, that they ceded the soil as well as
jurisdiction,

and that in doing so, they granted a productive fund to the
government of the Union. The lands in controversy lay within the chartered
limits of

Virginia, and were ceded with the whole country northwest of
the river Ohio. This grant contained reservations and stipulations, which could

only be made by the owners of the soil; and concluded with a
stipulation, that “all the lands in the ceded territory, not reserved, should
be

considered as a common fund, for the use and benefit of such
of the United States as have become, or shall become, members of the

confederation,” & c. “according to their usual
respective proportions in the general charge and expenditure, and shall be
faithfully and bona fide

disposed of for that purpose, and for no other use or
purpose whatsoever.”

#86

The ceded territory was occupied by numerous and warlike
tribes of Indians; but the exclusive right of the United States to extinguish
their

title, and to grant the soil, has never, we believe, been
doubted. * * *

The United States, then, have unequivocally acceded to that
great and broad rule by which its civilized inhabitants now hold this country.

They hold, and assert in themselves, the title by which it
was acquired. They maintain, as all others have maintained, that discovery gave
an

exclusive right to extinguish the Indian title of occupancy,
either by purchase or by conquest; and gave also a right to such a degree of

sovereignty, as the circumstances of the people would allow
them to exercise.

The power now possessed by the government of the United
States to grant lands, resided, while we were colonies, in the crown, or its

grantees. The validity of the titles given by either has
never been questioned in our Courts. It has been exercised uniformly over
territory in

possession of the Indians. The existence of this power must
negative the existence of any right which may conflict with, and control it. An

absolute title to lands cannot exist, at the same time, in
different persons, or in different governments. An absolute, must be an
exclusive title, or

at least a title which excludes all others not compatible
with it. All our institutions recognise the absolute title of the crown,
subject only to the

Indian right of occupancy, and recognise the absolute title
of the crown to extinguish that right. This is incompatible with an absolute
and

complete title in the Indians.

We will not enter into the controversy, whether
agriculturists, merchants, and manufacturers, have a right, on abstract
principles, to expel

hunters from the territory they possess, or to contract
their limits. Conquest gives a title which the Courts of the conqueror cannot
deny, whatever

the private and speculative opinions of individuals may be,
respecting the original justice of the claim which has been successfully
asserted. The

British government, which was then our government, and whose
rights have passed to the United States, asserted title to all the lands
occupied by

Indians, within the chartered limits of the British
colonies. It asserted also a limited sovereignty over them, and the exclusive
right of

extinguishing the title which occupancy gave to them. These
claims have been maintained and established as far west as the river
Mississippi, by

the sword. The title to a vast portion of the lands we now
hold, originates in them. It is not for the Courts of this country to question
the validity

of this title, or to sustain one which is incompatible with
it.

Although we do not mean to engage in the defence of those
principles which Europeans have applied to Indian title, they may, we think,

find some excuse, if not justification, in the character and
habits of the people whose rights have been wrested from them.

The title by conquest is acquired and maintained by force.
The conqueror prescribes its limits. Humanity, however, acting on public

#87

opinion, has established, as a general rule, that the
conquered shall not be wantonly oppressed, and that their condition shall
remain as eligible as

is compatible with the objects of the conquest. Most
usually, they are incorporated with the victorious nation, and become subjects
or citizens of

the government with which they are connected. The new and
old members of the society mingle with each other; the distinction between them
is

gradually lost, and they make one people. Where this
incorporation is practicable, humanity demands, and a wise policy requires,
that the rights

of the conquered to property should remain unimpaired; that
the new subjects should be governed as equitably as the old, and that
confidence in

their security should gradually banish the painful sense of
being separated from their ancient connexions, and united by force to
strangers.

When the conquest is complete, and the conquered inhabitants
can be blended with the conquerors, or safely governed as a distinct people,

public opinion, which not even the conqueror can disregard,
imposes these restraints upon him; and he cannot neglect them without injury to
his

fame, and hazard to his power.

But the tribes of Indians inhabiting this country were
fierce savages, whose occupation was war, and whose subsistence was drawn
chiefly

from the forest. To leave them in possession of their
country, was to leave the country a wilderness; to govern them as a distinct
people, was

impossible, because they were as brave and as high spirited
as they were fierce, and were ready to repel by arms every attempt on their

independence.

What was the inevitable consequence of this state of things?
The Europeans were under the necessity either of abandoning the country, and

relinquishing their pompous claims to it, or of enforcing
those claims by the sword, and by the adoption of principles adapted to the
condition of

a people with whom it was impossible to mix, and who could
not be governed as a distinct society, or of remaining in their neighbourhood,
and

exposing themselves and their families to the perpetual
hazard of being massacred.

Frequent and bloody wars, in which the whites were not
always the aggressors, unavoidably ensued. European policy, numbers, and skill,

prevailed. As the white population advanced, that of the
Indians necessarily receded. The country in the immediate neighbourhood of

agriculturists became unfit for them. The game fled into
thicker and more unbroken forests, and the Indians followed. The soil, to which
the

crown originally claimed title, being no longer occupied by
its ancient inhabitants, was parcelled out according to the will of the
sovereign

power, and taken possession of by persons who claimed
immediately from the crown, or mediately, through its grantees or deputies.

That law which regulates, and ought to regulate in general,
the relations between the conqueror and conquered, was incapable of application

to a people under such circumstances. The resort to some new

#88

and different rule, better adapted to the actual state of
things, was unavoidable. Every rule which can be suggested will be found to be
attended

with great difficulty.

However extravagant the pretension of converting the
discovery of an inhabited country into conquest may appear; if the principle
has been

asserted in the first instance, and afterwards sustained; if
a country has been acquired and held under it; if the property of the great
mass of the

community originates in it, it becomes the law of the land,
and cannot be questioned. So, too, with respect to the concomitant principle,
that the

Indian inhabitants are to be considered merely as occupants,
to be protected, indeed, while in peace, in the possession of their lands, but
to be

deemed incapable of transferring the absolute title to
others. However this restriction may be opposed to natural right, and to the
usages of

civilized nations, yet, if it be indispensable to that
system under which the country has been settled, and be adapted to the actual
condition of the

two people, it may, perhaps, be supported by reason, and
certainly cannot be rejected by Courts of justice. * * *

After bestowing on this subject a degree of attention which
was more required by the magnitude of the interest in litigation, and the able
and

elaborate arguments of the bar, than by its intrinsic
difficulty, the Court is decidedly of opinion, that the plaintiffs do not
exhibit a title which can

be sustained in the Courts of the United States; and that
there is no error in the judgment which was rendered against them in the
District Court

of Illinois. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .This case illustrates the practice of courts when faced
with conflicting claims to a single piece of property: They recreate the
“chains of title”

underlying the competing claims, in order to determine which
of the parties has the stronger claim. Each claim is traced back a link at a
time, until we

arrive at the “root of title.” Often this exercise will lead
back to a single common grantor (e.g., the government or the first possessor),
in which case the

first transferee from the common grantor is deemed to have
the better claim to title. If we assume the Illinois and Piankeshaw Tribes are
the common

grantor, who would prevail here—Joshua Johnson, who claims
by inheritance from Thomas Johnson, who was an original grantee from the
Piankeshaw

in 1775 , or M’Intosh, who purchases from the United States
in 1818 , which acquired the rights from the Illinois and Piankeshaw by treaty
in 1795?

2 .In order to displace the conclusion that would be drawn
from ordinary principles about transfers from a common grantor, Chief Justice
Marshall

draws a distinction between sovereign title (“dominion”)
based on discovery and Indian title (“occupancy”) based on possession. He then
traces the

chain of title back in time, looking now to acts of
discovery that establish dominion rather than occupancy. This takes him all the
way back to 1609

when Virginia was established, or perhaps even to 1497 when
Cabot

```

```

discovered North America. Who wins under the tracing-back
exercise once we recharacterize the relevant interests in this fashion? Why
does this “chain

of title” leave out France, which did not have a policy of
forbidding transactions with indigenous people and went further than English
settlers in

recognizing native property rights? What of George III’s
Proclamation of 1763 confirming native rights, which helped set the stage for
the American

Revolution?

3 .Eric Kades has called into question whether this case was
really about competing chains of title to the same land. According to Kades,
this was a

fabricated suit based on false stipulated facts: The
plaintiffs’ and the defendant’s land did not even overlap, as reflected in his
map, reproduced here as

Figure 2 - 2. Eric Kades, History and Interpretation of the
Great Case of _Johnson v. M’Intosh_ , 19 Law & Hist. Rev. 67 , 68 ( 2001 ).
The plaintiffs’

predecessors (Murray, Viviat, etc.) had tried repeatedly to
get the Virginia colonial governor and later Congress to recognize their
titles, to no avail. Nor

did the plaintiffs get “title” from all the Indians that had
some claim to the land. Eric Kades, The Dark Side of Efficiency: _Johnson v.
M’Intosh_ and the

Expropriation of American Indian Lands, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev.
1065 , 1067 , 1081 – 90 ( 2000 ). Such contrived lawsuits were not as uncommon
in those days,

though today we assume that “feigned” lawsuits do not
satisfy the “case or controversy” requirement of Article III of the
Constitution.

4 .Some of the selling tribes in _Johnson v. M’Intosh_ were
under great pressure because of declining population due to disease and
surrounding

enemy Indian tribes. The great Illinois confederation could
not defend itself against other tribes and settlers. The first two parcels in
the case, in South

and Central Illinois, were purchased from three remaining
Illinois tribes (the Kaskaskia, Peoria, and Cahokia tribes). Their numbers had
recently been

much reduced (Illinois tribes fell from 10 , 500 in 1680 to
2 , 500 in 1736 to 500 in 1800 , because of disease and Indian enemies on all
sides). The second

two parcels, in Southern Illinois and Indiana, came from the
Piankeshaw tribe, one of six Miami tribes (Miami population fell from 7 , 500
in 1682 to

some 2 , 000 in 1736 ). Kades, supra, at 1081 – 82.

5 .What is the relationship between dominion and occupancy?
How can the Indians have a present possessory interest—title of occupancy—and

the United States also have “title”? Is the right of
occupancy an interest otherwise unknown to American law, as most believe? For
an argument that

_Johnson_ and the other Marshall Court decisions on the
discovery doctrine are better interpreted as recognizing a fee simple in the
Indians subject to a

restraint on alienation and the federal government’s right
of preemption (exclusive right to purchase), see Michael C. Blumm, Why
Aboriginal Title is a

Fee Simple Absolute, 15 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 975 ( 2011
); see also Mitchel v. United States, 34 U.S. ( 9 Pet.) 711 , 756 ( 1835 )
(English king had

“ultimate reversion in fee”); see also Oneida Indian Nation
of New York v. State of New York, 691 F. 2 d 1070 , 1075 ( 2 d Cir. 1982 )
(“Thus the concept of

fee title in the context of Indian lands does not amount to
absolute ownership, but rather is used interchangeably with ‘right of
preemption,’ or the

preemptive right over all others to purchase the Indian
title or right of occupancy from the inhabitants.”), citing Oneida Indian
Nation v. County of

Oneida, 414 U.S.

```

```

661 , 670 ( 1974 ). On this alternative view, a transferee
from the United States prior to the extinguishment of Indian title would have
an executory

interest, another future interest we will take up in Chapter
V. Notice also that here as elsewhere property and sovereignty notions are
sometimes hard to

pry apart.

6 .Under either interpretation, how can the Indian right of
occupancy be extinguished? Why should “conquest” be regarded as an acceptable

method of extinguishing the right of occupancy? Does
Marshall think that the result he reaches is consistent with what morality and
international law

would dictate? What do you make of the line in the opinion,
“Conquest gives a title which the Courts of the conqueror cannot deny”? Does
this concede

too much to raw power? Or is the point rather that too many
titles to too much land depend on the validity of discovery and conquest as
means of

establishing original title to land in North America—that
the assumed validity of these methods of original acquisition has too much
gravitational force

for courts to ignore it? Either way, does this case validate
the view that property is theft? Does it at least imply that all property
ultimately flows

```



91



```

from the state, with its monopoly on the legitimate use of
force and coercion? Note that conquest was later limited by the Court to
“defensive” or “just

cause” wars. Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. ( 6 Pet.) 515 (
1832 ); see also Article III of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. Does this make
more palatable

the proposition that the Indian right of occupancy can be
extinguished by conquest? For a detailed study of the use of the discovery
doctrine in _Johnson

v. M’Intosh_ , see Lindsay G. Robertson, Conquest by Law:
How the Discovery of America Dispossessed Indigenous Peoples of their Lands (
2005 ); see

also Jedediah Purdy, Property and Empire: The Law of
Imperialism in _Johnson v. M’Intosh_ , 75 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 329 ( 2007 ). For
surveys of the

treatment of indigenous peoples’ land throughout the
English-speaking world, see, e.g., Stuart Banner, How the Indians Lost Their
Land: Law and

Power on the Frontier ( 2005 ); Kent McNeil, Common Law
Aboriginal Title ( 1989 ); Robert J. Miller et al., Discovering Indigenous
Lands: The Doctrine

of Discovery in the English Colonies ( 2010 ).

7 .One justification for the decision intimated by Chief
Justice Marshall is that the Indians had no concept of property in land
comparable to the

understanding of the white settlers. He describes “the
tribes of Indians inhabiting this country” as “fierce savages” “whose
subsistence was drawn

chiefly from the forest.” They were hunter-gatherers, who
had left the land “a wilderness.” The white settlers, in contrast, were
“agriculturists,” who

parceled out the land in private plots, causing game to flee
“into thicker and more unbroken forests” and the Indians to follow. These
views, which were

standard for the time in which Marshall lived and wrote,
have recently been called into question. According to William Cronon, for
example, New

England Indians recognized the concept of territoriality, in
the sense of areas subject to exclusive control and use by particular villages.
William Cronon,

Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of
New England 58 – 61 ( 1983 ). They also recognized individual property rights
in utilitarian

objects such as baskets, kettles, hoes, bows, arrows, and
canoes. Id. at 61. With respect to land, southern New England Indians, who
engaged in

extensive agriculture, recognized something close to
exclusive rights of particular families to fields planted with corn, although
these fields were

generally abandoned every eight years or so when soil
nutrients were exhausted. Id. at 62. Other recognized land rights were similar
to what the Romans

called usufructs—rights to engage in particular uses of
particular parcels of land. Thus, “different groups of people could have
different claims on the

same tract of land depending on how they used it. Any
village member, for instance, had the right to collect edible wild plants, cut
birchbark or chestnut

for canoes, or gather sedges for mats, wherever these things
could be found.... The same was not true, on the other hand, of hunting that
involved the

setting of snares or traps.... [Animals that had to be
caught by using traps] were best hunted by spreading the village population
over as broad a

territory as possible, and so usufruct rights had to be
designed to hold the overlap of trapped areas to a reasonable minimum.” Id. at
63 – 64. See also

Native Societies in a Modern Constitutional Democracy ( 1987 ). Similar

conclusions about aboriginal understandings of property have
been reached by other scholars. See, e.g., Stuart Banner, Two Properties, One
Land: Law

and Space in Nineteenth-Century New Zealand, 24 Law &
Soc. Inquiry 807 , 811 – 12 ( 1999 ); Robert Williams, The American Indian in
Western Legal

Thought ( 1990 ).

8 .One understanding that Indians almost surely did not
originally share with the European settlers was that of land as a commercial
commodity

subject to bargain and sale. The question of the nature of
sales by Indians to Europeans and later Americans has been the subject of much
research and

commentary. Many of the sales were fraught with
misunderstanding in the very earliest times in the eastern United States, and
with violence in later

times in the West when Indians had fewer places to which
they could retreat. See Terry L. Anderson & Peter J. Hill, The Not So Wild,
Wild West:

Property Rights on the Frontier ( 2004 ); see also Cronon,
supra, at 67 – 81.

9 .What was the ultimate impact on Native Americans of the
doctrine of discovery rationalized in _Johnson v. M’Intosh_? Commentators today
tend

to take a dim view of the decision. Kades argues that the
policy of allowing non-Indians to purchase land from Indians only with the
permission of the

United States government was disadvantageous to the Indians.
Kades, supra, at 1103 – 31. This policy, recognized in _Johnson v. M’Intosh_ ,
was originally

codified in the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790 ,
ch. 33 , 1 Stat. 137 (expired 1793 ). See also William C. Canby, Jr., The
Status of Indian Tribes

in American Law Today, 62 Wash. L. Rev. 1 , 2 – 6 ( 1987 ).
Indians could theoretically remain on the land but could not force potential
buyers to compete

with each other, thus depressing prices. A more charitable
view of the decision might ask whether Indians were likely to get a better deal
in the

nineteenth century from Congress and the federal judiciary,
or from state legislatures and state judiciaries. By distinguishing between
dominion and

occupancy, and asserting that only the federal government
could extinguish native rights of occupancy, Chief Justice Marshall—at least in
theory—

inserted the federal government and its courts as a buffer
between natives and their property interests and the land-hungry European
settlers. The federal

government, representing a more diffuse set of interests,
was arguably more even-handed in its treatment of land disputes between natives
and settlers

than state governments and state courts would have been. On
the other hand, the farther west land sales occurred, the less likely that the
federal

government could enforce its wishes. Also, Anderson and Hill
point out that members of the U.S. Army, both privates and officers, had
incentives to

drum up business by fomenting conflicts with the Indians.

10 .The potential importance of denying the states any power
to divest Indians from their lands and territory is suggested by _McGirt v.
Oklahoma_ ,

140 S. Ct. 2452 ( 2020 ). The Supreme Court, in an opinion
by Justice Gorsuch, held that Congress by treaties with the Creek Nation in the
1830 s had

established a Creek Reservation in what is now northeast
Oklahoma, including the city of Tulsa. Only Congress, he held, has the
authority to abrogate

solemn promises made to tribes in the form of a treaty, and
no subsequent Act of Congress clearly expressed an intent to eliminate the

```



93



```

reservation. Consequently, the State of Oklahoma had no
authority to try enrolled Indians for major crimes allegedly committed in the
area. Chief Justice

Roberts dissented, arguing that everyone had acted for years
as if the reservation no longer existed in its original form. This reality on
the ground, he

argued, should be controlling on the question of criminal
jurisdiction. Which opinion is more consistent with the general approach of
Chief Justice

Marshall in _Johnson v. M’Intosh_?

11 .The history of Indian land ownership after _Johnson v.
M’Intosh_ has been an unhappy one. As the nineteenth century drew on, Indians
were

forced into reservations in the West. In the Dawes General
Allotment Act of 1887 , 24 Stat. 388 , Congress allotted land to various tribes
and imposed a

version of an Anglo-American style property system, all with
the purpose of Indian assimilation. Allotted lands were to be held in trust by
the United

States and then turned over to individual Indian owners, but
placed under the jurisdiction of the state in which the land was located.
Proponents and

opponents of allotment both believed that Indians had only
common property and systematically ignored the mix of private and common
property and

the diversity of Indian property systems and their
development over time. After allotment, any changes in Indian property systems
had to be effected by

federal legislation. Various provisions of the allotment act
caused Indian land ownership to decline by 80 % by 1934 when Congress passed
the Indian

Reorganization Act. This statute promoted Indian governments
but retained much federal control and proved rigidly bureaucratic. In
_Tee-Hit-Ton Indians

v. United States_ , 348 U.S. 272 ( 1955 ), the Supreme Court
held that Congress could take Indian land without compensation. The Court again
downplayed

Indian notions of property and Indian sovereignty. At one
point the Court quoted from Justice Jackson in another case: “We agree... that
no legal rights

are today to be recognized in the Shoshones by reason of
this treaty. We agree... as to their moral deserts. We do not mean to leave the
impression that

the two have any relation to each other.” Northwestern Bands
of Shoshone Indians v. United States, 324 U.S. 335 , 358 ( 1945 ) (Jackson, J.,
concurring).

Land Grants from the Federal Public Domain*

When the original thirteen colonies broke free from Britain,
a number of them—Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Virginia, North and

South Carolina, and Georgia—had charters that included lands
extending from the Atlantic seaboard to the Mississippi River. The remaining

colonies had much more limited claims to territories along
the Atlantic coast. After much political wrangling, the states with claims to
western

lands agreed to cede those lands to the newly formed federal
government. This was the beginning of the federal public domain, a vast
quantity of

land held by the federal government for disposition and
eventual formation of new states. The original federal public domain,

#94

which extended from the Allegheny Mountains to the
Mississippi River, was soon enormously expanded. The largest augmentations were
the

Louisiana Purchase of 1803, in which the United States
acquired most of the land from Louisiana to Montana; the Treaty with Spain in
1818,

which added Florida and western Louisiana; the annexation of
Texas in 1845; the Oregon Compromise with Britain in 1846, which secured what

is now Washington, Oregon and Idaho; the concessions wrested
from Mexico in 1848 after the Mexican-American War, which included

California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and western
Colorado; and the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867. The quantity of

resources to be disposed of, once Indian title to the lands
was extinguished by treaty or conquest, was staggering—approximately 1.4
billion

acres of land.

When the western lands were ceded, the reigning idea was
that the federal government would sell the lands at auction in order to raise

money to pay off the Revolutionary War debts. To facilitate
this process, Congress (during the waning days of the Articles of
Confederation)

adopted legislation known as the Land Ordinance of 1785.
This statute probably had a more profound impact on the physical appearance of

America than any other piece of legislation before or since.
Influenced by the ideas of a committee headed by Thomas Jefferson, the
Ordinance

of 1785 mandated a system for surveying and disposing of
public domain lands. The Ordinance set up a system of principal meridians
(north-

south) and geographer’s lines (east-west) based on longitude
and latitude, creating 36-square mile townships (six miles on a side) that
would

contain one mile square numbered sections. We return to the
details of this system and the less systematic “metes and bounds” method in the

states not carved out of the public domain in Chapter VIII.

Another important provision of the Ordinance of 1785 was the
reservation of section 16 in every township “for the maintenance of public

schools within the said township.” The idea was not that all
640 acres in Section 16 would be the playground for a one-room school house

(although one can see the remains of one-room school houses
on Section 16 in many rural areas today). Rather, the territorial governments,
and

then the states formed out of the territories, would be able
to sell or lease the land in Section 16 in order to raise revenue for the
support of public

schools. Thus, the federal government, from the very
beginning, was committed to heavily subsidizing public education through the
disposition

of the public lands. This was followed by other measures,
most prominently the Morrill Act of 1862, which set aside large tracts of
public lands

for sales to support the creation of public universities—the
so-called “land grant” colleges and universities that form the backbone of much
of

our system of higher education today.

Following the Ordinance of 1785, the official policy of the
federal government continued to emphasize sales of land from the public

domain. Once Indian claims were extinguished and the land
was surveyed, it

#95

would be placed for sale at public auction. Congress set the
initial minimum price at $2 an acre, with no limitation on the amount of land
that

could be purchased. Sales were disappointing, however,
apparently because the minimum price was too high, and agitation for more
liberal

divestment policies quickly mounted. Congress responded by
easing the conditions for sales on credit. Widespread defaults and forfeitures

followed. Various relief acts were passed by Congress to
benefit those who were unable to come up with cash to pay for the lands they
had

purchased. In 1821 further credit sales were prohibited, and
the minimum price was reduced to $1.25 per acre. Forfeitures continued to
plague

those who had previously purchased on credit, and in 1832
Congress essentially gave up on further attempts to recover amounts still owed.

Federal land prices were lowered further by the Graduation
Act of 1854, which allowed for progressively lower prices for any land that did
not

sell at the minimum price.

While official federal policy continued to favor sales of
land, the reality on the ground was different. During the colonial era, many
states

outside New England had seen widespread claims of unsettled
land by squatters who moved onto choice parcels without any pretense of legal

title. As Paul W. Gates recounts:

Squatters were a rough and sometimes unruly lot. They were
contemptuous of the rights of large owners, contributed no taxes to the

support of government, and caused conflicts for colonial
administrations by their intrusions into areas claimed by the Indians. James

Logan, agent for the Penn holdings, described the
Scotch-Irish—the most restless and least law-abiding of the hordes of
immigrants

coming into Pennsylvania—as “bold and indigent strangers”
who, when challenged for their titles, replied that the Penns “had solicited

for colonists and they had come accordingly.” They took up
land in “an audacious manner,” alleging that “it was against the laws of

God and nature that so much land should be idle while so
many Christians wanted it to labor on to raise their bread.”

Gates, supra, at 66. These squatters became numerous and
vociferous enough that even before the cession of western lands to the federal

government, Virginia and North Carolina had enacted laws
allowing squatters a right of “preemption,” which essentially gave squatters an
option

to purchase the land they occupied, thereby trumping the
rights of purchasers at subsequent public-land sales.

After 1785, the practice of squatting continued,
notwithstanding the official policy of disposing of land by sale. Although the
practice was

frequently condemned, Congress received hundreds of
petitions from squatter-settlers seeking preemption rights for their holdings.
Often, but not

always, Congress responded with ad hoc legislation granting
these requests, effectively ratifying acts that had been illegal when the land
was

taken. As western interests’ political representation in
Congress

#96

increased, preemption acts became broader. The process
culminated in the enactment of the Preemption Act of 1841, which granted a
general

prospective preemption right on federal land, provided
Indian title had been extinguished and the land had been surveyed. Settlers
could claim up

to 160 acres of land before it went to public auction,
provided they inhabited and improved the land, constructed some kind of
dwelling on it, and

agreed to pay the minimum price of $1.25 per acre. There is
considerable evidence that the Preemption Act was often abused. For example,

logging companies would use dummies, persons appearing
independent but actually controlled by the company, to file preemption claims
for

timber land in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, which
provided the legal authority to enter the land. The companies would then clear
cut the

standing timber—often magnificent old-growth white pines—and
the preemption claim would be abandoned before any funds were paid to the

government. Nevertheless, preemption remained a significant
avenue for disposal of public lands until 1891, when the Preemption Act was

finally repealed.

Squatter-settlers adopted another tactic for securing legal
title to the land they had occupied: They banded together to form claims

associations. These were combinations designed to prevent
competitive bidding at public land sales, in order to ensure that local
settlers could

purchase the land of their choosing at the minimum price.
Little is known about exactly how these associations operated, since they did
not keep

written records of their activities. But it is widely
surmised that they had an even greater impact on securing land for
squatter-settlers than did the

preemption laws. Gates relates the following account:

Sandford C. Cox, an eye-witness of a government sale at the
Crawfordsville, Indiana office, wrote of the town being full of strangers

when the sales commenced [in 1825]. The eastern and southern
portions of the state were strongly represented, as well as Ohio,

Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania. There was little
competitive bidding as “the settlers, or ‘squatters’ as they are called by

speculators, have arranged matters among themselves to their
general satisfaction. If, upon comparing numbers, it appears that two are

after the same tract of land, one asks the other what he
will take not to bid against him. If neither will consent to be bought off,
they

then retire, and cast lots, and the lucky one enters the
tract at Congress’ price—$1.25 per acre—and the other enters the second choice

on his list.” If a speculator “showed a disposition to take
a settler’s claim from him, he sees the white of a score of eyes snapping at

him, and at the first opportunity he crawfishes out of the
crowd.”

Gates, supra at 152.

The most interesting legislation disposing of federal land,
in terms of its impact on the popular imagination, was the Homestead Act of

1862. This legislation grew out of a land reform movement of
      the 1830s and

#97

1840s, spearheaded by the New York newspaper publisher
Horace Greeley. Advocates argued that the government should grant free small

homesteads to any citizen who relocated westward, in order
to draw surplus labor from the cities in the East. This, they argued, would
help raise

wages for the poor who remained behind, and would act as a
“safety valve” against urban unrest. The original Act of 1862 allowed any
citizen to

claim 160 acres of unsold surveyed land. If the homesteader
inhabited the land and cultivated it for five years, he received title to the
land

without any payment (other than filing fees). Only one
homestead could be acquired per family, but it was possible to obtain 160 acres
by

homestead and another 160 by preemption—although not at the
same time, since actual inhabitation was required for each. Homesteaders could

also get title to their homestead land before five years
were up, by converting the claim to a preemption claim and paying $1.25 per
acre.

Congress eventually realized that a parcel of 160 acres was
too small to sustain productive agricultural operations in arid areas on the
Great

Plains, where there is not enough rainfall for crop
production. Later homestead acts authorized larger claims of up to 640 acres.

Although granting individual plots of land to settlers was
probably the largest single category of federal land disposal, the government

granted lands for other purposes as well. Veterans of the
Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, and the Civil War

were given “scrip” that could be exchanged for federal
lands. As previously noted, states were given Section 16 of every township to
support

public education, and were later given large grants for the
support of state colleges. Generous grants of land were also given to companies

formed to build turnpikes, canals, and railroads. Finally,
special grants of land were made to settlers who agreed to plant trees on the
prairies (the

Timber Culture Act of 1873) or to irrigate desert areas (the
Desert Land Act of 1877).

By the late nineteenth century, public attitudes toward
disposition of the public domain began to change. The process of settlement
began to

run out of gas, as remaining tracts were too arid,
mountainous, or remote to attract further private entry. The public also began
to perceive that

some of the federal land was simply too valuable to sell or
give away. The area now occupied by Yellowstone National Park was reserved from

further entry or homesteading in 1872, and reservations of
Yosemite and other future national parks followed. Huge tracts of forested land
in the

West were reserved by presidential proclamation, followed by
the creation of the National Forest System in 1897 and the National Park System

in 1916. Finally, the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 closed all
of the remaining public domain from further private entry (other than entry by

prospectors for mineral claims). Public sentiment since then
has, if anything, hardened against further private disposition of federal
lands. The

result is that today almost 30 percent of the land mass of
the United States—approximately 662 million acres—is controlled by the federal

government. These lands are managed by large federal
bureaucracies—the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and
the

National Park Service in the Department of Interior; and the
National Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .In retrospect, congressional policy toward disposition of
the public domain seems riddled with inconsistencies. Congress was at once too

generous (making grants to veterans and railroads and
favored insiders) and too stingy (setting the initial minimum price for sale at
$ 2 per acre). Part of

the problem was conflicting desires: to tap public lands as
a source of revenue in order to pay off war debts; to promote rapid development
of the interior

of the continent; to avoid sanctioning either “speculators”
or “squatters.” Two relatively consistent policies, either of which would have
promoted rapid

development, would have been to auction the land to the
highest bidder with no minimums, or to permit unlimited homesteading. Either
policy,

however, might have reduced federal revenues from initial
land sales. And the first (unlimited sales) would have had the appearance of
abetting

“speculators,” while the second (unlimited homesteading)
would have appeared to sanction

```



99



```

“squatters.” So instead, Congress vacillated back and forth
between promoting sales (subject to minimum prices) and promoting homesteading
(subject

to acreage restrictions and other limitations). Somehow, the
country got developed, although the system of disposal produced enormous
conflict and

litigation along the way.

2 .Economists have pointed out that despite the appearance
of free land, homesteading carried with it a steep price paid for by the
hardships

endured by the settlers and the concomitant premature
cultivation of remote tracts. See Terry L. Anderson & P. J. Hill, The Race
for Property Rights, 33

J.L. & Econ. 177 , 195 ( 1990 ). Again, racing behavior
if unconstrained can dissipate the value of a natural resource. On the other
hand, it has also been

argued that from the United States’ point of view,
homesteading provided collective defense of the frontier areas against
Europeans, Mexicans, and

Indians. See Douglas W. Allen, Homesteading and Property
Rights; or, “How The West Was Really Won,” 34 J.L. & Econ. 1 , 22 – 23 (
1991 ).

3 .Are preemption laws and homestead laws additional
examples of acquisition of property by first possession? By discovery? Under
both systems,

claimants would scout around until they spotted a choice
parcel of unclaimed land, which they would then occupy and claim for themselves
upon

payment of a fixed minimum price ($ 1. 25 under the
Preemption Act) or minimal filing fees (under the homestead acts). The law on
the books—the

Ordinance of 1785 and the system of land sales and
registrations managed by the Land Office—would suggest that the public domain
was divided into

well-defined parcels and distributed in a very orderly
fashion. But would it be more accurate to characterize the situation on the
ground, at least for the

first hundred years or so, as a kind of open-access commons?
If so, what does this tell us about the conditions that cause a resource to be
regarded as a

commons?

4 .What accounts for the great resistance today to further
privatization of the public domain? Many national forests, for example, could
be owned

and managed by privately-owned lumber and paper companies,
many of which already own and manage large tracts of forest lands. On one
estimate, the

National Forest System loses 25 cents on every dollar it
spends managing the National Forests. Could it be that a variety of interest
groups, including

lumber and paper companies, are happy having their
activities subsidized by federal taxpayers? See James L. Huffman, The
Inevitability of Private

Rights in Public Lands, 65 U. Colo. L. Rev. 241 ( 1994 ). Or
have past abuses of federal lands, such as the clear cutting of old-growth
forests in the upper

Midwest, created pervasive distrust of private stewardship
for resources like timber?

### C. CREATION

A third principle used to establish original ownership is
creation. This principle applies primarily to property in the form of
information.

Persons who create new information are (sometimes) rewarded
with a right to control how others use the information, and this control right
is

called intellectual property. As technological innovation
accelerates and

#100

is disseminated more quickly throughout the world, property
rights in information are becoming increasingly important to the U.S. and world

economies, and are commanding an increasing share of legal
attention and resources, compared to tangible property.

Property rights in information are different from property
rights in tangible goods in important ways. Perhaps most significantly,
although

information can be costly to produce, the marginal
post-production cost of copying or reproducing it is zero (or close to it).
Moreover, use of the

information by one consumer does not diminish the use by
another; in this sense, information is what economists call a “nonrival” good.
Thus,

the primary reason for creating property rights in
information is to provide incentives for producing and developing it, not to
assure that it is

allocated efficiently among potential users of it.

Intellectual property rights are today governed primarily by
complicated statutory regimes adopted by the U.S. Congress. The principal

regimes are patent, which applies to new, useful, and
nonobvious inventions; copyright, which applies to original works of
authorship; and

trademark, which applies to words or symbols that identify
commercial enterprises, goods, and services. It would take us too far afield to
study

any one of these statutory regimes, let alone all three, in
any detail in an introductory course in property. Instead, we will include
cases and

materials that arise out of intellectual property
controversies throughout the course where they illustrate or present problems
that are

characteristic of property rights more generally. In this
section, which deals with the principle of establishing title by creation, we
will

concentrate primarily on rights in information that have a
common-law (or equitable) basis.

#### International News Service v. Associated Press

```



Supreme Court of the United States, 1918.



248 U.S. 215.



```

■ MR.
JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court. The parties are competitors
in the gathering and distribution of news and its publication

for profit in newspapers throughout the United States. The
Associated Press, which was complainant in the District Court, is a
co-operative

organization, incorporated under the Membership Corporations
Law of the state of New York, its members being individuals who are either

proprietors or representatives of about 950 daily newspapers
published in all parts of the United States. * * * Complainant gathers in all
parts of

the world, by means of various instrumentalities of its own,
by exchange with its members, and by other appropriate means, news and

intelligence of current and recent events of interest to
newspaper readers and distributes it daily to its members for publication in
their

newspapers. The cost of the service, amounting approximately
to $3,500,000 per annum, is assessed upon the members and becomes a part of

their costs of operation, to be recouped, presumably with
profit,

#101

through the publication of their several newspapers. Under
complainant’s by-laws each member agrees upon assuming membership that news

received through complainant’s service is received
exclusively for publication in a particular newspaper, language, and place
specified in the

certificate of membership, that no other use of it shall be
permitted, and that no member shall furnish or permit any one in his employ or

connected with his newspaper to furnish any of complainant’s
news in advance of publication to any person not a member. And each member is

required to gather the local news of his district and supply
it to the Associated Press and to no one else.

Defendant is a corporation organized under the laws of the
state of New Jersey, whose business is the gathering and selling of news to its

customers and clients, consisting of newspapers published
throughout the United States, under contracts by which they pay certain amounts
at

stated times for defendant’s service. It has widespread
news-gathering agencies; the cost of its operations amounts, it is said, to
more than

$2,000,000 per annum; and it serves about 400 newspapers
located in the various cities of the United States and abroad, a few of which
are

represented, also, in the membership of the Associated
Press.

The parties are in the keenest competition between
themselves in the distribution of news throughout the United States; and so, as
a rule, are

the newspapers that they serve, in their several districts.

---

[Complainant’s] bill was filed to restrain the pirating of
complainant’s news by defendant in three ways: First, by bribing employees of

newspapers published by complainant’s members to furnish
Associated Press news to defendant before publication, for transmission by
telegraph

and telephone to defendant’s clients for publication by
them; second, by inducing Associated Press members to violate its by-laws and
permit

defendant to obtain news before publication; and, third, by
copying news from bulletin boards and from early editions of complainant’s

newspapers and selling this, either bodily or after
rewriting it, to defendant’s customers.

The District Court, upon consideration of the bill and
answer, with voluminous affidavits on both sides, granted a preliminary
injunction

under the first and second heads, but refused at that stage
to restrain the systematic practice admittedly pursued by defendant, of taking
news

bodily from the bulletin boards and early editions of
complainant’s newspapers and selling it as its own. * * *

The only matter that has been argued before us is whether
defendant may lawfully be restrained from appropriating news taken from

bulletins issued by complainant or any of its members, or
from newspapers published by them, for the purpose of selling it to defendant’s
clients.

Complainant asserts that defendant’s admitted course of
conduct in this regard both violates complainant’s property right in the news
and

constitutes unfair competition in business. And
notwithstanding the case has proceeded only to the stage of a preliminary
injunction, we have

#102

deemed it proper to consider the underlying questions, since
they go to the very merits of the action and are presented upon facts that are
not in

dispute. As presented in argument, these questions are: 1.
Whether there is any property in news; 2. Whether, if there be property in news

collected for the purpose of being published, it survives
the instant of its publication in the first newspaper to which it is
communicated by the

news-gatherer; and 3. whether defendant’s admitted course of
conduct in appropriating for commercial use matter taken from bulletins or
early

editions of Associated Press publications constitutes unfair
competition in trade.

The federal jurisdiction was invoked because of diversity of
citizenship, not upon the ground that the suit arose under the copyright or
other

laws of the United States. Complainant’s news matter is not
copyrighted. It is said that it could not, in practice, be copyrighted, because
of the

large number of dispatches that are sent daily; and,
according to complainant’s contention, news is not within the operation of the
copyright act.

---

In considering the general question of property in news
matter, it is necessary to recognize its dual character, distinguishing between
the

substance of the information and the particular form or
collocation of words in which the writer has communicated it.

No doubt news articles often possess a literary quality, and
are the subject of literary property at the common law; nor do we question that

such an article, as a literary production, is the subject of
copyright by the terms of the act as it now stands. * * *

But the news element—the information respecting current
events contained in the literary production—is not the creation of the writer,
but

is a report of matters that ordinarily are publici juris ;
it is the history of the day. It is not to be supposed that the framers of the
Constitution, when

they empowered Congress “to promote the progress of science
and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the

exclusive right to their respective writings and
discoveries” (Const. art. 1, § 8, par. 8), intended to confer upon one who
might happen to be the

first to report a historic event the exclusive right for any
period to spread the knowledge of it.

We need spend no time, however, upon the general question of
property in news matter at common law, or the application of the copyright

act, since it seems to us the case must turn upon the
question of unfair competition in business. * * * We are dealing here not with
restrictions

upon publication but with the very facilities and processes
of publication. The peculiar value of news is in the spreading of it while it
is fresh;

and it is evident that a valuable property interest in the
news, as news, cannot be maintained by keeping it secret. Besides, except for
matters

improperly disclosed, or published in breach of trust or
confidence, or in violation of law, none of which is involved in this branch of
the case,

the news of current events may be regarded as common

#103

property. What we are concerned with is the business of
making it known to the world, in which both parties to the present suit are
engaged. That

business consists in maintaining a prompt, sure, steady, and
reliable service designed to place the daily events of the world at the
breakfast table

of the millions at a price that, while of trifling moment to
each reader, is sufficient in the aggregate to afford compensation for the cost
of

gathering and distributing it, with the added profit so
necessary as an incentive to effective action in the commercial world. The
service thus

performed for newspaper readers is not only innocent but
extremely useful in itself, and indubitably constitutes a legitimate business.
The parties

are competitors in this field; and, on fundamental
principles, applicable here as elsewhere, when the rights or privileges of the
one are liable to

conflict with those of the other, each party is under a duty
so to conduct its own business as not unnecessarily or unfairly to injure that
of the

other.

Obviously, the question of what is unfair competition in
business must be determined with particular reference to the character and

circumstances of the business. The question here is not so
much the rights of either party as against the public but their rights as
between

themselves. And, although we may and do assume that neither
party has any remaining property interest as against the public in
uncopyrighted

news matter after the moment of its first publication, it by
no means follows that there is no remaining property interest in it as between

themselves. For, to both of them alike, news matter, however
little susceptible of ownership or dominion in the absolute sense, is stock in
trade,

to be gathered at the cost of enterprise, organization,
skill, labor, and money, and to be distributed and sold to those who will pay
money for it, as

for any other merchandise. Regarding the news, therefore, as
but the material out of which both parties are seeking to make profits at the
same

time and in the same field, we hardly can fail to recognize
that for this purpose, and as between them, it must be regarded as quasi
property,

irrespective of the rights of either as against the public.

In order to sustain the jurisdiction of equity over the
controversy, we need not affirm any general and absolute property in the news
as such.

The rule that a court of equity concerns itself only in the
protection of property rights treats any civil right of a pecuniary nature as a
property

right (In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 210 (1888); In re Debs,
158 U.S. 564, 593 (1895)); and the right to acquire property by honest labor or
the

conduct of a lawful business is as much entitled to
protection as the right to guard property already acquired (Truax v. Raich, 239
U.S. 33, 37–38

(1916); Brennan v. United Hatters, 65 Atl. 165, 171–72 (N.J.
1906); Barr v. Essex Trades Council, 30 Atl. 881 (N.J. Ch. 1894)). It is this
right

that furnishes the basis of the jurisdiction in the ordinary
case of unfair competition. * * *

The peculiar features of the case arise from the fact that,
while novelty and freshness form so important an element in the success of the

#104

business, the very processes of distribution and publication
necessarily occupy a good deal of time. Complainant’s service, as well as

defendant’s, is a daily service to daily newspapers; most of
the foreign news reaches this country at the Atlantic seaboard, principally at
the city

of New York, and because of this, and of time differentials
due to the earth’s rotation, the distribution of news matter throughout the
country is

principally from east to west; and, since in speed the
telegraph and telephone easily outstrip the rotation of the earth, it is a
simple matter for

defendant to take complainant’s news from bulletins or early
editions of complainant’s members in the eastern cities and at the mere cost of

telegraphic transmission cause it to be published in western
papers issued at least as early as those served by complainant. Besides this,
and

irrespective of time differentials, irregularities in
telegraphic transmission on different lines, and the normal consumption of time
in printing and

distributing the newspaper, result in permitting pirated
news to be placed in the hands of defendant’s readers sometimes simultaneously
with the

service of competing Associated Press papers, occasionally
even earlier.

Defendant insists that when, with the sanction and approval
of complainant, and as the result of the use of its news for the very purpose
for

which it is distributed, a portion of complainant’s members
communicate it to the general public by posting it upon bulletin boards so that
all

may read, or by issuing it to newspapers and distributing it
indiscriminately, complainant no longer has the right to control the use to be
made of

it; that when it thus reaches the light of day it becomes
the common possession of all to whom it is accessible; and that any purchaser
of a

newspaper has the right to communicate the intelligence
which it contains to anybody and for any purpose, even for the purpose of
selling it for

profit to newspapers published for profit in competition
with complainant’s members.

The fault in the reasoning lies in applying as a test the
right of the complainant as against the public, instead of considering the
rights of

complainant and defendant, competitors in business, as
between themselves. The right of the purchaser of a single newspaper to spread

knowledge of its contents gratuitously, for any legitimate
purpose not unreasonably interfering with complainant’s right to make
merchandise of

it, may be admitted; but to transmit that news for
commercial use, in competition with complainant—which is what defendant has
done and seeks

to justify—is a very different matter. In doing this
defendant, by its very act, admits that it is taking material that has been
acquired by

complainant as the result of organization and the
expenditure of labor, skill, and money, and which is salable by complainant for
money, and that

defendant in appropriating it and selling it as its own is
endeavoring to reap where it has not sown, and by disposing of it to newspapers
that are

competitors of complainant’s members is appropriating to
itself the harvest of those who have sown. Stripped of all disguises, the
process

amounts to an unauthorized interference with the normal
operation of

#105

complainant’s legitimate business precisely at the point
where the profit is to be reaped, in order to divert a material portion of the
profit from

those who have earned it to those who have not; with special
advantage to defendant in the competition because of the fact that it is not
burdened

with any part of the expense of gathering the news. The
transaction speaks for itself and a court of equity ought not to hesitate long
in

characterizing it as unfair competition in business. * * *

It is no answer to say that complainant spends its money for
that which is too fugitive or evanescent to be the subject of property. That

might, and for the purposes of the discussion we are
assuming that it would furnish an answer in a common-law controversy. But in a
court of

equity, where the question is one of unfair competition, if
that which complainant has acquired fairly at substantial cost may be sold
fairly at

substantial profit, a competitor who is misappropriating it
for the purpose of disposing of it to his own profit and to the disadvantage of

complainant cannot be heard to say that it is too fugitive
or evanescent to be regarded as property. It has all the attributes of property
necessary

for determining that a misappropriation of it by a
competitor is unfair competition because contrary to good conscience. * * *

* * * Indeed, it is one of the most obvious results of
      defendant’s theory that, by permitting indiscriminate publication by anybody
      and

everybody for purposes of profit in competition with the
news-gatherer, it would render publication profitless, or so little profitable
as in effect to

cut off the service by rendering the cost prohibitive in
comparison with the return. * * *

It is to be observed that the view we adopt does not result
in giving to complainant the right to monopolize either the gathering or the

distribution of the news, or, without complying with the
copyright act, to prevent the reproduction of its news articles, but only
postpones

participation by complainant’s competitor in the processes
of distribution and reproduction of news that it has not gathered, and only to
the extent

necessary to prevent that competitor from reaping the fruits
of complainant’s efforts and expenditure, to the partial exclusion of
complainant, and

in violation of the principle that underlies the maxim sic
utere tuo , etc.

It is said that the elements of unfair competition are
lacking because there is no attempt by defendant to palm off its goods as those
of the

complainant, characteristic of the most familiar, if not the
most typical, cases of unfair competition. But we cannot concede that the right
to

equitable relief is confined to that class of cases. In the
present case the fraud upon complainant’s rights is more direct and obvious.
Regarding

news matter as the mere material from which these two
competing parties are endeavoring to make money, and treating it, therefore, as
quasi

property for the purposes of their business because they are
both selling it as such, defendant’s conduct differs from the ordinary case of
unfair

competition in trade principally in this that, instead of
selling its

#106

own goods as those of complainant, it substitutes
misappropriation in the place of misrepresentation, and sells complainant’s
goods as its own.

Besides the misappropriation, there are elements of
imitation, of false pretense, in defendant’s practices. The device of rewriting

complainant’s news articles, frequently resorted to, carries
its own comment. The habitual failure to give credit to complainant for that
which is

taken is significant. Indeed, the entire system of
appropriating complainant’s news and transmitting it as a commercial product to
defendant’s

clients and patrons amounts to a false representation to
them and to their newspaper readers that the news transmitted is the result of
defendant’s

own investigation in the field. But these elements, although
accentuating the wrong, are not the essence of it. It is something more than
the

advantage of celebrity of which complainant is being
deprived. * * *

■ MR.
JUSTICE HOLMES, dissenting. When an uncopyrighted combination of words is
published there is no general right to forbid other people

repeating them—in other words there is no property in the
combination or in the thoughts or facts that the words express. Property, a
creation of

law, does not arise from value, although exchangeable—a
matter of fact. Many exchangeable values may be destroyed intentionally without

compensation. Property depends upon exclusion by law from
interference, and a person is not excluded from using any combination of words

merely because some one has used it before, even if it took
labor and genius to make it. If a given person is to be prohibited from making
the use

of words that his neighbors are free to make[,] some other
ground must be found. One such ground is vaguely expressed in the phrase fair
trade.

This means that the words are repeated by a competitor in
business in such a way as to convey a misrepresentation that materially injures
the

person who first used them, by appropriating credit of some
kind which the first user has earned. The ordinary case * * * is palming off
the

defendant’s product as the plaintiff’s but the same evil may
follow from the opposite falsehood—from saying whether in words or by
implication

that the plaintiff’s product is the defendant’s, and that,
it seems to me, is what has happened here. * * *

[I]n my view, the only ground of complaint that can be
recognized without legislation is the implied misstatement[.] [I]t can be
corrected by

stating the truth; and a suitable acknowledgement of the
source is all that the plaintiff can require. I think that within the limits
recognized by the

decision of the Court the defendant should be enjoined from
publishing news obtained from the Associated Press for [___] hours after

publication by the plaintiff unless it gives express credit
to the Associated Press; the number of hours and the form of acknowledgment to
be

settled by the District Court.

■ MR.
JUSTICE BRANDEIS, dissenting. * * * The sole question for our consideration is
this: Was the International News Service properly enjoined

from using, or causing to be used gainfully, news of which
it

#107

acquired knowledge by lawful means (namely, by reading
publicly posted bulletins or papers purchased by it in the open market) merely
because

the news had been originally gathered by the Associated
Press and continued to be of value to some of its members, or because it did
not reveal

the source from which it was acquired? * * *

News is a report of recent occurrences. The business of the
news agency is to gather systematically knowledge of such occurrences of

interest and to distribute reports thereof. The Associated
Press contended that knowledge so acquired is property, because it costs money
and

labor to produce and because it has value for which those
who have it not are ready to pay; that it remains property and is entitled to
protection as

long as it has commercial value as news; and that to protect
it effectively, the defendant must be enjoined from making, or causing to be
made,

any gainful use of it while it retains such value. An
essential element of individual property is the legal right to exclude others
from enjoying it. If

the property is private, the right of exclusion may be
absolute; if the property is affected with a public interest, the right of
exclusion is qualified.

But the fact that a product of the mind has cost its
producer money and labor, and has a value for which others are willing to pay,
is not sufficient

to ensure to it this legal attribute of property. The
general rule of law is, that the noblest of human productions—knowledge, truths
ascertained,

conceptions, and ideas—became, after voluntary communication
to others, free as the air to common use. Upon these incorporeal productions
the

attribute of property is continued after such communication
only in certain classes of cases where public policy has seemed to demand it.
These

exceptions are confined to productions which, in some
degree, involve creation, invention, or discovery. But by no means all such are
endowed

with this attribute of property. The creations which are
recognized as property by the common law are literary, dramatic, musical, and
other

artistic creations; and these have also protection under the
copyright statutes. The inventions and discoveries upon which this attribute of

property is conferred only by statute, are the few comprised
within the patent law. There are also many other cases in which courts
interfere to

prevent curtailment of plaintiff’s enjoyment of incorporeal
productions; and in which the right to relief is often called a property right,
but is such

only in a special sense. In those cases, the plaintiff has
no absolute right to the protection of his production; he has merely the
qualified right to

be protected as against the defendant’s acts, because of the
special relation in which the latter stands or the wrongful method or means
employed

in acquiring the knowledge or the manner in which it is
used. Protection of this character is afforded where the suit is based upon
breach of

contract or of trust or upon unfair competition.

The knowledge for which protection is sought in the case at
bar is not of a kind upon which the law has heretofore conferred the attributes

of property; nor is the manner of its acquisition or use nor
the purpose to

#108

which it is applied, such as has heretofore been recognized
as entitling a plaintiff to relief. * * *

[T]he plaintiff does not contend that the posting was
wrongful or that any papers were wrongfully issued by its subscribers. On the
contrary

it is conceded that both the bulletins and the papers were
issued in accordance with the regulations of the plaintiff. Under such
circumstances, for

a reader of the papers purchased in the open market, or a
reader of the bulletins publicly posted, to procure and use gainfully,
information therein

contained, does not involve inducing any one to commit a
breach either of contract or of trust, or committing or in any way abetting a
breach of

confidence. * * *

Plaintiff further contended that defendant’s practice
constitutes unfair competition, because there is “appropriation without cost to
itself of

values created by” the plaintiff; and it is upon this ground
that the decision of this court appears to be based. To appropriate and use for
profit,

knowledge and ideas produced by other men, without making
compensation or even acknowledgment, may be inconsistent with a finer sense of

propriety; but, with the exceptions indicated above, the law
has heretofore sanctioned the practice. Thus it was held that one may
ordinarily make

and sell anything in any form, may copy with exactness that
which another has produced, or may otherwise use his ideas without his consent
and

without the payment of compensation, and yet not inflict a
legal injury; and that ordinarily one is at perfect liberty to find out, if he
can by lawful

means, trade secrets of another, however valuable, and then
use the knowledge so acquired gainfully, although it cost the original owner
much in

effort and in money to collect or produce.

Such taking and gainful use of a product of another which,
for reasons of public policy, the law has refused to endow with the attributes
of

property, does not become unlawful because the product
happens to have been taken from a rival and is used in competition with him.
The

unfairness in competition which hitherto has been recognized
by the law as a basis for relief, lay in the manner or means of conducting the

business; and the manner or means held legally unfair,
involves either fraud or force or the doing of acts otherwise prohibited by
law. In the

“passing off” cases (the typical and most common case of
unfair competition), the wrong consists in fraudulently representing by word or
act that

defendant’s goods are those of plaintiff. In the other
cases, the diversion of trade was effected through physical or moral coercion,
or by inducing

breaches of contract or of trust or by enticing away
employees. In some others, called cases of simulated competition, relief was
granted because

defendant’s purpose was unlawful; namely, not competition
but deliberate and wanton destruction of plaintiff’s business.

That competition is not unfair in a legal sense, merely
because the profits gained are unearned, even if made at the expense of a
rival, is

shown by many cases besides those referred to above. He who
follows the pioneer into a new market, or who engages in the manufacture of an

#109

article newly introduced by another, seeks profits due
largely to the labor and expense of the first adventurer; but the law
sanctions, indeed

encourages, the pursuit. * * *

The great development of agencies now furnishing
country-wide distribution of news, the vastness of our territory, and
improvements in the

means of transmitting intelligence, have made it possible
for a news agency or newspapers to obtain, without paying compensation, the
fruit of

another’s efforts and to use news so obtained gainfully in
competition with the original collector. The injustice of such action is
obvious. But to

give relief against it would involve more than the
application of existing rules of law to new facts. It would require the making
of a new rule in

analogy to existing ones. The unwritten law possesses
capacity for growth; and has often satisfied new demands for justice by
invoking analogies

or by expanding a rule or principle. This process has been
in the main wisely applied and should not be discontinued. Where the problem is

relatively simple, as it is apt to be when private interests
only are involved, it generally proves adequate. But with the increasing
complexity of

society, the public interest tends to become omnipresent;
and the problems presented by new demands for justice cease to be simple. Then
the

creation or recognition by courts of a new private right may
work serious injury to the general public, unless the boundaries of the right
are

definitely established and wisely guarded. In order to
reconcile the new private right with the public interest, it may be necessary
to prescribe

limitations and rules for its enjoyment; and also to provide
administrative machinery for enforcing the rules. It is largely for this reason
that, in

the effort to meet the many new demands for justice incident
to a rapidly changing civilization, resort to legislation has latterly been had
with

increasing frequency.

The rule for which the plaintiff contends would effect an
important extension of property rights and a corresponding curtailment of the
free

use of knowledge and of ideas; and the facts of this case
admonish us of the danger involved in recognizing such a property right in
news,

without imposing upon news-gatherers corresponding
obligations. A large majority of the newspapers and perhaps half the newspaper
readers of

the United States are dependent for their news of general
interest upon agencies other than the Associated Press. The channel through
which

about 400 of these papers received, as the plaintiff
alleges, “a large amount of news relating to the European war of the greatest
importance and

of intense interest to the newspaper reading public” was
suddenly closed. The closing to the International News Service of these
channels for

foreign news (if they were closed) was due not to
unwillingness on its part to pay the cost of collecting the news, but to the
prohibitions imposed

by foreign governments upon its securing news from their
respective countries and from using cable or telegraph lines running therefrom.
For

aught that appears, this prohibition may have been wholly
undeserved; and at all events the 400 papers and their readers may be assumed
to

#110

have been innocent. For aught that appears, the
International News Service may have sought then to secure temporarily by
arrangement with the

Associated Press the latter’s foreign news service. For
aught that appears, all of the 400 subscribers of the International News
Service would

gladly have then become members of the Associated Press, if
they could have secured election thereto. It is possible, also, that a large
part of the

readers of these papers were so situated that they could not
secure prompt access to papers served by the Associated Press. The prohibition
of the

foreign governments might as well have been extended to the
channels through which news was supplied to the more than a thousand other
daily

papers in the United States not served by the Associated
Press; and a large part of their readers may also be so located that they
cannot procure

prompt access to papers served by the Associated Press.

A Legislature, urged to enact a law by which one news agency
or newspaper may prevent appropriation of the fruits of its labors by another,

would consider such facts and possibilities and others which
appropriate inquiry might disclose. Legislators might conclude that it was

impossible to put an end to the obvious injustice involved
in such appropriation of news, without opening the door to other evils, greater
than that

sought to be remedied. * * *

Courts are ill-equipped to make the investigations which
should precede a determination of the limitations which should be set upon any

property right in news or of the circumstances under which
news gathered by a private agency should be deemed affected with a public
interest.

Courts would be powerless to prescribe the detailed
regulations essential to full enjoyment of the rights conferred or to introduce
the machinery

required for enforcement of such regulations. Considerations
such as these should lead us to decline to establish a new rule of law in the
effort to

redress a newly disclosed wrong, although the propriety of
some remedy appears to be clear.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The majority says that in order to sustain the
injunction, “we need not affirm any general and absolute property in the news
as such.” Do you

agree? Does the principle that underlies the injunction
establish an in personam right running against one entity (International News)
in favor of another

(Associated Press)? Or is it a more general right in rem
that binds all the world? Whatever the Supreme Court thought it was doing,
lower courts have

relied on the decision to create what amounts to a
common-law right to exclude others from time-sensitive information that the
plaintiff has produced

with some effort. See, e.g., National Basketball Ass’n v.
Motorola, Inc., 105 F. 3 d 841 ( 2 d Cir. 1997 ); Board of Trade of Chicago v.
Dow Jones & Co.,

456 N.E. 2 d 84 (Ill. 1983 ). Recently, news organizations,
including the Associated Press, have sued “aggregators,” websites that
summarize information

from other sites. See, e.g., Barclays Capital v.
Theflyonthewall.com, 650 F. 3 d 876 ( 2 d Cir. 2011 ) (reversing grant of
injunction for news organization

claiming misappropriation, because news

```



111



```

aggregator was not “free-riding”); see also Associated Press
v. All Headline News Corp., 608 F. Supp. 2 d 454 (S.D.N.Y. 2009 ) (denying
motion to

dismiss hot news misappropriation claim). How, if at all,
should the hot news doctrine or misappropriation apply to Internet news
aggregators? To

collectors of “hot data”? See Victoria Smith Ekstrand &
Christopher Roush, From “Hot News” to “Hot Data”: The Rise of “Fintech,” the
Ownership of

Big Data, and the Future of the Hot News Doctrine, 35
Cardozo Arts & Ent. L.J. 303 , 304 ( 2017 ).

2. _International News_ is a leading judicial
   statement—perhaps _the_ leading statement—of the idea that property rights
   should be based on desert,

that one should not be allowed to reap where another has
sown. This is generally associated with John Locke’s labor theory of property,
briefly

described in the fourth note after _Pierson v. Post_ , as
opposed to theories based on utility, autonomy, or personhood. Scholars and
judges, however, are

deeply divided over the foundational principle of
intellectual property rights. Are such rights based on protection of the labor
and desert of those who

create—artists, inventors, or gatherers of hot news? Or are
they grounded in the social utility created by providing incentives designed to
stimulate the

production of new and valuable works, inventions, and
information? Compare Douglas G. Baird, Common Law Intellectual Property and the
Legacy of

_International News Service v. Associated Press_ , 50 U.
Chi. L. Rev. 411 ( 1983 ) (arguing that the law provides for no general
reap-what-you-sow

principle) with Wendy J. Gordon, On Owning Information:
Intellectual Property and the Restitutionary Impulse, 78 Va. L. Rev. 149 ( 1992
) (arguing that

intellectual property is consistent with principles behind
the law of restitution).

3 .Is _International News_ an application of the principle
of unfair competition, recognized in _Keeble v. Hickeringill_ , supra? What
about unfair

competition makes it inequitable? See, e.g., Shyamkrishna
Balganesh, “Hot News”: The Enduring Myth of Property in News, 111 Colum. L.
Rev. 419

( 2011 ) (unfair competition and restitution); Henry E.
Smith, Equitable Intellectual Property: What’s Wrong with Misappropriation?,
Intellectual Property

and the Common Law 42 (Shyamkrishna Balganesh ed., 2013 )
(unfair competition and equity). (For further consideration of the idea of
restitution for

unjust enrichment, see Chapter IV.C.)

4 .Why couldn’t the Associated Press solve its problem by
copyright? Under the 1909 Copyright Act in effect when the _International News_
case

arose, certain notice-giving formalities were required
(“Copyright” or an abbreviation and the name of the copyright holder in
prescribed places) as well

as registration at the Copyright Office. The Associated
Press could not comply with the registration requirements before the newspapers
were

distributed. Since the March 1 , 1989 effective date of the
U.S. ratification of the Berne Convention in 1988 , no notice is required for
protection of

original works. Hence, at least insofar as the International
News Service was copying the text of AP stories (as opposed to reporting on the
information

they contained), the problem in _International News_ could
be solved by copyright protection today. The formalities are still relevant,
but only because

they confer certain evidentiary advantages. See 17 U.S.C. §
401 (d). Registration

```



112



```

is not required but likewise confers certain advantages. Id.
§ 412. Copyright is also relevant in that a broad version of misappropriation
grounded in state

law (which is where much of unfair competition law now
resides) that started to look too much like copyright law would be preempted by
the federal

copyright statute. 17 U.S.C. § 106.

5 .Another cluster of issues in the _International News_
case centers on the role of custom. What if it were true that news
organizations had a custom

of respecting each other’s claims to hot news? Should a
court then enforce this custom? For an argument in the affirmative, see Richard
A. Epstein,

_International News Service v. Associated Press_ : Custom
and Law as Sources of Property Rights in News, 78 Va. L. Rev. 85 ( 1992 ).
There has been an

outpouring of studies of customary regimes of intellectual
property rights in specialized communities, including French chefs, Emmanuelle
Fauchart &

Eric von Hippel, Norm-Based Intellectual Property Systems:
The Case of French Chefs, 19 Org. Sci. 187 ( 2008 ), and stand-up comics, Dotan
Oliar &

Christopher Sprigman, There’s No Free Laugh (Anymore): The
Emergence of Intellectual Property Norms and the Transformation of Stand-Up

Comedy, 94 Va. L. Rev. 1787 ( 2008 ). This literature has
generally been fairly upbeat about extra-legal IP norms, except for the
potential for violence

(among the comics, not the chefs). Others are not as
enthusiastic, particularly where custom tends to increase intellectual property
protection. Jennifer E.

Rothman, The Questionable Use of Custom in Intellectual
Property, 93 Va. L. Rev. 1899 ( 2007 ).

6 .A final issue of importance concerns which institution in
society—the courts or the legislature—should decide whether to provide legal

protection against misappropriation of hot news. The issue
is especially important for intellectual property, but applies in principle to
any question about

whether to create a new type of property right. Justice
Brandeis gives some reasons for preferring the legislature to make these sorts
of decisions. What

might be the arguments in favor of allowing courts to make
the decision (subject, presumably, to revision by the legislature)? For general
discussion of

the criteria for choosing between courts and legislatures in
resolving social policy questions, see Neil K. Komesar, Imperfect Alternatives:
Choosing

Institutions in Law, Economics, and Public Policy ( 1994 ).
For discussion focused on which institution should recognize new property
rights, see Thomas

W. Merrill & Henry E. Smith, Optimal Standardization in
the Law of Property: The _Numerus Clausus_ Principle, 110 Yale L.J. 1 , 58 – 68
( 2000 ).

7 .Creation, like discovery, bears a degree of similarity to
first possession, in that being _first_ is important to all three general
principles of original

acquisition. In keeping with misappropriation not creating a
full-blown property right, the firstness here does not require a showing of
much originality,

at least beyond news value. Creation often requires more,
some kind of novelty. Patent law even requires that inventions be nonobvious in
order to be

patentable:

```



A patent for a claimed invention may not be obtained * * *
if the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art are such



that the claimed invention as a whole would have been



```

```



113



```

```



obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed
invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed
invention



pertains. Patentability shall not be negated by the manner
in which the invention was made.



```

35 U.S.C. § 103.

### D. PRIOR POSSESSION

Possession is more than a method of original acquisition.
Possession is arguably the most basic property institution. Is possession a
fact—

control over the resource coupled perhaps with an intent to
maintain control? Norms of mutual recognition of possessory claims in household

implements, foodstuffs, and other everyday objects probably
arose deep in prehistory. And claims to territory on small scales bear some

resemblance to animal territoriality. At some point law got
involved. As you will see, the law’s treatment of possession is quite
many-sided, from

affording protection to plaintiffs in possession, to
vindicating a right to possess, to easing the path for possessors to prove
ownership. So keep

asking yourself in the cases that follow: What does it mean
to “possess” something? When and why will the law intervene to protect this

possession?

### 1 .RIGHTS TO POSSESS

We sometimes speak of “rights” of possession. Consider the
following case.

#### Haslem v. Lockwood

```



Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut, 1871.



37 Conn. 500 , 9 Am. Rep. 350.



```

Trover, for a quantity of manure[.] * * * On the trial it
was proved that the plaintiff employed two men to gather into heaps, on the
evening

of April 6th, 1869, some manure that lay scattered along the
side of a public highway, for several rods, in the borough of Stamford,
intending to

remove the same to his own land the next evening. The men
began to scrape the manure into heaps at six o’clock in the evening, and after

gathering eighteen heaps, or about six cart loads, left the
same at eight o’clock in the evening in the street. The heaps consisted chiefly
of manure

made by horses hitched to the railing of the public park in,
and belonging to, the borough of Stamford, and was all gathered between the
center of

the highway and the park; the rest of the heaps consisting
of dirt, straw and the ordinary scrapings of highways. The defendant on the
next

morning, seeing the heaps, endeavored without success to
ascertain who had made them, and inquired of the warden of the borough if he
had

given permission to any one to remove them, and ascertained
from him that he had not. He thereupon, before noon on that day, removed the

#114

heaps, and also the rest of the manure scattered along the
side of the highway adjacent to the park, to his own land.

The plaintiff and defendant both claimed to have received
authority from the warden to remove the manure before the 6th of April, but in

fact neither had any legal authority from the warden, or
from any officer of the borough or of the town. The borough of Stamford was the
sole

adjoining proprietor of the land on which the manure lay
scattered before it was gathered by the plaintiff. No notice was left on the
heaps or near

by, by the plaintiff or his workmen, to indicate who had
gathered them, nor had the plaintiff or his workmen any actual possession of
the heaps

after eight o’clock in the evening on the 6th of April.

Neither the plaintiff while gathering, nor the defendant
while removing the heaps, was interfered with or opposed by any one. The
removal

of the manure and scrapings was calculated to improve the
appearance and health of the borough. The six loads were worth one dollar per
load.

The plaintiff, on ascertaining that the defendant had
removed the manure, demanded payment for the same, which the defendant refused.
Neither

the plaintiff nor defendant owned any land adjacent to the
place where the manure lay. The highway was kept in repair by the town of
Stamford.

On the above facts the plaintiff claimed, and prayed the
court to rule, that the manure was personal property which had been abandoned
by

its owners and became by such abandonment the property of
the first person who should take possession of the same, which the plaintiff
had

done by gathering it into heaps, and that it was not and
never had been a part of the real estate of the borough or of any one else who
might be

regarded as owning the fee of the soil. He further claimed
that if it was a part of the real estate, it was taken without committing a
trespass, and

with the tacit consent of the owners of such real estate,
and that thereby it became his personal property of which he was lawfully
possessed, and

at least that he had acquired such an interest in it as
would enable him to hold it against any person except the owner of the land or
some person

claiming under the owner.

The defendant * * * claimed, as matter of law, that if the
manure was always personal estate, or became personal estate after being
scraped

up into heaps, the plaintiff, by leaving it from eight
o’clock in the evening until noon the next day, abandoned all right of
possession which he

might have had, and could not, therefore, maintain his
action.

The court ruled adversely to the claims of the plaintiff and
held that on the facts proved the plaintiff had not made out a sufficient
interest in,

or right of possession to, the subject matter in dispute, to
authorize a recovery in the suit, and rendered judgment for the defendant.

The plaintiff moved for a new trial for error in this ruling
of the court.

■ PARK,
J. * * * The manure originally belonged to the travelers whose animals dropped
it, but it being worthless to them was immediately

#115

abandoned; and whether it then became the property of the
borough of Stamford which owned the fee of the land on which the manure lay, it
is

unnecessary to determine; for, if it did, * * * the removal
of the filth would be an improvement to the borough, and no objection was made
by

any one to the use that the plaintiff attempted to make of
it. Considering the character of such accumulations upon highways in cities and

villages, and the light in which they are everywhere
regarded in closely settled communities, we cannot believe that the borough in
this instance

would have had any objection to the act of the plaintiff in
removing a nuisance that affected the public health and the appearance of the
streets.

At all events, we think the facts of the case show a
sufficient right in the plaintiff to the immediate possession of the property
as against a mere

wrong doer.

The defendant appears before the court in no enviable light.
He does not pretend that he had a right to the manure, even when scattered upon

the highway, superior to that of the plaintiff; but after
the plaintiff had changed its original condition and greatly enhanced its value
by his labor,

he seized and appropriated to his own use the fruits of the
plaintiff’s outlay, and now seeks immunity from responsibility on the ground
that the

plaintiff was a wrong doer as well as himself. The conduct
of the defendant is in keeping with his claim, and neither commends itself to
the

favorable consideration of the court. The plaintiff had the
peaceable and quiet possession of the property; and we deem this sufficient
until the

borough of Stamford shall make complaint.

It is further claimed that if the plaintiff had a right to
the property by virtue of occupancy, he lost the right when he ceased to retain
the

actual possession of the manure after scraping it into
heaps.

We do not question the general doctrine, that where the
right by occupancy exists, it exists no longer than the party retains the
actual

possession of the property, or till he appropriates it to
his own use by removing it to some other place. If he leaves the property at
the place where

it was discovered, and does nothing whatsoever to enhance
its value or change its nature, his right by occupancy is unquestionably gone.
But the

question is, if a party finds property comparatively
worthless, as the plaintiff found the property in question, owing to its
scattered condition upon

the highway, and greatly increases its value by his labor
and expense, does he lose his right if he leaves it a reasonable time to
procure the means

to take it away, when such means are necessary for its
removal?

Suppose a teamster with a load of grain, while traveling the
highway, discovers a rent in one of his bags, and finds that his grain is
scattered

upon the road for the distance of a mile. He considers the
labor of collecting his corn of more value than the property itself, and he
therefore

abandons it, and pursues his way. A afterwards finds the
grain in this condition and gathers it kernel by kernel into heaps by the side
of the road,

and leaves it a reasonable time to procure the means
necessary

#116

for its removal. While he is gone for his bag, B discovers
the grain thus conveniently collected in heaps and appropriates it to his own
use. Has A

any remedy? If he has not, the law in this instance is open
to just reproach. We think under such circumstances A would have a reasonable
time to

remove the property, and during such reasonable time his
right to it would be protected. If this is so, then the principle applies to
the case under

consideration.

A reasonable time for the removal of this manure had not
elapsed when the defendant seized and converted it to his own use. The statute

regulating the rights of parties in the gathering of sea
weed, gives the party who heaps it upon a public beach twenty four hours in
which to

remove it, and that length of time for the removal of the
property we think would not be unreasonable in most cases like the present one.

We therefore advise the Court of Common Pleas to grant a new
trial.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Both the trial court and the appeals court appear to
accept that the plaintiff (and his workers) did not have “actual possession” of
the manure

after 8 : 00 pm on April 6. What then is the correct
description of the plaintiff’s relationship to the manure after that, which
entitles the plaintiff to

judgment against the defendant? Is the plaintiff still in
“possession” in some sense, although not in “actual” possession? What
additional acts would the

plaintiff have to perform to be deemed to be in actual
possession of the manure?

2 .Should rights of possession to things be limited to those
who maintain actual possession of those things? Suppose the plaintiff is
standing guard

over the manure, and the defendant takes the manure while
the plaintiff is looking the other way. Can the defendant now defeat the
plaintiff’s claim by

pointing out that the defendant is now the one in actual
possession? As we will see in Chapter IV, the law of larceny and the tort of
conversion protect

persons in possession of things, but almost invariably the
person in actual possession is the one who had taken the thing without the
consent of the

person previously deemed to be in possession. Does this
suggest that “possession” must mean something other than actual possession?

3 .Does raking the manure into piles make the plaintiff now
the “owner” of the manure? Suppose the city of Stamford has a street sweeper
who

comes along at 9 : 00 pm and sweeps the manure into a cart
to take to the city dump. Would the plaintiff have a claim against the city for
taking “his”

manure?

4 .How important is it to the court’s judgment that the
plaintiff (or his workers) expended labor in putting the manure into piles?
Should the result

be different if the plaintiff expended no labor, for example
if a valuable piece of fruit fell off a tree into the plaintiff’s wagon, which
he left overnight to

retrieve the next day? What if the defendant could show that
lifting the piles into a conveyance and carrying them to the defendant’s
property entailed

```



117



```

more labor than that expended by the plaintiff in gathering
the manure into piles?

5 .Suppose the plaintiff did not gather the manure into
piles but had posted a sign on the fence in front of the street, “I hereby
claim the manure

lying about in the street as my own and will come tomorrow
to collect it.” Would the plaintiff be entitled to recover against the
defendant on these facts,

if the defendant came and collected the manure first?

6 .In a part of the opinion not reproduced here, the court
considers and dismisses the possibility that the manure was part of the real
estate, in this

case the public highway. In other contexts, namely farms,
manure was considered part of the realty for the reason that the manure and the
land were

highly complementary. In other words, manure is part of the
land in the one case and not the other, based on practical considerations
reflected in

accepted customs. Is there any problem signaling to
potential appropriators which manure is up for grabs and which isn’t?

7 .The character of possession in law reflects its origins
in everyday life. What counts as possession draws heavily on customs and social
norms.

The tendency to gravitate to possession to solve problems of
conflict and the ease and quickness of signals of possession are well suited
for something

that people need to apply on the fly. Possession is also
correspondingly a cheap method of assessing claims, unlike elaborate systems of
proving title we

will see later on. For commentary on these and many other
issues, see the volume Law and Economics of Possession (Yun-Chien Chang ed.,
2015 ).

### 2 .SEQUENTIAL POSSESSION ISSUES

What happens if multiple persons serially claim property on
some theory other than purchase or gift from the prior owner? This rarely

happens, but when it does, it brings out a fundamental
proposition about the system of property rights, sometimes called the
relativity of title and

sometimes referred to as the rejection of the jus tertii
defense—a defense based on the rights of third parties. Property rights may be
good against

all the world, but disputes over property usually take the
form A v. B, and courts usually ask only as between A and B who has the
superior title.

#### Armory v. Delamirie

```



King’s Bench, 1722.



1 Strange 505 , 93 Eng. Rep. 664.



```

The plaintiff being a chimney sweeper’s boy found a jewel
and carried it to the defendant’s shop (who was a goldsmith) to know what it

was, and delivered it into the hands of the apprentice, who
under the pretense of weighing it, took out the stones, and calling to the
master to let

him know it came to three halfpence, the master offered the
boy the money, who refused to take it, and insisted to have the thing again;

whereupon the apprentice delivered him back the socket
without the stones. And now in trover against the master these points were
ruled:

#118

1.That the finder of a jewel, though he does not by such
finding acquire an absolute property or ownership, yet he has such a

property as will enable him to keep it against all but the
rightful owner, and consequently may maintain trover.

2.That the action will lay against the master, who gives a
credit to his apprentice, and is answerable for his neglect.

3.As to the value of the jewel several of the trade were
examined to prove what a jewel of the finest water that would fit the

socket would be worth; and the Chief Justice directed the
jury, that unless the defendant did produce the jewel, and show it not to be of

the finest water, they should presume the strongest against
him, and make the value of the best jewels the measure of the damages;

which they accordingly did.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Although he sold jewelry, Paul de Lamerie was best known
as the greatest silversmith of 18 th century England. He also had a history of

engaging in ethically dubious business practices and at the
height of his success allowed his father to be buried in a pauper’s grave. The
court’s solution

of ascribing maximum value to the jewel unless the wrongdoer
could produce it is often taken as the fountainhead of the adverse inference
courts draw

against those who have destroyed evidence.

2 .As we shall see, courts are fond of reciting the rule of
law announced in the first numbered paragraph of the opinion in _Armory v.
Delamirie_. But

notice that this rule of law is much broader than was needed
to decide the case. The case was a dispute between someone assumed to be the
“finder” of a

jewel and the shop owner whose apprentice wrongfully
converted the jewel when it was handed to the apprentice for purposes of
valuation. So we have

sequential possession of an object by a finder and a
converter. All the court needed to rule for Armory was “that the finder of a
jewel, though he does not

by such finding acquire an absolute property or ownership,
yet he has such a property as will enable him to keep it against a subsequent
converter or

thief.” This narrower rule of law is easy to justify, isn’t
it? On what possible theory could one defend a rule that allowed thieves to
obtain good title to

objects they steal from finders? On the other hand, as we
shall see, the broad proposition enunciated by the court in support of its
ruling, that the finder

obtains “such a property as will enable him to keep it
against all but the rightful owner,” quickly descends into controversy when
applied in other factual

circumstances.

3 .Suppose Armory stole the jewel from a dresser in a house
in which he was cleaning a chimney. Later, the jewel falls through a hole in a
pocket

in Armory’s trousers. Delamirie spots it on the sidewalk
and, recognizing its value, claims it as a found object. In a suit by Armory
against Delamirie to

recover the value of the jewel, what would be the result
under the rule of law announced in the principal case? Is this consistent with
the outcome we

would want to reach as a matter of policy?

4 .A finder, such as Armory, differs from a pure first
possessor, like Pierson in _Pierson v. Post_ , in two respects. First, when a
finder takes

possession of an object, the finder does not thereby become
the owner. The object is understood to belong to someone else, the true owner,
who cannot

be identified or located. Thus, whatever rights a finder
like Armory has against a third party like Delamirie, the finder’s rights are
subordinate to those of

the true owner (whoever that may be). Second, because the
finder’s rights remain subordinate to the true owner’s, the finder has certain
duties toward

the true owner. Courts have frequently said in this context
that a finder acts as a bailee for the true owner (see Chapter IV for more on
bailments). In

theory at least, this means the finder may be under a legal
duty not to convert the object to the finder’s own use, or not to deliver the
object to anyone

other than the true owner. In practice, since the true owner
is the only one who could enforce these duties, as time passes and the true
owner fails to

appear, the finder may be able to treat the lost object as
if it were not different from the finder’s own property. But until the statute
of limitations for

recovery of personal property runs, and the finder can claim
title by adverse possession, the finder’s title is a qualified one.

5 .Some commentators have advocated a system of rewards for
finders. See, e.g., R.H. Helmholz, Equitable Division and the Law of Finders,
52

Fordham L. Rev. 313 ( 1983 ); Gideon Parchomovsky, Peter
Siegelman & Steve Thel, Of Equal Wrongs and Half Rights, 82 N.Y.U. L. Rev.
738 , 770 – 74 ,

782 – 84 ( 2007 ). Japan has such a system in its Law
Concerning Lost Articles (Ishitsubutsuhō [Law Concerning Lost Articles], Law
no. 40 ( 1899 )). Mark

West argues that Japan’s reputation for getting lost
property back to owners stems in large part from its elaborate legal regime of
finders’ duties to turn

in lost property to the police (or to owners of the
establishment at which it is found), and of owners’ duties to pay rewards of
between 5 and 20 % of the

value of the lost property; possession is awarded to the
finder after six months. Much effort is put into teaching this system to
schoolchildren. Mark D.

West, Losers: Recovering Lost Property in Japan and the
United States, 37 Law & Soc’y Rev. 369 ( 2003 ). West also reports on an
empirical study in

which cell phones and wallets were deliberately left at
locations in a mixed business-shopping district of Tokyo, in midtown Manhattan,
and in front of a

New York grocery store catering to a Japanese expatriate
clientele (with return rates highest in Tokyo and lowest in New York, and the
New York

Japanese location in between). Although less well-known, New
York law provides that objects worth more than $ 20 must be turned into the
police, and

finders can claim the object after a period ranging from 3
months and 10 days to three years and 10 days, depending on the object’s value.

#### Clark v. Maloney

```



Superior Court of Delaware, 1840.



3 Del. 68.



```

Action of trover to recover the value of ten white pine
logs. The logs in question were found by plaintiff floating in the Delaware bay
after a

#120

great freshet, were taken up and moored with ropes in the
mouth of Mispillion creek. They were afterwards in the possession of
defendants, who

refused to give them up, alleging that they had found them
adrift and floating up the creek.

■
BAYARD, CHIEF JUSTICE, charged the jury.—

The plaintiff must show first , that the logs were his
property; and secondly , that they were converted by the defendants to their
own use. In

support of his right of property, the plaintiff relies upon
the fact of his possession of the logs. They were taken up by him, adrift in
the Delaware

bay, and secured by a stake at the mouth of Mispillion
creek. Possession is certainly prima facie evidence of property. It is called
prima facie

evidence because it may be rebutted by evidence of better
title, but in the absence of better title it is as effective a support of title
as the most

conclusive evidence could be. It is for this reason, that
the finder of a chattel, though he does not acquire an absolute property in it,
yet has such

a property, as will enable him to keep it against all but
the rightful owner. The defence consists, not in showing that the defendants
are the

rightful owners, or claim under the rightful owner; but that
the logs were found by them adrift in Mispillion creek, having been loosened
from

their fastening either by accident or design, and they
insist that their title is as good as that of the plaintiff. But it is a well
settled rule of law that

the loss of a chattel does not change the right of property;
and for the same reason that the original loss of these logs by the rightful
owner, did

not change his absolute property in them, but he might have
maintained trover against the plaintiff upon refusal to deliver them, so the

subsequent loss did not divest the special property of the
plaintiff. It follows, therefore, that as the plaintiff has shown a special
property in these

logs, which he never abandoned, and which enabled him to
keep them against all the world but the rightful owner, he is entitled to a
verdict.

Verdict for the plaintiff.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Although the facts are a bit cryptic, it appears that
_Clark v. Maloney_ involves sequential possession by two finders, Finder 1
(Clark) and Finder

2 (Maloney). The court paraphrases the broad rule of law
laid down in _Armory v. Delamirie_ , and rules for Finder 1. But couldn’t the
court cite the very

same proposition in support of a ruling for Finder 2? If
_Armory_ would equally support a ruling for either plaintiff or defendant,
obviously we need some

other principle of law to decide the case. What is that
principle?

2 .Do you think the court in _Clark_ may have harbored
suspicions about the defendants’ claim that that they had found the logs
“adrift and floating

up the creek?” In general, if the rule in cases of Finder 1
versus Finder 2 were that the property goes to Finder 2 , would this indirectly
encourage theft?

The current possessor (who might be a thief) would always

```



121



```

claim that he was a finder, and the burden would be on the
first finder to disprove this claim. This might be difficult to do.

3 .Suppose we want to design the rules in these sequential
possession cases so as to maximize the chances that the true owner will be able
to

recover the property. Which party is more likely to be
located by the true owner—Finder 1 or Finder 2?

#### Anderson v. Gouldberg

```



Supreme Court of Minnesota, 1892.



53 N.W. 636.



```

This action was brought by the plaintiff, Sigfrid Anderson,
against defendants, partners as Gouldberg & Anderson, to recover the
possession

of ninety-three pine logs, marked L S X, or the value
thereof. Plaintiff claimed to have cut the logs on section 22, township 27,
range 15, Isanti

County, in the winter of 1889–1890, and to have hauled them
to a mill on section 6, from which place defendants took them. The title to
section

22 was in strangers, and plaintiff showed no authority from
the owners to cut the logs thereon. Defendants claimed that the logs were cut
on

section 26, in the adjoining township, on land belonging to
the Ann River Logging Company, and that they [the defendants] took the logs by

direction of the Logging Company, who were the owners. The
court charged that even if the plaintiff got possession of the logs as a
trespasser,

his title would be good as against any one except the real
owner or some one who had authority from the owner to take them, and left the
case to

the jury on the question as to whether the logs were cut on
the land of the Logging Company, and taken by defendants under its authority.
The

jury found a verdict for the plaintiff and assessed his
damages at $153.45. From an order denying their motion for a new trial,
defendants

appeal[.] * * *

■
MITCHELL, J. It is settled by the verdict of the jury that the logs in
controversy were not cut upon the land of the defendants, and consequently

that they were entire strangers to the property. For the
purposes of this appeal, we must also assume the fact to be (as there was
evidence from

which the jury might have so found) that the plaintiffs
obtained possession of the logs in the first instance by trespassing upon the
land of some

third party. Therefore the only question is whether bare
possession of property, though wrongfully obtained, is sufficient title to
enable the party

enjoying it to maintain replevin against a mere stranger,
who takes it from him. We had supposed that this was settled in the affirmative
as long

ago, at least, as the early case of Armory v. Delamirie,
(1722) 1 Strange 504 (K.B.), so often cited on that point. When it is said that
to maintain

replevin the plaintiff’s possession must have been lawful,
it means merely that it must have been lawful as against the person who
deprived him

of it; and possession is good title against all the world
except those having a better title. Counsel says that possession only raises a
presumption

of title, which, however, may be rebutted.

#122

Rightly understood, this is correct; but counsel misapplies
it. One who takes property from the possession of another can only rebut this

presumption by showing a superior title in himself, or in
some way connecting himself with one who has. One who has acquired the
possession

of property, whether by finding, bailment, or by mere tort,
has a right to retain that possession as against a mere wrongdoer who is a
stranger to

the property. Any other rule would lead to an endless series
of unlawful seizures and reprisals in every case where property had once passed
out

of the possession of the rightful owner.

Order affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Given the jury’s rejection of the defendants’ story that
they were acting on the authority of the true owners, _Anderson v. Gouldberg_
becomes a

case of Converter 1 (Anderson) versus Converter 2 (Gouldberg
and partner). The court regards the rule of law in _Armory v. Delamirie_ as
resolving such

a dispute. Do you agree? Doesn’t the court substitute an
even broader proposition of law for the one announced in _Armory_? Is this
broader proposition

justifiable as a matter of policy in all circumstances
involving persons who acquire possession wrongfully? For example, does this
broader proposition

mean it would be improper for a Good Samaritan to chase down
a purse snatcher who has stolen a purse from a third party?

2 .Even if we reject the idea that Converter 1 should
prevail against subsequent possessors who do not act wrongfully (say a Good
Samaritan who

recovers the property or a finder), the question remains:
Who should prevail in the case of Converter 1 versus Converter 2? Are you
persuaded by the

court’s statement that Converter 1 should prevail because
“[a]ny other rule would lead to an endless series of unlawful seizures and
reprisals in every

case where property had once passed out of the possession of
the rightful owner?” Could it not be argued that a rule of “no property among
thieves”

would reduce the economic returns to thievery, and thus
reduce the incidence of theft?

3 .As might be expected, there are relatively few reported
decisions involving lawsuits between a Converter 1 and a Converter 2. But there
is at

least one other reported decision, _Russell v. Hill_ , 34
S.E. 640 (N.C. 1899 ), that reaches the opposite result to the one in _Anderson
v. Gouldberg_. This was

yet another dispute about logs that had been wrongfully
taken by A, and then were taken wrongfully from A by B. The court permitted B
to defeat an

action in trover by A by showing that the true owner of the
logs was C. In support of this outcome, the court stated in part:

```



[I]n some of the English books, and in some of the Reports
of our sister states, cases might be found to the contrary, but * * * those
cases



were all founded upon a misapprehension of the principle
laid down in the case of Armory v. Delamirie, 1 Strange, 505. There a chimney



sweep found a lost jewel. He took it into his possession, as
he had a right to do, and was the owner, because of having it in possession,
unless



the true owner should become known. That



```

```



123



```

```



owner was not known, and it was properly decided that trover
would lie in favor of the finder against the defendant, to whom he had handed



it for inspection. But the court said the case would have
been very different if the owner had been known[.] * * *



```

Id. at 640 – 41. Is this an accurate reading of _Armory v.
Delamirie_?

4 .Suppose we want to design the rules in these sequential
possession cases to maximize the chances that the true owner will be able to
recover the

property. Which party is more likely to be found by the true
owner—Converter 1 or Converter 2? Is it easier or harder to answer this
question than it is

when the choice is between Finder 1 and Finder 2?

Relativity of Title and Rejection of the Jus Tertii Defense

Armory v. Delamirie and cases like Clark v. Maloney and
Anderson v. Gouldberg are often cited for the proposition that an action to
protect

possession of property cannot be defeated by setting up a
superior title in a third party (the jus tertii ). The leading case for this
view is often said

to be Jeffries v. The Great Western Railway , (1856) 119
Eng. Rep. 680 (Q.B.). This was an action in trover to recover damages for
wrongful

taking of some railroad cars; the defendant sought to defeat
the action by proving that title to the cars had been assigned to someone else.
In

rejecting the defense, Chief Justice Campbell said:

I am of the opinion that the law is that a person possessed
of goods as his property has a good title as against every stranger, and that

one who takes them from him, having no title in himself, is
a wrongdoer, and cannot defend himself by showing that there was title in

some third person; for against a wrongdoer possession is a
title. The law is * * * essential for the interests of society, that peaceable

possession should not be disturbed by wrongdoers. * * * It
is not disputed that the jus tertii cannot be set up as a defense to an action
of

trespass for disturbing the possession. In this respect I
see no difference between trespass and trover; for in truth the presumption of

law is that the person who has possession has the property.
Can that presumption be rebutted by evidence that the property was in a

third person, when offered as a defense by one who admits
that he himself had no title and was a wrongdoer when he converted the

goods? I am of the opinion that this cannot be done[.] * * *

The proposition that a defendant cannot invoke the jus
tertii to defeat an action to protect possession can be defended on either a
substantive

or procedural theory. The excerpt from Jeffries invokes the
substantive theory: One of the objects of the law is to protect peaceful
possession;

hence, someone who wrongfully interferes with peaceful
possession should not be let off the hook by invoking the superior rights of
some third

party. The procedural theory invokes the bilateral nature of
common-law litigation, and the availability of direct testimony by the two
opposing

parties in such litigation. A sues B; A testifies to what A

#124

knows, B testifies to what B knows; the jury decides which
party is the more credible. To allow one of the parties to put in issue the
rights of a

third party not before the court would present potential
difficulties of proof, particularly in a time before title registration acts
when the best

evidence of title would be deeds in the possession of the
true owner.

### E. THE PRINCIPLE OF ACCESSION

Related to but distinct from possession is what commonly
travels under the heading “accession.” In general, accession tells us what goes

with what: If someone owns A then that person owns some
closely related and in some sense subordinate resource B. In a sense, accession
tells

us what a legal “thing” is: the owner of land owns the
trees, structures, airspace, minerals, etc., associated with the land.
Sometimes these

designations can be altered by transactions, as where
someone owns a house but another owns the land beneath it.

Like possession, accession can also be viewed as an original
acquisition principle. Ownership of some unclaimed or contested resource is

assigned to the owner of some other resource that has a
particularly prominent relationship to the unclaimed or contested resource. In
each case,

the assignment of ownership occurs without regard to any
voluntary conveyance of the unclaimed or contested resource, and without regard
to

whether the existing owner is in possession of the contested
resource. See David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature 327 (David Fate Norton
&

Mary J. Norton eds., 2000) (1739).

### 1. CROPS AND VEGETATION

One familiar manifestation of accession involves trees,
bushes, crops, and flowers that grow on the land. The law generally
distinguishes

between perennial vegetation—forms of plant life that
rejuvenate from year to year without replanting—sometimes called fructus
naturales , and

annual vegetation—forms of plant life that must be replanted
on an annual or other periodic basis—sometimes called fructus industriales. The

general principle is that perennials are deemed to belong to
the owner of the soil on which they grow. Similarly, the owner of the soil also
is

deemed to own fruits, nuts, berries, and flowers that grow
on perennials. In contrast, annuals are deemed to belong to the person in
possession of

the soil on which they grow. Why the difference? Often, of
course, the owner will also be the one in possession of the soil. But
agricultural land

is often leased, in which case the tenant is the one in
possession of the land during the term of the lease, not the owner, who is the
lessor or

landlord. If the tenant plants a crop of wheat, corn, or
soybeans during the term of the lease, the law recognizes that under some
circumstances

the tenant is entitled to harvest and sell the crop, not the
landlord. See generally Ray Andrews Brown, The Law of Personal Property § 17.2
(3d

ed. 1975).

#125

An interesting wrinkle goes by the name of the doctrine of
emblements. Suppose a tenant farmer has what is called a tenancy at will,

meaning the landlord is free to terminate the lease at any
time. While the tenancy lasts, the tenant plants an annual crop of hay or
wheat. Then,

before the crop can be harvested, the landlord terminates
the lease, resumes possession, and claims the crop as his own. In these
circumstances,

the law declares that the tenant, although no longer legally
in possession, has the right to enter the land to cultivate and harvest the
crop. The

doctrine of emblements is an obvious response to a type of
opportunistic behavior by landlords, which as we shall see (Chapter IV) is a
familiar

theme in the law of equity. It does not appear, however,
that the doctrine of emblements required the intervention of a court of
equity—the

common law judges came up with this exception on their own.
The doctrine also shares a commonality with cases involving mistaken improvers

of personal property, as in Wetherbee v. Green , infra,
insofar as tenant, through his or her labor in planting the crop, is regarded
as having a more

prominent relationship to the crop than the absentee
landlord.

NOTE

The understanding that things that sprout from the soil
belong to the one who has the superior claim to the soil is perhaps the most
intuitive and

universal application of the principle of accession. Recall
the statement in _International News_ , supra, that one is generally entitled
to reap what one has

sown. Indeed, this understanding can be seen as the
paradigmatic example of the most general implication of the principle
accession: that improvements

which enhance the value of a thing belong to the person with
the superior claim to the thing being improved. Thus, if the owner of a
suburban home

works assiduously to plant attractive bushes and flowers,
and nurtures their growth and appearance, the owner is understood to be the one
who captures

the enhanced value of the home, whether measured in terms of
self-satisfaction or resale value. Or, to take another example, if someone buys
an old car

rusting away in a barn, and works to restore it to its
original condition, the owner of the old car is understood to be entitled to
the improved version. Of

course, the principle also works in reverse: If one neglects
the upkeep and appearance of a home, or lets their car collect dents and
scratches without

repair, the owner of the thing suffers the diminished value
of the thing. Viewed from this perspective, the principle of accession is one
of the most

powerful aspects of a system of property, creating a
pervasive incentive to invest in and improve things that are owned.

### 2. INCREASE

Another example of the principle of accession, mentioned by
Hume, is that “the offspring of our cattle... [are] esteem’d our property, even

before possession.” This is known as the doctrine of
increase. As summarized in one opinion, “The general rule, in the absence of an
agreement

to the contrary, is that the offspring or increase of tame
or

#126

domestic animals belongs to the owner of the dam or
mother.... In this respect the common law follows the civil law and is founded
on the

maxim, partus sequitur ventrem [the offspring follows the
mother—eds.].... Furthermore, the increase of the increase, ad infinitum, of
domestic

animals comes within the rule and belongs to the owner of
the original stock.” Carruth v. Easterling, 150 So.2d 852, 855 (Miss. 1963)
(quoting 4

Am. Jur. 2d Animals § 10).

In Carruth , a herd of cattle owned by Easterling wandered
onto a farm owned by Carruth. Most were eventually returned, but a dispute

arose between the parties as to whether Easterling had
promised Carruth that he could keep two cows as compensation for the
inconvenience of

the trespass. When Easterling sued for the return of the two
cows, a further dispute arose about whether Easterling was also entitled to a
calf that

had been born to one of the cows while being kept in custody
by Carruth. The Mississippi Supreme Court held that the calf also belonged to

Easterling, even though it had likely been conceived while
on Carruth’s land.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The doctrine of increase is apparently one of those legal
rules recognized in every known legal system that addresses the issue. See
Felix Cohen,

Dialogue on Private Property, 9 Rutgers L. Rev. 357 , 366 (
1954 ). Moreover, it is a rule, not a standard: Courts have not carved out
exceptions for calves

sired by prize-winning bulls, or for calves raised at great
expense by someone other than the owner of the mother. Id. One exception in
English law was

for cygnets or baby swans. The Case of Swans, ( 1592 ) 77
Eng. Rep. 435 (K.B.). Noting that, unusually among animals, swans remain
monogamous

throughout their reproductive years, the court ordered the
cygnets divided equally between the owner of the cock and the owner of the hen.
Id. at 437.

2 .What is the explanation for the doctrine of increase? Is
it because of the evidentiary difficulty in establishing paternity, as
suggested by _The

Case of Swans_? If so, does the advent of modern genetic
testing suggest the doctrine will start to break down? Or is the doctrine
grounded in the

assumption that young animals are generally dependent on
their mothers for nurture and upbringing? On this understanding, assigning
ownership of the

offspring to the owner of the mother helps ensure that this
maternal connection remains unbroken. Are these pragmatic considerations
sufficient to

explain the universal and deeply entrenched nature of the
rule? Does it also rest on a psychological perception of the “closeness” of the
relationship

between the offspring and the mother? Can it be said that in
some sense the mother is “in possession” of the offspring? Is the principle of
accession

another principle of ownership grounded in intuitions about
possession? See 2 Blackstone, Commentaries * 404 (“The doctrine of property
arising from

_accession_ is also grounded on the right of occupancy.”).

```



3 .If technology evolves to the point that cloning of
animals is widespread, will the doctrine of increase cease to determine the
rights to



```

```



127



```

offspring? If the cloning requires a fertilized egg to be
carried to birth by a female animal, arguably many of the rationales for
increase will continue to

apply. But what if an artificial womb or other technology is
devised that allows animals to be generated without any obvious mother?

NOTE ON EXPLAINING THE PRINCIPLE OF ACCESSION

The principle of accession can be regarded as an alternative
principle of acquisition, distinct from first possession. Like first
possession, accession

assigns property rights in unowned things, but instead of
picking out someone who has expended labor at bringing the thing under her
control (as in first

possession), the principle of accession assigns the unowned
thing to the owner of some prominent other thing. Thus, as we have seen, crops
and

vegetation are assigned to the person with superior rights
to the soil, and the doctrine of increase allocates the offspring of an animal
to the owner of the

animal’s mother. Both first possession and accession
identify a singular “winner” in the potential competition to be the owner of
the unowned thing. One

advantage of accession is that it typically identifies this
winner without her having to do anything, and it does not encourage the
wasteful racing

behavior often associated with first possession, discovery,
or creation. (Except insofar as accession makes ownership of the “prominent”
thing even

more valuable, which sometimes might make contests over
_that_ thing more intense.) Especially when a new and unexpected resource
becomes valuable,

the principle of accession assigns it immediately and
without further ado. Accession also enhances the incentives to improve
property, insofar as new

increments in value (like baby animals born to livestock or
crops that sprout up on the land) are automatically assigned to the existing
owner of the

prominently connected asset. But this strength is also a
weakness in that the accession principle, especially if pushed very far, gives
rise to unearned

windfalls, and makes the rich get richer, as it were. See
Thomas W. Merrill, Accession and Original Ownership, 1 J. Legal Analysis 459 (
2009 ).

Accession is particularly important when new valued
attributes come into focus, such as solar or wind resources. See, e.g., Yael R.
Lifshitz, Rethinking

Original Ownership, 66 U. Toronto L.J. 513 ( 2016 ); Note,
Accession on the Frontiers of Property, 133 Harv. L. Rev. 2381 ( 2020 ).

How is the prominence relationship between an unowned and an
owned thing established? Certainly, one can think of various utilitarian
arguments

supporting various accession doctrines. But it has also been
argued, starting with the philosopher David Hume, that accession is also—and
perhaps more

importantly—a function of human psychology, or what Hume
called “the imagination”:

```



This source of property can never be explain’d but from the
imagination... [F]rom an object, that is related to us, we acquire a relation
to



every other object which is related to it, and so on, till
the thought loses the chain by too long a progress. However the relation may
weaken



by each remove, ‘tis not immediately destroy’d; but
frequently connects two objects by means of an intermediate one, which is
related to



both. And this principle is of such force as to give rise to
the right of accession , and causes us to



```

```



128



```

```



acquire the property not only of such objects as we are
immediately posses’d of, but also of such as are closely connected with them.



```

David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, 327 n. 75 (David
Fate Norton & Mary J. Norton eds., 2000 ) ( 1739 ). He went on to give
examples such as

“dominion” over the Orkneys, the Hebrides, the Isle of Man,
and the Isle of Wight going with dominion over (much larger) Great Britain, not
vice versa,

and more generally, “small objects become accessions to
great ones, and not great to small.” Id. Hume’s theory of property generally
rests on

convention, and the accession principle, like possession,
rests on a preference for conforming to a widespread pattern of behavior—such
as respecting

each other’s possession—that could have been otherwise.

In a modern economic account that takes off from Hume,
Robert Sugden recasts Hume’s account in terms of a division game. His primary
example

is the major North Sea oil and gas reserves discovered in
the 1960 s, which gave rise to the question of how to divide the find, which
was of an as-yet

indeterminate extent, among various nations. The solution
adopted was to assign portions of the seabed for purposes of hydrocarbon
development to the

country whose coastline was nearest, which greatly favored
Norway, and to a lesser extent Britain. West Germany with a more distant North
Sea coast

came out badly. Powerful countries like the United States
and the Soviet Union got nothing, as did poor countries around the world, which
could have

used the extra funds. Sugden sees the closeness relationship
as defining “prominence” in this context, rather than the geology of the sea
bed itself,

country size, population, military might, or even default
international law. In an experimental setting (connecting dots, for example)
one can demonstrate

that closeness is often the relation that is psychologically
most prominent. See Robert Sugden, The Economics of Rights, Co-operation and
Welfare, 91 –

92 , 101 – 03 ( 2 d ed. 2004 ). Significantly, Sugden argues
that not only the simplicity but also the very arbitrariness of the closeness
relationship

recommended it as the basis for the division: Unlike some of
the other criteria and procedures (such as “equal division”), the
accession-style solution

based on closeness of coastline was not open to special
pleading and extended argument or, one might add, manipulation.

What more generally is the source of the conventions of
accession and possession, or even ideas about what counts as possession? Sugden
suggests

that it is not simply a matter of might makes right. But how
do expectations converge on the proximity rule? Some solutions are said to be
“focal” in that

people can guess each other’s answers without communication.
In a famous experiment, people at Yale were asked where they would go and when,
if

told to meet the next day in New York City a friend who had
been given similar instructions but with whom no communication was possible.
Despite the

enormous number of possibilities, a majority picked Grand
Central Station and almost all chose noon, exhibiting a high degree of what
Thomas

Schelling termed “tacit cooperation.” Thomas C. Schelling,
The Strategy of Conflict 54 – 56 ( 1963 ). Focal solutions to situations that
can be modeled as

cooperative games draw on common knowledge, but some have
argued that these solutions can arise from hard-wired aspects of mind as well.
Can this

“focal” behavior based on either source be said to be
rational? For a discussion of

```

```

these issues and their relevance to law, see Richard H.
McAdams, A Focal Point Theory of Expressive Law, 86 Va. L. Rev. 1649 , 1659 –
63 ( 2000 ). What

if possessory behavior were conclusively shown to reflect a
hard-wired territorial psychology? See, e.g., Bart J. Wilson, The Property
Species: Mine,

Yours, and the Human Mind ( 2020 ); Jeffrey Evans Stake, The
Property “Instinct,” 359 Phil. Trans. Royal Soc’y Lond. B 1763 ( 2004 ).
Animals’

territoriality has facilitated property in another way: Dogs
can be trained to defend humans’ property boundaries making them quite cheap to
defend,

whereas enforcing norms of good behavior requires judgment
that is beyond a dog’s capacity. See Robert C. Ellickson, Property in Land, 102
Yale L.J.

1315 , 1329 ( 1993 ). If property in land is grounded in
animal territoriality (people’s or dogs’) does that make it more legitimate,
less legitimate, or

neither?

In this part we primarily explore the principle of accession
as a principle of acquisition, but accession serves another, more pervasive
role in

property. Accession can be seen as defining the scope of
property claims. When someone engages in acts of first possession, we need to
know what is

being claimed. How do we know that a hunter is claiming the
whole fox and not the tail only? When someone claims the surface of land by an
act of

first possession (rare these days) or adverse possession,
how do we know that the subsurface and the air rights are being claimed? Here
the definition of

a thing (like a fox) and the _ad coelum_ principle, see
Section 3 infra, tell us how much and exactly what is being claimed. Even
someone as identified

with first possession as the philosopher John Locke
recognized the need within first possession itself for some principle to tell
us what the scope of the

claim should be. In an echo of the doctrine of accession, he
states that labor should give rise to property in a thing when “labour makes
the far greatest

part of the value of [the thing],” John Locke, The Second
Treatise of Government, in Two Treatises of Government 297 (Peter Laslett ed.,
Cambridge

Univ. Press 1988 ) ( 1690 ). He goes on to discuss in detail
how labor forms the overwhelming fraction of the value in all sorts of property
from

agricultural land, to bread, wine, silk and other familiar
examples from accession theory. Id. at 297 – 98. For a discussion of accession
and the scope of

claims, see Henry E. Smith, Intellectual Property as
Property: Delineating Entitlement in Information, 116 Yale L.J. 1742 , 1770 –
77 ( 2007 ); see also

Christopher M. Newman, Transformation in Property and
Copyright, 56 Vill. L. Rev. 251 , 280 – 88 ( 2011 ).

Ask yourself as you go through the materials in this Part
how people converge on an answer to the questions posed by accession: What goes
with

what, or, what is a thing?

### 3 .THE AD COELUM PRINCIPLE

“ Ad coelum ” is short for the Latin maxim cujus est solum,
ejus est usque ad coelum et ad inferos. This has been translated as “To
whomever

the soil belongs, he owns also to the sky and to the
depths.” Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990). We encountered the doctrine in
connection

with Hinman v. Pacific Air Transport , the airplane
overflight case in Chapter I. The doctrine also applies to resources discovered
beneath the

#130

surface, such as minerals, oil and gas deposits, or, as in
the next case, caves.

#### Edwards v. Sims

```



Court of Appeals of Kentucky, 1929.



232 Ky. 791 , 24 S.W. 2 d 619.



```

■
Opinion by COMMISSIONER STANLEY. This case presents a novel question. *

[About [thirteen] years ago L. P. Edwards discovered a cave
under land belonging to him and his wife, Sally Edwards. The entrance to the

cave is on the Edwards land. Edwards named it the “Great
Onyx Cave,” no doubt because of the rock crystal formations within it which are

known as onyx. This cave is located in the cavernous area of
Kentucky, and is only about three miles distant from the world-famous Mammoth

Cave. Its proximity to Mammoth Cave, which for many years
has had an international reputation as an underground wonder, as well as its

beautiful formations, led Edwards to embark upon a program
of advertising and exploitation for the purpose of bringing visitors to his
cave.

Circulars were printed and distributed, signs were erected
along the roads, persons were employed and stationed along the highways to
solicit the

patronage of passing travelers, and thus the fame of the
Great Onyx Cave spread from year to year, until eventually, and before the
beginning of

the present litigation, it was a well-known and
well-patronized cave. Edwards built a hotel near the mouth of the cave to care
for travelers. He

improved and widened the footpaths and avenues in the cave,
and ultimately secured a stream of tourists who paid entrance fees sufficient
not

only to cover the cost of operation, but also to yield a
substantial revenue in addition thereto. The authorities in charge of the
development of the

Mammoth Cave area as a national park undertook to secure the
Great Onyx Cave through condemnation proceedings, and in that suit the value of

the cave was fixed by a jury at $396,000. In April, 1928, F.
P. Lee, an adjoining landowner, filed this suit against Edwards and the heirs
of Sally

Edwards, claiming that a portion of the cave was under his
land, and praying for damages, for an accounting of the profits which resulted
from

the operation of the cave, and for an injunction prohibiting
Edwards and his associates from further trespassing upon or exhibiting any part
of the

cave under Lee’s land. At the inception of this litigation,
Lee undertook to procure a survey of the cave in order that it might be
determined what

portion of it was on his land. The chancellor ordered that a
survey be made, and Edwards prosecuted an appeal from that order to this court.
The

appeal was dismissed because it was not from a final
judgment. Edwards v. Lee, 19 S.W.2d 992 (Ky. 1929).] It was held that the order
was

interlocutory and consequently one from which no appeal
would lie.

Edwards, Proprietor). Courtesy Kentucky Library, Western Kentucky University.

Following that decision, this original proceeding was filed
in this court by the appellants in that case (who were defendants below)
against

Hon. N. P. Sims, judge of the Edmonson circuit court,
seeking a writ of prohibition to prevent him enforcing the order and punishing
the

petitioners for contempt for any disobedience of it. It is
alleged by the petitioners that the lower court was without jurisdiction or
authority to

make the order, and that their cave property and their right
of possession and privacy will be wrongfully and illegally invaded, and that
they will

be greatly and irreparably injured and damaged without
having an adequate remedy, since the damage will have been suffered before
there can be

an adjudication of their rights on a final appeal. * * *

There is but little authority of particular and special
application to caves and cave rights. In few places, if any, can be found
similar works of

nature of such grandeur and of such unique and marvelous
character as to give to caves a commercial value sufficient to cause litigation
as those

peculiar to Edmonson and other counties in Kentucky. The
reader will find of interest the address on “The Legal Story of Mammoth Cave”
by

Hon. John B. Rodes, of Bowling Green, before the 1929
Session of the Kentucky State Bar Association, published in its proceedings. In
Cox v.

Colossal Cavern Co., 276 S.W. 540 (Ky. 1925), the subject of
cave rights was considered, and this court held there may be a severance of the

estate in the property, that is, that one may own the
surface and another the cave rights, the conditions being quite similar to but
not exactly like

those of mineral lands. But there is no such severance
involved in this case, as

#132

it appears that the defendants are the owners of the land
and have in it an absolute right.

Cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum [et] ad infernos
(to whomsoever the soil belongs, he owns also to the sky and to the depths), is
an

old maxim and rule. It is that the owner of realty, unless
there has been a division of the estate, is entitled to the free and unfettered
control of his

own land above, upon, and beneath the surface. So whatever
is in a direct line between the surface of the land and the center of the earth
belongs

to the owner of the surface. Ordinarily that ownership
cannot be interfered with or infringed by third persons. There are, however,
certain

limitations on the right of enjoyment of possession of all
property, such as its use to the detriment or interference with a neighbor and
burdens

which it must bear in common with property of a like kind.

With this doctrine of ownership in mind, we approach the
question as to whether a court of equity has a transcendent power to invade
that

right through its agents for the purpose of ascertaining the
truth of a matter before it, which fact thus disclosed will determine certainly
whether

or not the owner is trespassing upon his neighbor’s
property. Our attention has not been called to any domestic case, nor have we
found one, in

which the question was determined either directly or by
analogy. It seems to the court, however, that there can be little
differentiation, so far as

the matter now before us is concerned, between caves and
mines. And as declared in 40 C. J. 947:

A court of equity, however, has the inherent power,
independent of statute, to compel a mine owner to permit an inspection of his

works at the suit of a party who can show reasonable ground
for suspicion that his lands are being trespassed upon through them, and

may issue an injunction to permit such inspection.

There is some limitation upon this inherent power, such as
that the person applying for such an inspection must show a bona fide claim and

allege facts showing a necessity for the inspection and
examination of the adverse party’s property; and, of course, the party whose
property is to

be inspected must have had an opportunity to be heard in
relation thereto. In the instant case it appears that these conditions were
met. The

respondent cites several cases from other jurisdictions in
which this power has been recognized and exercised. * * *

We can see no difference in principle between the invasion
of a mine on adjoining property to ascertain whether or not the minerals are

being extracted from under the applicant’s property and an
inspection of this respondent’s property through his cave to ascertain whether
or not

he is trespassing under this applicant’s property.

It appears that before making this order the court had
before him surveys of the surface of both properties and the conflicting
opinions of

witnesses as to whether or not the Great Onyx Cave extended
under the surface of the plaintiff’s land. This opinion evidence was of

comparatively

#133

little value, and as the chancellor (now respondent)
suggested, the controversy can be quickly and accurately settled by surveying
the cave; and

“if defendants are correct in their contention this survey
will establish it beyond all doubt and their title to this cave will be forever
quieted. If the

survey shows the Great Onyx Cave extends under the lands of
plaintiffs, defendants should be glad to know this fact and should be just as
glad to

cease trespassing upon plaintiff’s lands, if they are in
fact doing so.” The peculiar nature of these conditions, it seems to us, makes
it imperative

and necessary in the administration of justice that the
survey should have been ordered and should be made.

It appearing that the circuit court is not exceeding its
jurisdiction or proceeding erroneously, the claim of irreparable injury need
not be

given consideration. It is only when the inferior court is
acting erroneously, and great or irreparable damage will result, and there is
no adequate

remedy by appeal, that a writ of prohibition will issue
restraining the other tribunal, as held by authorities cited above.

The writ of prohibition is therefore denied.

■ LOGAN,
J. (dissenting). The majority opinion allows that to be done which will prove
of incalculable injury to Edwards without benefiting Lee,

who is asking that this injury be done. I must dissent from
the majority opinion, confessing that I may not be able to show, by any legal

precedent, that the opinion is wrong, yet having an abiding
faith in my own judgment that it is wrong.

It deprives Edwards of rights which are valuable, and
perhaps destroys the value of his property, upon the motion of one who may have
no

interest in that which it takes away, and who could not
subject it to his dominion or make any use of it, if he should establish that
which he seeks

to establish in the new suit wherein the survey is sought.

It sounds well in the majority opinion to tritely say that
he who owns the surface of real estate, without reservation, owns from the
center of

the earth to the outmost sentinel of the solar system. The
age-old statement, adhered to in the majority opinion as the law, in truth and
fact, is not

true now and never has been. I can subscribe to no doctrine
which makes the owner of the surface also the owner of the atmosphere filling

illimitable space. Neither can I subscribe to the doctrine
that he who owns the surface is also the owner of the vacant spaces in the
bowels of the

earth.

The rule should be that he who owns the surface is the owner
of everything that may be taken from the earth and used for his profit or

happiness. Anything which he may take is thereby subjected
to his dominion, and it may be well said that it belongs to him. I concede the

soundness of that rule, which is supported by the cases
cited in the majority opinion; but they have no application to the question
before the court

in this case. They relate mainly to mining rights; that is,
to substances under the surface which the owner may subject to his

#134

dominion. But no man can bring up from the depths of the
earth the Stygian darkness and make it serve his purposes; neither can he
subject to his

dominion the bottom of the ways in the caves on which
visitors tread, and for these reasons the owner of the surface has no right in
such a cave

which the law should, or can, protect because he has nothing
of value therein, unless, perchance, he owns an entrance into it and has
subjected

the subterranean passages to his dominion.

A cave or cavern should belong absolutely to him who owns
its entrance, and this ownership should extend even to its utmost reaches if he

has explored and connected these reaches with the entrance.
When the surface owner has discovered a cave and prepared it for purposes of

exhibition, no one ought to be allowed to disturb him in his
dominion over that which he has conquered and subjected to his uses.

It is well enough to hang to our theories and ideas, but
when there is an effort to apply old principles to present-day conditions, and
they

will not fit, then it becomes necessary for a readjustment,
and principles and facts as they exist in this age must be made conformable.
For these

reasons the old sophistry that the owner of the surface of
land is the owner of everything from zenith to nadir must be reformed, and the
reason

why a reformation is necessary is because the theory was
never true in the past, but no occasion arose that required the testing of it.
Man had no

dominion over the air until recently, and, prior to his
conquering the air, no one had any occasion to question the claim of the
surface owner that

the air above him was subject to his dominion. Naturally the
air above him should be subject to his dominion in so far as the use of the
space is

necessary for his proper enjoyment of the surface, but
further than that he has no right in it separate from that of the public at
large. The true

principle should be announced to the effect that a man who
owns the surface, without reservation, owns not only the land itself, but
everything

upon, above, or under it which he may use for his profit or
pleasure, and which he may subject to his dominion and control. But further
than this

his ownership cannot extend. It should not be held that he
owns that which he cannot use and which is of no benefit to him, and which may
be of

benefit to others.

Shall a man be allowed to stop airplanes flying above his
land because he owns the surface? He cannot subject the atmosphere through

which they fly to his profit or pleasure; therefore, so long
as airplanes do not injure him, or interfere with the use of his property, he
should be

helpless to prevent their flying above his dominion. Should
the waves that transmit intelligible sound through the atmosphere be allowed to
pass

over the lands of surface-owners? If they take nothing from
him and in no way interfere with his profit or pleasure, he should be powerless
to

prevent their passage?

If it be a trespass to enter on the premises of the
landowner, ownership meaning what the majority opinion holds that it means, the
aviator

who flies over the land of one who owns the surface, without
his

#135

consent, is guilty of a trespass as defined by the common
law and is subject to fine or imprisonment, or both, in the discretion of a
jury.

If he who owns the surface does not own and control the
atmosphere above him, he does not own and control vacuity beneath the surface.

He owns everything beneath the surface that he can subject
to his profit or pleasure, but he owns nothing more. Therefore, let it be
written that a

man who owns land does, in truth and in fact, own everything
from zenith to nadir, but only for the use that he can make of it for his
profit or

pleasure. He owns nothing which he cannot subject to his
dominion.

In the light of these unannounced principles which ought to
be the law in this modern age, let us give thought to the petitioner Edwards,
his

rights and his predicament, if that is done to him which the
circuit judge has directed to be done. Edwards owns this cave through right of

discovery, exploration, development, advertising,
exhibition, and conquest. Men fought their way through the eternal darkness,
into the

mysterious and abysmal depths of the bowels of a groaning
world to discover the theretofore unseen splendors of unknown natural scenic

wonders. They were conquerors of fear, although now and then
one of them, as did Floyd Collins, paid with his life, for his hardihood in

adventuring into the regions where Charon with his boat had
never before seen any but the spirits of the departed. They let themselves down
by

flimsy ropes into pits that seemed bottomless; they clung to
scanty handholds as they skirted the brinks of precipices while the flickering
flare of

their flaming flambeaux disclosed no bottom to the yawning
gulf beneath them; they waded through rushing torrents, not knowing what
awaited

them on the farther side; they climbed slippery steeps to
find other levels; they wounded their bodies on stalagmites and stalactites and
other

curious and weird formations; they found chambers,
star-studded and filled with scintillating light reflected by a phantasmagoria
revealing

fancied phantoms, and tapestry woven by the toiling gods in
the dominion of Erebus; hunger and thirst, danger and deprivation could not
stop

them. Through days, weeks, months, and years—ever linking
chamber with chamber, disclosing an underground land of enchantment, they

continued their explorations; through the years they toiled
connecting these wonders with the outside world through the entrance on the
land of

Edwards which he had discovered; through the years they
toiled finding safe ways for those who might come to view what they had found
and

placed their seal upon. They knew nothing, and cared less,
of who owned the surface above; they were in another world where no law forbade

their footsteps. They created an underground kingdom where
Gulliver’s people may have lived or where Ayesha may have found the revolving

column of fire in which to bathe meant eternal youth.

When the wonders were unfolded and the ways were made safe,
then Edwards patiently, and again through the years, commenced the

advertisement of his cave. First came one to see, then
another, then two together, then small groups, then small crowds, then large
crowds, and

#136

then the multitudes. Edwards had seen his faith justified.
The cave was his because he had made it what it was, and without what he had
done it

was nothing of value. The value is not in the black vacuum
that the uninitiated call a cave. That which Edwards owns is something
intangible and

indefinable. It is his vision translated into a reality.

Then came the horse leach’s daughters crying: “Give me,”
“give me.” Then came the “surface men” crying, “I think this cave may run

under my lands.” They do not know they only “guess,” but
they seek to discover the secrets of Edwards so that they may harass him and
take

from him that which he has made his own. They have come to a
court of equity and have asked that Edwards be forced to open his doors and his

ways to them so that they may go in and despoil him; that
they may lay his secrets bare so that others may follow their example and dig
into the

wonders which Edwards has made his own. What may be the
result if they stop his ways? They destroy the cave, because those who visit it
are

they who give it value, and none will visit it when the ways
are barred so that it may not be exhibited as a whole.

It may be that the law is as stated in the majority opinion
of the court, but equity, according to my judgment, should not destroy that
which

belongs to one man when he at whose behest the destruction
is visited, although with some legal right, is not benefited thereby. Any
ruling by a

court which brings great and irreparable injury to a party
is erroneous.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The Great Onyx cave is said to have been discovered
originally by one Edmund Turner, who approached Edwards in 1915 , telling him
that he

knew of a cave underneath his land. The two developed the
cave together, with Turner concentrating on the exploration and Edwards on
promoting the

tourism business. Turner did his part without profiting from
the cave, and Edwards later claimed the discovery as his alone. One legend has
it that in

revenge Turner blocked up passages that led to the nearby
Mammoth Cave, and to this day the Great Onyx Cave is the only major cave not
connected up

to the main local cave system in the Flint Ridge area,
despite persistent effort. See Roger W. Brucker & Richard A. Watson, The
Longest Cave 277

( 1976 ). Should Turner have had a legal claim against
Edwards? Is self-help (if that is what it was) the only answer here? If Turner
had come to you as a

lawyer before he revealed his discovery to Edwards, how
would you have advised him?

2 .Does the dissent in the principal case disagree with the
_ad coelum_ principle, or does it argue for a different interpretation of the
rule than the one

advocated by the majority? Under the dissent’s proposed
rule, what additional facts might have to be found before determining that Lee
has no rights to

the cave, assuming it occupies a portion of his column of
space underground? Is the dissent grounded in the equitable notion that one
should not invoke

rights with no prospect of direct benefit (or not to “stand
on one’s extreme rights”), or is it arguing for an alternative rule that
ownership of the cave goes

with the ownership of the mouth? For a proposal

```



137



```

along the latter lines and a survey of some of the
alternatives, see Richard A. Epstein, Holdouts, Externalities, and the Single
Owner: One More Salute

to Ronald Coase, 36 J.L. & Econ. 553 , 563 – 67 ( 1993
).

3 .Can you see how the _ad coelum_ principle represents
another example of the general principle of accession? We start with ownership
of the

surface. Then, as new increments of value are discovered
below the surface (minerals, caves, oil and gas) or above the surface
(engineering capabilities

to construct very tall buildings), these increments of value
are automatically assigned to the owner of the surface—the most prominent
pre-assigned

property. Does the _ad coelum_ principle also represent a
generalization about who is assumed to be “in possession” of minerals or caves
discovered

beneath the surface? Is the problem in the present case that
this generalization is difficult to justify on the particular facts presented?

4 .It turned out that roughly one third of the Great Onyx
Cave was under Lee’s land. In a later opinion the Kentucky high court affirmed
the

chancellor’s award of one third of the net profits from the
cave business to Lee. Division was mainly in proportion to surface area with
some

consideration of the proportion of noteworthy sights in the
two parts of the cave. Noting that the Edwardses were conscious wrongdoers, it
agreed that

restitution for unjust enrichment was appropriate, and
required disgorgement one third of the profits. On the one hand this remedy
disregards the fact

that there would have been no profits at all from that one
third of the cave without the Edwardses’ efforts, but it also takes account of
the fact that the

Edwardses were “wrongdoers” knowingly exploiting Lee’s
portion of the cave. But the court also did not go so far as to award Lee any
share of the

profits from the related hotel business. Edwards v. Lee’s
Administrator, 96 S.W. 2 d 1028 , 1029 (Ky. 1936 ). (An innocent trespasser
might be liable only

for the rental value of the land, but what is the rental
value of a mouthless portion of a noteworthy cave?) In an intriguing
concurrence, Justice Thomas

wanted to treat the cave as being co-owned by the surface
owners in proportion to their ownership of the surface. What’s the difference?
For one thing,

he was worried about parts of the cave being closed off to
the public, in what might be termed an anticommons. For more on the rights and
duties of co-

owners among themselves, see Chapter V. Why don’t we see
more solutions based on notions of co-ownership in the area of accession? Is
some version

of co-ownership of airspace in effect the result in the
airplane overflight cases—which Justice Thomas saw as supportive of his
approach?

5 .Judge Logan’s dissent views Lee’s behavior as an
inequitable exercise of his technical rights. Sounding a similar note, one
leading torts treatise

states that because the surface owner had no practical
access to the caves, either now or in the future, the majority decision was
“dog-in-the-manger law,

and can only be characterized as... [a] very bad one.” W.
Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts § 13 ( 5 th ed. 1984
). The reference

is to one of Aesop’s Fables, in which a dog prevents oxen
from eating hay, which the dog cannot eat himself. Should such an assertion of
rights be

considered an abuse of right or extortion (see Chapter IV)?

6 .During and after the litigation, the effort to create a
national park around the Mammoth Cave system consumed the area, and it was one
in which

none other than dissenting Judge Marvel Mills Logan (later a
Senator)

```



138



```

was deeply involved all along. Bruce Ziff, The Great Onyx
Cases—A Micro-History, 40 N. Ky. L. Rev. 1 ( 2013 ). After the litigation over
the Great

Onyx Cave, its owners operated it as an inholding within the
Mammoth Cave National Park, established in 1941 , much to the annoyance of Park
Service

officials. One reason for their irritation was that “[s]ome
private owners—and not just those with inholdings inside the Park—set up
official-looking

booths along the road outside the Park. Here they stationed
‘cappers’—solicitors in khaki uniforms and Smokey Bear hats to direct tourists
not to

Mammoth Cave, but to other commercial caves in the
vicinity.” Self-help started getting out of control in the so-called “Kentucky
Cave Wars.” In 1961 ,

the Cox estate sold the Great Onyx Cave to the federal
government and it was integrated into the park. See Brucker & Watson,
supra, at 59 – 60 , 297.

### 4 .COMBINATIONS OF PERSONAL PROPERTY

The law of personal property contains several doctrines
designed to deal with situations in which the personal property of A is joined
with

the personal property of B (often called a “mixture”), or
the personal property of A is combined with the fungible personal property of a

collection of other persons (often called “confusion”), or
the personal property of A is mistakenly modified by the labor of another
(sometimes

called “specification”). If the combination can be reversed
at a reasonable cost or if the parties have contributed fungible property (like
grains of

corn) that can be divided up according to the quantity
contributed by each, courts will try to restore the parties to their respective
contributions.

But if the combination cannot be reversed, the proper
analysis is more complicated, as illustrated by the following case.

#### Wetherbee v. Green

```



Supreme Court of Michigan, 1871.



22 Mich. 311.



```

This was an action of replevin, brought by George Green,
Charles H. Camp and George Brooks, in the circuit court for the county of Bay,

against George Wetherbee, for one hundred and fifty-eight
thousand black ash barrel-hoops, alleged to be of the value of eight hundred
dollars.

* * * [T]he jury found for plaintiffs. The judgment entered
      upon the verdict comes into this court by writ of error.

■ COOLEY
J.: * * * Wetherbee claimed * * * that replevin could not be maintained for the
hoops, because he had cut the timber in good faith,

relying upon a permission which he supposed proceeded from
the parties having lawful right to give it, and had, by the expenditure of his
labor

and money, converted the trees into chattels immensely more
valuable than they were as they stood in the forest, and thereby he had made
such

chattels his own. And he offered to show that the standing
timber was worth twenty-five dollars only, while the hoops replevied were shown
by

the evidence to be worth near seven hundred dollars * * *
The evidence

#139

offered to establish these facts was rejected by the court,
and the plaintiffs obtained judgment. * * *

The objections to allowing the owner of the trees to reclaim
the property under such circumstances are, that it visits the involuntary
wrong-

doer too severely for his unintentional trespass, and at the
same time compensates the owner beyond all reason for the injury he has
sustained. In

the redress of private injuries the law aims not so much to
punish the wrongdoer as to compensate the sufferer for his injuries; and the
cases in

which it goes farther and inflicts punitory or vindictive
penalties are those in which the wrong-doer has committed the wrong recklessly,

willfully, or maliciously, and under circumstances
presenting elements of aggravation. Where vicious motive or reckless disregard
of right are

not involved, to inflict upon a person who has taken the
property of another, a penalty equal to twenty or thirty times its value, and
to compensate

the owner in a proportion equally enormous, is so opposed to
all legal idea of justice and right and to the rules which regulate the
recovery of

damages generally, that if permitted by the law at all, it
must stand out as an anomaly and must rest upon peculiar reasons.

As a general rule, one whose property has been appropriated
by another without authority has a right to follow it and recover the
possession

from any one who may have received it; and if, in the mean
time, it has been increased in value by the addition of labor or money, the
owner

may, nevertheless, reclaim it, provided there has been no
destruction of substantial identity. So far the authorities are agreed. A man
cannot

generally be deprived of his property except by his own
voluntary act or by operation of law; and if unauthorized parties have bestowed
expense

or labor upon it, that fact cannot constitute a bar to his
reclaiming it, so long as identification is not impracticable. But there must,
nevertheless,

in reason be some limit to the right to follow and reclaim
materials which have undergone a process of manufacture. Mr. Justice Blackstone
lays

down the rule very broadly, that if a thing is changed into
a different species, as by making wine out of another’s grapes, oil from his
olives, or

bread from his wheat, the product belongs to the new
operator, who is only to make satisfaction to the former proprietor for the
materials

converted: 2 Bl. Com., 404. We do not understand this to be
disputed as a general proposition, though there are some authorities which hold
that,

in the case of a willful appropriation, no extent of
conversion can give to the willful trespasser a title to the property so long
as the original

materials can be traced in the improved article. The
distinction thus made between the case of an appropriation in good faith and
one based on

intentional wrong, appears to have come from the civil law,
which would not suffer a party to acquire a title by accession, founded on his
own

act, unless he had taken the materials in ignorance of the
true owner, and given them a form which precluded their being restored to their
original

condition. 2 Kent, 363. While many cases have followed the
rule as broadly stated by Blackstone, others have

#140

adopted the severe rule of the civil law where the
conversion was in willful disregard of right. The New York cases of Betts v.
Lee, 5 Johns. 348

(N.Y. 1810); Curtis v. Groat , 6 Johns. 168 (N.Y. 1810), and
Chandler v. Edson , 9 Johns. 362 (N.Y. 1812), were all cases where the willful

trespasser was held to have acquired no property by a very
radical conversion * * * But we are not called upon in this case to express any
opinion

regarding the rule applicable in the case of a willful
trespasser, since the authorities agree in holding that, when the wrong had
been involuntary,

the owner of the original materials is precluded, by the
civil law and common law alike, from following and reclaiming the property
after it has

undergone a transformation which converts it into an article
substantially different.

The cases of confusion of goods are closely analogous. It
has always been held that he who, without fraud, intentional wrong, or reckless

disregard of the rights of others, mingled his goods with
those of another person, in such manner that they could not be distinguished,
should,

nevertheless, be protected in his ownership so far as the
circumstances would permit. The question of motive here becomes of the highest

importance; for, as Chancellor Kent says, if the commingling
of property as willfully made without mutual consent, * * * the common law gave

the entire property, without any account, to him whose
property “was originally invaded, and its distinct character destroyed.
Popham’s Rep. 38,

Pl. 2. If A will willfully intermix his corn or hay with
that of B, or casts his gold into another’s crucible, so that it becomes
impossible to

distinguish what belonged to A from what belonged to B, the
whole belongs to B.” But this rule only applies to wrongful or fraudulent

intermixtures. There may be an intentional intermingling,
and yet no wrong intended, as where a man mixes two parcels together, supposing
both

to be his own; or, that he was about to mingle his with his
neighbor’s, by agreement, and mistakes the parcel. In such cases, which may be

deemed accidental intermixtures, it would be unreasonable
and unjust that he should lose his own or be obliged to take and pay for his

neighbor’s[.] * * * In many cases there will be difficulty
in determining precisely how he can be protected with due regard to the rights
of the

other party; but it is clear that the law will not forfeit
his property in consequence of the accident or inadvertence, unless a just
measure of redress

to the other party renders it inevitable.

The important question on this branch of the case appears to
us to be, whether standing trees, when cut and manufactured into hoops, are to

be regarded as so far changed in character that their
identity can be said to be destroyed within the meaning of the authorities. And
as we enter

upon a discussion of this question, it is evident at once
that it is difficult, if not impossible, to discover any invariable and
satisfactory test which

can be applied to all the cases which arise in such infinite
variety. “If grain be taken and made into malt, or money taken and made into a
cup, or

timber taken and made into a house, it is held in the old
English

#141

law that the property is so altered as to change the title.”
2 Kent, 363. But cloth made into garments, leather into shoes, trees hewn or
sawed into

timber, and iron made into bars, it is said may be reclaimed
by the owner in their new and original shape. Some of the cases place the right
of the

former owner to take the thing in its altered condition upon
the question whether its identity could be made out by the senses. But this is

obviously a very unsatisfactory test, and in many cases
would wholly defeat the purpose which the law has in view in recognizing a
change of

title in any of these cases. That purpose is not to
establish any arbitrary distinctions, based upon mere physical reasons, but to
adjust the redress

afforded to the one party and the penalty inflicted upon the
other, as near as circumstances will permit, to the rules of substantial
justice.

It may often happen that no difficulty will be experienced
in determining the identity of a piece of timber which has been taken and built

into a house; but no one disputes that the right of the
original owner is gone in such a case. A particular piece of wood might,
perhaps, be traced

without trouble into a church organ, or other equally
valuable article; but no one would defend a rule of law which, because the
identity could be

determined by the senses, would permit the owner of the wood
to appropriate a musical instrument, a hundred or a thousand times the value of

his original materials, when the party who, under like
circumstances, has doubled the value of another man’s corn by converting it
into malt, is

permitted to retain it, and held liable for the original
value only. Such distinctions in the law would be without reason, and could not
be tolerated.

When the right to the improved article is the point in
issue, the question, how much the property or labor of each has contributed to
make it what

it is, must always be one of first importance. The owner of
a beam built into the house of another loses his property in it, because the
beam is

insignificant in value or importance as compared to that to
which it has become attached, and the musical instrument belongs to the maker
rather

than to the man whose timber was used in making it—not
because the timber cannot be identified, but because, in bringing it to its
present

condition the value of the labor has swallowed up and
rendered insignificant the value of the original materials. The labor, in the
case of the

musical instrument, is just as much the principal thing as
the house is in the other case instanced; the timber appropriated is in each
case

comparatively unimportant.

No test which satisfies the reason of the law can be applied
in the adjustment of questions of title to chattels by accession, unless it
keeps in

view the circumstance of relative values. When we bear in
mind the fact that what the law aims at is the accomplishment of substantial
equity, we

shall readily perceive that the fact of the value of the
materials having been increased a hundred-fold, is of more importance in the
adjustment

than any chemical change or mechanical transformation,
which, however radical, neither is expensive to the party making it, nor adds
materially

to the value. There may be complete changes with so

#142

little improvement in value, that there could be no hardship
in giving the owner of the original materials the improved article; but in the
present

case, where the defendant’s labor—if he shall succeed in
sustaining his offer of testimony—will appear to have given the timber in its
present

condition nearly all its value, all the grounds of equity
exist which influence the courts in recognizing a change of title under any
circumstances.

We are of opinion that the court erred in rejecting the
testimony offered. The defendant, we think, had a right to show that he had

manufactured the hoops in good faith, and in the belief that
he had the proper authority to do so; and if he should succeed in making that

showing, he was entitled to have the jury instructed that
the title to the timber was changed by a substantial change of identity, and
that the

remedy of the plaintiff was an action to recover damages for
the unintentional trespass.

* * * For the reasons given the judgment must be reversed,
      with costs, and a new trial ordered.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The law governing specification (as it is sometimes
called) is another illustration of the principle of accession, at least if we
make the Lockean

assumption that every person owns his or her own labor. On
this assumption, the question in such cases is which “property right” is more
prominent: the

original object (the tree, the grapes, the wheat) or the
labor expended by the improver in transforming the original object (making
hoops, or wine, or

bread). If the labor is “insignificant” and the original
object “prominent,” then title stays with the original owner of the object. If
the labor is

“prominent” and the original object “insignificant,” then
title passes to the improver (and the improver pays the original owner damages
equal to the

value of the original object).

2 .Justice Cooley emphasizes the importance of the good
faith/bad faith distinction, and indicates his agreement with cases that refuse
to transfer

title to the creator/improver who has acted in bad faith,
i.e., with knowledge that someone else has superior title to the original
object. Do you think that

bad faith should be irrelevant (Blackstone’s view,
apparently), should automatically disqualify someone from obtaining title by
accession (Cooley’s

view), or should be one factor to weigh against other
factors, like the degree of transformation and the disparity in value added?

3 .Justice Cooley also seeks to downplay the significance of
the degree of transformation of the object, and instead puts greater weight on
the

disparity in value. He had to do this in order to find title
by accession in _Wetherbee_ , since although the identity of the original logs
could be traced in the

hoops, the disparity in value was enormous: $ 700 for the
hoops versus $ 25 for the trees, or a ratio of 28 to 1. Interestingly, just six
years later, in _Isle

Royale Mining Co. v. Hertin_ , 37 Mich. 332 ( 1877 ),
Cooley, by then Chief Justice, also wrote for the court in denying a claim
seeking restitution for the

```



143



```

value of labor expended in mistakenly cutting trees on land
owned by someone else. The value of the cut timber was $ 2. 87 ½ per cord, of
which $ 1. 87 ½

was attributable to labor of the improver, for a ratio of 1.
875 to 1. Perhaps more importantly, the mistaken improver had not really
transformed the trees

at all, other than to cut them down. The opinion in _Isle
Royale_ placed considerably more emphasis on the absence of transformation,
noting that

“[p]erhaps no case has gone further than _Wetherbee v.
Green_... [where] the identity of trees and hoops was perfectly capable of
being traced and

established.”

4 .Why do you suppose the degree of transformation has been
an important factor in the law of combinations—perhaps more important than good

faith or relative value—from Roman times down to the
present? Does extensive transformation suggest that the laborer has taken
“possession” of the

object?

5 .Note that the law of combinations also implicates the
principle of restitution, discussed more fully in Chapter IV. If the improver
is deemed to be

the more prominent contributor of value to the transformed
object, the improver gets title to the object, but must pay damages to the
owner of the raw

materials that have been transformed. The measure of damages
is presumably the fair market value of the raw material in its
pre-transformation state.

Suppose the contrary conclusion is reached—that the owner of
the raw materials is the more prominent contributor of final value, and hence
gets title to

the object. Must the owner of the raw material make
restitution to the improver for the increased value to the object caused by the
improvements? What

if, say, the original owner of the timber did not want the
trees cut down, but rather prefers that they remain standing as a forest?
(Recall Pardee v.

Camden Lumber Co., excerpted in Chapter I.) See Restatement
Third, Restitution and Unjust Enrichment §§ 9 – 10 ( 2011 ) (restitution law
avoids foisting

transactions on unwilling parties but will look to whether
that party expressed a willingness to pay, has been spared an otherwise
necessary expense, or

realizes the conferred benefit in money terms).

6 .Most of the cases involving the law of combinations have
a quaint quality: hoops being carved from logs, wine being pressed from grapes,
and

so forth. But issues involving improvements arise with
considerable frequency in modern intellectual property law. Suppose A gets a
patent on a new

invention, and B then makes an improvement on the invention.
Or suppose A writes a novel which is copyrighted, and B then turns it into a
screenplay

for a movie. What are the respective rights of A and B in
these situations? Intellectual property law does not use combinations doctrine
in resolving

these issues. Instead, Mark Lemley, a leading intellectual
property scholar, summarizes patent law this way:

```



The basic structure of the patent model is * * * quite
simple. The treatment of improvements is a function of the value and
significance of the



improvement in relation to the original invention.
Improvements which are minor in relation to the original invention are likely
to be found to



infringe[.] * * * More significant improvements within the
range of the original claims



```

```



144



```

```



still infringe the original patent, but in such cases the
improver is entitled to a patent of his own. This not only encourages the
development of



significant improvements, but gives improvers bargaining
leverage in licensing negotiations in direct proportion to the relative value
of their



improvements. Finally, truly radical improvements are
exempted from liability to the original patent owner, regardless of whether
they fall



within the literal scope of the original claims, in order to
encourage such improvements and to ensure that they reach the market.

```

■
ROBINSON, JUSTICE. On August 7, 1943, Jacob Green agreed to sell to William
Strain his waterfront home on Mercer Island for thirty-five

thousand dollars[.] * * * On August 20, 1943, Green and wife
executed a statutory warranty deed to Strain and wife, which they duly

acknowledged and delivered to the purchasers on August 27th,
receiving the purchase price in full. At some time thereafter, they left the

premises, taking with them, from the basement, the hot water
tank and enclosed electric heater, the Venetian blinds from the windows,
certain

lighting fixtures, and three mirrors, two of which were
rather firmly attached to the walls. It was also claimed, in the ensuing
lawsuit, that they

unlawfully carried away a fireplace screen, a tool house,
and certain chicken wire, with the posts which supported it. The total value of
the

articles removed was alleged to be $1,105.

On November 8, 1943, Mr. Hamley, as attorney for the
Strains, demanded, in writing, that all of said property be returned to the
premises.

No part of the demand being complied with, this action was
brought in March, 1944. The plaintiffs prayed for a judgment requiring the

defendants to return the property, or, in case that that
could not be done, for $1,105, and additional sums alleged to have been
necessarily

expended by the plaintiffs on account of the removal from
the property, or which they would be required to expend to reinstall it.

#145

It appears from the evidence that, when the defendants
purchased the home, they found the hot water system inadequate, and put in a
large,

modern insulated tank, with an automatic electric control.
When they left the house, they disconnected that tank from the plumbing and
electric

system, and reconnected the much smaller tank which was
serving the house when they bought it. This the plaintiffs found wholly
inadequate,

and supplemented it, as far as, in view of war time
scarcities, they were able to do so, by buying and hooking up two large tanks,
and making

certain other additions.

When the plaintiffs agreed to buy the house, and up until
they had completed the payment on the purchase price, there was a large and

beautiful crystal chandelier in the center of the dining
room ceiling, and five other matching fixtures in that room and adjoining
rooms. The

distinctive feature of these articles was their
ornamentation by a great number of pendants of imported crystal glass. These
fixtures the Greens

also disconnected and took with them. Before departing,
however, they bought, and installed in place of the fixtures removed, some
highly

inferior plastic imitations.

When the plaintiffs purchased the house, there was a large
plate glass mirror on one of the dining room walls. It had been installed in
the

following manner: A large piece of three-eighths-inch
plywood was firmly nailed to the plastered wall, and the mirror was attached to
this

backing by screws. The mirror itself was, of course, readily
removed. The Greens removed it, and left the plastered wall with the large
square of

plywood in the middle of it. The mirror having been removed,
the plywood had no visible excuse for being there, and the Strains removed it.
It

still had twenty-six nails in it when introduced in
evidence, and holes where there had been a dozen or so more. When the plywood
was pried

from the wall, each nail brought some of the plaster with
it. The mirror over the living room fireplace was attached to the wall in the
same

manner, although fewer nails were used. This mirror the
Greens also removed. The mirror in what was known as the powder room also had a

plywood backing, but there is no very convincing testimony
that the plywood was nailed, or attached, to the wall, and Mrs. Green’s
testimony

was to the effect that the mirror merely rested upon a table
and was held in place by a wire which ran to a hook above it, just as pictures
are hung.

As for the other articles, the Venetian blinds were of odd
sizes, cut and built especially for the windows of the house. The so-called
tool

house turned out to be a child’s playhouse, and there was no
evidence that chicken wire was ever taken from the premises.

The trial court held that the automatic hot water tank was a
fixture, and must be returned. The Venetian blinds were also held to be
fixtures,

and ordered returned. Certain damages were awarded with
respect to reinstallations. As the defendants have not cross-appealed, we are
not

concerned with that portion of the judgment. The court,
however, held that the light fixtures and mirrors were personal property, which
the

#146

defendants had a right to remove, and it is from that
holding that this appeal is taken.

We will not undertake to write a treatise on the law of
fixtures. Every lawyer knows that cases can be found in this field that will
support

any position that the facts of his particular case require
him to take. As early as 1899, the court said, in Philadelphia Mortgage &
Trust Co. v.

Miller, 56 P. 382 (Wash. 1899): “there is a wilderness of
authority on this question of fixtures * * * cases, * * * are so conflicting
that it would be

profitless to undertake to review or harmonize them.”

Throughout the trial, the trial judge repeatedly referred to
that case as “the Miller case,” and counsel, in his opening brief, refers to it
as “the

leading case in this jurisdiction.” It held that four
mantels, a bathtub, and a hot water heater connected with the plumbing were not
fixtures. Since

much reliance is placed upon that decision, we will quote
rather freely from the opinion:

Anciently, mantels were uniformly built as a part of the
house, and therefore became a fixture to the realty. * * * But advancing

mechanical science and taste have evolved an altogether
differently constructed mantel, and mantels such as are described by the

testimony in this case are now constructed without reference
to any particular house or particular fireplace. They are what are called

“stock” mantels, and are sold separately, and made adaptive
to any kind of a house. They are, in fact, as much a separate article of

merchandise as a bedstead or a table. * * * The same
advancement has been made in bath tubs. The old-fashioned bath tub, that was

sealed in and actually made a part of the bath room, has
largely given place to the more convenient bath tub, that rests upon legs, and

can be attached to any heating system that happens to
prevail in the house where it is used. And so with heaters or boilers. In this

instance the boiler is in no way attached to the building,
excepting by its plumbing connections. It could be detached without in any

way injuring the realty; * * *. The testimony shows that the
building back of the mantels, or that portion of it which was concealed by

the mantels, was plastered and kalsomined; that for about
three years the mantels were not fastened to the wall in any way, but

supported themselves in the position they occupied, and
that, after that time, they were fastened to the wall by screws, to render them

more stable and keep them from toppling. The boiler and bath
tub were not placed in the building for several years after the mortgage

was given.

It would seem that the court could not very well have held
otherwise than it did, without encroaching upon the province of the jury; for,
it is

further said:

#147

The question of whether or not the particular piece of
furniture or machinery is a chattel or fixture has been held by a majority of

the courts to be a mixed question of law and fact. In this
case the court instructed the jury. These instructions were not excepted to,
and

must be presumed to have correctly stated the law; and, the
jury having found the facts in favor of the respondent, we would be loath

to disturb their findings, unless we were compelled to say
that, as a matter of law, the property sued for was a part of the realty.

Respondents also strongly rely on Hall v. Law Guarantee
& Trust Society, 60 P. 643 (Wash. 1900). The first headnote to this case
reads as

follows:

Gas and electric light fixtures and globes, a windmill, a
hot water tank, curtains, window and door screens, when attached to a

house, are not fixtures as between a mortgagor and a
mortgagee.

Referring to these two cases, the first of which was decided
in 1899, and the second in 190 0, respondents say, in their brief, that they
“have

never been overruled in this state and are the law today.”
Although they may never have been expressly overruled, they at least have been

outmoded. We think it highly improbable that it would now be
held, even in a case between a mortgagor and a mortgagee, that a mantel, or a

bathtub, or an electric hot water heater connected with both
the plumbing and the electrical system is not a fixture. The law relating to
fixtures

has slowly and gradually changed as times have changed.
Various household appliances, not formerly held to be fixtures, have become so
in this

“built-in” era. But the major changes are probably the
result of an awareness of the fact that the luxuries of a given generation
become the

necessities of the next. It seems highly improbable that any
present-day court would hold that a foreclosed mortgagor, on surrendering the

premises, could lawfully disconnect, and take with him, the
household bathtub. * * *

[B]oth Mr. and Mrs. Green categorically testified that they
never had any intention that the chandelier, sidelights, and mirrors should
ever

become fixtures, and that they had removed them, as personal
property, from the former houses in which they had lived. Furthermore, their

testimony was in no way rebutted.

We do not wish it to be understood that we in any way
question the veracity of the respondents, but we are here considering an
alleged rule

that may be involved in future cases, and, treating the
matter wholly impersonally, if a witness testifies that, when he put a
chandelier in a house,

he intended to take it out if he should ever sell the house,
in what possible way can his evidence be disputed? And, passing that, by what
ex post

facto system of mind reading could a purchaser determine the
vendor’s state of mind when he installed the chandelier? There is no evidence

whatever in the instant case that the respondents told the

#148

appellants that they had ever had such an intention until
after the appellants had bought, and paid for, the house. If it held in this
case that the

secret intention of the defendants is determinative of the
question whether or not the articles involved are fixtures, that holding will
encourage

and invite persons less honest than the respondents to
attempt to remove from premises sold every at-all-movable article that can be
disconnected

without breakage.

It has never been the law of this jurisdiction, nor, we
think, of any other, that the secret intention of the owner who affixed the
disputed

article, of itself, determines whether or not it was a
fixture or a mere personal chattel.

[In] Ballard v. Alaska Theatre Co., 161 P. 478, 481 (Wash.
1916) [this Court said]:

The intent is not to be gathered from testimony of the
actual state of the mind of the party making the annexation but is to be

inferred, when not determined by an express agreement, from
the nature of the article affixed, the relation and situation to the freehold

of the party making the annexation, the manner of the
annexation, and the purpose for which it is made.

The case cited in the above quotation [Washington National
Bank v. Smith, 45 P. 736 (Wash. 1896)] was decided fifty years ago, in 1896.

Turning to the opinion in the case, we find the following
statement, 45 P. on page 739:

That the intention with which machinery is placed upon the
real estate is one of the elements to be taken into consideration in

determining whether or not it remains a chattel, or becomes
a part of such real estate, is conceded; but it does not follow that such

intention can be shown by testimony as to the actual state
of the mind of the person who attached the machinery to the real estate at

the time it was attached. On the contrary, his intention
must be gathered from circumstances surrounding the transaction, and from

what was said and done at the time, and cannot be affected
by his state of mind retained as a secret. (Italics ours.)

It is also said, in Ballard v. Alaska Theatre Co., supra:

When the annexation is made by a tenant or licensee the
presumption is that he did not intend to enrich the freehold, but intended

to reserve title to the chattel annexed in himself, while
from an annexation by the owner of the property, the presumption is the other

way. [Citing cases.] It therefore often happens that the
same character of article annexed to the realty in the same way will be held to

be a trade fixture and removable when annexed by a tenant,
but real property and not removable when annexed by the owner of the

property.

#149

The opinion in Hall v. Dare, 252 P. 926, 928 (Wash. 1927),
by reference, approves the rule laid down in Filley v. Christopher, 80 P. 834

(Wash. 1905), in which it is said:

The true criterion of a fixture is the united application of
these requisites: (1) Actual annexation to the realty, or something

appurtenant thereto; (2) application to the use or purpose
to which that part of the realty with which it is connected is appropriated;
and

(3) the intention of the party making the annexation to make
a permanent accession to the freehold.

Respondents in this case were owners when they installed the
articles in question. The presumption, then, is (as held in the last of the

quotations hitherto made from Ballard v. Alaska Theatre Co.,
supra) that it was their intention to enrich the freehold. This presumption is
not

overcome by evidence of secret intention, as is shown by the
first of the quotations hitherto made from the same case, and then more plainly
by

the other quotation to the same effect from Washington
National Bank v. Smith. Nor is the fact that the respondents successfully
removed the

articles from house to house of much, if any, probative
value.

The chandelier and sidelights were actually annexed to the
realty, and, clearly, for the use or purpose of that part of the realty (the
house)

with which they were connected. Their purpose, of course,
was to make it livable. The fact that such articles are universally called
“light

fixtures,” is, though not determinative, some evidence that
they are fixtures. The fact that, after removing the chandelier and sidelights,
the

respondents replaced them with others, amounts to an implied
admission on their part that a house without light fixtures would not be a
complete

house. In our opinion, the chandelier and sidelights were
fixtures in law and in fact.

The mirrors—at least two of them—present a much closer
question. We are satisfied that there is no adequate proof that the powder room

mirror was physically annexed to the realty, and as to that
mirror, which seems to have been the most valuable of the three, we need not
inquire

further. It was not a fixture. The others present a unique
situation. Each of them could be taken down from the respective walls by
removing a

few screws, but in each case that would leave on the wall a
large square of plywood which could not be removed, in the one case, without

damaging the plaster, and, in the other, without leaving
some damage by nail holes, and a portion of the wall of a different shade. We
have

arrived at the opinion that each of these mirrors and its
plywood backing should be regarded as one article, and that in each case that
article

should be regarded as having been a portion of the house
walls, and that, as such, they went with the house to the purchasers by the
warranty

deed which contained no reservations whatsoever.

#150

Except as to the powder room mirror, the judgment, in so far
as appealed from, is reversed, and the cause remanded to the trial court for
the

entry of judgment in accordance herewith.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Disputes over whether things are personal property or
fixtures arise with some regularity and in several different contexts. One
context,

represented by the principal case, is when A sells real
property to B, and a dispute arises as to whether particular things associated
with the property are

personal property belonging to A, or fixtures belonging to
B. Another context is when C leases an apartment from D, and a dispute arises
at the end of

the lease over whether particular things C has added to the
apartment are personal property belonging to C, or fixtures belonging to the
landlord D. A

third context is when E takes out a loan secured by a
mortgage on real estate with bank F, and a dispute arises over whether certain
things E has added to

the property are within the scope of F’s security interest
when E defaults on the loan.

2 .The name “fixtures” implies that only items of personal
property that are securely affixed to the land will be regarded as going with
the land, but

courts have long recognized that other variables are
relevant as well. In what is still the most widely cited American case, the
court in _Teaff v. Hew_ itt, 1

Ohio 511 , 1853 WL 54 ( 1853 ), held that three factors
should be considered: ( 1 ) “actual annexation to the realty, or something
appurtenant thereto;” ( 2 )

“appropriation to the use or purpose of that part of the
realty with which it is connected;” and ( 3 ) “the intention of the party
making the annexation, to

make the article a permanent accession to the freehold.” 1
Ohio at 10 ; 1853 WL at 530. Many courts today regard the last factor—the
intent of the party

making the annexation—as the most importation, although
intent is to be determined objectively, by considering other factors such as
affixation and the

functional importance of the thing in terms of its use on
the property.

3 .Although the same doctrine nominally applies in each of
the different contexts in which the issue arises, many observers believe that
judges lean

one way or another in close cases depending on the context.
There is a hint of this in _Strain_ when the court observes that mantels,
bathtubs, and water

heaters would most probably be regarded as fixtures “even in
a case between a mortgagor and a mortgagee,” suggesting that courts would be
more likely

to consider something as personal property in that context.
If true, do you think this is because courts are more sympathetic to some
classes of claimants

(purchasers, tenants, and borrowers) and less sympathetic to
others (sellers, landlords, lenders)? Or can the differences be explained, as
the principal

case suggests, by different presumptions about the likely
intentions of persons in these different contexts?

4 .Is fixtures doctrine just a default rule to be applied in
determining the intentions of the parties to a bilateral contract? If so, can
it really be said

to be a doctrine about the composition of property rights?
Or does the doctrine have certain applications that run counter to the parties’
intentions,

making it an example of how someone—an owner of land—can
acquire

```



151



```

objects that originally were personal property belonging to
someone else, who had no intention to make a voluntary conveyance?

5 .Although Hume does not mention the law of fixtures, the
doctrine can be explained in terms of his theory of the principle of accession.
In

particular, psychological perceptions seem to play a
substantial role in fixtures cases. Consider the different disposition the
court reaches in _Strain_ with

regard to the mirrors in the dining room and living room,
and the mirror in the powder room. The same intention and relationship among
the parties

exists with respect to each of the mirrors. The only
difference is that the mirrors in the dining room and living room were attached
to the plywood by

screws, whereas the mirror in the powder room was hung by
wire from a hook. The greater connectedness or proximity between the attached
mirrors

and the real property causes the court to conclude they are
fixtures, i.e., they belong to the owner of the real property, whereas the
looser connection

between the hung mirror and the realty causes the court to
conclude it is personal property.

### 6 .ACCRETION AND AVULSION

#### Nebraska v. Iowa

```



Supreme Court of the United States, 1892.



143 U.S. 359.



```

This is an original suit, brought in this court by the state
of Nebraska against the state of Iowa, the object of which is to have the
boundary

line between the two states determined. Iowa was admitted
into the Union in 1846, and its western boundary, as defined by the act of
admission,

was the middle of the main channel of the Missouri river.
Nebraska was admitted in 1867, and its eastern boundary was likewise the middle
of

the channel of the Missouri river. Between 1851 and 1877, in
the vicinity of Omaha, there were marked changes in the course of this channel,
so

that in the latter year it occupied a very different bed
from that through which it flowed in the former year. Out of these changes has
come this

litigation, the respective states claiming jurisdiction over
the same tract of land. * * *

■ MR.
JUSTICE BREWER, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered
the opinion of the court. It is settled law that when grants of

land border on running water, and the banks are changed by
that gradual process known as “accretion,” the riparian owner’s boundary line
still

remains the stream, although, during the years, by this
accretion, the actual area of his possessions may vary. In New Orleans v.
United States , 35

U.S. (10 Pet.) 662, 717 (1836), this court said: “The
question is well settled at common law, that the person whose land is bounded
by a stream of

water which changes its course gradually by alluvial
formations shall still hold by the same boundary, including the accumulated
soil. No other

rule can be applied on just principles. Every proprietor
whose land is thus bounded is subject to loss by the same

#152

means which may add to his territory; and, as he is without
remedy for his loss in this way, he cannot be held accountable for his gain.”

It is equally well settled that where a stream, which is a
boundary, from any cause suddenly abandons its old and seeks a new bed, such

change of channel works no change of boundary; and that the
boundary remains as it was, in the center of the old channel, although no water

may be flowing therein. This sudden and rapid change of
channel is termed, in the law, “avulsion.” In Gould on Waters, sec. 159, it is
said: “But

if the change is violent and visible, and arises from a
known cause, such as a freshet, or a cut through which a new channel is formed,
the original

thread of the stream continues to mark the limits of the two
estates.”

These propositions, which are universally recognized as
correct where the boundaries of private property touch on streams, are in like

manner recognized where the boundaries between states or
nations are, by prescription or treaty, found in running water. Accretion, no
matter to

which side it adds ground, leaves the boundary still the
center of the channel. Avulsion has no effect on boundary, but leaves it in the
center of

the old channel. * * *

The result of these authorities puts it beyond doubt that
accretion on an ordinary river would leave the boundary between two states the

varying center of the channel, and that avulsion would
establish a fixed boundary, to-wit, the center of the abandoned channel. It is
contended,

however, that the doctrine of accretion has no application
to the Missouri river * * * because of the peculiar character of that stream,
and of the

soil through which it flows, the course of the river being
tortuous, the current rapid, and the soil a soft, sandy loam, not protected
from the action

of water either by rocks or the roots of trees; the effect
being that the river cuts away its banks, sometimes in a large body, and makes
for itself a

new course, while the earth thus removed is almost
simultaneously deposited elsewhere, and new land is formed almost as rapidly as
the former

bank was carried a way. * * * “The test as to what is
gradual and imperceptible in the sense of the rule is that, though the
witnesses may see from

time to time that progress has been made, they could not
perceive it while the process was going on.” [quoting Jefferis v. East Omaha
Land Co.,

134 U.S. 178, 190 (1890), quoting in turn County of St.
Clair v. Lovingston, 90 U.S. (23 Wall.) 46, 68 (1874)]. * * *

But what are the facts apparent from [the] testimony? The
Missouri river is a winding stream, coursing through a valley of varying width,

the substratum of whose soil, a deposit of distant
centuries, is largely of quicksand. In building the bridge of the Union Pacific
Railway Company

across the Missouri river in the vicinity of the tracts in
controversy, the builders went down to the solid rock, 65 feet below the
surface, and there

found a pine log a foot and a half in diameter—of course, a
deposit made in the long ago. The current is rapid, far above the average of
ordinary

rivers; and by reason of the snows in the mountains there
are two well-

#153

known rises in the volume of its waters, known as the April
and June rises. The large volume of water pouring down at the time of these
rises,

with the rapidity of its current, has great and rapid action
upon the loose soil of its banks. Whenever it impinges with direct attack upon
the bank

at a bend of the stream, and that bank is of the loose sand
obtaining in the valley of the Missouri, it is not strange that the abrasion
and washing

away is rapid and great. Frequently, where above the loose
substratum of sand there is a deposit of comparatively solid soil, the washing
out of

the underlying sand causes an instantaneous fall of quite a
length and breadth of the superstratum of soil into the river; so that it may,
in one

sense of the term, be said, that the diminution of the banks
is not gradual and imperceptible, but sudden and visible. Notwithstanding this,
two

things must be borne in mind, familiar to all dwellers on
the banks of the Missouri river, and disclosed by the testimony: that, while
there may be

an instantaneous and obvious dropping into the river of
quite a portion of its banks, such portion is not carried down the stream as a
solid and

compact mass, but disintegrates and separates into particles
of earth borne onward by the flowing water, and giving to the stream that
color,

which, in the history of the country, has made it known as
the “muddy” Missouri; and also that, while the disappearance, by reason of this

process, of a mass of bank may be sudden and obvious, there
is no transfer of such a solid body of earth to the opposite shore, or anything
like an

instantaneous and visible creation of a bank on that shore.
The accretion, whatever may be the fact in respect to the diminution, is always

gradual, and by the imperceptible deposit of floating
particles of earth. There is, except in such cases of avulsion as may be
noticed hereafter, in

all matter of increase of bank, always a mere gradual and
imperceptible process. There is no heaping up at an instant, and while the eye
rests

upon the stream, of acres or rods on the forming side of the
river. No engineering skill is sufficient to say where the earth in the bank
washed

away and disintegrating into the river finds its rest and
abiding place. The falling bank has passed into the floating mass of earth and
water, and

the particles of earth may rest one or fifty miles below,
and upon either shore. There is, no matter how rapid the process of subtraction
or

addition, no detachment of earth from the one side and
deposit of the same upon the other. The only thing which distinguishes this
river from

other streams, in the matter of accretion, is in the
rapidity of the change, caused by the velocity of the current, and this in
itself, in the very nature

of things, works no change in the principle underlying the
rule of law in respect thereto.

Our conclusions are that, notwithstanding the rapidity of
the changes in the course of the channel, and the washing from the one side and

onto the other, the law of accretion controls on the
Missouri river as elsewhere; and that not only in respect to the rights of
individual

landowners, but also in respect to the boundary lines
between states. The boundary, therefore, between Iowa and Nebraska is a varying
line, so

far

#154

as affected by these changes of diminution and accretion in
the mere washing of the waters of the stream.

It appears, however, from the testimony, that in 1877 the
river above Omaha, which had pursued a course in the nature of an ox-bow,

suddenly cut through the neck of the bow and made for itself
a new channel. This does not come within the law of accretion, but of that of

avulsion. By this selection of a new channel the boundary
was not changed, and it remained, as it was prior to the avulsion, the center
line of the

old channel; and that, unless the waters of the river
returned to their former bed, became a fixed and unvarying boundary, no matter
what might

be the changes of the river in its new channel.

We think we have, by these observations, indicated as
clearly as is possible the boundary between the two states, and upon these
principles

the parties may agree to a designation of such boundary, and
such designation will pass into a final decree. If no agreement is possible,
then the

court will appoint a commission to survey and report in
accordance with the views herein expressed.

Iowa-Nebraska Border

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .As the Court explains, _accretion_ refers to the “gradual
deposit by water of solid material, whether mud, sand, or sediment, producing
dry land

which was before covered by water”; and _avulsion_ “is the
sudden change of the banks of a stream such as occurs when a river forms a new
course by

going through a bend, the sudden abandonment by a stream of
its old

```



155



```

channel and the creation of a new one, or a sudden washing
away from one of its banks of a considerable quantity of land and its deposit
on the opposite

bank.” 3 American Law of Property § 15. 26 , at 855 – 56 (A.
Casner ed., 1952 ). Other terms sometimes encountered are _reliction_ , which
refers to “land

that has been covered by water, but which has been uncovered
by the imperceptible recession of the water;” and _erosion,_ which “is the
gradual and

imperceptible wearing away of land (bordering on water) by
the natural action of the elements.” Id. Two other terms that arise in this
context are

_riparian_ , which refers to “land bordering on any type of
water—rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, and arms of the ocean,” and _littoral,_
which refers more

properly to land bordering the ocean or a major inland sea.
Id.

2 .Accretion, reliction, and erosion are all governed by the
same rule. Owners of riparian land that is augmented through the operation of
accretion

or reliction automatically gain title to the new land.
Owners of riparian land that is diminished due to erosion automatically lose
title to the lost land.

This is a rule of law, not just a rule of construction or a
default rule. Avulsion, as explained in the principal case, results in no
change of boundary lines.

What do you suppose happens when the opposite of reliction
occurs, that is, when dry land is gradually inundated by a new body of standing
water?

3 .Like the rule of increase, the rules of accretion and
avulsion are quite universally followed. They date from Roman law, and are
apparently

followed in virtually all civil-law and common-law
jurisdictions. As the principal case suggests, they form part of the
international law of boundaries as

well as the law of property. The law of accretion and
avulsion featured in a recent U.S. Supreme Court case about the possibility of
judicial takings. (See

Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v. Florida Department of
Environmental Protection, excerpted in Chapter X, infra.)

4 .Hume, supra, mentions the rule of accretion as an example
of the principle of accession. One can see the logic of this. Deposits of sand
and mud

imperceptibly added to riparian land are imagined to belong
to the riparian landowner, because the deposits are “small” and the existing
riparian land is

“large,” and the deposits are directly attached to the
existing land. So the riparian landowner is regarded as the most prominent
existing source of

property rights to which to assign ownership of the new
deposits added by accretion. But can Hume’s psychological theory also account
for the

exception to the rule that governs avulsions? Is avulsion
different because it typically involves a change that features a clear winner
and loser, whereas

accretion, erosion, and reliction have either a winner or a
loser but no identifiable party on the opposite side of the ledger?

### F. ADVERSE POSSESSION

Our final illustration of the importance of possession is
the law of adverse possession. Courts have long held that when an owner sits on
her

right to exclude, and the statute of limitations for
challenging the original unlawful entry expires, not only is the original owner
barred from

asserting the right to exclude but the adverse possessor now
has full

#156

title. In effect, the adverse possessor becomes the new true
owner, and can now exercise the right to exclude against all the world,
including the

original owner. Adverse possession applies to both real and
personal property, and we provide cases illustrating both applications. If the
owner

fails to prevent someone from using the property for a
particular purpose, as opposed to possessing it, and the statute of limitations
runs, then this

can give rise to a prescriptive easement. We take up this
doctrine in Chapter IX.

#### Scott v. Anderson-Tully Co.

```



Court of Appeals of Mississippi, 2015.



154 So. 3 d 910.



```

■
BARNES, J. Herman Scott (Scott) filed suit seeking damages after Anderson-Tully
Company removed timber from a twenty-acre parcel of land

Scott claimed to own. Scott also sought to quiet and confirm
title and to enjoin Anderson-Tully from entering the land. The chancellor
dismissed

Scott’s claim, finding that Anderson-Tully had acquired
title to the twenty acres through adverse possession. Scott appeals, arguing
the

chancellor erred. We find no error and affirm.

In 1925, brothers Stewart Scott Jr. and Willie Scott
inherited an undivided one-half interest in a 584.6-acre tract of land in
Jefferson County,

Mississippi. The brothers’ respective estates now each own
the undivided one-half-interest shares in the property (collectively referred
to as “the

estate”). Scott, the plaintiff, is the administrator of
Stewart Scott Jr.’s estate.

On March 19, 2010, Scott filed suit on behalf of the estate
in Jefferson County Chancery Court, alleging that its adjacent landowner to the

east, Anderson-Tully, was trespassing on a portion of the
estate’s property. Scott sought damages for the removal of timber, and he
sought an

order enjoining Anderson-Tully from entering onto or cutting
and removing timber from the property. An amended complaint sought to quiet and

confirm title. The disputed property is a somewhat
triangular-shaped tract of land located in the northeastern corner of Section
28, Township 10

North, Range 1 East in Jefferson County.^1 Scott claims that
the estate owns all property in Section 28, including the disputed acreage east
of the

wire fence, up to the section line between Sections 28 and
30.

Anderson-Tully answered the complaint and counterclaimed to
quiet and confirm its own title. Anderson-Tully claimed that according to its

deed, it owned the disputed twenty acres in Section 28 east
of the wire fence. Alternatively, Anderson-Tully argued that it acquired title
to the

#157

property by adverse possession through its possession and
use of the land from 1969 to 2010.

A trial was held, at which Scott presented the testimony of
Richard T. Logan of Logan Engineering Company. Scott had hired Logan in

2003 to determine the estate’s acreage after Scott became
concerned that he was paying taxes on more property than the estate owned.
Logan

found that the estate owned all of Section 28, including the
disputed twenty acres. Logan relied on his personal inspection of the property
and a

plat prepared in 1944 by B.G. Miller, the county surveyor
for Jefferson County at that time. Miller’s plat was prepared for a timber deed
from the

Scotts, and is the only recorded description of the Scotts’
land in evidence. Miller’s plat reflects difficulty in surveying the area,
noting that the

southern line of the Scotts’ tract “has never been
accurately determined but will not vary as much as 5 acres.” Miller found that
the Scotts’

property line on the east ran along the section line between
Section 28 and Section 30. He noted the wire fence on the east side of the
Scotts’

property and found that the “20 1/10 [acres] outside of
fence is included in total acreage.” However, Miller also made a note on the
plat, within

the twenty acres, which states that the property is “outside
of fence & may be disputed.” Logan agreed with Miller’s finding that the
section line,

not the fence line, was the property’s border and that the
twenty acres belonged to the Scotts. Logan walked the disputed property and
stated that

the terrain to the east of the fence was “very rough.” He
found the wire fence was never intended to establish the property’s border, but
rather

was a “convenience fence,” or “tree[-]line fence,” built to
contain livestock. Although other witnesses testified to seeing blue paint
along the wire

fence that was indicative of Anderson-Tully’s ownership,
Logan testified that he did not recall seeing any blue paint when he surveyed
the

property. However, he also testified that he no longer had
his field notes and was relying on his memory. Logan examined Anderson-Tully’s
deed

and found no conveyance of any land in Section 28 to
Anderson-Tully.

Richard Scott, an heir of Stewart Scott Jr., lived on the
Scott property from his birth in 1938 until 1953. He testified he rebuilt the
old wire

fence on the east side of the property in 1954 because it
was in need of repair. When he rebuilt the fence, he moved it a foot or two to
the west,

along the tree line, because the posts had rotted and he
wanted to avoid digging new post holes. According to Richard, the fence was
built to

contain livestock and was not the property’s border. After
moving from the property in 1953, he returned every week or two to visit his
father. Up

until 2 010, he would ride horses around the property when
he visited, and would sometimes make repairs to the fence. He never saw anyone

using the disputed twenty acres.

Anderson-Tully presented the testimony of its company
surveyor and forester, E.C. Burkhardt. Burkhardt worked for Anderson-Tully from

the early 1950s to 1981. Burkhardt testified that
Anderson-Tully

#158

came into possession of the disputed tract on February 12,
1969, though quitclaim deed. The deed does not contain a metes-and-bounds

description or plat. According to Burkhardt, when
Anderson-Tully expressed interest in buying the Jefferson County land in 1969,
no one,

including the land’s owners, knew the acreage. Burkhardt
explained that the acreage was unclear because the land in Jefferson County was
some

of the first land south of Ohio to be surveyed by the United
States government in 1805. After complaints about irregularities, the
government

retraced the original lines to get the correct acreage, and
it established the sectional descriptions. After this, the “southwest part of
Mississippi

more or less reverted to the metes[-]and[-]bounds system.”
But Burkhardt testified that because the section lines are irregular,
determining

property lines can be difficult. So, according to Burkhardt,
when surveying in the area, the “best evidence is what you find out there on
the

ground.... You’ve got to pay attention to the lines on the
ground, evidence of possession; and quite often that’s all you’ve really got to
go by to

determine boundary lines.” Burkhardt’s 1969 survey found
that the boundary line between the Scotts’ and Anderson-Tully’s properties ran
along

the wire fence, making the disputed twenty acres part of
Anderson-Tully’s property. Burkhardt placed flags and stakes and used blue
paint to

mark the boundary line along the fence. Burkhardt’s field
notes reference conversations with neighboring property owners, including a
Scott

family member, none of whom objected to his placement of
flags and stakes during his survey.

Anderson-Tully admitted Burkhardt’s description, which is
set out in its deed, does not specifically mention a conveyance of any land in

Section 28—the location of the disputed property. But it
argues the property “is included in the description... by reference” in the
“catch-all

portion of the description for the Hollywood Tract... .” * *
*

Anderson-Tully alternatively argued that if the deed did not
convey the property, it owned the property through adverse possession. Starting

at the time of purchase in 1969, Anderson-Tully marked its
perceived boundary line along the wire fence with a particular shade of blue
paint—a

practice started by the company in the 1920s. The line was
repainted in 1986 and 1998. Witnesses testified that the blue line along the
fence was

visible continuously from 1969 through 2010, when Scott
filed suit. Witnesses also testified that the particular shade of blue paint
was commonly

known in the community as that of Anderson-Tully. From 1969
to 2010, Anderson-Tully maintained the disputed acreage and cut and harvested

timber in 1990, 1999, and 2010. The company also issued five
hunting licenses to the property. Burkhardt testified that from 1969 until the
end

of his employment with Anderson-Tully in 1 981, no one
objected to his survey or interfered with Anderson-Tully’s ownership or use of
the

disputed tract. Burkhardt testified that if someone had
regularly crossed the blue line, he would have been notified. He was never
notified that the

line had been crossed by anyone.

#159

Wilbur Nations, upon whom much of the chancellor’s decision
relied, testified for Anderson-Tully in regard to its adverse-possession claim.

Nations was ninety years old when he testified, and “sharp
as a tack,” according to the chancellor. Nations, coincidently, was a licensed
surveyor

in Alabama. Nations testified that he grew up on what he
referred to as the Hollywood tract, just east of the Scotts’ land. He lived
there from

1929 to 1942, and after that would return on weekends to
visit through the mid-1950s. According to Nations, the wire fence was
recognized by

the community as the property line, and Anderson-Tully was
the owner of the property to the east of the fence. Nations testified that the
Scotts

had never used the disputed tract. His family, however, had
used the Hollywood tract, including the disputed twenty acres, to run cattle,
and they

had cut timber on it. Nations recalled that as late as 1993,
the Scotts cut timber up to and west of the fence line, but they never cut east
of the

fence line. He saw blue paint marking the property’s
boundary along the fence in 1980 and 1985, and again three weeks before trial.
He

recognized the paint color as that used by Anderson-Tully to
mark its borders.

In 1982, Nations joined the Linwood Hunting Club, which
leased hunting land from Anderson-Tully beginning in 1972. Nations was

present on the property yearly during hunting season
(November–January) and throughout the year on the weekends working on roads and
deer

stands. He testified that the hunting-club members
recognized the fence as the boundary line and were aware of the blue paint used
by Anderson-

Tully to mark its property’s borders. From 1995 to 2007,
Linwood also leased a portion of the Scotts’ property. In 2007, Scott informed
Linwood

that he would not renew the lease for the 2007–2008 hunting
season. A dispute arose between a Linwood member and Scott as to the ownership

of the twenty-acre tract to the east of the fence line.
Subsequently, in December 2008, Anderson-Tully’s attorney sent Scott a letter
stating

Anderson-Tully was the owner of the disputed tract. Scott
consulted an attorney in 2009, but no legal action was taken at that time.
Anderson-

Tully continued to treat the land as its own, and harvested
timber there in early 2010. Scott approached a logger who was on the disputed
tract

and told him to stop harvesting the timber on the land. The
logger replied that he would need something in writing to prove Anderson-Tully
was

not the owner and then continued harvesting. This led to
Scott’s complaint filed on March 19, 2010.

After reviewing the parties’ property descriptions, the
chancellor concluded that neither “accurately describe[s] the disputed tract to
any

certainty so as to read the various descriptions and know
which party is the record title owner of the property.” However, the chancellor
found

that “the evidence overwhelmingly support[ed]” a finding of
adverse possession in favor of Anderson-Tully. * * *

This Court “must defer to a chancery court’s findings of
fact unless they are manifestly wrong or clearly erroneous.” Double J Farmlands

(Miss. 2008). * * *

Scott argues Anderson-Tully presented insufficient evidence
to prove a claim of adverse possession. Mississippi Code Annotated section

15–1–13(1) (Rev. 2012) states:

Ten (10) years’ actual adverse possession by any person
claiming to be the owner for that time of any land, uninterruptedly continued

for ten (10) years by occupancy, descent, conveyance, or
otherwise, in whatever way such occupancy may have commenced or

continued, shall vest in every actual occupant or possessor
of such land a full and complete title[.]

“[F]or possession to be adverse[,] it must be (1) under
claim of ownership; (2) actual or hostile; (3) open, notorious, and visible;
(4) continuous

and uninterrupted for a period of ten years; (5) exclusive;
and (6) peaceful.” Blackburn v. Wong, 904 So.2d 134, 136 (¶ 15) (Miss.2004)
(citing

Thornhill v. Caroline Hunt Trust Estate, 594 So.2d 1 150, 1
152–53 (Miss.1992)). The claimant must prove each element by clear and
convincing

evidence. Id.

1.Claim of Ownership

To stake a claim of ownership, the possessor must “fly [his]
flag over the property” in such a way as to put the actual owner on notice that

the property is “being held under an adverse claim of
ownership.” Apperson v. White, 950 So.2d 11 13, 1117 (¶ 7) (Miss. Ct. App.
2007) (citing

Walker v. Murphree, 722 So.2d 1277, 1281 (¶ 16) (Miss. Ct.
App. 1998)). The quality, not the quantity, of acts must be considered. Id. at
(¶ 8).

“The mere presence of a fence, without more, [is not]
sufficient to sustain a claim of adverse possession.” Double J, 999 So.2d at
829.

After purchasing the Jefferson County property in 1969,
Anderson-Tully marked its borders with its recognizable company blue paint. The

blue paint ran along the wire fence erected by the Scott
family and included the disputed twenty acres in Section 28. Multiple witnesses
saw the

paint lines between 1969 and 2010, and knew the lines marked
the boundary of Anderson-Tully’s property. Thomas Middleton, a forester,

performed a timber cruise at Scott’s request in 2010 to
establish damages for Anderson-Tully’s removal of trees from the disputed
acreage. He

testified that the fence line was “distinctly painted” with
blue paint. The blue paint was two different shades, indicating to him that the
line had

been repainted at some point. He was familiar with the blue
boundary lines in the area, and he knew that the paint color was the one used
by

Anderson-Tully to mark its property lines. Anderson-Tully’s
company records show that it painted the blue line in 1969, and repainted it in
1986

and 1998. Anderson-Tully cut and harvested timber in 1990,
1999, and 2010. It also conducted timber-stand improvements to clear the land

#161

of unwanted trees, and granted five hunting licenses to the
property. The hunting licenses contained maps, which described the disputed
twenty

acres as part of the lease.

Scott asserts that regardless of Anderson-Tully’s actions,
the estate has a possessory claim because he began paying property taxes on the

disputed tract in 1993. The chancellor found Scott presented
insufficient evidence to support his claim that he paid taxes on the disputed

property. Regardless, the payment of taxes alone “is not
dispositive of the claim of ownership.” Nosser v. Buford , 852 So.2d 57, 61 (¶
17) (Miss.

Ct. App. 2002). Thus, we cannot find the chancellor erred in
finding no merit to Scott’s argument. We find the evidence sufficient to
support the

chancellor’s finding that Anderson-Tully staked an ownership
claim to the property from 1969 to 2010.

2.Actual or Hostile

“Possession is hostile and adverse when the adverse
possessor intends to claim title notwithstanding that the claim is made under a
mistaken

belief that the land is within the calls of the possessor’s
deed.” Wicker v. Harvey, 937 So.2d 983, 994 (¶ 34) (Miss. Ct. App. 2006)
(citing

Alexander v. Hyland, 58 So.2d 826, 829 (Miss. 1952)). The
adverse possessor must possess the property without the owner’s permission,

because permission defeats any claim of adverse possession.

Anderson-Tully marked, managed, harvested timber, and issued
hunting licenses on the disputed property from 1969 to 2010. Anderson-

Tully did not seek anyone’s permission to use the property.
Nations testified that everyone, including the Scotts, treated the wire fence
as the

dividing line between the properties as early as the 1930s.
He recalled that as late as 1993, the Scotts cut timber only to the west of the
fence line,

but not to its east. The testimony established that after
1969, only Anderson-Tully used the disputed property.

Scott argues Anderson-Tully did not actually or hostilely
possess the property because it did not care for or improve the land on a
regular

basis. “As a general rule, either actual or constructive
occupation, cultivation or residence or use is necessary to constitute adverse
possession.”

Kayser v. Dixon , 309 So.2d 526, 528–29 (Miss. 1975).
However, “[p]ossessory acts necessary to establish a claim of adverse
possession may

vary with the characteristics of the land, and adverse
possession of ‘wild’ or unimproved lands may be established by evidence of acts
that would

be wholly insufficient in the case of improved or developed
lands.” Apperson , 950 So.2d at 1117 (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted).

The property in question is undisputedly wild or unimproved
land. Thus, “the quantum of proof necessary... to establish adverse possession

over the disputed parcel is measurably lower than had the
property been improved or developed.” Id. “Possession of such [undeveloped]
property

may be established by a continued claim evidenced by public
acts of ownership.” Kayser , 309 So.2d at 529. Anderson-Tully marked the fence

line with blue paint in 1969, 1986, and 1998. It cut and
harvested timber

#162

in 199 0, 1999, and 2010. It performed timber-stand
improvements, and it issued five hunting licenses. We find the chancellor had
substantial

support in the evidence to find that these acts were public
acts of ownership sufficient to establish an actual or hostile claim of
ownership.

3.Open, Notorious, and Visible

For possession to be open, notorious, and visible, the
possessor “must unfurl his flag on the land, and keep it flying, so that the
actual owner

may see, and if he will, that an enemy has invaded his
domains, and planted the standard of conquest.” Roberts v. Young’s Creek Inv.
Inc. , 118

So.3d 665, 670 (Miss.Ct.App.2013) (quoting Wicker , 937
So.2d at 994).

The chancellor found Anderson-Tully openly and notoriously
possessed the land from 1969, when it painted its boundary lines blue, until

2010, when Scott filed suit. The possession was visible, as
evidenced by eyewitnesses who saw the blue paint along the fence line between
1969

and 20 10. The possession was also notorious, as the fence
and blue paint were recognized in the community as the dividing line between
the

properties. In addition to marking its borders with blue
paint, Anderson-Tully cut and harvested timber, performed timber-stand
improvements,

and issued hunting licenses on the property. All of which
were open, notorious, and visible to the public. Glynn Brown, Anderson-Tully’s

regional manager over land in Jefferson County, testified
that in 1990 and 1999, when timber was cut, Anderson-Tully accessed the
disputed

property through the Scotts’ property. Each time, the
timber-cutting process took approximately a month. No one objected to their
entering or

cutting timber on the property. Nations testified that when
loggers came onto the property, he could hear the timber being cut “a half a
mile”

away. This evidence supports the chancellor’s finding that
Anderson-Tully’s use was open, notorious, and visible.

4.Continuous and Uninterrupted for a Period of Ten Years

Adverse possession requires continuous and uninterrupted
possession of a disputed property for at least ten years. Miss. Code Ann. §
15–1–

13(1). Even if a party is mistaken as to the calls of his
deed, “if he has occupied the land for the statutory period under the claim
that it was his

own and was embraced within the calls of his deed, he is
entitled to recover on the ground of adverse possession[.]” Pittman v. Simmons,
408

So.2d 1384, 1386 (Miss. 1982) (quoting Alexander, 58 So.2d
at 829).

Anderson-Tully’s possession began upon issuance of its deed
in 1969. After marking its perceived boundary lines with blue paint, it

proceeded to maintain the property, harvest timber, and
issue hunting licenses. Nations testified that everyone, including the Scotts,
treated the

fence as the dividing line and that the Scotts never used
the property east of the fence. Burkhardt testified that during his employment
with

Anderson-Tully from 1969 to 1981, he was never notified that
anyone other than Anderson-Tully crossed the blue line.

#163

Scott argues the possession was not continuous and
uninterrupted because he disputed Anderson-Tully’s possession in 2003. The
chancellor

recognized Scott’s objection in 2003. The chancellor also
noted that at some point, Scott painted an orange line along the fence line,
although it

was unclear when this was done. Finally, the chancellor
found Scott made an indirect claim of ownership in 2007, when he cancelled the

Linwood Hunting Club lease. However, the chancellor found
these actions of no consequence, as Anderson-Tully’s adverse-possession claim
had

ripened before Scott made the first objection in 2003. The
evidence supports the chancellor’s finding that Anderson-Tully’s possession was

continuous and uninterrupted for ten years.

5.Exclusive

“Exclusive possession means that the possessor ‘evinces an
intention to possess and hold land to the exclusion of, and in opposition to,
the

claims of all others, and the claimant’s conduct must afford
an unequivocal indication that he is exercising the dominion of a sole owner.’
”

Roberts, 118 So.3d at 671 (quoting Wicker, 937 So.2d at
995). Exclusive possession “does not mean that no one else can use the
property.” Id.

(citing Apperson, 950 So.2d at 1 1 19).

No testimony was presented that the Scotts or anyone other
than Anderson-Tully used the property on the east side of the fence after 1969.

Scott argues Anderson-Tully “allowed the Scott [family] to
lease the disputed 20 acres to [the Linwood Hunting Club].” However, no
evidence

was presented to support this argument. To the contrary,
Anderson-Tully maintained that it leased the twenty acres to the hunting club,
and it

provided evidence of contracts with plats attached that
included the twenty acres. Nations maintained that the Scotts only used the
property to the

west of the fence line; and Burkhardt testified he would
have been notified if anyone had regularly crossed the blue line onto the
twenty acres

during his employment at Anderson-Tully. No one did. Thus,
the evidence supports the chancellor’s finding that the possession for the
statutory

ten-year period was exclusive.

6.Peaceful

An adverse possessor’s use of a claimed property must be
peaceful. Miss. Code Ann. § 15–1–13(1). “[E]xpected disputes associated with

the use or ownership of the property are not indicative of
the possession not being peaceful.” Roberts , 118 So.3d at 671. Burkhardt
testified that

from 1969 to 1981, no one objected to his survey or
interfered with Anderson-Tully’s ownership or use of the disputed tract. Scott
argues

Anderson-Tully’s possession was not peaceful because it
acted without consent in removing the timber. However, as stated, the first
time Scott

disputed Anderson-Tully’s use of the land was in 2003, well
after Anderson-Tully’s adverse-possession claim had ripened. Thus, we find

sufficient evidence in the record to support the
chancellor’s finding that Anderson-Tully’s possession was peaceful. * * *

#164

Anderson-Tully openly and notoriously possessed the disputed
twenty-acre tract in Jefferson County from 1969 until Scott’s complaint was

filed in 201 0. It marked its perceived boundary line with
blue paint when it purchased the property in 1969, and repainted the boundary
line in

1986 and 1998. It managed timber uninterruptedly from 1969
to 2010 and harvested timber in 1990, 1999, and 2010. No testimony was

presented that the Scotts or anyone else used the disputed
property after 1969. We find substantial evidence in the record to support the

chancellor’s finding that Anderson-Tully proved adverse
possession by clear and convincing evidence. Therefore, we find the chancellor
did not

abuse his discretion and affirm.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The doctrine of adverse possession evolved from judicial
decisions resolving disputes over the application of the statute of limitations
for

recovery of possession of property. Assume the true owner of
property (TO) is for some reason out of possession. She is, say, an absentee
owner of land

holding it for speculation, or has lost some personal
property. Meanwhile, someone else, say a squatter or a finder or other type of
adverse possessor

(AP), has come into possession of the property. The TO has
various causes of action allowing her to recover possession of property from an
AP, such as

ejectment in the case of land and replevin in the case of
personal property (see Chapter IV). But she cannot wait forever to bring such
an action. The

legislature (Parliament in England or the legislatures of
the American states) typically will have enacted statutes of limitations that
bar the bringing of

such actions after a certain number of years have passed.
The time for bringing an action to recover possession of real property varies
widely from state

to state, from a low of five years to a high of 40 years.
See Joseph William Singer, Introduction to Property § 4. 2. 6 ( 5 th ed. 2017
). The time period for

bringing an action in replevin to recover personal property
is typically shorter (most commonly three to five years).

2 .Of all the “adjectival” requirements for adverse
possession—actual, exclusive, open and notorious, continuous, and adverse under
a claim of

right—which ones are at issue in _Scott v. Anderson-Tully
Co._? Courts often offer variations on the list of adjectival factors, and the
list the court provides

here is a little unconventional in adding a requirement that
the possession be “peaceable” to the list. Does this add anything over and
above the other

factors? Whatever the exact list of factors one chooses, it
can safely be said that the courts seek to assure themselves that the adverse
possessor is acting

as an owner would.

3 .The “open and notorious” requirement of adverse
possession (along with the actual, continuous, and exclusive elements) is
generally thought to

provide notice to the true owner that someone else is
claiming the property. The testimony in the principal case establishes that the
much-discussed

fence was erected by the Scotts, not by the Anderson-Tully
Company. Should a party like Anderson-Tully be able to claim that it has
provided notice to

the true owner by painting a blue mark—presumably on “its”
side—along

```



165



```

the fence erected by the true owners some years earlier for
the purpose of containing grazing cattle? Is there any testimony that the
Scotts were aware of

the blue mark or knew of its significance?

4 .Should cutting timber during three years (out of the
statutory 10 ) and allowing various parties to hunt on the land qualify as
“actual” possession?

A recent Kentucky case, _Moore v. Stills,_ 307 S.W. 2 d 71 (
2010 ), concludes that recreational activities like hunting, fishing, and
driving over the land in

all-terrain vehicles do not qualify as “actual possession.”
The court was fortified in this conclusion by a recent Kentucky statute,
similar to statutes

passed in many other states, that provides “[n]o action for
the recovery of real property... by adverse possession[ ] may be brought by any
person

whose claim is based on use solely for recreational
purposes.” Id. at 80 , quoting KRS 411. 190 ( 8 ). These statutes are designed
to reduce fears of property

owners that they may lose their property by tolerating
hunters and other recreational users on their land. Is the Mississippi court
here bucking the tide by

relying on recreational uses to establish “actual use” by
the Anderson-Tully Company?

5 .Boundary disputes are a mainstay of adverse possession
litigation. In some states, an alternative doctrine, usually called agreed
boundaries, is

available to resolve such disputes. As stated by a
California decision:

```



[T]he bases for this doctrine are that when there is
uncertainty as to the true boundary between coterminous owners, such owners
may,



expressly or by implication, fix a boundary line by a fence
or otherwise. Acceptance or acquiescence in the line so fixed for a period
equal to



that prescribed in the applicable statute of limitation...
establishes the agreed boundary as the actual boundary. The object of this rule
is to



secure repose, to prevent strife and disputes concerning
boundaries and make titles permanent and stable.



```

Finley v. Yuba County Water District, 99 Cal. App. 3 d 691 ,
699 ( 1979 ). Agreed boundaries rests on a state of mind roughly the opposite
of adverse

possession. Adverse possession requires that the AP has
proceeded without the permission of the TO. Agreed boundaries applies when the
AP has acted

with the permission—at least tacitly—of the TO. One would
think that the doctrines are mutually exclusive, but there are any number of
cases where

APs have invoked both in the alternative. Which doctrine
should be preferred as a basis for resolving boundary disputes? How would the
principal case

be decided under agreed boundaries?

6 .Surveying mistakes can lead to claims of adverse
possession, as we will see in _Howard v. Kunto_ , infra. Adverse possession
often steps in where

other systems of establishing ownership are treated as
inadequate. Notice that in _Scott_ , the area in question was in the U.S.
Rectangular Survey, but

because of difficult terrain had in effect reverted to metes
and bounds (description in terms of lengths, directions, and monuments, see
Chapter VIII).

Moreover, the company’s deed referred to the parcel by name,
without even attempting a metes and bounds description. Should this make
adverse

possession harder or easier to claim? For a dramatic example
of conflict

```



166



```

between land records and adverse possession, see Mugaas v.
Smith, excerpted in Chapter VIII.

7 .The court here requires that the AP evince a “claim of
ownership.” Other states require either a “claim of right” or, sometimes,
“color of title.”

“Claim of right” means, roughly, an intent to possess
something as one’s own. “Color of title” exists when a person has some
document—usually a deed,

will, or judicial decree—that purports to convey title but
does not in fact do so because of some legal defect (e.g., the grantor did not
own the land, or

the instrument was improperly executed). A few states
require “color of title” as an element of adverse possession, but most do not.
Still, an adverse

possessor with color of title has certain legal advantages.
In some states the statute of limitations, which sets the requisite period of
adverse possession,

is shorter for possessors with color of title. In nearly all
states, either by statute or under well-established doctrine, one who actually
possesses part of a

parcel of land under an instrument giving color of title to
the whole parcel is deemed to “constructively possess” the whole. So _actual_
adverse

possession of part of the parcel described in a defective
deed may give rise to _constructive_ adverse possession of the whole parcel.

Purposes of Adverse Possession

Why do we permit longstanding adverse possession of property
to ripen into a new title good against all the world, including the former

owner? The general reasons for having a statute of
limitations do not answer this question. There are, to be sure, justifications
for having statutes

of limitations. As time passes, witnesses die, memories
fade, and evidence gets lost or destroyed. The costs of proving or disproving
claims

invariably increase over time. When these costs get too
large, it is unfair to subject defendants to the risk of having to disprove
them, and unduly

burdensome to force courts to sort them out. But these costs
could be avoided simply by interpreting the statute of limitations for actions
to

recover property to mean that the plaintiff cannot rely on
events that happened before the period prescribed by the statute. Suppose the
statute of

limitations is ten years and the defendant constructed a
building on plaintiff’s land fifteen years ago. We could interpret the statute
to mean that

the plaintiff cannot allege or prove events occurring more
than ten years ago, such as the original construction of the building. But this
would not

bar the plaintiff from proving that the building now sits on
his land, that it is presently depriving him of possession, and that it should
be torn

down so as to permit him to recover possession. Such an
interpretation would avoid any danger of having to rely on lost evidence or to
call

witnesses whose memories have faded. In order to justify the
doctrine of adverse possession—which treats the passage of the statute not just
as a

rule that cuts off old claims but as an event that in effect
transfers ownership to the adverse possessor—we need some other reason or
rationale.

Perhaps the most commonly cited rationale is couched in
terms of the reliance interests that the possessor may have developed through

#167

longstanding possession of the property. Holmes expressed
the idea in typically colorful fashion: “[M]an, like a tree in the cleft of a
rock,

gradually shapes his roots to his surroundings, and when the
roots have grown up to a certain size, can’t be displaced without cutting at
his life.”

Letter from Oliver Wendell Holmes to William James (Apr. 1,
1907), in The Mind and Faith of Justice Holmes: His Speeches, Essays, Letters

and Judicial Opinions 417, 417–18 (Max Lerner ed., 1943).
Modern commentators have recast the argument in terms of loss aversion or the

endowment effect. Psychological studies show that people
tend to experience losses more acutely than foregone gains. In other words,
losing

something one already has is relatively more painful than
not getting something one does not yet have. If the AP is the person who “has”
the

property—which makes sense given that the AP is the one in
possession—then taking it from the AP may be more demoralizing to the AP than

denying it to the TO would be demoralizing to the TO. See
Jeffrey Evans Stake, The Uneasy Case for Adverse Possession, 89 Geo. L.J. 2419,

2459–71 (2001). An alternative way to make the point is that
the AP may have more of her “personhood” wrapped up in the property than the

TO. For the AP, the dispute involves some “thing” which the
AP possesses; for the TO, what is at issue is more in the nature of a fungible
asset

interchangeable with other assets. See Margaret Jane Radin,
Time, Possession, and Alienation, 64 Wash. U. L.Q. 739, 748 n.26 (1986).

Another longstanding rationale claims that adverse
possession is a penalty designed to discourage TOs from “sleeping on their
rights.” This

has been criticized as privileging active exploitation of
land and resources and discouraging passive, preservationist uses. See John C.

Sprankling, An Environmental Critique of Adverse Possession,
79 Cornell L. Rev. 816 (1994). But if we recast the point in terms of the

gatekeeper idea perhaps it avoids this criticism. Private
property can be seen as a system that delegates managerial authority over
resources to

private individuals who act as gatekeepers. If the
gatekeeper falls down on the job, the resource may not be protected against
abuse. Indeed, if the

resource is a forest or a wetland, a sleeping gatekeeper may
result in the resource being looted as an open access commons. Adverse
possession

can be seen from this perspective as a device for firing
gatekeepers guilty of nonfeasance and replacing them with persons who have
shown a

greater aptitude and eagerness to play the gatekeeper role.

A third rationale is that adverse possession reduces the
transaction costs of determining title to assets that last for a long time
(like land).

Over time, various potential claims to assets can
accumulate: Perhaps the property was mortgaged at various times and it is
unclear whether

those security interests were released; perhaps a married
couple owned the property and it is unclear whether both spouses released their
claims;

perhaps taxes due on the property were not paid in a given
year. If all these claims had to be investigated, no matter how old they might
be, the

costs of establishing clear title to durable assets would be
very large—

#168

large enough that they could impair the effective
functioning of markets for durable assets. By systematically eliminating these
old claims, like a

broom that sweeps away old cobwebs, adverse possession
reduces the costs of engaging in these transactions, and hence enhances the
efficiency

of property markets. Sometimes it is said that marketable
title acts are equally or more effective in eliminating these old claims. See
Stake, supra,

at 2 443–44. These statutes apply a conclusive presumption
that claims not (re)recorded within a certain period of time (e.g., 40 years)
can be

disregarded in establishing title to property. But
marketable title acts can be regarded as a version of adverse possession law—a
version with a

longer statute of limitations and fewer additional elements.
So the existence of these statutes only confirms the need for some mechanism
like

adverse possession to clear away old claims to property.
(For more on marketable title acts and land records generally, see Chapter
VIII.)

Adverse Possession Against the Government

At common law one could not obtain title by adverse
possession against the crown. This was pursuant to the maxim, nullum tempus
occurrit

regi (“no time runs against the king”). As Blackstone
explained, the law presumes “the king is always busied for the public good, and
therefore

has not leisure to assert his right within the times limited
to subjects.” 1 Blackstone, Commentaries *240. This assumption carried over to
the

United States, with the people’s elected representatives now
enjoying the presumption formerly accorded the king. See, e.g., United States
v.

Thompson, 98 U.S. 486 (1878); United States v. Hoar, 26 F.
Cas. 329 (C.C. Mass. 1821) (Story, J.). The courts concluded that “[i]n a

representative government, where the people do not and
cannot act in a body, where their power is delegated to others, and must of
necessity be

exercised by them, if exercised at all, the reason for
applying these principles is equally cogent.” Thompson, 98 U.S. at 489.

The presumption that adverse possession does not apply to
the government took on special significance during the settlement of the United

States, given the widespread practice of squatting on the
federal public lands, described earlier in this Chapter. Since the courts would
not permit

adverse possession as a matter of common law, this meant
that Congress could determine, in its discretion, the terms and conditions for

permitting squatters to obtain title to public land.
Congress, through the preemption acts, generally treated the squatters more
generously than

they would have been treated under the law of adverse
possession—but this judgment was for Congress to make. The common-law rule
takes on

special importance today, given the federal government’s
retention of millions of acres of National Parks, National Forests, Wilderness
Areas,

and other uninhabited lands. If adverse possession could be
claimed against the federal government, these lands could be at risk, given the
very

high monitoring costs that would be involved. See Round
Table Discussion, Time, Property Rights, and the Common Law, 64 Wash. U.

#169

L.Q. 793, 832–33 (1986) (comments of Robert Ellickson). The
presumption that adverse possession does not apply against the government has

been retained in some states, modified in others with longer
statutes of limitations against the government than against private owners, and
has

been abolished in still others. See William C. Marra,
Adverse Possession, Takings, and the State, 89 U. Det. Mercy L. Rev. 1 (2011).

#### Carpenter v. Ruperto

```



Supreme Court of Iowa, 1982.



315 N.W. 2 d 782.



```

■
MCCORMICK, JUSTICE. Plaintiff Virginia Carpenter appeals from an adverse decree
in her action to quiet title to land adjacent to her residential

premises based on a theory of adverse possession. * * * We
affirm[.] * * *

Plaintiff and her husband moved in 1951 to a home which they
purchased in southeast Des Moines. Plaintiff’s husband subsequently died,

but plaintiff has lived on the premises continuously. Her
lot has a frontage of 40 feet and is 125 feet long. * * *

A larger undeveloped lot bounded plaintiff’s property to the
north. * * *

Defendants and their predecessors have held record title to
this lot at all material times.

The property which plaintiff claims to have acquired by
adverse possession is the south 60 feet of defendants’ lot. Thus, the property
in

dispute is a 60 by 125 foot parcel adjacent to the north
boundary of plaintiff’s lot.

When plaintiff and her husband moved into their home in July
1951, the lot north of their property was a cornfield. Although plaintiff was

not certain of the location of the northern boundary of her
lot, she knew her lot’s dimensions, and she knew it did not include the
cornfield. In

1952 the corn was not planted as far south on the adjacent
lot. Concerned about rats and the threat of fire, and desiring additional yard
for their

children, plaintiff and her husband cleared several feet of
the property to the north, graded it, and planted grass seed on it. Since that
time

plaintiff has used the land as an extension of her yard. She
planted peony bushes on it during the 1950’s, installed a propane tank on it

approximately 30 feet north of her lot in 1964, constructed
a dirt bank on the city right of way to divert water from that parcel in 1965,
and put in

a driveway infringing five feet onto the land in 1975.

The remainder of defendants’ lot was planted in corn until
approximately 1957. The lot was owned by Abraham and Beverly Rosenfeld

from July 1960 until February 1978. During that period the
only use Rosenfelds made of the property was to store junk and debris on

#170

it. Except for the strip used by plaintiff, the lot was
overgrown with brush and weeds. The Rosenfelds paid all taxes and special
assessments on

the property. Plaintiff and her husband at one time obtained
the Rosenfelds’ permission to keep a horse on the lot. On one occasion in the
1960’s

plaintiff examined the plat of defendants’ lot in the
courthouse to see if it ran all the way to a street to the north.

When defendant McCormick purchased his interest in the lot
in 1978, he was aware of the possibility of a boundary dispute because of the

location of plaintiff’s propane tank and driveway. He and
the other defendants were unsuccessful in their efforts to settle the dispute
with

plaintiff, who subsequently brought this action.

In seeking to establish her ownership of the disputed
parcel, plaintiff alleged she had “for more than thirty (30) years last past
been in open,

exclusive, hostile, adverse and actual possession under
claim of right.” The trial court held in part that she did not establish her
possession was

under a claim of right. The court reasoned that a claim of
right must be made in good faith and that plaintiff was not in good faith
because she

knew someone else had title to the land. Although the court
found plaintiff had not proved her claim of adverse possession, it ordered
defendants

to “do equity” by deeding to her the strip of land her
driveway was on and to pay the costs of moving the propane tank to her lot. * *
*

The doctrine of adverse possession is based on the ten-year
statute of limitations for recovery of real property in section 614.1(5), The

Code. One claiming title by adverse possession must
establish hostile, actual, open, exclusive and continuous possession, under a
claim of right

or color of title, for at least ten years, by clear and
positive proof. Because the law presumes possession under regular title, the
doctrine is strictly

construed. These and other governing principles are
explained in I–80 Associates, Inc. v. Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific
Railroad, 224 N.W.2d

8, 10–11 (Iowa 1974).

As permitted, plaintiff relied on claim of right rather than
color of title. In contending the trial court erred in finding she failed in
her proof

of this element, she attacks the viability of the principal
case relied on by the trial court, Goulding v. Shonquist, 141 N.W. 24 (Iowa
1913). Its

facts are analogous to those here.

In Goulding the individual also cleared land adjacent to his
house. The land was overrun with brush and willows and was frequented by

hunters. After clearing it, the individual used the land as
a pasture and garden. In finding he did not establish good faith claim of
right, the court

said:

When he moved into his present property, the lands in
question were objectionable because they were frequented by hunters, and for

that reason he and his wife thought they ought to clear them
up. He says he supposed they were part of the old river bed or waste land

upon which anyone could enter. No other facts

#171

are offered by defendant as a reason for entering into the
possession of the land at that time. Whether the title to the land was in the

state or some other person, the defendant knew that he had
no title and that he had no claim of title, and no right whatever to enter into

the possession, and his possession was not in good faith for
that reason.

141 N.W. at 25. The court quoted a statement from Litchfield
v. Sewell, 66 N.W. 104, 106 (Iowa 1896), * * * “that there can be no such thing
as

adverse possession where the party knows he has no title,
and that, under the law, he can acquire none by his occupation.”

Plaintiff argues that it is inconsistent to say ownership
can be acquired by claim of right as an alternative to color of title and at
the same

time say ownership cannot be acquired by a person who knows
he does not have title. She also argues that the good faith requirement was

eliminated by the court decision in I–80 Associates, Inc.
Although we agree it is an overstatement to say ownership cannot be acquired by
a

person who knows he does not have title, plaintiff is
incorrect in her argument that good faith is not an essential component of
claim of right.

Moreover, we agree with the trial court that plaintiff did
not prove this element of her adverse possession claim.

The overbreadth of the statement that title cannot be
obtained through adverse possession by one who knows he has no title is
demonstrated

in Litchfield , Goulding and subsequent decisions. In
Litchfield the court rejected the adverse possession claim of a person in
possession of land

under a quitclaim deed from a squatter. In finding an
absence of good faith, the court noted the adverse possession doctrine “has no
application to

one who actually knows that he has no claim, or title, or
right to a title.” 66 N.W. at 106. Under this holding a mere squatter or one
who claims

under a squatter cannot have a good faith claim of right to
the property, but mere knowledge by the person that he has no title is not
preclusive. A

claim of right by a squatter is a false claim. To permit a
squatter to assert a claim of right would put a premium on dishonesty. See 4 H.
Tiffany,

Real Property § 1147 at 792 (3d ed. 1975). One of the main
purposes of the claim of right requirement is “to bar mere squatters from the
benefits

of adverse possession.” 7 R. Powell, Real Property ¶ 1015
(Rohan ed. 1981).

As in Litchfield , the possessor in Goulding not only knew
that he had no title but that he had no claim of title or any right to enter
into

possession of the property. He was a mere squatter.

Knowledge of a defect in title is not alone sufficient to
preclude proof of good faith:

One is not deprived of the benefit of the statute of
limitations merely because his claim of right is unenforceable or his title is
known to

be defective. The doctrine of adverse possession presupposes
a defective title. It is not based on, but is hostile to,

#172

the true title. If the statute were to run only in favor of
a valid title, it would serve no purpose. The holder of such a title has no
need to

invoke the statute. Where bad faith is held to negative an
alleged claim of right, it is only another way of saying that such claim has

been disproved.

Creel v. Hammans, 13 N.W.2d 305, 307 (Iowa 1944).

Nevertheless, when knowledge of lack of title is accompanied
by knowledge of no basis for claiming an interest in the property, a good faith

claim of right cannot be established. * * *

We believe plaintiff failed to prove a good faith claim of
right in the present case. She knew her lot did not include the cornfield north
of it.

She knew someone else had title to it and she had no
interest in it or claim to it. This is not a case of confusion or mistake. At
the time she

entered possession of the disputed land, plaintiff knew she
had no legal right to do so. To say that one can acquire a claim of right by
merely

entering possession would recognize squatter’s rights.
Possession for the statutory period cannot be bootstrapped into a basis for
claiming a right

to possession.

We hold that the trial court was right in rejecting
plaintiff’s claim. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Probably the most contentious issue in the law of adverse
possession is what it means to say that the AP’s possession must be adverse
under a

claim of right. (Sometimes courts say “hostile under a claim
of right” or just “adverse” or “hostile,” and in _Scott_ , supra, the court
couches it as a “claim

of ownership.”) Commentators generally distinguish three
positions: ( 1 ) Adverse under a claim of _right_ means that the AP
subjectively (but mistakenly)

believes he is legally entitled to possession of the
property, i.e., the AP is acting in good faith. ( 2 ) Adverse under a claim of
right means that the AP

subjectively believes he is not legally entitled to
possession of the property, i.e., the AP is acting in bad faith. ( 3 ) The AP’s
subjective state of mind is

irrelevant; all that matters is that the AP has not been
given permission by the TO to use the property. The rule (our ( 2 )) requiring
bad faith has been

called the “Maine Rule,” after the convoluted decision in
_Preble v. Maine Cent. R. Co._ , 27 A. 149 (Me. 1893 ). It has always been at
best the minority

rule; indeed, legislation in Maine now precludes it. See
Maine Rev. Stat. § 810 – A. Most commentators favor the so-called Connecticut
Rule (our ( 3 )),

which makes state of mind irrelevant. But disagreement
abounds as to whether good faith should be required or all that is required is
lack of permission.

That adverse possession comes up in squatting, color of
title, and boundary mistake cases, has led courts to equivocate and confuse the
issue. See, e.g.,

Lee Anne Fennell, Efficient Trespass: The Case for Bad Faith
Adverse Possession, 100 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1037 ( 2006 ); Jeffrey Evans Stake, The
Uneasy

Case for Adverse Possession, 89 Geo. L.J. 2419 ( 2001 );
Luke Meier, The Neglected History Behind _Preble v. Maine Central Railroad
Company_ :

Lessons from the “Maine Rule” for Adverse Possession, 44
Hofstra L. Rev. 537 ( 2016 ).

2. _Carpenter_ is probably in the minority in explicitly
   requiring good faith as a condition of obtaining title by adverse possession.
   The English cases

and most American legal commentators favor the objective
non-permission interpretation of adverse under a claim of right. This position
is logical if we

think of adverse possession as being grounded in the
application of the statute of limitations to a legal action in trespass,
ejectment, conversion, or

replevin to recover possession of property. None of these
actions requires subjective good faith or bad faith on the part of the
possessor—lack of

permission from the TO is enough—so it stands to reason that
the statute of limitations on these actions will run without regard to the
subjective state of

mind of the adverse possessor. In an important survey of the
American appellate case law, however, Professor Helmholz concluded that courts
generally

grant adverse possession only to possessors who act in good
faith. See Richard Helmholz, Adverse Possession and Subjective Intent, 61 Wash.
U. L.Q.

65 ( 1983 ). His claim is controversial, and elicited a
vigorous rejoinder. See Roger Cunningham, Adverse Possession and Subjective
Intent: A Reply to

Professor Helmholz, 64 Wash. U. L.Q. 1 ( 1986 ); Richard
Helmholz, More on Subjective Intent: A Response to Professor Cunningham, 64
Wash. U.

L.Q. 65 ( 1986 ). Helmholz does not contend that most courts
actually require good faith; his claim is that, as he reads the recitation of
the facts in

reported appellate opinions, when courts award title by
adverse

```



174



```

possession, the AP almost invariably is portrayed in the
opinion as having acted in good faith.

3 .Recent developments in adverse possession law have
focused on the role of bad faith. In a notorious (in the nonlegal sense) case
in Colorado, a

former judge successfully invoked adverse possession in bad
faith to acquire one third of his neighbor’s land, McLean v. DK Trust, No. 06
CV 982 , slip

op. at 1 (Dist. Ct. Colo. Oct. 17 , 2007 ). Public protests
and death threats ensued, resulting in a successful campaign to amend Colorado
law to render bad

faith disqualifying in adverse possession cases. Colo. Rev.
Stat. § 38 – 41 – 101 ( 3 )(b)(II). Interestingly, the Colorado statute now
gives courts discretion to

order compensation to the party losing title in an adverse
possession case. Id. § 38 – 41 – 108 – ( 5 )(a). (For more on compensation in
the context of

prescriptive easements, see Chapter IX.) Recently, in
response to cases that had resulted in the Court of Appeals dropping a good
faith requirement for

adverse possession, the New York Assembly amended its
adverse possession statute to require that adverse possession be asserted under
a “claim of

right,” which in turn requires that an adverse possessor
have a reasonable basis to believe she is the true owner. N.Y. Real Prop. Acts.
& Proc. Law

§ 501 ( 3 ).

4 .Do these developments suggest that the Iowa Supreme
Court’s position that squatters cannot obtain title to land by adverse
possession is the

wave of the future? Or does some recent commentary
celebrating some instances of squatting suggest the opposite? Eduardo Moisés
Peñalver & Sonia

K. Katyal, Property Outlaws: How Squatters, Pirates, and
Protesters Improve the Law of Ownership ( 2010 ); see also Elizabeth M. Glazer,
Rule of

(Out)law: Property’s Contingent Right to Exclude, 156 U. Pa.
L. Rev. PENNumbra 331 , 342 – 43 ( 2008 ). Or do the recent controversies
suggest that

limiting adverse possession to good faith possessors accords
with widespread moral intuitions, thereby making property norms more secure and
easier to

communicate? See Thomas W. Merrill & Henry E. Smith, The
Morality of Property, 48 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 1849 ( 2007 ).

5 .Is there a limit to how far back we are willing to go to
rectify the acquisition of property in bad faith? Should there be a two-tiered
statute of

limitations (and doctrine of adverse possession)—a
relatively short period (say 10 years) for good faith misappropriations, and a
much longer period

(say 50 years or even 100 years) for bad faith
misappropriations? See Richard A. Epstein, Past and Future: The Temporal
Dimension in the Law of

Property, 64 Wash. U. L.Q. 667 , 685 – 89 ( 1986 ). Some
countries do have a longer statute of limitations for what amounts to adverse
possession in bad

faith, and some states have a longer statute of limitations
for claims not based on color of title.

6 .Pressure has built to relax adverse possession law in the
face of mass injustice. Many courts are reluctant to dismiss on grounds of
adverse

possession claims by descendants of victims of Nazi
persecution seeking to recover artwork and other valuable assets looted by the
Nazis many decades

before. The Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2016
(codified at 22 U.S.C. § 1621 ) overrides state statuses of limitations for
“artwork or other

property that was lost during the covered period” of January
1 , 1933 to

```



175



```

December 31 , 1945 “because of Nazi persecution” and
subjects such claims to a national six-year statute of limitations; the new
statute of limitations

expires on January 1 , 2027 at which time the state statutes
will again govern. See Fallon S. Sheridan, The Sunset of the Holocaust
Expropriated Art

Recovery Act of 2016 and the Rise of the Demand and Refusal
Rule, 89 Fordham L. Rev. 2841 ( 2021 ). A provision precluding the defense of
laches

was eliminated from an early version of the bill. Would any
application of the doctrine of laches undermine the purpose of the act? See
Scott M.

Caravello, The Role of the Doctrine of Laches in Undermining
the Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1769 ( 2020 ).

Court of Appeals of Washington, 1970.



477 P. 2 d 210.



```

■
PEARSON, JUDGE. Land surveying is an ancient art but not one free of the errors
that often creep into the affairs of men. In this case, we are

presented with the question of what happens when the
descriptions in deeds do not fit the land the deed holders are occupying.
Defendants appeal

from a decree quieting title in the plaintiffs of a tract of
land on the shore of Hood Canal in Mason County.

At least as long ago as 1932 the record tells us that one
McCall resided in the house now occupied by the appellant-defendants, Kunto.

McCall had a deed that described a 50-foot-wide parcel on
the shore of Hood Canal. The error that brings this case before us is that the
50 feet

described in the deed is not the same 50 feet upon which
McCall’s house stood. Rather, the described land is an adjacent 50-foot lot
directly west

of that upon which the house stood. In other words, McCall’s
house stood on one lot and his deed described the adjacent lot. Several
property

owners to the west of defendants, not parties to this
action, are similarly situated.

Over the years since 1946, several conveyances occurred,
using the same legal description and accompanied by a transfer of possession to

the succeeding occupants. The Kuntos’ immediate predecessors
in interest, Millers, desired to build a dock. To this end, they had a survey

performed which indicated that the deed description and the
physical occupation were in conformity. Several boundary stakes were placed as
a

result of this survey and the dock was constructed, as well
as other improvements. The house as well as the others in the area continued to
be

used as summer recreational retreats.

The Kuntos then took possession of the disputed property
under a deed from the Millers in 1959. In 1960 the respondent-plaintiffs,
Howard,

who held land east of that of the Kuntos, determined to
convey an undivided one-half interest in their land to the Yearlys. To this
end, they

undertook to have a survey of the entire area made. After
expending considerable effort, the surveyor retained by the Howards discovered
that

according to the government survey, the deed descriptions
and the land

#176

occupancy of the parties did not coincide. Between the
Howards and the Kuntos lay the Moyers’ property. When the Howards’ survey was

completed, they discovered that they were the record owners
of the land occupied by the Moyers and that the Moyers held record title to the
land

occupied by the Kuntos. Howard approached Moyer and in
return for a conveyance of the land upon which the Moyers’ house stood, Moyer

conveyed to the Howards record title to the land upon which
the Kunto house stood. Until plaintiffs Howard obtained the conveyance from

Moyer in April, 1960, neither Moyer nor any of his
predecessors ever asserted any right to ownership of the property actually
being possessed by

Kunto and his predecessors. This action was then instituted
to quiet title in the Howards and Yearlys. The Kuntos appeal from a trial court

decision granting this remedy.

At the time this action was commenced on August 19, 1960,
defendants had been in occupance of the disputed property less than a year.

The trial court’s reason for denying their claim of adverse
possession is succinctly stated in its memorandum opinion: “In this instance,

defendants have failed to prove, by a preponderance of the
evidence, a continuity of possession or estate to permit tacking of the adverse

possession of defendants to the possession of their
predecessors.”

Finding of fact 6,^4 which is challenged by defendants,
incorporates the above concept and additionally finds defendant’s possession
not to

have been “continuous” because it involved only “summer
occupancy.”

#177

Figure 2-7

Two issues are presented by this appeal:

(1)Is a claim of adverse possession defeated because the
physical use of the premises is restricted to summer occupancy?

(2)May a person who receives record title to tract A under
the mistaken belief that he has title to tract B (immediately

contiguous to tract A) and who subsequently occupies tract
B, for the purpose of establishing title to tract B by adverse

possession, use the periods of possession of tract B by his
immediate predecessors who also had record title to tract A?

In approaching both of these questions, we point out that
the evidence, largely undisputed in any material sense, established that
defendant

or his immediate predecessors did occupy the premises, which

#178

we have called tract B, as though it was their own for far
more than the 10 years as prescribed in RCW 4.16.020.^5

We also point out that finding of fact 6 is not challenged
for its factual determinations but for the conclusions contained therein to the
effect

that the continuity of possession may not be established by
summer occupancy, and that a predecessor’s possession may not be tacked because
a

legal “claim of right” did not exist under the
circumstances.

We start with the oft-quoted rule that: “To constitute
adverse possession, there must be actual possession which is uninterrupted ,
open and

notorious, hostile and exclusive, and under a claim of right
made in good faith for the statutory period.” Butler v. Anderson, 426 P.2d 467,
470

(Wash. 1967) (emphasis added).

We reject the conclusion that summer occupancy only of a
summer beach home destroys the continuity of possession required by the

statute. It has become firmly established that the requisite
possession requires such possession and dominion “as ordinarily marks the
conduct of

owners in general in holding, managing, and caring for
property of like nature and condition.” Whalen v. Smith, 167 N.W. 646, 647
(Iowa 1918).

We hold that occupancy of tract B during the summer months
for more than the 10-year period by defendant and his predecessors, together

with the continued existence of the improvements on the land
and beach area, constituted “uninterrupted” possession within this rule. To
hold

otherwise is to completely ignore the nature and condition
of the property.

We find such rule fully consonant with the legal writers on
the subject. In F. Clark, Law of Surveying and Boundaries, § 561 (3d ed. 1959)

at 565: “Continuity of possession may be established
although the land is used regularly for only a certain period each year.”
Further, at 566:

This rule * * * is one of substance and not of absolute
mathematical continuity, provided there is no break so as to sever two

possessions. It is not necessary that the occupant should be
actually upon the premises continually. If the land is occupied during the

period of time during the year it is capable of use, there
is sufficient continuity.

We now reach the question of tacking. The precise issue
before us is novel in that none of the property occupied by defendant or his

#179

predecessors coincided with the property described in their
deeds, but was contiguous.

In the typical case, which has been subject to much
litigation, the party seeking to establish title by adverse possession claims
more land

than that described in the deed. In such cases it is clear
that tacking is permitted.

In Buchanan v. Cassell, 335 P.2d 600, 602 (Wash. 1959) the
Supreme Court stated: “This state follows the rule that a purchaser may tack
the

adverse use of its predecessor in interest to that of his
own where the land was intended to be included in the deed between them, but
was

mistakenly omitted from the description.” El Cerrito, Inc.
v. Ryndak, 376 P.2d 528 (Wash. 1962).

The general statement which appears in many of the cases is
that tacking of adverse possession is permitted if the successive occupants are

in “privity.” See Faubion v. Elder, 301 P.2d 153 (Wash.
1956). The deed running between the parties purporting to transfer the land
possessed

traditionally furnishes the privity of estate which connects
the possession of the successive occupants. Plaintiff contends, and the trial
court ruled,

that where the deed does not describe any of the land which
was occupied, the actual transfer of possession is insufficient to establish
privity.

To assess the cogency of this argument and ruling, we must
turn to the historical reasons for requiring privity as a necessary
prerequisite to

tacking the possession of several occupants. Very few, if
any, of the reasons appear in the cases, nor do the cases analyze the
relationships that

must exist between successive possessors for tacking to be
allowed. See W. Stoebuck, The Law of Adverse Possession In Washington in 35

Wash.L.Rev. 53 (1960).

The requirement of privity had its roots in the notion that
a succession of trespasses, even though there was no appreciable interval
between

them, should not, in equity, be allowed to defeat the record
title. The “claim of right,” “color of title” requirement of the statutes and
cases was

probably derived from the early American belief that the
squatter should not be able to profit by his trespass.^6

However, it appears to this court that there is a
substantial difference between the squatter or trespasser and the property
purchaser, who

along with several of his neighbors, as a result of an
inaccurate survey or subdivision, occupies and improves property exactly 50
feet to the east

of that which a survey some 30 years later demonstrates that
they in fact own. It seems to us that there is also a strong public policy
favoring

early certainty as to the location of land ownership which
enters into a proper interpretation of privity.

On the irregular perimeters of Puget Sound exact
determination of land locations and boundaries is difficult and expensive. This
difficulty is

#180

convincingly demonstrated in this case by the problems
plaintiff’s engineer encountered in attempting to locate the corners. It cannot
be expected

that every purchaser will or should engage a surveyor to
ascertain that the beach home he is purchasing lies within the boundaries
described in

his deed. Such a practice is neither reasonable nor
customary. Of course, 50-foot errors in descriptions are [devastating] where a
group of

adjacent owners each hold 50 feet of waterfront property.

The technical requirement of “privity” should not, we think,
be used to upset the long periods of occupancy of those who in good faith

received an erroneous deed description. Their “claim of
right” is no less persuasive than the purchaser who believes he is purchasing
more land

than his deed described.

In the final analysis, however, we believe the requirement
of “privity” is no more than judicial recognition of the need for some
reasonable

connection between successive occupants of real property so
as to raise their claim of right above the status of the wrongdoer or the
trespasser.

We think such reasonable connection exists in this case.

Where, as here, several successive purchasers received
record title to tract A under the mistaken belief that they were acquiring
tract B,

immediately contiguous thereto, and where possession of
tract B is transferred and occupied in a continuous manner for more than 10
years by

successive occupants, we hold there is sufficient privity of
estate to permit tacking and thus establish adverse possession as a matter of
law.

We see no reason in law or in equity for differentiating
this case from Faubion v. Elder, 301 P.2d 153 (Wash. 1956) where the appellants

were claiming more land than their deed described and where
successive periods of occupation were allowed to be united to each other to
make

up the time of adverse holding. This application of the
privity requirement should particularly pertain where the holder of record
title to tract B

acquired the same with knowledge of the discrepancy.

Judgment is reversed with directions to dismiss plaintiffs’
action and to enter a decree quieting defendants’ title to the disputed tract
of land

in accordance with the prayer of their cross-complaint.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .A large number of adverse possession disputes seem to
involve seasonal or vacation properties. Why do you suppose this might be the
case?

2 .Which of the five standard doctrinal elements is at issue
in _Howard v. Kunto_? Why are the other issues ignored?

3 .What is the best characterization of the state of mind of
the Kuntos (adverse possessors): good faith, bad faith, or unclear? What state
of mind

does the State of Washington appear to require in order to
establish title by adverse possession?

```



181



```

4 .By limiting tacking to situations in which successive APs
are in “privity of estate,” the court permits tacking when A enters adversely,
and then

sells to B, who then sells to C. But tacking would not be
permitted where A enters adversely, and then B enters adversely (the very
instant A leaves), and

the then C enters adversely (the very instant B leaves). Why
should these two situations be treated differently?

5 .Note that issues about tacking can arise on both the AP
side of the dispute (as discussed in _Howard v. Kunto_ ) or on the TO side of
the dispute. In

fact, isn’t there a tacking issue on both the AP side and
the TO side in _Howard v. Kunto_? The Howards only just recently acquired from
the Moyers the

deed describing the land on which the Kuntos’ house sits. In
theory, therefore, the Kuntos must show that the transfer of the deed from the
Moyers to the

Howards did not start the statute of limitations running
anew. Should privity of estate also be required before an AP can tack the
current TO’s period of

ownership onto that of a prior owner in order to show that
the period of the statute of limitations has elapsed?

6 .Another wrinkle in the adverse possession timeline is the
doctrine of “relation back.” Once the AP has satisfied the requirements for
acquisition

of title by adverse possession, the AP is (now) deemed to
have been the owner from the time that the AP first entered into (adverse)
possession. Of

course, during that time, if the TO had sued the AP in
trespass or ejectment or in a quiet title action, the TO would (absent error)
be declared the owner.

Why might relation back matter? Incidentally, as of what
date is the adverse possession complete in this case?

NOTE ON DISABILITIES

Another issue that occasionally arises in determining
whether the statute of limitations has run involves whether the TO’s
circumstances should

excuse her from bringing suit or whether they should either
slow down or stop the clock running on bringing suit. Typically, state statutes
provide that

the statute of limitations is tolled for owners suffering
from certain narrow classes of disabilities, including being under age, insane,
legally incompetent,

or (sometimes) in prison, _at the time the AP entered_.
Disabilities arising later usually do not affect the running of the statute,
and disabilities in the same

or successive owners cannot be tacked. Also, other hardships
that might hinder the TO from bringing suit, such as poverty, do not affect the
running of

the statute.

The mechanisms for altering the statutory period vary. Under
one common approach, a shorter period of time, say 10 years as opposed to 20
years,

is provided as a minimum after the removal of the
disability. See, e.g., N.D. Cen. Code §§ 28 – 01 – 08 & – 14 (providing for
special 10 - year statute of

limitations after removal of disability instead of otherwise
applicable 20 - year periods in cases of disability); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §
2305. 04 (providing

for 10 years after removal of disability if the regular 21 -
year statute of limitations would already have run). In other states, the
disability tolls the statute.

See, e.g., Mont. Code § 70 – 19 – 413. Usually, a successor
of the

```



182



```

landowner under the disability benefits from the same
provision, but not all states allow for this.

Consider this example. The statutory period for adverse
possession is 20 years. When the AP enters, TO is insane. Twenty-five years
pass, and then

TO regains his sanity. On the first, “additional time,”
approach, the TO then has 10 years to bring an action to regain possession.
(What if the regular

statute of limitations is 20 years and the disability is
removed in Year 19 ?) On the second, “tolling,” approach, the TO would now have
20 years. If the

TO had been a minor at the time of entry by the AP and in
the meantime had become insane or gone to prison, the statutory clock would
have started

ticking again when TO attains the age of majority.

It is easy to see how the disability might make us skeptical
that the TO is being truly slothful. Do these rules about disabilities fit in
with any of the

other rationales for adverse possession? Why should only
disabilities existing at the time of the AP’s entry affect the length of the
statutory period for

adverse possession?

#### Songbyrd, Inc. v. Estate of Grossman

```



United States District Court, N.D. New York, 1998.



23 F. Supp. 2 d 219.



```

■ HOMER,
UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE. Plaintiff Songbyrd, Inc. (“Songbyrd”) brought
this action seeking monetary damages and a

declaration of rights in certain recorded music tracks.
Presently pending is a motion by defendant Estate of Albert B. Grossman, doing
business

as Bearsville Records, Inc. (“Bearsville”) for summary
judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 on the ground that the action is barred by
the

applicable statute of limitations. Songbyrd opposes the
motion. For the reasons which follow, the motion is granted.

I.Facts

This case concerns the possession, ownership, and usage of
several master recordings of musical performances made in the early 1970s by

New Orleans musician Henry Roeland Byrd, who was
professionally known as “Professor Longhair” (“Byrd”).^2 The tapes were
produced in a

Baton Rouge, Louisiana recording studio and soon thereafter
came into the possession of a predecessor in interest to Bearsville located in

Woodstock, New York. Over time several requests have been
made by representatives of Byrd to secure return of the tapes. It is unclear
what if

any response those requests received, but the tapes have
remained in the physical custody of Bearsville continuously since the 1970s.

In August 1986, Bearsville licensed certain of the master
recordings to Rounder Records Corporation, which in 1987 released an album of

Byrd’s music produced from the recordings. In 1991, another
recording based on the disputed master recordings was released by Rhino
Records.

#183

That release was made possible by a licensing agreement
between Bearsville and the production company.

II.Procedural Background

Originally filed in Louisiana state court in 1995, this
action was removed by Bearsville to the United States District Court for the
Eastern

District of Louisiana. Bearsville then moved pursuant to
Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) to dismiss the claim on the ground that the court lacked
personal

jurisdiction and the claim was barred by Louisiana’s period
of prescription.^3 The district court held that the action was barred by the
applicable

prescriptive period and granted the motion without
addressing the jurisdictional question. Songbyrd, Inc. v. Bearsville Records,
Inc., Civ.A. No.

95–3706, 1996 WL 337259 (E.D.La. June 18, 1996). Songbyrd
appealed and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the
claim

was not prescribed under Louisiana law. 104 F.3d 773, 779
(5th Cir. 1 997). On remand, the district court considered the question of
personal

jurisdiction, concluded that jurisdiction was lacking, and
transferred the action to this district. The present motion followed. * * *

IV.Discussion

A.Choice of Law

* * * Both parties agree that * * * disposition of this case
      is governed by New York law.

B.New York Statute of Limitations

This action is governed by the three year statute of
limitations for recovery of chattel provided in N.Y. Civ. Prac. L. & R. §
214(3)

(McKinney 1990); Johnson v. Smithsonian Inst., 9 F.Supp.2d
347, 354 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (New York statute of limitations for conversion and

replevin is three years). The issue presented here is when
the claim accrued for statute of limitations purposes.

The statute of limitations for conversion begins to run at
the time of the conversion. Sporn v. MCA Records, Inc., 448 N.E.2d 1324, 1327

(N.Y. 1983); see also Vigilant Ins. Co. of Am. v. Housing
Auth. of the City of El Paso, Tex., 660 N.E.2d 1 121, 1126 (N.Y. 1995). In
Sporn , New

York’s Court of Appeals was presented with a case very
similar to the case at bar. There, the plaintiff, the successor in interest to
the purported

owner of rights in certain master recordings, sued the
defendant record company for commercially exploiting the master recordings
contrary to

the plaintiff’s interests. Sporn, 448 N.E.2d at 1 325–26.
The record company defended on the ground that the three year limitations
period had

begun to run at the time it began using the master
recordings contrary to the plaintiff’s purported interest and had expired prior
to the

commencement of the action. Holding that the statute of
limitations for conversion begins to run at the time of the conversion, the
Court of

Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of
the record company.

Songbyrd contends that Solomon R. Guggenheim Found. v.
Lubell , 569 N.E.2d 426 (N.Y. 1991) (“ Guggenheim ”), not Sporn , governs this

action. In Guggenheim , the New York Court of Appeals held
that “a cause of action for replevin against a good-faith purchaser of a stolen
chattel

accrues when the true owner makes demand for return of the
chattel and the person in possession of the chattel refuses to return it.” Id.
at 429.

Songbyrd argues that under Guggenheim the statute of
limitations does not begin to run until after a demand for return has been
refused, that

such a demand has been made but not refused here and as a
result the limitations period has not yet begun to run. Guggenheim , however,

addresses the different circumstance of possession of a
chattel by a bona fide purchaser for value and does not, therefore, provide the
controlling

rule of law here.

Guggenheim , in fact, recognized that a different rule
applies when the stolen chattel remains in the possession of the thief. Citing
Sporn , the

court stated that in such a circumstance the statute of
limitations begins to run from the time of the theft. Guggenheim, 569 N.E.2d at
429. Here,

the chattel at issue has remained in the possession of
Bearsville,

#185

the party alleged to have committed the wrongful taking.
There is no evidence that Bearsville was ever a bona fide purchaser for value.
Thus, the

statute of limitations here began to run at the time
Bearsville converted the master recordings. See Vigilant Ins. Co., 660 N.E.2d
at 1126 (in a

case not involving a bona fide purchaser, a conversion claim
accrues at the time of the conversion). Thus, Guggenheim is limited to

circumstances involving a bona fide purchaser’s possession
of the chattel.

Having concluded that Songbyrd’s conversion claim accrued at
the time of the conversion, the question becomes when the master

recordings were allegedly converted. “The tort of conversion
is established when one who owns and has a right to possession of personal

property proves that the property is in the unauthorized
possession of another who has acted to exclude the rights of the owner.” Key
Bank of

N.Y. v. Grossi, 642 N.Y.S.2d 403, 405 (App. Div. 3d Dep’t
1996). A party acts to the exclusion of the rights of another by exercising
dominion

and control over the property that is inconsistent with the
interests of the true owner. Shaw v. Rolex Watch, U.S.A., Inc., 673 F.Supp.
674, 682

(S.D.N.Y. 1 987). Accepting this definition of conversion,
the decisive issue is when Bearsville began unauthorized possession of the
master

recordings.

Bearsville undeniably had lawful and authorized possession
of the master tapes when they were first transferred to its predecessor in
1972.

In August 1986, the master recordings were licensed by
Bearsville to Rounder Records. The result of this agreement was the 1987
release of an

album of Byrd’s music taken from the master recordings. This
licensing agreement clearly demonstrated Bearsville’s intent to exercise
control

over the Byrd recordings to the exclusion of Songbyrd. See
Jaywyn Video Productions, Ltd. v. Servicing All Media, Inc., 577 N.Y.S.2d 847,
848

(App. Div. 1st Dep’t 1992) (licensing of property rights
demonstrates exercise of dominion and control). Any claim for conversion,
therefore,

accrued no later than August 1986 and was time barred at the
time this action was filed in 1995.^4 That Songbyrd may not have known of the

conversion at the time it occurred is of no moment. Two
Clinton Square Corp. v. Friedler, 459 N.Y.S.2d 179 (App. Div. 4th Dep’t 1983);

Memorial Hosp. v. McGreevy, 574 N.Y.S.2d 923, 925 (Sup. Ct.
1991) (claim accrues at time of conversion “even though the plaintiff may have

been unaware of the occurrence.”).

Where, as here, “[t]he conduct of the defendant certainly
constituted a denial of both the plaintiff’s right to the master recording and
a total

usurping of plaintiff’s right to possess the master
recording,” the claim is properly stated as one for conversion. Sporn, 448
N.E.2d at 1327. That

claim is clearly untimely. The time bar arose in August
1989, three years following the licensing agreement with Rounder Records.^6
Conversion

is

#186

not a continuing wrong for which every new act that might
constitute conversion restarts a new limitations period. Tinker v. Abrams, 640
F.Supp.

229, 232 (S.D.N.Y. 198 6) (citing Sporn, 448 N.E.2d at
1326–27). Here, Songbyrd simply failed to commence this action within the
applicable

statute of limitations. Bearsville’s motion must, therefore,
be granted.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The Fifth Circuit’s decision holding that Songbyrd’s
claim was not subject to prescription under Louisiana law provides some
additional details

about Professor Longhair:

```



The late Henry Roeland Byrd, also known as “Professor
Longhair,” was an influential New Orleans rhythm-and-blues pianist and
composer,



and is widely regarded as one of the primary inspirations
for the renaissance of New Orleans popular music over the last thirty years.
His



numerous hits included original compositions such as
“Tipitina” and “Go to the Mardi Gras,” as well as his famous renditions of Earl
King’s



“Big Chief.” After achieving modest commercial success as a
local performer and recording artist in the 1940 ’s and 1950 ’s, Byrd fell on
hard



times during the 1960 ’s. His fortunes began to change for
the better in 1970 , however, when New Orleans music aficionado Arthur “Quint”



Davis, along with others, founded the New Orleans Jazz and
Heritage Festival (“JazzFest”). Needing talented performers for JazzFest, Davis



located Byrd in 1971 working in an obscure record store in
New Orleans and transformed him into a perennial star attraction of the
JazzFest



and other venues from that time until his death in 1980.



```

Songbyrd, Inc. v. Bearsville Records, Inc., 104 F. 3 d 773 ,
774 ( 5 th Cir. 1997 ). Albert Grossman, who died in 1986 , was one of the
founders of the

Newport Folk Festival and promoted the careers of a number
of musical stars, including Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, and Gordon Lightfoot.
Bearsville,

New York, where he lived and worked, is a small town near
Woodstock, New York. For more on the background of the case and a comparison of

common law adverse possession to Louisiana civilian
“acquisitive prescription,” see John A. Lovett, Professor Longhair’s Legacy:
Revendicating

Movables under Louisiana Law, in Northern Lights: Essays in
Honour of David Carey Miller 31 (Douglas Bain, Roderick Paisley, & Andrew
R.C.

Simpson eds., 2018 ).

2 .If one were simply to weigh the equitable claims of the
parties, one might expect that courts would give true owners more time to
recover

property taken by a person in bad faith, like a thief, and
less time to recover property taken by someone who has acted in good faith,
like a good faith

purchaser. Yet New York law regarding adverse possession of
personal property appears to do the opposite. Under the time-of-conversion rule
applied in

the principal case, the statute of limitations begins to run
as soon as the property is converted, resulting in a short period to seek
recovery.

```



187



```

Under the demand rule of _Guggenheim_ , the statute of
limitations does not begin to run until the true owner makes a demand for the
return of the

property from a good faith purchaser, and the demand is
refused. This typically results in a longer period to seek recovery, since the
demand and refusal

will virtually always occur after the conversion. As a
result, New York treats thieves more favorably than good faith purchasers. Is
there any justification

for this distinction that would explain what otherwise seems
quite counterintuitive?

3 .The New Jersey Supreme Court, in _O’Keeffe v. Snyder_ ,
416 A. 2 d 862 (N.J. 1980 ), adopted a third test for determining when the
statute of

limitations starts to run for purposes of adverse possession
of personal property: the discovery rule. Under this rule, “a cause of action
will not accrue

until the injured party discovers, or by exercise of
reasonable diligence and intelligence should have discovered, facts which form
the basis of a cause of

action.” Id. at 869. Generally speaking, the discovery rule
would give the TO an intermediate period of time to recover personal property,
somewhere in

between the conversion rule and the demand rule. The
conversion rule applied in _Songbyrd_ will generally result in the shortest
period because the statute

starts to run at the moment of conversion; the discovery
rule would provide more time, because it may take a while for a diligent TO to
learn about the

conversion or discover the whereabouts of the object; the
demand rule would provide the longest time, because there is no requirement
that the TO show

reasonable diligence before asserting the demand for return
of the property. What advantages and disadvantages do you see in adopting the
discovery

rule, as opposed to either the conversion rule or the demand
rule?

4 .What is the best characterization of the state of mind of
the defendant in _Songbyrd_ : good faith, bad faith, or unclear? What state of
mind does

the Court seem to require for establishing a claim of title
by adverse possession?

5 .One oddity of this case is that the parties are really
concerned with what is on the tapes—the song recordings—rather than with the
physical

tapes themselves. Copyright law distinguishes between
musical works (sheet music and lyrics) and sound recordings. See 17 U.S.C. §
101. Musical

works were brought into federal copyright in 1831 , but
sound recordings did not receive protection until 1972 and this protection is
somewhat different

from that for musical works. Can the copyright in a sound
recording be adversely possessed? If not, why not?

### G. COMPETING PRINCIPLES OF ORIGINAL TITLE

Now that we have seen six principles for establishing
original title (first possession, discovery, creation, prior possession,
accession, adverse

possession), we can also see that some of the more difficult
problems of original title in fact involve clashes between parties claiming
under

competing principles of original acquisition. Since the
principles proceed from different premises, it is difficult to say that there
is a “right

answer” in any of these cases. The cases selected here all
involve conflicts between

#188

first possession and accession, but in theory similar
conflicts could arise between any of the principles.

#### Briggs v. Southwestern Energy Production Company

```



Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, 2020.



224 A. 3 d 334.



```

■ CHIEF
JUSTICE SAYLOR. In this appeal by allowance, we consider whether the rule of
capture immunizes an energy developer from liability in

trespass, where the developer uses hydraulic fracturing on
the property it owns or leases, and such activities allow it to obtain oil or
gas that

migrates from beneath the surface of another person’s land.

I.Background

A.The rule of capture

Oil and gas are minerals, and while in place they are
considered part of the land. See Hamilton v. Foster , 116 A. 50, 52 (Pa. 1922).
They

differ from coal and other substances with a fixed situs in
that they are fugacious in nature—meaning they tend to seep or flow across
property

lines beneath the surface of the earth. Such underground
movement is known as “drainage.” Drainage stems from a physical property of
fluids in

that they naturally move across a pressure gradient from
high to low pressure. Indeed, the extraction of oil or gas by drilling is
based, at least in

part, on creating a low-pressure pathway from the mineral’s
subterranean location to the earth’s surface.

Oil and gas have thus been described as having a “fugitive
and wandering existence,” Brown v. Vandergrift, 80 Pa. 142, 147 (Pa. 1875), and

have been compared to wild animals which move about from one
property to another. See Westmoreland & Cambria Nat. Gas Co. v. DeWitt, 18

A. 724, 725 (Pa. 1889) (“In common with animals, and unlike
other minerals, [oil, gas, and water] have the power and the tendency to escape

without the volition of the owner.”). Accordingly, such
minerals are subject to the rule of capture, which is

[a] fundamental principle of oil-and-gas law holding that
there is no liability for drainage of oil and gas from under the lands of

another so long as there has been no trespass....

Black’s Law Dictionary 1358 (8th ed. 2004)); accord Brown v.
Spilman, 155 U.S. 665, 669–70 (1895). A corollary to this rule is that an

aggrieved property owner’s remedy for the loss, through
drainage, of subsurface oil or gas has traditionally been to offset the effects
of the

developer’s well by drilling his or her own well, often
termed an “offset well.” See Barnard v. Monongahela Gas Co., 65 A. 801, 803
(Pa. 1907)

(“What then can the neighbor do? Nothing; only go and do
likewise.”).

The reference to “the lands of another” in the above quote
does not suggest a developer may invade the subsurface area of a neighboring

#189

property by drilling at an angle rather than vertically
(referred to as slant drilling or slant wells), or by drilling horizontally
beneath the surface.

This is because the title holder of a parcel of land
generally owns everything directly beneath the surface. Rather, and as
suggested by the “no

trespass” predicate, it refers to the potential for oil and
gas to migrate from the plaintiff’s property to the developer’s land when
extracted from a

common pool or reservoir spanning both parcels.

Finally, the rule of capture applies even where devices such
as pumps are used to bring the mineral to the surface and thereby reduce the

production of neighboring wells.

B.Hydraulic fracturing

One of the central questions in this matter involves how
these principles apply where hydraulic fracturing is used to extract oil or gas
from

subsurface geological formations. Drillers have enhanced the
output of oil and gas wells by fracturing the geological formations for over a

century. Initially they used explosives. Hydraulic
fracturing was developed in the 1940s, and has been used in Pennsylvania since
1954.

Although it would be impractical to set forth a
comprehensive description of the technique in the context of the present
controversy, there are

certain material aspects which are not in dispute. According
to the federal government, hydraulic fracturing is

used in “unconventional” gas production. “Unconventional”
reservoirs can cost-effectively produce gas only by using a special

stimulation technique, like hydraulic fracturing.... This is
often because the gas is highly dispersed in the rock, rather than occurring

in a concentrated underground location.

United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”),
The Process of Unconventional Natural Gas Production, https://
http://www.epa.gov/

uog/ process-unconventional-natural-gas-production (viewed
Oct. 22, 2019). In terms of how the technique works, the EPA continues:

Fractures are created by pumping large quantities of fluids
at high pressure down a wellbore and into the target rock formation.

Hydraulic fracturing fluid commonly consists of water,
proppant and chemical additives that open and enlarge fractures within the rock

formation. These fractures can extend several hundred feet
away from the wellbore. The proppants—sand, ceramic pellets or other

small incompressible particles—hold open the newly created
fractures.

Id.

After injection, fluid is withdrawn from the well while
leaving the proppants in place to hold the fissures open. This enhances the
drainage

of oil or gas into the wellbore where it can be captured.

#190

C.Factual and procedural history of this case

(i)Introduction

This appeal comes to us in a somewhat unusual posture. The
parties presently favor essentially the same rule of law: they both, in
substance,

argue that the traditional rule of capture should apply,
subject to the common-law standard for trespass of real property based on
physical

intrusion onto another’s land. See Restatement (Second) of
Torts § 158 & cmt. i (1965) (indicating liability follows from the
defendant’s entry

onto the plaintiff’s property, and noting this includes
throwing, propelling, or placing a thing on the land or above or beneath its
surface). Each

party, moreover, depicts the other as erroneously suggesting
that an exception to this framework should pertain where hydraulic fracturing
is used

to obtain oil or natural gas. In particular, the plaintiffs
suggest that Southwestern wishes to convert the rule of capture into a precept
whereby

energy developers may physically invade the property of
others to capture natural gas so long as they are using hydraulic fracturing.
For its part,

Southwestern portrays the plaintiffs and the Superior Court
decision from which it appeals as positing that the rule of capture simply does
not

apply when hydraulic fracturing is used for energy
development on one’s own land.

To maintain these positions, the parties proceed from a
different understanding of the relevant factual and procedural history. * * *

(ii)Undisputed facts

Adam, Paula, Joshua, and Sarah Briggs (“Plaintiffs”) own a
parcel of real estate consisting of approximately eleven acres in Harford

Township, Susquehanna County. During all relevant times,
Plaintiffs have not leased their property to any entity for natural gas
production.

Plaintiffs’ property is adjacent to a tract of land leased
by Appellant Southwestern Energy Production Company for natural gas extraction
(the

“Production Parcel”). Southwestern maintains wellbores on
the Production Parcel and has used hydraulic fracturing to boost natural gas

extraction from the Marcellus Shale formation through those
wellbores.

(iii)Proceedings before the Court of Common Pleas

In November 2015, Plaintiffs commenced an action against
Southwestern in which they stated two causes of action, trespass and

conversion. * * * Notably, Plaintiffs did not expressly
allege that Southwestern’s activities had caused a physical intrusion into
Plaintiffs’

property.

Southwestern filed a responsive pleading denying it had
extracted gas from Plaintiffs’ land and denying it had trespassed upon
Plaintiffs’

property or converted their natural gas. Southwestern
specifically denied it had drilled underneath Plaintiffs’ property and stated,
further, that it

had “only drilled for oil, gas or minerals from under
properties for which [Southwestern] has leases.”

#191

* * *Southwestern alleged that Plaintiffs’ claims were
    barred by, inter alia , the rule of capture. * * *

In their supporting brief, Plaintiffs suggested, for the
first time, that Southwestern’s hydraulic fracturing activities may have caused
a

disturbance of the subsurface area of their land in the form
of rock fractures propagating horizontally from the wellbore, albeit that,
again, they

did not expressly contend that Southwestern had injected any
material substances into their land. * * *

(v)Southwestern’s request for discretionary review

In seeking this Court’s review, Southwestern initially
mentioned that Plaintiffs had not alleged that Southwestern physically intruded
onto

their property. * * * As such, Southwestern framed a single
issue for our review, as follows:

Does the rule of capture apply to oil and gas produced from
wells that were completed using hydraulic fracturing and preclude trespass

liability for allegedly draining oil or gas from under
nearby property, where the well is drilled solely on and beneath the driller’s
own

property and the hydraulic fracturing fluids are injected
solely on or beneath the driller’s own property?

---

II.Preliminary Discussion

A.Trespass

In Pennsylvania, a trespass occurs when a person who is not
privileged to do so intrudes upon land in possession of another, whether

willfully or by mistake. * * *

[Southwestern] articulated the issue for this Court’s
consideration in terms of whether the rule of capture should be applied in the
same

manner it has always been applied: to allow for the capture
of oil and gas which merely drains from an adjacent property after the
completion of

a well using hydraulic fracturing solely within the
developer’s property. This is an issue, again, on which the parties do not
presently diverge:

they both answer in the affirmative. Their disagreement is
limited to whether any physical intrusion has taken place—a question that is
not fairly

subsumed within the issue framed for our review.

III.Analysis

The issue as stated by Southwestern should nonetheless be
resolved for purposes of this dispute—and to provide guidance to the bench and

bar—because at least part of the Superior Court’s opinion
can reasonably be construed as setting forth a per se rule foreclosing
application of the

rule of capture in hydraulic fracturing scenarios, and that
rule rests on faulty assumptions. In particular, and most saliently, the panel
appears to

have indicated that one litmus for whether the rule of
capture applies is whether the defendant’s gas extraction methodology relies
only on the

natural drainage of oil or gas within a conventional pool or
reservoir, or

#192

whether instead those methods utilize some means of
artificial stimulation to induce drainage.

The Superior Court’s position in this respect logically
rests on one of two grounds: (a) the act of artificially stimulating the
cross-boundary

flow through the use of hydraulic fracturing solely on the
developer’s property in and of itself renders the rule of capture inapplicable;
or (b) as

Plaintiffs argue, any time natural gas migrates across
property lines resulting, directly or indirectly, from hydraulic fracturing, a
physical

intrusion into the plaintiff’s property must necessarily
have taken place.

As to the first proposition, all drilling for subsurface
fugacious minerals involves the artificial stimulation of the flow of that
substance. The

mere act of drilling interferes with nature and stimulates
the flow of the minerals toward artificially-created low pressure areas, most
notably, the

wellbore. This Court has held that the rule of capture
applies although the driller uses further artificial means, such as a pump, to
enhance

production from a source common to it and the plaintiff—so
long as no physical invasion of the plaintiff’s land occurs. See Jones v.
Forest Oil

Co., 44 A. 1074 , 1075 (Pa. 1900 ) (indicating that, absent
physical intrusion, a developer may use “all the skill and invention of which a
man is

capable” to appropriate resources from under his own
property). There is no reason why this precept should apply any differently to
hydraulic

fracturing conducted solely within the driller’s property. *

The Superior Court may have believed it should impose a
different rule because of the added expense associated with hydraulic
fracturing

as compared to conventional drilling. It expressed its
concern that drilling an offset well may not be as affordable to an aggrieved
landowner

today as it was in the era when conventional drilling was
still able profitably to produce oil and natural gas. Southwestern observes,
however, that

both types of drilling are costly and specialized, and
posits that the traditional self-help remedy is still available—as a
neighboring landowner

may enter into a lease with an energy developer to drill a
well and obtain oil or gas through hydraulic fracturing, and be compensated

accordingly.

Hydraulic fracturing may be more expensive than conventional
drilling and, as a consequence, the feasibility of drilling an offset well may

be diminished for some landowners. The judiciary nonetheless
lacks institutional tools necessary to investigate the continuing feasibility
of self-

help remedies under the myriad of circumstances that may
present themselves in the context of a dispute such as this one. The
legislative branch

is not similarly constrained, and if the General Assembly
believes that additional measures are needed in favor of small landowners, it
is in a

better position to ascertain the need for such measures and
to articulate their details. Accordingly, we reject as a matter of law the
concept that the

rule of capture is inapplicable to drilling and hydraulic
fracturing that occurs entirely within the developer’s property solely because
drainage of

natural resources takes place as the direct or indirect

#193

result of hydraulic fracturing, or that such drainage stems
from less “natural” means than conventional drainage.

The second predicate—that drainage from under a plaintiff’s
parcel can only occur if the driller first physically invades that
property—does

not lend itself to a purely legal resolution. By design,
hydraulic fracturing creates fissures in rock strata which store hydrocarbons
within their

porous structure. On the state of the present record, this
alone does not establish that a physical intrusion into a neighboring property
is necessary

for such action to result in drainage from that property. We
cannot rule out, for example, that a fissure created through the injection of
hydraulic

fluid entirely within the developer’s property may create a
sufficient pressure gradient to induce the drainage of hydrocarbons from the
relevant

stratum of rock underneath an adjacent parcel even absent
physical intrusion. Nor can we discount the possibility that a fissure created
within the

developer’s property may communicate with other,
pre-existing fissures that reach across property lines. Whether these, or any
other non-

invasive means of drainage occasioned by hydraulic
fracturing, are physically possible in a given case is a factual question to be
established

through expert evidence. * * *

V.Summary and Conclusion

In summary, the parties to the appeal are in agreement—and
we concur as well—that the rule of capture remains extant in Pennsylvania,

and developers who use hydraulic fracturing may rely on
pressure differentials to drain oil and gas from under another’s property, at
least in the

absence of a physical invasion. The Superior Court panel
erred to the extent it assumed that either (a) the use of hydraulic fracturing
alters this

rule, or (b) where hydraulic fracturing is utilized, such
physical invasion is a necessary precondition in all cases for drainage to
occur from

underneath another property. More broadly, insofar as the
panel’s decision may be construed to suggest that a
natural-versus-artificially-induced-

flow litmus should be employed to determine whether the rule
of capture applies in a given situation, that standard rests on a false
distinction and

is disapproved.

The order of the Superior Court is vacated and the matter is
remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

■
JUSTICE DOUGHERTY (concurring and dissenting). I join the majority’s holding
that the rule of capture remains effective in Pennsylvania to

protect a developer from trespass liability where there has
been no physical invasion of another’s property. In so holding, the majority
correctly

recognizes that if there is such a physical invasion the
rule of capture will not insulate a developer engaged in hydraulic fracturing
from trespass

liability. As I agree with both propositions, I also agree
the matter should be remanded for further proceedings involving a specific
inquiry into a

physical invasion. I respectfully dissent, however, from the
notion that this question must be determined by the Superior Court on

#194

the present record, and would instead remand to the trial
court for completion of the discovery that was forestalled by erroneous summary

judgment, and for trial, if necessary. * * *

Finally, I make the following observations relating to the
rule of capture in the context of fracking of non-conventional shale deposits.
First,

although I recognize natural gas has a “fugacious” nature
regardless of whether it lies in an open pool or in a sandstone or shale
deposit, it is

clear that natural gas trapped in shale drains naturally
much more slowly than from a pool or from other materials; indeed, this is the
very reason

developers engage in fracking, to make shale gas development
productive faster, that is, more efficient and economically viable. The
practice

exploits natural shale fractures and creates new ones, and
with present technology, much remains mysterious about precisely what happens
so far

beneath the surface. However, I do not view this uncertainty
as a basis to absolve developers from trespass liability if a plaintiff can
prove the

fluids and proppants they intentionally injected into their
wellbores travelled horizontally across property lines and caused drainage of
gas

previously trapped under the plaintiff’s land.

#NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1. _Briggs_ and other recent decisions that address
   conflicts between adjacent surface owners over the use of hydraulic fracturing
   technology, most

notably _Coastal Oil & Gas Corp. v. Garza Energy Trust_
, 268 S.W. 3 d 1 (Tex. 2008 ), present a conflict between the principle of
first possession (the rule

of capture as applied to fugacious minerals like oil and
gas) and accession (the _ad coelum_ principle that says the owner of the
surface owns the column

of space extending downward vertically for an indefinite
distance below the surface). If a jurisdiction is committed to both principles,
how should they

be reconciled or integrated?

2. _Physical intrusion_. The parties and the court agree
   that any kind of slant drilling—drilling that starts on surface controlled by
   the production

company that angles as it proceeds underground into the
column of space under an adjacent property owner—is barred under the law of
trespass.

Likewise, the court assumes that a well bore that proceeds
downward vertically within the column of space controlled by the production
company,

which then turns and horizontally enters into the column of
space of an adjacent property owner, would be a trespass. (Horizontal drilling
is a common

feature of “fracking” technology, both for enhanced recovery
of natural gas and oil.) What is the rationale for treating as a trespass any
intentional use of

slant drilling or horizontal drilling that intrudes into the
column of space beneath the land of a non-consenting surface owner? Is this
carrying the _ad

coelum_ principle to an unwarranted extreme? After all, one
rationale for limiting trespass liability to tangible intrusions is that this
puts the landholder on

notice that there has been an invasion. Subsurface
intrusions by drill bits can be detected only with the aid of sophisticated
sonar devices. Or does the _ad

coelum_ principle in this context provide an

```



195



```

important baseline for negotiations among landowners over
various rights to extract valuable minerals?

3. _Trespass by cracks?_ The court holds that if there is no
   physical intrusion by a production company into the column of space of an
   adjacent

property owner, the drainage of natural gas caused by
hydraulic fracturing is privileged under the rule of capture. The court does
not reach the question

whether Southwestern did or did not commit a physical
intrusion into the plaintiffs subsurface through the use of fracturing
technology. Aside from slant

or horizontal drilling, what would constitute a trespassory
invasion in this context? If the well bore stops short of the boundary of the
plaintiff’s

subsurface rights, and the defendant injects water,
proppants like sand, and chemicals into the area underneath the plaintiff’s
surface rights, is this a

trespass? What if the water, proppants, and chemicals stop
short of the boundary, but the pressure exerted by this concoction
(colloquially called

slickwater) causes cracks to form in the rock underneath the
plaintiff’s surface rights? As things stand, these questions remain unanswered
in oil and gas

producing states. Should the answer turn on the state of
mind of the production company, i.e., whether the company intended or knew to a
high degree of

certainty whether the slickwater would enter the subsurface
space of another? Should the deliberate creation of cracks in the rock in the
subsurface of

another be subject to liability as a nuisance but not as a
trespass? For discussion, see Keith B. Hall, Hydraulic Facturing: If Fractures
Cross Property

Lines, Is There an Actionable Subsurface Trespass?, 54 Nat.
Res. J. 361 ( 2014 ).

4 .Ad coelum _and overflights_. In _Garza_ , supra, the
Texas Supreme Court joined the Pennsylvania court in holding that drainage from
the

subsurface rights of another landowner caused by the use of
fracturing technology is protected under the rule of capture. In contrast to
the Pennsylvania

Supreme Court, however, the Texas court held that subsurface
trespass by fracturing fluids and cracks should be actionable only if this
activity can be

shown to cause substantial harm to the surface rights of the
nonconsenting owner. In support of this conclusion, the Texas court seemingly
drew an

analogy to airplane overflights, and the provision of the
Restatement (Second) of Torts that says overflights are actionable as a
trespass only if they

cause substantial harm to the surface. 268 S.W. 3 d at 11.
Is this a better solution than the inquiry apparently contemplated by the
Pennsylvania court,

into whether fracturing fluids have been injected across a
subterranean boundary? For a variety of perspectives, see Owen L. Anderson,
Subsurface

“Trespass”: A Man’s Subsurface is Not His Castle, 49

#### Goddard v. Winchell

```



Supreme Court of Iowa, 1892.



52 N.W. 1124.



```

■
GRANGER, J. The district court found the following facts, with some others, not
important on this trial: “That the plaintiff, John Goodard, is, and

has been since about 1857, the owner in fee simple of the
north half of section No. three, in township No. ninety-eight, range No.
twenty-five, in

Winnebago county, Iowa, and was such owner at the time of
the fall of the meteorite hereinafter referred to. (2) That said land was
prairie land,

and that the grass privilege for the year 1890 was leased to
one James Elickson. (3) That on the 2d day of May, 1890, an aerolite passed
over

northern and northwestern Iowa, and the aerolite, or
fragment of the same, in question in this action, weighing, when replevied, and
when

produced in court on the trial of this cause, about 66
pounds, fell onto plaintiff’s land, described above, and buried itself in the
ground to a depth

of three feet, and became imbedded therein at a point about
20 rods from the section line on the north. (4) That the day after the aerolite
in

question fell it was dug out of the ground with a spade by
one Peter Hoagland, in the presence of the tenant, Elickson; that said Hoagland
took it

to his house, and claimed to own same, for the reason that
he had found same and dug it up. (5) That on May 5, 1890, Hoagland sold the
aerolite

in suit to the defendant, H. V. Winchell, for $105, and the
same was at once taken possession of by said defendant, and that the possession
was

held by him until same was taken under the writ of replevin
herein; that defendant knew at the time of his purchase that it was an
aerolite, and

that it fell on the prairie south of Hoagland’s land. * * *
(10) I find the value of said aerolite to be one hundred and one dollars ($101)
as verbally

stipulated in open court by the parties to this action; that
the same weighs about 66 pounds, is of a black, smoky color on the outside,
showing the

effects of heat, and of a lighter and darkish gray color on
the inside; that it is an aerolite, and fell from the heavens on the 2d of May,
1890; that a

member of Hoagland’s family saw the aerolite fall, and
directed him to it.”

As conclusions of law, the district court found that the
aerolite became a part of the soil on which it fell; that the plaintiff was the
owner

thereof; and that the act of Hoagland in removing it was
wrongful. It is insisted by appellant that the conclusions of law are
erroneous; that the

enlightened demands of the time in which we live call for,
if not a modification, a liberal construction, of the ancient rule, “that
whatever is

affixed to the soil belongs to the soil,” or, the more
modern statement of the rule, that “a permanent annexation to the soil, of a
thing in itself

personal, makes it a part of the realty.” In behalf of
appellant is invoked a rule alike ancient and of undoubted merit, “that of
title by occupancy;”

and we are cited to the language of Blackstone, as follows:
“Occupancy is the taking possession of those things which before belonged to

nobody;” and “whatever movables are found upon the surface
of the earth, or in

#197

the sea, and are unclaimed by any owner, are supposed to be
abandoned by the last proprietor, and as such are returned into the common
stock

and mass of things; and therefore they belong, as in a state
of nature, to the first occupant or finder.” * * *

If, from what we have said, we have in mind the facts giving
rise to the rules cited, we may well look to the facts of this case to properly

distinguish it. The subject of the dispute is an aerolite,
of about 66 pounds’ weight, that “fell from the heavens” on the land of the
plaintiff, and

was found three feet below the surface. It came to its
position in the earth through natural causes. It was one of nature’s deposits,
with nothing in

its material composition to make it foreign or unnatural to
the soil. It was not a movable thing “on the earth.” It was in the earth, and
in a very

significant sense immovable; that is, it was only movable as
parts of earth are made movable by the hand of man. Except for the peculiar
manner

in which it came, its relation to the soil would be beyond
dispute. It was in its substance, as we understand, a stone. It was not of a
character to be

thought of as “unclaimed by any owner,” and, because
unclaimed, “supposed to be abandoned by the last proprietor,” as should be the
case under

the rule invoked by appellant. In fact, it has none of the
characteristics of the property contemplated by such a rule.

We may properly note some of the particular claims of
appellant. * * * The general rules of the law, by which the owners of riparian
titles

are made to lose or gain by the doctrine of accretions, are
quite familiar. These rules are not, however, of exclusive application to such
owners.

Through the action of the elements, wind and water, the soil
of one man is taken and deposited in the field of another; and thus all over
the

country, we may say, changes are constantly going on. By
these natural causes the owners of the soil are giving and taking as the wisdom
of the

controlling forces shall determine. By these operations one
may be affected with a substantial gain, and another by a similar loss. These
gains are

of accretion, and the deposit becomes the property of the
owner of the soil on which it is made.

A scientist of note has said that from six to seven hundred
of these stones fall to our earth annually. If they are, as indicated in
argument,

departures from other planets, and if among the planets of
the solar system there is this interchange, bearing evidence of their material

composition, upon what principle of reason or authority can
we say that a deposit thus made shall not be of that class of property that it
would be

if originally of this planet and in the same situation? * *

* It is not easy to understand why stones or balls of metallic iron, deposited
  as this was,

should be governed by a different rule than obtains from the
deposit of boulders, stones, and drift upon our prairies by glacier action; and
who

would contend that these deposits from floating bodies of
ice belong, not to the owner of the soil, but to the finder? Their origin or
source may be

less mysterious, but they, too, are “telltale messengers”
from far-off lands, and have value for historic and scientific investigation.

#198

It is said that the aerolite is without adaptation to the
soil, and only valuable for scientific purposes. Nothing in the facts of the
case will

warrant us in saying that it was not as well adapted for use
by the owner of the soil as any stone, or, as appellant is pleased to
denominate it, “ball

of metallic iron.” That it may be of greater value for
scientific or other purposes may be admitted, but that fact has little weight
in determining

who should be its owner. We cannot say that the owner of the
soil is not as interested in, and would not as readily contribute to, the great
cause of

scientific advancement, as the finder, by chance or
otherwise, of these silent messengers. This aerolite is of the value of $101,
and this fact, if no

other, would remove it from uses where other and much less
valuable materials would answer an equally good purpose, and place it in the
sphere

of its greater usefulness.

The rule is cited, with cases for its support, that the
finder of lost articles, even where they are found on the property, in the
building, or with

the personal effects of third persons, is the owner thereof
against all the world except the true owner. The correctness of the rule may be

conceded, but its application to the case at bar is very
doubtful. The subject of this controversy was never lost or abandoned. Whence
it came is

not known, but, under the natural law of its government, it
became a part of this earth, and, we think, should be treated as such. * * *

The judgment of the district court is affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Horace Winchell, the defendant in this action, was a
geologist with the University of Minnesota and an avid collector of aerolites,
or meteorites

as they are more commonly called today. When Winchell heard
about a large meteorite shower near Forest City, Iowa, he hastened to the site.
He arrived

at Peter Hoagland’s farm at the same time as William
Bradford, a local lawyer who evidently sought to acquire the aerolite to resell
it for a profit, and a

bidding war ensued. Bradford would not pay more than $ 100 ,
so Winchell won. The lawyer later discovered that the aerolite had fallen on
Goddard’s

land, not Hoagland’s, and sued out a writ of replevin in
Goddard’s name, posting a bond for twice the value of the stone (see Chapter IV
for more on

replevin). This caused the sheriff to seize the aerolite at
the train station, as Winchell was preparing to ship it to Minneapolis. Before
the first replevin

was tried, Winchell persuaded the University to bring a
second replevin action, posting an even higher bond. This caused the sheriff to
seize the stone

again and turn it back over to Winchell, who spirited it out
of the state in a mad dash. The decision reproduced here is the appeal from the
first replevin

action. Once the Iowa Supreme Court decided the question of
title, the only issue in the second action was damages. The jury in this second
action fixed

the value at $ 480 , which the University paid rather than
give up the stone. See Horace V. Winchell, A Meteoric Career, A True Story, 131
Atlantic

Monthly 779 (June 1923 ). According to Professor E. Calvin
Alexander, Jr. of the University of Minnesota Department of Geology and
Geophysics, the

“Forest City Meteorite” remains the property of the

```



199



```

University of Minnesota, although it has been on loan to the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. for several decades.

2 .The court here may have thought that it had no easy out
based on trespass. Goddard, the owner of the pasture where the aerolite fell,
had leased

the land to Elickson as tenant. A tenant typically exercises
full possessory rights over leased property, including the right to determine
who may and may

not enter the land and on what terms. Since Elickson had
granted permission to Hoagland to enter the field and recover the aerolite, it
would have been

difficult to award the aerolite to Goddard on the simple
ground that Hoagland was a trespasser. On the other hand, someone who exceeds
the scope of an

owner’s consent (in the form of a license or easement, see
Chapters IV and IX) becomes a trespasser even if his initial entry was lawful.
In this case, the

tenant Elickson had only the “grass privilege,” probably
meaning that Elickson had no right to dig for minerals. Would it have exceeded
the scope of

Elickson’s rights if he had dug the aerolite out of the
ground himself? If Elickson likewise had no actual authority to authorize
digging by Hoagland,

does that make Hoagland a trespasser? Would this depend on
what Hoagland reasonably believed about the scope of Elickson’s rights? How
would we

expect Hoagland to inform himself about such matters?

3 .How important to the result is it that the aerolite was
buried three feet into the ground? Suppose it came down and bounced off a piece
of

granite, and thus stayed on the surface of the land. Same
result? Consider the famous Hodges meteorite. On November 30 , 1954 , an 8 ½
pound fragment

of a meteorite fell through the roof of a house in
Sylacauga, Alabama, bounced off a console radio, and struck Ann Hodges who, not
feeling well, had

been napping on the living-room couch. (See Figure 2 - 9 .)
Hodges was painfully but not seriously injured in the arm and hip and was later
hospitalized,

partly to avoid the clamor of press and curiosity seekers
who descended on the Hodges home. Hodges and her husband occupied the house
under a

lease, and later the Hodges and their landlord, Birdie Guy,
got into a legal dispute over who was the owner of the meteorite. Guy’s
attorney believed that

caselaw supported Mrs. Guy’s position, based on her
ownership of the real property. But public opinion was firmly behind Mrs.
Hodges, in part because

the meteorite had physically struck her. Should this affect
the analysis of the rival claims of ownership? What would Hume and Sugden say?
After

preliminary sparring (including a threat by Mrs. Hodges to
sue Mrs. Guy for her injuries if she was awarded ownership of the meteorite),
the case was

settled in September 1955 , with Mrs. Hodges paying Mrs. Guy
$ 500 to relinquish her claim. Mrs. Hodges donated the meteorite the next year
to the

Alabama Museum of Natural History, where it is on permanent
display. According to John Hall, retired assistant director of the museum, “the
only

person with a positive experience in the incident was Julius
Kempis McKinney, a black farmer,” who found a smaller fragment of the same
meteorite in

the road where he was driving his mules. He brought it home,
wound up selling it to the Smithsonian, and purchased a car and a new house
from the

proceeds of the sale. M.J. Ellington, A Star Fell on

```



King’s Bench Division, 1945.



[ 1945 ] K.B. 509.



```

On December 13, 193 8, the freehold of Gwernhaylod House,
Overton-on-Dee, Shropshire, was conveyed to the defendant, Major Hugh

Edward Ethelston Peel, who from that time to the end of 1940
never himself occupied the house and it remained unoccupied until October 5,

1939, when it was requisitioned, but after some months was
released from requisition. Thereafter it remained unoccupied until July 18,
1940,

when it was again requisitioned, the defendant being
compensated by a payment at the rate of £250 a year. In August, 1940, the
plaintiff, Duncan

Hannah, a lance-corporal, serving in a battery of the Royal
Artillery, was stationed at the house and on the 21st of that month, when in a

bedroom, used as a sick-bay, he was adjusting the black-out
curtains when his hand touched something on the top of a window-frame, loose in
a

crevice, which he thought was a piece of dirt or plaster.
The plaintiff grasped it and dropped it on the outside window ledge. On the
following

morning he

#201

saw that it was a brooch covered with cobwebs and dirt.
Later, he took it with him when he went home on leave and his wife having told
him it

might be of value, at the end of October, 1940, he informed
his commanding officer of his find and, on his advice, handed it over to the
police,

receiving a receipt for it. In August, 1942, the owner not
having been found the police handed the brooch to the defendant, who sold it in

October, 19 42, for £66, to Messrs. Spink & Son, Ltd.,
of London, who resold it in the following month for £88. There was no evidence
that the

defendant had any knowledge of the existence of the brooch
before it was found by the plaintiff. The defendant had offered the plaintiff a
reward

for the brooch, but the plaintiff refused to accept this and
maintained throughout his right to the possession of the brooch as against all
persons

other than the owner, who was unknown. By a letter, dated
October 5, 1942, the plaintiff’s solicitors demanded the return of the brooch
from the

defendant, but it was not returned and on October 21, 1943,
the plaintiff issued his writ claiming the return of the brooch, or its value,
and

damages for its detention. By his defence, the defendant
claimed the brooch on the ground that he was the owner of Gwernhaylod House and
in

possession thereof.

■
BIRKETT J. There is no issue of fact in this case between the parties. As to
the issue in law, the rival claims of the parties can be stated in this

way: The plaintiff says: “I claim the brooch as its finder
and I have a good title against all the world, save only the true owner.” The
defendant

says: “My claim is superior to yours inasmuch as I am the
freeholder. The brooch was found on my property, although I was never in
occupation,

and my title, therefore, ousts yours and in the absence of
the true owner I am entitled to the brooch or its value.” Unhappily the law on
this issue

is in a very uncertain state and there is need of an
authoritative decision of a higher court. Obviously if it could be said with
certainty that this is

the law, that the finder of a lost article, wherever found,
has a good title against all the world save the true owner, then, of course,
all my

difficulties would be resolved; or again, if it could be
said with equal certainty that this is the law, that the possessor of land is
entitled as against

the finder to all chattels found on the land, again my
difficulties would be resolved. But, unfortunately, the authorities give some
support to each

of these conflicting propositions.

In the famous case of Armory v. Delamirie , 1 Str. 505 (K.
B. 1722), the plaintiff, who was a chimney sweeper’s boy, found a jewel and

carried it to the defendant’s shop, who was a goldsmith, in
order to know what it was, and he delivered it into the hands of the apprentice
in the

goldsmith’s shop, who made a pretence of weighing it and
took out the stones and called to the master to let him know that it came to
three-

halfpence. The master offered the boy the money who refused
to take it and insisted on having the jewel again. Whereupon the apprentice
handed

him back the socket of the jewel without the stones, and an
action was brought in trover against the master, and it was ruled “that the

#202

finder of a jewel, though he does not by such finding
acquire an absolute property or ownership, yet he has such a property as will
enable him to

keep it against all but the rightful owner, and consequently
may maintain trover.” The case of Bridges v. Hawkesworth, 21 L. J.R. 75 (Q. B.

1851) 75, is in process of becoming almost equally as famous
      because of the disputation which has raged around it. The headnote in the
      Jurist is

as follows: “The place in which a lost article is found does
not constitute any exception to the general rule of law, that the finder is
entitled to it

as against all persons except the owner.” * * * The facts
appear to have been that in the year 1847 the plaintiff, who was a commercial
traveller,

called on a firm named Byfield & Hawkesworth on
business, as he was in the habit of doing, and as he was leaving the shop he
picked up a small

parcel which was lying on the floor. He immediately showed
it to the shopman, and opened it in his presence, when it was found to consist
of a

quantity of Bank of England notes, to the amount of £65. The
defendant, who was a partner in the firm of Byfield & Hawkesworth, was then

called, and the plaintiff told him he had found the notes,
and asked the defendant to keep them until the owner appeared to claim them.
Then

various advertisements were put in the papers asking for the
owner, but the true owner was never found. No person having appeared to claim

them, and three years having elapsed since they were found,
the plaintiff applied to the defendant to have the notes returned to him, and
offered

to pay the expenses of the advertisements, and to give an
indemnity. The defendant refused to deliver them up to the plaintiff, and an
action was

brought in the county court of Westminster in consequence of
that refusal. The county court judge decided that the defendant, the
shopkeeper,

was entitled to the custody of the notes as against the
plaintiff, and gave judgment for the defendant. Thereupon the appeal was
brought which

came before the court composed of Patteson J. and Wightman
J. Patteson J. said: “The notes which are the subject of this action were
incidentally

dropped, by mere accident, in the shop of the defendant, by
the owner of them. The facts do not warrant the supposition that they had been

deposited there intentionally, nor has the case been put at
all upon that ground. The plaintiff found them on the floor, they being
manifestly lost

by someone. The general right of the finder to any article
which has been lost, as against all the world, except the true owner, was
established in

the case of Armory v. Delamirie which has never been
disputed. This right would clearly have accrued to the plaintiff had the notes
been picked

up by him outside the shop of the defendant and if he once
had the right, the case finds that he did not intend, by delivering the notes
to the

defendant, to waive the title (if any) which he had to them,
but they were handed to the defendant merely for the purpose of delivering them
to

the owner should he appear.” Then a little later: “The case,
therefore, resolves itself into the single point on which it appears that the
learned

judge decided it, namely, whether the circumstance of the
notes being found inside the defendant’s shop gives him, the defendant, the
right to

have them as against the plaintiff, who

#203

found them.” After discussing the cases, and the argument,
the learned judge said: “If the discovery had never been communicated to the

defendant, could the real owner have had any cause of action
against him because they were found in his house? Certainly not. The notes
never

were in the custody of the defendant, nor within the
protection of his house, before they were found, as they would have been had
they been

intentionally deposited there; and the defendant has come
under no responsibility, except from the communication made to him by the
plaintiff,

the finder, and the steps taken by way of advertisement...
.We find, therefore, no circumstances in this case to take it out of the
general rule of

law, that the finder of a lost article is entitled to it as
against all persons except the real owner, and we think that that rule must
prevail, and that

the learned judge was mistaken in holding that the place in
which they were found makes any legal difference. Our judgment, therefore, is
that

the plaintiff is entitled to these notes as against the
defendant.”

It is to be observed that in Bridges v. Hawkesworth which
has been the subject of immense disputation, neither counsel put forward any

argument on the fact that the notes were found in a shop.
Counsel for the appellant assumed throughout that the position was the same as
if the

parcel had been found in a private house, and the learned
judge spoke of “the protection of his” (the shopkeeper’s) “house.” The case for
the

appellant was that the shopkeeper never knew of the notes.
Again, what is curious is that there was no suggestion that the place where the
notes

were found was in any way material; indeed, the judge in
giving the judgment of the court expressly repudiates this and said in terms
“The

learned judge was mistaken in holding that the place in
which they were found makes any legal difference.” * * *

With regard to South Staffordshire Water Co. v. Sharman,
[1896] 2 Q. B. 44 (1896), the first two lines of the headnote are: “The
possessor

of land is generally entitled, as against the finder, to
chattels found on the land.” I am not sure that this is accurate. The facts
were that the

defendant Sharman, while cleaning out, under the orders of
the plaintiffs, the South Staffordshire Water Company, a pool of water on their
land,

found two rings embedded in the mud at the bottom of the
pool. He declined to deliver them to the plaintiffs, but failed to discover the
real

owner. In an action brought by the company against Sharman
in detinue it was held that the company were entitled to the rings. Lord
Russell of

Killowen C.J. said (id. at 46): “The plaintiffs are the
freeholders of the locus in quo, and as such they have the right to forbid
anybody coming on

their land or in any way interfering with it. They had the
right to say that their pool should be cleaned out in any way that they thought
fit, and to

direct what should be done with anything found in the pool
in the course of such cleaning out. It is no doubt right, as the counsel for
the

defendant contended, to say that the plaintiffs must show
that they had actual control over the locus in quo and the things in it; but
under the

#204

circumstances, can it be said that the Minster Pool and
whatever might be in that pool were not under the control of the plaintiffs? In
my opinion

they were.... The principle on which this case must be
decided, and the distinction which must be drawn between this case and that of
Bridges

v. Hawkesworth, is to be found in a passage in Pollock and
Wright’s ‘Essay on Possession in the Common Law,’ p. 41: ‘The possession of
land

carries with it in general, by our law, possession of
everything which is attached to or under that land, and, in the absence of a
better title

elsewhere, the right to possess it also’.” If that is right,
it would clearly cover the case of the rings embedded in the mud of the pool,
the words

used being “attached to or under that land.” Lord Russell
continued: “ ‘And it makes no difference that the possessor is not aware of the
thing’s

existence.... It is free to anyone who requires a specific
intention as part of a de facto possession to treat this as a positive rule of
law. But it

seems preferable to say that the legal possession rests on a
real de facto possession constituted by the occupier’s general power and intent
to

exclude unauthorized interference.’ That is the ground on
which I prefer to base my judgment. There is a broad distinction between this
case and

those cited from Blackstone. Those were cases in which a
thing was cast into a public place or into the sea—into a place, in fact, of
which it

could not be said that anyone had a real de facto
possession, or a general power and intent to exclude unauthorized
interference.” Then Lord

Russell cited the passage which I read earlier in this
judgment and continued: “It is somewhat strange”—I venture to echo those
words—“that

there is no more direct authority on the question; but the
general principle seems to me to be that where a person has possession of house
or land,

with a manifest intention to exercise control over it and
the things which may be upon or in it, then, if something is found on that
land, whether

by an employee of the owner or by a stranger, the
presumption is that the possession of that thing is in the owner of the locus
in quo.” It is to be

observed that Lord Russell there is extending the meaning of
the passage he had cited from Pollock and Wright’s essay on “Possession in the

Common Law,” where the learned authors say that the
possession of land carries with it possession of everything which is attached
to or under

that land. Then Lord Russell adds possession of everything
which may be on or in that land. South Staffordshire Water Co. v. Sharman,
which

was relied on by counsel for the defendant, has also been
the subject of some discussion. It has been said that it establishes that if a
man finds a

thing as the servant or agent of another, he finds it not
for himself, but for that other, and indeed that seems to afford a sufficient
explanation of

the case. The rings found at the bottom of the pool were not
in the possession of the company, but it seems that though Sharman was the
first to

obtain possession of them, he obtained them for his
employers and could claim no title for himself.

The only other case to which I need refer is Elwes v. Brigg
Gas Co., 33 Ch. D. 562 (1886), in which land had been demised to a gas

company for ninety-nine years with a reservation to the
lessor of all mines and

#205

minerals. A pre-historic boat embedded in the soil was
discovered by the lessees when they were digging to make a gasholder. It was
held that

the boat, whether regarded as a mineral or as part of the
soil in which it was embedded when discovered, or as a chattel, did not pass to
the

lessees by the demise, but was the property of the lessor
though he was ignorant of its existence at the time of granting the lease.
Chitty J. said

(id. at 568): “The first question which does actually arise
in this case is whether the boat belonged to the plaintiff at the time of the
granting of

the lease. I hold that it did, whether it ought to be
regarded as a mineral, or as part of the soil within the maxim above cited, or
as a chattel. If it

was a mineral or part of the soil in the sense above
indicated, then it clearly belonged to the owners of the inheritance as part of
the inheritance

itself. But if it ought to be regarded as a chattel, I hold
the property in the chattel was vested in the plaintiff, for the following
reasons.” Then he

gave the reasons, and continued: “The plaintiff then being
thus in possession of the chattel, it follows that the property in the chattel
was vested

in him. Obviously the right of the original owner could not
be established; it had for centuries been lost or barred, even supposing that
the

property had not been abandoned when the boat was first left
on the spot where it was found. The plaintiff, then, had a lawful possession,
good

against all the world, and therefore the property in the
boat. In my opinion it makes no difference, in these circumstances, that the
plaintiff was

not aware of the existence of the boat.”

A review of these judgments shows that the authorities are
in an unsatisfactory state, and I observe that Sir John Salmond in his book on

Jurisprudence (9th ed., at p. 383), after referring to the
cases of Elwes v. Brigg Gas Co. and South Staffordshire Water Co. v. Sharman,
said:

“Cases such as these, however, are capable of explanation on
other grounds, and do not involve any necessary conflict either with the theory
of

possession or with the cases already cited, such as Bridges
v. Hawkesworth. The general principle is that the first finder of a thing has a
good title

to it against all but the true owner, even though the thing
is found on the property of another person,” and he cites Armory v. Delamirie
and

Bridges v. Hawkesworth in support of that proposition. Then
he continues: “This principle, however, is subject to important exceptions, in
which,

owing to the special circumstances of the case, the better
right is in him on whose property the thing is found,” and he names three cases
as the

principal ones: “When he on whose property the thing is
found is already in possession not merely of the property, but of the thing
itself; as in

certain circumstances, even without specific knowledge, he
undoubtedly may be.” The second limitation Sir John Salmond puts is: “If anyone

finds a thing as the servant or agent of another he finds it
not for himself, but for his employer.” Then: “A third case in which a finder
obtains no

title is that in which he gets possession only through a
trespass or other act of wrongdoing.” It is fairly clear from the authorities
that a man

possesses everything which is attached to or under his land.
Secondly, it would appear to be the law from the authorities I have cited,

#206

and particularly from Bridges v. Hawkesworth, that a man
does not necessarily possess a thing which is lying unattached on the surface
of his

land even though the thing is not possessed by someone else.
A difficulty however, arises, because the rule which governs things an occupier

possesses as against those which he does not, has never been
very clearly formulated in our law. He may possess everything on the land from

which he intends to exclude others, if Mr. Justice Holmes is
right; or he may possess those things of which he has a de facto control, if
Sir

Frederick Pollock is right.

There is no doubt that in this case the brooch was lost in
the ordinary meaning of that term, and I should imagine it had been lost for a
very

considerable time. Indeed, from this correspondence it
appears that at one time the predecessors in title of the defendant were
considering making

some claim. But the moment the plaintiff discovered that the
brooch might be of some value, he took the advice of his commanding officer and

handed it to the police. His conduct was commendable and
meritorious. The defendant was never physically in possession of these premises
at

any time. It is clear that the brooch was never his, in the
ordinary acceptation of the term, in that he had the prior possession. He had
no

knowledge of it, until it was brought to his notice by the
finder. A discussion of the merits does not seem to help, but it is clear on
the facts that

the brooch was “lost” in the ordinary meaning of that word;
that it was “found” by the plaintiff in the ordinary meaning of that word, that
its true

owner has never been found, that the defendant was the owner
of the premises and had his notice drawn to this matter by the plaintiff, who
found

the brooch. In those circumstances I propose to follow the
decision in Bridges v. Hawkesworth, and to give judgment in this case for the
plaintiff

for £66.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .According to a local historian, the Peels were the “lords
of the manor” of Overton and still live in the village today. The main house of
the Peel

estate is Bryn y Pys, located nearby; they purchased
Gwernhaylod in 1934 primarily to add its farmland and woods to their existing
holdings, and they

leased the house to tenants. Consider some further history:

```



I am afraid [Gwernhaylod] suffered the same fate as many
country houses in the U.K. They were requisitioned by the British army 1939 –
46



and after the war were left in such an awful state by the
uncaring and unsupervised soldiers, that they had to be demolished. Windows



```

```



smashed, lead stolen from roofs, led to the weather getting
in and the houses starting to decay and getting into a state that would be too



expensive to repair * * * It was also a time when men
returning from the war had no desire to go back to be servants and the size of
large



houses was impractical to run without servants. The final
blow was the death of Major Hugh Peel in 1950 , leaving his heir, one very
young



granddaughter. The estate was for a time therefore managed
by Trustees on her behalf who



```

```



207



```

```



made the decision to demolish the old house. There is still
a cottage there created from outbuildings of the old house and this is now
lived in



by the Peel estate’s gamekeeper.

2 .Again, there is no easy solution here based on trespass.
Corporal Hannah had full permission to be where he was when he found the
brooch. He

was staying at Gwernhaylod on the orders of the British
Army, which had requisitioned it during the War.

3 .The court appears to give reduced weight to Major Peel’s
interest as owner of the house, on the ground that he had never entered into
actual

possession of the house before the brooch was found. This
seems to tilt the court away from accession towards first possession. Major
Peel’s lack of

possession could hardly be a decisive factor, however, given
the decision in _Elwes v. Brigg Gas Co._ , cited in the main case, which
awarded a pre-historic

boat found buried on the land to the landlord rather than
the tenant gas company that discovered it while digging. One can hardly be more
out of

possession than a landlord under a 99 - year lease. Would
_Hannah v. Peel_ have come out the other way if Gwernhaylod had been Major
Peel’s ancestral

home where he had grown up as a boy?

4 .Suppose the brooch had been discovered by Corporal Hannah
buried under one inch of soil in the garden. Different result? English law

recognizes a special rule for treasure trove, defined to
mean gold, silver, bullion, or money concealed in a hidden place. If the
treasure trove is buried

under ground, it belongs to the Crown. Should the court in
_Hannah_ have

```



208



```

extended this doctrine to award the brooch to the British
government? Absent any Crown and operating in a culture that puts a high
premium on

individualism, American courts have tended to reject any
special rule for treasure trove and generally treat buried treasure like any
other kind of lost or

abandoned property.

5 .American courts sometimes distinguish between lost and
mislaid property in deciding who gets to keep a found object. See, e.g., McAvoy
v.

Medina, 93 Mass. 548 ( 1866 ). An object is said to be
mislaid when the owner intentionally places it somewhere and then forgets it
(for example, the

owner places it on a counter in a store and then leaves
without it). An object is said to be lost when the owner is unaware of losing
possession of it (for

example, it falls out of the owner’s pocket). Courts that
observe the distinction generally award lost property to the finder, and
mislaid property to the

owner of the land where it is found. Does this distinction
make sense? What policy or objective is being pursued by further subdividing
the world of

misplaced objects in this fashion? Was the brooch in
_Hannah_ lost or mislaid?

CONCLUDING NOTE AND QUESTIONS

The idea of possession appears repeatedly in all the
material we have covered in this chapter. First possession, obviously, is based
on being the first

to possess an unclaimed thing. Discovery is based on being
the first to discover some thing, and hence having a unique claim to possess
it. Creation

involves being the first to possess some new or novel thing.
Accession is more complicated, but in many of its applications appears to
involve the

perception that one thing bears such a prominent
relationship to another thing that possession of the one thing is also
possession of the other thing. And

of course adverse possession is based on someone possessing
a thing for such a long period of time that the rights of the original owner
are extinguished.

Moreover, the sequential possession issues seem to suggest
that prior possession is privileged in the law, and the cases about competing
acquisition

principles can be read as turning on which of two rival
claims of possession the court finds more compelling in any given context. Does
all this suggest

that there is only one principle of original acquisition,
based on having a stronger claim of possession? Why should possession play such
a pivotal role

in assigning ownership to things? Can you think of some
other principle, unrelated to possession, that might serve as an alternative
basis for establishing

original claims to ownership of things?

Records release of an album containing seven tracks produced
from the master recordings. The exact date of the Rhino Records licensing deal
is not clear in the record but necessarily

occurred in or before 1991. Thus, with 1991 as the date of
conversion, Songbyrd’s claim was time barred prior to the commencement of this
action in 1995.

## CHAPTER III

# VALUES SUBJECT TO OWNERSHIP

What sorts of resources are eligible for claims of property
rights? Clearly not every valued thing is or should be property. Human slavery

was a system in which one human being claimed ownership of
another. A Civil War was fought over this issue, and led to the adoption of the

Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished all forms of slavery
and involuntary servitude. This gives us one fixed point of reference as to
what

cannot be included in the system of property rights. Selling
babies is also forbidden, although some economists have argued that this policy

should be reconsidered. Other resources are thought to
belong to the public at large—highways and waterways, and in the more
intangible realm,

ideas and perhaps the law itself. How do we determine the
proper domain of the system of property rights? We start by considering several

controversies about interests that may be thought to be too
personal or private to be subject to private property rights—human bodies, body
parts

and fluids, and individuals’ unique personality. We then
consider certain academic perspectives that inform debates about the proper
scope of the

system of property rights. This is followed by a
consideration of interests that are interwoven in a regime of custom and their
relation to law. We

then turn to interests that may be thought to be too public
to be subject to private property rights—like harbors and beaches. We end with

resources that seem to call for some mixture of public and
private rights and focus on one prominent such resource—water.

### A. PERSONHOOD

One issue that confronts any system of property rights is
whether there are certain interests that are inappropriate for treatment as
property

because they are too closely connected to personhood. There
is a universal consensus today that people are not a permissible subject of
property

rights. Not only is formal slavery abolished, but the
Supreme Court has long invalidated schemes that would permit peonage—systems of

servitude based on unpaid debts. See, e.g., Bailey v.
Alabama, 219 U.S. 219 (1911). The usual justification for this understanding is
that people,

as autonomous moral agents, should not be regarded as
objects or commodities to be bought and sold by other people. But how far does
this anti-

commodification principle extend? As the cases in this
section clearly reveal, modern medical technology is rapidly generating
controversial

questions about the boundary between persons and property.
There is every reason to believe that these issues will multiply and become
ever

more vexing in the near future. As things presently

#210

stand, the law is deeply ambivalent about whether to apply
the “property” template in resolving these issues. Controversy also exists
about

whether it should be possible to claim as property an
individual’s unique personality or persona.

Supreme Court of California, In Bank, 1990.



793 P. 2 d 479.



```

I.INTRODUCTION

■
PANELLI, JUSTICE. We granted review in this case to determine whether plaintiff
has stated a cause of action against his physician and other

defendants for using his cells in potentially lucrative
medical research without his permission. Plaintiff alleges that his physician
failed to

disclose preexisting research and economic interests in the
cells before obtaining consent to the medical procedures by which they were

extracted. The superior court sustained all defendants’
demurrers to the third amended complaint, and the Court of Appeal reversed. We
hold that

the complaint states a cause of action for breach of the
physician’s disclosure obligations, but not for conversion.

II.FACTS

[According to the complaint, John Moore, who lived in
Seattle, was diagnosed as having hairy-cell leukemia. He traveled to Los
Angeles to

be treated by Dr. David Golde at the UCLA Medical Center.
Golde recommended that Moore’s spleen be removed in order to slow down the

progress of the disease. Moore signed a written consent form
authorizing the operation. Without informing Moore, Dr. Golde and his
associates

also developed plans to do research on certain white blood
cells called T-lymphocytes taken from Moore’s spleen. The objective was to
produce

certain lymphokines, or proteins that regulate the immune
system. The genetic code for making these lymphokines is identical in all
persons, but

it is hard to locate the particular genes responsible for
making each lymphokine. Because of his disease, the cells in Moore’s spleen had

overproduced certain lymphokines, making the process of
identification easier.

In order to pursue this research, Dr. Golde and his
associates established a new cell line from Moore’s T-lymphocytes. They then
sought on

behalf of themselves and UCLA a patent on the new cell line.
The patent was granted, and Golde negotiated a contract with Genetics
Institute,

Inc., granting the firm exclusive access to the materials
and research based on the cell line, in return for $440,000 to be paid to Golde
and the

Regents over three years, as well as a consultant position
and rights to shares of common stock for Golde. It was estimated that the

#211

total potential market for products based on lymphokines
might eventually reach $3 billion per year.

When Moore learned the use to which his spleen cells had
been put, he sued Dr. Golde, his associates, and UCLA. His complaint asserted a

number of causes of action including conversion—the taking
of property from someone without their consent and converting it to the use of
the

defendant. He also asserted a number of other causes of
action, including lack of informed consent and unjust enrichment. The trial
court held

that the action for conversion could not be maintained
because Moore had no property right in his spleen cells after they had been
removed from

his body, and that this defect meant that all the other
asserted causes of action failed too. Moore appealed.]

III.DISCUSSION

A.Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Lack of Informed Consent

Moore repeatedly alleges that Golde failed to disclose the
extent of his research and economic interests in Moore’s cells before obtaining

consent to the medical procedures by which the cells were
extracted. These allegations, in our view, state a cause of action against
Golde for

invading a legally protected interest of his patient. This
cause of action can properly be characterized either as the breach of a
fiduciary duty to

disclose facts material to the patient’s consent or,
alternatively, as the performance of medical procedures without first having
obtained the

patient’s informed consent. * * *

Accordingly, we hold that a physician who is seeking a
patient’s consent for a medical procedure must, in order to satisfy his
fiduciary duty

and to obtain the patient’s informed consent, disclose
personal interests unrelated to the patient’s health, whether research or
economic, that may

affect his medical judgment. * * *

B.Conversion

Moore also attempts to characterize the invasion of his
rights as a conversion—a tort that protects against interference with
possessory and

ownership interests in personal property. He theorizes that
he continued to own his cells following their removal from his body, at least
for the

purpose of directing their use, and that he never consented
to their use in potentially lucrative medical research. Thus, to complete
Moore’s

argument, defendants’ unauthorized use of his cells
constitutes a conversion. As a result of the alleged conversion, Moore claims a
proprietary

interest in each of the products that any of the defendants
might ever create from his cells or the patented cell line.

No court, however, has ever in a reported decision imposed
conversion liability for the use of human cells in medical research. While that

fact does not end our inquiry, it raises a flag of caution.
In effect, what Moore is asking us to do is to impose a tort duty on scientists
to

investigate the consensual pedigree of each human cell
sample used in research. To impose such a duty, which would affect medical
research of

#212

importance to all of society, implicates policy concerns far
removed from the traditional, two-party ownership disputes in which the law of

conversion arose. Invoking a tort theory originally used to
determine whether the loser or the finder of a horse had the better title,
Moore claims

ownership of the results of socially important medical
research, including the genetic code for chemicals that regulate the functions
of every

human being’s immune system.

We have recognized that, when the proposed application of a
very general theory of liability in a new context raises important policy

concerns, it is especially important to face those concerns
and address them openly. * * * Moreover, we should be hesitant to “impose [new
tort

duties] when to do so would involve complex policy
decisions” (Nally v. Grace Community Church, 763 P.2d 948, 960 (Cal. 1988)),
especially

when such decisions are more appropriately the subject of
legislative deliberation and resolution. * * *

1.Moore’s Claim Under Existing Law

“To establish a conversion, plaintiff must establish an
actual interference with his ownership or right of possession.... Where
plaintiff

neither has title to the property alleged to have been
converted, nor possession thereof, he cannot maintain an action for
conversion.” (Del E.

Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co., 176 Cal. Rptr. 824,
833 (Cal. Ct. App. 1981), emphasis added.) * * *

Since Moore clearly did not expect to retain possession of
his cells following their removal, to sue for their conversion he must have

retained an ownership interest in them. But there are
several reasons to doubt that he did retain any such interest. * * *

Neither the Court of Appeal’s opinion, the parties’ briefs,
nor our research discloses a case holding that a person retains a sufficient
interest

in excised cells to support a cause of action for
conversion. We do not find this surprising, since the laws governing such
things as human tissues,

transplantable organs,^22 blood,^23 fetuses, pituitary
glands, corneal tissue,^26 and dead bodies deal with human biological materials
as objects sui

generis, regulating their disposition to achieve policy
goals

#213

rather than abandoning them to the general law of personal
property. It is these specialized statutes, not the law of conversion, to which
courts

ordinarily should and do look for guidance on the
disposition of human biological materials.

Lacking direct authority for importing the law of conversion
into this context, Moore relies, as did the Court of Appeal, primarily on

decisions addressing privacy rights. One line of cases
involves unwanted publicity. (Lugosi v. Universal Pictures, 603 P.2d 425 (Cal.
1979);

Motschenbacher v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, 498 F.2d
821 (9th Cir. 1974) [interpreting Cal. law].) These opinions hold that every
person

has a proprietary interest in his own likeness and that
unauthorized, business use of a likeness is redressible as a tort. But in
neither opinion did

the authoring court expressly base its holding on property
law. Each court stated, following Prosser, that it was “pointless” to debate
the proper

characterization of the proprietary interest in a likeness.
For purposes of determining whether the tort of conversion lies, however, the

characterization of the right in question is far from
pointless. Only property can be converted.

Not only are the wrongful-publicity cases irrelevant to the
issue of conversion, but the analogy to them seriously misconceives the nature
of

the genetic materials and research involved in this case. *

* * [A]s the defendants’ patent makes clear—and the complaint, too, if read
    with an

understanding of the scientific terms which it has borrowed
from the patent—the goal and result of defendants’ efforts has been to
manufacture

lymphokines. Lymphokines, unlike a name or a face, have the
same molecular structure in every human being and the same, important functions

in every human being’s immune system. Moreover, the
particular genetic material which is responsible for the natural production of

lymphokines, and which defendants use to manufacture
lymphokines in the laboratory, is also the same in every person; it is no more
unique to

Moore than the number of vertebrae in the spine or the
chemical formula of hemoglobin. * * *

* * * [T]he Court of Appeal in this case concluded that “[a]
      patient must have the ultimate power to control what becomes of his or her

tissues. To hold otherwise would open the door to a massive
invasion of human privacy and dignity in the name of medical progress.” Yet one

may earnestly wish to protect privacy and dignity without
accepting the extremely problematic conclusion that interference with those
interests

amounts to a conversion of personal property. Nor is it
necessary to force the round pegs of “privacy” and “dignity” into the square
hole of

“property” in order to protect the patient, since the
fiduciary-duty and informed-consent theories protect these interests directly
by requiring full

disclosure.

The next consideration that makes Moore’s claim of ownership
problematic is California statutory law, which drastically limits a patient’s

control over excised cells. Pursuant to Health and Safety
Code

#214

section 7054.4, “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of
law, recognizable anatomical parts, human tissues, anatomical human remains, or

infectious waste following conclusion of scientific use
shall be disposed of by interment, incineration, or any other method determined
by the

state department [of health services] to protect the public
health and safety.” Clearly the Legislature did not specifically intend this
statute to

resolve the question of whether a patient is entitled to
compensation for the nonconsensual use of excised cells. A primary object of
the statute is

to ensure the safe handling of potentially hazardous
biological waste materials. Yet one cannot escape the conclusion that the
statute’s practical

effect is to limit, drastically, a patient’s control over
excised cells. By restricting how excised cells may be used and requiring their
eventual

destruction, the statute eliminates so many of the rights
ordinarily attached to property that one cannot simply assume that what is left
amounts to

“property” or “ownership” for purposes of conversion law.

It may be that some limited right to control the use of
excised cells does survive the operation of this statute. There is, for
example, no need

to read the statute to permit “scientific use” contrary to
the patient’s expressed wish. A fully informed patient may always withhold
consent to

treatment by a physician whose research plans the patient
does not approve. That right, however, as already discussed, is protected by
the

fiduciary-duty and informed-consent theories.

Finally, the subject matter of the Regents’ patent—the
patented cell line and the products derived from it—cannot be Moore’s property.
This

is because the patented cell line is both factually and
legally distinct from the cells taken from Moore’s body. Federal law permits
the patenting of

organisms that represent the product of “human ingenuity,”
but not naturally occurring organisms. (Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303,
309–

310 (1980).) Human cell lines are patentable because
“[l]ong-term adaptation and growth of human tissues and cells in culture is
difficult—often

considered an art.. .,” and the probability of success is
low. (U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, New Developments in

Biotechnology: Ownership of Human Tissues and Cells (1987)
at p. 33 (hereafter OTA Report).) It is this inventive effort that patent law
rewards,

not the discovery of naturally occurring raw materials.
Thus, Moore’s allegations that he owns the cell line and the products derived
from it are

inconsistent with the patent, which constitutes an
authoritative determination that the cell line is the product of invention. * *
*

2.Should Conversion Liability Be Extended?

* * * Of the relevant policy considerations, two are of
      overriding importance. The first is protection of a competent patient’s right
      to make

autonomous medical decisions. That right, as already
discussed, is grounded in well-recognized and long-standing principles of
fiduciary duty

and informed consent. This policy weighs in favor of
providing a

#215

remedy to patients when physicians act with undisclosed
motives that may affect their professional judgment. The second important
policy

consideration is that we not threaten with disabling civil
liability innocent parties who are engaged in socially useful activities, such
as

researchers who have no reason to believe that their use of
a particular cell sample is, or may be, against a donor’s wishes. * * *

[A]n examination of the relevant policy considerations
suggests an appropriate balance: Liability based upon existing disclosure

obligations, rather than an unprecedented extension of the
conversion theory, protects patients’ rights of privacy and autonomy without

unnecessarily hindering research.

To be sure, the threat of liability for conversion might
help to enforce patients’ rights indirectly. This is because physicians might
be able to

avoid liability by obtaining patients’ consent, in the
broadest possible terms, to any conceivable subsequent research use of excised
cells.

Unfortunately, to extend the conversion theory would utterly
sacrifice the other goal of protecting innocent parties. Since conversion is a
strict

liability tort,^38 it would impose liability on all those
into whose hands the cells come, whether or not the particular defendant
participated in, or

knew of, the inadequate disclosures that violated the
patient’s right to make an informed decision. In contrast to the conversion
theory, the

fiduciary-duty and informed-consent theories protect the
patient directly, without punishing innocent parties or creating disincentives
to the

conduct of socially beneficial research. * * *

[T]he theory of liability that Moore urges us to endorse
threatens to destroy the economic incentive to conduct important medical
research.

If the use of cells in research is a conversion, then with
every cell sample a researcher purchases a ticket in a litigation lottery.
Because liability

for conversion is predicated on a continuing ownership
interest, “companies are unlikely to invest heavily in developing,
manufacturing, or

marketing a product when uncertainty about clear title
exists.” (OTA Rep., supra, at p. 27.) * * *^42

#216

* * * If the scientific users of human cells are to be held
      liable for failing to investigate the consensual pedigree of their raw
      materials, we

believe the Legislature should make that decision. Complex
policy choices affecting all society are involved, and “[l]egislatures, in
making such

policy decisions, have the ability to gather empirical
evidence, solicit the advice of experts, and hold hearings at which all
interested parties

present evidence and express their views... .” (Foley v.
Interactive Data Corp., 765 P.2d 373, 397, fn. 31 (Cal. 1988).) * * *

Finally, there is no pressing need to impose a judicially
created rule of strict liability, since enforcement of physicians’ disclosure

obligations will protect patients against the very type of
harm with which Moore was threatened. So long as a physician discloses research
and

economic interests that may affect his judgment, the patient
is protected from conflicts of interest. Aware of any conflicts, the patient
can make

an informed decision to consent to treatment, or to withhold
consent and look elsewhere for medical assistance. As already discussed,

enforcement of physicians’ disclosure obligations protects
patients directly, without hindering the socially useful activities of innocent

researchers.

For these reasons, we hold that the allegations of Moore’s
third amended complaint state a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty or

lack of informed consent, but not conversion. * * *

■
ARABIAN, JUSTICE, concurring. I join in the views cogently expounded by the
majority. I write separately to give voice to a concern that I

believe informs much of that opinion but finds little or no
expression therein. I speak of the moral issue.

Plaintiff has asked us to recognize and enforce a right to
sell one’s own body tissue for profit. He entreats us to regard the human
vessel—

the single most venerated and protected subject in any
civilized society—as equal with the basest commercial commodity. He urges us to

commingle the sacred with the profane. He asks much. * * *

It is true, that this court has not often been deterred from
deciding difficult legal issues simply because they require a choice between

competing social or economic policies. The difference here,
however, lies in the nature of the conflicting moral, philosophical and even
religious

values at stake, and in the profound implications of the
position urged. The ramifications of recognizing and enforcing a property
interest in body

tissues are not known, but are greatly feared—the effect on
human dignity of a marketplace in human body parts, the impact on research and

development of competitive bidding for such materials, and
the exposure of researchers to potentially limitless and uncharted tort
liability.

Whether, as plaintiff urges, his cells should be treated as
property susceptible to conversion is not, in my view, ours to decide. The
question

implicates choices which not only reflect, but which
ultimately define our essence. A mark of wisdom for us as expositors of the law
is the

#217

recognition that we cannot cure every ill, mediate every
dispute, resolve every conundrum. Sometimes, as Justice Brandeis said, “the
most

important thing we do, is not doing.”^1

Where then shall a complete resolution be found? Clearly the
Legislature, as the majority opinion suggests, is the proper deliberative
forum.

Indeed, a legislative response creating a licensing scheme,
which establishes a fixed rate of profit sharing between researcher and
subject, has

already been suggested. Such an arrangement would not only
avoid the moral and philosophical objections to a free market operation in body

tissue, but would also address stated concerns by
eliminating the inherently coercive effect of a waiver system and by
compensating donors

regardless of temporal circumstances. * * *

■
BROUSSARD, JUSTICE, concurring and dissenting [omitted]. * * *

■ MOSK,
JUSTICE, dissenting. * * *

The concepts of property and ownership in our law are
extremely broad. (See Civ. Code, §§ 654, 655.) A leading decision of this court

approved the following definition: “ ‘The term “property” is
sufficiently comprehensive to include every species of estate, real and
personal, and

everything which one person can own and transfer to another.
It extends to every species of right and interest capable of being enjoyed as
such

upon which it is practicable to place a money value.’ ”
(Yuba River Power Co. v. Nevada Irr. Dist., 279 P. 128, 129 (Cal. 1929).)

Being broad, the concept of property is also abstract:
rather than referring directly to a material object such as a parcel of land or
the tractor

that cultivates it, the concept of property is often said to
refer to a “bundle of rights” that may be exercised with respect to that
object—

principally the rights to possess the property, to use the
property, to exclude others from the property, and to dispose of the property
by sale or by

gift. “Ownership is not a single concrete entity but a
bundle of rights and privileges as well as of obligations.” (Union Oil Co. v.
State Bd. of

Equal., 386 P.2d 496, 500 (Cal. 1963).) But the same bundle
of rights does not attach to all forms of property. For a variety of policy
reasons, the

law limits or even forbids the exercise of certain rights
over certain forms of property. For example, both law and contract may limit
the right of

an owner of real property to use his parcel as he sees fit.
Owners of various forms of personal property may likewise be subject to
restrictions on

the time, place, and manner of their use. Limitations on the
disposition of real property, while less common, may also be imposed. Finally,
some

types of personal property may be sold but not given away,^9
while others

#218

may be given away but not sold,^10 and still others may
neither be given away nor sold.^11

In each of the foregoing instances, the limitation or
prohibition diminishes the bundle of rights that would otherwise attach to the
property,

yet what remains is still deemed in law to be a protectible
property interest. “Since property or title is a complex bundle of rights,
duties, powers

and immunities, the pruning away of some or a great many of
these elements does not entirely destroy the title... .” (People v. Walker, 90
P.2d

854, 855 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1939) [even the possessor of
contraband has certain property rights in it against anyone other than the
state].) The

same rule applies to Moore’s interest in his own body
tissue: even if we assume that section 7054.4 limited the use and disposition
of his excised

tissue in the manner claimed by the majority, Moore
nevertheless retained valuable rights in that tissue. Above all, at the time of
its excision he at

least had the right to do with his own tissue whatever the
defendants did with it: i.e., he could have contracted with researchers and

pharmaceutical companies to develop and exploit the vast
commercial potential of his tissue and its products. Defendants certainly
believe that

their right to do the foregoing is not barred by section
7054.4 and is a significant property right, as they have demonstrated by their
deliberate

concealment from Moore of the true value of his tissue,
their efforts to obtain a patent on the Mo cell line, their contractual
agreements to exploit

this material, their exclusion of Moore from any
participation in the profits, and their vigorous defense of this lawsuit. The
Court of Appeal

summed up the point by observing that “Defendants’ position
that plaintiff cannot own his tissue, but that they can, is fraught with
irony.” It is

also legally untenable. As noted above, the majority cite no
case holding that an individual’s right to develop and exploit the commercial

potential of his own tissue is not a right of sufficient
worth or dignity to be deemed a protectible property interest. In the absence
of such

authority—or of legislation to the same effect—the right
falls within the traditionally broad concept of property in our law. * * *

[O]ur society acknowledges a profound ethical imperative to
respect the human body as the physical and temporal expression of the unique

human persona. One manifestation of that respect is our
prohibition against direct abuse of the body by torture or other forms of cruel
or unusual

punishment. Another is our prohibition against indirect
abuse of the body by its economic exploitation for the sole benefit of another
person. The

most abhorrent form of such exploitation, of course, was the
institution of slavery. Lesser forms, such as indentured servitude or even
debtor’s

prison, have also disappeared. Yet their specter haunts the

#219

laboratories and boardrooms of today’s biotechnological
research-industrial complex. It arises wherever scientists or industrialists
claim, as

defendants claim here, the right to appropriate and exploit
a patient’s tissue for their sole economic benefit—the right, in other words,
to freely

mine or harvest valuable physical properties of the
patient’s body: “Research with human cells that results in significant economic
gain for the

researcher and no gain for the patient offends the
traditional mores of our society in a manner impossible to quantify. Such
research tends to treat

the human body as a commodity—a means to a profitable end.
The dignity and sanctity with which we regard the human whole, body as well as

mind and soul, are absent when we allow researchers to
further their own interests without the patient’s participation by using a
patient’s cells as

the basis for a marketable product.” (Danforth, Cells,
Sales, and Royalties: The Patient’s Right to a Portion of the Profits, 6 Yale
L. & Pol’y Rev.

179, 190 (1988).)

A second policy consideration adds notions of equity to
those of ethics. Our society values fundamental fairness in dealings between
its

members, and condemns the unjust enrichment of any member at
the expense of another. This is particularly true when, as here, the parties
are

not in equal bargaining positions. * * *

There will be * * * equitable sharing if the courts
recognize that the patient has a legally protected property interest in his own
body and its

products: “property rights in one’s own tissue would provide
a morally acceptable result by giving effect to notions of fairness and
preventing

unjust enrichment.... [¶] Societal notions of equity and
fairness demand recognition of property rights. There are bountiful benefits,
monetary

and otherwise, to be derived from human biologics. To deny
the person contributing the raw material a fair share of these ample benefits
is both

unfair and morally wrong.” (Note, Toward the Right of
Commerciality: Recognizing Property Rights in the Commercial Value of Human
Tissue,

34 UCLA L. Rev. 207, 229 (1986).) * * *

The inference I draw from the current statutory regulation
of human biological materials, moreover, is the opposite of that drawn by the

majority. By selective quotation of the statutes the
majority seem to suggest that human organs and blood cannot legally be sold on
the open

market—thereby implying that if the Legislature were to act
here it would impose a similar ban on monetary compensation for the use of
human

tissue in biotechnological research and development. But if
that is the argument, the premise is unsound: contrary to popular
misconception, it is

not true that human organs and blood cannot legally be sold.

As to organs, the majority rely on the Uniform Anatomical
Gift Act (Health & Saf.Code, § 7150 et seq., hereafter the UAGA) for the

proposition that a competent adult may make a post mortem
gift of any part of his body but may not receive “valuable consideration” for
the

transfer. But the prohibition of the UAGA against the sale
of a body part

#220

is much more limited than the majority recognize: by its
terms (Health & Saf.Code, § 7155, subd. (a)) the prohibition applies only
to sales for

“transplantation” or “therapy.” Yet a different section of
the UAGA authorizes the transfer and receipt of body parts for such additional
purposes

as “medical or dental education, research, or advancement of
medical or dental science.” (Health & Saf.Code, § 7153, subd. (a)(1).) No
section

of the UAGA prohibits anyone from selling body parts for any
of those additional purposes; by clear implication, therefore, such sales are

legal.^23 Indeed, the fact that the UAGA prohibits no sales
of organs other than sales for “transportation” or “therapy” raises a further
implication

that it is also legal for anyone to sell human tissue to a
biotechnology company for research and development purposes. * * *

It follows that the statutes regulating the transfers of
human organs and blood do not support the majority’s refusal to recognize a

conversion cause of action for commercial exploitation of
human blood cells without consent. On the contrary, because such statutes treat
both

organs and blood as property that can legally be sold in a
variety of circumstances, they impliedly support Moore’s contention that his
blood cells

are likewise property for which he can and should receive
compensation, and hence are protected by the law of conversion. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .What is the holding of this case? That body parts and
fluids removed from a person’s body are not property? That body parts and
fluids removed

from a person’s body may not be sold in a commercial
transaction, and hence cannot provide the foundation for an action for damages
based on

conversion? That medical researchers have a public-policy
based immunity from liability for conversion when taking body parts and fluids
from a

person without their consent?

2 .Does the California Supreme Court’s decision in fact deny
persons compensation for taking their body parts or fluids? A fully informed
patient

could condition the doctors’ right to perform the operation
on sharing the fruits of the spleen cells with him. If the UCLA doctors refuse,
could Moore

shop his proposal to USC and other hospitals? Or should this
be illegal? If so, why? Does the right to refuse consent mean that a patient
has some right

to determine the use of the severed body part? Would that
make it property?

3 .Why hasn’t Moore abandoned any interest in his spleen
cells? If you go to a salon to get a haircut, isn’t the usual assumption that
you have

abandoned your hair cuttings, and the salon can dispose of
them as it sees fit? What happens if you learn later that your hair is
commercially valuable?

#221

Consider the threat by Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk
on the moon, to sue his barber for gathering some of Armstrong’s hair off the
shop floor

and selling it for $ 3 , 000. (In case you’re wondering, the
buyer was a Connecticut collector listed by Guinness World Records as having
the world’s

largest collection of celebrity hair.) Terry Kinney, Neil
Armstrong Threatens To Sue Barber Who Sold Hair, Akron Beacon J., June 1 , 2005
, at B 1. Or is

hair less personal than other body parts? Incidentally, if
Armstrong claimed a violation of his right of publicity (see infra Part A. 2 ),
how would he likely

fare? How should he?

4 .One concern motivating both the majority opinion and some
of the dissents relates to the in rem aspect of property. If Moore has property
in his

cells and can sue for conversion, the set of duty bearers is
not limited to the doctors who operated on him (as it is with fiduciary
duties). This is

beneficial to Moore, but it puts scientists at risk of
violating rights about which they may have difficulty investigating. Would a
registry of cell lines with

provenances help here? What about existing cell lines?

5 .The concern about imposing liability for conversion on
remote researchers is made vivid by the story of Henrietta Lacks, as recounted
in

Rebecca Skloot, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks ( 2010
). Lacks was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1951 , and cancer cells taken
from her body

by physicians at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore
eventually became an “immortal” cell line known as HeLa cells. Today, it is
believed that

scientists have grown 20 tons of cells from the HeLa line,
which has been used in research generating some 11 , 000 patents. Lacks died
shortly after her

cells were removed, almost certainly without being informed
of the removal. Her family had no clue that her cells had become an important
tool of

scientific research until many decades later. If her cells
were private property (contrary to _Moore_ ), would any claim by her
descendants for conversion

now be barred by adverse possession? Or would the clock not
start running until they knew or should have known that the cells were taken,
or until they

had made a demand for their return (see Chapter II supra)?

6 .As the majority points out, patent law is clear about who
is and is not a joint inventor and hence the initial owner of a patent. But the
patenting

of living organisms has been controversial. Section 101 of
the Patent Act, echoing language of Thomas Jefferson in the 1793 Patent Act,
provides that

“[w]hoever invents or discovers any new and useful process,
machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful
improvement

thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the
conditions and requirements of this title.” 35 U.S.C. § 101. In the case of
_Diamond v. Chakrabarty_ ,

447 U.S. 303 , 309 ( 1980 ), mentioned in the _Moore_
opinion, the Supreme Court held that patentable subject matter “include[s]
everything under the sun

that is made by man,” a phrase used by the drafters in the
legislative history of the 1952 Act. Ideas and laws of nature are still not
patentable subject

matter, see Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593 , 603 , 610 – 11
( 2010 ), but this exception has fluctuated in scope over time. To be
patentable, a living organism

should be altered from any naturally existing form; merely
being distilled in a way not occurring in nature is not enough, Association for

```



222



```

Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, 569 U.S. 576 ( 2013
). Does this exhaust concerns one might have? How if at all is patenting a gene
sequence

different from patenting a life-saving pharmaceutical?

7 .How would Moore fare under the law of accession (see
Chapter II.D)? Could one say that the good doctors combined their labor with
Moore’s

spleen cells to create a new asset? But didn’t they do so in
“bad faith”? Should the court have considered whether Moore was entitled to an
award of

restitution? Could the court have awarded restitution
without determining that Moore had a property right in his spleen cells?

Body Parts After Moore

Subsequent decisions applying California law have tended to
read Moore narrowly. In one decision, Hecht v. Superior Court , 20 Cal. Rptr.

2d 27 5, 283 (Cal. Ct. App. 1993), the court held that
frozen sperm cells left in a commercial cryogenic laboratory by a man who
committed

suicide were subject to the jurisdiction and control of the
probate court. The decedent’s children wanted the sperm destroyed; his
girlfriend

wanted to take custody of the sperm for possible future use
in bearing a child with the decedent’s genetic material. The court clearly
perceived

that some orderly basis for resolving the dispute was
required, which meant giving the probate court jurisdiction over the sperm
cells. Under

California law, however, the power of the probate court
extends only to the “property” of a deceased person. So the sperm cells were
deemed to

be property, at least for these purposes. The court
distinguished Moore on the ground that it did not involve “gametic” material
that can be used

for human reproduction, something in which persons from whom
the material is taken have a particularly strong interest. Does the decision
mean

that if Moore had died during the operation, and his heirs
had sued to recover the spleen cells, the dispute would have been subject to
the

jurisdiction of the probate court? Does this mean body parts
must be regarded as “property” at least for these purposes? See also In re
Estate of

Kievernagel, 83 Cal.Rptr.3d 311 (Cal. Ct. App. 2008) (proper
disposition of gametic material depends on intent of donor); Yearworth v. North

Bristol NHS Trust, [2009] EWCA (Civ) 37 (appeal taken from
Eng.) (English Court of Appeal decision concluding that gametic material is

common law property).

In another decision, Newman v. Sathyavaglswaran , 287 F.3d
786 (9th Cir. 2002), the court was confronted with a constitutional challenge
to

a California statute that allowed coroners to remove corneas
from bodies being autopsied, in order to make them available to persons who
need

corneal transplants. Parents whose deceased children had had
their corneas removed without parental notice sued, claiming they had been

deprived of property without due process of law. The court
agreed that the parents had a property right in their deceased children’s
bodies, and

hence in corneas taken from their bodies, sufficient to
trigger due process protection. It reasoned from California and common law
authorities

that

#223

impose a duty on the next of kin to make arrangements for
the burial or other disposal of human bodies (with an accompanying
“quasi-property”

right of the next of kin in the body of the deceased). Moore
was not mentioned. Does the decision mean that if Moore had died during the

operation and the doctors had then taken his spleen cells
for research purposes, Moore’s relatives could have sued the doctors for a
“taking” of

their property? Does it make sense that body parts and
fluids removed from a dead body are property, but those removed from a live
body are

not?

Whether Newman will be followed in the future is unclear. In
Conroy v. Regents of the University of California , 203 P.3d 1127 (Cal. 2009),

the California Supreme Court rejected the claim that
institutions receiving bodies through donations have a duty to dispose of the
remains in a

manner that would not shock the sensibilities of family
members. A lower court decision involving a coroner’s disposal of body parts
which had

disagreed with Newman was vacated and remanded for further
consideration in light of this decision. See Perryman v. County of Los Angeles,
63

Cal. Rptr. 3d 732 (Cal. Ct. App. 2007), vacated, 208 P.3d
622 (Cal. 2009). More broadly, courts have generally rejected claims based on
alleged

mishandling of dead bodies by the government, concluding
that the next of kin have insufficient property rights in the body of the
deceased to

support such actions. See, e.g., Albrecht v. Treon, 889
N.E.2d 120, 129 (Ohio 2008); Evanston Ins. Co. v. Legacy of life, Inc., 370
S.W. 3d 377,

385 (Tex. 2012) (noting that “next of kin have no right to
exclude, other than to seek damages in certain circumstances for acts done
beyond their

consent”); Shelley v. San Joaquin, 996 F. Supp. 2d 921 (E.D.
Cal. 2014) (applying California law and relying in part on Moore ).

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .In light of these further precedents, how would you
characterize the status of the _Moore_ decision today? Is it tenable to say
that body parts and

fluids removed from a person’s body are “not property”?

2 .Another source of controversy, analogous to the dispute
in _Hecht_ over frozen sperm, concerns frozen embryos. In _Davis v. Davis_ ,
842 S.W. 2 d

588 (Tenn. 1992 ), a married couple attempting to have
children using in vitro fertilization techniques produced a number of
fertilized embryos which

were then cryogenically frozen. Before the embryos were
implanted, the couple divorced. The wife remarried, but the parties could not
agree on the

disposition of the frozen embryos. The wife wanted them
donated for use by childless couples; the husband wanted them destroyed. The
Tennessee

Supreme Court, after balancing the interests of the parties,
ruled for the husband. Would the same result follow if the wife wanted the
embryos to

attempt a pregnancy herself? Might a husband in a bitter
divorce wish to see frozen embryos destroyed knowing that this would be the
wife’s last chance

(but not his) to be a biological parent? If there is any
theme in the embryo cases, it is that either party can back out and veto the
use of the embryos at

any time before implantation. Is this equality? In light of
all this, is the

```



224



```

embryo property? What if both biological contributors agree
to sell the frozen embryos? For an overview of the extensive literature, see
Shirley Darby

Howell, The Frozen Embryo: Scholarly Theories, Case Law, and
Proposed State Regulation, 14 DePaul J. Health Care L. 407 ( 2013 ).

3 .James E. Penner, whom we encountered in Chapter I, has
also advanced what he calls the “separation thesis”: Only items that are
thought of as

separate from their owners can be “things” and hence objects
of property—the right to a thing. Thus, if someone cuts a lock of your hair
while you are

sleeping, this would be a violation of your person—a
battery. But if someone took a lock of your hair after you had cut it off, this
would be a theft. Does

this accord with the treatment in the decided cases
involving body parts and fluids? With your intuitions? See J.E. Penner, The
Idea of Property in Law

111 – 27 ( 1997 ). Consider the case of _R. v. Bentham_ , [
2005 ] UKHL 18 , in which the House of Lords overturned a conviction for
possessing an imitation

firearm in the course of a robbery, where the defendant had
used his hand to puff out a zipped up jacket to give the impression of a gun.
Relying on the

premise that “[o]ne cannot possess something which is not
separate and distinct from oneself,” the court found that, although the
defendant’s behavior

was “reprehensible” (and subject to other criminal
liability), the defendant’s unsevered finger or hand could not be “possessed.”
Does this make sense?

■
KLEINFELD, SENIOR CIRCUIT JUDGE: * * * The complaint challenges the
constitutionality of the ban on compensation for human organs in the

National Organ Transplant Act [ 42 U.S.C. § 274e], as
applied to bone marrow transplants. * * * [Plaintiffs include parents of sick
children,

physicians, and parents of mixed race children and African
Americans for whom no perfect blood marrow matches have been donated.
Plaintiffs

also include] a California nonprofit corporation that seeks
to operate a program incentivizing bone marrow donations. The corporation
proposes

to offer $3,000 awards in the form of scholarships, housing
allowances, or gifts to charities selected by donors, initially to minority and
mixed

race donors of bone marrow cells, who are likely to have the
rarest marrow type. The corporation, MoreMarrowDonors.org, alleges that it
cannot

launch this program because the National Organ Transplant
Act criminalizes payment of compensation for organs, and classifies bone marrow
as

an organ.

We generally use the word “marrow” to refer to the soft,
fatty material in the central cavities of big bones, what some people suck out
of

beef bones. Bone marrow is the body’s blood manufacturing
factory. Bone marrow transplants enable sick patients, whose own blood cells

to be killed to save their lives, to produce new blood
cells. For example, patients with leukemia, which is cancer of the blood or
bone

#225

marrow, may need chemotherapy or radiation to kill the
cancer cells in their blood. The treatments kill the white blood cells
essential to their

immune systems. The patients will die if the killed cells
are not quickly replaced with healthy cells. And they cannot be replaced
without the

stem cells, which we describe below, that can mature into
white blood cells. These stem cells can only be obtained through bone marrow

transplants.

Until about twenty years ago, bone marrow was extracted from
donors’ bones by “aspiration.” Long needles, thick enough to suck out the

soft, fatty marrow, were inserted into the cavities of the
anesthetized donor’s hip bones. These are large bones with big central cavities
full of

marrow. Aspiration is a painful, unpleasant procedure for
the donor. It requires hospitalization and general or local anesthesia, and
involves

commensurate risks.

The complaint explains that a new technology has superseded
this technique during the last twenty years, after enactment of the National

Organ Transplant Act. With this new technique, now used for
at least two thirds of bone marrow transplants, none of the soft, fatty marrow
is

actually donated. Patients who need bone marrow transplants
do not need everything that the soft, fatty substance from bone cavities
contains,

just some of the marrow’s “hematopoietic stem cells.” These
stem cells are seeds from which white blood cells, red blood cells, and
platelets

grow. These are not the embryonic stem cells often the
subject of controversy. Those stem cells, taken from human embryos, are
“pluripotent,”

that is, they can turn into any kind of cell—brain, blood,
retina, toenail, whatever. The stem cells at issue in this case are
“hematopoietic stem

cells.” “Hema” refers to blood, and “poietic” means
“pertaining to production.” Hematopoietic stem cells turn into blood cells and
nothing else.

Humans and other large mammals produce these blood stem
cells constantly in vast numbers, because our blood cells die within a few
months

and need continual replacement. The dead blood cells are
flushed out in the spleen, the body’s garbage disposal for used up blood cells,
and new

ones are made in the bone marrow, as long as we live.

Most blood stem cells stay in the bone marrow cavity and
grow into mature blood cells there, before passing into the blood vessels. But

some blood stem cells flow into and circulate in the
bloodstream before they mature. These are called “peripheral” blood stem cells,
“peripheral”

meaning outside the central area of the body. The new bone
marrow donation technique, developed during the past twenty years, is called

“peripheral blood stem cell apheresis.” “Apheresis” means
the removal or separation of something. This procedure begins with five days of

injections of a medication called a “granulocyte colony
stimulating factor” into the donor’s blood. The medication accelerates blood
stem cell

production in the marrow, so that more stem cells go into
the bloodstream. Then, with no need for sedatives or anesthesia, a needle is
inserted

into the donor’s vein. Blood is withdrawn from the vein and

#226

filtered through an apheresis machine to extract the blood
stem cells. The remaining components of the blood are returned to the donor’s
vein.

The blood stem cells extracted in the apheresis method are
replaced by the donor’s bone marrow in three to six weeks. Complications for
the

donor are exceedingly rare.

The main difference between an ordinary blood donation and
apheresis is that instead of just filling up a plastic bag with whole blood,
the

donor sits for some hours in a recliner while the blood
passes through the apheresis machine. This same apheresis technique is
sometimes used

for purposes other than bone marrow donations, such as when
the machine is set up to collect plasma or platelets, rather than stem cells,
from a

donor’s blood. When it is used for these other purposes, the
identical technique is called a “blood donation” or “blood plasma donation.”
When

used to separate out and collect hematopoietic stem cells
from the donor’s bloodstream, apheresis is called “peripheral blood stem cell
apheresis”

or a “bone marrow donation.”

Though the new process makes bone marrow donations much like
ordinary blood donations, the matching problem remains. Deep genetic

compatibility is critical in bone marrow transplants,
because our bodies are xenophobic: white blood cells produced from a donor’s
imperfectly

matched blood stem cells treat the recipient patient’s body
as foreign, attacking it. This is graft versus host disease, which can be fatal
or can result

in lifelong medical problems for the transplant recipient.
All donations from another person, except for one’s identical twin, produce at
least

some graft versus host disease in the recipient, but the
closer the genetic match, the less disease. Matching is easy in ordinary blood
transfusions,

because there are only four basic blood types. But there are
millions of marrow cell types, so good matches are hard to find. The more
diverse the

patient’s genetic heritage, the rarer the match. For
example, African-Americans have especially great difficulty finding a
compatible unrelated

donor, as they tend to have a mix of African, Caucasian, and
Native-American genes, and fewer potential donors are registered in the
national

civilian registry. * * *

The plaintiff nonprofit proposes to mitigate this matching
problem by using a financial incentive. The idea is that the financial
incentive will

induce more potential donors to sign up, stay in touch so
that they can be located when necessary, and go through with the donations. The

nonprofit plans to focus its attention initially on minority
and mixed race donors, because their marrow cell types are rarer. The financial

incentives would be $3,000 in scholarships, housing
allowances, or gifts to charities of the donor’s choice, which the nonprofit
acknowledges

would be “valuable consideration” under the statutory
prohibition.

Plaintiffs argue that the National Organ Transplant Act, as
applied to the MoreMarrowDonors.org’s planned pilot program, violates the

Equal Protection Clause. They claim that blood stem cell
harvesting is not materially different from blood, sperm, and egg harvesting,
which are

#227

not included under the statutory or regulatory definitions
of “human organ.” Like donors of blood and sperm, a bone marrow donor
undergoing

apheresis suffers no permanent harm, experiences no
significant risk, and quickly regenerates what is donated. Plaintiffs also
argue that any

rational basis that Congress had when it passed the statute
no longer exists with respect to the pilot program, because of the subsequent

development of the apheresis method. Plaintiffs seek
declaratory and injunctive relief so that MoreMarrowDonors.org can proceed with
the

initiative. * * *

As for whether the distinction between the organs or other
body substances for which compensation is permitted and those for which it is

prohibited has a rational basis, there are two classes of
rational basis here: policy concerns and philosophical concerns. The policy
concerns are

obvious. Some are mentioned in the legislative history,
though they need not be. Congress may have been concerned that if donors could
be paid,

rich patients or the medical industry might induce poor
people to sell their organs, even when the transplant would create excessive
medical risk,

pain, or disability for the donor. Or, looking from the
other end, Congress might have been concerned that every last cent could be
extracted from

sick patients needful of transplants, by well-matched
potential donors making “your money or your life” offers. The existing commerce
in organs

extracted by force or fraud by organ thieves might be
stimulated by paying for donations. Compensation to donors might also degrade
the quality

of the organ supply, by inducing potential donors to lie
about their medical histories in order to make their organs marketable.
Plaintiffs argue

that a $3,000 housing subsidy, scholarship, or charitable
donation is too small an amount to create a risk of any of these evils, but for
a lot of

people that could amount to three to six months’ rent.

Congress may have had philosophical as well as policy
reasons for prohibiting compensation. People tend to have an instinctive
revulsion at

denial of bodily integrity, particularly removal of flesh
from a human being for use by another, and most particularly “commodification”
of such

conduct, that is, the sale of one’s bodily tissue. While
there is reportedly a large international market for the buying and selling of
human organs,

in the United States, such a market is criminal and the
commerce is generally seen as revolting. Leon Kass examines the philosophical
issue of

commodification[.] * * * To account for why most of us are
revolted by the notion of a poor person selling a kidney to feed his family,
Kass cites

the taboos we have against cannibalism, defilement of
corpses, and necrophilia. Kass points to the idea of “psychophysical unity, a
position that

regards a human being as largely, if not wholly, self
identical with his enlivened body,” so that, as Kant put it, to “ ‘dispose of
oneself as a mere

means to some end of one’s own liking is to degrade the
humanity in one’s person.’ ” In this view, “organ transplantation... is—once we

#228

strip away the trappings of the sterile operating rooms and
their astonishing technologies—simply a noble form of cannibalism.”

These reasons are in some respects vague, in some
speculative, and in some arguably misplaced. There are strong arguments for
contrary

views. But these policy and philosophical choices are for
Congress to make, not us. The distinctions made by Congress must have a
rational

basis, but do not need to fit perfectly with that rational
basis, and the basis need merely be rational, not persuasive to all. Here,
Congress made a

distinction between body material that is compensable and
body material that is not. The distinction has a rational basis, so the
prohibition on

compensation for bone marrow donations by the aspiration
method does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.

The focus, though, of plaintiffs’ arguments is compensation
for “bone marrow donations” by the peripheral blood stem cell apheresis

method. For this, we need not answer any constitutional
question, because the statute contains no prohibition. Such donations of cells
drawn

from blood flowing through the veins may sometimes
anachronistically be called “bone marrow donations,” but none of the soft,
fatty marrow is

donated, just cells found outside the marrow, outside the
bones, flowing through the veins.

Congress could not have had an intent to address the
apheresis method when it passed the statute, because the method did not exist
at that

time. We must construe the words of the statute to see what
they imply about extraction of hematopoietic stem cells by this method. This
issue

has not been addressed by any of our sister circuits.

Since payment for blood donations has long been common, the
silence in the National Organ Transplant Act on compensating blood donors

is loud. “Blood” is omitted from the list of examples of
“human organs” in the statute and the regulation. The statute says “human
organ” is

defined as a human “kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas,
bone marrow, cornea, eye, bone, and skin or any subpart thereof and any other
human

organ... specified by the Secretary of Health and Human
Services by regulation.” 42 U.S.C. § 274e(c)(1). The regulation adds intestines
and the

rest of the gastrointestinal tract to the list: “kidney,
liver, heart, lung, pancreas, bone marrow, cornea, eye, bone, skin, and
intestine, including the

esophagus, stomach, small and/or large intestine, or any
portion of the gastrointestinal tract.” 42 C.F.R. § 121.13 (2010). Neither the
statute nor

the regulation defines “human organ” to include “blood.” The
government concedes that the common practice of compensating blood donors is

not prohibited by the statute.

The government argues that hematopoietic stem cells in the
veins should be treated as “bone marrow” because “bone marrow” is a statutory

organ, and the statute prohibits compensation not only for
donation of an organ, but also “any subpart thereof.” Hematopoietic stem cells
are

formed in the bone marrow, and most are found there because
they generally mature into blood cells and platelets in the marrow. Therefore,

#229

the government argues, they should be viewed as “subparts”
of the bone marrow, even when these stem cells are obtained through apheresis,

which is to say, from blood flowing through veins.

We reject this argument, because it proves too much, and
because it construes words to mean something different from ordinary usage. If

the government’s argument that what comes from the marrow is
a subpart of the marrow were correct, then the statute would prohibit

compensating blood donors. The red and white blood cells
that flow through the veins come from the bone marrow, just like hematopoietic
stem

cells. But the government implicitly concedes that these red
and white blood cells are not “subparts” of bone marrow under the statute,
because it

explicitly concedes that the statute does not prohibit
compensation for blood donations.

As for ordinary usage, the bloodstream consists of plasma
containing red cells, white cells, platelets, stem cells that will mature into
one of

these, and other material. We call this liquid as a whole
“blood.” No one calls it “bone marrow,” even though these cells come from the
marrow.

There is no reason to think that Congress intended “bone
marrow” to mean something so different from ordinary usage. Also, the blood
contains

not only blood cells and stem cells, but also other
substances that come from elsewhere in the body. For example, the blood
contains vitamin

B12, which enters the bloodstream after binding with
intrinsic factor and being absorbed from the small intestine. The government’s
argument

would treat vitamin B12 as a “subpart” of the intestines,
and the regulation prohibits paying donors for their intestines or subparts
thereof. But

every blood draw contains some vitamin B12, and we still
call the red liquid “blood,” not “guts.”

Likewise, every blood draw includes some hematopoietic stem
cells. All that differentiates the blood drawn in peripheral blood stem cell

apheresis from the blood drawn from a compensated blood
donor, other than the filtration process, is the medicine given to donors in
the days

before the blood draw to increase hematopoietic stem cell
secretion. Once the stem cells are in the bloodstream, they are a “subpart” of
the blood,

not the bone marrow. The word “subpart” refers to the organ
from which the material is taken, not the organ in which it was created. Taking
part

of the liver for a liver donation would violate the statute
because of the “subpart thereof” language. But taking something from the blood
that is

created in the marrow takes only a subpart of the blood. * *
*

We construe “bone marrow” to mean the soft, fatty substance
in bone cavities, as opposed to blood, which means the red liquid that flows

through the blood vessels. The statute does not prohibit
compensation for donations of blood and the substances in it, which include
peripheral

blood stem cells. The Secretary of Health and Human Services
has not exercised regulatory authority to define blood or peripheral blood stem

cells as organs. We therefore need not decide whether
prohibiting compensation for such donations would be unconstitutional.

#230

It may be that “bone marrow transplant” is an anachronism
that will soon fade away, as peripheral blood stem cell apheresis replaces

aspiration as the transplant technique, much as “dial the
phone” is fading away now that telephones do not have dials. Or it may live on,
as

“brief” does, even though “briefs” are now lengthy arguments
rather than, as they used to be, brief summaries of authorities. Either way,
when

the “peripheral blood stem cell apheresis” method of “bone
marrow transplantation” is used, it is not a transfer of a “human organ” or a
“subpart

thereof” as defined by the statute and regulation, so the
statute does not criminalize compensating the donor.

REVERSED.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Why is it rational for Congress to decide that
compensation can be paid for the transfer of blood, sperm, and eggs, but not
bone marrow, when

the effect of this is to condemn significant numbers of
persons to premature death? Can this distinction be sustained by the argument
that many persons

find organ sales to be similar to cannibalism?

2 .If blood, sperm, and eggs can be sold, but other body
organs and fluids can only be donated (gifted), does this mean that blood,
sperm and eggs

are “property,” whereas other body parts and fluids are not?
Or is it more accurate to say that any body part or fluid that can be
transferred, by sale or

gift, is property, with the possibility of sale going only
to the details of what one can do with this property? If Mr. Moore could donate
his spleen cells,

why are they not his property? For that matter, what is the
court doing when it construes the term “subpart”? Is there a requirement here
that thinghood

is required for there to be property and that we need to
know which thing is which? Could Congress redefine terms like “part” and
“subpart” in any

fashion it chooses?

3 .Given that racial minorities and mixed race persons have
more difficulty obtaining donated bone marrow, because of the rarity of the

composition of their bone marrow type, should the
prohibition on paying compensation for bone marrow be subject to more than
“rational basis”

scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause? Note that the
Supreme Court has held that disparities in the treatment of persons based on
race are subject to

heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause only
if the disparities are “intentional.” Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 ( 1976
). In contrast,

employment restrictions and housing policies are prohibited
by the Civil Rights Acts if they have a “disparate impact” on racial
minorities. Should

something more than the most minimal scrutiny be required
under the Equal Protection Clause when statutes are shown to have a disparate
impact on

minorities, especially if that disparity can mean the
difference between life and death?

4 .Thousands of persons in the United States die each year
waiting for a kidney transplant. Kidneys, under the statute, can only be
donated; it is

unlawful to pay compensation to a person for giving up a
kidney to be used for transplant purposes, even though there is comparatively
little risk to a

```



231



```

healthy person in giving up one of their two kidneys for
these purposes. Taking different and approaches, Spain and Iran are the only
countries in which

there is currently no shortage of kidneys for transplant.
Spain employs presumed consent and a unique program of systematically
approaching family

members at the time of the death of a loved one. Iran
provides for a system of donor compensation by the public and (predominantly)
the recipient. See

Emily Steeb, The Gift of Life: Can the Organ Procurement
Philosophies from Spain and Iran Help Eliminate the Organ Shortage in the
United States?,

25 Ind. Int’l & Comp. L. Rev. 311 ( 2015 ).

5 .By construing the statute to apply only to the
traditional form of bone marrow aspiration, but not to peripheral blood stem
cell apheresis, has the

court in effect given a near complete victory to the
plaintiffs? As the court indicates, few if any donors would choose the painful
form of needle

extraction over the newer method, which is more like a
prolonged blood donation. Given the policy concerns and the philosophical
concerns that the

court attributes to Congress, should the court give the
plaintiffs a complete victory by statutory interpretation when it is unwilling
to do the same by

constitutional interpretation? Or is this in fact a
desirable way to proceed, given that the statutory interpretation route can be
overridden by Congress?

6 .For a variety of perspectives on the shortage of organs
for transplantation and suggestions for reform, see Organs and Inducements, 77
Law &

Contemp. Probs. No. 3 ( 2014 ); see also Julia D. Mahoney,
Altruism, Markets, and Organ Procurement, 72 Law & Contemp. Probs. 17

paired kidney donations, see Nathan B. Oman, Beyond Gift and Bargain: Some
Suggestions for

### 2 .THE RIGHT OF PUBLICITY

Although courts like Moore and legislatures like the U.S.
Congress that adopted the National Organ Transplant Act are wary of

characterizing body parts and fluids as property, courts and
legislatures have been more receptive to the idea that an individual’s unique
persona

or personality can be regarded as property. The
jurisprudence here began with an extension of tort law to protect privacy, but
the law has evolved

in ways that make clear the “right of publicity” has most of
the attributes of property.

#### Midler v. Ford Motor Company

```



United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 1988.



849 F. 2 d 460.



```

■
NOONAN, CIRCUIT JUDGE: This case centers on the protectibility of the voice of
a celebrated chanteuse from commercial exploitation without her

consent. Ford Motor Company and its advertising agency,
Young & Rubicam, Inc., in 1985 advertised the Ford Lincoln Mercury with a
series of

nineteen 30 or 60 second television commercials in what the
agency

#232

called “The Yuppie Campaign.” The aim was to make an
emotional connection with Yuppies, bringing back memories of when they were in

college. Different popular songs of the seventies were sung
on each commercial. The agency tried to get “the original people,” that is, the
singers

who had popularized the songs, to sing them. Failing in that
endeavor in ten cases the agency had the songs sung by “sound alikes.” Bette
Midler,

the plaintiff and appellant here, was done by a sound alike.

Midler is a nationally known actress and singer. She won a
Grammy as early as 1973 as the Best New Artist of that year. Records made by

her since then have gone Platinum and Gold. She was
nominated in 1979 for an Academy award for Best Female Actress in The Rose, in
which

she portrayed a pop singer. Newsweek in its June 30, 1986
issue described her as an “outrageously original singer/comedian.” Time hailed
her in

its March 2, 1987 issue as “a legend” and “the most dynamic
and poignant singer-actress of her time.”

When Young & Rubicam was preparing the Yuppie Campaign
it presented the commercial to its client by playing an edited version of

Midler singing “Do You Want To Dance,” taken from the 1973
Midler album, “The Divine Miss M.” After the client accepted the idea and form

of the commercial, the agency contacted Midler’s manager,
Jerry Edelstein. The conversation went as follows: “Hello, I am Craig Hazen
from

Young and Rubicam. I am calling you to find out if Bette
Midler would be interested in doing.. .?” Edelstein: “Is it a commercial?”
“Yes.” “We

are not interested.”

Undeterred, Young & Rubicam sought out Ula Hedwig whom
it knew to have been one of “the Harlettes” a backup singer for Midler for ten

years. Hedwig was told by Young & Rubicam that “they
wanted someone who could sound like Bette Midler’s recording of [Do You Want To

Dance].” She was asked to make a “demo” tape of the song if
she was interested. She made an a capella demo and got the job.

At the direction of Young & Rubicam, Hedwig then made a
record for the commercial. The Midler record of “Do You Want To Dance” was

first played to her. She was told to “sound as much as
possible like the Bette Midler record,” leaving out only a few “aahs”
unsuitable for the

commercial. Hedwig imitated Midler to the best of her
ability.

After the commercial was aired Midler was told by “a number
of people” that it “sounded exactly” like her record of “Do You Want To

Dance.” Hedwig was told by “many personal friends” that they
thought it was Midler singing the commercial. Ken Fritz, a personal manager in

the entertainment business not associated with Midler,
declares by affidavit that he heard the commercial on more than one occasion
and thought

Midler was doing the singing.

Neither the name nor the picture of Midler was used in the
commercial; Young & Rubicam had a license from the copyright holder to use

the song. At issue in this case is only the protection of
Midler’s voice.

#233

The district court described the defendants’ conduct as that
“of the average thief.” They decided, “If we can’t buy it, we’ll take it.” The
court

nonetheless believed there was no legal principle preventing
imitation of Midler’s voice and so gave summary judgment for the defendants.

Midler appeals.

The First Amendment protects much of what the media do in
the reproduction of likenesses or sounds. A primary value is freedom of

speech and press. Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U.S. 374, 388
(1967). The purpose of the media use of a person’s identity is central. If the
purpose is

“informative or cultural” the use is immune; “if it serves
no such function but merely exploits the individual portrayed, immunity will
not be

granted.” Felcher and Rubin, Privacy, Publicity and the
Portrayal of Real People by the Media, 88 Yale L.J. 1577, 1596 (1979).
Moreover,

federal copyright law preempts much of the area. “Mere
imitation of a recorded performance would not constitute a copyright
infringement even

where one performer deliberately sets out to simulate
another’s performance as exactly as possible.” Notes of Committee on the
Judiciary, 17

U.S.C.A. § 1 14(b). It is in the context of these First
Amendment and federal copyright distinctions that we address the present
appeal.

Nancy Sinatra once sued Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company on
the basis of an advertising campaign by Young & Rubicam featuring

“These Boots Are Made For Walkin’,” a song closely
identified with her; the female singers of the commercial were alleged to have
imitated her

voice and style and to have dressed and looked like her. The
basis of Nancy Sinatra’s complaint was unfair competition; she claimed that the

song and the arrangement had acquired “a secondary meaning”
which, under California law, was protectible. This court noted that the
defendants

“had paid a very substantial sum to the copyright proprietor
to obtain the license for the use of the song and all of its arrangements.” To
give

Sinatra damages for their use of the song would clash with
federal copyright law. Summary judgment for the defendants was affirmed.
Sinatra v.

Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 435 F.2d 711, 717–718 (9th
Cir. 1970). If Midler were claiming a secondary meaning to “Do You Want To
Dance,”

or seeking to prevent the defendants from using that song,
she would fail like Sinatra. But that is not this case. Midler does not seek
damages for

Ford’s use of “Do You Want To Dance,” and thus her claim is
not preempted by federal copyright law. Copyright protects “original works of

authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.” 17
U.S.C. § 102(a). A voice is not copyrightable. The sounds are not “fixed.” What
is

put forward as protectible here is more personal than any
work of authorship.

Bert Lahr once sued Adell Chemical Co. for selling Lestoil
by means of a commercial in which an imitation of Lahr’s voice accompanied a

cartoon of a duck. Lahr alleged that his style of vocal
delivery was distinctive in pitch, accent, inflection, and sounds. The First
Circuit held that

Lahr had stated a cause of action for unfair competition,
that it could

#234

be found “that defendant’s conduct saturated plaintiff’s
audience, curtailing his market.” Lahr v. Adell Chemical Co., 300 F.2d 256, 259
(1st Cir.

1962). That case is more like this one. But we do not find
unfair competition here. One-minute commercials of the sort the defendants put
on

would not have saturated Midler’s audience and curtailed her
market. Midler did not do television commercials. The defendants were not in

competition with her. See Halicki v. United Artists
Communications, Inc., 812 F.2d 1213 (9th Cir. 1987).

California Civil Code section 3344 is also of no aid to
Midler. The statute affords damages to a person injured by another who uses the

person’s “name, voice, signature, photograph or likeness, in
any manner.” The defendants did not use Midler’s name or anything else whose
use

is prohibited by the statute. The voice they used was
Hedwig’s, not hers. The term “likeness” refers to a visual image not a vocal
imitation. The

statute, however, does not preclude Midler from pursuing any
cause of action she may have at common law; the statute itself implies that
such

common law causes of action do exist because it says its
remedies are merely “cumulative.” Id. § 3344(g).

The companion statute protecting the use of a deceased
person’s name, voice, signature, photograph or likeness states that the rights
it

recognizes are “property rights.” Id. § 990(b). By analogy
the common law rights are also property rights. Appropriation of such common
law

rights is a tort in California. Motschenbacher v. R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co., 498 F.2d 821 (9th Cir. 1974). In that case what the
defendants used

in their television commercial for Winston cigarettes was a
photograph of a famous professional racing driver’s racing car. The number of
the car

was changed and a wing-like device known as a “spoiler” was
attached to the car; the car’s features of white pinpointing, an oval
medallion, and

solid red coloring were retained. The driver, Lothar
Motschenbacher, was in the car but his features were not visible. Some persons,
viewing the

commercial, correctly inferred that the car was his and that
he was in the car and was therefore endorsing the product. The defendants were
held

to have invaded a “proprietary interest” of Motschenbacher
in his own identity. Id. at 825.

Midler’s case is different from Motschenbacher’s. He and his
car were physically used by the tobacco company’s ad; he made part of his

living out of giving commercial endorsements. But, as Judge
Koelsch expressed it in Motschenbacher , California will recognize an injury
from

“an appropriation of the attributes of one’s identity.” Id.
at 824. It was irrelevant that Motschenbacher could not be identified in the
ad. The ad

suggested that it was he. The ad did so by emphasizing signs
or symbols associated with him. In the same way the defendants here used an

imitation to convey the impression that Midler was singing
for them.

Why did the defendants ask Midler to sing if her voice was
not of value to them? Why did they studiously acquire the services of a sound-

alike and instruct her to imitate Midler if Midler’s voice
was not of value

#235

to them? What they sought was an attribute of Midler’s
identity. Its value was what the market would have paid for Midler to have sung
the

commercial in person.

A voice is more distinctive and more personal than the
automobile accouterments protected in Motschenbacher. A voice is as distinctive

and personal as a face. The human voice is one of the most
palpable ways identity is manifested. We are all aware that a friend is at once
known

by a few words on the phone. At a philosophical level it has
been observed that with the sound of a voice, “the other stands before me.” D.
Ihde,

Listening and Voice 77 (1976). A fortiori, these
observations hold true of singing, especially singing by a singer of renown.
The singer manifests

herself in the song. To impersonate her voice is to pirate
her identity. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, D. Owen, Prosser & Keeton
on Torts

852 (5th ed. 1984).

We need not and do not go so far as to hold that every
imitation of a voice to advertise merchandise is actionable. We hold only that
when a

distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known
and is deliberately imitated in order to sell a product, the sellers have
appropriated

what is not theirs and have committed a tort in California.
Midler has made a showing, sufficient to defeat summary judgment, that the

defendants here for their own profit in selling their
product did appropriate part of her identity.

Reversed and remanded for trial.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Slightly more than half of the 27 states that recognize
the right of publicity have done so at least initially as a matter of judicial
lawmaking. For

new types of property, this is unusual; legislatures
typically take the lead in adding to, subtracting from, and making major
modifications to the basic set

of property rights under law. Which institution,
legislatures or courts, is the better arena for deciding whether and to what
extent to recognize rights of

publicity?

2 .Many have decried the expansive sweep of some states’
right of publicity. In one notable example the Ninth Circuit overturned a grant
of

summary judgment against Vanna White, who had claimed that
an ad based on attempted humor, which included a robot in a dress turning
letters on a

board made up to resemble the one in the television show
_Wheel of Fortune_ , violated her common-law right of publicity. In a vigorous
dissent from a

denial of rehearing _en banc_ , Judge Kozinski had this to
say:

```



* * * The majority isn’t, in fact, preventing the
“evisceration” of Vanna White’s existing rights; it’s creating a new and much
broader



property right, a right unknown in California law. It’s
replacing the existing balance between the interests of the celebrity and those
of the



public by a different balance, one substantially more
favorable to the celebrity. Instead of having an exclusive right in her name,
likeness,



signature or voice, every famous person now



```

```



236



```

```



has an exclusive right to anything that reminds the viewer
of her. After all, that’s all Samsung did: It used an inanimate object to
remind



people of White, to “evoke [her identity].” 971 F. 2 d at
1399.



Consider how sweeping this new right is. What is it about
the ad that makes people think of White? It’s not the robot’s wig, clothes or



jewelry; there must be ten million blond women (many of them
quasi-famous) who wear dresses and jewelry like White’s. It’s that the robot



is posed near the “Wheel of Fortune” game board. Remove the
game board from the ad, and no one would think of Vanna White. But once



you include the game board, anybody standing beside it—a
brunette woman, a man wearing women’s clothes, a monkey in a wig and gown—



would evoke White’s image, precisely the way the robot did.
It’s the “Wheel of Fortune” set, not the robot’s face or dress or jewelry that



evokes White’s image. The panel is giving White an exclusive
right not in what she looks like or who she is, but in what she does for a
living.



This is entirely the wrong place to strike the balance.
Intellectual property rights aren’t free: They’re imposed at the expense of
future



creators and of the public at large. Where would we be if
Charles Lindbergh had an exclusive right in the concept of a heroic solo
aviator? If



Arthur Conan Doyle had gotten a copyright in the idea of the
detective story, or Albert Einstein had patented the theory of relativity? If
every



author and celebrity had been given the right to keep people
from mocking them or their work? Surely this would have made the world



poorer, not richer, culturally as well as economically.



This is why intellectual property law is full of careful
balances between what’s set aside for the owner and what’s left in the public



domain for the rest of us: The relatively short life of
patents; the longer, but finite, life of copyrights; copyright’s
idea-expression dichotomy;



the fair use doctrine; the prohibition on copyrighting
facts; the compulsory license of television broadcasts and musical
compositions; federal



preemption of overbroad state intellectual property laws;
the nominative use doctrine in trademark law; the right to make soundalike



```

```



recordings. All of these diminish an intellectual property
owner’s rights. All let the public use something created by someone else. But
all are



necessary to maintain a free environment in which creative
genius can flourish.



The intellectual property right created by the panel here
has none of these essential limitations: No fair use exception; no right to



parody; no idea-expression dichotomy. It impoverishes the
public domain, to the detriment of future creators and the public at large.
Instead



of well-defined, limited characteristics such as name,
likeness or voice, advertisers will now have to cope with vague claims of
“appropriation



of identity,” claims often made by people with a wholly
exaggerated sense of their own fame and significance. Future Vanna Whites might



not get the chance to create their personae, because their
employers may fear some celebrity will



```

```



237



```

```



claim the persona is too similar to her own. The public will
be robbed of parodies of celebrities, and our culture will be deprived of the



valuable safety valve that parody and mockery create.



Moreover, consider the moral dimension, about which the
panel majority seems to have gotten so exercised. Saying Samsung



“appropriated” something of White’s begs the question:
Should White have the exclusive right to something as broad and amorphous as
her



“identity”? Samsung’s ad didn’t simply copy White’s
schtick—like all parody, it created something new. True, Samsung did it to make



money, but White does whatever she does to make money, too;
the majority talks of “the difference between fun and profit,” 971 F. 2 d at



1401 , but in the entertainment industry fun is profit. Why
is Vanna White’s right to exclusive for-profit use of her persona—a persona
that



might not even be her own creation, but that of a writer,
director or producer—superior to Samsung’s right to profit by creating its own



inventions? Why should she have such absolute rights to
control the conduct of others, unlimited by the idea-expression dichotomy or by
the



fair use doctrine?



To paraphrase only slightly Feist Publications, Inc. v.
Rural Telephone Service Co. , 499 U.S. 340 ( 1991 ), it may seem unfair that
much



of the fruit of a creator’s labor may be used by others
without compensation. But this is not some unforeseen byproduct of our
intellectual



property system; it is the system’s very essence.
Intellectual property law assures authors the right to their original
expression, but encourages



others to build freely on the ideas that underlie it. This
result is neither unfair nor unfortunate: It is the means by which intellectual
property



law advances the progress of science and art. We give
authors certain exclusive rights, but in exchange we get a richer public
domain. The



majority ignores this wise teaching, and all of us are the
poorer for it.

White v. Samsung Electronics America, Inc., 989 F. 2 d 1512
, 1515 – 17 ( 9 th Cir. 1993 ) (Kozinski, J., dissenting).

3 .Has Midler appropriated anything in a Lockean sense? If
so, has she left “enough and as good” for others? Did Midler labor to produce
the

unique sound of her voice, and make it familiar to millions
of listeners (especially Yuppies, or young upwardly mobile professionals)? Or
is the sound of

her voice primarily a natural attribute and accident of
birth? Incidentally, she recently did a car commercial (for Acura).

4 .Recent controversies provide mixed signals about the
trajectory of the right of publicity. Tending in the direction of lesser
protection is the

opinion in a case in which Tiger Woods sued a company that
had marketed copies of a painting by Rick Rush, “Masters of Augusta,”
commemorating

the 1997 Masters golf tournament in Augusta, Georgia, at
which Tiger Woods became the youngest player ever to win a Masters tournament.
The

painting featured a scene containing _inter alia_ three
large likenesses of Woods in the foreground, with pictures of the clubhouse and
past masters in the

background. The Sixth Circuit held that the artistic aspect
of the painting

```



238



```

gave it First Amendment protection against Woods’s right of
publicity claim. See ETW Corp. v. Jireh Pub., Inc., 332 F. 3 d 915 ( 6 th Cir.
2003 ). A more

mixed message is provided by a controversy over the use of
images invoking college football players in a video game called “NCAA
Football.” Keller v.

Electronics Arts, Inc., 2010 WL 530108 (N.D. Cal. 2010 ).
The quarterback in the game shared many features with the plaintiff, a former
starting

quarterback for Arizona State University and the University
of Nebraska, including jersey number, height, weight, and home state. The court
dismissed

the Indiana right of publicity claim but not the California
claim, based on Section 3344 (a). The court also rejected the argument that the
depictions were

sufficiently transformative to permit dismissal of the
claims as a matter of law. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. In re NCAA
Student-Athlete Name &

Likeness Licensing Litig., 724 F. 3 d 1268 ( 9 th Cir. 2013
). Should any player be able to require his permission for such uses of his
likeness? Should the

NCAA, also a defendant in the suit, require participating
schools to obtain waivers from players before they join the team?

5 .Consider the distributional implications of the right of
publicity. The right comes into play only when the invocation of a particular
person—his

or her likeness, voice, or occupation—has some commercial
value, as in advertising. Some who have invoked the right—like the Martin
Luther King

estate and Bette Midler during the period covered by this
decision—have done so to prevent commercialization of an image. But most of the
litigation

over the right has been by persons who wish to control the
use of their image in order to maximize its value in commercial ventures. This
represents a

very tiny slice of society, consisting for the most part of
highly-paid celebrities. In contrast, the restrictions on selling body parts
probably has adverse

distributional effects for the poorest strata of society,
either because poor citizens might want to sell a kidney to augment their
income or because the

poor are likely to be disadvantaged in gaming the system in
order to obtain “free” body parts when they are in need of a transplantation.

6 .What does the right of publicity tell us about the
“separation thesis” mentioned in the notes after the material on Body Parts
After _Moore_? Can a

person’s image be regarded as a “thing” separate from the
person herself? Or does the emergence of the right of publicity call into
question the validity

of the proposition that property exists only in things
separable from persons?

7 .There is a division among the states that recognize a
right of publicity as to whether the right can be inherited after the celebrity
is deceased.

What are the competing arguments here? Even if the publicity
right is inheritable, should some time limit be placed on the duration of the
right? Is the

publicity right more like copyright, which has a finite
(albeit long) duration? Or is it more like trademark, which can last
potentially forever as long as it

is continually used?

### B. ACADEMIC PERSPECTIVES ON THE DOMAIN OF PROPERTY

Before moving from personhood to customary and public
rights, we offer some academic perspectives on the general question of what

values

#239

should be subject to ownership. The first excerpt, by a
leading law-and-economics pioneer, offers a positive theory of the evolution of
property

rights. Harold Demsetz attempts to explain, in economic
terms, when and why property rights emerge in resources that previously were
regarded

as not being subject to ownership. Margaret Jane Radin, our
second author (with excerpts from two different articles), is concerned with

normative rather than positive theory. In other words, she
attempts to outline a moral basis for regarding certain things as inappropriate
subjects

for treatment as property.

```

* * * The Concept and Role of Property Rights

In the world of Robinson Crusoe property rights play no
role. Property rights are an instrument of society and derive their
significance from

the fact that they help a man form those expectations which
he can reasonably hold in his dealings with others. These expectations find

expression in the laws, customs, and mores of a society. An
owner of property rights possesses the consent of fellowmen to allow him to act
in

particular ways. An owner expects the community to prevent
others from interfering with his actions, provided that these actions are not

prohibited in the specifications of his rights.

It is important to note that property rights convey the
right to benefit or harm oneself or others. Harming a competitor by producing
superior

products may be permitted, while shooting him may not. A man
may be permitted to benefit himself by shooting an intruder but be prohibited

from selling below a price floor. It is clear, then, that
property rights specify how persons may be benefited and harmed, and,
therefore, who must

pay whom to modify the actions taken by persons. The
recognition of this leads easily to the close relationship between property
rights and

externalities.

Externality is an ambiguous concept. For the purposes of
this paper, the concept includes external costs, external benefits, and
pecuniary as

well as nonpecuniary externalities. No harmful or beneficial
effect is external to the world. Some person or persons always suffer or enjoy
these

effects. What converts a harmful or beneficial effect into
an externality is that the cost of bringing the effect to bear on the decisions
of one or

more of the interacting persons is too high to make it
worthwhile, and this is what the term shall mean here. “Internalizing” such
effects refers to

a process, usually a change in property rights, that enables
these effects to bear (in greater degree) on all interacting persons.

A primary function of property rights is that of guiding
incentives to achieve a greater internalization of externalities. Every cost
and benefit

#240

associated with social interdependencies is a potential
externality. One condition is necessary to make costs and benefits
externalities. The cost of

a transaction in the rights between the parties
(internalization) must exceed the gains from internalization. In general,
transacting cost can be

large relative to gains because of “natural” difficulties in
trading or they can be large because of legal reasons. In a lawful society the
prohibition

of voluntary negotiations makes the cost of transacting
infinite. Some costs and benefits are not taken into account by users of
resources

whenever externalities exist, but allowing transactions
increases the degree to which internalization takes place. * * *

The Emergence of Property Rights

If the main allocative function of property rights is the
internalization of beneficial and harmful effects, then the emergence of
property

rights can be understood best by their association with the
emergence of new or different beneficial and harmful effects.

Changes in knowledge result in changes in production
functions, market values, and aspirations. New techniques, new ways of doing
the

same things, and doing new things—all invoke harmful and
beneficial effects to which society has not been accustomed. It is my thesis in
this

part of the paper that the emergence of new property rights
takes place in response to the desires of the interacting persons for
adjustment to new

benefit-cost possibilities.

The thesis can be restated in a slightly different fashion:
property rights develop to internalize externalities when the gains of
internalization

become larger than the cost of internalization. Increased
internalization, in the main, results from changes in economic values, changes
which

stem from the development of new technology and the opening
of new markets, changes to which old property rights are poorly attuned. A

proper interpretation of this assertion requires that
account be taken of a community’s preferences for private ownership. Some
communities will

have less well-developed private ownership systems and more
highly developed state ownership systems. But, given a community’s tastes in
this

regard, the emergence of new private or state owned property
rights will be in response to changes in technology and relative prices.

I do not mean to assert or to deny that the adjustments in
property rights which take place need be the result of a conscious endeavor to
cope

with new externality problems. These adjustments have arisen
in Western societies largely as a result of gradual changes in social mores and
in

common law precedents. At each step of this adjustment
process, it is unlikely that externalities per se were consciously related to
the issue being

resolved. These legal and moral experiments may be
hit-and-miss procedures to some extent but in a society that weights the
achievement of

efficiency heavily, their viability in the long run will
depend on how well they modify behavior to accommodate to the

#241

externalities associated with important changes in
technology or market values.

A rigorous test of this assertion will require extensive and
detailed empirical work. A broad range of examples can be cited that are

consistent with it: the development of air rights, renters’
rights, rules for liability in automobile accidents, etc. In this part of the
discussion, I

shall present one group of such examples in some detail.
They deal with the development of private property rights in land among
American

Indians. These examples are broad ranging and come fairly
close to what can be called convincing evidence in the field of anthropology.

The question of private ownership of land among aboriginals
has held a fascination for anthropologists. It has been one of the intellectual

battlegrounds in the attempt to assess the “true nature” of
man unconstrained by the “artificialities” of civilization. In the process of
carrying on

this debate, information has been uncovered that bears
directly on the thesis with which we are now concerned. What appears to be
accepted as a

classic treatment and a high point of this debate is Eleanor
Leacock’s memoir on The Montagnais “Hunting Territory” and the Fur Trade.^3

Leacock’s research followed that of Frank G. Speck^4 who had
discovered that the Indians of the Labrador Peninsula had a long-established

tradition of property in land. This finding was at odds with
what was known about the Indians of the American Southwest and it prompted

Leacock’s study of the Montagnes who inhabited large regions
around Quebec.

Leacock clearly established the fact that a close
relationship existed, both historically and geographically, between the
development of

private rights in land and the development of the commercial
fur trade. The factual basis of this correlation has gone unchallenged.
However, to

my knowledge, no theory relating privacy of land to the fur
trade has yet been articulated. The factual material uncovered by Speck and
Leacock

fits the thesis of this paper well, and in doing so, it
reveals clearly the role played by property right adjustments in taking account
of what

economists have often cited as an example of an
externality—the overhunting of game.

Because of the lack of control over hunting by others, it is
in no person’s interest to invest in increasing or [maintaining] the stock of
game.

Overly intensive hunting takes place. Thus a successful hunt
is viewed as imposing external costs on subsequent hunters—costs that are not

taken into account fully in the determination of the extent
of hunting and of animal husbandry.

Before the fur trade became established, hunting was carried
on primarily for purposes of food and the relatively few furs that were

#242

required for the hunter’s family. The externality was
clearly present. Hunting could be practiced freely and was carried on without
assessing its

impact on other hunters. But these external effects were of
such small significance that it did not pay for anyone to take them into
account. There

did not exist anything resembling private ownership in land.
And in the Jesuit Relations , particularly Le Jeune’s record of the winter he
spent

with the Montagnes in 1633–34 and in the brief account given
by Father Druilletes in 1 647–48, Leacock finds no evidence of private land

holdings. Both accounts indicate a socioeconomic
organization in which private rights to land are not well developed.

We may safely surmise that the advent of the fur trade had
two immediate consequences. First, the value of furs to the Indians was
increased

considerably. Second, and as a result, the scale of hunting
activity rose sharply. Both consequences must have increased considerably the

importance of the externalities associated with free
hunting. The property right system began to change, and it changed specifically
in the

direction required to take account of the economic effects
made important by the fur trade. The geographical or distributional evidence
collected

by Leacock indicates an unmistakable correlation between
early centers of fur trade and the oldest and most complete development of the
private

hunting territory.

By the beginning of the eighteenth century, we begin to have
clear evidence that territorial hunting and trapping arrangements by

individual families were developing in the area around
Quebec.... The earliest references to such arrangements in this region

indicates a purely temporary allotment of hunting
territories. They [Algonkians and Iroquois] divide themselves into several
bands in

order to hunt more efficiently. It was their custom to
appropriate pieces of land about two leagues square for each group to hunt

exclusively. Ownership of beaver houses, however, had
already become established, and when discovered, they were marked. A

starving Indian could kill and eat another’s beaver if he
left the fur and the tail.^5

The next step toward the hunting territory was probably a
seasonal allotment system. An anonymous account written in 1723 states that the

“principle of the Indians is to mark off the hunting ground
selected by them by blazing the trees with their crests so that they may never
encroach

on each other.... By the middle of the century these
allotted territories were relatively stabilized.”^6

The principle that associates property right changes with
the emergence of new and reevaluation of old harmful and beneficial effects

suggests in this instance that the fur trade made it
economic to encourage

#243

the husbanding of fur-bearing animals. Husbanding requires
the ability to prevent poaching and this, in turn, suggests that socioeconomic

changes in property in hunting land will take place. The
chain of reasoning is consistent with the evidence cited above. Is it
inconsistent with the

absence of similar rights in property among the southwestern
Indians?

Two factors suggest that the thesis is consistent with the
absence of similar rights among the Indians of the southwestern plains. The
first of

these is that there were no plains animals of commercial
importance comparable to the fur-bearing animals of the forest, at least not
until cattle

arrived with Europeans. The second factor is that animals of
the plains are primarily grazing species whose habit is to wander over wide
tracts of

land. The value of establishing boundaries to private
hunting territories is thus reduced by the relatively high cost of preventing
the animals from

moving to adjacent parcels. Hence both the value and cost of
establishing private hunting lands in the Southwest are such that we would
expect

little development along these lines. The externality was
just not worth taking into account.

The lands of the Labrador Peninsula shelter forest animals
whose habits are considerably different from those of the plains. Forest
animals

confine their territories to relatively small areas, so that
the cost of internalizing the effects of husbanding these animals is
considerably reduced.

This reduced cost, together with the higher commercial value
of fur-bearing forest animals, made it productive to establish private hunting
lands.

Frank G. Speck finds that family proprietorship among the
Indians of the Peninsula included retaliation against trespass. Animal
resources were

husbanded. Sometimes conservation practices were carried on
extensively. Family hunting territories were divided into quarters. Each year
the

family hunted in a different quarter in rotation, leaving a
tract in the center as a sort of bank, not to be hunted over unless forced to
do so by a

shortage in the regular tract. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Demsetz’s theory is built around the costs and benefits
of property rights. One such cost is the cost of excluding others—marking
boundary

lines, putting up fences, suing trespassers. Robert
Ellickson points out that one reason private ownership based on exclusion is
cheaper than communal

ownership and mutual monitoring is that the technologies for
monitoring are cheaper in the case of exclusion:

```



Because private property in land necessitates the policing
of boundaries, advances in surveying and fencing techniques may enhance the



comparative efficiency of the institution. Preliterate
societies developed many simple technologies that a landowner could use to
detect and



deter trespassers. During Hammurabi’s reign around 1750
B.C., pegs were used to mark borders. Cairns, dikes, and stone walls are even
more



graphic and immovable. In



```

```



244



```

```



social environments in which neighbors are inclined to
cooperate, physically marked boundaries, if uncontroversially placed, are
largely self-



enforcing. A four-year old can understand the convention
that one does not cross a marked boundary. By contrast, the internal work rules
that



govern behavior within group-owned land are not nearly as
plain to observers.



For millennia, absentee owners have employed simple
technologies such as hedges, moats, and impregnable fencing to keep out persons



and animals that do not respect boundaries. In addition,
domesticated dogs, especially ones that instinctively bark at or attack
strangers, are



superb boundary defenders. By contrast, dogs are quite
useless in enforcing a group’s internal rules of conduct. Can a dog be trained
to bark



when a familiar person has shirked or pilfered? A modern-day
landowner intent on detecting boundary violations can resort, in lieu of a dog,



to an inexpensive electronic motion detector. “Shirking
detectors”—devices that would sound an alarm when a worker was simply going



through the motions—have yet to be invented.



```

Robert C. Ellickson, Property in Land, 102 Yale L.J. 1315 ,
1328 – 29 ( 1993 ) (footnotes omitted). Is excluding others always cheaper than
policing the

behavior of those with permitted access? Ellickson notes
that things tend to become less clear when the externalities involve larger
rather than smaller

events. Also, many (most?) assets are best used by more than
one person. Such multi-party use typically requires more than a simple
exclusionary

regime.

2 .If an increase in the value of an asset (and hence the
stakes of a resource conflict) can lead to the emergence of property rights,
the reverse

should also be true: If an asset becomes less valuable, will
less effort be expended on protecting property rights in the asset, resulting
in the

abandonment of the asset into the public domain in extreme
situations? Such cases have been documented. In an interesting study of
property rights in

the nineteenth-century American West, Anderson and Hill show
that as land and animals increased and then decreased in value, property rights
to them

became correspondingly more and then less articulated. Terry
L. Anderson & P.J. Hill, The Evolution of Property Rights: A Study of the
American

West, 18 J.L. & Econ. 163 , 170 – 76 ( 1975 ).
Interestingly, Demsetz’s example of property rights in beavers shows a similar
pattern; as prices for beaver

pelts have decreased in recent years, unclaimed beavers in
Manitoba are proliferating to the point where they are often considered pests,
with a

government bounty on their heads. See Beavers’ Dual Role:
National Icon and Huge Pest, N.Y. Times, Mar. 31 , 2001 , at A 4.

3 .Notwithstanding the confident tone of discussion in this
article, the nature of property rights in beavers among the Naskapi and
Montagne tribes

in Labrador actually presents some interesting complexities.
Although barely mentioned in Demsetz’s article, the rights to beaver hunting
territories

were subject to important qualifications. Individuals had a
right to take anyone’s beavers as long as it was for the individual’s own
consumption. This

may have served as an institutionalized kind of insurance

```



245



```

against famine. But this reintroduces some of the
common-pool incentives to overuse beavers, and the rule about leaving the pelt
is not easy to enforce.

According to John C. McManus, An Economic Analysis of Indian
Behavior in the North American Fur Trade, 32 J. Econ. Hist. 36 ( 1972 ), the
beaver

population decreased after the rise of the fur trade,
whereas with exclusive rights one would expect a stable or growing population.
In addition, the

Hudson’s Bay Company had to incur costs to conserve the
beavers, which should not have been necessary according to Demsetz’s model. In
a sense, the

own-consumption exception made the beavers into a
semicommons—a regime combining common and private property and in which the two
elements

interact. Here communal rights for use as food impacted the
beavers as private property in the fur trade. Henry E. Smith, Semicommon
Property Rights

and Scattering in the Open Fields, 29 J. Legal Stud. 131 ,
143 ( 2000 ). For a more systematic study of property rights in traditional
societies, see Martin J.

Bailey, Approximate Optimality of Aboriginal Property
Rights, 35 J.L. & Econ. 183 ( 1992 ).

4 .How did the property rights among the Native Americans
“evolve?” How do property rights ever evolve? Demsetz abstracts away from the

processes that supply property rights and focuses only on
the demand side: Where there is a need for property, something emerges. Others
have tried to

explore the supply of property rights. Some of these
accounts emphasize that property starts out as a social norm among the relevant
actors, and then is

embodied in a more official rule. Consider in this
connection the materials later in this Chapter about the possible efficiency of
custom and its role in

common-law adjudication. Other accounts suggest that certain
key players or entrepreneurs who stand to gain disproportionately will lobby
for the

recognition of property rights. But if property comes into
existence only if those who stand to benefit disproportionately seek it, what
reason do we have

for being optimistic that property will serve to internalize
externalities? Why won’t those seeking to establish property rights simply grab
assets and

impose costs on others? For some discussion of these issues,
see Gary D. Libecap, Contracting for Property Rights ( 1989 ); Stuart Banner,
Transitions

between Property Regimes, 31 J. Legal Stud. S 359 ( 2002 );
Saul Levmore, Two Stories About the Evolution of Property Rights, 31 J. Legal
Stud. S 421

( 2002 ); Katrina Miriam Wyman, From Fur to Fish:
Reconsidering the Evolution of Private Property, 80 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 117 ( 2005
).

5 .The Demsetzian approach would lead one to expect property
rights to emerge as new resource conflicts arise. How if at all would Demsetz

explain the decisions in Part A of this Chapter dealing with
property rights in body parts and fluids and the right of publicity? Do these
decisions, taken

as a whole, suggest that property rights in aspects of the
person are gradually emerging as technology develops new and more valuable uses
for these

things?

```



6 .Are measurable costs and benefits all that the law of
property responds to? Consider the following for a very different perspective.

* * * Most people possess certain objects they feel are
      almost part of themselves. These objects are closely bound up with personhood

because they are part of the way we constitute ourselves as
continuing personal entities in the world. They may be as different as people
are

different, but some common examples might be a wedding ring,
a portrait, an heirloom, or a house.

One may gauge the strength or significance of someone’s
relationship with an object by the kind of pain that would be occasioned by its

loss. On this view, an object is closely related to one’s
personhood if its loss causes pain that cannot be relieved by the object’s
replacement. If

so, that particular object is bound up with the holder. For
instance, if a wedding ring is stolen from a jeweler, insurance proceeds can
reimburse

the jeweler, but if a wedding ring is stolen from a loving
wearer, the price of a replacement will not restore the status quo—perhaps no
amount of

money can do so.

The opposite of holding an object that has become a part of
oneself is holding an object that is perfectly replaceable with other goods of

equal market value. One holds such an object for purely
instrumental reasons. The archetype of such a good is, of course, money, which
is almost

always held only to buy other things. A dollar is worth no
more than what one chooses to buy with it, and one dollar bill is as good as
another.

Other examples are the wedding ring in the hands of the
jeweler, the automobile in the hands of the dealer, the land in the hands of
the developer,

or the apartment in the hands of the commercial landlord. I
shall call these theoretical opposites—property that is bound up with a person
and

property that is held purely instrumentally—personal
property and fungible property respectively. * * *

Once we admit that a person can be bound up with an external
“thing” in some constitutive sense, we can argue that by virtue of this

connection the person should be accorded broad liberty with
respect to control over that “thing.” But here liberty follows from property
for

personhood; personhood is the basic concept, not liberty. Of
course, if liberty is viewed not as freedom from interference, or “negative
freedom,”

but rather as some positive will that by acting on the
external world is constitutive of the person, then liberty comes closer to
capturing the idea

of the self being intimately bound up with things in the
external world.

It intuitively appears that there is such a thing as
property for personhood because people become bound up with “things.” But this
intuitive

view does not compel the conclusion that property for
personhood deserves moral recognition or legal protection, because arguably
there is bad

as well as good in being bound up with external objects. If
there is a traditional understanding that a well-developed person must invest
herself to

some extent in external objects, there is no

#247

less a traditional understanding that one should not invest
oneself in the wrong way or to too great an extent in external objects.
Property is

damnation as well as salvation, object-fetishism as well as
moral groundwork. In this view, the relationship between the shoe fetishist and
his

shoe will not be respected like that between the spouse and
her wedding ring. At the extreme, anyone who lives only for material objects is

considered not to be a well-developed person, but rather to
be lacking some important attribute of humanity.

* * * [L]et us begin with the person conceived as bodily
      continuity. Locke says that “every Man has a Property in his own Person,” from

which it immediately follows that “[t]he Labour of his Body,
and the Work of his hands... are properly his.”^28 Though * * * Locke elsewhere

considers the person as reflective consciousness and memory,
he may well mean here that one literally owns one’s limbs and hence must own

their product. If not, perhaps property in one’s person
should be understood to mean simply that an individual has an entitlement to be
a person

or to be treated as a person. This would probably include
the right to self-preservation on which Locke bases the right to appropriate.

If it makes sense to say that one owns one’s body, then, on
the embodiment theory of personhood, the body is quintessentially personal

property because it is literally constitutive of one’s
personhood. If the body is property, then objectively it is property for
personhood. This line of

thinking leads to a property theory for the tort of assault
and battery: Interference with my body is interference with my personal
property.

Certain external things, for example, the shirt off my back,
may also be considered personal property if they are closely enough connected
with

the body.

The idea of property in one’s body presents some interesting
paradoxes. In some cases, bodily parts can become fungible commodities, just

as other personal property can become fungible with a change
in its relationship with the owner: Blood can be withdrawn and used in a

transfusion; hair can be cut off and used by a wigmaker;
organs can be transplanted. On the other hand, bodily parts may be too
“personal” to be

property at all. We have an intuition that property
necessarily refers to something in the outside world, separate from oneself.
Though the general

idea of property for personhood means that the boundary
between person and thing cannot be a bright line, still the idea of property
seems to

require some perceptible boundary, at least insofar as
property requires the notion of thing, and the notion of thing requires
separation from self.

This intuition makes it seem appropriate to call parts of
the body property only after they have been removed from the system. * * *

#248

Finally, let us consider the view that what is important in
personhood is a continuing character structure encompassing future projects or

plans, as well as past events and feelings. The general idea
of expressing one’s character through property is quite familiar. It is
frequently

remarked that dogs resemble their masters; the attributes of
many material goods, such as cars and clothes, can proclaim character traits of
their

owners. Of course, many would say that becoming too
enthralled with property takes away time and energy needed to develop other
faculties

constitutive of personhood. But, for example, if you express
your generosity by giving away fruits that grow in your orchard, then if the
orchard

ceases to be your property, you are no longer able to
express your character. This at least suggests that property may have an
important

relationship to certain character traits that partly
constitute a person.

This view of personhood also gives us insight into why
protecting people’s “expectations” of continuing control over objects seems so

important. If an object you now control is bound up in your
future plans or in your anticipation of your future self, and it is partly
these plans for

your own continuity that make you a person, then your
personhood depends on the realization of these expectations. * * *

We must construct sufficiently objective criteria to
identify close object relations that should be excluded from recognition as
personal

property because the particular nature of the relationship
works to hinder rather than to support healthy self-constitution. A key to
distinguishing

these cases is “healthy.” We can tell the difference between
personal property and fetishism the same way we can tell the difference between
a

healthy person and a sick person, or between a sane person
and an insane person. In fact, the concepts of sanity and personhood are
intertwined:

At some point we question whether the insane person is a
person at all. Using the word “we” here, however, implies that a consensus
exists and

can be discerned. Because I seek a source of objective
judgments about property for personhood, but do not wish to rely on natural law
or simple

moral realism, consensus must be a sufficient source of
objective moral criteria—and I believe it can be, sometimes, without destroying
the

meaning of objectivity. In the context of property for
personhood, then, a “thing” that someone claims to be bound up with
nevertheless should

not be treated as personal vis-à-vis other people’s claimed
rights and interests when there is an objective moral consensus that to be
bound up

with that category of “thing” is inconsistent with
personhood or healthy self-constitution.

Judgments of insanity or fetishism are both made on the
basis of the minimum indicia it takes to recognize an individual as one of us.
There

does not seem to be the same reason to restrain a private
fetishist as there would be to restrain an insane person prone to violence
against others.

But the restraint of denying the fetishist’s property
special recognition as personal is less severe than that imposed on someone

#249

deemed violently insane. To refuse on moral grounds to call
fetishist property personal is not to refuse to call it property at all. The
immediate

consequence of denying personal status to something is
merely to treat that thing as fungible property, and hence to deny only those
claims that

might rely on a preferred status of personal property. * * *

The personhood dichotomy comes about in the following way: A
general justification of property entitlements in terms of their relationship

to personhood could hold that the rights that come within
the general justification form a continuum from fungible to personal. It then
might hold

that those rights near one end of the continuum—fungible
property rights—can be overridden in some cases in which those near the other—

personal property rights—cannot be. This is to argue not
that fungible property rights are unrelated to personhood, but simply that
distinctions

are sometimes warranted depending upon the character or
strength of the connection. Thus, the personhood perspective generates a
hierarchy of

entitlements: The more closely connected with personhood,
the stronger the entitlement.

Does it make sense to speak of two levels of property,
personal and fungible? I think the answer is yes in many situations, no in many

others. Since the personhood perspective depends partly on
the subjective nature of the relationships between person and thing, it makes
more

sense to think of a continuum that ranges from a thing
indispensable to someone’s being to a thing wholly interchangeable with money.
Many

relationships between persons and things will fall somewhere
in the middle of this continuum. Perhaps the entrepreneur factory owner has

ownership of a particular factory and its machines bound up
with her being to some degree. If a dichotomy telescoping this continuum to two
end

points is to be useful, it must be because within a given
social context certain types of person-thing relationships are understood to
fall close to

one end or the other of the continuum, so that
decisionmakers within that social context can use the dichotomy as a guide to
determine which

property is worthier of protection. For example, in our
social context a house that is owned by someone who resides there is generally
understood

to be toward the personal end of the continuum. There is
both a positive sense that people are bound up with their homes and a normative
sense

that this is not fetishistic. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Radin introduces the distinction between property for
personhood and fungible property in order to distinguish between the degrees of

protection property should receive in different contexts.
For example, she argues that the government should have a higher burden of
justification to take

an occupied home by eminent domain (see Chapter X, Part C)
than to take industrial, commercial, or agricultural property. But as she
briefly suggests,

the personhood perspective can also be used to argue that
certain

```



250



```

kinds of objects that are intensely connected to personhood
should not be considered property at all.

2 .Radin distinguishes good personhood relations from bad
ones based on the idea of fetishism. Is this notion very clear? How much of a

consensus on these matters is there? Is Radin right that
denying strong property protection is not coercive to those whose property
relations are deemed

to be fetishistic? What would Radin make of the PBS program
“Antiques Roadshow,” in which people typically bring in various family
heirlooms,

patiently endure a longwinded mini-lecture on the object’s
origins and significance, and then rejoice if the expert gives a
higher-than-expected price

estimate? There is no suggestion that the participants
intend to sell the heirlooms. But does their intense interest in the monetary
valuation of the objects

at least suggest that the interplay between “personhood”
values and “fungible” values is more complex than Radin’s account implies?

3 .Which of the various things at issue in the cases in Part
A, supra, should be regarded as property for personhood as opposed to being
either

fungible or fetishistic property: cells taken from one’s
spleen; frozen sperm cells belonging to one’s father; corneas taken from one’s
deceased children;

the commercial value of a person’s image? Even if all these
things are plausibly regarded as closely linked to personhood, is it clear that
personhood

concerns are advanced by denying them some or all of the
traditional attributes of ownership? Could one argue that the persons for whom
these items

are personally important are more likely to find their
interests disregarded or abused if these things are _not_ regarded as property?

4 .Radin has more recently disclaimed the use of the terms
“objective consensus” and “health” as a basis for evaluating appropriate
property

relationships, and has written that “it will advance the
argument much better to speak directly about human flourishing.” Margaret Jane
Radin,

Reinterpreting Property 4 – 5 ( 1993 ).

Anti-Commodification and Inalienability Rules

One way to think about the restrictions on commercial sales
of body parts, as reflected in statutes like the National Organ Transplant Act,
is

that they do not deny that body parts and organs have
certain attributes of property, but rather they protect these things with what
can be called an

“inalienability rule.” See Guido Calabresi & A. Douglas
Melamed, Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Inalienability: One View of the

Cathedral, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1089, 111 1–15, 1 123–24 (1972).
Calabresi and Melamed define inalienability rules as rules that prohibit the
transfer

of an entitlement. More precisely, the rules regarding body
parts and fluids reflect a rule of market-inalienability, meaning that
transfers between

a willing buyer and willing seller are prohibited, in some
or all circumstances.

Why might it make sense to recognize property in certain
things but make them inalienable in this sense? Calabresi and Melamed suggest

that such an approach might be justified by a variety of
rationales. Such a rule might reduce externalities in some contexts, for
example if the

#251

transferee would likely use the thing in such a way as to
impose harms on third parties. They also suggest that inalienability might be
justified by

what they called “moralisms”: “If Taney is allowed to sell
himself into slavery, or to take undue risks of becoming penniless, or to sell
a kidney,

Marshall may be harmed, simply because Marshall is a
sensitive man who is made unhappy by seeing slaves, paupers or persons die
because

they have sold a kidney.” Id. at 11 12. Finally, they
suggest that inalienability rules may be justified by paternalism, if we
conclude that “a person

may be better off if he is prohibited from bargaining.” Id.
at 1 1 13–14.

Subsequent commentators have offered other rationales for
inalienability rules. Susan Rose-Ackerman argues that such rules may be

justified by imperfect information. For example, a rule that
blood may be donated but not sold may generate better information about the
quality

of the blood supply. “If it is difficult for hospitals to
judge whether blood contains the dangerous hepatitis virus, while individuals
know their

own health history, then ideally one would design a
collection system that gives contributors an incentive to reveal any past cases
of hepatitis.”

Susan Rose-Ackerman, Inalienability and the Theory of
Property Rights, 85 Colum. L. Rev. 931, 946 (1985); see also Richard Titmuss,
The Gift

Relationship: From Human Body to Social Policy (1971).
Richard Epstein emphasizes that inalienability rules may be a response to
common-

pool problems—“those contexts in which one person is not the
exclusive owner of a single resource, but shares it in indefinite proportions
with

other claimants.” Richard A. Epstein. Why Restrain
Alienation?, 85 Colum. L. Rev. 970, 978 (1985). These sorts of situations
create a danger of

overconsumption or excessive withdrawal of resources from
the common pool—often termed the “Tragedy of the Commons” (see Chapter II).

Restraints on alienation can be one tool for minimizing
these dangers and can be used to influence decisions to acquire a resource in
the first

place. See Lee Anne Fennell, Adjusting Alienability, 122
Harv. L. Rev. 1403 (2009).

Margaret Jane Radin, whom you encountered immediately above
in the excerpt on “Property and Personhood,” has also turned her sights

more specifically on the problem of inalienability rules.

* * * If some people wish to sell something that is
      identifiably personal, why not let them? In a market society, whatever some
      people wish

to buy and others wish to sell is deemed alienable. Under
these circumstances, we must formulate an affirmative case for
market-inalienability, so

that no one may choose to make fungible—commodify—a personal
attribute, right, or thing. In this Section, I propose and evaluate three

possible methods of justifying market-inalienability based

#252

on personhood: a prophylactic argument, assimilation to
prohibition, and a domino theory.

The method of justification that correlates most readily
with traditional liberal pluralism is a prophylactic argument. For the liberal
it makes

sense to countenance both selling and sharing of personal
things as the holder freely chooses. If an item of property is personal,
however,

sometimes the circumstances under which the holder places it
on the market might arouse suspicion that her act is coerced. Given that we
cannot

know whether anyone really intends to cut herself off from
something personal by commodifying it, our suspicions might sometimes justify

banning sales. The risk of harm to the seller’s personhood
in cases in which coerced transactions are permitted (especially if the thing
sought to

be commodified is normally very important to personhood),
and the great difficulties involved in trying to scrutinize every transaction
closely,

may sometimes outweigh the harm that a ban would impose on
would-be sellers who are in fact uncoerced. A prophylactic rule aims to ensure

free choice—negative liberty—by the best possible
coercion-avoidance mechanism under conditions of uncertainty. This prophylactic
argument

is one way for a liberal to justify, for example, the ban on
selling oneself into slavery. We normally view such commodification as so
destructive

of personhood that we would readily presume all instances of
it to be coerced. We would not wish, therefore, to have a rule creating a
rebuttable

presumption that such transactions are uncoerced (as with
ordinary contracts), nor even a rule that would scrutinize such transactions
case-by-

case for voluntariness, because the risk of harm to
personhood in the coerced transactions we might mistakenly see as voluntary is
so great that

we would rather risk constraining the exercise of choice by
those (if any) who really wish to enslave themselves.

A liberal pluralist might use a prophylactic justification
to prevent poor people from selling their children, sexual services, or body
parts.

The liberal would argue that an appropriate conception of
coercion should, with respect to selling these things, include the desperation
of

poverty. Poor people should not be forced to give up
personal things because the relinquishment diminishes them as persons, contrary
to the

liberal regime of respect for persons. We should presume
that such transactions are not the result of free choice. * * *

A second method of justifying market-inalienability
assimilates it to prohibition. If we accept that the commodified object is
different from

the “same” thing noncommodified and embedded in personal
relationships, then market-inalienability is a prohibition of the commodified

version, resting on some moral requirement that it not
exist. What might be the basis of such a moral requirement? Something might be

prohibited in its market form because it both creates and
exposes wealth-and class-based contingencies for obtaining things that are
critical to life

itself—for example, health care—and thus undermines a
commitment to the sanctity of life. Another reason for prohibition might be
that the use

of

#253

market rhetoric, in conceiving of the “good” and
understanding the interactions of people respecting it, creates and fosters an
inferior conception

of human flourishing. For example, we accept an inferior
conception of personhood (one allied to the extreme view of negative freedom)
if we

suppose people may freely choose to commodify themselves. *

A third method of justifying market-inalienability, the
domino theory, envisions a slippery slope leading to market domination. The
domino

theory assumes that for some things, the noncommodified
version is morally preferable; it also assumes that the commodified and

noncommodified versions of some interactions cannot coexist.
To commodify some things is simply to preclude their noncommodified analogues

from existing. Under this theory, the existence of some
commodified sexual interactions will contaminate or infiltrate everyone’s
sexuality so that

all sexual relationships will become commodified. If it is
morally required that noncommodified sex be possible, market-inalienability of

sexuality would be justified. This result can be conceived
of as the opposite of a prohibition: there is assumed to exist some moral
requirement

that a certain “good” be socially available. The domino
theory thus supplies an answer (as the prohibition theory does not) to the
liberal question

why people should not be permitted to choose both market and
nonmarket interactions: the noncommodified version is morally preferable when

we cannot have both.

We can now see how the prohibition and domino theories are
connected. The prohibition theory focuses on the importance of excluding

from social life commodified versions of certain
“goods”—such as love, friendship, and sexuality—whereas the domino theory
focuses on the

importance for social life of maintaining the noncommodified
versions. The prohibition theory stresses the wrongness of commodification—its

alienation and degradation of the person—and the domino
theory stresses the rightness of noncommodification in creating the social
context for

the proper expression and fostering of personhood. If one
explicitly adopts both prongs of this commitment to personhood, the prohibition
and

domino theories merge. * * *

Often commodification is put forward as a solution to
powerlessness or oppression, as in the suggestion that women be permitted to
sell

sexual and reproductive services. * * * The argument that
commodification empowers women is that recognition of these alienable
entitlements

will enable a needy group—poor women—to improve their
relatively powerless, oppressed condition, an improvement that would be
beneficial

to personhood. * * *

The rejoinder is that, on the contrary, commodification will
harm personhood by powerfully symbolizing, legitimating, and enforcing class

division and gender oppression. * * *

These conflicting arguments illuminate the problem with the
prophylactic argument for market-inalienability. If we now permit

#254

commodification, we may exacerbate the oppression of
women—the suppliers. If we now disallow commodification—without what I have

called the welfare-rights corollary, or large-scale
redistribution of social wealth and power—we force women to remain in
circumstances that

they themselves believe are worse than becoming sexual
commodity-suppliers. Thus, the alternatives seem subsumed by a need for social

progress, yet we must choose some regime now in order to
make progress. This dilemma of transition is the double bind.

The double bind has two main consequences. First, if we
cannot respect personhood either by permitting sales or by banning sales,
justice

requires that we consider changing the circumstances that
create the dilemma. We must consider wealth and power redistribution. Second,
we

still must choose a regime for the meantime, the transition,
in nonideal circumstances. To resolve the double bind, we have to investigate

particular problems separately; decisions must be made (and
remade) for each thing that some people desire to sell.

If we have reason to believe with respect to a particular
thing that the domino theory might hold—commodification for some means

commodification for all—we would have reason to choose
market-inalienability. But the double bind means that if we choose market-

inalienability, we might deprive a class of poor and
oppressed people of the opportunity to have more money with which to buy
adequate food,

shelter, and health care in the market, and hence deprive
them of a better chance to lead a humane life. Those who gain from the market-

inalienability, on the other hand, might be primarily people
whose wealth and power make them comfortable enough to be concerned about the

inroads on the general quality of life that commodification
would make. Yet, taking a slightly longer view, commodification threatens the

personhood of everyone, not just those who can now afford to
concern themselves about it. Whether this elitism in market-inalienability
should

make us risk the dangers of commodification will depend upon
the dangers of each case.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Consider again the various things at issue in the cases
in Part A of this Chapter: cells taken from one’s spleen; frozen sperm
belonging to one’s

father; corneas taken from one’s deceased children; the
right of publicity. How would Radin, applying her personhood theory, resolve
the questions

about whether these items should be alienable? In which
cases is the prophylactic theory most relevant? The prohibition theory? The
domino theory? In

the end, does the personhood perspective help decide whether
to adopt an inalienability rule in each of the foregoing situations?

2 .The one clear conclusion that seems to follow from
Radin’s article on market-inalienability is that minimum welfare rights are
necessary to

prevent people from being treated like commodities. Do we
need the personhood theory in order to reach this conclusion?

```



255



```

3 .To date, those concerned with freedom of contract and
economic efficiency often tend to favor expanding the domain of property rights
in

contested areas (“commodification” if you will), whereas
those who give priority to other values such as equality and community often
oppose treating

body parts, intimate relations, and personal identity like
property (“anti-commodification”). More recently, however, some feminists have
argued that

anti-commodification sometimes promotes subordination,
especially in the context of the division of marital property on divorce. See
Chapter V. More

generally, many have argued that the boundary between market
and nonmarket spheres is not fixed or sharply demarcated: Nonmarket relations
often

have market aspects and vice versa. For discussion of these
and related issues, see Rethinking Commodification: Cases and Readings in Law
and

Culture (Martha M. Ertman & Joan C. Williams eds., 2005
).

### C. COMMUNITY AND CUSTOM

Custom plays an important role within and outside the law,
and nowhere more so than when it comes to property law and institutions. Some

believe that property law grew out of earlier customs of
mutual forbearance, use rights, and the like. Custom often grows out of a
community in

order to solve a problem facing that community. If so, what
stance should the law take?

■
NELSON, D.J. This is a libel to recover the value of a fin-back whale. The
libellant lives in Provincetown and the respondent in Wellfleet. The

facts, as they appeared at the hearing, are as follows:

In the early spring months the easterly part of
Massachusetts bay is frequented by the species of whale known as the fin-back

whale. Fishermen from Provincetown pursue them in open boats
from the shore, and shoot them with bomb-lances fired from guns

made expressly for the purpose. When killed they sink at
once to the bottom, but in the course of from one to three days they rise and

float on the surface. Some of them are picked up by vessels
and towed into Provincetown. Some float ashore at high water and are left

stranded on the beach as the tide recedes. Others float out
to sea and are never recovered. The person who happens to find them on the

beach usually sends word to Provincetown, and the owner
comes to the spot and removes the blubber. The finder usually receives a

small salvage for his services. Try-works are established in
Provincetown for trying out the oil. The business is of

#256

considerable extent, but, since it requires skill and
experience, as well as some outlay of capital, and is attended with great
exposure

and hardship, few persons engage in it. The average yield of
oil is about 20 barrels to a whale. It swims with great swiftness, and for

that reason cannot be taken by the harpoon and line. Each
boat’s crew engaged in the business has its peculiar mark or device on its

lances, and in this way it is known by whom a whale is
killed.

The usage on Cape Cod, for many years, has been that the
person who kills a whale in the manner and under the circumstances

described, owns it, and this right has never been disputed
until this case. The libellant has been engaged in this business for ten years

past. On the morning of April 9, 1880, in Massachusetts bay,
near the end of Cape Cod, he shot and instantly killed with a bomb-lance

the whale in question. It sunk immediately, and on the
morning of the 12th was found stranded on the beach in Brewster, within the

ebb and flow of the tide, by one Ellis, 17 Miles from the
spot where it was killed. Instead of sending word to Provincetown, as is

customary, Ellis advertised the whale for sale at auction,
and sold it to the respondent, who shipped off the blubber and tried out the

oil. The libellant heard of the finding of the whale on the
morning of the 15th, and immediately sent one of his boat’s crew to the place

and claimed it. Neither the respondent nor Ellis knew the
whale had been killed by the libellant, but they knew or might have known, if

they had wished, that it had been shot and killed with a
bomb-lance, by some person engaged in this species of business.

The libellant claims title to the whale under this usage.
The respondent insists that this usage is invalid. It was decided by Judge
Sprague, in

Taber v. Jenny, 1 Sprague, 315, 23 F. Cas. 605 (D. Mass.
1856), that when a whale has been killed, and is anchored and left with marks
of

appropriation, it is the property of the captors; and if it
is afterwards found, still anchored, by another ship, there is no usage or
principle of law

by which the property of the original captors is diverted,
even though the whale may have dragged from its anchorage. The learned judge
says:

When the whale had been killed and taken possession of by
the boat of the Hillman, (the first taker,) it became the property of the

owners of that ship, and all was done which was then
practicable in order to secure it. They left it anchored, with unequivocal
marks of

appropriation.

In Bartlett v. Budd, 1 Low. 223, 2 F. Cas. 966 (D. Mass.
1868), the facts were these: The first officer of the libellant’s ship killed a
whale in

the Okhotsk sea, anchored it, attached a waif to the body,
and then left it and went ashore at some distance for the night. The next
morning the

#257

boats of the respondent’s ship found the whale adrift, the
anchor not holding, the cable coiled round the body, and no waif or irons
attached to it.

Judge Lowell held that, as the libellants had killed and
taken actual possession of the whale, the ownership vested in them. In his
opinion the

learned judge says:

A whale, being ferae naturae, does not become property until
a firm possession has been established by the taker. But when such

possession has become firm and complete, the right of
property is clear, and has all the characteristics of property.

He doubted whether a usage set up but not proved by the
respondents, that a whale found adrift in the ocean is the property of the
finder,

unless the first taker should appear and claim it before it
is cut in, would be valid, and remarked that “there would be great difficulty
in upholding

a custom that should take the property of A. and give it to
B., under so very short and uncertain a substitute for the statute of
limitations, and one

so open to fraud and deceit.” Both the cases cited were
decided without reference to usage, upon the ground that the property had been
acquired

by the first taker by actual possession and appropriation.

In Swift v. Gifford, 2 Low. 1 10, 23 F. Cas. 558 (D. Mass.
1872), Judge Lowell decided that a custom among whalemen in the Arctic seas,

that the iron holds the whale was reasonable and valid. In
that case a boat’s crew from the respondent’s ship pursued and struck a whale
in the

Arctic ocean, and the harpoon and the line attached to it
remained in the whale, but did not remain fast to the boat. A boat’s crew from
the

libellant’s ship continued the pursuit and captured the
whale, and the master of the respondent’s ship claimed it on the spot. It was
held by the

learned judge that the whale belonged to the respondents. It
was said by Judge Sprague, in Bourne v. Ashley, an unprinted case referred to
by

Judge Lowell in Swift v. Gifford, that the usage for the
first iron, whether attached to the boat or not, to hold the whale was fully
established; and

he added that, although local usages of a particular port
ought not to be allowed to set aside the general maritime law, this objection
did not apply

to a custom which embraced an entire business, and had been
concurred in for a long time by every one engaged in the trade.

In Swift v. Gifford, Judge Lowell also said:

The rule of law invoked in this case is one of very limited
application. The whale fishery is the only branch of industry of any

importance in which it is likely to be much used, and if a
usage is found to prevail generally in that business, it will not be open to
the

objection that it is likely to disturb the general
understanding of mankind by the interposition of an arbitrary exception.

I see no reason why the usage proved in this case is not as
reasonable as that sustained in the cases cited. Its application must
necessarily be

#258

extremely limited, and can affect but a few persons. It has
been recognized and acquiesced in for many years. It requires in the first
taker the only

act of appropriation that is possible in the nature of the
case. Unless it is sustained, this branch of industry must necessarily cease,
for no person

would engage in it if the fruits of his labor could be
appropriated by any chance finder. It gives reasonable salvage for securing or
reporting the

property. That the rule works well in practice is shown by
the extent of the industry which has grown up under it, and the general
acquiescence of

a whole community interested to dispute it. It is by no
means clear that without regard to usage the common law would not reach the
same result.

That seems to be the effect of the decisions in Taber v.
Jenny and Bartlett v. Budd. If the fisherman does all that is possible to do to
make the

animal his own, that would seem to be sufficient. Such a
rule might well be applied in the interest of trade, there being no usage or
custom to the

contrary. Holmes, Com. Law, 217. But be that as it may, I
hold the usage to be valid, and that the property in the whale was in the
libellant.

The rule of damages is the market value of the oil obtained
from the whale, less the cost of trying it out and preparing it for the market,
with

interest on the amount so ascertained from the date of
conversion. As the question is new and important, and the suit is contested on
both sides,

more for the purpose of having it settled than for the
amount involved, I shall give no costs.

Decree for libellant for $71.05, without costs.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Most customary whaling rules are variants on
first-in-time. As described by Robert Ellickson, the two major rules were the
“fast-fish-loose-fish”

rule and the “iron-holds-the-whale” rule. Under the
fast-fish-loose-fish rule, a whale belonged to the first harpooner as long as
it was attached to his

boat, in which case he got to keep the whole whale. This
rule applied in particular to right whales, which are relatively slow-moving.
Under the iron-

holds-the-whale rule, the first harpooner would get
exclusive rights to the whale as long as he was in fresh pursuit. The
iron-holds-the-whale rule tended

to be adopted where sperm whales were predominant. Sperm
whales were the most valuable and the most dangerous. Ellickson argues that
these

customs and the custom for finback whales in the _Ghen_ case
make sense in light of the different resources—types of whales—to which they
applied. He

also argues that their efficiency (from the point of view of
whalers) confirms the hypothesis that close-knit groups will devise and enforce
norms among

themselves that maximize their wealth (but may cause
uncompensated harm to those outside the group—or outgroup externalities). See
Robert C.

Ellickson, A Hypothesis of Wealth-Maximizing Norms: Evidence
from the Whaling Industry, 5 J.L. Econ. & Org. 83 ( 1989 ). For a famous
discussion of

the concept of fast fish versus loose fish, see Herman
Melville, Moby Dick, Chapter 89 ( 1851 ).

2 .The finder in _Ghen_ was not a whaler. But was he part of
a close-knit whaling community? Was he likely to have known of the custom of

notifying the owner? If not, should he have known that
someone was making a claim to the whale? Does that matter? Norms and customs
are more

easily known within a community than to outsiders, and
enforcing a custom against outsiders may cause unfair surprise and wasteful
efforts at avoiding

such surprises. See Henry E. Smith, Community and Custom in
Property, 10 Theoretical Inquiries L. 5 ( 2009 ). Moreover, a custom can be
good for

insiders but bad for society. Where did the customs of
whalers leave conservation values?

3 .Interestingly, the fast-fish-loose-fish rule seems to
have been the “default” custom and the iron-holds-the-whale rule a departure
from it only in

those areas where sperm whales predominated. The
fast-fish-loose-fish rule accords with the general norms of possession. Might
this have made it easier

to communicate to others?

4 .What is the difference between a social norm and a
custom? Although there is overlap, the idea of a social norm includes
informality and being

“beyond the law” (even sometimes against the law). Robert C.
Ellickson, Order without Law: How Neighbors Settle Disputes ( 1991 ). Custom is
closer

to the law in that it is usually more articulated, and its
normative force is close to being “legal” and sometimes winds up actually
becoming part of the

law. Eugen Ehrlich, Fundamental Principles of the Sociology
of Law (Walter L. Moll trans., 1936 ). Indeed, there was a time when the common
law was

regarded as the general custom, distinct from the customs
pertaining to localities. See David Callies, How Custom Becomes Law in England,
in Peter

Ørebech et al., The Role of Customary Law in Sustainable
Development 158 ( 2005 ). In many countries the extent of official recognition
of customary

rights is an important political issue. For example, in
sub-Saharan Africa there has even a movement to register “customary land
rights.” This has,

however, proven difficult, and where it has been
implemented, it has shifted decision-making authority away from families and
communities to the state

and its officials. See Mekonnen Firew Ayano, Rural Land
Registration in Ethiopia: Myths and Realities, 52 Law & Soc’y Rev. 1060 (
2018 ).

5 .As we will see in Chapter V, property law is more
standardized in many respects than contract law: one can tailor one’s contract,
but the basic

forms of ownership come in a small and closed menu. One
effect is that people who have to deal with this or similar property—third
parties—need not

understand much idiosyncratic detail about property
arrangements. Does the recognition of custom as law threaten to upend this
balance? Community

members may be well informed, but what about binding third
parties? Is that coercive? When is community itself a coercive institution? The
mining

camps from which customs arose that were later adapted into
federal law? The “lobster gangs” of Maine, and some (but not all) of the
communities

discussed by Ostrom in her book (excerpted in Chapter II)
employed coercion, sometimes violent, and their exclusion of outsiders could be
highly

discriminatory. See Carol M. Rose, Left Brain, Right Brain
and History in the New Law and Economics of Property, 79 Or. L. Rev. 479 , 487
– 88 ( 2000 ).

### 2 .CULTURAL PATRIMONY

Personhood and community interests are also implicated when
cultural artifacts are taken from the communities in which they have

particular significance. One notable effort to address this
problem is reflected in the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation
Act,

considered in the following case.

#### United States v. Corrow

```



United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit, 1997.



119 F. 3 d 796.



```

■ JOHN
C. PORFILIO, CIRCUIT JUDGE. This appeal raises issues of first impression in
this Circuit under the Native American Graves Protection and

Repatriation Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 3001–3013 (NAGPRA) * * *.
Richard Nelson Corrow challenges the constitutionality of 25 U.S.C. §
3001(3)(D)

of NAGPRA which defines “cultural patrimony,” the basis for
his conviction of trafficking in protected Native American cultural items in

violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1 170(b). [He] contends the
definition is unconstitutionally vague, an argument the district court rejected
in denying his

motion to dismiss that count of the indictment and to
reverse his conviction. * * * We affirm.

I.Background

Until his death in 1991 , Ray Winnie was a hataali, a Navajo
religious singer. For more than twenty-five years Mr. Winnie chanted the

Nightway and other Navajo ceremonies wearing Yei B’Chei
originally owned by Hosteen Hataali Walker. Yei B’Chei or Yei B’Chei jish are

ceremonial adornments, Native American artifacts whose
English label, “masks,” fails to connote the Navajo perception these cultural
items

embody living gods. Traditionally, a hataali passes the Yei
B’Chei to a family or clan member who has studied the ceremonies or loans the
Yei

B’Chei to another Navajo clan, Mr. Winnie having acquired
his Yei B’Chei from a different clan during his hataali apprenticeship. When
Mr.

Winnie died, he left no provision for the disposition of his
Yei B’Chei, and no family or clan member requested them.

Richard Corrow, the owner of Artifacts Display Stands in
Scottsdale, Arizona, is an afficionado of Navajo culture and religion, having,
on

occasion, participated in Navajo religious ceremonies. Some
time after Mr. Winnie’s death, Mr. Corrow traveled to Lukachukai, Arizona, to
visit

Mrs. Fannie Winnie, Mr. Winnie’s 81–year–old widow, chatting
with her; her granddaughter, Rose Bia; and other family members: a great

#261

granddaughter, Harriette Keyonnie; and a son-in-law. During
one visit, Mrs. Winnie displayed some Navajo screens and robes, and Mr. Corrow

inquired about the Yei B’Chei. By his third visit in August
1993, the Winnie family revealed the Yei B’Chei, twenty-two ceremonial masks,
and

permitted Mr. Corrow to photograph them. Mr. Corrow told
Mrs. Winnie he wanted to buy them, suggesting he planned to deliver the Yei
B’Chei

to a young Navajo chanter in Utah to keep them sacred.
Although Mr. Corrow initially offered $5,000, he readily agreed to the family’s
price of

$10,000 for the Yei B’Chei, five headdresses, and other
artifacts. Mr. Corrow drafted a receipt,^1 and Mrs. Winnie, who spoke no
English, placed

her thumbprint on the document after Ms. Bia read it to her
in Navajo.

In November 1994, the owners of the East–West Trading
Company in Santa Fe, New Mexico, contacted Mr. Corrow telling him that a

wealthy Chicago surgeon was interested in purchasing a set
of Yei B’Chei. In fact, the purported buyer was James Tanner, a National Park

Service ranger operating undercover on information he had
received about questionable trade at East–West. When Agent Tanner visited the

business, its owners showed him photographs of seventeen of
the twenty-two Yei B’Chei that Mr. Corrow purchased from Mrs. Winnie. In the

photos, he noticed eagle and owl feathers in several of the
large headdresses and ceremonial sticks bundled with small eagle feathers.
After

negotiations, Agent Tanner agreed to a purchase price of
$70,000 for the Yei B’Chei, $50,000 for Mr. Corrow and a $20,000 commission to

East–West’s co-owners.

On December 9, 1994, Mr. Corrow arrived at the Albuquerque
airport en route to Santa Fe carrying one large suitcase, one small suitcase,

and a cardboard box. Yet once he was in Santa Fe, F.B.I.
agents became worried East–West’s owners had been alerted and abandoned their
script

for the planned buy, instead directly executing the search
warrant. Agents found the two suitcases Mr. Corrow had carried to East–West,
one

holding Navajo religious objects, small bundles, herbs, mini
prayer sticks, and other artifacts adorned with eagle feathers. Another
suitcase

contained eagle feathers rolled inside several cloth
bundles, Yei B’Chei dance aprons, and five headdress pieces made of eagle and
owl feathers.

In the cardboard box was the set of twenty-two Yei B’Chei.

The government subsequently charged Mr. Corrow in a
two-count indictment, Count one for trafficking in Native American cultural
items

in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1 170, 25 U.S.C. §§ 3001(3)(D),
3002(c), and 18 U.S.C. § 2; and Count two for selling Golden Eagle, Great
Horned

Owl,

#262

and Buteoine Hawk feathers protected by the [Migratory Bird
Treaty Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 7 01–712,] in violation of 16 U.S.C. § 703, 16 U.S.C.

§ 7 07(b)(2), and 18 U.S.C. § 2. The court rejected Mr.
Corrow’s pretrial motion to dismiss Count one based on its purported
unconstitutional

vagueness, and the trial proceeded comprised predominantly
of the testimony of expert witnesses clashing over whether the Yei B’Chei

constitute “cultural patrimony” protected by NAGPRA. Having
concluded they do, the jury convicted Mr. Corrow of illegal trafficking in

cultural items, Count one, but acquitted him of Count two,
selling protected feathers, instead finding him guilty of committing the lesser
included

offense, possession of protected feathers. * * * The
district court * * * sentenced him to two concurrent five-year probationary
terms and one

hundred hours of community service.

II.NAGPRA

Congress enacted NAGPRA in 1990 to achieve two [principal]
objectives: to protect Native American human remains, funerary objects,

sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony presently
on Federal or tribal lands; and to repatriate Native American human remains,

associated funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of
cultural patrimony currently held or controlled by Federal agencies and
museums.

H.R.Rep. No. 101–877, 101st Cong., 2d Sess.1990, reprinted
in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4367, 4368. The legislation and subsequent regulations, 43

C.F.R. §§ 10.1–10.17, provide a methodology for identifying
objects; determining the rights of lineal descendants, Indian tribes and Native

Hawaiian organizations; and retrieving and repatriating that
property to Native American owners. NAGPRA’s reach in protecting against
further

desecration of burial sites and restoring countless
ancestral remains and cultural and sacred items to their tribal homes warrants
its aspirational

characterization as “human rights legislation.” Jack F.
Trope & Walter R. Echo–Hawk, The Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation

Act: Background and Legislative History, 24 Ariz. St. L.J.
35, 37 (1992). Indeed, a Panel of National Dialogue on Museum–Native American

Relations, which was convened to address the divergent
interests of the museum and Native American communities, reported to Congress
that

“[r]espect for Native human rights is the paramount
principle that should govern resolution of the issue when a claim is made.”
1990

U.S.C.C.A.N. 4369–70.

Nonetheless to give teeth to this statutory mission, 18
U.S.C. § 1170 penalizes trafficking in Native American human remains and
cultural

items and creates a felony offense for a second or
subsequent violation. Subsection 1170(b), the basis for prosecution here,
states:

Whoever knowingly sells, purchases, uses for profit, or
transports for sale or profit any Native American cultural items obtained in

violation of the Native American Grave Protection and
Repatriation Act shall be fined in accordance with this title, imprisoned not

more than one year, or both, and in the case of a

#263

second or subsequent violation, be fined in accordance with
this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.

One must look to NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. § 3001, for the
definition of “cultural item.” Section 3001(3) states:

“cultural items” means human remains and—

(D) “cultural patrimony” which shall mean an object having
ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to the Native

American group or culture itself, rather than property owned
by an individual Native American, and which, therefore, cannot be

alienated, appropriated, or conveyed by any individual
regardless of whether or not the individual is a member of the Indian tribe or

Native Hawaiian organization and such object shall have been
considered inalienable by such Native American group at the time the

object was separated from such group.

Thus, to be judged “cultural patrimony”^4 the object must
have (1) ongoing historical, cultural or traditional importance; and (2) be

considered inalienable by the tribe by virtue of the
object’s centrality in tribal culture. That is, the cultural item’s essential
function within the life

and history of the tribe engenders its inalienability such
that the property cannot constitute the personal property of an individual
tribal member.

“The key aspect of this definition is whether the property
was of such central importance to the tribe or group that it was owned
communally.”

Francis P. McManamon & Larry V. Nordby, Implementing the
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, 24 Ariz. St. L.J. 217,

233–34 (1992). The regulations mirror this definition * * *

In this prosecution, then, the definition of cultural
patrimony divided into its three component parts required the government prove
Mr.

Corrow trafficked in an object that (1) was not owned by an
individual Native American; (2) that could not be alienated, appropriated, or

conveyed by an individual; and (3) had an ongoing
historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to the Native American
group. Mr.

Corrow contends the first and second elements are
unintelligible. Thus, he argues, relying upon United States v. Agnew, 931 F.2d
1397, 1403

(10th Cir. 1991), the definition does not comport with the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it fails to give
ordinary

people fair notice about what conduct is prohibited in such
a manner that discourages arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement.

In support, Mr. Corrow arrays the conflicting expert
testimony, characterized by the amicus curiae^7 as a conflict between orthodox
and

#264

moderate Navajo religious views. For the government, Alfred
Yazzie, an ordained hataali and Navajo Nation Historic Preservation

representative, testified the Yei B’Chei must remain within
the four sacred mountains of the Navajo for they represented the “heartbeat” of
the

Navajo people. Also for the government, Harry Walters, a
Navajo anthropologist, stated there is “no such thing as ownership of medicine
bundles

and that these are viewed as living entities.” He equated
ownership with use, knowing the rituals, but acknowledged often cultural items
are sold

because of economic pressures. For Mr. Corrow, Jackson
Gillis, a medicine man from Monument Valley, testified that if no claim is made
by a

clan relative or other singer, the jish pass to the widow
who must care for them. If the widow feels uncomfortable keeping the jish, Mr.
Gillis

stated she has the right to sell them. Harrison Begay,
another of Mr. Corrow’s expert witnesses, agreed, explaining that because the
masks

themselves are “alive,” a widow, uneasy about their
remaining unused, may sell them. Billy Yellow, another hataali testifying for
Mr. Corrow,

reiterated the traditional disposition of a hataali ’s Yei
B’Chei to a spouse, the children, and grandchildren, although he stated nobody
really owns

the jish because they are living gods.

Given these conflicting views on the alienability of the Yei
B’Chei, Mr. Corrow asks how an individual, even one educated in Navajo

culture, indeed, one accepting the responsibility of
inquiring further about the status of the item as the district court deduced
from its reading of

NAGPRA, can “ascertain ownership when the group itself
cannot agree on that point?” The shadow cast by this question, he insists,
sufficiently

clouds the meaning of “cultural patrimony” to render it
unconstitutional. Mr. Corrow’s invocation of void-for-vagueness review,
however,

obfuscates both its doctrinal reach and its application to
the facts of this case.

“[T]he void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal
statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary
people

can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner
that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” Kolender v.

Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983). Although Kolender
acknowledged a judicial shift from concern over deciding whether the statute
provides

actual notice to “the more important aspect of the vagueness
doctrine... the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to

govern law enforcement,” id. at 358, the legality principle,
no crime or punishment without law, is the essence of a Fifth Amendment due
process

challenge. See 1 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive
Criminal Law § 3.1, at 271 (1986). That is, given the limitations of language
and syntax, a

statute must convey to those individuals within its purview
what it purports to prohibit and how it will punish an infraction. * * *

#265

Mr. Corrow cannot meet that burden. First, deciding whether
the statute gave him fair notice, the district court found, after reviewing all
of

the expert testimony, Mr. Corrow is knowledgeable about
Navajo traditions and culture and “would have been aware that various tribal
members

viewed ownership of property differently.” The court cited
the testimony of Ms. Charlotte Frisbie, author of Navajo Medicine Bundles or
Jish:

Acquisition, Transmission and Disposition in the Past and
Present (1987). Ms. Frisbie related several calls from Mr. Corrow inquiring
about the

prices of certain Navajo artifacts. Although she stated he
did not specifically ask her about these Yei B’Chei, she expressed her
objection to

dealers and commercial handlers selling Native American
cultural objects in the open market. Ms. Frisbie also reminded him both of the
Navajo

Nation’s implementing procedures to return cultural items
and of the enactment of NAGPRA. Most damning, Ms. Bia, Mrs. Winnie’s

granddaughter, recounted Mr. Corrow’s representation that he
wanted to buy the Yei B’Chei to pass on to another young chanter in Utah.

Reasonably, a jury could infer from that representation that
Mr. Corrow appreciated some dimension of the Yei B’Chei’s inherent
inalienability in

Navajo culture. Although Mrs. Winnie stated she believed the
Yei B’Chei belonged to her, she testified, “[t]here was another man that knew
the

ways and he had asked of [the Yei B’Chei] but I was the one
that was stalling and ended up selling it.” Although this man trained with her

husband, he had not offered her any money. This is not a
case of an unsuspecting tourist happening upon Mrs. Winnie’s hogan and
innocently

purchasing the set of Yei B’Chei. * * *

Surely, this evidence establishes Mr. Corrow had some notice
the Yei B’Chei he purchased were powerfully connected to Navajo religion

and culture. While it may be true that even the experts in
that culture differed in their views on alienability, no expert testified it
was acceptable

to sell Yei B’Chei to non-Navajos who planned to resell them
for a profit, the very conduct § 1 170(b) penalizes. All experts testified the
Yei

B’Chei resided within the Four Corners of the Navajo people
and acknowledged the ritual cleansing and restoration required were the Yei
B’Chei

to be defiled in any way. Thus, while the parameters of the
designation “cultural patrimony” might be unclear in some of its applications
and at

its edges, there is no doubt, in this case as applied to Mr.
Corrow, the Yei B’Chei were cultural items which could not be purchased for a
quick

$40,000 turn of profit. * * * Consequently, even if the term
cultural patrimony “might reflect some uncertainty as applied to extreme
situations,

the conduct for which [defendant] was prosecuted and
convicted falls squarely within the core of the [Act].” United States v. Amer,
110 F.3d 873,

878 (2d Cir. 1997). * * *

Consequently, we believe Mr. Corrow had fair notice—if not
of the precise words of NAGPRA—of their meaning that Native American

objects “having ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural
importance central to the Native American group... rather than property owned
by

#266

an individual Native American” could not be bought and sold
absent criminal consequences. Moreover, contrary to Mr. Corrow’s assertion,

§ 300 1(3)(D) is not infirm because it fails to list
examples of cultural items. “In short, due process does not require that
citizens be provided

actual notice of all criminal rules and their meanings. The
Constitution is satisfied if the necessary information is reasonably obtainable
by the

public.” United States v. Vasarajs, 908 F.2d 443, 449 (9th
Cir. 1990). * * *

While not dispositive, we would add § 1 170(b) includes
scienter as an element of the offense (“Whoever knowingly sells, purchases,
uses

for profit... .”). “A statutory requirement that an act must
be willful or purposeful may not render certain, for all purposes, a statutory
definition

of the crime which is in some respects uncertain. But it
does relieve the statute of the objection that it punishes without warning an
offense of

which the accused was unaware.” Screws v. United States, 325
U.S. 91, 101–02 (1945) (Douglas, J., concurring). Here, the government was

required to prove Mr. Corrow knowingly used the Yei B’Chei
for profit assuring his understanding of the prohibited zone of conduct. “[A]

scienter requirement may mitigate a criminal law’s vagueness
by ensuring that it punishes only those who are aware their conduct is
unlawful.”

Gaudreau, 860 F.2d at 360. * * *

We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The prohibition on individual ownership or sale of
“cultural patrimony” in the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation
Act

(NAGPRA) appears only in the definitional section of the
Act, under the definition of “cultural patrimony” (quoted in the court’s
opinion). There is no

separate prohibition, in the operative sections of the Act,
of alienation, appropriation, or conveyance of cultural patrimony. Corrow was
prosecuted

under a separate provision of the federal criminal code
making it a criminal offense to obtain any “cultural items” “in violation of
the Native American

Grave Protection and Repatriation Act.” 18 U.S.C. § 1170.
Putting the two provisions together, federal law appears to require, first, a
determination that

items cannot be subject to private ownership or sale _as a
matter of tribal law or tradition_ , and then, second, a determination that
someone has attempted

to acquire such an item in a manner prohibited by tribal law
or tradition. Does this strike you as an overly cryptic way to establish, as a
matter of federal

law, that cultural patrimony cannot be bought and sold? For

2 .Under the interpretation of NAGPRA approved in the
principal case, could Mrs. Fannie Winnie also be prosecuted for violating the
Act? If one

of the purposes of the Act is to prevent commodification of
culturally significant objects, should federal prosecutors concentrate only on
the demand for

such objects from dealers and collectors, or should they
also try to suppress the supply?

```

```

3 .One purpose of NAGPRA was to rectify the historic
disrespect shown to the graves and remains of Native Americans. Perhaps the
most high-

profile dispute under NAGPRA concerned the status of the
skeletal remains known as “Kennewick Man” and “The Ancient One,” discovered by
some

students on the banks of the Columbia River in Washington.
Preliminary carbon dating indicated that the remains were 8 , 340 to 9 , 200
years old,

predating the time when it is believed the ancestors of most
of today’s Native Americans migrated to the Americas. Some of the features of
the skeleton

were also thought by some researchers to be inconsistent
with most Native American skeletal remains. The Interior Department ordered
that the skeletal

remains be repatriated to area tribes under NAGPRA. When
this decision was challenged by a group of scientists anxious to study the
remains, the

District Court for the District of Oregon held for the
scientists and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. Bonnichsen v. United States, 969 F.
Supp. 628 (D. Or.

1997 ), aff’d, 367 F. 3 d 864 ( 9 th Cir. 2004 ). The court
held that the Act applies only to remains affiliated with presently existing
tribes, peoples, or

cultures, and held that there was no evidence that any
presently existing tribe could trace its ancestry back 9 , 000 years.
Controversies continued to swirl

around the remains, which were housed for many years at the
University of Washington under an agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers.

After DNA testing in 2014 showed that the man was more
related to current Native-Americans than any other current population group,
Congress

passed legislation to turn over the remains to a coalition
of tribes, who buried them in 2017. Tribes Lay Remains of Kennewick Man to

Rogers,

Status of Native American Remains, 60 B.C. L. Rev. 2447 ( 2019 ).

4 .The Supreme Court has been unsympathetic to claims
seeking protection for culturally significant property as a matter of
constitutional law. For

example, in _Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective
Ass’n_ , 485 U.S. 439 ( 1988 ), the Court rejected the claim that building a
road through an

Indian burial ground would violate the Free Exercise rights
of Native Americans. Can you explain why a majoritarian institution like
Congress would be

more solicitous of the rights of cultural minorities than a
court, which is supposed to be more sensitive to minority rights? Consider in
this regard _Navajo

Nation v. U.S. Forest Serv._ , 535 F. 3 d 1058 ( 9 th Cir.
2008 ), rejecting a challenge under NAGPRA to the practice of using recycled
water containing

minute quantities of human remains for snowmaking in ski
areas. Relying on _Lyng_ , the court observed that expansive interpretations of
tribal religious

claims could result in “ ‘ _de facto_ beneficial ownership
of some rather spacious tracts of public property.’ ” Id. at 1072 (quoting
_Lyng_ , 485 U.S. at 453 ).

For a variety of views, see, e.g., Ellen Adair Page, The
Scope of the Free Exercise Clause: _Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery
Protective Association_ ,

68 N.C. L. Rev. 410 , 421 ( 1990 ) (arguing for a stricter
judicial test); Joseph William Singer, Property and Coercion in Federal Indian
Law: The Conflict

between Critical and Complacent Pragmatism, 63 S. Cal. L.

Rev. 1821 ( 1990 ) (criticizing the version of pragmatism in
_Lyng_ for being too complacent and majority-oriented); Marcia Yablon, Property
Rights and

Sacred Sites: Federal Regulatory Responses to American
Indian Religious Claims on Public Land, 113 Yale L.J. 1623 ( 2004 ) (arguing
for administrative

rather than judicial protection).

5 .Similar issues of protection of indigenous communities
and their cultures arise in the intangible realm. Groups across the world have
sought

protection for traditional knowledge, which can range from
cultural practices and art to knowledge of the medicinal properties of plants.
Quite often

traditional knowledge does not fit into the categories of
intellectual property, and such rights and concerns about cultural
appropriations in general stand

in some tension with policies (sometimes reflected in the
law and sometimes not) favoring free use of information not covered by property
rights. See,

e.g., Trevor G. Reed, Fair Use as Cultural Appropriation,
109 Cal. L. Rev. 1373 ( 2021 ). Do museums have a duty not to digitize
indigenous cultural

materials before returning them to their home communities?
See Chad Westmoreland, An Analysis of the Lack of Protection for Intangible
Tribal

Cultural Property in the Digital Age, 106 Cal. L. Rev. 959 (
2018 ). Might not-quite-property regimes like equity and misappropriation
(International

News v. Associated Press, Chapter II) or restitution for
unjust enrichment (Chapter IV) do a better job of reconciling these
perspectives and preventing

injustice? See Ruth L. Okediji, Traditional Knowledge and
Private Law, in The Oxford Handbook of the New Private Law 427 (Andrew S. Gold
et al.

eds., 2021 ). Does the filtering of indigenous people’s
claims through another legal system disrespect that system? Could law defer to
some indigenous

custom in a fashion that federal law does with respect to
laws protecting cultural patrimony in other countries? See Matthew H. Birkhold,
The

Indigenous McClain Doctrine: A New Tool to Protect Cultural
Patrimony and the Right to Self-Determination, 97 Wash. U. L. Rev. 113 ( 2019
).

6 .Is it inherently paradoxical to deploy property law as a
means of protecting indigenous cultural heritage which is often regarded
(whether

accurately or not) as rejecting Western concepts of
property? Compare Naomi Mezey, The Paradoxes of Cultural Property, 107 Colum.
L. Rev. 2004

( 2007 ) (arguing that “the idea of property has so
colonized the idea of culture that there is not much culture left in cultural
property”) with Kristen A.

Carpenter, Sonia K. Katyal & Angela R. Riley, In Defense
of Property, 118 Yale L.J. 1022 ( 2009 ) (contending that this critique ignores
“major

theoretical developments in the broader field of property
law” that suggest a “stewardship model” of property as opposed to property as
an individual

entitlement).

7 .Although NAGPRA is unusual in prohibiting any attempt to
treat cultural patrimony as private property, restrictions on the use and
development

of culturally significant properties are more common. Many
cities, for example, have enacted historic preservation laws that limit the
ability of owners

of properties of cultural or historical significance to make
modifications to these properties. We will encounter a famous constitutional
challenge to the

New York City preservation ordinance in Chapter X.

Customary law can constitute a system of law. Consider the
following case, in which the court seeks to breathe new life into an indigenous

regime of customary law.

■ Before
SEKAQUAPTEWA, Chief Judge, and LOMAYESVA and ABBEY, Judges. * * * Appellant,
Ruth Smith, and Appellees, Joyce James, Darlene

Ahownewa, and Lorna Quamahongnewa, are enrolled members of
the Hopi Tribe from the Village of Hotevilla. Appellees are the

granddaughters of Martha Bolehongna, and the daughters of
Mollie Honeyestewa, and currently reside on the Hopi Reservation. (James lives
in

Kykotsmovi, and Quamahongnewa and Ahownewa live in
Hotevilla.) Appellant is the daughter of Martha Bolehongna. Appellant left the
Hopi

reservation in 1938 and now resides on the Yavapai–Apache
Reservation with her husband Ted Smith, the Yavapai–Apache tribal chairman.

---

At issue is a tract of farming land located within the
Village of Hotevilla upon which there are orchards and bean fields. The parties
disagree

about who has exclusive rights to use and occupy the land.
Appellant asserts that her father and he gave her the property in 1954 in an
oral

“will”. Appellees claim, however, that pursuant to Hopi
tradition, their mother, Mollie, got the land since she remained on the land
and cared for

her mother in her old age while Ruth Smith was “disowned” by
her mother and lost her rights to inherit the land because she married a
non-Hopi,

moved off the reservation, and failed to participate in Hopi
ceremonies. Consequently, Appellees argue that because they have assumed the
role

of caring for the land, rights to the land transferred to
them in accord with Hopi tradition. They further state that their uncle,
Stephen Albert,

affirmed their rights to the land because he told them that
Appellant had no rights.

This dispute came to the forefront when, in the summer of
1993, Appellant and her son placed metal fencing stakes on the property and, in

May of 1994, planted fruit trees on the property. Appellees
allege these modifications interfere with their use of the property and are
contrary to

the Hopi way. In a letter dated May 30, 1994, addressed to
Appellant’s husband, Appellees requested that Appellant remove the stakes. In

response, Appellant sought advice of counsel who wrote to
Appellees stating that Appellant had rights to the land and further informing

Appellees that if they “persisted in harassing” Appellant
she would be forced to take legal action.

On July 26, 1994, Appellees requested that the Village
resolve the dispute between the parties. Concurrently, Appellees filed a
Petition for a

Preliminary Injunction in the Hopi Tribal Court. On August
2, 1994,

#270

the Village Board of Directors requested that the Hopi
tribal court resolve the matter. Consequently, Petitioners amended their
petition to include

a Quiet Title action. Respondent answered with a
counterclaim requesting the court issue an order quieting Petitioners’ title.
After numerous

continuances, Petitioners filed their response to the
counterclaims.

On April 30, 1995 trial court judge ordered a hearing to be
held on the issue of ownership and relinquishment of land by female members of

Hotevilla who marry non-Hopis and live outside the
reservation for extended period of time. A trial was held on June 25, 1995, in
which both

parties presented evidence. However the hearing originally
scheduled for March 31, 1995 was not held until March 27, 1997 due to numerous

requests for continuances. At the hearing in the Village of
Hotevilla, the court took testimony concerning the custom and traditions of
Hotevilla

from witnesses selected by the parties.

On April 17, 1998 trial court entered “Findings and
Judgement” in the matter of James, et al. v. Smith, 94CIV0000019, finding for
the

Petitioners. On May 6 , 1998, Respondent’s counsel filed a
Notice of Appeal (hereinafter Notice) with the Hopi Tribal Court. The same day,

Respondent’s counsel filed her Notice of Withdrawal as
Attorney for Record. Two days later, Petitioners’ counsel also filed Notice of

Withdrawal as Counsel of Record. Both parties now proceed
pro per, without the assistance of counsel. * * *

Threshold Issue:

I.May the appellate court exercise jurisdiction over an
appeal where the brief has been filed late?

Assuming the court does have jurisdiction, the following
issues are raised:

II.May the trial court hold a fact-finding hearing before
ascertaining the applicable substantive law?

III.Did the trial court employ the proper procedures for
finding the village custom?

SYNOPSIS

The instant case attempts to resolve a land dispute between
family members in the village of Hotevilla. Appellees requested that this court

dismiss the pending appeal because Appellant did not file
her brief within 30 days of filing notice. However, this court has substantial
discretion

to accept late briefs under the terms of Rule 37(i).
Therefore, we choose to deny Appellees’ motion and exercise jurisdiction over
the appeal.

The trial court properly sought to incorporate customary law
into its decision-making process by holding a hearing on village custom.

Although the trial court performed wonderfully in the
absence of guidelines for conducting such a hearing, there are two reasons that

#271

make this court unable to uphold the trial court’s decision.
First, and foremost, the court held the fact-finding hearing before conducting
the

hearing at the village to ascertain village practice. This
unfortunately may result in unfairness to one or both parties since, without
knowing the

legal standard, the parties cannot put forth evidence to
adequately support their claims. Furthermore, the trial court did not apply
procedures

appropriate to a hearing to find village customary law. The
trial court should have allowed the village an opportunity to propose witnesses
for the

hearing on village custom, and should have allowed the
parties an opportunity to introduce further questions about village custom
after the initial

testimony.

Therefore, it is the judgement of this court that the case
be remanded back to the trial court for two separate procedures: first, to hold
a new

hearing to ascertain village practice with respect to
resolution of disputes about inheritance of farm land and, second, to hold a
new trial where

parties may present evidence after the establishment of the
legal standard. The court acknowledges that this remand will delay a result for
both

the parties. Thus the tribal court may not be the best forum
available for dispute resolution of this nature. The parties are free to seek a
settlement

by seeking an arbitrator to whom the parties are willing to
submit their situation. If they agree to be bound by such a decision, they can
then seek

certification of that decision from the trial court.

DISCUSSION

---

II.The Trial Court Decision Cannot be Upheld because it
Contains Procedural Errors that Affected the Outcome.

It was necessary for the trial court to inquire into and
apply village customary law and practice in the instant case because of the
unique

history of the Village of Hotevilla. Hotevilla came to be as
a result of the split at Old Oraibi in 1906. The establishment of Hotevilla and
other

communities on Third Mesa, affected the traditional “clan
lands” system in operation at Old Oraibi because the split did not necessarily
fall along

clan lines. Mischa Titiev, OLD ORABI: A STUDY OF THE HOPI
INDIANS OF THIRD MESA (1944): 88–89. Under the clan lands system, inheritance
of

land was traditionally matrilineal, but after the split at
Oraibi, inheritance could sometimes be patriline. See Peter M. Whiteley,
RETHINKING HOPI

ETHNOGRAPHY (1998): 62. Furthermore, with clan lands the
fields were always the woman’s but with the establishment of these new
villages, men

came to have different rights in land. See id. at 62, 65.
Because traditional systems of clan lands probably do not govern this dispute,
it was

necessary for the court to apply Village custom.

The Appellate Court of the Hopi Tribe has subject matter
jurisdiction to hear appeals from final judgements and orders of the Hopi
Tribal

Court. See Ordinance 21, § 1.2.5. In an exercise of this
jurisdiction,

#272

we have reviewed the trial court record and conclude that
the trial court’s decision cannot be upheld due to procedural errors.

A. Because the Trial Court held a Fact–Finding Trial before
the Hearing on Village Custom, the Parties Did not Know the

Applicable Law and therefore Were Unable to Present
Substantial Evidence to Support their Claim.

In the absence of prior case or statutory law to inform the
parties of the legal standard, the court is required to hold a hearing to find
the law

before it holds a trial-type hearing where evidence is
presented. Because this was not done in this case, the facts presented at the
trial in April

1995 cannot serve as evidence to support a finding on behalf
of either party.

The parties presented evidence supporting their claims of
right to the land in question at a trial, before the trial judge on June 29,
1995.

However, a hearing to determine the customary law pertaining
to the parties’ rights was not held until nearly two years later, in March
1997. See

(F.J., at 1). This was a procedural error on the part of the
trial court because, without an established legal principle, parties are unable
to construct

coherent arguments or select the evidence that will support
their case since they are forced to speculate as to what the law is. Forcing
this

speculation is not in the interest of the tribal courts or
the parties. Consequently, a new fact-finding hearing is required.

B. The Procedures Used at the Hearing Did Not Provide the
Proper Forum for Ascertaining Village Custom.

The trial court properly held a hearing at the village
level, and the manner in which it conducted the hearing should be commended.
The

non-adversarial nature facilitated testimony from witnesses
and emphasized the purpose of finding the law, not facts. However, because the

village was not involved in the selection of witnesses and
the parties were not permitted to submit additional questions following the
initial

testimony, the hearing at the village did not provide a
sufficient forum for ascertaining village custom.

Article VII of the Hopi Constitution states that
“[a]ssignment of use of farming lands... within the established village
holdings of...

Hotevilla... shall be made by each village according to
established custom.” Hopi Constitution, Article VII § 1. Pursuant to Article
VII, the trial

court properly held a hearing to ascertain the village
custom regarding rights to farming land acquired by use and inheritance.
However, because

the Village of Hotevilla waived its jurisdiction, the Tribal
Court should have given the Village an opportunity to propose witnesses for the

hearing.

The non-adversarial nature of the hearing was also proper
since many elders might be fearful of undergoing cross-examination. An

adversarial atmosphere would not foster village
participation in these hearings. However, the parties should have been afforded
an opportunity

#273

to request further questions after the initial testimony in
order to ensure there are not substantial gaps in the law being found. These
procedural

errors necessitate a new hearing to find the law.

III.The Case is Remanded back to the Trial Court for New
Findings of Law and Fact.

In light of the procedural and substantive errors, this case
should be remanded back to the trial court for a new hearing on village custom

and a new opportunity to present evidence at a fact-finding
trial.

---

B. This Court will Pronounce Procedures for the Trial Court
to Employ when Conducting Hearings to Find the Law of the Village.

(1)Either Party or the Judge, Sua Sponte, May Request a
Hearing Where Custom is Relevant and not “Proven”

The rule remains that a party wanting to use village custom
as a legal standard must “give notice to the other party and the court through

pleadings or other written notice”. Hopi Indian Credit Ass’n
v. Thomas (HICA), AP–001–84 (1996), at 5–6. HICA required that parties “prove”

the existence of the custom and state its relevance to the
issue before the court by referring to precedent, treatises that are accepted
by the

community, judicial notice, or affidavits of appropriate
persons. Id., at 6. However, “proving” custom presents difficulty where there
is great

diversity among the practices of each village and there is
no precedent in the tribal court. Consequently, judicial notice will not
generally be

available. See HICA, at 6 (“a court may dispense with proof
of the existence of a Hopi custom, tradition or culture if it finds... [it] to
be

generally known and accepted within the Hopi Tribe”); See
also (Amend. Petition) and (Answer) (presenting different claims about
Hotevilla

custom). In these instances, a hearing is the proper way to
find the law.

(2)Notice shall be given to the parties and the Village to
allow participation in the selection of witnesses.

The first step in the special hearing process is Notice. The
Court should notice the village and the parties as to the hearing and its
purpose,

offer guidance as to the kinds of witnesses it seeks, and
explain in detail the narrow purpose of a fact-finding hearing to find
customary law.

Depending on the specific law sought, the judge should try
to provide guidance to the Village and the parties for choosing their
witnesses. The

parties and the Village should then submit a list of
potential witnesses along with explanations of the reason for their inclusion
on the list, and the

type of testimony they can offer. Although the trial judge
should give deference to the village’s selection of witnesses, the judge should
exercise

discretion in approving the final list. * * *

#274

IV.The Parties May Choose to Settle Out of Court and the
Tribal Court would Encourages Such a Resolution.

Although these parties have brought this dispute before the
court, we acknowledge that there are alternatives for these parties to resolve
this

complex dispute. Clearly, the tribal courts must resolve
these disputes when brought them, but the intersection of law, Hopi tribal
court

procedure, village authority, and tradition is very
complicated.

Settlement between the parties may expedite resolution of
this matter. First, a mediator can facilitate compromise but the court can only

issue the remedies requested by the parties. Second,
mediation may result in a quicker decision since a settlement need only be
certified, and

hearings and appeals may not repeat over and over as they
may in this case. Both of these considerations would benefit the parties in
light of the

frustrations expressed by Appellant and Appellees as to the
lengthy decision-making in this dispute. * * *

■
Concurring Opinion, LOMAYESVA, J.

I write to express my agreement with the opinions in parts
II and III, but write to comment on the decision in Part I. Although I concur
in

result, I am disturbed by the undefined nature of this
court’s discretion. I believe the nature and the substance of the merits
involved in this court

raises substantial issues of Hopi law. Further, I believe
the pro per status of the Appellant suggest some relaxation of rigid procedural
rules. I

suggest this because legal procedural rules are based upon
Western precepts, which often clashes with non-Western Hopi sensibilities. Yet,

discretion unbound invites uncertainty and disturbs one’s
reliance upon established law.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1. _Smith v. James_ is a landmark in the effort to
   revitalize Hopi customary law. While there was a time when the common law
   itself was considered

the general custom of all of society, the role of custom in
the common law is thought to be more modest than it once was. By contrast,
custom is at the

core of the Hopi system. For an account of how judges and
others are using ancient custom in a new way to create a legal system for the
Hopi tribe, see

Justin B. Richland, Arguing with Tradition: The Language of
Law in Hopi Tribal Court ( 2008 ).

2 .The land at issue in the case is in Hotevilla, a Hopi
village which split from another Hopi village, Old Oraibi, in 1906. Hotevilla
allowed for

more individual property in men than in Oraibi. In Oraibi
property would descend to women, who would in turn be obligated to cook in
tribal

ceremonies. So the parties are arguing two different sets of
customs. If tribal custom makes distinctions (like the gender-based ones in the
principle case)

that state and federal law would not (or could not) make,
how intrusive or deferential should federal law be? For similar tensions in
Ethiopian land

registration, see Ayano, supra, 52 Law & Soc’y Rev. at
1060.

3 .Overt invocations of custom are less common in American
property law than they once were. Henry E. Smith, Custom in American Property

Law: A Vanishing Act, 48 Tex. Int’l L.J. 507 ( 2013 ). As we
saw in a previous case, _Ghen v. Rich_ , nineteenth-century courts deferred to
possessory

customs of the whaling industry, except when the customs
were unreasonable or might disturb the expectations of non-whalers. In recent
times, the most

famous and high-stakes invocation of custom has been in
cases about the public’s access to beaches. We delve into this issue in _State
of Oregon ex rel.

Thornton v. Hay_ , later in this Chapter. The common law
featured a set of criteria for judges to use in deciding whether to treat a
custom as law—criteria

famously expounded by Blackstone. These included specific
criteria, like longstandingness and reasonableness, and general ones: the
custom can be

either society-wide or apply within a defined community. 1
William Blackstone, Commentaries * 67. Some see tribal custom as closely
fitting this

description. Gloria Valencia-Weber, Tribal Courts: Custom
and Innovative Law, 24 N.M. L. Rev. 225 , 246 – 47 ( 1994 ). Others see great
challenges in

rescuing what remains of custom for some tribes and see
value in avoiding Americanized elements. Christine Zuni, Strengthening What
Remains, 7

Kan. J.L. & Pub. Pol’y 17 ( 1997 ); see generally
Elizabeth A. Reese, The Other American Law, 73 Stan. L. Rev. 555 ( 2021 ).
Reviving custom raises

these and many other questions, such as the role, if any,
anthropological theories should play in the process. Pat Sekaquaptewa, Key
Concepts in the

Finding, Definition and Consideration of Custom Law in
Tribal Lawmaking, 32 Am. Indian L. Rev. 319 ( 2008 ).

up or reinforce those communities themselves, as in Smith v. James. Modern

```

market societies may seem to have less place for community
and correspondingly a diminished reliance on custom. But is that true? New
kinds of

community are arising online. Are these real or spurious
communities? Either way, can you think of customs that have arisen online, to
which you may

feel yourself bound. Why is it that visiting a website in
violation of terms of service, especially clickwrap boilerplate, does not seem
like a “trespass,”

but using a stolen password, systematic guessing of
passwords, or other hacking activities definitely does? Orin S. Kerr, Norms of
Computer Trespass,

116 Colum. L. Rev. 1143 ( 2016 ). As you work through the
cases in this book, ask yourself how important a role custom plays. Could one
possibly

understand how possession works without an understanding of
customs of everyday life and of various specialized contexts?

5 .Interestingly, community is important to the success of
businesses based on non-fungible tokens (NFTs), digital assets that are
verified as

authentic by blockchain technology (for instance,
demonstrating that the holder owns the original version of some digital
artwork). Blockchain is an

impersonal digital leger of transactional “blocks” of data,
in which the leger incorporates all previous blocks and is cryptographically
protected against

manipulation. The most obvious applications include
cryptocurrencies and secure transfers of assets (for example in connection with
land transactions,

see Chapter VIII), which benefit from the public and
impersonal nature of the technology. However, more elaborate use of NFTs go
beyond “virtual

deeds” to make NFTs programmable. This makes possible
entirely new kinds of assets, from digital “sports moments” trading cards to
membership in

clubs that have grown up around NFTs (like “Bored Ape”),
which require the ongoing interest and engagement of a relevant community. See
Steve

Kaczynski & Scott Duke Kominers, How NFTs Create Value,
Harv. Bus. Rev. (Nov. 19 , 2021 ), https://hbr.org/ 2021 / 11 /
how-nfts-create-value. For a

discussion of the difficulties in classifying digital assets
under current law—are they commodities, securities, currencies, assets, or
something other than

property?—and how property law might define such assets for
legal purposes, see João Marinotti, Tangibility As Technology, 37 Ga. St. U. L.
Rev. 671

( 2021 ).

### D. PUBLIC RIGHTS

In the previous sections, we considered whether there are
certain things that are too private or person-related, or too connected to

community, to be objects of ownership as private property
(or as property at all). In this section, we take up something of the opposite
question—

whether there are certain resources that are too “public” to
be parceled out into private ownership. In other words, is there a category of
resources

that should be regarded as “inherently public,” and hence
should remain accessible only on equal terms to all members of the society?

#277

### 1 .THE NAVIGATION SERVITUDE

a.NAVIGABLE WATERS

The resource with the longest historical claim to being
inherently public is navigable water. Under Roman law, according to Justinian’s

Institutes , “all of these things are by natural law common
to all: air, flowing water, the sea and, consequently, the shores of the sea.”
Institutes

2.1.1–5 (J. Moyle trans., 5th ed. 1913). Bracton, writing in
the mid-thirteenth century, borrowed from Justinian’s Institutes and claimed
that at

common law the sea and seashore were common to all. Henry de
Bracton, On the Laws and Customs of England 39–40 (Samuel E. Thorne

trans., 1968 ). Eventually, English law gave distinct
treatment to “navigable waters” in four ways: (1) any member of the public had
the right to

travel by vessel on a body of water that was navigable; (2)
any member of the public had the right to fish in a body of water that was
navigable;

(3) the land beneath navigable water was presumptively owned
by the Crown; and (4) disputes arising out of incidents on navigable water were

decided by the Royal Admiralty Courts rather than the
common-law courts. See Daniel J. Hulsebosch, Writs to Rights: “Navigability”
and the

Transformation of the Common Law in the Nineteenth Century,
23 Cardozo L. Rev. 10 49, 1055, 1066–67 (2002); James R. Rasband, The

Disregarded Common Parentage of the Equal Footing and Public
Trust Doctrines, 32 Land & Water L. Rev. 1 (1997).

Thus, under English law the King as sovereign owned and
controlled all navigable waters within the realm (as opposed to the high seas,

which no one owned), and presumptively owned the land
beneath navigable waters. Navigable waters, however, were narrowly defined in

English law to mean those waters subject to the ebb and flow
of the tides. Consequently, submerged land under rivers and lakes not affected
by

the tides was subject to private ownership. Absent a grant
to the contrary, the owner of land bordering on a nonnavigable body of water
owned

the submerged land to the thread of the current or center
line of the river or lake on which the land abutted. Also, the sovereign’s
ownership and

control of navigable waters was qualified by important
public rights ( jus publicum ). All waters, whether tidal or not, were subject
to a general

public easement of free navigation. The King was powerless
to interfere with this right. Moreover, private owners of waters that were
nontidal

but navigable in fact could not interfere with public
navigation, provided those wishing to traverse such waters could obtain access
without

trespassing. The right to fish was also understood to be a
public right that could not be defeated with respect to tidal waters and the
beds of tidal

waters, although owners of land under non-tidal waters could
restrict access for fishing.

Adapting these understandings to the American context was
complicated by the division of authority between the federal government and

the states. The U.S. Constitution gave Congress authority to

#278

“regulate Commerce with foreign nations, and among the
several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3.
“Commerce” in

1789 took place largely through vessels plying navigable
waterways, and so the Constitution appeared to contemplate a federal role in
preserving

and enhancing navigation. The Constitution also extended the
judicial power of the federal courts to “all Cases of admiralty and maritime

Jurisdiction.” Id. art. III, § 2. This too suggested that
the federal courts were to assume the jurisdiction historically exercised by
the Royal Courts

of Admiralty over disputes arising on navigable waters.

These expectations were eventually vindicated. Congress
conferred admiralty jurisdiction on the federal courts in the Judiciary Act of
1789.

At first, this jurisdiction was understood to extend only to
disputes arising out of navigable waters as defined by English law—that is, to
disputes

arising out of waters subject to the ebb and flow of the
tides. See The Steam-Boat Thomas Jefferson, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 428 (1825). But
in

1851, in a dramatic reversal, the Court overruled this
decision and held that the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts was not
limited to tidal

waters but extended to all waters that are navigable in
fact. The Propeller Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 53 U.S. (12 How.) 443 (1851).
The Court

noted that in England, with its long coast line and short
rivers, the equation of navigable waters with tidal waters did not do great
violence to

commercial realities. On the North American continent, by
contrast, a large number of waterways are not tidal yet are navigable in fact,
including

the Great Lakes and rivers like the Ohio and the
Mississippi. By 1851 it was clear that these waterways would play a vital role
in the

development of American commerce, and therefore a broader
definition of navigable waters was needed.

The federal role in preserving free navigation under the
Commerce Clause emerged more slowly. The first decisive step was the Supreme

Court’s decision in Gibbons v. Ogden , 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1
(1824), where the Court invalidated a monopoly charter granted by the New York

legislature to operate steamboats between New York City and
New Jersey. Chief Justice Marshall wrote that the word “commerce” in the

Constitution “comprehends, and has been always understood to
comprehend, navigation within its meaning; and a power to regulate navigation,

is as expressly granted, as if that term had been added to
the word ‘commerce.’ ” Id. at 193. Gibbons established that Congress has
plenary

authority to legislate on the subject of commercial
navigation. Soon, the commerce power came to be understood as self-executing,
even in the

absence of legislation by Congress. Thus, for example, in
Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co. , 54 U.S. (1 3 How.) 518
(1851), the

Court held that the federal courts, on the authority of the
Commerce Clause and without any implementing legislation, could issue an
injunction

directing that a low-lying bridge be raised in order to
prevent undue interference with navigation on the Ohio River. Although Congress
could

intercede and revise such decisions (as it did with respect

#279

to the Wheeling Bridge, see Pennsylvania v. Wheeling &
Belmont Bridge Co., 59 U.S. (18 How.) 421 (1855)), the Court deemed the
principle of

free navigation too important to await implementing
legislation from Congress.

Decisions like those involving the Wheeling Bridge
eventually crystallized into the notion that the Commerce Clause, of its own
force,

imposes a “navigation servitude” on all waters of the United
States that are in fact navigable. Under this navigation servitude, no state

government, and no individual or corporation acting under
the authority of state law, has the power to obstruct or interfere with the
public’s right

to free use of waterways for transportation. See, e.g.,
United States v. Rands, 389 U.S. 121, 122–2 3 (1967); FPC v. Niagara Mohawk
Power

Corp., 347 U.S. 239, 249 (1954); Scranton v. Wheeler, 179
U.S. 141, 156–57 (1900).

The question of who has title to submerged land beneath
navigable waters has followed a convoluted path in the United States. With
respect

to tidal lands, the Supreme Court held in Martin v. Waddell
, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 367 (1842), that the original colonies succeeded to the
position of

English Crown with respect to the ownership of tidal lands.
In Pollard v. Hagan, 44 U.S. (3 How.) 212 (1845), this understanding with
respect to

tidal lands was extended to states later admitted to the
Union, based on the “equal footing” language contained in their statehood
grants. But with

respect to lands beneath waters that were not tidal but
navigable in fact, the states carved out a variety of positions. Some followed
English law,

and recognized private ownership of such lands; others
decided that the state government owned such lands; still others split the
difference,

saying that private ownership applied to land under rivers
but state ownership applied to land under lakes (especially large ones). In
Shively v.

Bowlby , 152 U.S. 1 (1894), the Court decided that different
states were free to take different positions on the ownership of land beneath

navigable but nontidal waters.

Today, it can be said that American law recognizes something
similar to the jus publicum of English common law, but it is grounded in the

Commerce Clause rather than in any conception of inherently
public property rights. Congress has consistently endorsed the idea that the

navigable waters of the United States shall remain open to
public navigation. Perhaps most prominently, the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1890

provided that “the creation of any obstruction, not
affirmatively authorized by law, to the navigable capacity of any waters, in
respect of which

the United States has jurisdiction, is hereby prohibited.”
26 Stat. 426, 454 (1890). The Act delegated authority to the U.S. Army, acting
through

its Corps of Engineers, to take legal action against, and if
necessary remove, such obstructions to navigable waters. Similarly, the
Submerged

Lands Act, which confirmed states’ right to determine the
title to the submerged lands under navigable waters within their borders,
Congress

reserved to the federal government “all its navigation
servitude

#280

and rights in and powers of regulation and control of said
lands and navigable waters for the constitutional purposes of commerce,
navigation,

national defense, and international affairs, all of which
shall be paramount to, but shall not be deemed to include, proprietary rights
of

ownership... .” 67 Stat. 32, 43 U.S.C. § 1314 (1953).

This does not mean that the division of authority between
the federal government and the states is clear. The concept of “navigable
waters”

generally defines the scope of the authority of the federal
government. This was ambiguously defined in the Clean Water Act to mean “the
waters

of the United States.” 33 U.S.C. § 1362(7). The Supreme
Court has struggled (without success) to specify what that means. See Rapanos
v.

United States, 547 U.S. 715, 730–39 (2006) (plurality
opinion of Scalia, J.) (“waters” refers to relatively permanent, standing, or
continuously

flowing bodies of water); id. at 759–8 7 (Kennedy, J.,
concurring) (“waters” should be defined in light of the pollution control
purposes of the

Act); Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps
of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159 (2001) (“navigable waters” cannot be defined so

broadly as to exceed the power of Congress under the
Commerce Clause).

b.NAVIGABLE AIRSPACE

In United States v. Causby , 328 U.S. 256 (1946), the
Supreme Court held that the principles of federal control over navigable
waterways

extend to navigable airspace. Causby, a chicken farmer in
Greensboro, North Carolina, had the misfortune of having a military airport
built next

to his farm during the run up to World War II. The testimony
showed that roaring military planes passed as low as 83 feet over his property,

which so frightened the chickens that some of them flew into
the walls and killed themselves, while others stopped laying eggs. Causby sued
the

United States, claiming that the overflights were a taking
of his air rights under the ad coelum doctrine. In an opinion by Justice
Douglas, the

Court agreed that there had been a taking, but only because
the overflights caused a direct injury to Causby’s use and enjoyment of the
land. The

Court took pains to emphasize that the federal government
has ample authority to assure that navigable airspace remains a public
resource:

The United States relies on the Air Commerce Act of 1926, 44
Stat. 568, 49 U.S.C. § 171 et seq., as amended by the Civil

Aeronautics Act of 193 8, 52 Stat. 973, 49 U.S.C. § 401 et
seq. Under those statutes the United States has “complete and exclusive

national sovereignty in the air space” over this country. 49
U.S.C. § 176(a). They grant any citizen of the United States “a public right

of freedom of transit in air commerce through the navigable
air space of the United States.” 49 U.S.C. § 403. And “navigable air

space” is defined as “airspace above the minimum safe
altitudes of flight prescribed by the Civil Aeronautics Authority.” 49 U.S.C.

§ 180. And it is provided that

#281

“such navigable airspace shall be subject to a public right
of freedom of interstate and foreign air navigation.” Id. It is, therefore,

argued that since these flights were within the minimum safe
altitudes of flight which had been prescribed, they were an exercise of the

declared right of travel through the airspace. The United
States concludes that when flights are made within the navigable airspace

without any physical invasion of the property of the
landowners, there has been no taking of property. * * *

It is ancient doctrine that at common law ownership of the
land extended to the periphery of the universe— Cujus est solum ejus

est usque ad coelum. But that doctrine has no place in the
modern world. The air is a public highway, as Congress has declared. Were

that not true, every transcontinental flight would subject
the operator to countless trespass suits. Common sense revolts at the idea. To

recognize such private claims to the airspace would clog
these highways, seriously interfere with their control and development in the

public interest, and transfer into private ownership that to
which only the public has a just claim. * * *

The airplane is part of the modern environment of life, and
the inconveniences which it causes are normally not compensable

under the Fifth Amendment. The airspace, apart from the
immediate reaches above the land, is part of the public domain. We need not

determine at this time what those precise limits are.
Flights over private land are not a taking, unless they are so low and so
frequent as

to be a direct and immediate interference with the enjoyment
and use of the land.

Id. at 260–61, 266 (footnotes omitted). As noted in
connection with the Hinman case (Chapter I), the Court’s characterization of
the ad coelum

doctrine as obsolete is best viewed as a piece of rhetorical
excess. But there remain significant questions of how to apply or modify ad
coelum in

light of the relatively recent possibility of overflights by
aircraft. See generally Stuart Banner, Who Owns the Sky?: The Struggle to
Control

Airspace from the Wright Brothers On (2008).

After the Causby decision, navigable airspace in the United
States has assumed roughly the same status as navigable waterways: Federal

law trumps any attempt by the states or private property
owners to interfere with free public navigation; federal law plays a paramount
role in

regulating the use of and access to the navigable airspace;
and federal policy has been to encourage public access to navigable airspace.

### 2 .THE PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE

#### Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Illinois

```



Supreme Court of the United States, 1892.



146 U.S. 387.



```

■ MR.
JUSTICE FIELD delivered the opinion of the court. This suit was commenced on
the 1st of March, 1883, in a circuit court of Illinois, by an

information or bill in equity filed by the attorney general
of the state, in the name of its people, against the Illinois Central Railroad
Company, a

corporation created under its laws, and against the city of
Chicago. * * *

The object of the suit is to obtain a judicial determination
of the title of certain lands on the east or lake front of the city of Chicago,
situated

between the Chicago river and Sixteenth street, which have
been reclaimed from the waters of the lake, and are occupied by the tracks,
depots,

warehouses, piers, and other structures used by the railroad
company in its business, and also of the title claimed by the company to the

submerged lands, constituting the bed of the lake, lying
east of its tracks, within the corporate limits of the city, for the distance
of a mile, and

between the south line of the south pier near Chicago river,
extended eastwardly, and a line extended in the same direction from the south
line of

lot 21 near the company’s roundhouse and machine shops. The
determination of the title of the company will involve a consideration of its
right

to construct, for its own business, as well as for public
convenience, wharves, piers, and docks in the harbor. * * *

The city of Chicago is situated upon the southwestern shore
of Lake Michigan * * * For a long time after the organization of the city, its

harbor was the Chicago river, a small, narrow stream opening
into the lake * * * ; and in it the shipping arriving from other ports of the
lake and

navigable waters was moored or anchored, and along it were
docks and wharves. The growth of the city in subsequent years, in population,

business, and commerce, required a larger and more
convenient harbor * * *

#283

Figure 3-2

Chicago Lakefront, Late 1880s

#284

The case proceeds upon the theory and allegation that the
defendant the Illinois Central Railroad Company has, without lawful authority,

encroached, and continues to encroach, upon the domain of
the state, and its original ownership and control of the waters of the harbor
and of the

lands thereunder, upon a claim of rights acquired under a
grant from the state * * *

The state prays a decree establishing and confirming its
title to the bed of Lake Michigan, and exclusive right to develop and improve
the

harbor of Chicago by the construction of docks, wharves,
piers, and other improvements, against the claim of the railroad company that
it has an

absolute title to such submerged lands by the act of 1869 *

We proceed to consider the claim of the railroad company to
the ownership of submerged lands in the harbor, and the right to construct such

wharves, piers, docks, and other works therein as it may
deem proper for its interest and business. The claim is founded upon the third
section of

the act of the legislature of the state passed on the 16th
of April, 1869, the material part of which is as follows:

Sec. 3. * * * [A]ll the right and title of the state of
Illinois in and to the submerged lands constituting the bed of Lake Michigan,

and lying east of the tracks and breakwater of the Illinois
Central Railroad Company, for a distance of one mile, and between the south

line of the south pier extended eastwardly and a line
extended eastward from the south line of lot twenty-one, south of and near to
the

roundhouse and machine shops of said company, in the south
division of the said city of Chicago, are hereby granted in fee to the said

Illinois Central Railroad Company, its successors and
assigns: provided, however, that the fee to said lands shall be held by said

company in perpetuity, and that the said company shall not
have power to grant, sell, or convey the fee to the same, and that all gross

receipts from use, profits, leases, or otherwise, of said
lands, or the improvements thereon, or that may hereafter be made thereon,
shall

form a part of the gross proceeds, receipts, and income of
the said Illinois Central Railroad Company, upon which said company shall

forever pay into the state treasury, semiannually, the per
centum provided for in its charter, in accordance with the requirements of said

charter: and provided, also, that nothing herein contained
shall authorize obstructions to the Chicago harbor, or impair the public right

of navigation, nor shall this act be construed to exempt the
Illinois Central Railroad Company, its lessees or assigns, from any act of

the general assembly which may be hereafter passed,
regulating the rates of wharfage and dockage to be charged in said harbor.

#* * *

#285

The act, if valid and operative to the extent claimed,
placed under the control of the railroad company nearly the whole of the
submerged

lands of the harbor, subject only to the limitations that it
should not authorize obstructions to the harbor, or impair the public right of
navigation,

or exclude the legislature from regulating the rates of
wharfage or dockage to be charged. With these limitations, the act put it in
the power of the

company to delay indefinitely the improvement of the harbor,
or to construct as many docks, piers, and wharves and other works as it might

choose, and at such positions in the harbor as might suit
its purposes, and permit any kind of business to be conducted thereon, and to
lease them

out on its own terms for indefinite periods. The inhibition
against the technical transfer of the fee of any portion of the submerged lands
was of

little consequence when it could make a lease for any
period, and renew it at its pleasure; and the inhibitions against authorizing
obstructions to

the harbor and impairing the public right of navigation
placed no impediments upon the action of the railroad company which did not
previously

exist. A corporation created for one purpose, the
construction and operation of a railroad between designated points, is by the
act converted into a

corporation to manage and practically control the harbor of
Chicago, not simply for its own purpose as a railroad corporation, but for its
own

profit generally.

The circumstances attending the passage of the act through
the legislature were on the hearing the subject of much criticism. As
originally

introduced, the purpose of the act was to enable the city of
Chicago to enlarge its harbor, and to grant to it the title and interest of the
state to

certain lands adjacent to the shore of Lake Michigan, on the
eastern front of the city, and place the harbor under its control; giving it
all the

necessary powers for its wise management. But during the
passage of the act its purport was changed. Instead of providing for the
cession of the

submerged lands to the city, it provided for a cession of
them to the railroad company. * * *

The question, therefore, to be considered, is whether the
legislature was competent to thus deprive the state of its ownership of the

submerged lands in the harbor of Chicago, and of the
consequent control of its waters; or, in other words, whether the railroad
corporation can

hold the lands and control the waters by the grant, against
any future exercise of power over them by the state.

That the state holds the title to the lands under the
navigable waters of Lake Michigan, within its limits, in the same manner that
the state

holds title to soils under tide water * * * we have already
shown; and that title necessarily carries with it control over the waters above
them,

whenever the lands are subjected to use. But it is a title
different in character from that which the state holds in lands intended for
sale. It is

different from the title which the United States hold in the
public lands which are open to pre-emption and sale. It is a title held in
trust for the

people of the state, that they may enjoy the navigation of
the waters,

#286

carry on commerce over them, and have liberty of fishing
therein, freed from the obstruction or interference of private parties. The
interest of the

people in the navigation of the waters and in commerce over
them may be improved in many instances by the erection of wharves, docks, and

piers therein, for which purpose the state may grant parcels
of the submerged lands; and, so long as their disposition is made for such
purpose, no

valid objections can be made to the grants. * * * But that
is a very different doctrine from the one which would sanction the abdication
of the

general control of the state over lands under the navigable
waters of an entire harbor or bay, or of a sea or lake. Such abdication is not
consistent

with the exercise of that trust which requires the
government of the state to preserve such waters for the use of the public. The
trust devolving

upon the state for the public, and which can only be
discharged by the management and control of property in which the public has an
interest,

cannot be relinquished by a transfer of the property. The
control of the state for the purposes of the trust can never be lost, except as
to such

parcels as are used in promoting the interests of the public
therein, or can be disposed of without any substantial impairment of the public
interest

in the lands and waters remaining. * * * A grant of all the
lands under the navigable waters of a state has never been adjudged to be
within the

legislative power; and any attempted grant of the kind would
be held, if not absolutely void on its face, as subject to revocation. The
state can no

more abdicate its trust over property in which the whole
people are interested, like navigable waters and soils under them, so as to
leave them

entirely under the use and control of private parties,
except in the instance of parcels mentioned for the improvement of the
navigation and use of

the waters, or when parcels can be disposed of without
impairment of the public interest in what remains, than it can abdicate its
police powers in

the administration of government and the preservation of the
peace. In the administration of government the use of such powers may for a
limited

period be delegated to a municipality or other body, but
there always remains with the state the right to revoke those powers and
exercise them in

a more direct manner, and one more conformable to its
wishes. So with trusts connected with public property, or property of a special
character,

like lands under navigable waters; they cannot be placed
entirely beyond the direction and control of the state.

The harbor of Chicago is of immense value to the people of
the state of Illinois, in the facilities it affords to its vast and constantly

increasing commerce; and the idea that its legislature can
deprive the state of control over its bed and waters, and place the same in the
hands of a

private corporation, created for a different purpose,—one
limited to transportation of passengers and freight between distant points and
the city,

—is a proposition that cannot be defended.

The area of the submerged lands proposed to be ceded by the
act in question to the railroad company embraces something more than 1,000

#287

acres, being, as stated by counsel, more than three times
the area of the outer harbor, and not only including all of that harbor, but
embracing

adjoining submerged lands, which will, in all probability,
be hereafter included in the harbor. It is as large as that embraced by all the

merchandise docks along the Thames at London; is much larger
than that included in the famous docks and basins at Liverpool; is twice that
of

the port of Marseilles, and nearly, if not quite, equal to
the pier area along the water front of the city of New York. And the arrivals
and clearings

of vessels at the port exceed in number those of New York,
and are equal to those of New York and Boston combined. Chicago has nearly 25
per

cent. of the lake carrying trade, as compared with the
arrivals and clearings of all the leading ports of our great inland seas. In
the year ending

June 30, 1886, the joint arrivals and clearances of vessels
at that port amounted to 22,096, with a tonnage of over 7,000,000; and in 1890
the

tonnage of the vessels reached nearly 9,000,000. As stated
by counsel, since the passage of the lake front act, in 1869, the population of
the city

has increased nearly 1,000,000 souls, and the increase of
commerce has kept pace with it. It is hardly conceivable that the legislature
can divest

the state of the control and management of this harbor, and
vest it absolutely in a private corporation. Surely an act of the legislature
transferring

the title to its submerged lands and the power claimed by
the railroad company to a foreign state or nation would be repudiated, without

hesitation, as a gross perversion of the trust over the
property under which it is held. So would a similar transfer to a corporation
of another state.

It would not be listened to that the control and management
of the harbor of that great city—a subject of concern to the whole people of
the state

—should thus be placed elsewhere than in the state itself.
All the objections which can be urged to such attempted transfer may be urged
to a

transfer to a private corporation like the railroad company
in this case.

Any grant of the kind is necessarily revocable, and the
exercise of the trust by which the property was held by the state can be
resumed at

any time. Undoubtedly there may be expenses incurred in
improvements made under such a grant, which the state ought to pay; but, be
that as it

may, the power to resume the trust whenever the state judges
best is, we think, incontrovertible. The position advanced by the railroad
company

in support of its claim to the ownership of the submerged
lands, and the right to the erection of wharves, piers, and docks at its
pleasure, or for its

business in the harbor of Chicago, would place every harbor
in the country at the mercy of a majority of the legislature of the state in
which the

harbor is situated.

We cannot, it is true, cite any authority where a grant of
this kind has been held invalid, for we believe that no instance exists where
the

harbor of a great city and its commerce have been allowed to
pass into the control of any private corporation. But the decisions are
numerous

which declare that such property is held by the state, by
virtue of its

#288

sovereignty, in trust for the public. The ownership of the
navigable waters of the harbor, and of the lands under them, is a subject of
public

concern to the whole people of the state. The trust with
which they are held, therefore, is governmental, and cannot be alienated,
except in those

instances mentioned, of parcels used in the improvement of
the interest thus held, or when parcels can be disposed of without detriment to
the

public interest in the lands and waters remaining. * * *

■ MR.
JUSTICE SHIRAS, with whom concurred MR. JUSTICE GRAY and MR. JUSTICE BROWN,
dissenting. * * * [We agree that the State cannot part,]

by contract, with her sovereign powers. The railroad company
takes and holds these lands subject at all times to the same sovereign powers
in the

state as obtain in the case of other owners of property. Nor
can the grant in this case be regarded as in any way hostile to the powers of
the

general government in the control of harbors and navigable
waters.

The able and interesting statement, in the opinion of the
majority, of the rights of the public in the navigable waters, and of the
limitation of

the powers of the state to part with its control over them,
is not dissented from. But its pertinency in the present discussion is not
clearly seen. It

will be time enough to invoke the doctrine of the
inviolability of public rights when and if the railroad company shall attempt
to disregard them.

Should the state of Illinois see in the great and unforeseen
growth of the city of Chicago and of the lake commerce reason to doubt the

prudence of her legislature in entering into the contract
created by the passage and acceptance of the act of 1869, she can take the
rights and

property of the railroad company in these lands by a
constitutional condemnation of them. So, freed from the shackles of an
undesirable contract,

she can make, as she expresses in her bill a desire to do, a
“more advantageous sale or disposition to other parties,” without offense to
the law of

the land. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Justice Field’s opinion seems to imply that the Lake
Front Act of 1869 conferred monopoly control over the Chicago harbor on a
private

railroad company. But this is not true, as is confirmed by
Map C reproduced from the record in the case (see Figure 3 - 2 ). At the time
of the grant, the

harbor of Chicago was the Chicago River, which was entered
from Lake Michigan in the center of the city. The grant of submerged land to
the Illinois

Central Railroad began at the south bank of the River and
ran from there in a southerly direction. What the Lake Front Act in fact
contemplated was that

the Illinois Central would construct and operate a new
“outer harbor” in the lake south of the river, which would supplement the
existing facilities in the

Chicago River. To be sure, this supplemental harbor would
make the railroad the largest operator of piers and wharfs in the Chicago area,
and its

facilities would have had a favored position by being
nearest the lake. But being the biggest and closest does not make one a
monopolist, and it is likely

that

```



289



```

plenty of competition would have remained to constrain the
pricing of the railroad for its harbor services. Justice Field was an ardent
free-marketeer, but

he was also a populist who was intensely suspicious of
special privileges and charters for corporations. See The Slaughter-House
Cases, 83 U.S. ( 16

Wall.) 36 , 83 ( 1873 ) (Field, J. dissenting); Paul Kens,
Justice Stephen Field: Shaping Liberty from the Gold Rush to the Gilded Age (
1997 ); Charles W.

McCurdy, Justice Field and the Jurisprudence of
Government-Business Relations: Some Parameters of Laissez-Faire
Constitutionalism, 1863 – 1897 , 61

J. Am. Hist. 970 , 973 ( 1975 ). The argument between
Justice Field and Justice Shiras in _Illinois Central_ has strong echoes of the
debate in _Charles River

Bridge v. Warren Bridge_ , Chapter X, where Chief Justice
Taney argues that corporate charters should be narrowly construed to avoid
conferring

monopoly privileges and Justice Story, in dissent, says that
corporate charters are property that can be modified only by paying just
compensation to the

owners.

2 .Further information about the background of the case may
be found in Joseph D. Kearney & Thomas W. Merrill, Lakefront: Public Trust
and

Private Rights in Chicago chs. 1 – 2 ( 2021 ). Three points
are especially noteworthy. First, the railroad’s motivations in seeking a grant
of the submerged

land of the lake in 1869 were largely defensive—to fend off
efforts by other groups to obtain a grant of these lands, which would have left
the railroad’s

existing improvements isolated by unfriendly forces. The
principal rival consortium was headed up by a Chicago lawyer named Melville
Fuller, who by

1892 was Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. This lends
additional significance to his recusal from the case, the stated ground for
which was that

he had served as counsel to the City of Chicago in the court
below. Second, no one in 1869 imagined that the State of Illinois had the
resources or

expertise to construct an outer harbor for Chicago.
Downstate legislators favored a grant to the Illinois Central, which did have
the resources and

expertise, because the revenues generated by a new harbor
operated by the railroad would have been subject to the seven percent gross
receipts tax that

was then applicable to all of the railroad’s in-state
operations, and this additional revenue could be spent by the legislature for
projects throughout the

state. Chicago-based legislators tended to favor a grant to
the City of Chicago, which would have allowed the aldermen of the City Council
to control

construction contracts and leases of harbor facilities, and
hence to enrich themselves and their friends. Third, the railroad was accused
for many years of

using corrupt means to procure the enactment of the Lake
Front Act, as is perhaps alluded to in the paragraph in the opinion about
alleged irregularities

in the passage of the Act. Although there is no hard
evidence of bribery of the legislature, the weight of the evidence suggests
that some type of

corruption did take place in 1869 , although, as noted
above, the motivation for the graft was largely defensive.

3 .The outer harbor contemplated by the Lake Front Act of
1869 was never built. Litigation over the grant and repeal kept the project
tied up into

the twentieth century, by which time commercial traffic on
the Great Lakes had begun to decline. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
eventually dredged

a harbor in the Calumet River and Lake at the southern
boundary of

```



290



```

Chicago, which soon supplanted the Chicago River as the
area’s principal port. The only commercial harbor facility of any significance
ever built in

Lake Michigan by the government was Navy Pier, which juts
into the lake just north of the Chicago River (see Figure 3 - 3 ). This was
never very

successful as a harbor facility; it is today leased out to
the commercial operator of a multi-use tourist attraction.

4 .What is the source of law for the trust obligation that
the Supreme Court identifies as constraining the disposition of public lands
under

navigable waters? Justice Field never says whether he is
applying federal law or state law in _Illinois Central_. In subsequent public
trust decisions, the

Supreme Court has consistently maintained that the doctrine
is grounded in state law. See, e.g., Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U.S. 1 ( 1894 );
Appleby v. City of

New York, 271 U.S. 364 ( 1926 ). This means that the states
have been free to adopt various understandings of the public trust doctrine.
Some, like

Illinois, continue to follow Justice Field’s theory that the
title to certain resources (like submerged land under navigable waters) is
impressed with a

governmental trust that can never be abandoned. Others, like
New York, treat the public trust as a kind of clear statement rule, requiring
that the

legislature speak explicitly before privatization of trust
resources can take place. Still others, like Wisconsin and Hawaii, have located
the public trust in

language in the state constitution. These divergent
understandings have implications for the resources covered by the trust and how
easy or hard it is to

modify the trust. See Thomas W. Merrill, The Public Trust
Doctrine: Some Jurisprudential Variations and their Implications, 38 Haw. L.
Rev. 261

( 2016 ).

5 .One implication of the public trust doctrine, as extended
by _Illinois Central_ to waters that are nontidal but navigable in fact, is
that privately-

owned fishing streams such as are found in England and
Scotland are

```

```

difficult, if not impossible, to establish in the U.S. For
example, in _Collins v. Gerhardt_ , 211 N.W. 115 (Mich. 1926 ), the defendant
was wading and

fishing in the Pine River, a fast-moving trout stream
accessible by no vessel larger than a canoe. The plaintiff, who owned the land
on both sides and the

bed of Pine River, sued the defendant for trespass. The
court held for the defendant: “From this it follows that the common-law
doctrine, viz., that the

right of fishing in navigable waters follows the ownership
of the soil, does not prevail in this state. It is immaterial who owns the soil
in our navigable

rivers. The trust remains. From the beginning the title was
impressed with this trust for the preservation of the public right of fishing
and other public

rights which all citizens enjoyed in tidal waters under the
common law.” Id. at 116. Is this declaration of an inalienable public right of
access to fishing

streams a blessing or a bane for the protection of fish
populations and habitats?

Transformation of the Public Trust Doctrine

The public trust doctrine led a quiet existence until 1970.
In that year, Professor Joseph Sax wrote a law review article arguing that the

doctrine could be employed as an effective tool for
environmental protection. See Joseph Sax, The Public Trust Doctrine in Natural
Resource

Law: Effective Judicial Intervention, 68 Mich. L. Rev. 471
(1970). Sax did not advocate a rigid rule against privatization of public
resources; he

was more concerned with developing new forms of public
participation and judicial oversight to act as a counterweight to capture of
state and

local legislatures by developers. The Illinois Central
decision, which Sax characterized as involving a massive giveaway of public
resources with

no public interest justification, featured prominently in
illustrating the dangers of government capture. The article proved to be
enormously

influential. It transformed the public trust from a doctrine
about public access to commercial navigation, into a doctrine about
preservation of

natural resources. For example, recent Illinois decisions
have applied the public trust doctrine to invalidate proposals to fill a
portion of Lake

Michigan for expansion of a steel plant, People ex rel.
Scott v. Chicago Park Dist., 360 N.E.2d 773 (Ill. 1976), and an expansion of
Loyola

University’s Lake Shore campus, see Lake Michigan Fed’n v.
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 742 F. Supp. 441 (N.D. Ill. 1990). Controversies

continue to arise. In 2016, a federal district court
declined to dismiss a public trust lawsuit seeking to block construction on the
lakefront of the

Lucas Museum of the Narrative Arts, designed to house
paraphernalia from the Star Wars movies. The legal impasse caused the project
to be

cancelled. Most recently, the Obama Presidential Center
proposal for Jackson Park survived a number of legal challenges, some based on
the

public trust. See Protect Our Parks, Inc. v. Chicago Park
Dist., 971 F.3d 722 (7th Cir. 2020), cert. denied sub nom. Protect Our Parks,
Inc. v. City

of Chicago, Illinois, 141 S. Ct. 2583 (2021) (holding that
plaintiffs lacked Article III standing on state public trust claim).

One question raised by this reorientation of the public
trust doctrine is whether the underlying premise of the doctrine—that title to
certain

#292

resources must remain in governmental hands—is necessarily
well designed to achieve preservationist ends. Although Illinois courts have
been

willing to block transfers of title to nongovernmental
entities like steel plants, private universities, and museums operated by
private foundations,

they have been much more willing to go along with
development projects where title remains in government hands. Thus, for
example, the courts

have upheld as consistent with the public trust the use of
parks for the construction of schools, Paepcke v. Public Building Commission of

Chicago, 263 N.E.2d 11 (Ill. 1970); the construction of a
massive convention center on landfill in the lake, Fairbank v. Stratton, 152
N.E.2d 569

(Ill. 1958); and the building of a large water filtration
plant in the lake, Bowes v. City of Chicago, 120 N.E.2d 15 (Ill. 1954). In its
most recent

decision, the Illinois Supreme Court rejected a challenge to
the radical reconstruction of Soldier Field on public trust land, designed to
keep the

Chicago Bears football team in Chicago. The court reasoned
that the public trust doctrine was not violated because fee simple title to
Soldier

Field remained in the Chicago Park District, even though the
Park District had entered into a 30-year renewable lease with the Bears. See
Friends

of the Parks v. Chicago Park District, 786 N.E.2d 161 (Ill.
2003).

Cumulatively, these decisions do not suggest that a doctrine
focused on legal title will consistently function to preserve natural resources

from development. Of course, the relevant question is a
comparative one: Is a rule that insists that certain resources remain titled in
the name of

the government more likely to work to preserve these
resources, compared to a rule that permits such resources to be transferred
entirely into

private hands? Absent the public trust doctrine, would the
Chicago lakefront be one long wall of condominiums?

Another question raised by the new preservationist thrust of
the public trust doctrine is whether this is consistent with principles of

democratic control over state-owned resources. In Illinois
Central , the public trust doctrine was used to uphold the state legislature’s
most recent

determination of the proper use of the bed of the lake. In
1873, the legislature repealed the 1869 grant to the railroad, restoring title
to the lake

bed in the State of Illinois; the Supreme Court rejected the
railroad’s claim of vested rights and upheld the repeal, reasoning that one
legislature

cannot tie the hands of another in determining the proper
disposition of public resources. The decision seems to be a vindication of the
principle

of democratic control of public resources. In some more
recent decisions, however, the public trust doctrine has been used to
invalidate projects,

despite all relevant publicly accountable governmental
bodies having signed off on the project and deemed it to be in the public
interest. See,

e.g., Lake Michigan Federation, supra. Courts of course
invalidate democratically-adopted policies when those policies violate
constitutions

(though constitutions are also democratically-adopted
instruments). But there is no obvious constitutional provision,

#293

either in the federal Constitution or in most state
constitutions, that authorizes the public trust doctrine. Does the public trust
doctrine suffer from

a democracy deficit? See William D. Araiza, Democracy,
Distrust, and the Public Trust: Process-based Constitutional Theory, the Public
Trust

Doctrine, and the Search for a Substantive Environmental
Value, 45 UCLA L. Rev. 385 (1997); Richard J. Lazarus, Changing Conceptions of

Property and Sovereignty in Natural Resources: Questioning
the Public Trust Doctrine, 71 Iowa L. Rev. 631, 649–50 (1986).

A third question concerns the scope of the doctrine.
Professor Sax and other enthusiasts for the public trust doctrine have
envisioned it as

applying not just to navigable waterways, but also to inland
parks and wilderness areas. Yet, a recent survey indicates that nearly all
decisions

enforcing the doctrine involve resources that have some
connection with navigable water. See Robin Kundis Craig, A Comparative Guide to
the

Eastern Public Trust Doctrines: Classifications of States,
Property Rights, and State Summaries, 16 Pa. St. Envtl. L. Rev. 1 (2007); Robin
Kundis

Craig, A Comparative Guide to Western States’ Public Trust
Doctrines, 37 Ecology L.Q. 53 (2010). In one controversial case, the California

Supreme Court used the public trust doctrine to abrogate
appropriative water rights in nonnavigable streams in order to prevent
ecological harms

from a decline in the water level of a lake fed by the
streams. National Audubon Society v. Superior Court of Alpine County, 658 P.2d
709 (Cal.

1983). But even there, the lake into which the streams
flowed, Mono Lake, was a navigable body of water. Although lower court
decisions in

California have applied the public trust doctrine to
wildlife, see Center for Biological Diversity, Inc. v. FPL Group, Inc., 83
Cal.Rptr.3d 588 (Cal.

Ct. App. 20 08), the California Supreme Court has indicated
that outside the context of water, any application of the public trust doctrine
must be

grounded in statute. See Environmental Protection and
Information Center v. California Department of Forestry & Fire Protection,
187 P.3d 888,

926 (Cal. 2008). What accounts for the reluctance of courts
to extend the public trust doctrine, at least in its common law incarnation,
beyond

navigable waterways?

Nearly 30% of the land mass of the United States is owned by
the federal government. Much of this land is “leftovers” that no one took

during the era when the federal public domain was open to
purchase and homestead claims. (With narrow exceptions, the Taylor Grazing Act
of

1934 closed the federal public domain to further private
appropriation.) But the federal public lands also include spectacular national
parks and

wilderness areas. The Supreme Court has occasionally spoken
of the federal lands as being held by the United States in “trust” for the
people.

See, e.g., Light v. United States, 220 U.S. 523, 537 (1911)
(upholding the creation of the National Forest System). Many states also hold
ordinary

lands in trust—for example, for support of schools—which are
not necessarily subject to the public trust doctrine. Jon A. Souder & Sally
K.

Fairfax, State Trust Lands: History, Management, and
Sustainable Use

#294

(1996). Should the 30% of the national land mass held by the
United States be subject to the public trust doctrine, as explicated in
Illinois

Central? Although commentators have occasionally advanced
this argument, see, e.g., Charles F. Wilkinson, The Public Trust Doctrine in
Public

Land Law, 14 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 269 (1980), to our knowledge
no federal appeals court has ever endorsed it. Why do you suppose the public

trust doctrine has more vitality with respect to state-owned
resources than it does with respect to federally-owned resources?

Richard Epstein has suggested that the public trust doctrine
should also apply to intellectual property rights whose period of protection
has

expired, allowing the material to enter the public domain.
Richard A. Epstein, Intellectual Property, Congressional Power, and the
Constitution:

The Dubious Constitutionality of the Copyright Term
Extension Act, 36 Loyola L.A. L. Rev. 123, 156–58 (2002). Epstein argues that
this would

discourage Congress from enacting retroactive extensions of
intellectual property right protections, at the behest of interest groups that
profit

from these rights.

■
GOODWIN, JUSTICE. William and Georgianna Hay, the owners of a tourist facility
at Cannon Beach, appeal from a decree which enjoins them

from constructing fences or other improvements in the
dry-sand area between the sixteen-foot elevation contour line and the ordinary
high-tide

line of the Pacific Ocean.

The issue is whether the state has the power to prevent the
defendant landowners from enclosing the dry-sand area contained within the

legal description of their ocean-front property. * * *

The defendant landowners concede that * * * all tideland
lying seaward of the ordinary, or mean high-tide line is a state recreation
area as

defined in ORS 390.720.^1

From the trial record, applicable statutes, and court
decisions, certain terms and definitions have been extracted and will appear in
this

opinion. A short glossary follows:

ORS 390.720 refers to the “ordinary” high-tide line, while
other sources refer to the “mean” high-tide line. For the purposes of this case
the

two lines will be considered to be the same. * * *

#295

The land area in dispute will be called the dry-sand area.
This will be assumed to be the land lying between the line of mean high tide
and

the visible line of vegetation.

The vegetation line is the seaward edge of vegetation where
the upland supports vegetation. It generally falls in the vicinity of the
sixteen

foot elevation contour line * * *

The extreme high-tide line and the highwater mark are
mentioned in the record, but will be treated as identical with the vegetation
line.

---

Below, or seaward of, the mean high-tide line, is the
state-owned foreshore, or wet-sand area, in which the landowners in this case
concede

the public’s paramount right, and concerning which there is
no justiciable controversy.

The only issue in this case, as noted, is the power of the
state to limit the record owner’s use and enjoyment of the dry-sand area, by

whatever boundaries the area may be described.

The trial court found that the public had acquired, over the
years, an easement for recreational purposes to go upon and enjoy the dry-sand

area, and that this easement was appurtenant to the wet-sand
portion of the beach which is admittedly owned by the state and designated as a

“state recreation area.”

Because we hold that the trial court correctly found in
favor of the state on the rights of the public in the dry-sand area, it follows
that the

state has an equitable right to protect the public in the
enjoyment of those rights by causing the removal of fences and other obstacles.

---

In order to explain our reasons for affirming the trial
court’s decree, it is necessary to set out in some detail the historical facts
which lead to

our conclusion.

The dry-sand area in Oregon has been enjoyed by the general
public as a recreational adjunct of the wet-sand or foreshore area since the

beginning of the state’s political history. The first
European settlers on these shores found the aboriginal inhabitants using the
foreshore for clam-

digging and the dry-sand area for their cooking fires. The
newcomers continued these customs after statehood. Thus, from the time of the
earliest

settlement to the present day, the general public has
assumed that the dry-sand area was a part of the public beach, and the public
has used the

dry-sand area for picnics, gathering wood, building warming
fires, and generally as a headquarters from which to supervise children or to
range

out over the foreshore as the tides advance and recede. In
the Cannon Beach vicinity, state and local officers have policed the dry sand,
and

municipal sanitary crews have attempted to keep the area
reasonably free from man-made litter.

Perhaps one explanation for the evolution of the custom of
the public to use the dry-sand area for recreational purposes is that the area
could

#296

not be used conveniently by its owners for any other
purpose. The dry-sand area is unstable in its seaward boundaries, unsafe during
winter

storms, and for the most part unfit for the construction of
permanent structures. While the vegetation line remains relatively fixed, the
western

edge of the dry-sand area is subject to dramatic moves
eastward or westward in response to erosion and accretion. For example,
evidence in the

trial below indicated that between April 1966 and August
1967 the seaward edge of the dry-sand area involved in this litigation moved
westward

180 feet. At other points along the shore, the evidence
showed, the seaward edge of the dry-sand area could move an equal distance to
the east in

a similar period of time.

Until very recently, no question concerning the right of the
public to enjoy the dry-sand area appears to have been brought before the
courts

of this state. The public’s assumption that the dry sand as
well as the foreshore was “public property” had been reinforced by early
judicial

decisions. See Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U.S. 1 (1894), which
affirmed Bowlby v. Shively, 30 P. 154 (Or. 1892). These cases held that
landowners

claiming under federal patents owned seaward only to the
“high-water” line, a line that was then assumed to be the vegetation line.

In 193 5, the United States Supreme Court held that a
federal patent conveyed title to land farther seaward, to the mean hightide
line. Borax

Consolidated, Ltd. v. Los Angeles, 296 U.S. 10 (1935). While
this decision may have expanded seaward the record ownership of upland

landowners, it was apparently little noticed by Oregonians.
In any event, the Borax decision had no discernible effect on the actual
practices of

Oregon beachgoers and upland property owners.

Recently, however, the scarcity of oceanfront building sites
has attracted substantial private investments in resort facilities. Resort
owners

like these defendants now desire to reserve for their paying
guests the recreational advantages that accrue to the dry-sand portions of
their deeded

property. Consequently, in 1967, public debate and political
activity resulted in legislative attempts to resolve conflicts between public
and

private interests in the dry-sand area:

ORS 390.610

(1)The Legislative Assembly hereby declares it is the public
policy of the State of Oregon to forever preserve and maintain the

sovereignty of the state heretofore existing over the
seashore and ocean beaches of the state from the Columbia River on the North to

the Oregon-California line on the South so that the public
may have the free and uninterrupted use thereof.

(2)The Legislative Assembly recognizes that over the years
the public has made frequent and uninterrupted use of lands abutting,

adjacent and contiguous to the public highways and state
recreation areas and recognizes, further, that where

#297

such use has been sufficient to create easements in the
public through dedication, prescription, grant or otherwise, that it is in the

public interest to protect and preserve such public
easements as a permanent part of Oregon’s recreational resources.

(3)Accordingly, the Legislative Assembly hereby declares
that all public rights and easements in those lands described in

subsection (2) of this section are confirmed and declared
vested exclusively in the State of Oregon and shall be held and administered

in the same manner as those lands described in ORS 390.720.

---

The state concedes that such legislation cannot divest a
person of his rights in land, Hughes v. Washington, 389 U.S. 290 (1967), and
that

the defendants’ record title, which includes the dry-sand
area, extends seaward to the ordinary or mean high-tide line. Borax
Consolidated Ltd. v.

Los Angeles, supra.

The landowners likewise concede that since 1899 the public’s
rights in the foreshore have been confirmed by law as well as by custom and

usage. Oregon Laws 1899, p. 3, provided:

That the shore of the Pacific ocean, between ordinary high
and extreme low tides, and from the Columbia river on the north to the

south boundary line of Clatsop county on the south, is
hereby declared a public highway, and shall forever remain open as such to the

public.

The disputed area is sui generis. While the foreshore is
“owned” by the state, and the upland is “owned” by the patentee or record-title

holder, neither can be said to “own” the full bundle of
rights normally connoted by the term “estate in fee simple.” 1 Powell, Real
Property § 163,

at 661 (1949).

In addition to the sui generis nature of the land itself, a
multitude of complex and sometimes overlapping precedents in the law confronted

the trial court. Several early Oregon decisions generally
support the trial court’s decision, i.e., that the public can acquire easements
in private

land by long-continued user that is inconsistent with the
owner’s exclusive possession and enjoyment of his land. A citation of the cases
could

end the discussion at this point. But because the early
cases do not agree on the legal theories by which the results are reached, and
because this

is an important case affecting valuable rights in land, it
is appropriate to review some of the law applicable to this case.

One group of precedents relied upon in part by the state and
by the trial court can be called the “implied-dedication” cases. The doctrine
of

implied dedication is well known to the law in this state
and elsewhere. See cases collected in Parks, The Law of Dedication in Oregon,
20 Or. L.

Rev. 1 1 1 (1941). Dedication, however, whether express or
implied, rests upon an intent to dedicate. In the case at bar, it is unlikely
that the

#298

landowners thought they had anything to dedicate, until
1967, when the notoriety of legislative debates about the public’s rights in
the dry-sand

area sent a number of ocean-front landowners to the offices
of their legal advisers.

A second group of cases relied upon by the state, but
rejected by the trial court, deals with the possibility of a landowner’s losing
the

exclusive possession and enjoyment of his land through the
development of prescriptive easements in the public.

In Oregon, as in most common-law jurisdictions, an easement
can be created in favor of one person in the land of another by uninterrupted

use and enjoyment of the land in a particular manner for the
statutory period, so long as the user is open, adverse, under claim of right,
but

without authority of law or consent of the owner. Feldman et
ux. v. Knapp et ux., 250 P.2d 92 (Or. 1952); Coventon v. Seufert, 32 P. 508
(Or.

1893). In Oregon, the prescriptive period is ten years. ORS
12.050. The public use of the disputed land in the case at bar is admitted to
be

continuous for more than sixty years. There is no suggestion
in the record that anyone’s permission was sought or given; rather, the public
used

the land under a claim of right. Therefore, if the public
can acquire an easement by prescription, the requirements for such an
acquisition have

been met in connection with the specific tract of land
involved in this case.

The owners argue, however, that the general public, not
being subject to actions in trespass and ejectment, cannot acquire rights by

prescription, because the statute of limitations is
irrelevant when an action does not lie.

While it may not be feasible for a landowner to sue the
general public, it is nonetheless possible by means of signs and fences to
prevent or

minimize public invasions of private land for recreational
purposes. In Oregon, moreover, the courts and the Legislative Assembly have
both

recognized that the public can acquire prescriptive
easements in private land, at least for roads and highways. See, e.g., Huggett
et ux. v. Moran

et ux., 266 P.2d 692 (Or. 1954), in which we observed that
counties could acquire public roads by prescription. And see ORS 368.405, which

provides for the manner in which counties may establish
roads. The statute enumerates the formal governmental actions that can be
employed,

and then concludes: “This section does not preclude
acquiring public ways by adverse user.”

Another statute codifies a policy favoring the acquisition
by prescription of public recreational easements in beach lands. See ORS
390.610.

While such a statute cannot create public rights at the
expense of a private landowner the statute can, and does, express legislative
approval of the

common-law doctrine of prescription where the facts justify
its application. Consequently, we conclude that the law in Oregon, regardless
of the

generalizations that may apply elsewhere, does not preclude
the creation of prescriptive easements in beach land for public recreational
use.

#299

Because many elements of prescription are present in this
case, the state has relied upon the doctrine in support of the decree below. We

believe, however, that there is a better legal basis for
affirming the decree. The most cogent basis for the decision in this case is
the English

doctrine of custom. Strictly construed, prescription applies
only to the specific tract of land before the court, and doubtful prescription
cases

could fill the courts for years with tract-by-tract
litigation. An established custom, on the other hand, can be proven with
reference to a larger

region. Ocean-front lands from the northern to the southern
border of the state ought to be treated uniformly.

The other reason which commends the doctrine of custom over
that of prescription as the principal basis for the decision in this case is
the

unique nature of the lands in question. This case deals
solely with the dry-sand area along the Pacific shore, and this land has been
used by the

public as public recreational land according to an unbroken
custom running back in time as long as the land has been inhabited.

A custom is defined in 1 Bouv. Law Dict., Rawle’s Third
Revision, p. 742 as “such a usage as by common consent and uniform practice has

become the law of the place, or of the subject matter to
which it relates.”

In 1 Blackstone, Commentaries *75–*78, Sir William
Blackstone set out the requisites of a particular custom.

Paraphrasing Blackstone, the first requirement of a custom,
to be recognized as law, is that it must be ancient. It must have been used so

long “that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary.”
Professor Cooley footnotes his edition of Blackstone with the comment that
“long

and general” usage is sufficient. In any event, the record
in the case at bar satisfies the requirement of antiquity. So long as there has
been an

institutionalized system of land tenure in Oregon, the
public has freely exercised the right to use the dry-sand area up and down the
Oregon coast

for the recreational purposes noted earlier in this opinion.

The second requirement is that the right be exercised
without interruption. A customary right need not be exercised continuously, but
it must

be exercised without an interruption caused by anyone
possessing a paramount right. In the case at bar, there was evidence that the
public’s use

and enjoyment of the dry-sand area had never been
interrupted by private landowners.

Blackstone’s third requirement, that the customary use be
peaceable and free from dispute, is satisfied by the evidence which related to
the

second requirement.

The fourth requirement, that of reasonableness, is satisfied
by the evidence that the public has always made use of the land in a manner

appropriate to the land and to the usages of the community.
There is evidence in the record that when inappropriate uses have been
detected,

municipal police officers have intervened to preserve order.

#300

The fifth requirement, certainty, is satisfied by the
visible boundaries of the dry-sand area and by the character of the land, which
limits the

use thereof to recreational uses connected with the
foreshore.

The sixth requirement is that a custom must be obligatory;
that is, in the case at bar, not left to the option of each landowner whether
or not

he will recognize the public’s right to go upon the dry-sand
area for recreational purposes. The record shows that the dry-sand area in
question

has been used, as of right, uniformly with similarly
situated lands elsewhere, and that the public’s use has never been questioned
by an upland

owner so long as the public remained on the dry sand and
refrained from trespassing upon the lands above the vegetation line.

Finally, a custom must not be repugnant, or inconsistent,
with other customs or with other law. The custom under consideration violates
no

law, and is not repugnant.

Two arguments have been arrayed against the doctrine of
custom as a basis for decision in Oregon. The first argument is that custom is

unprecedented in this state, and has only scant adherence
elsewhere in the United States. The second argument is that because of the
relative

brevity of our political history it is inappropriate to rely
upon an English doctrine that requires greater antiquity than a newly-settled
land can

muster. Neither of these arguments is persuasive.

The custom of the people of Oregon to use the dry-sand area
of the beaches for public recreational purposes meets every one of

Blackstone’s requisites. While it is not necessary to rely
upon precedent from other states, we are not the first state to recognize
custom as a

source of law. See Perley et ux’r v. Langley, 7 N.H. 233
(1834).

On the score of the brevity of our political history, it is
true that the Anglo-American legal system on this continent is relatively new.
Its

newness has made it possible for government to provide for
many of our institutions by written law rather than by customary law.^6 This
truism

does not, however, militate against the validity of a custom
when the custom does in fact exist. If antiquity were the sole test of validity
of a

custom, Oregonians could satisfy that requirement by
recalling that the European settlers were not the first people to use the
dry-sand area as

public land.

#301

Finally, in support of custom, the record shows that the
custom of the inhabitants of Oregon and of visitors in the state to use the dry
sand as

a public recreation area is so notorious that notice of the
custom on the part of persons buying land along the shore must be presumed. In
the case

at bar, the landowners conceded their actual knowledge of
the public’s long-standing use of the dry-sand area, and argued that the
elements of

consent present in the relationship between the landowners
and the public precluded the application of the law of prescription. As noted,
we are

not resting this decision on prescription, and we leave open
the effect upon prescription of the type of consent that may have been present
in this

case. Such elements of consent are, however, wholly
consistent with the recognition of public rights derived from custom.

Because so much of our law is the product of legislation, we
sometimes lose sight of the importance of custom as a source of law in our

society. It seems particularly appropriate in the case at
bar to look to an ancient and accepted custom in this state as the source of a
rule of law.

The rule in this case, based upon custom, is salutary in
confirming a public right, and at the same time it takes from no man anything
which he

has had a legitimate reason to regard as exclusively his.

For the foregoing reasons, the decree of the trial court is
affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The Oregon Supreme Court’s invocation of customary rights
to resolve the beach access controversy came as quite a surprise. The case had

been tried in the lower courts on a public easement theory,
not a theory of customary rights. There was no prior invocation of customary
rights in

Oregon case law, and no one urged the Oregon court to apply
the doctrine of customary rights. Note too that the 1967 amendment to the
Oregon Beach

Bill, quoted by the court, makes no mention of customary
rights (it affirms that “easements in the public” have been created “through
dedication,

prescription, grant or otherwise”). Is the question of
customary rights primarily one of fact? Should the court have remanded for a
new trial, rather than

deciding for itself that the record supported the conclusion
that a customary right had been established? In a later decision, _McDonald v.
Halvorson_ , 780

P. 2 d 714 (Or. 1989 ), the Oregon court held that customary
rights did not attach to a beach on an inland fresh water cove, because there
was no actual

proof of customary public use. Does _McDonald_ ’s
acknowledgment that the question is one of fact undercut _Thornton_ ’s
assertion that customary rights

exist along the ocean front all the way from the northern to
the southern border of the state?

2 .Ownership of land in Oregon, like that of most other
states west of the original thirteen, derives from patents or grants from the
federal

government. As the court notes in passing, the Supreme Court
held in 1935 that federal patents naming the Pacific Ocean as their boundary
should be

construed as extending to the mean high tide line—that is,
as including the dry sand area. Borax Consolidated, Ltd. v. Los Angeles, 296
U.S. 10 ( 1935 ).

Why weren’t property owners in Oregon whose land borders on

```

Ocean entitled to rely on this decision as an authoritative
expression of the extent of their property rights? Is it enough to say that the
decision “was

apparently little noticed by Oregonians” and “had no
discernible effect on the actual practices of Oregon beachgoers and upland
property owners?”

3 .The court makes much of the fact that most upland
property owners do not object when beachgoers use the dry sand area for picnics
or

supervising children at play. But why isn’t this just
neighborly behavior? Wouldn’t it be reasonable for an upland owner to tacitly
consent to such

innocuous use, while reserving the right to evict the
occasional raucous beer bash?

4 .Beaches are today without doubt the most contested ground
for claims that property is inherently public and cannot be subject to private

exclusion rights. The issue has been fought out state by
state, and sometimes beach by beach. A number of states have used the public
trust doctrine to

hold that all or part of the dry sand beach is inherently
public property. See, e.g., Glass v. Goeckel, 703 N.W. 2 d 58 , 62 (Mich. 2005
) (Michigan public

trust doctrine protects public right of access to beaches up
to the ordinary high water mark); Matthews v. Bay Head Improvement Ass’n, 471
A. 2 d 355 ,

363 (N.J. 1984 ) (New Jersey public trust doctrine protects
public access to dry sand areas of a beach controlled by a homeowners’
association). Florida,

Texas, and Hawaii have joined Oregon in dusting off versions
of the customary rights doctrine to declare public rights of access to dry sand
beaches.

Still others have rejected entreaties to declare beaches
public property on any theory. See, e.g., State ex rel. Haman v. Fox, 594 P. 2
d 1093 (Idaho 1979 ).

Given the plethora of theories and outcomes, it is difficult
to say with much confidence in many states exactly what rights the public has
to beaches. See,

e.g., Sean D. Hamill, No Line in the Sand on Beach Rights:
Confusion Reigns in State on Public Access to Shore, Chi. Trib., Aug. 9 , 2005
, Metro at 1

(surveying various experts and getting conflicting opinions
as to the extent of public access to beaches in Illinois).

5 .Notwithstanding the confusion, the overall trend seems to
be toward greater public rights or open access to beaches. How, if at all,
would

Demsetz explain the apparent evolution away from exclusion
rights and private property in beaches toward a regime that is more like an
open-access

commons?

6 .One difference between customary rights and other
theories for protecting public rights in beaches and other analogous resources
concerns the

ability of the legislature to revise the decision. The
public trust doctrine may or may not be subject to legislative revision. It
depends on how one

conceives of the legal source of the doctrine (federal
versus state law, constitutional law versus common law), and whether the
doctrine is viewed as a

rule of construction or a fixed qualification on title. In
some states, like Illinois, the public trust doctrine is viewed as a fixed
qualification on title and so

cannot be revised by the legislature. The doctrine of public
prescription probably is subject to legislative revision, although since
prescriptive easements

are property rights (see Chapter IX), the government might
have to condemn these rights and pay just compensation in order to eliminate
them. (If the

prescriptive easement belongs to the public, who

```



303



```

would receive the compensation?) The doctrine of customary
rights is clearly subject to legislative revision. Moreover, since it is
unclear that a

customary right is a property right, it is at least arguable
that the government would not have to pay just compensation to anyone in
abrogating

customary rights. Customary rights thus are the easiest for
the legislature to modify. Do you think this attribute of customary rights
provides an

additional reason to favor the approach of the Oregon
Supreme Court, or does it count against the court’s approach?

7 .Did the Oregon Supreme Court, by eliminating the right of
private property owners to exclude the public from the dry sand beach, commit a

“judicial taking”? In _Stevens v. City of Cannon Beach_ ,
854 P. 2 d 449 (Or. 1993 ), the Oregon court observed that there was no taking
in _Thornton_ because

property owners were on notice when they acquired their land
that the public routinely used the dry sand beach for recreational purposes.
The U.S.

Supreme Court recently rejected a similar claim in _Stop the
Beach Renourishment, Inc. v. Florida Department of Environmental Protection_ ,
560 U.S.

702 ( 2010 ) (excerpted in Chapter X, Part D). Two local
governments in Florida repaired a storm-damaged beach in such a way as to
insert a new public

beach between property line of upland owners and the water.
The owners claimed this had the effect of taking their right to future
accretions (see

Chapter II) and their right to have their property touch the
water. The Florida Supreme Court rejected the claim, concluding that these
rights did not exist

under Florida law. The owners then went to the U.S. Supreme
Court, arguing that the Florida court had committed a judicial taking. The
Court rejected

the claim, concluding that the Florida court was right in
finding that the claimed rights did not exist. But the Court split 4 – 4 on the
question whether

there is such a thing as a judicial taking (only eight
Justices participated in the decision). Justice Scalia, writing for four
Justices, said it makes no sense

to say that the judiciary can accomplish by revisions in
property law what would be a taking if attempted directly by the legislative or
executive

branches. Four other Justices said that the matter was
complex and raised a host of practical problems, making it premature to
pronounce on the issue.

[D]espite the power of the classical economic argument for
private property, a curious cross-current has continually washed through

American law. Our legal doctrine has strongly suggested that
some kinds of property should not be held exclusively in private hands, but
should

be open to the public or at least subject to what Roman law
called the “jus publicum”: the “public right.”

Moreover, this view is not merely a vestige of premodern
thought; there is currently an extensive academic and judicial discussion of
the

possibility that certain kinds of property ought to be
public. In recent years, the most striking version of this “inherent
publicness” argument

#304

has appeared in a series of cases expanding public access to
waterfront property. The land between the low and high tides has traditionally
been

considered “public property,” or at least subject to a
public easement for navigational and fishing purposes. But some modern courts
have

stretched this easement to include a new use—recreation—and
have expanded its area from the tidelands to the dry sand areas landward of the

high-tide mark.

These new cases extrapolate from older precedents in which
the public acquired—or allegedly reasserted—claims to certain types of

property, most notably roadways and lands under navigable
waters. Like the older precedents, the new beach cases usually employ one of
three

theoretical bases: (1) a “public trust” theory, to the
effect that the public has always rights of access to the property in question,
and that any

private rights are subordinate to the public’s “trust”
rights; (2) a prescriptive or dedicatory theory, by which a period of public
usage gives rise to

an implied grant or gift from private owners; and (3) a
theory of “custom,” where the public asserts ownership of property under some
claim so

ancient that it antedates any memory to the contrary.

These theories of increased public access to shores and
waterways have garnered a vocal but decidedly mixed reaction. In discussing
these

theories, some commentators applaud what they regard as a
proper recognition of public needs. The public trust idea in particular has
spawned an

enormous number of cases and articles, some urging extension
of a public trust to a much wider range of property where public access or
control

should be vindicated. But there have also been several very
sharp critiques of these cases and articles, and of the expansive doctrines of
public

control they propound. Some critics deny the underlying
public trust and dedicatory theories, and deplore what they see as an unjust
and

disruptive destruction of private property rights. They
argue that if the public wants or needs these waterfront lands so much, it
should have to

purchase them from the private owners. Moreover, they warn
of the consequences of these uncompensated and unpredictable transfers of

property rights: frustrated private owners may overreact in
trying to protect their property from any implication of “dedication” by
installing

guard dogs or blowing up access paths to the beach.

More generally, these critics reiterate the basic arguments
in favor of private ownership: uncertainty about property rights invites
conflicts

and squanders resources. The public access cases turn the
waterfront into a “commons,” where no one has any incentive to purchase the
property,

invest in it, or care for it, but only to consume as much as
possible—all of which leads to deterioration and waste. * * *

Perhaps these doctrines are indeed easily explicable through
classical economic thought, and can be subsumed under the well-recognized

exceptions to the general principle favoring private and
exclusive property rights: “plenteous” goods and “public goods.” The first

#305

class of exception concerns things that are either so
plentiful or so unbounded that it is not worth the effort to create a system of
resource

management for them, or—stated differently—things for which
the difficulty of privatization outweighs the gains in careful resource

management. Thus the oceans and air (it used to be said) are
at once so plentiful and so difficult to reduce to property that they are left
open to

the public at large.

The “plenitude” or “boundlessness” exceptions, however, fail
to explain the “publicness” of those properties that our traditional doctrines

most strongly deemed public property. Roadways, waterways,
and submerged lands—not to speak of open squares, which have also sometimes

been presumed public—are hardly so copious or so unbounded
that they are incapable of privatization. Riverbeds and shorelands can be
staked

out, roadways can be obstructed, waterways diverted, squares
plowed up; in short, they can easily be “reduced to possession” in the classic

common law manner of creating proprietary rights out of a
“commons.” Thus the “public” character of such lands, or even a public easement

over them, must have some basis other than our incapacity to
reduce them to private possession.

The second exception to the general rule favoring private
property may be of more assistance. Since the mid-nineteenth century,
economists

have told us that there exist predictable instances of
“market failure,” where Adam Smith’s invisible hand fails to guide privately
owned

resources to their socially optimal uses. These involve
“public goods,” “natural monopolies,” “externalities,” and the like. While some
of these

problems may be solved by collective agreements among the
owners of the resources, such agreements are costly and, particularly where a
large

number of parties must be involved, private collective
action is not always possible. Inefficiencies will remain.

Thus a governmental body might be the most useful manager
where many persons desire access to or control over a given property, but they

are too numerous and their individual stakes too small to
express their preferences in market transactions; governmental ownership could
broker

those preferences. Similarly, a government might be a
superior manager (or regulator) of a property whose use involves economies of
scale—the

railways, bridges, or grain elevators whose monopoly
position classically justified governmental ownership or control. Or a
government might be

a superior manager of those “collective goods” like the
broadcast spectrum, wherein some management structure is required to make
individual

users take account of other users’ interests. In a sense, we
rely on governmental management of our preeminent system of resource management

—private property—and we might view the entire private
property regime as a “public property” owned and managed by governmental
bodies.

Conventional wisdom instructs that in such cases, the most
productive solution would be for government to assume some or all of the

#306

rights of ownership and control over the property, and to
use its powers to correct the market’s misallocation. This conventional
conclusion is

subject to four conventional caveats: the state must be able
correctly to identify instances of market failure; it must be clever enough to
exercise

its powers so as to reduce the inefficiency; it must avoid
errors or political temptations to exercise its powers in ways that create new

inefficiencies; and the costs of effective state
intervention must not exceed the increase in production it brings about.

This standard paradigm of neoclassical economics and modern
microeconomic theory recognizes only two property regimes: either

ownership is vested in private parties or it resides with an
organized state. The usual economic approach to property law suggests that
productive

efficiency will be enhanced when private property is the
norm, but government intervenes in recognized instances of market failure.

Thus in the conventional lore, markets are based on private
rights or, when markets fail, property may be governmentally managed in the

interests of aggregate efficiency. Yet these two options do
not logically exhaust all the possible solutions. Neither can they adequately
describe all

that one finds in the recorded history of property in the
Anglo-American universe. In particular, there lies outside purely private
property and

government-controlled “public property” a distinct class of
“inherently public property” which is fully controlled by neither government
nor

private agents. Since the Middle Ages this category of
“inherently public property” has provided each member of some “public” with a
bundle of

rights, neither entirely alienable by state or other
collective action, nor necessarily “managed” in any explicitly organized
manner. Aside from

individual private property, the nineteenth-century common
law of property in both Britain and America, with surprising consistency,
recognized

two distinguishable types of public property. One of these
was property “owned” and actively managed by a governmental body. The other,

however, was property collectively “owned” and “managed” by
society at large, with claims independent of and indeed superior to the claims
of

any purported governmental manager. It is this latter type
that I call “inherently public property.”

Implicit in these older doctrines is the notion that, even
if a property should be open to the public, it does not follow that public
rights

should necessarily vest in an active governmental manager.
Despite the well-known problems of unorganized collective access to a
resource—the

“tragedy of the commons”—equally difficult problems are
posed by governmental management: the cost of instituting that management and,

perhaps, the temptations of politically motivated
redistribution. In some circumstances, then, nineteenth-century common law
recognized

collective public rights as the optimal alternative whether
or not those rights were managed governmentally. * * *

What was so bad about private ownership of “inherently
public properties”? * * *

#307

One controversy of particular importance for
nineteenth-century roadway prescription concerned the location of purported
roads. * * *

As a general rule * * * the exception for roadways applied
only to specific passageways, not to open spaces. This exception prevented

private holdout against public passage; but it only came
into play upon a genuine threat of such behavior. Public meanderings anywhere
across

an open field suggested that the public had no focused need
for a particular path and private owners felt no pronounced temptation for

exploitation; therefore such meanderings would not raise a
presumption of “dedication.”

This anti-holdout rationale is strengthened by its
similarity to other nineteenth-century American roadway doctrines. Roadways
were the

classic subject of eminent domain by the “organized” public.
Prescriptive doctrines, by analogy to private law doctrines, assured that the

“unorganized” public—which could not exercise eminent
domain—was also protected from private holdout. A private party could sometimes

own a toll road, but his potential power to capture all
“rents” of travel was tempered by treatment as a public utility: the road was
open to all

members of the public, and the owner could charge tolls
reflecting not what the market would bear, but only what would suffice to
reimburse his

expenses. * * *

Like roadway doctrine, waterway doctrine also reflected an
antipathy to the possibility of private monopolization of public passage. This

was hardly surprising; it was a commonplace of
nineteenth-century jurisprudence that waterways were a “highway” for travel and
commerce.

Moreover, their location was largely fixed by nature, so
that their use was even more subject to holdout than roadways, which are
movable. Thus

holdout potential explains several cases elevating the
public right of water passage above all other uses, even bridges for land roads
unless

specifically authorized by legislatures. Land traffic might
find some other route, whereas ships had no alternative and were especially
susceptible

to exploitation. * * *

Th[e] rejection of recreation as a public trust purpose,
taken together with strong protection of commercial travel on waterways,
suggests

that the fear of private holdout was central to early
nineteenth-century thinking about public access to waterways. * * * The uses of
waterways

most subject to monopolization or holdout were
transportation and commerce, which involved movement from place to place over a
relatively

narrow “path.” As one British court stated, the beach is
“not to be regarded as in the full sense of the word a highway,” open to
recreational uses:

no matter how ungenerous the act, beach owners were entitled
to treat as trespassers “every bather, every nursemaid with a

#308

perambulator, every boy riding a donkey, and every preacher
on the shore.”^229

Thus, it is difficult to fit into a “holdout” rationale such
public trust uses as swimming, fishing, and hunting. Recreational uses might
occur

in numerous places, without requiring any great stretch of
waterway; moreover, in any normal market, a variety of riparian owners might

compete to provide swimming or other recreational
facilities. This presents [a] problem * * *: why should we guarantee public
access for

recreational purposes when there seems to be no threat of
private holdout?

[Professor Rose then argues that in addition to holdout
prevention, a second rationale supports the publicness of certain spaces,
namely

increasing returns to scale of the activities practiced
there. She notes that the traditional public trust doctrines for roads and
waterways

overwhelmingly focused on encouraging commerce, and that
commerce itself has increasing returns as markets expand; those reasons would

support doctrines of open lanes to encourage ever more
members of the public to participate. She then returns to the subject of
recreation.] * * *

Certainly the role of recreation is a striking example of
historic change in public property doctrine. If recreation now seems to support
the

“publicness” of some property, this undoubtedly reflects a
change in our attitudes toward recreation. We might suspect that this changed
attitude

relates to an increasing perception of recreation as having
something analogous to scale returns, and as a socializing institution.

Recreation is often carried on in a social setting, and
therefore it clearly improves with scale to some degree: one must have a
partner for

chess, two teams for baseball, etc. But in the
mid-nineteenth century, Frederick Law Olmsted argued that recreation had scale
returns in a much

more expansive sense: recreation can be a socializing and
educative influence, particularly helpful for democratic values.^320 Thus rich
and poor

would mingle in parks, and learn to treat each other as
neighbors. Parks would enhance public mental health, with ultimate benefits to
sociability;

all could revive from the antisocial characteristics of
urban life under the refining influence of the park’s soothing landscape. Later
recreation and

park advocates, though moving away from Olmsted’s more
contemplative ethic, also stressed the democratic education that comes with
sports

and team play.

Insofar as recreation educates and socializes us, it acts as
a “social glue” for everyone, not just those immediately engaged; and of
course,

the more people involved in any socializing activity, the
better. Like commerce, then, recreation has social and political overtones. The

contemplation of nature elevates our minds above the
workaday world,

#309

and thus helps us to cope with that very world; recreational
play trains us in the democratic give-and-take that makes our regime function.
If

these arguments are true, we should not worry that people
engage in too much recreation, but too little. This again argues that
recreation should

be open to all at minimal costs, or at costs to be borne by
the general public, since all of us benefit from the greater sociability of our
fellow

citizens. If we accept these arguments, we might believe
that unique recreational sites ought not be private property; their greatest
value lies in

civilizing and socializing all members of the public, and
this value should not be “held up” by private owners.

These arguments support the recent decisions defending
public access to the beach. The public’s recreational use arguably is the most

valuable use of this property and requires an entire expanse
of beach (for unobstructed walking, viewing, contemplation) which could
otherwise

be blocked and “held up” by private owners. But * * * [d]o
people using the beach really become more civil, or acquire the mental habits
of

democracy? And even if they do, is there really a danger of
holdout that necessitates inalienable public access?

Attractive as this Olmstedian view may seem, these are not
always easy arguments to support, and are extraordinarily difficult to prove.
The

argument that recreation or the contemplation of nature
makes us more civilized and sociable has a very long pedigree in Western
thought.

Moreover, it may seem particularly attractive as our
confidence has waned (perhaps somewhat unjustifiably) in the socializing
qualities of

commerce. With respect to the holdout problem, one might be
skeptical and think that where waterfront owners are numerous, they cannot
really

siphon off the value of expansive public uses. But whether
or not one accepts these arguments in the modern beach debate, older doctrine

suggests that the “scale returns” of socialization, taken
together with the possibility of private holdout, will underlie any arguments
for the

inherent publicness of property.

Perhaps the chief lesson from the nineteenth-century
doctrines of “inherently public property,” then, is that while we may change
our minds

about which activities are socializing, we always accept
that the public requires access to some physical locations for some of these
activities.

Our law consistently allocates that access to the public,
because public access to those locations is as important as the general
privatization of

property in other spheres of our law. In the absence of the
socializing activities that take place on “inherently public property,” the
public is a

shapeless mob, whose members neither trade nor converse nor
play, but only fight, in a setting where life is, in Hobbes’ all too famous
phrase,

solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Do you agree with Rose that the movement toward making
beaches an open access resource can be explained (or at least justified) on the

ground

```



310



```

that this promotes social contact among a large number of
persons of mixed backgrounds? What about persons who simply want to take
solitary walks

on the beach, or quietly contemplate a sunset? If
socialization is the objective, wouldn’t small crowded beaches be better than
long, unobstructed

beaches?

2 .Considering the material covered in this
section—including that on navigable waters, navigable airspace, the public
trust doctrine, customary

rights, and the doctrine of public prescriptive rights
mentioned in _Thornton_ and in the Rose excerpt—do you agree with Rose that
there are three

categories of property—private, governmental, and inherently
public—or just two categories—private and governmental?

3 .One operational distinction between governmental property
and inherently public property might be based on who has standing to enforce
the

property right. Governmental property would be property that
can be enforced only by duly appointed officers of the state—such as the state
Attorney

General’s office or the U.S. Department of Justice.
Inherently public property would be property that any member of the public can
seek to enforce. In

this regard, it is interesting to note that many states,
including Illinois, have moved toward recognizing very broad “citizen standing”
to enforce the

public trust doctrine. Illinois traditionally followed the
rule that only officers of the state could enforce the trust. See, e.g., People
ex rel. Attorney

General v. Kirk, 45 N.E. 830 (Ill. 1896 ). More recently, it
overruled this understanding and held that any taxpayer can sue to enforce the
trust. See

Paepcke v. Public Building Commission of Chicago, 263 N.E. 2
d 11 (Ill. 1970 ); see also Friends of the Parks v. Chicago Park District, 786
N.E. 2 d 161 ,

169 – 70 (Ill. 2003 ) (not questioning private parties’
right to enforce the trust).

4 .Another possible category is what has been called
“antiproperty,” which is in effect a private right to veto nonpublic uses of
public property. The

public dedication doctrine, mentioned by Rose, is
effectively a form of antiproperty, because it allows private property owners
who are uniquely affected

by a dedication of public property—such as those who own
property abutting a street or a park—to sue in equity to enforce the public
dedication. Such

antiproperty rights can be quite powerful in preserving
public spaces, since in effect the government must obtain unanimous consent
from abutting

owners to eliminate a public use. See Joseph D. Kearney
& Thomas W. Merrill, Private Rights in Public Lands: The Chicago Lakefront,
Montgomery

Ward, and the Public Dedication Doctrine, 105 Nw. U. L. Rev.
1417 ( 2011 ); Abraham Bell & Gideon Parchomovsky, Of Property and
Antiproperty, 102

Mich. L. Rev. 1 ( 2003 ).

5 .If we decide that certain types of resources, like
beaches, are “inherently public,” and if we confer standing on any member of
the public to

block privatization or perhaps even development of these
resources, does this create a danger of a regulatory “anticommons”? See Chapter
II. In other

words, do we create too much exclusion? Does “antiproperty,”
such as the veto rights in abutting private owners recognized by the public
dedication

doctrine, succumb to the same problem, or does the limited
number of private enforcers mitigate this concern, at least to a degree?

### E. WATER

Water is a particularly important resource with a wide
variety of uses, including drinking and household consumption, farming, raising

livestock, irrigation, mining, power, manufacturing, sewage,
navigation, wildlife, and recreation. Water can also serve aesthetic and

environmental values. These last include what are sometimes
called “ecosystem services.” Given a growing population with rising demand for

water consumption, and the simultaneous rise in demand for
the preservation of lakes and streams for recreational and ecological purposes,

clashes over water rights will likely intensify in the
coming years.

Water is a unique resource different in many respects from
land and the typical objects of personal property rights. Water is a fugitive

resource with a flow that is only partly predictable. It is
also a renewable resource, as a result of the hydrologic cycle. Given its
peculiar

characteristics, water has always been treated differently
from other kinds of resources. Water rights have aspects of both private rights
and

public rights; they are at once open to individual
appropriation and subject to correlative duties to other users. Given the
uniqueness of water

rights, arguments for greater privatization of water—such as
by making water rights freely transferable like other commodities—have long
been,

and continue to be, controversial.

In the United States, water law consists of a common-law
base with statutory and regulatory overlays, at the state and federal levels.
In

these materials we will concentrate on the common law of
water and how it relates to property law’s treatment of other resources.

First, some terminology. The law distinguishes water along
two axes: surface versus underground , and diffuse versus in a defined channel

(or body). We turn first to water in a surface stream, with
a look at two different systems, riparian rights and prior appropriation.
Diffuse surface

water is very different—it is considered undesirable and
something to be warded off rather than “used.” Next we take a look at
groundwater, for

which the distinction between diffuse and running in a
defined channel has often been important, but also criticized.

### 1 .WATERCOURSES

A riparian owner is one whose land abuts the watercourse,
and riparian water rights are appurtenant to the land—the rights to the land
and

the right to use the water from the surface stream form a
package that cannot be split up. (The “littoral” rights of owners whose land
abuts a lake,

sea, or ocean are similar to riparian rights.) English law
developed a conception of riparian rights known as the natural flow theory,
whereby each

riparian owner could prevent any diversion of the natural
flow of a river or stream by an upstream riparian owner. In effect, any
disturbance of

the natural flow required the consent of each downstream
owner. This

#312

conception of riparian rights found little favor in the
United States, on the grounds that it imposed too great a barrier to the use of
water for

economic development, such as diverting streams to power
water mills. Early on, American courts began to reject the natural flow theory
in

favor of a more flexible conception of riparian rights that
came to be known as the reasonable use theory. The next case is illustrative of
the

circumstances that gave rise to this American version of
riparian rights doctrine.

■
LOCKWOOD, JUSTICE, delivered the opinion of the court: This was an action on
the case , brought in the Greene Circuit Court, by Merriweather

against Evans, for obstructing and diverting a water course.
The plaintiff obtained a verdict, and judgment was rendered thereon. On the
trial the

defendant excepted to the instructions asked for and given,
at the instance of the plaintiff. The defendant also excepted, because
instructions that

were asked by him, were refused. After the cause was brought
into this court, the parties agreed upon the following statement of facts, as
having

been proved on the trial, to wit:

* * * Smith and Baker, in 1834, bought of T. Carlin six
      acres of land, through which a branch ran, and erected a steam mill

thereon. They depended upon a well and the branch for water
in running their engine. About one or two years afterwards, John Evans

bought of T. Carlin six acres of land, on the same branch,
above and immediately adjoining the lot owned by Smith & Baker, and

erected theron a steam mill, depending upon a well and the
branch for water in running his engine.

Smith & Baker, after the erection of Evans’ mill, in
1836 or 1837, sold the mill and appurtenances to Merriweather, for about

$8,000. Evans’ mill was supposed to be worth $12,000.
Ordinarily there was an abundance of water for both mills; but in the fall of

1837, there being a drought, the branch failed, so far that
it did not afford water sufficient to run the upper mill continually. Evans

directed his hands not to stop, or divert the water, in the
branch; but one of them employed about the mill did make a dam across the

branch, just below Evans’ mill, and thereby diverted all the
water in the branch into Evans’ well. Evans was at home, half a mile from

the mill, and was frequently about his mill, and evidence
was introduced conducing to prove that he might have known that the water

of the branch was diverted into his well. After the
diversion of the water into Evans’ well, as aforesaid, the branch went dry
below, and

Merriweather’s mill could not and did not run, in
consequence of it, more than one day in a week, and was then

#313

supplied with water from his well. Merriweather then brought
this suit, in three or four weeks after the putting of the dam across the

branch for the diversion of the water, and obtained a
verdict for $150. This suit, it is admitted, is the first between the parties
litigating

the right as to the use of the water. It is further agreed,
that the branch afforded usually sufficient water for the supply of both mills,

without materially affecting the size of the current, though
the branch was not depended upon exclusively for that purpose.

Furthermore, that at the time of the grievances complained
of by the plaintiff below, the defendant had water hauled in part for the

supply of his boilers. That the dam was made below the
defendant’s well, across the branch, which diverted as well the water hauled

and poured out into the branch above the well, as the water
of the branch, into the defendant’s well....

Upon this state of facts, the question is presented, as to
what extent riparian proprietors, upon a stream not navigable, can use the
water of

such stream? The branch mentioned in the agreed statement of
facts, is a small natural stream of water, not furnishing, at all seasons of
the year, a

supply of water sufficient for both mills. There are no
facts in the case showing that the water is wanted for any other than milling
purposes, and

for those purposes to be converted into steam, and thus
entirely consumed. In an early case decided in England,^1 it is laid down that
“A water

course begins ‘ ex jure naturae ,’ and having taken a
certain course naturally, can not be diverted.” The language of all the
authorities is, that water

flows in its natural course, and should be permitted thus to
flow, so that all through whose land it naturally flows, may enjoy the
privilege of

using it. The property in the water, therefore, by virtue of
the riparian ownership, is in its nature usufructuary, and consists, in
general, not so

much of the fluid itself, as of the advantage of its
impetus.^2 A riparian proprietor, therefore, though he has an undoubted right
to use the water for

hydraulic or manufacturing purposes, must so use it as to do
no injury to any other riparian proprietor. Some decisions, in laying down the
rights

of riparian proprietors of water courses, have gone so far
as to restrict their right in the use of water flowing over their land, so that
there shall be

no diminution in the quantity of the water, and no
obstruction to its course. The decisions last referred to cannot, however, be
considered as

furnishing the true doctrine on this subject. Mr. Justice
Storey, in delivering the opinion of the court, in the case of Tyler v.
Wilkinson,^3 says,

I do not mean to be understood as holding the doctrine that
there can be no diminution whatever, and no obstruction or

#314

impediment whatever, by a riparian proprietor in the use of
water as it flows; for that would be to deny any valuable use of it. There

may be, and there must be, of that which is common to all, a
reasonable use. The true test of the principle and extent of the use is,

whether it is to the injury of the other proprietors or not.
There may be diminution in quantity, or a retardation or acceleration of the

natural current, indispensable for the general and valuable
use of the water, perfectly consistent with the use of the common right. The

diminution, retardation, or acceleration, not positively and
sensibly injurious, by diminishing the value of the common right, is an

implied element in the right of using the stream at all. The
law here, as in many other cases, acts with a reasonable reference to public

convenience and general good, and is not betrayed into a
narrow strictness, subversive of common use, nor into an extravagant

looseness, which would destroy private rights.

The same learned judge further says, “That of a thing common
by nature, there may be an appropriation by general consent or grant. Mere

priority of appropriation of running water, without such
consent or grant, confers no exclusive right.” * * *

Each riparian proprietor is bound to make such a use of
running water as to do as little injury to those below him as is consistent
with a

valuable benefit to himself. The use must be a reasonable
one. Now the question fairly arises, is that a reasonable use of running water
by the

upper proprietor, by which the fluid itself is entirely
consumed? To answer this question satisfactorily, it is proper to consider the
wants of man in

regard to the element of water. These wants are either
natural or artificial. Natural are such as are absolutely necessary * * * to
his existence.

Artificial, such only as, by supplying them, his comfort and
prosperity are increased. To quench thirst, and for household purposes, water
is

absolutely indispensable. In civilized life, water for
cattle is also necessary. These wants must be supplied, or both man and beast
will perish.

The supply of man’s artificial wants is not essential to his
existence; it is not indispensable; he could live if water was not employed in

irrigating lands, or in propelling his machinery. In
countries differently situated from ours, with a hot and arid climate, water
doubtless is

absolutely indispensable to the cultivation of the soil, and
in them, water for irrigation would be a natural want. Here it might increase
the

products of the soil, but it is by no means essential, and
cannot, therefore, be considered a natural want of man. So of manufactures,
they promote

the prosperity and comfort of mankind, but cannot be
considered absolutely necessary to his existence; nor need the machinery which
he

employs be set in motion by steam.

From these premises would result this conclusion: that an
individual owning a spring on his land, from which water flows in a current

through

#315

his neighbor’s land, would have the right to use the whole
of it, if necessary to satisfy his natural wants. He may consume all the water
for his

domestic purposes, including water for his stock. If he
desires to use it for irrigation or manufactures, and there be a lower
proprietor to whom its

use is essential to supply his natural wants, or for his
stock, he must use the water so as to leave enough for such lower proprietor.
Where the

stream is small, and does not supply water more than
sufficient to answer the natural wants of the different proprietors living on
it, none of the

proprietors can use the water for either irrigation or
manufactures. So far, then, as natural wants are concerned, there is no
difficulty in furnishing

a rule by which riparian proprietors may use flowing water
to supply such natural wants. Each proprietor in his turn may, if necessary,
consume

all the water for these purposes. But where the water is not
wanted to supply natural wants and there is not sufficient for each proprietor
living on

the stream, to carry on his manufacturing purposes, how
shall the water be divided? We have seen that, without a contract or grant,
neither has a

right to use all the water; all have a right to participate
in its benefits. Where all have a right to participate in a common benefit, and
none can

have an exclusive enjoyment, no rule, from the very nature
of the case, can be laid down, as to how much each may use without infringing
upon

the rights of others. In such cases, the question must be
left to the judgment of the jury, whether the party complained of has used,
under all the

circumstances, more than his just proportion.

It appears, from the facts agreed on, that Evans obstructed
the water by a dam, and diverted the whole into his well. This diversion,

according to all the cases, both English and American, was
clearly illegal. For this diversion, an action will lie. * * * Having availed
himself of

the illegal act of his servant, the law presumes he
authorized it. Having arrived at the conclusion that an action will lie in
behalf of Merriweather

against Evans, for obstructing and diverting the water
course mentioned in the plaintiff’s declaration, I have not deemed it necessary
to examine

the instructions given by the court, to see if they accord
with the principles above laid down. Having decided that the plaintiff below
has a right

to recover on the facts, whether the instructions were right
or wrong would not vary that result. It is possible that if the true principles
which

govern this action had been correctly given to the jury, the
damages might have been either less or more than the jury have given; but in
this case,

as the damages are small, the court ought not, where justice
has upon the whole been done, to send the case back, to see if a jury, upon
another

trial, would not give less.

For these reasons I am of opinion that the judgment ought to
be affirmed, with costs.

#316

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The English natural flow theory bears a resemblance to
the law of trespass, in the sense that any material interference with
downstream riparian

rights is forbidden unless the downstream owner consents.
The American reasonable use doctrine is more like the law of nuisance, in the
sense that a

wide variety of contextual factors are relevant in
determining whether a diversion is actionable. According to the _Restatement
(Second) of Torts_

§ 850 (A) (Am. L. Inst. 1970 ), a court determining whether
a use is reasonable should consider the purpose of the use, its suitability to
the water course,

the economic and social values at stake, the harm caused,
possible accommodation techniques, the protection of existing investments, the
ability of

adversely affected riparians to bear the loss, and
“justice.” That would seem to cover just about everything. What accounts for
the shift from a strict and

predictable doctrine that emphasizes bargaining and consent
to one that allows courts to arbitrate disputes among competing riparian
claimants? Are the

factors that explain the shift similar to the ones that
might explain the shift from trespass to nuisance when we move from large
invasions of land to

small invasions or other interferences with use and
enjoyment of land? The emergence of new technologies like water mills is
clearly part of the

explanation. See Morton J. Horwitz, The Transformation of
American Law, 1780 – 1860 , at 34 – 47 ( 1977 ); Carol Rose, Energy and
Efficiency in the

Realignment of Common-Law Water Rights, 19 J. Legal Stud.
261 , 264 – 96 ( 1990 ). Does this suggest that the shift to reasonable use has
a broadly

Demsetzian explanation? For an argument that water law
developed in part according to the internal unfolding of the common law and its
own culture,

including a reinvigoration of natural-rights-based
riparianism in nineteenth-century England, see Joshua Getzler, A History of
Water Rights at Common

Law ( 2004 ).

2 .In at least one critical respect the analogy between the
riparian doctrine of reasonable use and the law of nuisance is incomplete. As
mentioned

earlier, riparian rights run with the land and cannot be
severed. Thus, riparian owner A could not sell his rights to nonriparian owner
B. Courts have

tended to enforce this rule quite strictly. What accounts
for this refusal to treat water as a pure commodity that can be severed from
use with respect to

particular parcels of riparian land? Of course, people
inevitably found room to maneuver around the rule against severance. What
happens if A

subdivides his parcel into two parcels, each with one half
of the frontage on the water course? Why stop at two parcels? This is the
so-called “bowling

alley parcel” problem, in which a riparian landowner sells
narrow strips of land to nonriparians, who would then claim rights of
reasonable use. Riparian

law accordingly developed detailed doctrines to deal with
subdivisions of the riparian parcels that threatened to impose too great a
burden on other

riparian owners.

3. _Evans v. Merriweather_ also draws a sharp distinction
   between “natural” wants and “artificial” wants. A more common way of drawing
   the same

distinction today is to distinguish between “domestic” and
“other” (i.e., nondomestic) uses. The granting of an absolute priority for
“natural” or

“domestic” uses over “artificial” or “other” uses is also
characteristic of

```



317



```

reasonable use doctrine. Domestic uses include household
uses (for cleaning and cooking) and small-scale livestock watering—the small
farm or

homestead is the model for “natural” or “domestic” needs. As
employed by the _Evans_ court, this distinction comes into play only during
periods of

drought, when there is too little water to satisfy the
natural wants of all riparians. _Evans_ seems to suggest that when drought
strikes, the upstream

riparian can fulfill all his domestic needs, even if this
means downstream riparians get little or no water at all. Why privilege the
upstream riparian in

this fashion? Why not award the water to the first of the
competing riparians to have appropriated water for domestic uses? Why not
apportion the water

among the competing riparians—equally, according to
frontage, or on some other basis?

4 .Do principles of adverse possession, considered in
Chapter II, apply to riparian water rights? If so, how should adverse use be
defined in this

context? Is prior appropriation of water enough to establish
adversity as against other riparians who seek to appropriate water at a later
time? Or must

the appropriation be sufficiently great to interfere with
what would be classified as “natural” or “domestic” uses by other riparians?

5. _Evans_ suggests that periods of drought will be
   relatively rare in a state like Illinois, which usually has adequate rainfall
   to replenish flowing

streams. But what happens in a relatively more arid state
where drought is more or less the perpetual state of affairs? Consider the
following case.

#### Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Company

```



Supreme Court of Colorado, 1882.



6 Colo. 443.



```

■ HELM,
J. Appellee, who was plaintiff below, claimed to be the owner of certain water
by virtue of an appropriation thereof from the south fork

of the St. Vrain creek. It appears that such water, after
its diversion, is carried by means of a ditch to the James creek, and thence
along the bed of

the same to Left Hand creek, where it is again diverted by
lateral ditches and used to irrigate lands adjacent to the last named stream.
Appellants

are the owners of lands lying on the margin and in the
neighborhood of the St. Vrain below the mouth of said south fork thereof, and
naturally

irrigated therefrom.

In 1879 there was not a sufficient quantity of water in the
St. Vrain to supply the ditch of appellee and also irrigate the said lands of

appellant. A portion of appellee’s dam was torn out, and its
diversion of water thereby seriously interfered with by appellants. The action
is

brought for damages arising from the trespass, and for
injunctive relief to prevent repetitions thereof in the future. * * *

It is contended by counsel for appellants that the common
law principles of riparian proprietorship prevailed in Colorado until 1876, and

that the doctrine of priority of right to water by priority
of appropriation thereof was first recognized and adopted in the constitution.
But we

think the latter doctrine has existed from the date

#318

of the earliest appropriations of water within the
boundaries of the state. The climate is dry, and the soil, when moistened only
by the usual

rainfall, is arid and unproductive; except in a few favored
sections, artificial irrigation for agriculture is an absolute necessity. Water
in the

various streams thus acquires a value unknown in moister
climates. Instead of being a mere incident to the soil, it rises, when
appropriated, to the

dignity of a distinct usufructuary estate, or right of
property. It has always been the policy of the national, as well as the
territorial and state

governments, to encourage the diversion and use of water in
this country for agriculture; and vast expenditures of time and money have been

made in reclaiming and fertilizing by irrigation portions of
our unproductive territory. Houses have been built, and permanent improvements

made; the soil has been cultivated, and thousands of acres
have been rendered immensely valuable, with the understanding that
appropriations of

water would be protected. Deny the doctrine of priority or
superiority of right by priority of appropriation, and a great part of the
value of all this

property is at once destroyed. * * *

We conclude, then, that the common law doctrine giving the
riparian owner a right to the flow of water in its natural channel upon and
over

his lands, even though he makes no beneficial use thereof,
is inapplicable to Colorado. Imperative necessity, unknown to the countries
which

gave it birth, compels the recognition of another doctrine
in conflict therewith. And we hold that, in the absence of express statutes to
the

contrary, the first appropriator of water from a natural
stream for a beneficial purpose has, with the qualifications contained in the
constitution, a

prior right thereto, to the extent of such appropriation.
See Schilling v. Rominger, 4 Colo. 100, 103 (1878).

The territorial legislature in 1864 expressly recognizes the
doctrine. It says: “Nor shall the water of any stream be diverted from its
original

channel to the detriment of any miner, millmen or others
along the line of said stream, who may have a priority of right , and there
shall be at all

times left sufficient water in said stream for the use of
miners and agriculturists along said stream.” Session Laws of 1864, p. 68, §
32.

The priority of right mentioned in this section is acquired
by priority of appropriation, and the provision declares that appropriations of

water shall be subordinate to the use thereof by prior
appropriators. This provision remained in force until the adoption of the
constitution; it was

repealed in 1868, but the repealing act re-enacted it
verbatim.

But the rights of appellee were acquired, in the first
instance, under the acts of 1861 and 186 2, and counsel for appellants urge,
with no little

skill and plausibility, that these statutes are in conflict
with our conclusion that priority of right is acquired by priority of
appropriation. The only

provision, however, which can be construed as referring to
this subject is § 4 on page 68, Session Laws of 1861. This section provides for
the

appointment of commissioners, in times of scarcity, to
apportion the stream “in a just and equitable proportion,” to the best
interests of all

#319

parties, “with a due regard to the legal rights of all.”
What is meant by the concluding phrases of the foregoing statute? What are the
legal rights

for which the commissioners are enjoined to have a “due
regard?” Why this additional limitation upon the powers of such commissioners?

It seems to us a reasonable inference that these phrases had
reference to the rights acquired by priority of appropriation. This view is

sustained by the universal respect shown at the time said
statute was adopted, and subsequently by each person, for the prior
appropriations of

others, and the corresponding customs existing among
settlers with reference thereto. This construction does not, in our judgment,
detract from

the force or effect of the statute. It was the duty of the
commissioners under it to guard against extravagance and waste, and to so
divide and

distribute the water as most economically to supply all of
the earlier appropriators thereof according to their respective appropriations
and

necessities, to the extent of the amount remaining in the
stream.

It appears from the record that the patent under which
appellant George W. Coffin holds title was issued prior to the act of congress
of 1866,

hereinbefore mentioned. That it contained no reservation or
exception of vested water rights, and conveyed to Coffin through his grantor
the

absolute title in fee simple to his land, together with all
incidents and appurtenances thereunto belonging; and it is claimed that
therefore the

doctrine of priority of right by appropriation cannot, at
least, apply to him. We have already declared that water appropriated and
diverted for a

beneficial purpose is, in this country, not necessarily an
appurtenance to the soil through which the stream supplying the same naturally
flows. If

appropriated by one prior to the patenting of such soil by
another, it is a vested right entitled to protection, though not mentioned in
the patent.

But we are relieved from any extended consideration of this
subject by the decision in Broder v. Natoma W. & M. Co., 101 U.S. (1 1
Otto) 274

(1879).

It is urged, however, that even if the doctrine of priority
or superiority of right by priority of appropriation be conceded, appellee in
this case

is not benefited thereby. Appellants claim that they have a
better right to the water because their lands lie along the margin and in the

neighborhood of the St. Vrain. They assert that, as against
them, appellee’s diversion of said water to irrigate lands adjacent to Left
Hand creek,

though prior in time, is unlawful. In the absence of
legislation to the contrary, we think that the right to water acquired by
priority of

appropriation thereof is not in any way dependent upon the
locus of its application to the beneficial use designed. And the disastrous

consequences of our adoption of the rule contended for,
forbid our giving such a construction to the statutes as will concede the same,
if they will

properly bear a more reasonable and equitable one.

The doctrine of priority of right by priority of
appropriation for agriculture is evoked, as we have seen, by the imperative
necessity for

#320

artificial irrigation of the soil. And it would be an
ungenerous and inequitable rule that would deprive one of its benefit simply
because he has, by

large expenditure of time and money, carried the water from
one stream over an intervening watershed and cultivated land in the valley of

another. It might be utterly impossible, owing to the
topography of the country, to get water upon his farm from the adjacent stream;
or if

possible, it might be impracticable on account of the
distance from the point where the diversion must take place and the attendant
expense; or

the quantity of water in such stream might be entirely
insufficient to supply his wants. It sometimes happens that the most fertile
soil is found

along the margin or in the neighborhood of the small
rivulet, and sandy and barren land beside the larger stream. To apply the rule
contended for

would prevent the useful and profitable cultivation of the
productive soil, and sanction the waste of water upon the more sterile lands.
It would

have enabled a party to locate upon a stream in 1875, and
destroy the value of thousands of acres, and the improvements thereon, in
adjoining

valleys, possessed and cultivated for the preceding decade.
Under the principle contended for, a party owning land ten miles from the
stream, but

in the valley thereof, might deprive a prior appropriator of
the water diverted therefrom whose lands are within a thousand yards, but just
beyond

an intervening divide.

We cannot believe that any legislative body within the
territory or state of Colorado ever intended these consequences to flow from a
statute

enacted. Yet two sections are relied upon by counsel as
practically producing them. These sections are as follows:

All persons who claim, own or hold a possessory right or
title to any land or parcel of land within the boundary of Colorado territory,

... when those claims are on the bank, margin or
neighborhood of any stream of water, creek or river, shall be entitled to the
use of the

water of said stream, creek or river for the purposes of
irrigation, and making said claims available to the full extent of the soil,
for

agricultural purposes. Session Laws 1861, p. 67, § 1.

Nor shall the water of any stream be diverted from its
original channel to the detriment of any miner, millmen or others along the
line

of said stream, and there shall be at all times left
sufficient water in said stream for the use of miners and farmers along said
stream.

Latter part of § 13, p. 48, Session Laws 1862.

The two statutory provisions above quoted must, for the
purpose of this discussion, be construed together. The phrase “along said
stream,”

in the latter, is equally comprehensive, as to the extent of
territory, with the expression “on the bank, margin or neighborhood,” used in
the

former, and both include all lands in the immediate valley
of the stream. The latter provision sanctions the diversion of water from one
stream to

irrigate lands adjacent to another, provided such diversion
is not to the “detriment” of parties along the line of the stream from which
the water

#321

is taken. If there is any conflict between the statutes in
this respect, the latter, of course, must prevail. We think that the “use” and
“detriment”

spoken of are a use existing at the time of the diversion,
and a detriment immediately resulting therefrom. We do not believe that the
legislature

intended to prohibit the diversion of water to the
“detriment” of parties who might at some future period conclude to settle upon
the stream; nor

do we think that they were legislating with a view to
preserving in such stream sufficient water for the “use” of settlers who might
never come,

and consequently never have use therefor.

But “detriment” at the time of diversion could only exist
where the water diverted had been previously appropriated or used; if there had

been no previous appropriation or use thereof, there could
be no present injury or “ detriment .”

Our conclusion above as to the intent of the legislature is
supported by the fact that the succeeding assembly, in 1864, hastened to insert
into

the latter statute, without other change or amendment, the
clause, “ who have a priority of right ,” in connection with the idea of “
detriment ” to

adjacent owners. This amendment of the statute was simply
the acknowledgment by the legislature of a doctrine already existing, under
which

rights had accrued that were entitled to protection. In the
language of Mr. Justice Miller, above quoted, upon a different branch of the
same

subject, it “was rather a voluntary recognition of a
pre-existing right constituting a valid claim, than the creation of a new one.”

expressed,

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Is the Colorado Supreme Court’s exercise in statutory
interpretation convincing? Do the legal principles laid down by the Colorado
legislature in

1861 and 1862 sound all that different from those applied as
a matter of common law in the _Evans_ case? Recall that the Oregon Supreme
Court’s

decision in _Thornton_ , supra, which declared a customary
public right to use the dry sand beach, was later challenged as a judicial
taking. Did the

Colorado Supreme Court commit a taking by eliminating the
riparian water rights Coffin had under Colorado law when he acquired the
property?

2 .The “Colorado doctrine,” or prior appropriation, appears
to move a long way toward recognizing water as a full-fledged private property
right.

Water rights are now based on a version of the first-in-time
approach that is characteristic of original acquisition of other types of
property rights, such

as rights to wild animals or abandoned property. Moreover,
in contrast to natural flow theory or the reasonable use doctrine, prior
appropriation

unambiguously permits the first appropriator to take all of
the water in the stream. And of course, as _Coffin_ holds, prior appropriation
permits water to

be severed from riparian land and even transported into
another watershed. Yet notwithstanding these differences, it would be
inaccurate to characterize

prior appropriation as treating water like any other
commodity. In addition to _de facto_ and _de jure_ restrictions on sales of
water rights (see Note 6 infra),

the prior appropriation doctrine incorporates notions of
proper use: Generally speaking, only “beneficial uses” of appropriated water
are permitted. As in

the case of “reasonable use,” it is difficult to state with
certainty exactly what it means to be a beneficial use. The most famous example
cited to show

what is not beneficial is using water to flood gophers off
one’s land. See Tulare Irrigation District v. Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation
District, 45 P. 2 d 972 ,

1007 (Cal. 1935 ). That helps.

3 .In practice, prior appropriation systems are more of a
governance regime than an exclusion regime. Henry E. Smith, Governing Water:
The

Semicommons of Fluid Property Rights, 50 Ariz. L. Rev. 445 (
2008 ). And with increasingly interconnected and regulated water rights, even
in riparian

states, the governance approach is perhaps becoming even
more pronounced. See Eric T. Freyfogle, Context and Accommodation in Modern
Property

Law, 41 Stan. L. Rev. 1529 , 1530 ( 1989 ). Traditionally,
prior appropriation rights gave a right to use water in a certain way for a
certain period of time—

rather than a right to a certain volume of water. This helps
explain the often-decried doctrine that an appropriator who stops using the
water or whose

use becomes more efficient has no rights in the excess
water. See 2 Waters and Water Rights § 12. 03 (c)( 2 ) (Robert E. Beck ed.,
1991 ). Given the

complexity of the problem and the need to adjust
interlocking rights, equity has played an important role in prior appropriation
law. Duane Rudolph,

Why Prior Appropriation Needs Equity, 18 U. Denver Water L.
Rev. 348 ( 2015 ).

4 .One limit on well-defined entitlements to water is the
measurement technology available. In an earlier era the “miner’s inch” was
used, which

involved forcing water through a one-inch square orifice
under conditions that were neither easily controlled nor standardized. See
George

```



323



```

A. Gould & Douglas L. Grant, Cases and Materials on
Water Law 11 – 12 ( 6 th ed. 2000 ). The uncertainty associated with
measurement technology

probably helps explain the requirement of beneficial use: It
was easier to monitor uses than to measure flows of water. Today, the official
statutory

measure in most western states is the cubic foot per second
(“second foot” or “cfs”), which is measured with various meters and
registers—and more

recently with satellite monitors.

5 .One frequent explanation of the tendency for western
states to adopt some variant of prior appropriation is that in the arid West,
water is more

valuable and hence private property rights in water are more
worthwhile. Eastern reasonable use doctrine and western prior appropriation
then become a

classic Demsetzian story. See, e.g., Terry L. Anderson &
P.J. Hill, The Evolution of Property Rights: A Study of the American West, 18
J.L. & Econ.

163 , 176 – 78 ( 1975 ). A recent empirical study finds that
prior appropriation in Colorado established between 1852 and 2013 was
associated with a

doubling of infrastructure investment and a substantial
increase in agricultural output. Bryan Leonard & Gary D. Libecap,
Collective Action by

Contract: Prior Appropriation and the Development of
Irrigation in the Western United States, 62 J.L. & Econ. 67 ( 2019 ).

Additionally, once the potential set of rightholders in the
West was no longer limited to riparian owners or even to those whose lands were
located

in the same watershed, some limiting principle was needed in
order to prevent water rights from becoming so finely subdivided as to be of
little value.

See Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Growth of the Law 117 – 20 (
1924 ); David B. Schorr, Appropriation as Agrarianism: Distributive Justice in
the Creation

of Property Rights, 32 Ecology L.Q. 3 ( 2005 ). This was
also a major concern in mining camps, out of which western water law grew.

```



On the other hand, as Carol Rose has pointed out, the uses
to which water was put in the two areas was different:



Western water rights evolved from uses of water that were
essentially consumptive. Some of these were power uses, such as forced-



water hosing of offstream mining slopes, while other uses
included such partial consumption as irrigation. * * * [W]estern water uses * *
*



consumed the water * * * because they took the water away
from the stream and did not return it, or at least much of it. * * *



But eastern riparian rights did not grow up around these
consumptive uses of water, even though consumptive uses were sometimes at



issue. Eastern riparian rights grew up around the use of
water for power—that is—instream power—which is not necessarily a zero-sum



game. * * * [I]f I have a mill on the river, and you do too,
we can both use the water as it flows by—provided that we do so carefully and
do



not, for example, alternately interrupt and pour out the
water in such a way as to disrupt the millworks downstream. * * *

[T]he point of riparian law was to place boundaries on these
necessarily consumptive aspects of water flow use, holding them within



“reasonable” and commonly accepted bounds so that the bulk
of the water flow would be left intact. What I am suggesting, of course, is
that



eastern riparian law evolved from an aspect of water use,
namely, power, that has aspects of a public good, quite unlike the individually



consumptive uses of water that are characteristic of the
West. * * *

Carol M. Rose, Energy and Efficiency in the Realignment of
Common-Law Water Rights, 19 J. Legal Stud. 261 , 290 – 92 ( 1990 ). Which of
the foregoing

explanations for the emergence of the Colorado doctrine or
western appropriation theory is more convincing? Are they incompatible?
Consider the

conflict in _Evans v. Merriweather_ again in light of Rose’s
account.

6 .One of the most contentious issues these days is the
marketing of water rights. Whether water rights can be sold has always been
controversial,

and the law on the subject has wavered over time. Today,
prior appropriation regimes generally allow sales of water rights unless the
sale would impose

unwanted effects on third parties such as downstream users
of the return flow. The fact that water can fetch much higher prices in urban
areas than in

areas of longstanding agricultural use has led to posturing
and bitter political conflict, most notoriously in Los Angeles’s purchase of
water rights from

farmers in the Owens Valley. Compare William L. Kahrl, Water
and Power: The Conflict over Los Angeles’ Water Supply in the Owens Valley (
1982 )

(arguing that the transfers were coercive and devastated the
Owens Valley) with Gary D. Libecap, Owens Valley Revisited: A Reassessment of
the

West’s First Great Water Transfer ( 2007 ) (arguing that the
transfers benefited Owens Valley owners but they received prices closer to
value of land in

agricultural rather than municipal use). There is a
discernible trend now in the direction of market-alienability. What is the
problem with commodifying

water in the first place?

7 .Acquiring rights for instream uses, such as rafting or
fishing is another live issue in western states today. If water is
market-alienable, why not

let those who would like to enjoy uninterrupted flow
purchase the rights? Traditionally, under prior appropriation, a claim for
instream use would not

count as an appropriation for beneficial use, perhaps
because of a lack of environmental concern or difficulty in delineating
instream rights. More

recently, western states have been amending their water laws
to provide for rights for instream users. In addition, the public trust
doctrine (see supra Part

D. 2 ) can sometimes unexpectedly cause nonconsumptive uses
to trump longstanding appropriative rights. See National Audubon Society v.
Superior

Court, 658 P. 2 d 709 (Cal. 1983 ) (Mono Lake). What is the
best way to integrate newfound demand for instream flows into the mosaic of
water rights?

8 .Water is not the only resource that is hard to delimit
and to specify for purposes of defining rights. (See the material on oil and
gas in Chapter II

and wind and solar in Chapter IX.) The metaphor of
“fugitive” resources has often been criticized, but it may reflect the
difficulty that courts as

institutions have in addressing problems involving certain
resources.

Another perennially difficult resource is the radio
spectrum, made famous in law and economics by Ronald Coase. R. H. Coase, The

Communications Commission. 2 J.L. & Econ. 1 ( 1959 ).
The spectrum can be put to many uses, from television, to wireless
communication, to GPS,

with new uses being devised all the time. Here too, methods
of delineation that look like use rights versus others that resemble
“parcels”—compare

riparianism versus prior appropriation—have been proposed
for radio spectrum. Thomas W. Merrill & Henry E. Smith, Making Coasean

Coasean, 54 J.L. & Econ. S 77 , S 83 – 86 ( 2011 ). And
as with water, the political conflicts over radio spectrum have been epic. See
Thomas Winslow

Hazlett, The Political Spectrum: The Tumultuous Liberation
of Wireless Technology, from Herbert Hoover to the Smartphone ( 2017 ).

Diffuse Surface Water

What about surface water that is not in a defined channel,
or what is sometimes termed “casual water?” Under the “common enemy”

doctrine, first adopted in Luther v. Winnisimmet Co. , 63
Mass. (9 Cush.) 171 (1851), each landowner has an absolute right to use
self-help to

repel inflows of these waters—that is, to combat the “common
enemy” of surface water—even if this causes damaging flooding to other

landowners. 2 Waters and Water Rights § 10.03(b)(1) (Robert
E. Berk ed., 1991 ed., 2000 replacement vol., 2001); 5 Waters and Water Rights

§ 59.02(b)(2). But if one landowner uses self-help to repel
the water and causes the surface water to flow to a second owner’s land, the
second

owner is similarly privileged to try to send the water back.
Neither can sue the other. More recently, as conflicts have grown, the common
enemy

doctrine has been modified (or supplanted) by judicial
policing for reasonableness. Again, we can discern a trend from a trespass-like
doctrine

(absolute privilege to repel invasions) to a more
nuisance-like doctrine (arbitrating the rights of the parties under a broad
context-sensitive

reasonableness standard).

Kansas City Court of Appeals, Missouri, 1971.



469 S.W. 2 d 859.



```

■
SHANGLER, PRESIDING JUDGE. This appeal is from a judgment dismissing
plaintiffs’ Petition for Declaratory Judgment and Injunction. The

judgment of dismissal was entered upon defendant City’s
Motion to Dismiss which alleged that plaintiffs’ petition failed to plead
either a

justiciable controversy or any claim upon which relief could
be granted. The questions raised on this appeal are: whether the averments of
the

petition entitle plaintiffs, to a judicial declaration of
their rights to the percolating waters underlying their lands, and if so,
whether defendant

#326

City’s threatened use of the percolating waters is such an
infringement of those rights as will be enjoined by equity.

The facts alleged and in substance shown by the petition of
plaintiffs, now appellants, are these: Appellants are the several owners of
some

6000 acres of farm land overlying an alluvial water basin in
Boone County known as the McBaine Bottom. These lands (projected on Exhibit

“A” appended hereto [Figure 3-5]) extend from Huntsdale at
the north to Easley at the south; they are bordered by a line of limestone
bluffs on

the east and are enclosed by a sweeping bend of the Missouri
River on the west. Underlying this entire plain are strata of porous rock,
gravel and

soil through which water, without apparent or definite
channel, filtrates, oozes and percolates as it falls. This water (much of which
has

originated far upstream within the Missouri River Valley)
has been trapped by an underlying stratum of impervious limestone so that the

saturated soil has become a huge aquifer or underground
reservoir.

Appellants have devoted the overlying lands to agricultural
use with excellent resultant yields. They attribute the fertility of the soil
to the

continuing presence of a high subterranean water level which
has unfailingly and directly supplied the moisture needs of the crops whatever
the

vagaries of the weather. Appellants also use the underground
water for personal consumption, for their livestock, and in the near future
will

require it for the surface irrigation of their crops.

Respondent City of Columbia is a burgeoning municipality of
50,000 inhabitants which has been, since 1948, in quest of a source of water

to replenish a dwindling supply. Following the advice of
consulting engineers, it settled on a plan for the withdrawal of water by
shallow wells

from beneath the McBaine Bottom where appellants’ farms are
located and thence to transport the water to the City some twelve miles away
for

sale to customers within and without the City. In December
of 1966, the electorate approved a revenue bond issue for the development of a

municipal water supply by such a system of shallow wells in
the McBaine Bottom. Further scientific analysis and measurement of the basin’s

water resources followed. With the aid of a test well, it
was determined that the underground percolating water table, when undisturbed,
rises to

an average of ten feet below the soil surface. These waters
move laterally through the McBaine alluvium at the rate of two feet per day and
in so

doing displace 10.5 million gallons of water daily.

#327

Figure 3-5

Exhibit A in Higday v. Nickolaus

Respondent City, by threat of condemnation, has acquired
from some of these appellants five well sites totalling 17.25 acres. The City
now

threatens to extract the groundwater at the rate of 1 1.5
million gallons daily for purposes wholly unrelated to any beneficial use of
the overlying

land, but instead, intends to transport the water to its
corporate boundaries some miles away for purposes of sale. The mining of the
water as

contemplated will reduce the water table throughout the
basin from the present average of ten feet to a new subsurface average of
twenty feet.

Appellants complain that this reduction of the water table
will divert percolating waters normally available and enjoyed by appellants for
their

crops, livestock and their personal use and will eventually
turn their land into an arid and sterile surface.

#328

On the basis of these pleaded allegations, plaintiffs sought
(1) a judicial declaration that defendant City is without right to extract the

percolating waters for sale away from the premises or for
other use not related with any beneficial ownership or enjoyment of the land
from

which they are taken when to do so will deprive them, the
owners of the adjacent land, of the reasonable use of the underground water for
the

beneficial use of their own land, and (2) that defendant
City be enjoined from undertaking to do so. * * *

The facts pleaded show the City’s design to exploit the
McBaine Bottom as the principal source of the municipal water supply has
advanced

to the point where well sites have been acquired on land
adjacent to that held by plaintiffs. (The City acknowledges in its brief that
it has

committed almost $5,000,000 to this project, that it has
acquired the sites for wells and a water treatment plant, and that the laying
of water lines

is virtually completed.) When the wells become operative,
the City claims the right to withdraw groundwater in any quantity at will, for
sale,

even though damages may result to plaintiffs. * * *

Respondent maintains that since Springfield Waterworks Co.
v. Jenkins, 62 Mo.App. 74, was decided by the St. Louis Court of Appeals in

1895, Missouri has recognized the common law rule that a
landowner has absolute ownership to the waters under his land and, therefore,
may

without liability withdraw any quantity of water for any
purpose even though the result is to drain all water from beneath his
neighbors’ lands.

Therefore, contends respondent, since the threatened damage
plaintiffs plead describes a consequence of the rightful use by respondent of
its

land, it is damnum absque injuria and not actionable. * * *

It is fundamental that injunction will not be granted unless
there is some substantial right to be protected. The indispensable basis for

injunctive relief is the wrongful and injurious invasion of
some legal right existing in plaintiff. The writ will issue also if invasion of
that right is

threatened by one having the power to do the wrong. Whether
plaintiffs’ allegations that the defendant municipality threatens to capture
the

percolating waters from their subjacent lands for purposes
of sale in such quantities as will damage them describe an invasion of legal
right

which equity will enjoin depends upon whether plaintiffs
have a right of property in these waters. The answer to that question, in turn,
depends

upon the rule to be applied to the ownership and use of
subterranean percolating waters.

In legal contemplation, subterranean waters fall into two
classifications, either underground streams or percolating waters.^2 An

#329

underground stream is defined as water that passes through
or under the surface in a definite channel or one that is reasonably
ascertainable.

Percolating waters include all waters which pass through the
ground beneath the surface of the earth without a definite channel and not
shown to

be supplied by a definite flowing stream. They are waters
which ooze, seep, filter and otherwise circulate through the interstices of the
subsurface

strata without definable channel, or in a course that is not
discoverable from surface indications without excavation for that purpose. The
rule is

that all underground waters are presumed to be percolating
and therefore the burden of proof is on the party claiming that a subterranean
stream

exists. Maricopa County Municipal Water Conservation Dist.
No. 1 v. Southwest Cotton Co., 4 P.2d 369, 376 (Ariz. 1931); C & W Coal
Corp. v.

Salyer, 104 S.E.2d 50, 53 (Va. 1958); Wilkening v. State,
344 P.2d 204, 206 (Wash. 1959).

The law with respect to rights in percolating waters was not
developed until a comparatively recent period.^3 Under the English common law

rule, percolating waters constitute part and parcel of the
land in which they are found and belong absolutely to the owner of such land
who may

without liability withdraw any quantity of water for any
purpose even though the result is to drain all water from beneath the adjoining
lands.

Under this rule, a municipality [owning] land may collect
the underlying percolating waters and use them to supply its inhabitants
regardless of

the effect on adjoining landowners.

The English rule relating to percolating groundwater was
generally followed by American courts through the mid-nineteenth century,

although not always with the full rigor of the absolute
ownership doctrine. At an early day, the courts expressed dissatisfaction with
the English

common law rule and began applying what has come to be known
variously, as the rule of “reasonable use”, or of “correlative rights”, or the

“American rule.”^4 By the turn of the century, a steady
trend of decisions was discernible away from the English rule to a rule of
reasonable use.

The trend continues.^6

Generally, the rule of reasonable use is an expression of
the maxim that one must so use his own property as not to injure another—that

each landowner is restricted to a reasonable exercise of his
own rights and a reasonable use of his own property, in view of the similar
rights of

others. As it applies to percolating groundwater, the rule
of reasonable use

#330

recognizes that the overlying owner has a proprietary
interest in the water under his lands, but his incidents of ownership are
restricted. It

recognizes that the nature of the property right is
usufructuary rather than absolute as under the English rule. Under the rule of
reasonable use,

the overlying owner may use the subjacent groundwater
freely, and without liability to an adjoining owner, but only if his use is for
purposes

incident to the beneficial enjoyment of the land from which
the water was taken. This rule does not prevent the consumption of such
groundwater

for agriculture, manufacturing, irrigation, mining or any
purpose by which a landowner might legitimately use and enjoy his land, even
though in

doing so he may divert or drain the groundwater of his
neighbor.

The principal difficulty in the application of the
reasonable use doctrine is in determining what constitutes a reasonable use.
What is a

reasonable use must depend to a great extent upon many
factors, such as the persons involved, their relative positions, the nature of
their uses, the

comparative value of their uses, the climatic conditions,
and all facts and circumstances pertinent to the issues. Bristor v. Cheatham,
255 P.2d

173, 179 (Ariz. 1953); Bollinger v. Henry, 375 S.W.2d 161,
166 (Mo. 1964).^8 However, the modern decisions agree that under the rule of

reasonable use an overlying owner, including a municipality,
may not withdraw percolating water and transport it for sale or other use away

from the land from which it was taken if the result is to
impair the supply of an adjoining landowner to his injury. Such a use is
unreasonable

because non-beneficial and “is not for a ‘lawful purpose
within the general rule concerning percolating waters, but constitutes an
actionable

wrong for which damages are recoverable’ ”. Bristor v.
Cheatham, supra, 255 P.2d at 178; Canada v. City of Shawnee, 64 P.2d 694 (Okla.
1936);

Forbell v. City of New York, 58 N.E. 644, 646 (N.Y. 1900);
Rothrauff v. Sinking Spring Water Co., 14 A.2d 87, 90 (Pa. 1940); Meeker v.
City of

East Orange, 74 A. 379, 385 (N.J. 1909); and cases listed in
55 A.L.R. 1404.

The “reasonable use” rule as developed in the law of ground
waters must be distinguished from the “correlative rights” rule. In 1902, the

California Supreme Court repudiated the English common law
rule in favor of the distinctive correlative rights doctrine which is based on
the

theory of proportionate sharing of withdrawals among
landowners overlying a common basin.^9 Under the doctrine, overlying owners
have no

proprietary interest in the water under their soil.
California remains the only important correlative rights state; Utah has
abandoned it, and only

Nebraska also applies it to some extent.^10 The
administration of such a system of rights has proved extremely difficult in
times of water

#331

shortage and has tendered towards an “equalitarian rigidity”
which does not take into account the relative value of the competing uses.
However

suitable this doctrine may be for California—the prime
consumer of ground water in the country—or any other state which may follow it,
the

reasonable use rule offers a more flexible legal standard
for the just determination of beneficial uses of ground water, particularly
under the

climatic conditions of Missouri.

Respondent City contends that the English common law rule of
absolute ownership of percolating waters governs in Missouri by virtue of

statute and judicial decision. The City seems to suggest
that since the Territorial Laws of 1816 adopted the common law as the rule of
action and

decision in this state and present Sec. 1.010 V.A.M.S.
continues that legislative policy, we have no power to change or abrogate it.
As we have

already noted, Acton v. Blundell (marginal reference 3,
supra), which is generally cited as having established the “English common law”
rule of

percolating waters, was decided in 1843 long after the
Territorial Laws of 1816 were enacted. And not until 1860 was it decided that,
without

liability to an adjoining owner, an overlying owner might
exhaust the groundwater to furnish a municipal water supply. Thus, there was no
law of

any kind on the subject at the time the common law was
adopted by statute in this state. The subsequent English decisions declaring
the common

law on percolating waters are no more binding on us than the
decisions of any court of another state. There is no impediment of inherited

doctrine to our determination of the question presented
according to the justice of the case.

The Missouri law of groundwater rests on a single case,
Springfield Waterworks Company v. Jenkins, 62 Mo.App. 74, decided by the St.

Louis Court of Appeals in 1895. Respondent City contends the
holding in that case “reaffirms the English or Common Law Rule as to

percolating waters and (that) this is the final word in
Missouri on the subject.” * * * We do not share respondent City’s confidence
that this

decision either announces or follows the common law doctrine
on the subject. * * *

The intervening three-quarters of a century since
Springfield Waterworks Company v. Jenkins, supra, has seen for Missouri a
significant

urban, industrial and population increase and with it
greater demands upon a relatively static water supply. In the past such water
disputes as have

been brought to our courts usually have arisen “from factual
situations pertaining to the existence of too much rather than too little
water”.

Bollinger v. Henry, supra, 375 S.W.2d at 165. The
controversy between respondent City and plaintiffs over the McBaine Bottom
groundwater,

however, is prompted by a scarcity, not an excess, of water
to supply the vital needs of both. It is a competition which is destined to
recur

between other municipalities and landowners as present
sources of municipal water supplies diminish and the need for them increases.
In such

circumstances, appeals to a dogma of absolute

#332

ownership of groundwater without consideration of the rights
of adjoining landowners seem unpersuasive.

Also, since Springfield Waterworks v. Jenkins, supra, the
science of groundwater hydrology has come into existence and has proven the

postulates of the common law rule to be unsound. The premise
that the owner of the soil owns all that lies beneath the surface so that he
may use

the percolating water in any way he chooses without
liability to an adjoining owner fails to recognize that the supply of
groundwater is limited,

and that the first inherent limitation on water rights is
the availability of the supply.^14 Another postulate of the common law doctrine
ascribes to

percolating waters a movement so “secret, changeable and
uncontrollable”, that no attempt to subject them to fixed legal rules could be

successfully made. Chatfield v. Wilson, 28 Vt. 49, 53
(1855); Frazier v. Brown, 12 Ohio St. 294 (1861). Modern knowledge and
techniques have

discredited this premise also. The movement, supply, rate of
evaporation and many other physical characteristics of groundwater are now
readily

determinable. * * *

Recently, in Bollinger v. Henry, supra, 375 S.W.2d at 166,
the Supreme Court of Missouri applied the rule of reasonable use to determine

the rights of riparian owners. Subterranean streams are
governed by the rules applying to natural watercourses on the surface, so the
rule of

reasonable use is now applicable to them also. 93 C.J.S.
Waters § 89; 56 Am.Jur., Waters, Sec. 109; Springfield Waterworks Co. v.
Jenkins,

supra, 62 Mo.App. at 80. We believe the same rule should
apply to subterranean percolating waters. Jones v. Oz-Ark-Val Poultry Company,
306

S.W.2d 111 , 113 (Ark. 1957); Wrathall v. Johnson, 40 P.2d
755, 776 (Utah 1935). It is that legal standard, in absence of a statutory
expression of

a priority of uses, by which existing water resources may be
allocated most equitably and beneficially among competing users, private and

public. The application of such a uniform legal standard
would also give recognition to the established interrelationship between
surface and

groundwater and would, therefore, bring into one
classification all waters over the use of which controversy may arise.

Under the rule of reasonable use as we have stated it, the
fundamental measure of the overlying owner’s right to use the groundwater is

whether it is for purposes incident to the beneficial
enjoyment of the land from which it was taken. Thus, a private owner may not
withdraw

groundwater for purposes of sale if the adjoining landowner
is thereby deprived of water necessary for the beneficial enjoyment of his
land. Katz

v. Walkinshaw, 74 P. 766 (Cal. 1902). Here, the municipality
has acquired miniscule plots of earth and by the use of powerful pumps intends
to

draw into wells on its own land for merchandising
groundwater stored in plaintiffs’ land, thereby depriving plaintiffs of the
beneficial use of the

normal water table to their

#333

immediate injury and to the eventual impoverishment of their
lands. “There is no apparent reason for saying that, because defendant is a

municipal corporation, seeking water for the inhabitants of
a city, it may therefore do what a private owner of land may not do. The city
is a

private owner of this land, and the furnishing of water to
its inhabitants is its private business. It is imperative that the people of
the city have

water; it is not imperative that they secure it at the
expense of those owning lands adjoining lands owned by the city.” Schenk v.
City of Ann

Arbor, 163 N.W. 109, 114 (Mich. 1917). Under the rule we
apply, however, plaintiffs could have no basis for complaint if the City of
Columbia’s

withdrawals of groundwater for municipal purposes from the
McBaine Bottom do not interfere with plaintiffs’ beneficial use of such water.

Under the facts pleaded, the water table could be maintained
at its normal level and damage to plaintiffs avoided if the City were to limit
its

withdrawals to such quantity as would not exceed the daily
recharge rate of 10.5 million gallons. If, on the other hand, the City
perseveres in its

declared intention to mine the water by at least one million
gallons per day, it will become accountable to plaintiffs for [whatever] injury
results

from such diversion. * * *

This is not to suggest that should proof follow upon the
pleadings, perforce injunction will issue. Injunctive relief is a matter of
grace, not of

right. “The writ of injunction is an extraordinary remedy.
It does not issue as a matter of course, but somewhat at the discretion of the
chancellor.

It is his duty to consider its effect upon all parties in
interest, and to issue it only in case it is necessary to protect a substantial
right, and even

then not against great public interest .” (Emphasis
supplied) Smith v. City of Sedalia, 149 S.W. 597, 601 (Mo. 1912); Johnson v.
Independent

School Dist. No. 1, 199 S.W.2d 421, 424 (Mo. Ct. App. 1947);
43 C.J.S. Injunctions § 31. It requires the application of the principles of
equity

under all the circumstances. * * *

The rule of comparative injury suggests that under the facts
pleaded and concessions of counsel it may be more equitable to deny injunctive

relief than to grant it. * * *

The City has resisted plaintiffs’ requested declaratory and
injunctive relief on the theory that the common law rule of absolute ownership
of

percolating waters has governed its relationship with
plaintiffs and, therefore, any damage to them could not be a legal injury. It
has not sought to

exercise its power of eminent domain to acquire the right to
withdraw water from beneath plaintiffs’ lands doubtless on the premise that it
was

under no duty to do so. Should the trial court adjudge that
plaintiffs are entitled to the declarations they seek, the rule of reasonable
use will apply

and defendant City will be answerable to plaintiffs for any
damage from its unreasonable use of groundwater. Should the trial court adjudge

injunctive relief for plaintiffs appropriate, it would be
well within its discretion to condition the imposition of that restraint upon
the exercise by

the City within a reasonable time, of its power of eminent

#334

domain to acquire the water rights it has been violating.
Failing that, plaintiffs would still have available to them a remedy in the
nature of an

inverse condemnation for any damage caused by the City’s
unreasonable use.

The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views we have expressed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The English Rule of _Acton v. Blundell_ , also termed the
absolute ownership rule, gives the owner of land an absolute right to use as
much

percolating groundwater as he pleases. The owner is
privileged to pump within the space defined by the _ad coelum_ rule. The
American Rule of

reasonable use can be seen as an application of the
principle of another famous maxim, _sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas_ , “use
your property in such a

way as not to injure another’s.” Under this approach, what
constitutes an injury (or conversely what is a proper use) must be defined. How
would you

characterize these approaches in terms of the distinction
between trespass and nuisance, or exclusion and governance (see Chapter I)?

2 .The court here hints strongly that if the City is found
to divert groundwater in excess of the natural recharge rate, it will be liable
for damages

but not an injunction. Would the same conclusion follow in a
future case when the applicable rule is clearer? What if the diversion had been
for a

privately owned manufacturing plant rather than a municipal
water system?

3 .The problem of groundwater pumping is somewhat
reminiscent of the common pool in oil and gas. Although oil and gas flow
somewhat

differently, there is still potential for a tragedy of the
commons. Solutions to the common-pool problem with oil and gas have typically
been late in

coming and only partially successful. See Chapter II.A. 3.

by using only cell lines accompanied by documentation

of the source’s consent. (Dis. opn. of Mosk, J., post.) But
consent forms do not come with guarantees of validity. As medical malpractice
litigation shows, challenges to the validity and

sufficiency of consent are not uncommon. Moreover, it is
sheer fantasy to hope that waivers might be obtained for the thousands of cell
lines and tissue samples presently in cell repositories

and, for that reason, already in wide use among researchers.

(^6) The English law on customary rights grew up in a small
island nation at a time when most inhabitants lived and died without traveling
more than a day’s walk from their birthplace.

Most of the customary rights recorded in English cases are
local in scope. The English had many cultural and language groups which
eventually merged into a nation. After these groups

developed their own unique customs, the unified nation
recognized some of them as law. Some American scholars, looking at the vast
geography of this continent and the freshness of its

civilization, have concluded that there is no need to look
to English customary rights as a source of legal rights in this country. See,
e.g., 6 Powell, Real Property § 934 , note 5 , at 362 ( 1949 ).

Some of the generalizations drawn by the text writers from
English cases would tend to limit customary rights to specific usages in
English towns and villages. See Gray, The Rule Against

Perpetuities §§ 572 – 588 ( 1942 ). But it does not follow
that a custom, established in fact, cannot have regional application and be
enjoyed by a larger public than the inhabitants of a single

village.

## CHAPTER IV

# OWNER SOVEREIGNTY AND ITS LIMITS

As we saw in Chapter I, Blackstone referred to property with
some hyperbole as “that sole and despotic dominion which one man claims

and exercises over the external things of the world, in
total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe.” 2
William Blackstone,

Commentaries on the Laws of England *2. In a famous essay
written in the Legal Realist era, Morris Cohen agreed that property is a kind
of

delegated sovereignty over particular resources. Morris R.
Cohen, Property and Sovereignty, 13 Cornell L.Q. 8 (1927). But while Blackstone

celebrated owner sovereignty, Cohen warned against
conferring too much power on individuals over resources, and argued that the
general

public, speaking through the sovereign government, should be
able to make extensive modifications to owner sovereignty. In this Chapter, we

consider in greater detail the extent to which property
ownership conveys a type of sovereign authority over things. We start by
surveying the

various ways in which the law recognizes and protects the
right of an owner to exclude others from her “thing.” We then consider various
limits

on owner sovereignty, including necessity, custom, public
accommodations laws, public policy, and antidiscrimination laws. This is
followed by

a consideration of the law of equity, which bears on owner
sovereignty in multiple ways, expanding owner powers in some respects and

qualifying them in others. Finally, we consider other basic
powers that are often associated with owner sovereignty, such as the power to
include

others (license), the power to transfer possession but not
ownership (bailment), and the power to abandon or destroy property.

### A. PROTECTING OWNER SOVEREIGNTY

If property entails, at least in its core signification, the
right to exclude others from some thing, then it is important to consider the
ways in

which the law protects this exclusion right. Property owners
are in fact given a considerable arsenal of weapons to vindicate their right to
exclude

others.

### 1 .CRIMINAL LAWS

By convention the criminal laws that protect property are
studied in criminal law courses, not property courses, so we will not attempt

anything like comprehensive treatment here. Yet it is
important not to lose sight of the fact that the criminal law provides
extensive protection to

property, and that these protections reinforce the civil
remedies that traditionally have received attention in property courses. The
criminal

#336

law “backstopping” of ownership rights is arguably critical
to the maintenance of a system of private property. If property owners were
left solely

to their civil remedies, they might be easily overwhelmed or
exhausted by the need to enforce those rights, particularly if violations
became

numerous or persistent. Another reason for providing
criminal law protection of property rights is to utilize the police as an
agency for enforcing

exclusion rights where self-help (such as trying to evict
intruders or chase down thieves) would present a high risk of violence and
injury to all

concerned (including owners and even third parties).

a.CRIMINAL LAWS PROTECTING PERSONAL PROPERTY

At common law, personal property was protected by the
criminal law of larceny, which prohibited the taking of personal property from
the

possession of another without legal authority. Possession,
as you should be aware by now, can be tricky to define.

A conventional explanation for the “taking from possession”
element of larceny is that the law was more concerned with protecting persons

than the ownership of things:

The principal factor which limited the scope of larceny was
the requirement that the thief must take it from the victim’s possession;

larceny requires a “trespass in the taking,” as the matter
is often stated. The judges who determined the scope of larceny (including its

limitations) apparently considered larceny to be a crime
designed to prevent breaches of the peace rather than aimed at protecting

property from wrongful appropriation. The unauthorized
taking of property, even by stealth, from the owner’s possession is apt to

produce an altercation if the owner discovers the property
moving out of his possession in the hands of the thief. But when the

wrongdoer already has the owner’s property in his possession
at the time he misappropriates it (today’s embezzlement) or when he

obtains the property from the owner by telling him lies (now
the crime of false pretenses) there is not the same danger of an immediate

breach of the peace. Upon learning how he has been wronged
the owner may be as angry at the wrongdoer in these two situations as he

is at the thief caught in the act of taking his property by
stealth, but the malefactor in these two cases is generally less available for

retaliatory measures than when the owner discovers him in
the process of taking the property out of his possession.

Wayne R. LaFave, Criminal Law § 19.1(a) (6th ed. 2017)
(footnote omitted). Courts and later legislatures kept adding to the inventory
of

property offenses, often through various “constructive
possession” theories. Does this process of evolution tend to undermine the
story about the

primary concern of the criminal law being the protection of
persons rather than ownership of things? At the same time, the law of larceny
broadly

moved from a focus on taking or asportation to “intent.”
George

#337

P. Fletcher, The Metamorphosis of Larceny, 89 Harv. L. Rev.
469 (1976). Nevertheless courts still require some physical movement of the

property to establish larceny.

Other than larceny and related offenses, personal property
is covered by a complex menu of criminal prohibitions. Takings of personal

property that directly endanger persons are often punished
under the rubric of robbery , which is the common-law crime of larceny with the
added

element that the property is taken from the possession of
the victim using force or by putting the victim in fear of immediate serious
bodily

injury. See Model Penal Code § 222.1. Persons who damage,
but do not take, personal property can be charged with the crime of criminal

mischief. Id. § 220.3.

Controversially, some intentional infringements of
intellectual property rights are subject to criminal sanctions; American
copyright law

includes criminal penalties for copyright infringement, but
patent law and trademark law do not. For commentary, see Stuart P. Green,

Plagiarism, Norms, and the Limits of Theft Law: Some
Observations on the Use of Criminal Sanctions in Enforcing Intellectual
Property Rights,

54 Hastings L.J. 167, 209–16 (2002); Cheng Lim Saw, The Case
for Criminalizing Primary Infringements of Copyright—Perspectives from

Singapore, 18 Int’l J.L. & Info Tech. 95 (2010).

Questions have also been raised recently how if at all theft
offenses should cover intangibles more generally. Possession traditionally
could

only be exercised over tangibles. Some have proposed that
possession should be extended to intangibles or that theft offenses should be

decoupled from possession. Although special statutes deal
with a number of computer-related crimes, trespass-related motions play some
role.

See Orin S. Kerr, Cybercrime’s Scope: Interpreting “Access”
and “Authorization” in Computer Misuse Statutes, 78 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1596, 1640–

44 (2003). We will encounter these issues with civil law
protection as well.

b.CRIMINAL LAWS PROTECTING REAL PROPERTY

Trespass to land was not a traditional common-law crime,
unless the trespass tended to cause a breach of the peace. Only in the second
half

of the nineteenth century did criminal trespass statutes
become common. See People v. Goduto, 174 N.E.2d 385 (Ill. 1961). Some of the
early

statutes were narrow. Texas’s statute covered only hunting,
camping, or fishing on enclosed land, and was only amended in 1971 to cover

intrusions more generally, requiring notice from the owner
(or possessor acting for the owner) immediately before entry that entry is
forbidden.

(The current version is a little broader as to sources of
notice.) Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 30.05(a); see also 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. §
5/21–3(a). Still,

even under the modern statutes the penalties for criminal
trespass remain quite modest.

#338

The modesty of the penalties for criminal trespass raises
questions about the function of these laws. Such penalties cannot be regarded
as

having any significant deterrent force. (Unless perhaps the
social stigma of a misdemeanor trespass conviction is large. Is it?) How then
does a

landowner protect the right to exclude? One answer would
seem to be civil actions (like the civil trespass action at issue in Jacque v.
Steenberg

Homes in Chapter I), but these are rare. Another answer,
probably more important historically, is that landowners may use “self-help.”
In other

words, the landowner is privileged to use “reasonable force”
to expel unwanted intruders from the land—but not deadly force, at least if the

intrusion is onto land or an unoccupied building, see Katko
v. Briney, 183 N.W.2d 657 (Iowa 197 1) (spring gun cannot be used to defend

unoccupied building against trespassers). Self-help has some
obvious drawbacks—such as the possibility of violence or injury to the
landowner,

the intruder, or a bystander—which we consider in greater
detail below. This suggests that the principal function of criminal trespass
statutes is to

create an alternative to landowner self-help. The criminal
trespass statutes substitute a police officer for agents of the landowner in
enforcing the

right to exclude. The police officer is less likely than the
landowner to overreact to the situation, and less likely to encounter
resistance from the

intruder. If there is a genuine dispute between the owner
and the intruder over the right of access, it can then be
resolved—peacefully—in court.

Given the availability of the police to enforce the
landowner’s right to exclude in many situations, does this suggest that
self-help should be

prohibited as a means of enforcing the right when police
intervention is feasible? (See Berg v. Wiley , infra.)

Many criminal trespass statutes make it a crime to refuse to
leave land in possession of another only after being notified to do so. See
Tex.

Penal Code Ann. § 30.05(a). This imposes a small affirmative
burden on the landowner—to notify the intruder to leave before calling the
police.

Statutes specify in more or less detail what counts as
notice. For example, the Texas statute provides for notice by oral or written
communication;

fencing or enclosure; signs indicating that entry is
forbidden; “purple paint marks” on trees or posts that are “vertical lines of
not less than eight

inches in length and not less than one inch in width” and
subject to elaborate spacing requirements; or the presence of standing crops.
Tex. Penal

Code Ann. § 30.05(b)(2). Why put the burden on the landowner
to communicate the intent to exclude rather than put the burden on the intruder

to obtain permission to enter? Is this necessary to
establish the required scienter (mental state) on the part of the defendant
before imposing

criminal liability? What implications does the allocation of
the burden of communication have for the development of norms of
“neighborliness”

within a community? Consider also the environmental
consequences of notice requirements. These are presumably responsible (at least
in

significant part) for the proliferation of “No Trespassing,”

#339

“Private Property,” and “Do Not Enter” signs one sees on
walls, doors, and fences throughout the land. Would rural and urban landscapes
be

more attractive if the law simply imposed a duty not to
trespass on any land enclosed by a fence, wall, or other obvious border,
without requiring

explicit “notification”?

Real property is protected by criminal laws other than
criminal trespass, often with considerably more fire power. Interestingly,
however,

the heavy artillery of the criminal law, insofar as property
in land is concerned, is concentrated almost entirely on offenses that involve
buildings

or occupied structures. The crime of arson , for example, is
defined as causing a fire or explosion that destroys “a building or occupied
structure

of another.” Model Penal Code § 220.1(1). Arson is a felony
subject to very severe penalties. The crime of burglary occurs when a person
“enters

a building or structure, or separately secured or occupied
portion thereof, with purpose to commit a crime therein, unless the premises
are at the

time open to the public or the actor is licensed or
privileged to enter.” Id. § 221.1(1). Burglary is also a felony subject to
severe penalties. The

penalties for criminal trespass are also frequently more
severe if the trespass involves a building or occupied structure. Does this
overall pattern

lend support to the claim that the criminal law is
systematically more concerned with protection of persons than protection of
property, since

occupied structures by definition include persons, and
persons are more likely to be found in buildings? In any event, arson and
burglary, which

are the most severely punished crimes involving land, pose
obvious threats to the security of the person.

### 2 .CIVIL ACTIONS

Civil actions to protect and recover property have a long
and complicated history. These actions started out as common-law “writs,” which

were a kind of standardized pleading that required certain
kinds of proof and afforded certain prescribed remedies. Over time, especially
with the

adoption of the Field Codes in the mid-nineteenth century
and then the emergence of modern “notice” or “fact” pleading, the rigidities
associated

with the writs have been much relaxed. See Rodolfo Batiza,
Sources of the Field Civil Code: The Civil Law Influences on a Common Law Code,

60 Tul. L. Rev. 799 (1986).

Nevertheless, the elements associated with the individual
writs continue to live on in judicial understandings about what must be proved
in

order to establish a “cause of action.” You may have already
noticed this shift in some of the cases covered in this book. Older cases
commonly

begin with the court reciting the common-law writ that
governs the action. See, e.g., Pierson v. Post, Chapter II (“This was an action
of trespass

on the case... ”); Wetherbee v. Green, Chapter II (“This was
an action in replevin... ”); Clark v. Maloney, Chapter II (“Action of trover to

recover the value of ten white pine logs.”). More recent
cases no longer follow this format, but they often contain elaborate
discussions of

#340

whether the defendant’s behavior gives rise to a particular
cause of action. See, e.g., Moore v. Regents of the University of California,
Chapter III

(whether defendants’ taking of plaintiff’s body cells gave
rise to an action for conversion). Thus, the features of the common-law writs
live on in

the law, but in a less direct and noticeable fashion. A good
source for those seeking more detail about the common-law writs is Joseph H.
Koffler

& Alison Reppy, Common Law Pleading (1969). The
historical evolution of the writs is discussed in D.J. Ibbetson, A Historical
Introduction to

the Law of Obligations (1999).

a.CIVIL ACTIONS PROTECTING REAL PROPERTY

We start here with actions to protect real property, which
begin somewhat earlier in time than the actions that relate to personal
property. By

the thirteenth century, English courts would hear claims
based on the so-called real actions, such as the writ of novel disseisin and
the writ of

mort d’ancestor. These actions protected seisin of land, a
concept that started out meaning something like possession, but over time
became

encrusted with technicalities. See A.W.B. Simpson, A History
of the Land Law 40–41 (2d ed. 1986). By the end of the sixteenth century, the
real

actions had fallen into disuse, and had been replaced by
writs from the trespass family. Especially prominent were trespass quare
clausum fregit

(trespass “because he broke the close,” often called simply
“trespass q.c.f.”), and trespass de ejectione firmae , which became known
simply as

ejectment. Both were originally actions for money damages,
but by the sixteenth century, the common-law courts began to give specific
recovery

of land to certain parties who won an ejectment action. The
real actions never were much used in the United States, where the actions of

importance in protecting the right to land have always been
trespass and ejectment.

Trespass protects possession. Thus, a party must be in
possession of land to sue an intruder for trespass q.c.f. There was a
longstanding

debate, both in England and the United States, as to whether
ejectment was an action that protected possession or title or both. See, e.g.,
Tapscott

v. Cobbs, 52 Va. (1 1 Gratt.) 172 (1854). Whatever
ambiguities existed historically, today it is relatively clear that trespass
(the q.c.f. is usually

dropped these days) is used to vindicate the interest that a
person in possession has in exclusive possession of land, and ejectment is used
to

vindicate the interest of a person who has title to land
against a person wrongfully in possession. For example, if land is under lease,
and a

trespass such as a building encroachment occurs, the tenant
in possession is the only one who can bring an action in trespass. The landlord
would

have to sue in ejectment. See Prosser and Keeton, The Law of
Torts § 13, at 78 (5th ed. 1984).

Although the remedy for trespass was originally damages,
courts for several centuries have also awarded injunctions against trespasses.
See

discussion in Baker v. Hunt Club, infra Part C.1. Typically,
the plaintiff/

#341

possessor can recover both in a single action: damages for
injuries incurred in the past, and an injunction against recurring injury in
the future.

The plaintiff/owner suing in ejectment can also seek both
damages and an in-kind remedy: damages in the form of so-called mesne
profits—for

example the rental value of the property during the period
of wrongful possession—and a process for restoring the owner to possession.

The other civil action of importance to landowners is
nuisance. A quasi-criminal action known as the assize of nuisance existed as
early as

the thirteenth century. It was soon replaced by the action
on the case for nuisance. Nuisance originally applied to injuries that have
their source

outside the plaintiff’s land, whereas trespass q.c.f.
required a breaking of the close, and hence an injury that originated on the
land itself. Today,

nuisance is understood to protect the interest in use and
enjoyment of land, as opposed to trespass, which protects the interest in
exclusive

possession of land. Damages were the original remedy for a
nuisance, but as in the case of trespass q.c.f., injunctive relief became
available along

the way. (For more on trespass and nuisance, see Chapter
IX.)

b.CIVIL ACTIONS PROTECTING PERSONAL PROPERTY

At common law, a number of distinctive writs or rights of
action developed to protect owners of personal property. One, which dates from

the early fourteenth century and was probably quasi-criminal
in its origins, was also a member of the trespass family, in this case the writ
of

trespass de bonis asportatis (or trespass d.b.a.), which
applied to the forcible carrying off (asportation) of the plaintiff’s goods. It
was necessary

to allege that the goods had been wrongfully taken from the
plaintiff’s possession, but was not necessary to allege that they had been
converted to

the defendant’s own use. As with other early trespass
actions, an award of money damages was the only remedy available under this
writ. The

plaintiff could not recover the goods themselves.

Another common-law writ, which emerged in the early
fifteenth century and evolved out of the older action for debt, was detinue. In

contrast to trespass d.b.a., which was based on an unlawful
taking, detinue was based on the unlawful detention of goods. Detinue applied
when

the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had unjustly
detained specific goods which remained in the defendant’s possession, and which
the plaintiff

alleged should be returned to him. It was used mainly to
recover lost property and in disputes over bailments (temporary rightful
possession, see

Part D.2 below). If the defendant was found liable, he had
the option of either returning the object to the plaintiff or paying its value
in damages.

A third common-law writ that became important after the
middle of the sixteenth century was trover. This action also evolved out of the

trespass family, and in particular out of the action for
trespass on the case, which was the general action for indirect rather than
direct harms. Like

detinue, trover did not require that the plaintiff prove an
unlawful

#342

taking. Trover was used to allege that the defendant had
wrongfully converted the plaintiff’s goods to his own use, as by consuming it
or selling

it to a third party. It was not necessary to allege that the
goods remained in the defendant’s possession as under detinue, only that they
had been

converted to the defendant’s use. Damages were the only
remedy until 1854, when Parliament passed a statute authorizing the judge to
order

return of the goods in appropriate cases.

A fourth common-law writ, and the only one which provided a
mechanism for recovering the personal property itself, was replevin.

Replevin was also an old action, dating from the fourteenth
century, and it was originally used in the narrow context where a landlord
seized

personal property of the plaintiff as a distraint for unpaid
rent. Like trespass d.b.a, it was based on a wrongful taking of goods (e.g.,
because the

plaintiff claimed no rent was owed), rather than wrongful
detention. Replevin had an unusual procedure. It began with the plaintiff
posting a

bond, usually for twice the value of the property, whereupon
the plaintiff could immediately recover possession of the property. If the
plaintiff

won, the bond was returned. If the plaintiff lost, then the
bond was used to satisfy the defendant’s claim (e.g., for unpaid rent).

A fifth common-law writ, which also evolved from the
trespass family, was trespass to chattels or trespass to personal property.
This action

applied when the defendant had interfered with the
plaintiff’s possession of personal property, in some manner falling short of
conversion. This

action was invoked relatively rarely—at least until
recently, when it has been dusted off and thrust into the limelight with the
emergence of

disputes over hacking into computer systems, spamming and
other unwanted intrusions into websites and email systems. See Intel Corp. v.

Hamidi, infra.

This was the basic menu of options for protecting personal
property when the American colonies broke free of England in 1776. The newly

independent states eventually adopted laws “receiving” the
common law of England, including the writs of trespass d.b.a., detinue, trover,

replevin, and trespass to personal property. Ford W. Hall,
The Common Law: An Account of Its Reception in the United States, 4 Vand. L.
Rev.

791 (1951). But the courts would often modify the common law
to accommodate the different circumstances or needs of the fledgling nation.

Replevin was popular in America because it allowed the
plaintiff to recover possession of goods rather than simply damages. Over time,
the

action expanded well beyond its original context of
distraint for rent, and came to be used in a variety of circumstances involving
the wrongful

taking of personal property in which the plaintiff wanted to
recover possession. By a variety of fictions and legislative changes, replevin
was also

expanded to include situations involving wrongful detention,
as opposed to takings, of goods. Usually, the state courts retained some

#343

version of the original procedure calling for a posting of a
bond by the plaintiff and recovery of possession at the outset of the
litigation.

Trover became the favored action for plaintiffs seeking
relief from wrongful conversion of personal property. Under the influence of
the

Field Codes popular in the mid-nineteenth century, trover
came to be supplanted by the tort of conversion, although in substance it was
largely

the same. Today, one rarely sees reference to trover. The
principal actions for protection of personal property today are replevin,
conversion, and

trespass to personal property.

■
WERDEGAR, J. [Kourosh Kenneth Hamidi was an engineer formerly employed by the
Intel Corporation, a major producer of microchips. Intel

maintained a proprietary computer network for its employees.
This was connected to the Internet, and Intel employees were allowed to conduct

Internet searches and to send and receive messages to
persons outside the company using their email addresses, but the full list of
internal email

addresses was kept confidential. After he was fired, Hamidi
and several others formed an organization called Former and Current Employees
of

Intel (FACE-Intel). Hamidi, who served as the “webmaster”
for FACE-Intel, somehow obtained a relatively complete list of Intel’s email

addresses. Over the course of 21 months, he sent mass emails
to these addresses, reaching as many as 35,000 recipients at one time. The

messages criticized Intel’s employment practices, warned
employees of the dangers of those practices, suggested that employees consider
leaving

Intel and moving to other companies, and urged employees to
visit the FACE-Intel website for further information. The messages informed

recipients that they could be removed from FACE-Intel’s
mailing list if they so desired, and FACE-Intel honored these requests.

Intel made various efforts to block the messages from
FACE-Intel, but was only partially successful. Hamidi later admitted that he
evaded

blocking efforts by sending the messages from different
computers. Intel sent Hamidi a letter demanding that he stop, but he refused.
Intel then

sued Hamidi, alleging nuisance and trespass to chattels, and
seeking damages and injunctive relief. Intel later dropped the nuisance count
and the

request for damages. In its court filings, Intel maintained
without contradiction that significant staff time was consumed in seeking to
block

Hamidi’s messages. The FACE-Intel website, for its part,
claimed that the messages had prompted discussions between “[e]xcited and
nervous

managers” and the company’s human resources department. At
no time did Intel claim that the messages had caused any disruption or physical

damage to its computer network or its servers.]

#344

On these facts, Intel brought suit, claiming that by
communicating with its employees over the company’s e-mail system Hamidi
committed

the tort of trespass to chattels. The trial court granted
Intel’s motion for summary judgment and enjoined Hamidi from any further
mailings. A

divided Court of Appeal affirmed.

After reviewing the decisions analyzing unauthorized
electronic contact with computer systems as potential trespasses to chattels,
we

conclude that under California law the tort does not
encompass, and should not be extended to encompass, an electronic communication
that

neither damages the recipient computer system nor impairs
its functioning. Such an electronic communication does not constitute an
actionable

trespass to personal property, i.e., the computer system,
because it does not interfere with the possessor’s use or possession of, or any
other

legally protected interest in, the personal property itself.
The consequential economic damage Intel claims to have suffered, i.e., loss of

productivity caused by employees reading and reacting to
Hamidi’s messages and company efforts to block the messages, is not an injury
to the

company’s interest in its computers—which worked as intended
and were unharmed by the communications—any more than the personal

distress caused by reading an unpleasant letter would be an
injury to the recipient’s mailbox, or the loss of privacy caused by an
intrusive

telephone call would be an injury to the recipient’s
telephone equipment.

Our conclusion does not rest on any special immunity for
communications by electronic mail; we do not hold that messages transmitted

through the Internet are exempt from the ordinary rules of
tort liability. To the contrary, e-mail, like other forms of communication, may
in some

circumstances cause legally cognizable injury to the
recipient or to third parties and may be actionable under various common-law or
statutory

theories [such as interference with contractual relations,
intentional infliction of emotional distress, or publication of private facts]

---

Nor does our holding affect the legal remedies of Internet
service providers (ISP’s) against senders of unsolicited commercial bulk e-mail

(UCE), also known as “spam.” A series of federal district
court decisions, beginning with CompuServe, Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, Inc. ,
962 F.

Supp. 1015 (S.D.Ohio 1997), has approved the use of trespass
to chattels as a theory of spammers’ liability to ISP’s, based upon evidence
that

the vast quantities of mail sent by spammers both
overburdened the ISP’s own computers and made the entire computer system harder
to use for

recipients, the ISP’s customers. In those cases, discussed
in greater detail below, the underlying complaint was that the extraordinary
quantity of

UCE impaired the computer system’s functioning. In the
present case, the claimed injury is located in the disruption or distraction
caused to

recipients by the contents of the e-mail messages, an injury
entirely separate from, and not directly affecting, the possession or value of
personal

property. * * *

DISCUSSION

I.Current California Tort Law

Dubbed by Prosser the “little brother of conversion,” the
tort of trespass to chattels allows recovery for interferences with possession
of

personal property “not sufficiently important to be classed
as conversion, and so to compel the defendant to pay the full value of the
thing with

which he has interfered.” (Prosser & Keeton, Torts § 14,
pp. 85–86 (5th ed. 1984).)

Though not amounting to conversion, the defendant’s
interference must, to be actionable, have caused some injury to the chattel or
to the

plaintiff’s rights in it. Under California law, trespass to
chattels “lies where an intentional interference with the possession of
personal property

has proximately caused injury. ” (Thrifty-Tel, Inc. v.
Bezenek 54 Cal.Rptr.2d 468 (Cal. Ct. App. 1996), italics added.) * * *

The Restatement, too, makes clear that some actual injury
must have occurred in order for a trespass to chattels to be actionable. Under

section 218 of the Restatement Second of Torts,
dispossession alone, without further damages, is actionable (see id., par. (a)
& com. d, pp. 420–

421), but other forms of interference require some
additional harm to the personal property or the possessor’s interests in it.
(Id., pars. (b)–(d)).

“The interest of a possessor of a chattel in its
inviolability, unlike the similar interest of a possessor of land, is not given
legal protection by an

action for nominal damages for harmless intermeddlings with
the

#346

chattel. In order that an actor who interferes with
another’s chattel may be liable, his conduct must affect some other and more
important interest

of the possessor. Therefore, one who intentionally
intermeddles with another’s chattel is subject to liability only if his
intermeddling is harmful to

the possessor’s materially valuable interest in the physical
condition, quality, or value of the chattel, or if the possessor is deprived of
the use of

the chattel for a substantial time, or some other legally
protected interest of the possessor is affected as stated in Clause (c).
Sufficient legal

protection of the possessor’s interest in the mere
inviolability of his chattel is afforded by his privilege to use reasonable
force to protect his

possession against even harmless interference.” (Id., com.
e, pp. 421–422, italics added.) * * *

In this respect, as Prosser explains, modern day trespass to
chattels differs both from the original English writ and from the action for

trespass to land: “Another departure from the original rule
of the old writ of trespass concerns the necessity of some actual damage to the
chattel

before the action can be maintained. Where the defendant
merely interferes without doing any harm—as where, for example, he merely lays

hands upon the plaintiff’s horse, or sits in his car—there
has been a division of opinion among the writers, and a surprising dearth of
authority.

By analogy to trespass to land there might be a technical
tort in such a case..... Such scanty authority as there is, however, has
considered that

the dignitary interest in the inviolability of chattels,
unlike that as to land, is not sufficiently important to require any greater
defense than the

privilege of using reasonable force when necessary to
protect them. Accordingly it has been held that nominal damages will not be
awarded, and

that in the absence of any actual damage the action will not
lie. ” (Prosser & Keeton, Torts, supra, § 14, p. 87, italics added, fns.
omitted.) * * *

The dispositive issue in this case, therefore, is whether
the undisputed facts demonstrate Hamidi’s actions caused or threatened to cause

damage to Intel’s computer system, or injury to its rights
in that personal property, such as to entitle Intel to judgment as a matter of
law. [T]he

undisputed evidence revealed no actual or threatened damage
to Intel’s computer hardware or software and no interference with its ordinary
and

intended operation. * * *

Relying on a line of decisions, most from federal district
courts, applying the tort of trespass to chattels to various types of unwanted

electronic contact between computers, Intel contends that,
while its computers were not damaged by receiving Hamidi’s messages, its
interest in

the “physical condition, quality or value” (Rest.2d Torts, §
218, com. e, p. 422) of the computers was harmed. We disagree. The cited line
of

decisions does not persuade us that the mere sending of
electronic communications that assertedly cause injury only because of their
contents

constitutes an actionable trespass to a computer system
through which the messages are transmitted. Rather, the decisions finding

#347

electronic contact to be a trespass to computer systems have
generally involved some actual or threatened interference with the computers’

functioning. * * *

In each of these spamming cases, the plaintiff showed, or
was prepared to show, some interference with the efficient functioning of its

computer system. In CompuServe, the plaintiff ISP’s mail
equipment monitor stated that mass UCE [unsolicited commercial bulk e-mail]

mailings, especially from nonexistent addresses such as
those used by the defendant, placed “a tremendous burden” on the ISP’s
equipment,

using “disk space and drain[ing] the processing power,”
making those resources unavailable to serve subscribers. (CompuServe, supra,
962

F.Supp. at p. 1022.) Similarly, in Hotmail Corp. v. Van$
Money Pie, Inc. , 1998 WL 388389, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 16 1998), the court
found the

evidence supported a finding that the defendant’s mailings
“fill[ed] up Hotmail’s computer storage space and threaten[ed] to damage
Hotmail’s

ability to service its legitimate customers.” America
Online, Inc. v. IMS, 24 F.Supp.2d 548 (E.D. Va. 1998), decided on summary
judgment, was

deemed factually indistinguishable from CompuServe ; the
court observed that in both cases the plaintiffs “alleged that processing the
bulk e-mail

cost them time and money and burdened their equipment.” Id.
at 550. * * *

Though Hamidi sent thousands of copies of the same message
on six occasions over 21 months, that number is minuscule compared to the

amounts of mail sent by commercial operations. * * * The
functional burden on Intel’s computers, or the cost in time to individual
recipients, of

receiving Hamidi’s occasional advocacy messages cannot be
compared to the burdens and costs caused ISP’s and their customers by the ever-

rising deluge of commercial e-mail.

In addition to impairment of system functionality,
CompuServe and its progeny also refer to the ISP’s loss of business reputation
and

customer goodwill, resulting from the inconvenience and cost
that spam causes to its members, as harm to the ISP’s legally protected
interests in

its personal property. Intel argues that its own interest in
employee productivity, assertedly disrupted by Hamidi’s messages, is a
comparable

protected interest in its computer system. We disagree. * *
*

CompuServe’s customers were annoyed because the system was
inundated with unsolicited commercial messages, making its use for

personal communication more difficult and costly. Their
complaint, which allegedly led some to cancel their CompuServe service, was
about the

functioning of CompuServe’s electronic mail service. Intel’s
workers, in contrast, were allegedly distracted from their work not because of
the

frequency or quantity of Hamidi’s messages, but because of
assertions and opinions the messages conveyed. Intel’s complaint is thus about
the

contents of the messages rather than the functioning of the
company’s e-mail system. Even accepting CompuServe’ s economic injury
rationale,

therefore, Intel’s position represents a further extension
of the trespass

#348

to chattels tort, fictionally recharacterizing the allegedly
injurious effect of a communication’s contents on recipients as an impairment
to the

device which transmitted the message.

This theory of “impairment by content” (Burk, The Trouble
with Trespass, [4 J. Small & Emerging Bus.L. 27, 37 (2000)]) threatens to

stretch trespass law to cover injuries far afield from the
harms to possession the tort evolved to protect. Intel’s theory would expand
the tort of

trespass to chattels to cover virtually any unconsented-to
communication that, solely because of its content, is unwelcome to the
recipient or

intermediate transmitter. * * *

Nor may Intel appropriately assert a property interest in
its employees’ time. “The Restatement test clearly speaks in the first instance
to the

impairment of the chattel.... But employees are not chattels
(at least not in the legal sense of the term).” (Burk, The Trouble with
Trespass,

supra, 4 J. Small & Emerging Bus.L. at p. 36.) Whatever
interest Intel may have in preventing its employees from receiving disruptive

communications, it is not an interest in personal property,
and trespass to chattels is therefore not an action that will lie to protect
it. Nor, finally,

can the fact Intel staff spent time attempting to block
Hamidi’s messages be bootstrapped into an injury to Intel’s possessory interest
in its

computers. To quote * * * from the dissenting opinion in the
Court of Appeal: “[I]t is circular to premise the damage element of a tort
solely

upon the steps taken to prevent the damage. Injury can only
be established by the completed tort’s consequences, not by the cost of the
steps

taken to avoid the injury and prevent the tort; otherwise,
we can create injury for every supposed tort.”

Intel connected its e-mail system to the Internet and
permitted its employees to make use of this connection both for business and,
to a

reasonable extent, for their own purposes. In doing so, the
company necessarily contemplated the employees’ receipt of unsolicited as well
as

solicited communications from other companies and
individuals. That some communications would, because of their contents, be
unwelcome to

Intel management was virtually inevitable. Hamidi did
nothing but use the e-mail system for its intended purpose—to communicate with

employees. The system worked as designed, delivering the
messages without any physical or functional harm or disruption. These
occasional

transmissions cannot reasonably be viewed as impairing the
quality or value of Intel’s computer system. We conclude, therefore, that Intel
has

not presented undisputed facts demonstrating an injury to
its personal property, or to its legal interest in that property, that support,
under

California tort law, an action for trespass to chattels.

II.Proposed Extension of California Tort Law

We next consider whether California common law should be
extended to cover, as a trespass to chattels, an otherwise harmless electronic

communication whose contents are objectionable. * * *

#349

Writing on behalf of several industry groups appearing as
amici curiae, Professor Richard A. Epstein of the University of Chicago urges
us

to excuse the required showing of injury to personal
property in cases of unauthorized electronic contact between computers,
“extending the rules

of trespass to real property to all interactive Web sites
and servers.” The court is thus urged to recognize, for owners of a particular
species of

personal property, computer servers, the same interest in
inviolability as is generally accorded a possessor of land. In effect,
Professor Epstein

suggests that a company’s server should be its castle, upon
which any unauthorized intrusion, however harmless, is a trespass.

Epstein’s argument derives, in part, from the familiar
metaphor of the Internet as a physical space, reflected in much of the language
that

has been used to describe it: “cyberspace,” “the information
superhighway,” e-mail “addresses,” and the like. Of course, the Internet is
also

frequently called simply the “Net,” a term, Hamidi points
out, “evoking a fisherman’s chattel.” A major component of the Internet is the
World

Wide “Web,” a descriptive term suggesting neither personal
nor real property, and “cyberspace” itself has come to be known by the
oxymoronic

phrase “virtual reality,” which would suggest that any real
property “located” in “cyberspace” must be “virtually real” property. Metaphor
is a

two-edged sword.

Indeed, the metaphorical application of real property rules
would not, by itself, transform a physically harmless electronic intrusion on a

computer server into a trespass. That is because, under
California law, intangible intrusions on land, including electromagnetic
transmissions, are

not actionable as trespasses (though they may be as
nuisances) unless they cause physical damage to the real property. (San Diego
Gas & Electric

Co. v. Superior Court, 920 P.2d 669 (Cal. 1996).) Since
Intel does not claim Hamidi’s electronically transmitted messages physically
damaged its

servers, it could not prove a trespass to land even were we
to treat the computers as a type of real property. Some further extension of
the conceit

would be required, under which the electronic signals Hamidi
sent would be recast as tangible intruders, perhaps as tiny messengers rushing

through the “hallways” of Intel’s computers and bursting out
of employees’ computers to read them Hamidi’s missives. But such fictions
promise

more confusion than clarity in the law.

The plain fact is that computers, even those making up the
Internet, are—like such older communications equipment as telephones and fax

machines—personal property, not realty. Professor Epstein
observes that “[a]lthough servers may be moved in real space, they cannot be
moved

in cyberspace,” because an Internet server must, to be
useful, be accessible at a known address. But the same is true of the
telephone: to be useful

for incoming communication, the telephone must remain
constantly linked to the same number (or, when the number is changed, the
system must

include some forwarding or notification capability, a
qualification that also applies to computer addresses). Does this suggest that
an

#350

unwelcome message delivered through a telephone or fax
machine should be viewed as a trespass to a type of real property? We think
not[.] * * *

More substantively, Professor Epstein argues that a rule of
computer server inviolability will, through the formation or extension of a

market in computer-to-computer access, create “the right
social result.” In most circumstances, he predicts, companies with computers on
the

Internet will continue to authorize transmission of
information through e-mail, Web site searching, and page linking because they
benefit by that

open access. When a Web site owner does deny access to a
particular sending, searching, or linking computer, a system of “simple
one-on-one

negotiations” will arise to provide the necessary individual
licenses.

Other scholars are less optimistic about such a complete
propertization of the Internet. Professor Mark Lemley of the University of

California, Berkeley, writing on behalf of an amici curiae
group of professors of intellectual property and computer law, observes that
under a

property rule of server inviolability, “each of the hundreds
of millions of [Internet] users must get permission in advance from anyone with
whom

they want to communicate and anyone who owns a server
through which their message may travel.” The consequence for e-mail could be a

substantial reduction in the freedom of electronic
communication, as the owner of each computer through which an electronic
message passes

could impose its own limitations on message content or
source. As Professor Dan Hunter of the University of Pennsylvania asks
rhetorically:

“Does this mean that one must read the ‘Terms of Acceptable
Email Usage’ of every email system that one emails in the course of an ordinary

day? If the University of Pennsylvania had a policy that
sending a joke by email would be an unauthorized use of their system, then
under the

logic of [the lower court decision in this case], you commit
‘trespass’ if you emailed me a... cartoon.” (Hunter, Cyberspace as Place, and
the

Tragedy of the Digital Anticommons 91 Cal. L. Rev. 439,
508–509 (2003).)

Web site linking, Professor Lemley further observes, “would
exist at the sufferance of the linked-to party, because a Web user who followed

a ‘disapproved’ link would be trespassing on the plaintiff’s
server, just as sending an e-mail is trespass under the [lower] court’s
theory.” Another

writer warns that “[c]yber-trespass theory will curtail the
free flow of price and product information on the Internet by allowing website
owners

to tightly control who and what may enter and make use of
the information housed on its Internet site.” (Chang, Bidding on Trespass:
eBay, Inc.

v. Bidder’s Edge, Inc. and the Abuse of Trespass Theory in
Cyberspace Law, 29 AIPLA Q.J. 445, 459 (2001).) A leading scholar of Internet
law

and policy, Professor Lawrence Lessig of Stanford
University, has criticized Professor Epstein’s theory of the computer server as
quasi-real

property, previously put forward in the eBay case, on the
ground that it ignores the costs to society in the loss of network benefits:
“eBay benefits

greatly from a network that is open and where access is
free. It is this general feature of the Net that makes the Net so

#351

valuable to users and a source of great innovation. And to
the extent that individual sites begin to impose their own rules of exclusion,
the value

of the network as a network declines. If machines must
negotiate before entering any individual site, then the costs of using the
network climb.”

(Lessig, The Future of Ideas: The Fate of the Commons in a
Connected World (2001) p. 171; * * * )

We discuss this debate among the amici curiae and academic
writers only to note its existence and contours, not to attempt its resolution.

Creating an absolute property right to exclude undesired
communications from one’s e-mail and Web servers might help force spammers to

internalize the costs they impose on ISP’s and their
customers. But such a property rule might also create substantial new costs, to
e-mail and e-

commerce users and to society generally, in lost ease and
openness of communication and in lost network benefits. In light of the
unresolved

controversy, we would be acting rashly to adopt a rule
treating computer servers as real property for purposes of trespass law.* * *

The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed.

■
Concurring Opinion by KENNARD, J. [omitted].

■
Dissenting Opinion of BROWN, J. * * * Intel has invested millions of dollars to
develop and maintain a computer system. It did this not to act as

a public forum but to enhance the productivity of its
employees. Kourosh Kenneth Hamidi sent as many as 200,000 e-mail messages to
Intel

employees. The time required to review and delete Hamidi’s
messages diverted employees from productive tasks and undermined the utility of

the computer system. “There may... be situations in which
the value to the owner of a particular type of chattel may be impaired by
dealing

with it in a manner that does not affect its physical
condition.” (Rest.2d Torts, § 218, com. h, p. 422.) This is such a case.

The majority repeatedly asserts that Intel objected to the
hundreds of thousands of messages solely due to their content, and proposes
that

Intel seek relief by pleading content-based speech torts.
This proposal misses the point that Intel’s objection is directed not toward
Hamidi’s

message but his use of Intel’s property to display his
message. Intel has not sought to prevent Hamidi from expressing his ideas on
his Web site,

through private mail (paper or electronic) to employees’
homes, or through any other means like picketing or billboards. But as counsel
for Intel

explained during oral argument, the company objects to
Hamidi’s using Intel’s property to advance his message.

Of course, Intel deserves an injunction even if its
objections are based entirely on the e-mail’s content. Intel is entitled, for
example, to

allow employees use of the Internet to check stock market
tables or weather forecasts without incurring any concomitant obligation to
allow

access to pornographic Web sites. (Loving v. Boren 956
F.Supp. 953, 955 (W.D.Okla. 1997).) A private property owner may choose to
exclude

#352

unwanted mail for any reason, including its content. (Rowan
v. U.S. Post Office Dept. 397 U.S. 728, 738 (1970).) * * *

Regardless of whether property is real or personal, it is
beyond dispute that an individual has the right to have his personal property
free

from interference. There is some division among authorities
regarding the available remedy, particularly whether a harmless trespass
supports a

claim for nominal damages. The North Carolina Court of
Appeal has found there is no damage requirement for a trespass to chattel. (See

Hawkins v. Hawkins, 400 S.E.2d 472, 475 (N.C. 1991).) * * *
Several authorities consider a harmless trespass to goods actionable per se
only if

it is intentional. (Winfield & Jolowicz on Torts,
Trespass to Goods 403 (10th ed. 1975); Clerk & Lindsell on Torts ¶ 13–159,
p. 703 (17th ed.

1995).) The Restatement Second of Torts, section 218, which
is less inclined to favor liability, likewise forbids unauthorized use and
recognizes

the inviolability of personal property. * * * “The interest
of a possessor of a chattel in its inviolability, unlike the similar interest
of a possessor of

land, is not given legal protection by an action for nominal
damages for harmless intermeddlings with the chattel.... Sufficient legal
protection

of the possessor’s interest in the mere inviolability of his
chattel is afforded by his privilege to use reasonable force to protect his
possession

against even harmless interference. ” (Rest.2d Torts, § 218,
com. e, pp. 421–422, italics added.) Accordingly, the protection of land and
chattels

may differ on the question of nominal damages unrelated to
actual injury. The authorities agree, however, that (1) the chattel is
inviolable, (2) the

trespassee need not tolerate even harmless interference, and
(3) the possessor may use reasonable force to prevent it. Both California law
and the

Restatement authorize reasonable force regardless of whether
the property in question is real or personal. (Civ.Code, § 51; Rest.2d Torts, §
77.)

---

In 1996, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme
Court considered the claim of plaintiff Tillman, who sought to enjoin the

unwanted delivery of a newspaper onto his property. (Tillman
v. Distribution Systems of America Inc., 224 A.D.2d 79, 648 N.Y.S.2d 630

(1996).) He offered no specific critique of the newspaper’s
content, observing only “ ‘[t]here is no reason that we have to clean up
[defendant’s]

mess.’ ” (Id. at p. 632 .) * * * [T]he court rejected the
defendants’ argument “that there is nothing a homeowner can do to stop the
dumping on his

or her property of pamphlets or newspapers, no matter how
offensive they might be,” and instead upheld Tillman’s right to prevent the
mail’s

delivery, regardless of whether his objection was due to the
quantity (volume) or quality (content) of the messages. (Tillman, at p. 636.)
In

authorizing injunctive relief, the Tillman court found no
need to quantify the actual damage created by the delivery; it merely noted
that the

homeowner should not be forced either “to allow such
unwanted newspapers to accumulate, or to expend the time and

#353

energy necessary to gather and to dispose of them.” (Ibid.)
Subsequent courts have extended this policy to the delivery of e-mail as well.

Hamidi concedes Intel’s legal entitlement to block the
unwanted messages. The problem is that although Intel has resorted to the
cyberspace

version of reasonable force, it has so far been unsuccessful
in determining how to resist the unwanted use of its system. Thus, while Intel
has the

legal right to exclude Hamidi from its system, it does not
have the physical ability. It may forbid Hamidi’s use, but it can not prevent
it.

To the majority, Hamidi’s ability to outwit Intel’s cyber
defenses justifies denial of Intel’s claim to exclusive use of its property.
Under this

reasoning, it is not right but might that determines the
extent of a party’s possessory interest. Although the world often works this
way, the legal

system should not. * * *

Those who have contempt for grubby commerce and reverence
for the rarified heights of intellectual discourse may applaud today’s

decision, but even the flow of ideas will be curtailed if
the right to exclude is denied. As the Napster controversy revealed, creative
individuals

will be less inclined to develop intellectual property if
they cannot limit the terms of its transmission. Similarly, if online
newspapers cannot

charge for access, they will be unable to pay the
journalists and editorialists who generate ideas for public consumption. * * *

The principles of both personal liberty and social utility
should counsel us to usher the common law of property into the digital age.

■
Dissenting Opinion by MOSK, J. * * * * The majority fail to distinguish open
communication in the public “commons” of the Internet from

unauthorized intermeddling on a private, proprietary
intranet. Hamidi is not communicating in the equivalent of a town square or of
an

unsolicited “junk” mailing through the United States Postal
Service. His action, in crossing from the public Internet into a private
intranet, is

more like intruding into a private office mailroom,
commandeering the mail cart, and dropping off unwanted broadsides on 30,000
desks.

Because Intel’s security measures have been circumvented by
Hamidi, the majority leave Intel, which has exercised all reasonable self-help

efforts, with no recourse unless he causes a malfunction or
systems “crash.” Hamidi’s repeated intrusions did more than merely “prompt[ ]

discussions between ‘[e]xcited and nervous managers’ and the
company’s human resource department” (maj. opn., ante); they also constituted a

misappropriation of Intel’s private computer system contrary
to its intended use and against Intel’s wishes.

The law of trespass to chattels has not universally been
limited to physical damage. I believe it is entirely consistent to apply that
legal

theory to these circumstances—that is, when a proprietary
computer

#354

system is being used contrary to its owner’s purposes and
expressed desires, and self-help has been ineffective. Intel correctly expects
protection

from an intruder who misuses its proprietary system, its
nonpublic directories, and its supposedly controlled connection to the Internet
to achieve

his bulk mailing objectives—incidentally, without even
having to pay postage. * * *

Here, Hamidi’s deliberate and continued intermeddling, and
threatened intermeddling, with Intel’s proprietary computer system for his own

purposes that were hostile to Intel, certainly impaired the
quality and value of the system as an internal business device for Intel and
forced Intel

to incur costs to try to maintain the security and integrity
of its server—efforts that proved ineffective. These included costs incurred to
mitigate

injuries that had already occurred. It is not a matter of
“bootstrapp[ing]” (maj. opn., ante) to consider those costs a damage to Intel.
Indeed, part

of the value of the proprietary computer system is the
ability to exclude intermeddlers from entering it for significant uses that are
disruptive to

its owner’s business operations. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Recall that in _Jacque v. Steenberg Homes_ , the
Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld a $ 100 , 000 punitive damages award to a couple
for a trespass to

land that did no injury to the land or any other tangible
interest of the owners. Yet according to the majority in _Hamidi_ , there is no
legal remedy other

than self-help for an intentional trespass to personal
property that does no physical injury to the property. This means, for example,
that if someone

repeatedly sits in your car without your permission, and
does no damage to it, you have no civil remedy, either for an injunction or
damages. Does this

strike you as sound? What is the justification for requiring
actual injury to establish trespass to personal property but not requiring this
to show trespass

to land? You may want to reconsider the issue after
considering the next set of materials, on self-help.

2 .Another way to view _Hamidi_ is that it simply limits the
available remedies for trespass to personal property to damages, which after
all is the

general remedy in tort, including for other torts in the
trespass family. If the only remedy is damages, then typically one gets no
relief unless one can

prove actual damages. The unusual thing about trespass to
personal property, from this perspective, is that equity will not intervene to
issue an injunction

in cases of repeated or vexatious invasions of personal
property. Compare with Baker v. Howard County Hunt Club, infra Part C. 1. What
might be the

justification for cutting off equitable relief in this
context? See Keith N. Hylton, Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Immunity: An
Application to

Cyberspace, 87 B.U. L. Rev. 1 , 16 – 23 ( 2007 ).

3 .The majority and dissenting opinions disagree as to
whether Intel Corporation has shown that it suffered actual injury because of
the unwanted

mass emails from Hamidi. Does the majority’s conclusion of
no injury rest on a presumption that injury based on the content of a

```



355



```

communication cannot count as injury, at least for trespass
purposes? Do the dissents’ contrary conclusions rest on a presumption that
injury is always

present when a proprietor must take measures to exclude an
intruder? Which presumption is more appropriate?

4 .Given that Hamidi’s invasion of Intel’s computer network
took the form of electrons, why was trespass to personal property the correct
cause of

action? If real property were the interest at stake,
wouldn’t an invasion by electrons be governed by nuisance rather than trespass?
(See Chapters I and

IX.) Why is there no analogue to nuisance among the actions
that protect personal property? Should there be? Should nuisance law be
extended to cover

intangible invasions into “virtual” space, such as an
intranet? See Adam Mossoff, Spam—Oy, What a Nuisance!, 19 Berkeley Tech. L.J.
625 ( 2004 ).

5 .Even if one can establish that someone is causing actual
harm to an intranet system (or other electronic network), how does one
establish a

“trespassory invasion” in this context? With physical
property, a trespass occurs when the boundary of real property is crossed or
when someone touches

an item of personal property. But is every form of
“unauthorized access” into an electronic network necessarily a trespass?

6 .The most far-reaching issue discussed in _Hamidi_ reverts
to the question of whether “cyberspace” should be subject to parcelization,
with

individually-developed segments like intranets and web-sites
protected by property-like exclusion rights, or whether it should be regarded
as an open-

access resource, like navigable waterways and public
highways. The debate between the amici curiae summarized by the majority in
Part II of its

opinion, “Proposed Extension of California Tort Law,” poses
the question in terms of transaction costs. Richard Epstein argued that
parcelization would

produce efficient outcomes, because owners of computers
linked to the Internet would grant blanket consent to “visitations” by
outsiders, and would

single out for exclusion only those who are unwanted. Mark
Lemley and Larry Lessig argued that parcelization would require some kind of
individually

negotiated license between the proprietor of the computer
network and each outside “visitor,” and that these negotiations would unduly
burden the flow

of information and possibly create a cyber-anticommons. (On
the anticommons, see Chapter II.) Who has the better argument? Are spam filters

generally an effective device for eliminating unwanted
electronic messages?

7 .More disgruntled employees: In _School of Visual Arts v.
Kuprewicz_ , 771 N.Y.S. 2 d 804 (N.Y. Sup. 2003 ), the defendant, a former
employee at the

School of Visual Arts, posted false job advertisements on
Craigslist.com for the job held by SVA’s Director of Human Resources, and
registered her

email address on several pornographic websites, causing her
to receive “large volumes” of both applications for her job and pornographic
emails. On a

motion to dismiss, the court found that the many-headed
complaint only stated a cause of action in trespass to personal property.
Asserting its agreement

with _Hamidi_ , the court declared that its decision to
sustain the complaint was based on the allegations of physical detriment to the
computer system from

the volume of mail, not on the intrusive and unwanted
character

```



356



```

of the emails. What if the case had involved a smaller
volume of emails (or a less vulnerable computer) than was alleged, but the
emails were just as

disturbing? What if, further, the plaintiff had told the
defendant to stop, but the plaintiff refused? Should it matter if self-help had
been tried and failed,

as in _Hamidi_? See, e.g., Patricia L. Bellia, Defending
Cyberproperty, 79 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 2164 ( 2004 ); William Hubbard, Communicating
Entitlements:

Property and the Internet, 22 Yale L. & Pol’y Rev. 401 (
2004 ); Symposium, Property Rights on the Frontier: The Economics and Self-Help
and Self-

Defense in Cyberspace, 1 J.L. Econ. & Pol’y 1 ( 2005 ).

8 .Like many other issues we canvass in this book, the
debate between the majority and the dissents is at least in part a debate about
the choice of

the appropriate institution to resolve an issue. The
majority believes that trespass to personal property should be defined narrowly
in the context of

cyber-invasions, leaving more aggressive regulation up to
the legislature. The dissents argue that the courts should step in and provide
a remedy based

on analogical extension of the common law, leaving it to the
legislature to make revisions if necessary. Which approach do you think
generally better for

adjusting the law to inevitable technological and social
changes?

9 .Civil protections of personal property may or may not
extend to intangibles. Courts take a wide variety of approaches to whether
intangibles

(power, wifi-signals, data, assets in online games) can be
converted. For an expansive approach to liability, see _Kremen v. Cohen_ , 337
F. 3 d 1024 , 1030

( 9 th Cir. 2003 ), a decision applying California law in
the same year as _Intel v. Hamidi_. Can such assets be possessed? Does that
matter? Might such

conversion liability vastly expand intellectual property by
the back door? See, e.g., João Marinotti, Tangibility as Technology, 37 Ga. St.
L. Rev. 671

( 2021 ).

### 3 .SELF-HELP

In addition to formal legal remedies provided by criminal
and civil law, property owners are entitled to take a variety of steps to
protect or

enforce their property rights without the direct involvement
of the legal system. These measures, which we collectively call “self-help,”
may in

fact be more important in preserving the general structure
of ownership than formal legal remedies; certainly they are utilized far more
often. The

use of self-help in defending present possession is
particularly ubiquitous. Fences, locks on doors, security guards, dogs, burglar
alarms, and

video cameras are all familiar examples of self-help in the
real property context. Ignition locks, safes, indelible serial numbers, and
Lojack

tracking systems are examples in the personal property
realm.

The nature of self-help as a mode of protection for property
can be illuminated by considering a distinction introduced by Wesley Newcomb

Hohfeld between “rights” and “privileges.” See generally
Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld, Some Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in

Judicial Reasoning, 23 Yale L.J. 16 (1913), reprinted in
Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld, Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial

Reasoning and Other Legal Essays, 23–64 (Walter Wheeler Cook
ed.,

#357

Yale Univ. Press 1923). A “right” as Hohfeld defined the
term, is a claim that one person has against one or more others, which
corresponds to a

duty that these others have toward the one with the right.
Thus, if A owns Blackacre, A has a right to exclude B, C, D, etc. from
Blackacre, and

B, C, D, etc., have a corresponding duty to keep off
Blackacre without A’s permission. A “privilege,” as Hohfeld used the term, is a
freedom to

act in certain ways without interference from others, which
corresponds to a “no-right” in the others to interfere with the one exercising
the

privilege. Self-help can be thought of as a type of
privilege associated with ownership. If A owns Blackacre, then A has a
privilege to engage in a

variety of defensive measures to protect Blackacre from
invasions or other harms by others, such as B, C, D, etc. The others, B, C, D,
etc. have

“no-right” to interfere or try to stop A from deploying
these defensive measures. Note that a privilege permits but does not compel a
person to do

certain things. Thus, an owner is permitted to use self-help
to protect her interest in possession, but is not required to do so. For
example, an

owner of an automobile is permitted to lock the doors to
discourage theft or joyriding, but if the owner neglects to lock the doors, the
owner still

has the right, in the Hohfeldian sense, to demand that
others not steal the car or engage in joyriding.

Self-help becomes controversial when it involves the use of
force, as opposed to passive devices like fences and locks. A person in

possession of property can generally use reasonable force
when the person “believes that such force is immediately necessary... to
prevent or

terminate an unlawful entry or other trespass upon land or a
trespass against or the unlawful carrying away of tangible, movable property.”

Model Penal Code § 3.06(1)(a). The Model Penal Code takes
the position that in the case of burglary, reasonable force does not mean
deadly

force, unless there is a danger to persons. Id. §
3.06(3)(d). But many jurisdictions disagree, and permit the use of deadly force
to avert burglary,

whether or not there is proof of a specific threat to
persons. See N.Y. Penal Law § 35.20(3).

Even more controversial is the use of self-help to recover
possession of property once it has been transferred to another. As the
following

cases suggest, the current state of the law here diverges
between real and personal property.

Supreme Court of Minnesota, 1978.



264 N.W. 2 d 145.

■
ROGOSHESKE, JUSTICE. Defendant landlord, Wiley Enterprises, Inc., and defendant
Rodney A. Wiley (hereafter collectively referred to as Wiley)

appeal from a judgment upon a jury verdict awarding
plaintiff tenant, A Family Affair Restaurant, Inc., damages for wrongful
eviction from its

leased premises. The issues for review are whether the
evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s finding that the tenant did not
abandon or

surrender the premises and whether the trial court erred in

#358

finding Wiley’s reentry forcible and wrongful as a matter of
law. We hold that the jury’s verdict is supported by sufficient evidence and
that the

trial court’s determination of unlawful entry was correct as
a matter of law, and affirm the judgment.

On November 1 1, 1970 , Wiley, as lessor and tenant’s
predecessor in interest as lessee, executed a written lease agreement letting
land and a

building in Osseo, Minnesota, for use as a restaurant. The
lease provided a 5-year term beginning December 1, 1970, and specified that the
tenant

agreed to bear all costs of repairs and remodeling, to “make
no changes in the building structure” without prior written authorization from
Wiley,

and to “operate the restaurant in a lawful and prudent
manner.” Wiley also reserved the right “at (his) option (to) retake possession”
of the

premises “(s)hould the Lessee fail to meet the conditions of
this Lease.”^1 In early 1971, plaintiff Kathleen Berg took assignment of the
lease from

the prior lessee, and on May 1, 1971, she opened “A Family
Affair Restaurant” on the premises. In January 1973, Berg incorporated the

restaurant and assigned her interest in the lease to “A
Family Affair Restaurant, Inc.” As sole shareholder of the corporation, she
alone continued

to act for the tenant.

The present dispute has arisen out of Wiley’s objection to
Berg’s continued remodeling of the restaurant without procuring written

permission and her consequent operation of the restaurant in
a state of disrepair with alleged health code violations. Strained relations
between

the parties came to a head in June and July 19 73. In a
letter dated June 29, 1973, Wiley’s attorney charged Berg with having breached
lease items

5 and 6 by making changes in the building structure without
written authorization and by operating an unclean kitchen in violation of
health

regulations. The letter demanded that a list of eight
remodeling items be completed within 2 weeks from the date of the letter, by
Friday, July 13,

1973, or Wiley would retake possession of the premises under
lease item 7. Also, a June 13 inspection of the restaurant by the Minnesota

Department of Health had produced an order that certain
listed changes be completed within specified time limits in order to comply
with the

health code. The major items on the inspector’s list,
similar to those listed by Wiley’s attorney, were to be completed by July 15,
1973.

#359

During the 2-week deadline set by both Wiley and the health
department, Berg continued to operate the restaurant without closing to

complete the required items of remodeling. The evidence is
in dispute as to whether she intended to permanently close the restaurant and
vacate

the premises at the end of the 2 weeks or simply close for
about 1 month in order to remodel to comply with the health code. At the close
of

business on Friday, July 13, 1973, the last day of the
2-week period, Berg dismissed her employees, closed the restaurant, and placed
a sign in the

window saying “Closed for Remodeling.” Earlier that day,
Berg testified, Wiley came to the premises in her absence and attempted to
change the

locks. When she returned and asserted her right to continue
in possession, he complied with her request to leave the locks unchanged. Berg
also

testified that at about 9:30 p. m. that evening, while she
and four of her friends were in the restaurant, she observed Wiley hanging from
the

awning peering into the window. Shortly thereafter, she
heard Wiley pounding on the back door demanding admittance. Berg called the
county

sheriff to come and preserve order. Wiley testified that he
observed Berg and a group of her friends in the restaurant removing paneling
from a

wall. Allegedly fearing destruction of his property, Wiley
called the city police, who, with the sheriff, mediated an agreement between
the parties

to preserve the status quo until each could consult with
legal counsel on Monday, July 16, 1973.

Wiley testified that his then attorney advised him to take
possession of the premises and lock the tenant out. Accompanied by a police

officer and a locksmith, Wiley entered the premises in
Berg’s absence and without her knowledge on Monday, July 16, 1973, and changed
the

locks. Later in the day, Berg found herself locked out. The
lease term was not due to expire until December 1, 1975. The premises were
re-let to

another tenant on or about August 1, 1973. Berg brought this
damage action against Wiley and three other named defendants, including the new

tenant, on July 27, 1973.^2 * * *

The jury * * * awarded Berg $31,000 for lost profits and
$3,540 for loss of chattels resulting from the wrongful lockout. The jury also

specifically found that Berg neither abandoned nor
surrendered the premises. * * *

The first issue before us concerns the sufficiency of
evidence to support the jury’s finding that Berg had not abandoned or
surrendered the

leasehold before being locked out by Wiley. Viewing the
evidence to support the jury’s special verdict in the light most favorable to
Berg, as we

must, we hold it amply supports the jury’s finding of no
abandonment

#360

or surrender of the premises. While the evidence bearing
upon Berg’s intent was strongly contradictory, the jury could reasonably have

concluded, based on Berg’s testimony and supporting
circumstantial evidence, that she intended to retain possession, closing
temporarily to

remodel. Thus, the lockout cannot be excused on ground that
Berg abandoned or surrendered the leasehold.

The second and more difficult issue is whether Wiley’s
self-help repossession of the premises by locking out Berg was correctly held

wrongful as a matter of law.

Minnesota has historically followed the common-law rule that
a landlord may rightfully use self-help to retake leased premises from a

tenant in possession without incurring liability for
wrongful eviction provided two conditions are met: (1) The landlord is legally
entitled to

possession, such as where a tenant holds over after the
lease term or where a tenant breaches a lease containing a reentry clause; and
(2) the

landlord’s means of reentry are peaceable. Mercil v.
Broulette, 69 N.W. 218 (Minn. 1896). Under the common-law rule, a tenant who is
evicted

by his landlord may recover damages for wrongful eviction
where the landlord either had no right to possession or where the means used to

remove the tenant were forcible, or both. See, e.g., Poppen
v. Wadleigh, 51 N.W.2d 75 (Minn. 1952); Sweeney v. Meyers, 270 N.W. 906 (Minn.

1937); Lobdell v. Keene, 88 N.W. 426 (Minn. 1901). See,
also, Minn.St. 566.01 (statutory cause of action where entry is not “allowed by
law” or,

if allowed, is not made “in a peaceable manner”).

Wiley contends that Berg had breached the provisions of the
lease, thereby entitling Wiley, under the terms of the lease, to retake

possession, and that his repossession by changing the locks
in Berg’s absence was accomplished in a peaceful manner. * * * Whether Berg had
in

fact breached the lease and whether Wiley was hence entitled
to possession was not judicially determined. That issue became irrelevant upon
the

trial court’s finding that Wiley’s reentry was forcible as a
matter of law because even if Berg had breached the lease, this could not
excuse

Wiley’s nonpeaceable reentry. The finding that Wiley’s
reentry was forcible as a matter of law provided a sufficient ground for
damages, and the

issue of breach was not submitted to the jury. * * *

It has long been the policy of our law to discourage
landlords from taking the law into their own hands, and our decisions and
statutory law

have looked with disfavor upon any use of self-help to
dispossess a tenant in circumstances which are likely to result in breaches of
the peace.

We gave early recognition to this policy in Lobdell v. Keene
, 88 N.W. 426, 430 (Minn. 1901), where we said:

The object and purpose of the legislature in the enactment
of the forcible entry and unlawful detainer statute was to prevent those

claiming a right of entry or possession of lands from
redressing their own wrongs by entering into possession in a violent and
forcible

manner. All such acts tend to a breach of the

#361

peace, and encourage high-handed oppression. The law does
not permit the owner of land, be his title ever so good, to be the judge of

his own rights with respect to a possession adversely held,
but puts him to his remedy under the statutes.

To facilitate a resort to judicial process, the legislature
has provided a summary procedure in Minn.St. 566.02 to 566 .17 whereby a
landlord may

recover possession of leased premises upon proper notice and
showing in court in as little as 3 to 10 days. As we recognized in Mutual Trust
Life

Ins. Co. v. Berg , 246 N.W. 9, 10 (Minn. 1932), “(t)he
forcible entry and unlawful detainer statutes were intended to prevent parties
from taking

the law into their own hands when going into possession of
lands and tenements * * * .” To further discourage self-help, our legislature
has

provided treble damages for forcible evictions, §§ 557.08
and 557.09, and has provided additional criminal penalties for intentional and
unlawful

exclusion of a tenant. § 504.25. In Sweeney v. Meyers ,
supra, we allowed a business tenant not only damages for lost profits but also
punitive

damages against a landlord who, like Wiley, entered in the
tenant’s absence and locked the tenant out.

In the present case, as in Sweeney , the tenant was in
possession, claiming a right to continue in possession adverse to the
landlord’s claim of

breach of the lease, and had neither abandoned nor
surrendered the premises. Wiley, well aware that Berg was asserting her right
to possession,

retook possession in her absence by picking the locks and
locking her out. The record shows a history of vigorous dispute and keen
animosity

between the parties. Upon this record, we can only conclude
that the singular reason why actual violence did not erupt at the moment of
Wiley’s

changing of the locks was Berg’s absence and her subsequent
self-restraint and resort to judicial process. Upon these facts, we cannot find

Wiley’s means of reentry peaceable under the common-law
rule. Our long-standing policy to discourage self-help which tends to cause a
breach

of the peace compels us to disapprove the means used to
dispossess Berg. To approve this lockout, as urged by Wiley, merely because in
Berg’s

absence no actual violence erupted while the locks were
being changed, would be to encourage all future tenants, in order to protect
their

possession, to be vigilant and thereby set the stage for the
very kind of public disturbance which it must be our policy to discourage. * *
*

We recognize that the growing modern trend departs
completely from the common-law rule to hold that self-help is never available
to

dispossess a tenant who is in possession and has not
abandoned or voluntarily surrendered the premises. Annotation, 6 A.L.R.3d 177,
186; 76

Dickinson L.Rev. 215, 227. This growing rule is founded on
the recognition that the potential for violent breach of peace inheres in any
situation

where a landlord attempts by his own means to remove a
tenant who is claiming possession adversely to the landlord. Courts adopting
the rule

reason that there is no cause to sanction such potentially
disruptive self-help where adequate and speedy means are provided for removing
a

#362

tenant peacefully through judicial process. At least 16
states^6 have adopted this modern rule, holding that judicial proceedings,
including the

summary procedures provided in those states’ unlawful
detainer statutes, are the exclusive remedy by which a landlord may remove a
tenant

claiming possession.

While we would be compelled to disapprove the lockout of
Berg in her absence under the common-law rule as stated, we approve the trial

court’s reasoning and adopt as preferable the modern view
represented by the cited cases. To make clear our departure from the common-law
rule

for the benefit of future landlords and tenants, we hold
that, subsequent to our decision in this case, the only lawful means to
dispossess a tenant

who has not abandoned nor voluntarily surrendered but who
claims possession adversely to a landlord’s claim of breach of a written lease
is by

resort to judicial process. We find that Minn.St. 56 6.02 to
566.17 provide the landlord with an adequate remedy for regaining possession in
every

such case.^8 Where speedier action than provided in §§
566.02 to 566.17 seems necessary because of threatened destruction of the
property or

other exigent circumstances, a temporary restraining order
under Rule 65, Rules of Civil Procedure, and law enforcement protection are
available

to the landlord. Considered together, these statutory and
judicial remedies provide a complete answer to the landlord. In our modern
society, with

the availability of prompt and sufficient legal remedies as
described, there is no place and no need for self-help against a tenant in
claimed lawful

possession of leased premises.

Applying our holding to the facts of this case, we conclude,
as did the trial court, that because Wiley failed to resort to judicial
remedies

against Berg’s holding possession adversely to Wiley’s claim
of breach of the lease, his lockout of Berg was wrongful as a matter of law.
The rule

we adopt in this decision is fairly applied against Wiley,
for it is clear that, applying the older common-law rule to the facts and
circumstances

peculiar to this case, we would be compelled to find the
lockout nonpeaceable for the reasons previously stated. The jury found that the
lockout

caused Berg damage and, as between Berg and Wiley, equity
dictates that Wiley, who himself performed the act causing the damage, must
bear

the loss.

Affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Forcible entry and detainer (FED) statutes are used most
often in landlord-tenant disputes. The most common type of action, as in the
principal

case, is one brought by the landlord seeking to regain
possession of leased premises from a tenant. In order to bring such an action,
the landlord must

show that he or she has the right to possession of the
premises, which in turn typically requires that the lease contain a clause
providing that the tenant

forfeits the right of possession or that the landlord has
the right to reenter and retake possession upon the happening of certain events
(such as

nonpayment of rent or holding over after a lease has
expired). Can you identify such a clause in the lease in this case? In some
states (though not

Minnesota), FED statutes can also be invoked by tenants,
provided that the tenant wants to be restored to possession following an
allegedly wrongful

ouster by the landlord. See, e.g., Lees v. Wardall, 554 P. 2
d 1076 (Wash. Ct. App. 1976 ). Litigated disputes involving FED statutes also
arise in the

context of land sale contracts, for example where a seller
refuses to turn over possession to a purchaser or where a purchaser enters into
possession

without having fulfilled all the requirements of the
contract. FED statutes are also available in the event that someone with a
legal right to possession is

forcibly dispossessed by someone without such a right, e.g.,
a squatter. See generally William Lindsley, Forcible Entry and Detainer, 35 A
Am. Jur. 2 d

§ 7 ( 2005 ). Reported opinions involving the use of FED
statutes in such situations are very rare, however. Either these sorts of
depredations do not occur

very often, or if they do, they are resolved by the police
or by criminal trespass charges rather than by civil litigation.

2 .Suppose Berg closed the restaurant, put out a sign that
said “Closed for Remodeling,” disappeared, and failed to pay the rent when it
was due at

the beginning of the next month. Would Wiley be obliged to
file an FED action to regain possession of the premises in these circumstances?
If your

answer is yes, what if two months have gone by with no Berg
and no rent? Is the holding of _Berg v. Wiley_ limited to cases where the
tenant is still in

possession? If so, how do we define “possession” in such
situations?

3. _Berg v. Wiley_ may have reflected the “growing modern
   trend” when it was decided in 1978 , but it is by no means the unanimous view
   today.

Other courts have more recently held that, at least in the
context of commercial landlord-tenant disputes, self-help is still permitted.
See, e.g., Northfield

Park Associates v. Northeast Ohio Harness, 521 N.E. 2 d 466
(Ohio Ct. App. 1987 ); 2 Milton R. Friedman, Friedman on Leases § 18. 6
(Patrick A.

Randolph, Jr. ed. & rev., 5 th ed. 2005 ). What factors
are relevant in deciding whether self-help should be prohibited as a matter of
law? For example,

would it be relevant if there is a severe backlog of cases
in landlord-tenant court or if the sheriff’s department is so understaffed that
it takes an average

of three months to carry out an eviction order?

4 .In jurisdictions that still permit self-help, recovery of
possession must be accomplished without a breach of the peace. Both the trial
court and

the state supreme court in _Berg v. Wiley_ held that Wiley’s
actions were not peaceable. What should Wiley have done differently in order to
satisfy the

```



364



```

requirement that there be no breach of the peace? Presumably
politely asking the party in possession to leave is okay. What about asking the
party to

leave on threat of litigation? What about demanding that the
party leave or else the landlord will cut off utilities or other services?
Provided the landlord

takes care to ensure that the tenant is not at the premises,
what is wrong with changing the locks in the presence of a police officer?
Given that Wiley

changed the locks in the presence of a police officer, is it
plausible to say, as the court does, that “the singular reason why actual
violence did not erupt at

the moment of Wiley’s changing of the locks was Berg’s
absence and her subsequent self-restraint and resort to judicial process”?

#### Williams v. Ford Motor Credit Company

```



United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit, 1982.



674 F. 2 d 717.



```

■
BENSON, CHIEF JUDGE. In this diversity action brought by Cathy A. Williams to
recover damages for conversion arising out of an alleged

wrongful repossession of an automobile, Williams appeals
from a judgment notwithstanding the verdict entered on motion of defendant Ford

Motor Credit Company (FMCC). * * *

In July, 1975, David Williams, husband of plaintiff Cathy
Williams, purchased a Ford Mustang from an Oklahoma Ford dealer. Although

David Williams executed the sales contract, security
agreement, and loan papers, title to the car was in the name of both David and
Cathy

Williams. The car was financed through the Ford dealer, who
in turn assigned the paper to FMCC. Cathy and David Williams were divorced in

1977. The divorce court granted Cathy title to the
      automobile and required David to continue to make payments to FMCC for eighteen
      months.

David defaulted on the payments and signed a voluntary
repossession authorization for FMCC. Cathy Williams was informed of the
delinquency

and responded that she was trying to get her former husband
David to make the payments. There is no evidence of any agreement between her

and FMCC. Pursuant to an agreement with FMCC, S & S was
directed to repossess the automobile.

On December 1, 1977, at approximately 4:30 a. m., Cathy
Williams was awakened by a noise outside her house trailer in Van Buren,

Arkansas.^2 She saw that a wrecker truck with two men in it
had hooked up to the Ford Mustang and started to tow it away. She went outside
and

hollered at them. The truck stopped. She then told them that
the car was hers and asked them what they were doing. One of the men, later

identified as Don Sappington, president of S & S
Recovery, Inc., informed her that he was repossessing the vehicle on behalf of
FMCC. Williams

explained that she had been attempting to bring the past due
payments up to date and informed Sappington that the car contained personal
items

which did not even belong to her. Sappington got out of the
truck,

#365

retrieved the items from the car, and handed them to her.
Without further complaint from Williams, Sappington returned to the truck and
drove

off, car in tow. At trial, Williams testified that
Sappington was polite throughout their encounter and did not make any threats
toward her or do

anything which caused her to fear any physical harm. The
automobile had been parked in an unenclosed driveway which plaintiff shared
with a

neighbor. The neighbor was awakened by the wrecker backing
into the driveway, but did not come out. After the wrecker drove off, Williams

returned to her house trailer and called the police,
reporting her car as stolen. Later, Williams commenced this action.

The case was tried to a jury which awarded her $5,000.00 in
damages. * * * The district court entered judgment notwithstanding the verdict

for FMCC, and this appeal followed.

Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which
Arkansas has adopted and codified as Ark.Stat.Ann. § 85–9–503 (Supp. 1981),

provides in pertinent part:

Unless otherwise agreed, a secured party has on default the
right to take possession of the collateral. In taking possession, a secured

party may proceed without judicial process if this can be
done without breach of the peace....^4

In Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Herring , 589 S.W.2d 584, 586
(Ark. 1979), which involved an alleged conversion arising out of a
repossession,

the Supreme Court of Arkansas cited Section 85–9–503 and
referred to its previous holdings as follows:

In pre-code cases, we have sustained a finding of conversion
only where force, or threats of force, or risk of invoking violence,

accompanied the repossession. Manhattan Credit Co., Inc. v.
Brewer, 341 S.W.2d 765 (Ark. 1961); Kensinger Acceptance Corp. v.

Davis, 269 S.W.2d 792 (Ark. 1954).

The thrust of Williams’ argument on appeal is that the
repossession was accomplished by the risk of invoking violence. The district
judge

who presided at the trial commented on her theory in his
memorandum opinion:

Mrs. Williams herself admitted that the men who repossessed
her automobile were very polite and complied with her requests. The

evidence does not reveal that they performed any act which
was oppressive, threatening or tended to cause physical violence. Unlike

the situation presented in Manhattan Credit Co. v. Brewer ,
supra, it was not shown that Mrs. Williams would

#366

have been forced to resort to physical violence to stop the
men from leaving with her automobile.

In the pre-Code case Manhattan Credit Co. v. Brewer , 341
S.W.2d 765 (Ark. 1961), the court held that a breach of peace occurred when the

debtor and her husband confronted the creditor’s agent
during the act of repossession and clearly objected to the repossession, 341
S.W.2d at

767–68. In Manhattan , the court examined holdings of
earlier cases in which repossessions were deemed to have been accomplished
without any

breach of the peace, id. In particular, the Supreme Court of
Arkansas discussed the case of Rutledge v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp. , 237
S.W.2d

469 (Ark. 1951). In Rutledge , the court found no breach of
the peace when the repossessor acquired keys to the automobile, confronted the

debtor and his wife, informed them he was going to take the
car, and immediately proceeded to do so. As the Rutledge court explained and
the

Manhattan court reiterated, a breach of the peace did not
occur when the “Appellant (debtor-possessor) did not give his permission but he
did not

object.” Manhattan, supra, 341 S.W.2d at 767–68; Rutledge,
supra, 237 S.W.2d at 470.

We have read the transcript of the trial. There is no
material dispute in the evidence, and the district court has correctly
summarized it.

Cathy Williams did not raise an objection to the taking, and
the repossession was accomplished without any incident which might tend to

provoke violence. See also Teeter Motor Co., Inc. v. First
Nat’l Bank, 543 S.W.2d 938 (Ark. 1976).

Appellees deserve something less than commendation for the
taking during the night time sleeping hours, but it is clear that viewing the

facts in the light most favorable to Williams, the taking
was a legal repossession under the laws of the State of Arkansas. The evidence
does not

support the verdict of the jury. FMCC is entitled to
judgment notwithstanding the verdict.

The judgment notwithstanding the verdict is affirmed.

■
HEANEY, CIRCUIT JUDGE, dissenting. The only issue is whether the repossession
of appellant’s automobile constituted a breach of the peace by

creating a “risk of invoking violence.” See Ford Motor
Credit Co. v. Herring, 589 S.W.2d 584, 586 (Ark. 1979). The trial jury found
that it did

and awarded $5,000 for conversion. Because that
determination was in my view a reasonable one, I dissent from the Court’s
decision to overturn

it.

Cathy Williams was a single parent living with her two small
children in a trailer home in Van Buren, Arkansas. On December 1, 1977, at

approximately 4:30 a. m., she was awakened by noises in her
driveway. She went into the night to investigate and discovered a wrecker and
its

crew in the process of towing away her car. According to the
trial court, “she ran outside to stop them * * * but she made no strenuous
protests to

their actions.” (Emphasis added.) In fact, the wrecker crew
stepped

#367

between her and the car when she sought to retrieve personal
items from inside it, although the men retrieved some of the items for her. The

commotion created by the incident awakened neighbors in the
vicinity.

Facing the wrecker crew in the dead of night, Cathy Williams
did everything she could to stop them, short of introducing physical force to

meet the presence of the crew. The confrontation did not
result in violence only because Ms. Williams did not take such steps and was
otherwise

powerless to stop the crew.

The controlling law is the UCC, which authorizes self-help
repossession only when such is done “without breach of the peace * * * .”

Ark.Stat.Ann. § 85–9–503 (Supp. 1981). The majority
recognizes that one important policy consideration underlying this restriction
is to

discourage “extrajudicial acts by citizens when those acts
are fraught with the likelihood of resulting violence.” Despite this, the
majority holds

that no reasonable jury could find that the confrontation in
Cathy Williams’ driveway at 4:30 a. m. created a risk of violence. I cannot
agree. At a

minimum, the largely undisputed facts created a jury
question. The jury found a breach of the peace and this Court has no sound,
much less

compelling, reason to overturn that determination.

Indeed, I would think that sound application of the
self-help limitation might require a directed verdict in favor of Ms. Williams,
but

certainly not against her. If a “night raid” is conducted
without detection and confrontation, then, of course, there could be no breach
of the

peace. But where the invasion is detected and a
confrontation ensues, the repossessor should be under a duty to retreat and
turn to judicial

process. The alternative which the majority embraces is to
allow a repossessor to proceed following confrontation unless and until
violence

results in fact. Such a rule invites tragic consequences
which the law should seek to prevent, not to encourage. I would reverse the
trial court and

reinstate the jury’s verdict.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .In a series of decisions in the 1970 s, the U.S. Supreme
Court wavered back and forth as to whether statutory provisions authorizing
summary

repossession or disposal of personal property without a
prior hearing violate the Due Process Clause. See Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S.
67 ( 1972 ) (due

process violated by statute authorizing replevin of personal
property upon application and posting of bond with no hearing before
repossession takes

place); Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600 ( 1974 )
(due process not violated by state statute authorizing “sequestration” of
personal property

pursuant to ex parte order of judge); North Georgia
Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., 419 U.S. 601 ( 1975 ) (due process violated
by state statute

permitting garnishment of bank account based on conclusory
allegations before nonjudicial officer); Flagg Brothers, Inc. v. Brooks, 436
U.S. 149 ( 1978 )

(due process not implicated by provision of Uniform
Commercial Code authorizing warehouse to sell goods in its custody to

```



368



```

satisfy unpaid debt for warehouse services). Some lower
courts interpreted these decisions to mean that self-help repossession that is
authorized by

Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code triggers a due
process hearing right. See, e.g., Watson v. Branch County Bank, 380 F. Supp.
945 (W.D. Mich.

1974 ). But especially after _Flagg Brothers_ was decided in
1978 , most courts concluded that procedural due process does not apply to
self-help

repossession under what was then UCC § 9 – 503 (for the
current version, see Revised UCC § 9 – 609 ), because such a repossession does
not entail any

“state action.” Given the widespread adoption of the UCC by
the states, creditors have tended to rely on the UCC self-help remedy rather
than statutory

remedies that might trigger due process hearing requirements
under _Fuentes_ or _Di-Chem_. As a result, persons who own personal property
subject to a

lien covered by UCC Article 9 have only those rights
available under state constitutional law or under interpretations of UCC § 9 –
609. See Alan R.

Madry, State Action and the Due Process of Self-Help; _Flagg
Bros._ Redux, 62 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 1 ( 2000 ).

2 .There is considerable irony in the fact that the UCC’s
self-help repossession remedy has generally been held not to trigger due
process, whereas

replevin actions or garnishment proceedings require due
process hearings. Replevin and garnishment statutes typically give owners of
personal property

significantly _greater_ protection than they get in a
self-help repossession. But by exempting self-help from due process
constraints, the courts have

created a powerful incentive for lending companies to use
self-help, rather than more protective statutory mechanisms. Contrast the
reasoning of

decisions like _Berg v. Wiley_ , which hold that the
creation of summary statutory remedies for recovery of possession of real
property eliminates common-

law self-help remedies. Few, if any, courts have adopted
this line of reasoning with respect to self-help repossession of personal
property. As a result,

most repossessions of personal property today use self-help.

3 .As a further irony, consider that if S & S Recovery,
Inc. had towed away Ms. Williams’s car by mistake, when it really intended to
repossess her

neighbor’s car, Ms. Williams might be forced to use a
replevin action to get her car back. She could not use Article 9 ’s self-help
remedy, because she has

no security interest in the car, and Article 9 only covers
security interests. If Williams were forced to use replevin to get her car
back, S & S Recovery

would be entitled to a due process hearing before it could
be ordered to return the car to her.

4 .Notwithstanding these ironies, does it make sense as a
policy matter to permit self-help repossession of personal property (at least
when the

owner is in default on a loan secured by the property) but
not to permit self-help repossession of commercial real estate (as held in
_Berg v. Wiley_ )?

Which position do you think is best: no self-help
repossession of either real or personal property; self-help possession of
either real or personal property

provided there is no breach of the peace; or self-help
repossession of personal property without breach of the peace, but no self-help
repossession of real

property?

```



369



```

5 .In footnote 6 , the court observes that one policy
justification for permitting self-help repossession of personal property
subject to a security

interest is that it benefits “debtors in general by making
credit available at lower costs.” Can you spell out the argument as to why
self-help repossession

would have this effect? If self-help repossession would
lower the costs of borrowing to finance an automobile or other personal
property, would

permitting self-help repossession of real property reduce
the amount of rent that tenants in general must pay?

6 .Which do you think was probably more unsettling to the
individual property holder’s sense of personal security and autonomy: Wiley’s
locking

out Berg while her restaurant was closed for remodeling, or
S & S Recovery’s showing up at 4 : 30 a.m. to tow Williams’s Mustang from
her driveway?

### B. LIMITS TO OWNER SOVEREIGNTY

Although the property owner has an impressive arsenal of
criminal, civil, and self-help remedies to vindicate the right to exclude
others, the

law has always recognized limits to owner sovereignty. We
consider here five categories of exceptions. As always when one has a basic
rule (the

right to exclude) subject to exceptions, there is a question
whether the exceptions should be stated in a rule-like fashion, or whether the
whole

issue (right to exclude or not) should be resolved in a
case-by-case fashion with more attention to the balance of interests in each
case. Keep this

underlying question of legal design in mind when considering
the following materials.

Supreme Court of Vermont, 1908.

■
MUNSON, J. It is alleged as the ground of recovery that on the 13th day of
November 1904, the defendant was the owner of a certain island in

Lake Champlain, and of a certain dock attached thereto,
which island and dock were then in charge of the defendant’s servant; that the
plaintiff

was then possessed of and sailing upon said lake a certain
loaded sloop, on which were the plaintiff and his wife and two minor children;
that

there then arose a sudden and violent tempest, whereby the
sloop and the property and persons therein were placed in great danger of
destruction;

that, to save these from destruction or injury, the
plaintiff was compelled to, and did, moor the sloop to defendant’s dock; that
the defendant, by

his servant, unmoored the sloop, whereupon it was driven
upon the shore by the tempest, without the plaintiff’s fault; and that the
sloop and its

contents were thereby destroyed, and the plaintiff and his
wife and children cast into the lake and upon the shore, receiving injuries.
This claim is

set forth in two counts—one in trespass, charging that the
defendant by his servant with force and arms willfully and

#370

designedly unmoored the sloop; the other in case, alleging
that it was the duty of the defendant by his servant to permit the plaintiff to
moor his

sloop to the dock, and to permit it to remain so moored
during the continuance of the tempest, but that the defendant by his servant,
in disregard

of this duty, negligently, carelessly, and wrongfully
unmoored the sloop. Both counts are demurred to generally.

There are many cases in the books which hold that necessity,
and an inability to control movements inaugurated in the proper exercise of a

strict right, will justify entries upon land and
interferences with personal property that would otherwise have been trespasses.
A reference to a

few of these will be sufficient to illustrate the doctrine.
In Mitten v. Faudrye, Popham 161, 79 Eng. Rep. 1259 (K.B. 1626), trespass was
brought

for chasing sheep, and the defendant pleaded that the sheep
were trespassing upon his land, and that he with a little dog chased them out,
and

that, as soon as the sheep were off his land, he called in
the dog. It was argued that, although the defendant might lawfully drive the
sheep from

his own ground with a dog, he had no right to pursue them
into the next ground; but the court considered that the defendant might drive
the sheep

from his land with a dog, and that the nature of a dog is
such that he cannot be withdrawn in an instant, and that, as the defendant had
done his

best to recall the dog, trespass would not lie. * * * If one
have a way over the land of another for his beasts to pass, and the beasts,
being properly

driven, feed [on] the grass by morsels in passing, or run
out of the way and are promptly pursued and brought back, trespass will not
lie. See Vin.

Ab. Trespass, K. a, pl. 1. A traveler on a highway who finds
it obstructed from a sudden and temporary cause may pass upon the adjoining
land

without becoming a trespasser because of the necessity.
Henn’s Case, W. Jones, 296 (1632); Campbell v. Race, 61 Mass. (7 Cush.) 408
(1851);

Hyde v. Jamaica, 27 Vt. 443, 459 (1855); Morey v.
Fitzgerald, 56 Vt. 487 (1884). An entry upon land to save goods which are in
danger of being

lost or destroyed by water or fire is not a trespass. 21
Hen. VII, 27; Vin. Ab. Trespass, H. a, 4, pl. 24, K. a, pl. 3. In Proctor v.
Adams, 113 Mass.

376 (1873), the defendant went upon the plaintiff’s beach
for the purpose of saving and restoring to the lawful owner a boat which had
been

driven ashore, and was in danger of being carried off by the
sea; and it was held no trespass.

This doctrine of necessity applies with special force to the
preservation of human life. One assaulted and in peril of his life may run
through

the close of another to escape from his assailant. 37 Hen.
VII, pl. 26. One may sacrifice the personal property of another to save his
life or the

lives of his fellows. In Mouse’s Case, 12 Co. 63, 77 Eng.
Rep. 1341 (K.B. 1609), the defendant was sued for taking and carrying away the

plaintiff’s casket and its contents. It appeared that the
ferryman of Gravesend took 47 passengers into his barge to pass to London,
among whom

were the plaintiff and defendant; and the barge being upon
the water a great tempest happened, and a strong wind, so that the barge

#371

and all the passengers were in danger of being lost if
certain ponderous things were not cast out, and the defendant thereupon cast
out the

plaintiff’s casket. It was resolved that in case of
necessity, to save the lives of the passengers, it was lawful for the
defendant, being a passenger,

to cast the plaintiff’s casket out of the barge; that, if
the ferryman surcharge the barge, the owner shall have his remedy upon the
surcharge

against the ferryman, but that if there be no surcharge, and
the danger accrue only by the act of God, as by tempest, without fault of the
ferryman,

every one ought to bear his loss to safeguard the life of a
man.

It is clear that an entry upon the land of another may be
justified by necessity, and that the declaration before us discloses a
necessity for

mooring the sloop. But the defendant questions the
sufficiency of the counts because they do not negative the existence of natural
objects to

which the plaintiff could have moored with equal safety. The
allegations are, in substance, that the stress of a sudden and violent tempest

compelled the plaintiff to moor to defendant’s dock to save
his sloop and the people in it. The averment of necessity is complete, for it
covers not

only the necessity of mooring to the dock; and the details
of the situation which created this necessity, whatever the legal requirements
regarding

them, are matters of proof, and need not be alleged. It is
certain that the rule suggested cannot be held applicable irrespective of
circumstance,

and the question must be left for adjudication upon
proceedings had with reference to the evidence [on] the charge. * * *

Judgment affirmed and cause remanded.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .You may be wondering why the owner’s servant cast off the
Ploofs. A recent study of the case reveals the background of social conflict in
the

Lake Champlain area giving rise to the dispute. The Ploofs
were a French Canadian family who lived on their boat and transported firewood
and other

goods on the lake. In keeping with prevailing bigotry
against French Canadians at the time, the Ploofs were disliked and were accused
of being “pirates”

and thieves and even chased away with guns by the genteel
residents. Joan Vogel, Cases in Conflict: Lake Champlain Wars, Gentrification
and _Ploof v.

Putnam_ , 45 St. Louis U. L.J. 791 , 798 – 99 ( 2001 ). The
author contends that this background of conflict is essential to understanding
how the dispute

arose. Is it relevant to the result? Should it be?

2 .Some of the incidents discussed by the court involve
great forces of nature like storms, whereas others involve the behavior of
animals like dogs

and cattle, and still others involve a response to acts of
third parties, like running from an assailant. What are the common elements in
these examples

that cause courts to treat them as overcoming the owner’s
right to exclude that otherwise would prevail? Could the mobile home company in
_Jacque v.

Steenberg Homes_ , Chapter I, have raised a defense to
trespass

```



372



```

based on necessity? If not, why not? (Consider _Dwyer v.
Staunton_ , [ 1947 ] 4 D.L.R. 393 (Alberta Dist. Ct.), summarized in Note 5
after _Jacque._ )

3 .In another famous necessity case, _Vincent v. Lake Erie
Transp. Co._ , 124 N.W. 221 (Minn. 1910 ), the defendant kept its boat tied to
a dock longer

than the plaintiff wanted it to remain there, in order to
keep the boat from being destroyed by a violent storm arising on Lake Superior.
The wind and

waves caused the boat to damage the dock. The court held
that the defendant was justified in keeping the boat tied to the dock, but that
the defendant

had to pay the plaintiff for the damage caused to the dock.
Is this an application of the principle of restitution, considered more fully
infra Part C? Note

that both the mistaken improver and the ship-owner tying up
to the dock can be viewed as trespassers, and both claim that special
circumstances make

strict enforcement of exclusion rights by injunction
inappropriate. See generally Symposium: _Vincent v. Lake Erie Transportation
Co._ and the Doctrine

of Necessity, Issues in Legal Scholarship ( 2005 ),
available at https://www. degruyter. com/ journal/ key/ ils/ 5 / 2 /
html?lang=en.

4 .The exception to the right to exclude recognized in
_Ploof_ and _Vincent_ can be characterized in different ways. One is to say
that conditions of

necessity shift the right to exclude from the landowner to
the person entering under conditions of necessity. Thus, for example, if the
intruders are

resisted by the landowner, they are now privileged to use
self-help—including potentially reasonable force—to enter. The plaintiff
“intruders” in _Ploof_

did state a cause of action in trespass, which hints that
they regarded the repulsion by the defendant’s servant to be a violation of
their superior rights to

occupy the dock. Another characterization would be to say
that the landowner still has the right to exclude, but under conditions of
necessity can only

vindicate that right by seeking a payment of damages for any
damage caused by the intruder. Necessity suspends other modes of protection
that the

landowner can ordinarily invoke, such as the privilege of
self-help and the right to obtain an injunction. In effect, the intruder who is
subject to forces of

necessity can “take” the entitlement without the owner’s
consent, but when he does so, must pay the owner just compensation. (In the
vocabulary

introduced by Calabresi and Melamed, which we take up in
Chapter IX, the entitlement still belongs to the landowner but is now protected
by a

“liability rule” rather than a “property rule.”) A third
characterization would be that the necessity defense negates any liability in
tort for trespass, and

the damages are a form of restitution for unjust enrichment
of the intruder. Which of these characterizations is the best?

5 .Would you apply the rule of compensation recognized in
_Vincent v. Lake Erie Transp. Co._ to all cases of necessity? Should it be
extended to

cases like _Ploof_ or _Mouse’s Case_ (discussed in _Ploof_ )
where the intrusion is justified by the need to save human life? What about
cases involving

animals that eat morsels of grass on the side of a
designated right of way?

#### Fisher v. Steward

```



New Hampshire Supreme Court, 1804.



Smith 60.



```

Trover for a swarm of bees. There was a second count for two
hundred pounds of honey in the comb.

The case was, the plaintiffs found a swarm of bees in a tree
on the (defendant’s) land in Claremont, marked the tree, and notified the

defendant, who cut down the tree, September, 1803, and
converted the honey to his own use. * * *

At the trial there was some dispute whether the plaintiffs
or one of the defendant’s family first discovered the bees, and whether the

plaintiffs gave notice of the finding and marking the tree.
The other parts of the case were proved.

The Court summed up, and observed that two questions had
been made on the trial: first, whether the plaintiffs first discovered the
bees;

and, secondly, supposing they did, whether the property in
the honey was in them.

The first is a question of evidence proper for the
consideration of the jury.

The second is a question of law, and one about which the
Court entertained no doubt. The plaintiffs do not pretend to have any property
in

the land or in the tree, nor had they any property in the
bees. How then came they by a property in the honey? It must have been by
occupancy.

But how did they occupy, or appropriate the honey to
themselves? They saw the bees enter the tree, they heard them make a noise near
the tree,

and they marked the tree. The two first gave no right; they
do not amount to occupancy. The marking of the tree was a trespass, and
consequently

can avail the plaintiffs nothing. The doctrine contended for
by plaintiffs is injurious to the rights of property. Till the bees occupied
the tree in

question, it is not pretended that plaintiffs had any right
in it. What gave them a right? Having seen a swarm of bees, in which they had
no

property, occupying it? This circumstance, whether the
effect of accident, or the result of labor and skill, cannot lessen the rights
of the owner of

the soil. Will it be pretended that plaintiffs thereby
acquired a right to the tree? If they acquired a title to the honey, they must
necessarily have a

right to take it away, to cut down the tree, to pass over
the defendant’s land for the purpose, & c. Admitting the plaintiffs could
acquire property

in a swarm of bees, or in the honey, by finding, in some
cases, they could not do so in the present case, because such right or property
interferes

with the rights and property clearly vested in defendant; it
is inconsistent with it; it lessens its value at least. It is much more
consonant to our

ideas of property to say, that the bees

#374

and honey in the defendant’s trees belong to him in the same
manner and for the same reasons as all mines and minerals belong to the owner
of

the soil.

Will it be pretended by the plaintiffs that they could have
put, without defendant’s permission, a swarm of bees into defendant’s tree, and

there kept them till they had made honey; and then, in case
he cut down the tree, maintained trespass for the cutting, or trover for the
honey? One

would suppose the present case was not stronger than that;
here they had no right to the bees.

It has been said, that, by the usage of this part of the
State, the person who finds bees acquires a property in them wherever found. We

recognize no such usage. We have no local customs or usages
which are binding in one part of the State and not in another. If this be the
law

here, it must be so in every other part of the State.

Verdict for defendant.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Recall the principle that captured wild animals belong to
the owner of the land where they are captured, sometimes called _ratione loci_
or _ratione

soli_ , which is alluded to in _Pierson v. Post_ , excerpted
in Chapter II. Post (the huntsman) alleged in his complaint that the fox had
been hunted on a “wild

and uninhabited, unpossessed and waste land, called the
beach.” The court seized on this allegation to sidestep English precedent,
observing that the

English decisions “have either been discussed and decided
upon the principles of their positive statute regulations, or have arisen
between the huntsman

and the owner of the land upon which beasts _ferae naturae_
have been apprehended; the former claiming them by title of occupancy, and the
latter

_ratione soli_ .” The _Pierson_ court was therefore able to
decide the dispute based solely on the principle of first possession, rather
than having to sort out

the competing claims of first possession and _ratione soli_
, a species of accession doctrine. Could the court in _Fisher_ have ruled for
the defendant on the

ground that the plaintiff had not performed acts sufficient
to constitute possession of the bees or the hive? Recall in this connection the
discussion in

_Pierson v. Post_ about what acts are required to establish
possession. Or is it that the trespass on private land loomed too large for the
court?

2 .The tension between first possession and accession in
wild animal law is nowhere greater than with respect to bees. Barbeyrac, a
natural rights

thinker discussed in _Pierson v. Post_ , thought that a hive
belongs to the first person who discovers the tree where it is located, and
marks it as his own.

Blackstone equivocated on the subject, noting that there is
something to be said for giving the hive to the owner of the soil where it is
located, but

offering an exception where a swarm “flie from and out of my
hive * * * as long as I can keep them in sight, and have the power to pursue
them.” 2

William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England *
392 – 93. (How would one prove this?) _Ratione soli_ —an instance of the
principle of

accession—may loom especially large with respect to bees
because bees make hives in fixed locations, and the economic value of the bees
(i.e., the

honey they produce)

```



375



```

inheres in this fixed location. Given this feature, it may
be that American courts have been rather more sympathetic to the idea that
ownership of bees

goes with ownership of land than they have been to the
notion that ownership of other types of wild animals killed or captured on
private land goes with

the land. See Dale D. Goble & Eric T. Freyfogle,
Wildlife Law 133 – 145 ( 2002 ) (noting that early American courts were hostile
to English doctrines

about ownership of land giving rise to control over wildlife
on the land, and were sympathetic with the idea of a general privilege to hunt
on any

unenclosed and uncultivated land). Another wild animal that
builds elaborate homes in fixed locations is the beaver—recall in this
connection Harold

Demsetz’s explanation (in Chapter III) of the way private
property rights in beaver territories emerged among certain Native American
tribes when the

value of beaver pelts rose.

3 .As we have also seen, accession depends on some
combination of psychological salience and practical utility. Presumably, the
proponent of the

custom here and perhaps the community creating the custom
(if it was one) relied on salience and utility. And yet the court refused legal
recognition of

the custom because it could not be shown to obtain in all of
the state of New Hampshire. Why is this important? Is the court worried about
holding non-

community members to an in-group custom (see Ghen v. Rich,
excerpted in Chapter III).

4 .Perhaps the most famous local, albeit widespread,
property custom in the United States limiting a landowner’s right to exclude is
that of

affording hunters a license to hunt over unenclosed
unimproved land. Over time, owners became able to opt out of the custom through
posting the land.

This custom arose in opposition to traditional English law
(think Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham). This custom also made an
appearance in a

U.S. Supreme Court case. McKee v. Gratz, 260 U.S. 127 , 136
( 1922 ) (Holmes, J.) (“[There is a] common understanding with regard to the
large

expanses of unenclosed and uncultivated land in many parts
at least of this country. Over these it is customary to wander, shoot and fish
at will until the

owner sees fit to prohibit it. A license may be implied from
the habits of the country.”). Even to this day, a large number of states have
so-called “posting

laws,” which permit anyone to hunt on rural land unless “No
Hunting” or “No Trespassing” signs have been prominently posted. See, e.g.,
Fla. Stat.

§ 588. 10 , § 810. 09 ; N.D. Cent. Code § 20. 1 – 01 – 18 (
2002 ). Mark R. Sigmon, Hunting and Posting on Private Land in America, 54 Duke
L.J. 549 ( 2004 )

(“Twenty-nine states currently require private landowners to
post their land to exclude hunters, twenty-seven of these states by statute.”).
These laws

impose an affirmative burden of notification on the
possessor of land for asserting the right to exclude. If the owner does not
make the required

notification, then the right to exclude is subordinated to
the customary right to hunt on unenclosed and uncultivated land owned by
another. The trend

appears to be moving gradually away from presumed access for
hunters unless the land is posted and instead toward a requirement of owner
permission

to hunt. Posting may soon migrate to a centralized system
online. See Richard M. Hynes, Posted: Notice and the Right to Exclude, 45 Ariz.
St. L.J. 949

( 2013 ).

```

```

5 .In England and some other commonwealth countries like New
Zealand, laws have been enacted that codify and extend a customary “right to

roam” over rural land. These laws allow persons who like to
“ramble” in open countryside to gain access to designated private property
without first

seeking permission from the owner. See Jerry L. Anderson,
Britain’s Right to Roam: Redefining the Landowner’s Bundle of Sticks, 19 Geo.
Int’l Envtl.

L. Rev. 375 ( 2007 ). The land that may be accessed must
first be identified by officials as “mountain, moor, heath or down or
registered common land,”

and mapped after consultation with landowners. Landowners
are entitled to designate up to 28 days per year on which the land can be
closed to

ramblers. Scotland has enacted an even more extensive right
to roam, which involves elaborate balancing of the interests of landowners and
those who

roam. John A. Lovett, Progressive Property in Action: The
Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 , 89 Neb. L. Rev. 301 ( 2011 ). A recent
empirical study

based on differential impact on various areas finds a
significant and substantial negative effect on property values from the passage
of the Countryside

and Rights of Way Act in England and Wales in 2000. Jonathan
Klick & Gideon Parchomovsky, The Value of the Right to Exclude: An
Empirical

Assessment, 165 U. Pa. L. Rev. 917 ( 2016 ). What might
explain the adoption of right-to-roam laws in the twenty-first century, after a
long period in

which rural landowners were understood to have the right to
exclude such intrusions? Similar issues have arisen in the U.S., where walking
is less

popular, with respect to outdoor recreational vehicle use on
public and private land. See Byron Kahr, The Right to Exclude Meets the Right
to Ride:

Private Property, Public Recreation, and the Rise of
Off-Road Vehicles, 28 Stan. Envtl. L.J. 51 ( 2009 ).

### 3 .PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS LAWS

Another important qualification on the right to exclude
comes from public accommodations laws. Broadly speaking, the law distinguishes

between property not open to the public, like homes,
factories, and business offices, and property that offers itself as a “public
accommodation.”

Owners of property not open to the public have long enjoyed
broad sovereign authority to exclude others. At common law, subject to the
defense

of necessity and exceptions based on local custom, the owner
of property not open to the public was said to have the right to exclude others
for

“any reason or no reason at all.” Owners of public
accommodations, in contrast, have a much more qualified right to exclude.
Specifically, they

are subject to a general duty of nondiscrimination among
customers, meaning they must provide services to customers on a first-come,
first-

served basis, and they must charge customers only reasonable
rates for the services they provide.

The law of public accommodations can be traced to certain
implied duties that the common law imposed on persons who held themselves

forth to the public as being engaged in one of the “common
callings.” Thus Blackstone wrote:

#377

There is also in law always an implied contract with a
common inn-keeper, to secure his guest’s goods in his inn; with a common

carrier or bargemaster, to be answerable for the goods he
carries; with a common farrier, that he shoes a horse well, without laming

him; with a common taylor, or other workman, that he
performs his business in a workmanlike manner: in which if they fail, an action

on the case lies to recover damages for such breach of their
general undertaking. But if I employ a person to transact any of these

concerns, whose common profession and business it is not,
the law implies no such general undertaking; but in order to charge him

with damages, a special agreement is required. Also if an
inn-keeper, or other victualler, hangs out a sign and opens his house for

travelers, it is an implied engagement to entertain all
persons who travel that way; and upon this universal assumpsit an action on the

case will lie against him for damages, if he without good
reason refuses to admit a traveller.

3 William Blackstone, Commentaries *164.

Over time, these implied duties came to be focused on a
narrower list of businesses associated with travel, generally referred to as
“inn

keepers and common carriers.” See, e.g., A.K.
Sandoval-Strausz, Travelers, Strangers, and Jim Crow: Law, Public
Accommodations, and Civil

Rights in America, 23 Law & Hist. Rev. 53 (2005)
(arguing that by the mid-nineteenth century the common law imposed special
duties to serve

only on businesses that served travelers); cf. Joseph
William Singer, No Right to Exclude: Public Accommodations and Private
Property, 90 Nw.

U. L. Rev. 1283 (1996) (contending that before the Civil
War, all businesses open to the public were subject to a duty to serve, and
arguing that

the duty narrowed afterwards).

There has long been a debate over the reasons that led to
this narrowing:

In a series of books and articles, [Bruce] Wyman explained
this narrowing by arguing that common carrier duties were applied

only to those occupations that continued to exhibit
effective monopoly. These duties were applicable in earlier times because

transportation was very limited and because each town’s
craftsmen, therefore, had monopolies in their own services. Later the duties of

common calling focused on innkeepers and carriers because
those occupations entailed legal or economic monopolies. By contrast to

Wyman, Charles Burdick, also writing in the early 1900s,
challenged this view, noting that common carrier duties were often imposed

without a specific finding of monopoly power. Burdick argued
that the callings could be identified by a number of indicators that the

enterprise was considered “public.” First, common carrier
duties applied to those activities which historically had been provided

#378

by the king or under the king’s writ. Second, common carrier
duties applied when the public had assisted the enterprise in some

manner—through public spending, a grant of eminent domain
authority, the use of public property, or the establishment of a legal

monopoly. When the legislature had acted in one of these
manners, the courts drew on the law of common callings to require that the

enterprise serve all.

James B. Speta, A Common Carrier Approach to Internet
Connection, 54 Fed. Comm. L.J. 225, 255–56 (2002).

Joseph Singer has advanced a third theory: He argues that
the narrowing of public accommodations duties to innkeepers and common

carriers was a product of the Jim Crow era of the late
nineteenth century when many states, especially in the South, sought to
maintain the

subordinated position of African-Americans. See Singer,
supra, at 1390–1411. In order to achieve this discriminatory objective, the
duty to serve

was narrowed to innkeepers and common carriers, and the
businesses which remained subject to this narrowed duty were deemed to satisfy
it by

providing “separate but equal” facilities to persons of
different races. The Supreme Court facilitated this program by endorsing the
narrowed

conception of public accommodations in the Civil Rights
Cases , 109 U.S. 3 , 25 (1883), and upholding the separate-but-equal
interpretation of the

duty against an equal protection challenge in Plessy v.
Ferguson , 163 U.S. 537 (1896). Notice, however, that Singer’s theory that the
narrowing

was a product of racism presupposes that the common-law duty
was significantly broader than innkeepers and common-carriers before the Jim

Crow era—a revisionist claim that remains controversial.
See, e.g., Sandoval-Strausz, supra; Note, The Antidiscrimination Principle in
the

Common Law, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1993, 1996 (1989).

Whatever the underlying reason for restricting the category
of public accommodations to innkeepers and common carriers, the duties

imposed on these enterprises were relatively limited ones.
As summarized by Professor Speta, there were two important duties. Speta,
supra, at

257–58. The most fundamental obligation was the duty to
serve any person who requested service, provided it was available. Thus,
innkeepers

and common carriers could not refuse service to persons for
“any reason or no reason at all.” They would have to have some good reason to

refuse service, such as the firm’s capacity was exhausted,
or the customer would interfere with the quality of service provided to other
customers.

Second, innkeepers and common carriers had to charge prices
that were “reasonable.” This did not mean they had to charge exactly the same

price to different recipients of the same service. Different
customers could be charged different prices, as long as each fell within the
zone of

reasonable charges.

In a further mutation, the category of enterprises known as
innkeepers and common carriers eventually came to be known as public

accommodations. Modern public accommodations laws have been

#379

influenced by antidiscrimination laws, most prominently
Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000a (2000). This
landmark

statute provides that all persons are “entitled to the full
and equal enjoyment” of places of “public accommodation” without
“discrimination or

segregation on the ground of race, color, religion or
national origin.” Id. § 2000a(a). “Public accommodation,” in turn, is defined
to include (1)

“any inn, hotel, motel, or other establishment which
provides lodging to transient guests;” (2) “any restaurant, cafeteria,
lunchroom, lunch

counter, soda fountain, or other facility principally
engaged in selling food for consumption on the premises;” and (3) “any motion
picture house,

theater, concert hall, sports arena, stadium or other place
of exhibition or entertainment.” Id. § 2000a(b). This definition is broader
than the

common-law definition (imprecise though it was). The Civil
Rights Act only prohibits discrimination based on race or other forbidden

categories. But will its broader definition of “public
accommodation” filter back and influence the judicial understanding of the
types of

businesses subject to common-law duties of nondiscrimination
and reasonableness?

### 4 .PUBLIC POLICY

The most general exception to the right to exclude—which has
been developed primarily by the courts of New Jersey—is that owner

sovereignty should give way to considerations of public
policy. In this conception, the right to exclude is always subject to a
balancing test in

which competing social interests must be weighed. The idea
was introduced in the following case, and has been elaborated upon and
qualified in

subsequent decisions.

#### State v. Shack

```



Supreme Court of New Jersey, 1971.



277 A. 2 d 369.



```

■
WEINTRAUB, C.J. Defendants entered upon private property to aid migrant
farmworkers employed and housed there. Having refused to depart

upon the demand of the owner, defendants were charged with
violating N.J.S.A. 2A:170–31 which provides that “[a]ny person who trespasses
on

any lands * * * after being forbidden so to trespass by the
owner * * * is a disorderly person and shall be punished by a fine of not more
than

$50.” Defendants were convicted in the Municipal Court of
Deerfield Township and again on appeal in the County Court of Cumberland County

on a trial de novo. We certified their further appeal before
argument in the Appellate Division.

Before us, no one seeks to sustain these convictions. The
complaints were prosecuted in the Municipal Court and in the County Court by

counsel engaged by the complaining landowner, Tedesco.
However Tedesco did not respond to this appeal, and the county prosecutor,
while

defending abstractly the constitutionality of the trespass
statute,

#380

expressly disclaimed any position as to whether the statute
reached the activity of these defendants.

Complainant, Tedesco, a farmer, employs migrant workers for
his seasonal needs. As part of their compensation, these workers are housed

at a camp on his property.

Defendant Tejeras is a field worker for the Farm Workers
Division of the Southwest Citizens Organization for Poverty Elimination, known

by the acronym SCOPE, a nonprofit corporation funded by the
Office of Economic Opportunity pursuant to an act of Congress, 42 U.S.C.A.

§§ 2861–2864. The role of SCOPE includes providing for the
“health services of the migrant farm worker.”

Defendant Shack is a staff attorney with the Farm Workers
Division of Camden Regional Legal Services, Inc., known as “CRLS,” also a

nonprofit corporation funded by the Office of Economic
Opportunity pursuant to an act of Congress, 42 U.S.C.A. § 2809(a)(3). The
mission of

CRLS includes legal advice and representation for these
workers.

Differences had developed between Tedesco and these
defendants prior to the events which led to the trespass charges now before us.
Hence

when defendant Tejeras wanted to go upon Tedesco’s farm to
find a migrant worker who needed medical aid for the removal of 28 sutures, he

called upon defendant Shack for his help with respect to the
legalities involved. Shack, too, had a mission to perform on Tedesco’s farm; he

wanted to discuss a legal problem with another migrant
worker there employed and housed. Defendants arranged to go to the farm
together.

Shack carried literature to inform the migrant farmworkers
of the assistance available to them under federal statutes, but no mention
seems to

have been made of that literature when Shack was later
confronted by Tedesco.

Defendants entered upon Tedesco’s property and as they
neared the camp site where the farmworkers were housed, they were confronted by

Tedesco who inquired of their purpose. Tejeras and Shack
stated their missions. In response, Tedesco offered to find the injured worker,
and as to

the worker who needed legal advice, Tedesco also offered to
locate the man but insisted that the consultation would have to take place in

Tedesco’s office and in his presence. Defendants declined,
saying they had the right to see the men in the privacy of their living
quarters and

without Tedesco’s [supervision]. Tedesco thereupon summoned
a State Trooper who, however, refused to remove defendants except upon

Tedesco’s written complaint. Tedesco then executed the
formal complaints charging violations of the trespass statute.

I.

The constitutionality of the trespass statute, as applied
here, is challenged on several scores. * * * These constitutional claims are
not

established by any definitive holding. We think it
unnecessary to explore their validity. The reason is that we are satisfied that
under our State

#381

law the ownership of real property does not include the
right to bar access to governmental services available to migrant workers and
hence there

was no trespass within the meaning of the penal statute. The
policy considerations which underlie that conclusion may be much the same as
those

which would be weighed with respect to one or more of the
constitutional challenges, but a decision in nonconstitutional terms is more

satisfactory, because the interests of migrant workers are
more expansively served in that way than they would be if they had no more
freedom

than these constitutional concepts could be found to mandate
if indeed they apply at all.

II.

Property rights serve human values. They are recognized to
that end, and are limited by it. Title to real property cannot include dominion

over the destiny of persons the owner permits to come upon
the premises. Their well-being must remain the paramount concern of a system of

law. Indeed the needs of the occupants may be so imperative
and their strength so weak, that the law will deny the occupants the power to

contract away what is deemed essential to their health,
welfare, or dignity.

Here we are concerned with a highly disadvantaged segment of
our society. We are told that every year farmworkers and their families

numbering more than one million leave their home areas to
fill the seasonal demand for farm labor in the United States. The Migratory
Farm

Labor Problem in the United States (1969 Report of
Subcommittee on Migratory Labor of the United States Senate Committee on Labor
and

Public Welfare), p. 1. The migrant farmworkers come to New
Jersey in substantial numbers. * * *

The migrant farmworkers are a community within but apart
from the local scene. They are rootless and isolated. Although the need for
their

labors is evident, they are unorganized and without economic
or political power. It is their plight alone that summoned government to their
aid.

In response, Congress provided under Title III–B of the
Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 ( 42 U.S.C.A. § 2701 et seq.) for “assistance
for

migrant and other seasonally employed farmworkers and their
families.” Section 2861 states “the purpose of this part is to assist migrant
and

seasonal farmworkers and their families to improve their
living conditions and develop skills necessary for a productive and
self-sufficient life in

an increasingly complex and technological society.” * * *

These ends would not be gained if the intended beneficiaries
could be insulated from efforts to reach them. It is in this framework that we

must decide whether the camp operator’s rights in his lands
may stand between the migrant workers and those who would aid them. The key to

that aid is communication. Since the migrant workers are
outside the mainstream of the communities in which they are housed and are
unaware

of their rights and opportunities and of the services
available to them, they can be reached only by positive efforts tailored to
that end.

#382

The Report of the Governor’s Task Force on Migrant Farm
Labor (1968) noted that “One of the major problems related to seasonal farm
labor is

the lack of adequate direct information with regard to the
availability of public services,” and that “there is a dire need to provide the
workers

with basic educational and informational material in a
language and style that can be readily understood by the migrant” (pp.
101–102). The

report stressed the problem of access and deplored the
notion that property rights may stand as a barrier, saying “In our judgment,
‘no trespass’

signs represent the last dying remnants of paternalistic
behavior” (p. 63).

A man’s right in his real property of course is not
absolute. It was a maxim of the common law that one should so use his property
as not to

injure the rights of others. Broom, Legal Maxims (10th ed.
Kersley 1939), p. 238; 39 Words and Phrases, “Sic Utere Tuo ut Alienum Non

Laedas,” p. 335. Although hardly a precise solvent of actual
controversies, the maxim does express the inevitable proposition that rights
are

relative and there must be an accommodation when they meet.
Hence it has long been true that necessity, private or public, may justify
entry

upon the lands of another. * * *

The subject is not static. As pointed out in 5 Powell, Real
Property (Rohan 1970) § 745, pp. 493–494, while society will protect the owner

in his permissible interests in land, yet

* * * [s]uch an owner must expect to find the absoluteness
      of his property rights curtailed by the organs of society, for the promotion

of the best interests of others for whom these organs also
operate as protective agencies. The necessity for such curtailments is greater

in a modern industrialized and urbanized society than it was
in the relatively simple American society of fifty, 100, or 200 years ago.

The current balance between individualism and dominance of
the social interest depends not only upon political and social ideologies,

but also upon the physical and social facts of the time and
place under discussion.

Professor Powell added in § 746, pp. 494–496:

As one looks back along the historic road traversed by the
law of land in England and in America, one sees a change from the

viewpoint that he who owns may do as he pleases with what he
owns, to a position which hesitatingly embodies an ingredient of

stewardship; which grudgingly, but steadily, broadens the
recognized scope of social interests in the utilization of things. * * *

To one seeing history through the glasses of religion, these
changes may seem to evidence increasing embodiments of the golden rule.

To one thinking in terms of political and economic
ideologies, they are likely to be labeled evidences of “social

#383

### Σ

enlightenment,” or of “creeping socialism” or even of
“communistic infiltration,” according to the individual’s assumed definitions
and

retained or acquired prejudices. With slight attention to
words or labels, time marches on toward new adjustments between

individualism and the social interests.

The process involves not only the accommodation between the
right of the owner and the interests of the general public in his use of this

property, but involves also an accommodation between the
right of the owner and the right of individuals who are parties with him in
consensual

transactions relating to the use of the property.
Accordingly substantial alterations have been made as between a landlord and
his tenant. See

Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper, 251 A.2d 268 (N.J. 1969);
Marini v. Ireland, 265 A.2d 526 (N.J. 1970).

The argument in this case understandably included the
question whether the migrant worker should be deemed to be a tenant and thus

entitled to the tenant’s right to receive visitors, or
whether his residence on the employer’s property should be deemed to be merely
incidental

and in aid of his employment, and hence to involve no
possessory interest in the realty. * * *

We see no profit in trying to decide upon a conventional
category and then forcing the present subject into it. That approach would be

artificial and distorting. The quest is for a fair
adjustment of the competing needs of the parties, in the light of the realities
of the relationship

between the migrant worker and the operator of the housing
facility.

Thus approaching the case, we find it unthinkable that the
farmer-employer can assert a right to isolate the migrant worker in any respect

significant for the worker’s well-being. The farmer, of
course, is entitled to pursue his farming activities without interference, and
this defendants

readily concede. But we see no legitimate need for a right
in the farmer to deny the worker the opportunity for aid available from
federal, State,

or local services, or from recognized charitable groups
seeking to assist him. Hence representatives of these agencies and
organizations may

enter upon the premises to seek out the worker at his living
quarters. So, too, the migrant worker must be allowed to receive visitors there
of his

own choice, so long as there is no behavior hurtful to
others, and members of the press may not be denied reasonable access to workers
who do

not object to seeing them.

It is not our purpose to open the employer’s premises to the
general public if in fact the employer himself has not done so. We do not say,

for example, that solicitors or peddlers of all kinds may
enter on their own; we may assume for the present that the employer may
regulate their

entry or bar them, at least if the employer’s purpose is not
to gain a commercial advantage for himself or if the regulation does not
deprive the

migrant worker of practical access to things he needs.

#384

And we are mindful of the employer’s interest in his own and
in his employees’ security. Hence he may reasonably require a visitor to

identify himself, and also to state his general purpose if
the migrant worker has not already informed him that the visitor is expected.
But the

employer may not deny the worker his privacy or interfere
with his opportunity to live with dignity and to enjoy associations customary
among

our citizens. These rights are too fundamental to be denied
on the basis of an interest in real property and too fragile to be left to the
unequal

bargaining strength of the parties. See Henningsen v.
Bloomfield Motors, Inc., 161 A.2d 69 (N.J. 1960); Ellsworth Dobbs, Inc. v.
Johnson, 236

A.2d 843 (N.J. 1967).

It follows that defendants here invaded no possessory right
of the farmer-employer. Their conduct was therefore beyond the reach of the

trespass statute. The judgments are accordingly reversed and
the matters remanded to the County Court with directions to enter judgments of

acquittal.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Recall that the first case in Chapter I also involved a
criminal trespass to real property. In _Jacque v. Steenberg Homes_ , the issue
was punitive

damages, but Steenberg Homes had also been fined $ 30 for
misdemeanor trespass. The _Jacque_ court concluded that the criminal fine was
insufficient to

vindicate the owner’s right to exclude. The _Shack_ court,
in contrast, finds that even a $ 50 criminal fine results in too much owner
sovereignty. What

accounts for the difference? The _Shack_ court perceives a
conflict between the rights of the property owner and the rights of persons. Is
there no such

conflict in _Jacque_? If not, why not?

2 .One important difference between _Shack_ and decisions
such as _Jacque_ is that the court implicitly treats the owner’s right to
exclude not as a rule

but as a standard. Generally speaking, rules are simple
decisional devices that take the form: If _x_ (a particular fact or condition)
then _y_ (a particular legal

result). For example, this is a rule: If a stranger crosses
the boundary of an owner’s property without permission, then the owner can have
the stranger

evicted. Rules generate legal conclusions at low cost and
without regard to whether the underlying purposes of the rule are satisfied in
any particular

case. A standard, in contrast, is a decisional device that
directly invokes some conception of the law’s purposes or goals. Generally
speaking, standards

are more complex decisional devices and are more costly to
apply, but they hold forth the promise of reaching results that are more
consistent with the

purposes or goals that the law is seeking to achieve.
_Shack_ seems to invoke a standard something like this: If a stranger crosses
the boundary of an

owner’s property without permission, then the owner can have
the stranger evicted—provided that the owner’s interest in protecting his
autonomy is

sufficiently great and the interests of other persons in
abrogating the owner’s right to exclude are not more important. Which approach
would generate a

more satisfactory result in _Shack_? Which approach provides
a more practical basis for a system of property rights that

```



385



```

governs the actions of millions of people interacting with
millions of parcels of property on a daily basis? The question of rules versus
standards

pervades the law. See Frederick Schauer, Playing by the
Rules 131 ( 1991 ). Some locate the key difference between rules and standards
in the timing of

the decision: Standards, unlike rules, rely on ex post
decisionmaking in which the decisionmaker has a greater degree of discretion,
whereas rules spell

out criteria beforehand. Others stress that rules are more
costly to create but cheaper to apply. See Louis Kaplow, Rules Versus
Standards: An Economic

Analysis, 42 Duke L.J. 557 , 608 – 17 ( 1992 ). How do these
underlying considerations bear on the situation in _Shack_? On other issues of
the extent of

owner sovereignty?

3 .On facts similar to those in _Shack_ , the Maine Supreme
Court concluded that farm workers living on housing provided by a farmer are
“tenants,”

and as such “have a right to quiet enjoyment, which includes
a right to receive visitors in their homes.” State v. DeCoster, 653 A. 2 d 891
, 894 (Me.

1995 ). In effect, the court added to the rights of farm
workers, rather than subtracting from the farmer’s right to exclude. Which
approach is better? Note

that, ordinarily, the rights that tenants have against
landlords can be modified by express lease provisions. In some circumstances,
however, courts have

held that tenants’ rights (such as the right to safe and
healthy living conditions) are nonwaivable as a matter of public policy (see
Chapter VI).

4 .Another question raised by _Shack_ is: Who has the burden
to establish an exception to the right to exclude? Should the owner be free to
impose

any conditions he wants on the public’s right of access,
unless and until someone shows that a higher legal authority (like a
legislature) has adopted a

supervening legal principle that requires him to grant
access? For example, Illinois has included in its criminal trespass statute an
exception to cover

situations like that in _State v. Shack_. 720 Ill. Comp.
Stat. § 5 / 21 – 3 (c) (“This Section does not apply to any person... invited
by [a] migrant worker or

other person so living on such land to visit him at the
place he is so living upon the land.”). Or, by opening up its land to the
migrant workers, should the

owner be taken to have relinquished the right to exclude any
person the migrant workers might invite? On the approach taken in _Shack_ , is
this

presumption irrebuttable?

5. _Shack_ has stimulated much legal commentary, and is
   often cited by those who regard the “right to exclude” as reflecting an unduly
   harsh and

individualistic conception of property. For a notable recent
defense of the New Jersey Supreme Court’s doctrine, arguing that it serves
important social

and moral functions and reminds us that ownership entails
certain duties and obligations to society at large, see Gregory S. Alexander,
The Social-

Obligation Norm in American Property Law, 94 Cornell L. Rev.
745 ( 2009 ). The same issue includes a number of responses to Alexander’s
piece as

well as his reply.

6 .You may wish to reconsider the issue presented in _Shack_
after reviewing the Supreme Court’s decision in _Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid_
, 141 S.

Ct. 2063 ( 2021 ), excerpted in Chapter X. _Cedar Point_
holds that a California statute that creates an intermittent right of access to
agricultural

```



386



```

land to seek to organize farm workers is an unconstitutional
taking of property. Is _Shack_ distinguishable because it defines the content
of state law as a

matter of common law?

Supreme Court of New Jersey, 1982.



445 A. 2 d 370.



```

■
PASHMAN, J. Since January 30, 1979, appellant Resorts International Hotel, Inc.
(Resorts) has excluded respondent, Kenneth Uston, from the

blackjack tables in its casino because Uston’s strategy
increases his chances of winning money. Uston concedes that his strategy of
card counting

can tilt the odds in his favor under the current blackjack
rules promulgated by the Casino Control Commission (Commission). However, Uston

contends that Resorts has no common law or statutory right
to exclude him because of his strategy for playing blackjack.

We hold that the Casino Control Act, N.J.S.A. 5:12–1 to –15
2 gives the Commission exclusive authority to set the rules of licensed casino

games, which includes the methods for playing those games.
The Casino Control Act therefore precludes Resorts from excluding Uston for
card

counting. Because the Commission has not exercised its
exclusive authority to determine whether card counters should be excluded, we
do not

decide whether such an exclusion would be lawful.

I

Kenneth Uston is a renowned teacher and practitioner of a
complex strategy for playing blackjack known as card counting.^1 Card counters

keep track of the playing cards as they are dealt and adjust
their betting patterns when the odds are in their favor. When used over a
period of

time, this method allegedly ensures a profitable encounter
with the casino.

Uston first played blackjack at Resorts’ casino in November
1978. Resorts took no steps to bar Uston at that time, apparently because the

Commission’s blackjack rules then in operation minimized the
advantages of card counting.

On January 5, 1979, however, a new Commission rule took
effect that dramatically improved the card counter’s odds. The new rule, which

remains in effect, restricted the reshuffling of the deck in
ways that benefited card counters. Resorts concedes that the Commission could

promulgate blackjack rules that virtually eliminate the
advantage of card counting. However, such rules would slow the game,
diminishing the

casino’s “take” and consequently its profits from blackjack
gaming.

By letter dated January 30, 1979, attorneys for Resorts
wrote to Commission Chairman Lordi, asking the Commission’s position on the

#387

legality of summarily removing card counters from its
blackjack tables. That same day, Commissioner Lordi responded in writing that
no statute

or regulation barred Resorts from excluding professional
card counters from its casino. Before the day had ended, Resorts terminated
Uston’s

career at its blackjack tables, on the basis that in its
opinion he was a professional card counter. Resorts subsequently formulated
standards for

identification of card counters and adopted a general policy
to exclude such players.^2

The Commission upheld Resorts’ decision to exclude Uston.
Relying on Garifine v. Monmouth Park Jockey Club, 148 A.2d 1 (N.J. 1959),

the Commission held that Resorts enjoys a common law right
to exclude anyone it chooses, as long as the exclusion does not violate state
and

federal civil rights laws. The Appellate Division reversed,
431 A.2d 173 (N.J. Super. 1981). Although we interpret the Casino Control Act

somewhat differently than did the Appellate Division, we
affirm that court’s holding that the Casino Control Act precludes Resorts from

excluding Uston. The Commission alone has the authority to
exclude patrons based upon their strategies for playing licensed casino games.
Any

common law right Resorts may have had to exclude Uston for
these reasons is abrogated by the act. We therefore need not decide the precise

extent of Resorts’ common law right to exclude patrons for
reasons not covered by the act. Nonetheless, we feel constrained to refute any

implication arising from the Commission’s opinion that
absent supervening statutes, the owners of places open to the public enjoy an
absolute

right to exclude patrons without good cause. We hold that
the common law right to exclude is substantially limited by a competing common
law

right of reasonable access to public places.

II

This Court has recognized that “[t]he statutory and
administrative controls over casino operations established by the [Casino
Control] Act

are extraordinarily pervasive and intensive.” Knight v.
Margate, 431 A.2d 833 (N.J. 1981). The almost 200 separate statutory provisions
“cover

virtually every facet of casino gambling and its potential
impact upon the public.” Id. at 833. * * *

Pursuant to these statutes, the Commission has promulgated
exhaustive rules on the playing of blackjack. These rules cover every

conceivable aspect of the game, from determining how the
cards are to be shuffled and cut, to providing that certain cards shall not be
dealt “until

the dealer has first announced ‘Dealer’s Card’ which shall
be stated by the dealer in a tone of voice calculated to be heard by each
person at the

table.” It is no exaggeration to state that the Commission’s
regulation of blackjack is more extensive than the entire administrative
regulation of

many industries.

#388

These exhaustive statutes and regulations make clear that
the Commission’s control over the rules and conduct of licensed casino games is

intended to be comprehensive. The ability of casino
operators to determine how the games will be played would undermine this
control and

subvert the important policy of ensuring the “credibility
and integrity of the regulatory process and of casino operations.” The
Commission has

promulgated the blackjack rules that give Uston a
comparative advantage, and it has sole authority to change those rules. There
is no indication

that Uston has violated any Commission rule on the playing
of blackjack. Put simply, Uston’s gaming is “conducted according to rules

promulgated by the Commission.” Resorts has no right to
exclude Uston on grounds that he successfully plays the game under existing
rules.

III

Resorts claimed that it could exclude Uston because it had a
common law right to exclude anyone at all for any reason. While we hold that

the Casino Control Act precludes Resorts from excluding
Uston for the reasons stated, it is important for us to address the asserted
common law

right for two reasons. First, Resorts’ contentions and the
Commission’s position concerning the common law right are incorrect. Second,
the act

has not completely divested Resorts of its common law right
to exclude.

The right of an amusement place owner to exclude unwanted
patrons and the patron’s competing right of reasonable access both have deep

roots in the common law. See Arterburn, The Origin and First
Test of Public Callings, 75 U.Pa.L.Rev. 411 (1927); Wyman, The Law of Public

Callings as a Solution of the Trust Problem, 17 Harv.L.Rev.
156 (1904). In this century, however, courts have disregarded the right of
reasonable

access in the common law of some jurisdictions at the time
the Civil War Amendments and Civil Rights Act of 1866 were passed. * * * See,
e.g.,

Ferguson v. Gies, 46 N.W. 718 (Mich. 1890) (after passage of
the Fourteenth Amendment, both the civil rights statutes and the common law

provided grounds for a non-white plaintiff to recover
damages from a restaurant owner’s refusal to serve him, because the common law
as it

existed before passage of the civil rights laws “gave to the
white man a remedy against any unjust discrimination to the citizen in all
public

places”); Donnell v. State, 48 Miss. 661 (1873) (state’s
common law includes a right of reasonable access to all public places).

The current majority American rule has for many years
disregarded the right of reasonable access,^4 granting to proprietors of
amusement

places an absolute right arbitrarily to eject or exclude any
person consistent with state and federal civil rights laws. See Annot.,
Propriety of

exclusion of persons from horseracing tracks for reasons
other than

#389

color or race, 90 A.L.R.3d 1361 (1979); Turner &
Kennedy, Exclusion, Ejection and Segregation of Theater Patrons, 32 Iowa L.Rev.
625 (1947).

See also Garifine v. Monmouth Park Jockey Club, 148 A.2d 1.

At one time, an absolute right of exclusion prevailed in
this state, though more for reasons of deference to the noted English precedent
of

Wood v. Leadbitter , 13 M & W 838, 153 Eng.Rep. 351 (Ex.
1845), than for reasons of policy. * * * It hardly bears mention that our
common law

has evolved in the intervening 70 years. * * * [T]he
decisions of this Court have recognized that “the more private property is
devoted to public

use, the more it must accommodate the rights which inhere in
individual members of the general public who use that property.” State v.
Schmid,

423 A.2d 615 (N.J. 1980).

State v. Schmid involved the constitutional right to
distribute literature on a private university campus. The Court’s approach in
that case

balanced individual rights against property rights. It is
therefore analogous to a description of the common law right of exclusion.
Balancing the

university’s interest in controlling its property against
plaintiff’s interest in access to that property to express his views, the Court
clearly refused

to protect unreasonable exclusions. Justice Handler noted
that

Regulations... devoid of reasonable standards designed to
protect both the legitimate interests of the University as an institution of

higher education and the individual exercise of expressional
freedom cannot constitutionally be invoked to prohibit the otherwise

noninjurious and reasonable exercise of [First Amendment]
freedoms. [Id. at 632]

In State v. Shack , 277 A.2d 369 (N.J. 1971), the Court held
that although an employer of migrant farm workers “may reasonably require”

those visiting his employees to identify themselves, “the
employer may not deny the worker his privacy or interfere with his opportunity
to live

with dignity and to enjoy associations customary among our
citizens.” Id. at 374. The Court reversed the trespass convictions of an
attorney and

a social services worker who had entered the property to
assist farmworkers there.

Schmid recognizes implicitly that when property owners open
their premises to the general public in the pursuit of their own property

interests, they have no right to exclude people
unreasonably. On the contrary, they have a duty not to act in an arbitrary or
discriminatory manner

toward persons who come on their premises. That duty applies
not only to common carriers, Messenger v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 37 N.J.L.

531 (E. & A. 1874), innkeepers, see Garifine, supra,
owners of gasoline service stations, Streeter v. Brogan, 274 A.2d 312 (N.J. Ch.
Div. 1971),

or to private hospitals, Doe v. Bridgeton Hospital Ass’n,
Inc., 366 A.2d 641 (N.J. 1976), but to all property owners who open their
premises to

the public. Property owners have no legitimate interest in
unreasonably excluding particular members of the public when they open their

premises for public use.

#390

No party in this appeal questions the right of property
owners to exclude from their premises those whose actions “disrupt the regular
and

essential operations of the [premises],” State v. Schmid,
423 A.2d at 631 (quoting Princeton University Regulations on solicitation), or
threaten

the security of the premises and its occupants, see State v.
Shack, 277 A.2d at 374. In some circumstances, proprietors have a duty to
remove

disorderly or otherwise dangerous persons from the premises.
See Holly v. Meyers Hotel and Tavern, Inc., 89 A.2d 6 (N.J. 1952). These common

law principles enable the casino to bar from its entire
facility, for instance, the disorderly, the intoxicated, and the repetitive
petty offender.

Whether a decision to exclude is reasonable must be
determined from the facts of each case. Respondent Uston does not threaten the

security of any casino occupant. Nor has he disrupted the
functioning of any casino operations. Absent a valid contrary rule by the
Commission,

Uston possesses the usual right of reasonable access to
Resorts International’s blackjack tables. * * *

V

In sum, absent a valid Commission regulation excluding card
counters, respondent Uston will be free to employ his card-counting strategy

at Resorts’ blackjack tables. There is currently no
Commission rule banning Uston, and Resorts has no authority to exclude him for
card

counting. However, it is not clear whether the Commission
would have adopted regulations involving card counters had it known that
Resorts

could not exclude Uston. The Court therefore continues the
temporary order banning Uston from Resorts’ blackjack tables for 90 days from
the

date of this opinion. After that time, respondent is free to
play blackjack at Resorts’ casino absent a valid Commission rule excluding him.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Ken Uston was a famous blackjack player. As noted in the
opinion he authored leading books on blackjack. His litigation exploits were
more

controversial. Uston had arrived in New Jersey after having
been treated rather roughly and excluded from casinos in Las Vegas. In New
Jersey, some

people felt he made things worse for card counters and
spoiled the game by litigating against the exclusion of card counters, because
the measures that

casinos would take to counter the counters—such as adding
decks and moving up the shuffle point—made the game of blackjack worse. Uston
and his

team were quite successful at the tables, but Uston claimed
that the casinos exaggerated the counters’ take by reporting all winning
customers as card

counters. In addition to writing books about blackjack, in
the 1980 s he wrote several books about video games such as PAC-MAN and many
about a

variety of personal computers. He died of a heart attack in
1987 in Paris. See “Ken(neth) (Senzo) Uston,” Gale Literature: Contemporary

2 .Other courts have reached the opposite conclusion about
the continued vitality of the common-law rule giving owners of entertainment
venues

absolute discretion to exclude persons from the premises.
For example, in _Brooks v. Chicago Downs Assn., Inc._ , 791 F. 2 d 512 ( 7 th
Cir. 1986 ), the court,

applying Illinois law, held that a horse racing park could
exclude a group of “self-proclaimed expert handicappers” from the park for any
reason or no

reason at all, as long as there was no discrimination based
on “race, color, creed, national origin, or sex.” In explaining why it declined
to follow _Uston_ ,

the court wrote in part:

```



As a policy matter, it is arguably unfair to allow a place
of amusement to exclude for any reason or no reason, and to be free of
accountability,



except in cases of obvious discrimination. In this case, the
general public is not only invited but, through advertising, is encouraged to
come



to the race track and wager on the races’ outcome. But the
common law allows the race track to exclude patrons, no matter if they come
from



near or far, or in reasonable reliance on representations of
accessibility. We may ultimately believe that market forces would preclude any



```

```



outrageous excesses—such as excluding anyone who has blond
hair, or (like the plaintiffs) who is from Pennsylvania, or (even more



outrageous) who has $ 250 , 000 to spend in one day of
betting. * * * [T]he premise of the consumer protection laws that the New
Jersey



Supreme Court alluded to in Uston * * * recognizes that the
reality of an imperfect market allows numerous consumer depredations.



Excluding a patron simply because he is named Adam Smith



```

```



392



```

```



arguably offends the very precepts of equality and fair
dealing expressed in everything from the antitrust statutes to the Illinois
Consumer



Fraud and Deceptive Business Practice Act.



But the market here is not so demonstrably imperfect that
there is a monopoly or any allegation of consumer fraud. Consequently, there



is no such explicit legislative directive in the context of
patrons attending horse races in Illinois—so the common law rule, relic though
it may



be, still controls.



```

Id. at 518 – 19. See also Donovan v. Grand Victoria Casino
& Resort, L.P., 934 N.E. 2 d, 1111 (Ind. 2010 ) (declining to follow
_Uston_ based on the

legislative intent behind gaming statutes).

3 .In another case involving horse racing, the New Jersey
Supreme Court reaffirmed the common law right of a race track owner to exclude
a race

horse from the track without regard to its reasons for doing
so. Marzocca v. Ferone, 461 A. 2 d 1133 (N.J. 1983 ). The New Jersey Court
distinguished

_Uston_ on the ground that it involved the exclusion of a
member of the general public, as opposed to those “who wish to perform their
vocational

activities on racetrack property.” Id. at 1137. Is this
persuasive? Wasn’t Uston a professional card player? Is there something about
horse racing that

supports giving race track owners a broader discretion to
exclude than casino owners enjoy?

4 .How weighty is the casino’s interest in _Uston_? At one
point the court notes the casino conceded that the Commission could largely
eliminate the

advantages of card counting through different rules for the
game of Blackjack, but that these rules would slow the game and thereby reduce
the house’s

take. Consider in this regard a study by Lawrence Ritter,
who has indirectly measured the transaction costs associated with a medium of
exchange by

showing the amount of advantage Las Vegas casinos forego in
order to avoid time-consuming handling of chips in games of dice. Lawrence S.
Ritter,

On the Fundamental Role of Transactions Costs in Monetary
Theory: Two Illustrations from Casino Gambling, 10 J. Money, Credit &
Banking 522 ,

524 – 28 ( 1978 ). The casinos calculate that foregoing the
advantage of making more exact change is outweighed by the greater return from
faster bets in a

context in which the house has a built-in advantage. Who is
best at weighing these considerations? Owners of casinos? The Commission?
Courts?

5 .The New Jersey Supreme Court has given special
consideration to political expression in determining whether to qualify the
right to exclude,

with mixed results. In _State v. Schmid_ , 423 A. 2 d 615
(N.J. 1980 ), Princeton University (a private institution) was denied the right
to use the law of

trespass to prevent a non-student from distributing
political literature in an orderly manner on campus. The court noted the
speaker’s strong interest in

disseminating ideas and the University’s relatively weak
interest in excluding such communications given its traditional open campus
policy and its

mission of spreading ideas. The case was later dismissed by
the U.S. Supreme Court for mootness after Princeton changed its policy.
Princeton

University v. Schmid, 455 U.S. 100 ( 1982 ). In a more
recent case, the New

```



393



```

Jersey court considered whether a private homeowners’
association could limit the posting of political signs by residents on lawns
outside individual

residents’ units. Committee for a Better Twin Rivers v. Twin
Rivers Homeowners’ Assn., 929 A. 2 d 1060 (N.J. 2007 ). The court acknowledged
that only

a few states have recognized a constitutional right to
engage in free speech on private property. Although it reaffirmed the balancing
approach of

_Schmid_ , it ruled in favor of the homeowners’ association.
The court noted that the residential community was not open to the general
public and that the

residents had alternative ways in which they could express
their views. Does this decision, coupled with _Marzocca_ (reaffirming the
common law right of

race horse tracks to exclude participants) suggest that New
Jersey may be inching back toward the mainstream in its approach to the
prerogatives of

property owners?

6 .Copyright law contains an exception for fair use, which
among other things protects a critic quoting from a work. 17 U.S.C. § 107.
Should

trespass work similarly? Consider _Woolcott v. Shubert_ ,
111 N.E. 829 (N.Y. 1916 ), in which the defendants, who operated many theaters
had excluded

from all its theaters a professional drama critic who in the
words of the complaint had “[written] and the _New York Times_ [had] published
a legitimate

and proper criticism of one of the productions controlled by
the defendants.” Id. at 829. The court did not find the theaters to be public
accommodations,

and because the critic had not been excluded on the basis of
“race, creed, or color,” the state’s 1895 Civil Rights Act did not apply (see
the materials on

antidiscrimination in the next Section). The plaintiff lost.
Should he have? Should there be a First Amendment defense to trespass for
journalists doing

undercover work for exposés? For anyone interested in
exposing wrongdoing? How would “fair trespass” work? Ben Depoorter, Fair
Trespass, 111

Colum. L. Rev. 1090 ( 2011 ).

### 5 .ANTIDISCRIMINATION LAWS

Perhaps the most important exception to the general right of
a property owner to exclude others is grounded in antidiscrimination laws. As

we have seen, owners of public accommodations were subject
to antidiscrimination rules at common law. But the Supreme Court, in Plessy v.

Ferguson , 163 U.S. 537 (1896), held that the Equal
Protection Clause was not violated if a state required common carriers to
fulfill the

antidiscrimination requirement by providing “separate but
equal” facilities for persons of different races. After Plessy was effectively
overruled

by Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U.S. 483 (1954),
separate-but-equal was dismantled in the realm of public accommodations, most

decisively under Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
But discrimination in the realm of property not open to the public has
presented a more

difficult issue. Significant restrictions have been imposed
on the right to exclude based on race, gender, religion, national origin,
familial status,

and disability—and in many jurisdictions, based on marital
status and source of income. The statutory category of sex has been variously

interpreted, and sexual orientation and gender identity

#394

are explicitly mentioned in the law of almost half the
states. For example, if you sell your home while using a real estate broker,
you cannot

exclude potential buyers based on one of these protected
categories. But even to this day, there is no legal principle that prohibits a
homeowner

or tenant from announcing that persons of a particular race
or other protected category will be systematically excluded from her home or

apartment. To that extent, a significant degree of owner
sovereignty remains immune from antidiscrimination duties.

The following case, decided before Brown v. Board of
Education declared separate-but-equal to be unconstitutional, reflects a
notable

attempt by the Supreme Court to reconcile the principle of
owner sovereignty with the goals of equal protection in the context of housing.

#### Shelley v. Kraemer

```



Supreme Court of the United States, 1948.



334 U.S. 1.



```

■ MR.
CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON delivered the opinion of the Court. These cases present
for our consideration questions relating to the validity of

court enforcement of private agreements, generally described
as restrictive covenants, which have as their purpose the exclusion of persons
of

designated race or color from the ownership or occupancy of
real property. Basic constitutional issues of obvious importance have been
raised.

The first of these cases comes to this Court on certiorari
to the Supreme Court of Missouri. On February 16, 191 1, thirty out of a total
of

thirty-nine owners of property fronting both sides of
Labadie Avenue between Taylor Avenue and Cora Avenue in the city of St. Louis,
signed an

agreement, which was subsequently recorded, providing in
part:

* * * the said property is hereby restricted to the use and
      occupancy for the term of Fifty (50) years from this date, so that * * *

hereafter no part of said property or any portion thereof
shall be, for said term of Fifty-years, occupied by any person not of the

Caucasian race, it being intended hereby to restrict the use
of said property for said period of time against the occupancy as owners or

tenants of any portion of said property for resident or
other purpose by people of the Negro or Mongolian Race.

The entire district described in the agreement included
fifty-seven parcels of land. The thirty owners who signed the agreement held
title to

forty-seven parcels, including the particular parcel
involved in this case. At the time the agreement was signed, five of the
parcels in the district

were owned by Negroes. * * *

On August 1 1, 1945, pursuant to a contract of sale,
petitioners Shelley, who are Negroes, for valuable consideration received from
one

Fitzgerald a warranty deed to the parcel in question. The
trial court

#395

found that petitioners had no actual knowledge of the
restrictive agreement at the time of the purchase.

On October 9, 1945, respondents, as owners of other property
subject to the terms of the restrictive covenant, brought suit in Circuit Court

of the city of St. Louis praying that petitioners Shelley be
restrained from taking possession of the property and that judgment be entered

divesting title out of petitioners Shelley and revesting
title in the immediate grantor or in such other person as the court should
direct. The trial

court denied the requested relief on the ground that the
restrictive agreement, upon which respondents based their action, had never
become final

and complete because it was the intention of the parties to
that agreement that it was not to become effective until signed by all property
owners

in the district, and signatures of all the owners had never
been obtained.

The Supreme Court of Missouri sitting en banc reversed and
directed the trial court to grant the relief for which respondents had prayed.

That court held the agreement effective and concluded that
enforcement of its provisions violated no rights guaranteed to petitioners by
the

Federal Constitution. At the time the court rendered its
decision, petitioners were occupying the property in question. * * *

House in Shelley v. Kraemer with Commemorative Marker

_Source_ : Saint Louis Post-Dispatch.

Petitioners have placed primary reliance on their
contentions, first raised in the state courts, that judicial enforcement of the
restrictive

agreements in these cases has violated rights guaranteed to
petitioners by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution and Acts of

#396

Congress passed pursuant to that Amendment.^4 Specifically,
petitioners urge that they have been denied the equal protection of the laws,

deprived of property without due process of law, and have
been denied privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States. We pass
to a

consideration of those issues.

I.

Whether the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment inhibits judicial enforcement by state courts of restrictive
covenants

based on race or color is a question which this Court has
not heretofore been called upon to consider. Only two cases have been decided
by this

Court which in any way have involved the enforcement of such
agreements. The first of these was the case of Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U.S.
323

(1926). There, * * * [the] only constitutional issue which
the appellants had raised in the lower courts, and hence the only
constitutional issue

before this Court on appeal, was the validity of the
covenant agreements as such. This Court concluded that since the inhibitions of
the

constitutional provisions invoked, apply only to
governmental action, as contrasted to action of private individuals, there was
no showing that the

covenants, which were simply agreements between private
property owners, were invalid. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed for want
of a

substantial question. Nothing in the opinion of this Court,
therefore, may properly be regarded as an adjudication on the merits of the

constitutional issues presented by these cases, which raise
the question of the validity, not of the private agreements as such, but of the
judicial

enforcement of those agreements.

The second of the cases involving racial restrictive
covenants was Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32 (1940). In that case, petitioners,
white

property owners, were enjoined by the state courts from
violating the terms of a restrictive agreement. The state Supreme Court had
held

petitioners bound by an earlier judicial determination, in
litigation in which petitioners were not parties, upholding the validity of the
restrictive

agreement, although, in fact, the agreement had not been
signed by the number of owners necessary to make it effective under state law.
This

Court reversed the judgment of the state Supreme Court upon
the ground that petitioners had been denied due process of law in being held

estopped to challenge the validity of the agreement on the
theory, accepted by the state court, that the earlier litigation, in which
petitioners did

not participate, was in the nature of a class suit. In
arriving at its result, this Court did not reach the issues presented by the
cases now under

consideration. * * *

#397

It cannot be doubted that among the civil rights intended to
be protected from discriminatory state action by the Fourteenth Amendment are

the rights to acquire, enjoy, own and dispose of property.
Equality in the enjoyment of property rights was regarded by the framers of
that

Amendment as an essential pre-condition to the realization
of other basic civil rights and liberties which the Amendment was intended to

guarantee. Thus, § 1978 of the Revised Statutes, derived
from § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 which was enacted by Congress while
the

Fourteenth Amendment was also under consideration, provides:

All citizens of the United States shall have the same right,
in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to

inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and
personal property.

This Court has given specific recognition to the same
principle. Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U.S. 60 (1917).

It is likewise clear that restrictions on the right of
occupancy of the sort sought to be created by the private agreements in these
cases could

not be squared with the requirements of the Fourteenth
Amendment if imposed by state statute or local ordinance. We do not understand

respondents to urge the contrary. In the case of Buchanan v.
Warley, supra, a unanimous Court declared unconstitutional the provisions of a
city

ordinance which denied to colored persons the right to
occupy houses in blocks in which the greater number of houses were occupied by
white

persons, and imposed similar restrictions on white persons
with respect to blocks in which the greater number of houses were occupied by

colored persons. During the course of the opinion in that
case, this Court stated: “The Fourteenth Amendment and these statutes enacted
in

furtherance of its purpose operate to qualify and entitle a
colored man to acquire property without state legislation discriminating
against him

solely because of color.”

In Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U.S. 668 (1927), a unanimous court,
on the authority of Buchanan v. Warley, supra, declared invalid an ordinance

which forbade any Negro to establish a home on any property
in a white community or any white person to establish a home in a Negro

community, “except on the written consent of a majority of
the persons of the opposite race inhabiting such community or portion of the
City to

be affected.”

The precise question before this Court in both the Buchanan
and Harmon cases, involved the rights of white sellers to dispose of their

properties free from restrictions as to potential purchasers
based on considerations of race or color. But that such legislation is also
offensive to

the rights of those desiring to acquire and occupy property
and barred on grounds of race or color, is clear * * * from the language of the
opinion

in Buchanan v. Warley, supra. * * *

#398

But the present cases, unlike those just discussed, do not
involve action by state legislatures or city councils. Here the particular
patterns of

discrimination and the areas in which the restrictions are
to operate, are determined, in the first instance, by the terms of agreements
among

private individuals. Participation of the State consists in
the enforcement of the restrictions so defined. The crucial issue with which we
are here

confronted is whether this distinction removes these cases
from the operation of the prohibitory provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Since the decision of this Court in the Civil Rights Cases,
109 U.S. 3 (1883), the principle has become firmly embedded in our

constitutional law that the action inhibited by the first
section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said
to be that of

the States. That Amendment erects no shield against merely
private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful.

We conclude, therefore, that the restrictive agreements
standing alone cannot be regarded as a violation of any rights guaranteed to

petitioners by the Fourteenth Amendment. So long as the
purposes of those agreements are effectuated by voluntary adherence to their
terms, it

would appear clear that there has been no action by the
State and the provisions of the Amendment have not been violated. Cf. Corrigan
v.

Buckley, supra.

But here there was more. These are cases in which the
purposes of the agreements were secured only by judicial enforcement by state
courts

of the restrictive terms of the agreements. The respondents
urge that judicial enforcement of private agreements does not amount to state
action;

or, in any event, the participation of the State is so
attenuated in character as not to amount to state action within the meaning of
the Fourteenth

Amendment. Finally, it is suggested, even if the States in
these cases may be deemed to have acted in the constitutional sense, their
action did not

deprive petitioners of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth
Amendment. We move to a consideration of these matters.

II.

That the action of state courts and of judicial officers in
their official capacities is to be regarded as action of the State within the
meaning of

the Fourteenth Amendment, is a proposition which has long
been established by decisions of this Court. * * *

One of the earliest applications of the prohibitions
contained in the Fourteenth Amendment to action of state judicial officials
occurred in

cases in which Negroes had been excluded from jury service
in criminal prosecutions by reason of their race or color. These cases
demonstrate,

also, the early recognition by this Court that state action
in violation of the Amendment’s provisions is equally repugnant to the
constitutional

commands whether directed by state statute or taken by a
judicial official in the absence of statute. Thus, in Strauder v. West
Virginia, 100 U.S.

303 (1880), this Court declared invalid a state statute
restricting jury

#399

service to white persons as amounting to a denial of the
equal protection of the laws to the colored defendant in that case. In the same
volume of

the reports, the Court in Ex parte Commonwealth of Virginia,
100 U.S. 339 (1879), held that a similar discrimination imposed by the action
of a

state judge denied rights protected by the Amendment,
despite the fact that the language of the state statute relating to jury
service contained no

such restrictions. * * *

But the examples of state judicial action which have been
held by this Court to violate the Amendment’s commands are not restricted to

situations in which the judicial proceedings were found in
some manner to be procedurally unfair. It has been recognized that the action
of state

courts in enforcing a substantive common-law rule formulated
by those courts, may result in the denial of rights guaranteed by the
Fourteenth

Amendment, even though the judicial proceedings in such
cases may have been in complete accord with the most rigorous conceptions of

procedural due process. Thus, in American Federation of
Labor v. Swing, 312 U.S. 321 (1941), enforcement by state courts of the
common-law

policy of the State, which resulted in the restraining of
peaceful picketing, was held to be state action of the sort prohibited by the
Amendment’s

guaranties of freedom of discussion. In Cantwell v.
Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296 (1940), a conviction in a state court of the
common-law crime of

breach of the peace was, under the circumstances of the
case, found to be a violation of the Amendment’s commands relating to freedom
of

religion. In Bridges v. California, 314 U.S. 252 (1941),
enforcement of the state’s common-law rule relating to contempts by publication
was

held to be state action inconsistent with the prohibitions
of the Fourteenth Amendment. * * *

III.

Against this background of judicial construction, extending
over a period of some three-quarters of a century, we are called upon to
consider

whether enforcement by state courts of the restrictive
agreements in these cases may be deemed to be the acts of those States; and, if
so, whether

that action has denied these petitioners the equal
protection of the laws which the Amendment was intended to insure.

We have no doubt that there has been state action in these
cases in the full and complete sense of the phrase. The undisputed facts
disclose

that petitioners were willing purchasers of properties upon
which they desired to establish homes. The owners of the properties were
willing

sellers; and contracts of sale were accordingly consummated.
It is clear that but for the active intervention of the state courts, supported
by the

full panoply of state power, petitioners would have been
free to occupy the properties in question without restraint.

These are not cases, as has been suggested, in which the
States have merely abstained from action, leaving private individuals free to

impose such discriminations as they see fit. Rather, these
are cases in which the States have made available to such individuals the full
coercive

power of

#400

government to deny to petitioners, on the grounds of race or
color, the enjoyment of property rights in premises which petitioners are
willing and

financially able to acquire and which the grantors are
willing to sell. The difference between judicial enforcement and nonenforcement
of the

restrictive covenants is the difference to petitioners
between being denied rights of property available to other members of the
community and

being accorded full enjoyment of those rights on an equal
footing.

The enforcement of the restrictive agreements by the state
courts in these cases was directed pursuant to the common-law policy of the

States as formulated by those courts in earlier decisions. *

* * State action, as that phrase is understood for the purposes of the
    Fourteenth

Amendment, refers to exertions of state power in all forms.
And when the effect of that action is to deny rights subject to the protection
of the

Fourteenth Amendment, it is the obligation of this Court to
enforce the constitutional commands.

We hold that in granting judicial enforcement of the
restrictive agreements in these cases, the States have denied petitioners the
equal

protection of the laws and that, therefore, the action of
the state courts cannot stand. We have noted that freedom from discrimination
by the

States in the enjoyment of property rights was among the
basic objectives sought to be effectuated by the framers of the Fourteenth
Amendment.

That such discrimination has occurred in these cases is
clear. Because of the race or color of these petitioners they have been denied
rights of

ownership or occupancy enjoyed as a matter of course by
other citizens of different race or color. * * *^26

Respondents urge, however, that since the state courts stand
ready to enforce restrictive covenants excluding white persons from the

ownership or occupancy of property covered by such
agreements, enforcement of covenants excluding colored persons may not be
deemed a

denial of equal protection of the laws to the colored
persons who are thereby affected. This contention does not bear scrutiny. The
parties have

directed our attention to no case in which a court, state or
federal, has been called upon to enforce a covenant excluding members of the
white

majority from ownership or occupancy of real property on
grounds of race or color. But there are more fundamental considerations. The
rights

created by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment
are, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual. The rights established are
personal

rights. It is, therefore, no answer to these petitioners to
say that the courts may also be induced to deny white persons rights of
ownership and

occupancy on grounds of race or color. Equal protection of
the laws is not achieved through indiscriminate imposition of inequalities.

#401

Nor do we find merit in the suggestion that property owners
who are parties to these agreements are denied equal protection of the laws if

denied access to the courts to enforce the terms of
restrictive covenants and to assert property rights which the state courts have
held to be created

by such agreements. The Constitution confers upon no
individual the right to demand action by the State which results in the denial
of equal

protection of the laws to other individuals. And it would
appear beyond question that the power of the State to create and enforce
property

interests must be exercised within the boundaries defined by
the Fourteenth Amendment. Cf. Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501 (1946). * * *

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Missouri * * * must be reversed.

■ MR.
JUSTICE REED, MR. JUSTICE JACKSON, and MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE took no part in the
consideration or decision of these cases.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .For further background on _Shelley_ , see Carol Rose,
Property Stories: _Shelley v. Kraemer_ , in Property Stories 189 (Gerald
Korngold & Andrew P.

Morriss eds., 2 d ed. 2009 ); see also Richard R.W. Brooks
& Carol M. Rose, Saving the Neighborhood: Racially Restrictive Covenants,
Law, and Social

Norms ( 2013 ); Clement E. Vose, Caucasians Only: The
Supreme Court, the NAACP, and the Restrictive Covenant Cases ( 1959 ). A few
years after the

decision in _Shelley_ , the Court ruled that judicial
judgments awarding damages for breach of a racial covenant are also state
action forbidden under the

Equal Protection Clause. Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249 (
1953 ). This eliminated the possible argument that the prohibitory nature of a
judicial

injunction makes this type of judicial judgment “state
action,” whereas other types of judicial action such as awarding damages for
breach of contract or

enforcing a racially discriminatory bequest in a will, are
not.

2 .We have seen a number of devices or ideas for drawing the
line between the sphere of owner sovereignty and the sphere of collective or
public

sovereignty, including common-law restrictions (e.g., the
defense of necessity), custom (e.g., hunting rights), and public accommodations
requirements.

_Shelley_ calls upon yet another device: the state action
doctrine. _Shelley_ says that a mere “voluntary agreement” among neighbors not
to sell to African-

Americans would not be state action, and hence is a
permissible incidence of owner sovereignty. But if someone calls upon the
powers of the courts to

enforce such an agreement, any resulting judicial judgment
is state action, and hence is subject to the limitations of the Constitution,
including the Equal

Protection Clause. Recall too that in the context of
attempts to recover personal property, the Supreme Court has held that replevin
actions and judicial

garnishment orders are state action, and hence are subject
to the constitutional requirements of the Due Process Clause—but courts have
generally

assumed that self-help repossessions are not state action,
and hence escape due process limitations. Does this suggest

```



402



```

that the sphere of owner sovereignty is limited to efforts
to exclude others through informal persuasion based on norms and customs,
voluntary

compliance with contracts, and self-help? Does this mean
that any attempt to invoke the private law of property in a court is
automatically transformed

into a species of federal constitutional law? Or does this
result in too small a sphere for owner sovereignty relative to public
sovereignty?

3 .Most (but not all) commentators have concluded that
_Shelley_ was correctly decided, but they have also been reluctant to endorse
the idea that

any judicial enforcement of property rights is subject to
the various constitutional limitations that apply to government action more
generally. Such an

understanding might mean, for example, that calling the
police to remove a house guest because you find her speech offensive might be
subject to

challenge under the First Amendment. Trying to identify some
limiting principle for _Shelley_ ’s conclusion that judicial enforcement of
racial covenants is

state action has nevertheless vexed scholars ever since the
decision was handed down. See, e.g., Louis Pollak, Racial Discrimination and
Judicial

Integrity: A Reply to Professor Wechsler, 108 U. Pa. L. Rev.
1 ( 1959 ) ( _Shelley_ correctly decided because judicial enforcement of the
covenant required a

person who did not wish to discriminate to engage in
discriminatory action); Thomas P. Lewis, The Meaning of State Action, 60 Colum.
L. Rev. 1083 ,

1115 ( 1960 ) ( _Shelley_ correctly decided because racial
covenants are functionally equivalent to zoning laws); Louis Henkin, _Shelley
v. Kraemer_ : Notes

for a Revised Opinion, 110 U. Pa. L. Rev. 473 ( 1962 ) (
_Shelley_ justified under a balancing test that compares impact of
discrimination on blacks against

liberty interest of white property owners); Robert J.
Glennon & John E. Nowak, A Functional Analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment
“State Action”

Requirement, 1976 Sup. Ct. Rev. 221 ( _Shelley_ properly
separated out for invalidation those nongovernmental activities whose existence
impairs

fundamental constitutional values); Laurence H. Tribe,
Constitutional Choices 260 ( 1985 ) ( _Shelley_ correctly decided because
enforcement of the

covenant was an exception to the general rule followed by
the state of prohibiting restraints on alienation); Mark D. Rosen, Was _Shelley
v. Kraemer_

Incorrectly Decided? Some New Answers, 95 Cal. L. Rev. 451 (
2007 ) ( _Shelley_ correctly decided but should have been grounded in the
Thirteenth

Amendment and statutes implementing it rather than the
Fourteenth Amendment); but see Lillian BeVier and John Harrison, The State
Action Principle

and Its Critics, 96 Va. L. Rev. 1767 , 1798 – 1802 ( 2010 )
(discussing how _Shelley_ is in tension with the general understanding that
constitutional

restrictions apply to agents of the people but not to the
people themselves).

4 .One related but distinct approach to the specter of
racially restrictive covenants is to invalidate them on grounds of public
policy. For example,

in the case of _Re Drummond Wren_ , [ 1945 ] O.R. 778 , 4
D.L.R. 674 , the Ontario High Court held that a covenant prohibiting sale of
real estate to “Jews

or persons of objectionable nationality” was void as against
public policy. Courts have traditionally exercised a common-law power to
invalidate

contracts on grounds of public policy. Indeed, the Supreme
Court held, immediately after the decision in _Shelley_ , that judicial
enforcement of racial

#403

covenants in Washington, D.C. would violate public policy.
Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U.S. 24 , 34 – 35 ( 1948 ). Why didn’t the Court take the
same tack in

_Shelley_ itself? What is the source of law for covenants in
Missouri? Might the Supreme Court in _Shelley_ have decided that the _failure_
of the state courts

to apply the public policy exception to racial covenants,
when other types of covenants remote from land use regulation are invalidated
on these

grounds, was the “state action” (or inaction) that violated
the federal Constitution?

Use of Trespass Actions to Exclude Persons Based on Race

Shelley v. Kraemer holds that judicial enforcement of a
racial covenant to block the sale of a home from a willing seller to a willing
African-

American buyer is “state action,” and hence violates the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. What then about judicial

enforcement of trespass law at the behest of a property
owner to block an African-American from entering property, in circumstances
where the

owner permits entry by whites? In other words, does Shelley
require that any state enforcement of private property rights is “state action”
subject

to the constitutional limitations that apply to government,
at least when the enforcement action is motivated by racial animus? This issue
came to

the fore during the civil rights movement of the early
1960s. African-American demonstrators staged numerous sit-ins at segregated
lunch

counters, restaurants, and public transportation systems, in
order to dramatize the injustice of racial segregation at these establishments.
White

owners, in response, would often call the police to have the
demonstrators arrested for trespassing.

In states where segregation was required by law, the Supreme
Court held that prosecutions for criminal trespass were state action, without

regard to whether the owner’s action in calling the police
was motivated by a desire to comply with the law or by personal prejudice.
Peterson v.

Greenville, 373 U.S. 244 (1963). Justice Harlan, concurring
in the judgment, thought that state action could be found only where there was

individualized proof that the owner was motivated by a
desire to comply with the statute. Id. at 252–53. But what if there were no
state or local

statute requiring segregation, and blacks were excluded from
the restaurant or lunch counter because of the personal prejudice of the owner,
or

because the owner imagined that this was what a majority of
his customers wanted?

A number of cases fitting the latter pattern reached the
Supreme Court in Bell v. Maryland , 378 U.S. 226 (1964). One of the arguments

advanced by the demonstrators was that their convictions for
trespass were unconstitutional under Shelley v. Kraemer. They argued that
allowing

a restaurant owner who wants to discriminate against blacks
to call upon the police and courts to enforce these preferences transforms
private

discriminatory animus into state action, and is forbidden by
the Fourteenth Amendment.

#404

The Court ducked the state action question presented. The
lead case involved a sit-in at a restaurant in Baltimore, Maryland. Shortly
after

the Court granted review, Maryland enacted a statute making
racial segregation in public accommodations, including restaurants, unlawful.
The

majority vacated and remanded for the Maryland courts to
determine whether this development would mean that the state courts would
“abate”

the convictions.

Justice Hugo Black, a former Alabama Senator named to the
Court by Franklin Roosevelt, filed a vigorous dissent, joined by Justices

Harlan and White. Black struggled without notable success to
distinguish Shelley v. Kraemer. But he wrote at a time when mounting civil

disturbances over race relations had given rise in many
quarters to concern about a breakdown in law and order. Black defended trespass
law as a

necessary ingredient in the maintenance of social order:

The experience of ages points to the inexorable fact that
people are frequently stirred to violence when property which the law

recognizes as theirs is forcibly invaded or occupied by
others. Trespass laws are born of this experience. They have been, and

doubtless still are, important features of any government
dedicated, as this country is, to a rule of law. Whatever power it may allow

the States or grant to the Congress to regulate the use of
private property, the Constitution does not confer upon any group the right to

substitute rule by force for rule by law. Force leads to
violence, violence to mob conflicts, and these to rule by the strongest groups

with control of the most deadly weapons. Our Constitution,
noble work of wise men, was designed—all of it—to chart a quite different

course: to “establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility *

* * and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.” At

times the rule of law seems too slow to some for the
settlement of their grievances. But it is the plan our Nation has chosen to
preserve

both “Liberty” and equality for all. On that plan we have
put our trust and staked our future. This constitutional rule of law has served

us well. Maryland’s trespass law does not depart from it.
Nor shall we.

Id. at 346.

Justice Arthur Goldberg, joined by Chief Justice Warren and
Justice Douglas, wrote a response to Justice Black’s dissent, arguing that the

convictions for trespass would have violated the Fourteenth
Amendment, provided the state had not amended its law to prohibit segregation
in

public accommodations. Justice Goldberg did not endorse the
theory that the trespass convictions were state action under Shelley v.
Kraemer.

Instead, he advanced an historical argument to the effect
that the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment intended to constitutionalize
common-

law rights of equal access to inns and common carriers as
part of the civil rights enjoyed by all persons. These rights, he further
argued,

#405

were inconsistent with discrimination by innkeepers or
common carriers based on race. Finally, he maintained that these civil rights,
as

reasonably extrapolated to modern conditions, were broad
enough to cover discrimination by restaurants and lunch counters. One virtue
Justice

Goldberg saw in this alternative theory was that it did not
threaten to transform all judicial enforcement of trespass law into state
action. His

theory only proscribed judicial enforcement of trespass law
that would deny African-Americans equal access to public accommodations. Id. at

288–312.

As it turned out, the Court never resolved the question
whether enforcement of trespass law motivated by racial prejudice is state
action.

Shortly after Bell v. Maryland was decided, Congress passed
the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title II of that Act prohibited racial

discrimination in any public accommodation affected by
interstate commerce. 42 U.S.C. § 2000a. The Court quickly held that the Act
abated

convictions of sit-in protesters under state trespass law.
See Jack Greenberg, The Supreme Court, Civil Rights and Civil Dissonance, 77
Yale L.J.

1520, 1532 (1968). The Act effectively ended the era of
racial segregation in public accommodations broadly defined, including
restaurants,

lunch counters, hotels, and common carriers. The fact that
the Court had ducked the question whether enforcement of trespass law is state
action,

without more, meant that owners of property not open to the
public can continue to call upon the power of the state to enforce their right
to

exclude, even when that right is exercised in a
discriminatory manner.

A postscript: The named plaintiff in Bell v. Maryland was a
high school student when he participated in the sit-in at the Baltimore

restaurant. He later went on to college and law school.
Eventually, he became the Chief Judge of the Maryland Court of Appeals. (Thanks
to the

late Jack Greenberg, who argued Bell v. Maryland in the U.S.
Supreme Court, for supplying this information.)

The Fair Housing Act

Congress soon enacted another major piece of civil rights
legislation: the Fair Housing Act, as Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of
1968 is

usually known. After declaring “the policy of the United
States [to be] to provide within constitutional limitations for fair housing
throughout the

United States,” § 3601, the FHA goes on to prohibit a range
of discriminatory behaviors against members of enumerated protected classes in
the

housing field, with certain exceptions. Over the years the
FHA has been amended to add protected classes such as the disabled. Consider
the

following selected provisions of the FHA.

granted by this subsection shall apply only with respect to
one such sale within any twenty-four month period: Provided further , That such
bona

nor is there owned or reserved on his behalf, under any express or voluntary

agreement, title to or any right to all or a portion of the
proceeds from the sale or rental of, more than three such single-family houses
at any one

application of

this subchapter only if such house is sold or rented (A)
without the use in any manner of the sales or rental facilities or the sales or
rental services

of any real estate broker, agent, or salesman, or of such
facilities or services of any person in the business of selling or renting
dwellings, or of

any employee or agent of any such broker, agent, salesman,
or person and (B) without the publication, posting or mailing, after notice, of
any

advertisement or written notice in violation of section
3604(c) of this title; but nothing in this proviso shall prohibit the use of
attorneys, escrow

agents, abstractors, title companies, and other such
professional assistance as necessary to perfect or transfer the title, or

(2)rooms or units in dwellings containing living quarters
occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than four families living

independently of each other, if the owner actually maintains
and occupies one of such living quarters as his residence.

§ 3607.Religious organization or private club exemption

(a)Nothing in this subchapter shall prohibit a religious
organization, association, or society, or any nonprofit institution or
organization

operated, supervised or controlled by or in conjunction with
a religious organization, association, or society, from limiting the sale,
rental or

occupancy of dwellings which it owns or operates for other
than a commercial purpose to persons of the same religion, or from giving
preference

to such persons, unless membership in such religion is
restricted on account of race, color, or national origin. Nor shall anything in
this

subchapter prohibit a private club not in fact open to the
public, which as an incident to its primary purpose or purposes provides
lodgings which

it owns or operates for other than a commercial purpose,
from limiting the rental or occupancy of such lodgings to its members or from
giving

preference to its members.

(b)(1)Nothing in this subchapter limits the applicability of
any reasonable local, State, or Federal restrictions regarding the maximum

number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling. Nor does
any provision in this subchapter regarding familial status apply with respect
to

housing for older persons. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Suppose an owner denies a single mother with children an
apartment and says that he thinks children are too noisy. Does this violate the
FHA?

What if the discrimination is more subtle? The Supreme Court
has recently held that plaintiffs under the FHA need not always show
discriminatory

intent; namely, discriminatory impact claims are also
cognizable under the FHA. Texas Dept. of Housing & Community Affairs v. The
Inclusive

Communities Project, Inc., 576 U.S. 519 ( 2015 ). Justice
Kennedy, writing for the majority, noted that disparate impact liability would
counteract

discriminatory zoning and other systematic exclusion of
minorities and was a way of getting at hidden discriminatory intent. To avoid
constitutional

issues, the opinion goes on to enumerate ways defendants can
meet the burden of justifying a policy, such as traffic patterns and historic
preservation,

and it expresses a preference for race-neutral methods of
avoiding disparate impact. Dissents by Justices Alito and Thomas took issue
with the

majority’s invocation of the purpose of the FHA (rather than
the text) and developments after the passage of the Act. Should the same
standard apply to

local governments and to private actors? We return to some
of these issues in the materials on exclusionary zoning in Chapter IX.

2 .Section 3603 (b)( 2 ) of the FHA is known as the “Mrs.
Murphy” exception (presumably the name itself being an example of
stereotyping), and is

aimed at protecting the associational interests of a
landlord living on the premises with three or fewer other apartments. Note that
the exception does not

apply to advertising. If a live-in owner in a building with
four units refuses to rent to a single mother with a young child, is there a
violation of the FHA?

Suppose the owner places the following advertisement in a
newspaper: “For rent: Furnished apartment. No children allowed.” Then a single
mother with

two children applies and is rejected.

3 .What if the landlord places an advertisement saying that
the premises would be “rented only to persons speaking Polish, German, or
Swedish”?

In one case, such an ad was found impermissibly to reflect a
preference for certain nationalities even though the landlord contended that it
fostered

communication. See Holmgren v. Little Village Community
Reporter, 342 F. Supp. 512 (N.D. Ill. 1971 ). Publications are potentially
liable for carrying

discriminatory advertisements, including those showing only
white models in their pictures in such a way as to indicate a racial
preference. In _Ragin v.

New York Times Co._ , 923 F. 2 d 995 ( 2 d Cir. 1991 ), this
type of liability under the FHA was held not to violate the First Amendment.
What about a recent

Korean immigrant landlord who advertises in Korean in a
Korean-language newspaper in Los Angeles (but with no stated preference as to
type of

tenant)? Is there potential liability?

```

4 .At the time the FHA was passed, the predominant vision of
antidiscrimination law was an integrationist one, although the statute is
framed in

terms of individual rights. What if racial quotas are used
to maintain integration? In the most famous such situation, Starrett City, a
housing development

in Brooklyn, used quotas to maintain a strict balance
between blacks, Latinos, and whites. In the process black and Latino
prospective tenants were

turned away from apartments that were later rented to
whites. Over a dissent by Judge Newman, the court held that racial ceiling
quotas violated the

FHA despite the owners’ claim that they were being used to
maintain integration and prevent “white flight.” United States v. Starrett City
Associates,

840 F. 2 d 1096 ( 2 d Cir. 1988 ).

5 .It is important to remember that the Fair Housing Act is
not the only antidiscrimination law that might apply to a given discriminatory
act in the

housing area. Notably, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 provides
that “[a]ll citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every
State and

Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to
inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.”
42 U.S.C. § 1982. This

applies to race only, but the Supreme Court has held that
the notion of race here is the very broad one prevailing at the time the Act
was passed. See

Shaare Tefila Congregation v. Cobb, 481 U.S. 615 , 617 (
1987 ) (holding that with Civil Rights Act of 1866 Congress “intended to
protect from

discrimination identifiable classes of persons who are
subjected to intentional discrimination solely because of their ancestry or
ethnic characteristics”

and that Jews are part of protected class) (quotation marks
omitted). Based on contemporary Congressional debates, the Court has said that
Section 1982

would include groups like Arabs, Chinese, Germans, and
Anglo-Saxons. See Saint Francis College v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604 , 612 (
1987 ). Also,

Section 1982 contains no exceptions like those for small
landlords and religious organizations in the FHA.

6 .The Fair Housing Act does not explicitly ban
discrimination based on sexual orientation or transgender status and was long
thought not to cover

individuals in these categories. But in Bostock v. Clayton
County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 ( 2020 ), the Supreme Court held that the language in
Title VII of the

Civil Rights Act prohibiting discrimination in employment
“because... of sex” logically compels the conclusion that discrimination based
on sexual

orientation or transgender status is covered by Title VII.
Given the parallel language in the FHA, see § 3604 supra, it is likely that a
similar conclusion

will be reached regarding the coverage of the FHA. For a
decision anticipating such a result, see Smith v. Avanti, 249 F. Supp. 3 d 1194
, 1202 – 03 (D.

Colo. 2017 ) (interpreting similar language in the Colorado
housing discrimination law).

7 .Consider the impact of the internet on Section 3604 (c)’s
ban on discriminatory advertising. If someone posts an ad on a website for the
rental of

a “whites only” apartment, is the website in violation of
the statute? You might think so. But in 1996 Congress enacted the
Communications Decency

Act, which includes a provision granting immunity from
liability to online publishers for the content of user-generated material that
appears on their

website. 47 U.S.C. § 230 (c)( 1 ) ( 2006 ). The Seventh
Circuit has held that

```



410



```

craigslist.com is immune from liability for discriminatory
ads as long as the website does nothing that “induces anyone to post any
particular listing or

express a preference for discrimination.” Chicago Lawyers’
Comm. for Civil Rights Under the Law, Inc. v. Craigslist, Inc., 519 F. 3 d 666
, 671 ( 7 th Cir.

2008 ). Because of the immunity created by the
Communications Decency Act (and the difficulty of bringing enforcement actions
against large numbers

of individuals), a recent article reports that violations of
the FHA are rampant on craigslist.com—“roughly several hundred on any given
day.” Rigel C.

Oliveri, Discriminatory Housing Advertisements On-line:
Lessons from Craigslist, 43 Ind. L. Rev. 1125 , 1127 ( 2010 ). In contrast, the
Ninth Circuit held

that roommate.com could be sued under the FHA,
notwithstanding the Communications Decency Act immunity, because the site
helped “develop” the

content by asking users to create a profile that included
characteristics like their sex and sexual orientation (discrimination on this
latter basis being

prohibited under local law) that was then used to match the
user with others with those characteristics. Fair Housing Council of San
Fernando Valley v.

Roommates.Com, LLC, 521 F. 3 d 1157 , 1166 ( 9 th Cir. 2008
) (en banc). This then required the court to consider whether discrimination in
the choice of

roommates is in fact prohibited by the FHA.

■
KOZINSKI, CHIEF JUDGE. There’s no place like home. In the privacy of your own
home, you can take off your coat, kick off your shoes, let your

guard down and be completely yourself. While we usually
share our homes only with friends and family, sometimes we need to take in a
stranger

to help pay the rent. When that happens, can the government
limit whom we choose? Specifically, do the anti-discrimination provisions of
the

Fair Housing Act (“FHA”) extend to the selection of
roommates?

FACTS

Roommate.com, LLC (“Roommate”) operates an internet-based
business that helps roommates find each other. Roommate’s website

receives over 40,000 visits a day and roughly a million new
postings for roommates are created each year. When users sign up, they must
create a

profile by answering a series of questions about their sex,
sexual orientation and whether children will be living with them. An open-ended

“Additional Comments” section lets users include information
not prompted by the questionnaire. Users are asked to list their preferences
for

roommate characteristics, including sex, sexual orientation
and familial status. Based on the profiles and preferences, Roommate matches
users

and provides them a list of housing-seekers or available
rooms meeting their criteria. Users can also search available listings

#411

based on roommate characteristics, including sex, sexual
orientation and familial status.

The Fair Housing Councils of San Fernando Valley and San
Diego (“FHCs”) sued Roommate in federal court, alleging that the website’s

questions requiring disclosure of sex, sexual orientation
and familial status, and its sorting, steering and matching of users based on
those

characteristics, violate the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), 42
U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. * * *

ANALYSIS

If the FHA extends to shared living situations, it’s quite
clear that what Roommate does amounts to a violation. The pivotal question is

whether the FHA applies to roommates.

I

The FHA prohibits discrimination on the basis of “race,
color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin” in the “sale or
rental of a

dwelling. ” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b) (emphasis added). The FHA
also makes it illegal to

make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or
published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or

rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference,
limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap,
familial

status, or national origin, or an intention to make any such
preference, limitation, or discrimination.

Id. § 3604(c) (emphasis added). The reach of the statute
turns on the meaning of “dwelling.”

The FHA defines “dwelling” as “any building, structure, or
portion thereof which is occupied as, or designed or intended for occupancy as,

a residence by one or more families.” Id. § 3602(b). A
dwelling is thus a living unit designed or intended for occupancy by a family,
meaning

that it ordinarily has the elements generally associated
with a family residence: sleeping spaces, bathroom and kitchen facilities, and
common

areas, such as living rooms, dens and hallways.

It would be difficult, though not impossible, to divide a
single-family house or apartment into separate “dwellings” for purposes of the

statute. Is a “dwelling” a bedroom plus a right to access
common areas? What if roommates share a bedroom? Could a “dwelling” be a bottom

bunk and half an armoire? It makes practical sense to
interpret “dwelling” as an independent living unit and stop the FHA at the
front door.

There’s no indication that Congress intended to interfere
with personal relationships inside the home. Congress wanted to address the

problem of landlords discriminating in the sale and rental
of housing, which deprived protected classes of housing opportunities. But a
business

transaction between a tenant and landlord is quite different
from an arrangement between two people sharing the same living space. We

#412

seriously doubt Congress meant the FHA to apply to the
latter. Consider, for example, the FHA’s prohibition against sex
discrimination. Could

Congress, in the 1960s, really have meant that women must
accept men as roommates? Telling women they may not lawfully exclude men from

the list of acceptable roommates would be controversial
today; it would have been scandalous in the 1960s.

While it’s possible to read dwelling to mean sub-parts of a
home or an apartment, doing so leads to awkward results. And applying the FHA

to the selection of roommates almost certainly leads to
results that defy mores prevalent when the statute was passed. Nonetheless,
this

interpretation is not wholly implausible and we would
normally consider adopting it, given that the FHA is a remedial statute that we
construe

broadly. Therefore, we turn to constitutional concerns,
which provide strong countervailing considerations.

II

The Supreme Court has recognized that “the freedom to enter
into and carry on certain intimate or private relationships is a fundamental

element of liberty protected by the Bill of Rights.” Bd. of
Dirs. of Rotary Int’l v. Rotary Club of Duarte , 481 U.S. 537, 545 (1987).
“[C]hoices to

enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships
must be secured against undue intrusion by the State because of the role of
such

relationships in safeguarding the individual freedom that is
central to our constitutional scheme.” Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609,
617–18

(1984). Courts have extended the right of intimate
association to marriage, child bearing, child rearing and cohabitation with
relatives. Id. While

the right protects only “highly personal relationships,” the
right isn’t restricted exclusively to family. The right to association also
implies a right

not to associate.

To determine whether a particular relationship is protected
by the right to intimate association we look to “size, purpose, selectivity,
and

whether others are excluded from critical aspects of the
relationship.” Bd. of Dirs. of Rotary Int’l, 481 U.S. at 546. The roommate
relationship

easily qualifies: People generally have very few roommates;
they are selective in choosing roommates; and non-roommates are excluded from

the critical aspects of the relationship, such as using the
living spaces. Aside from immediate family or a romantic partner, it’s hard to
imagine a

relationship more intimate than that between roommates, who
share living rooms, dining rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, even bedrooms.

Because of a roommate’s unfettered access to the home,
choosing a roommate implicates significant privacy and safety considerations.
The

home is the center of our private lives. Roommates note our
comings and goings, observe whom we bring back at night, hear what songs we
sing

in the shower, see us in various stages of undress and learn
intimate details most of us prefer to keep private. Roommates also have access
to our

physical belongings and to our person. As the Supreme Court
recognized, “[w]e are at our most vulnerable when we are asleep because

#413

we cannot monitor our own safety or the security of our
belongings.” Minnesota v. Olson , 495 U.S. 9 1, 99 (1990). Taking on a roommate
means

giving him full access to the space where we are most
vulnerable.

Equally important, we are fully exposed to a roommate’s
belongings, activities, habits, proclivities and way of life. This could
include

matter we find offensive (pornography, religious materials,
political propaganda); dangerous (tobacco, drugs, firearms); annoying (jazz,
perfume,

frequent overnight visitors, furry pets); habits that are
incompatible with our lifestyle (early risers, messy cooks, bathroom hogs,
clothing

borrowers). When you invite others to share your living
quarters, you risk becoming a suspect in whatever illegal activities they
engage in.

Government regulation of an individual’s ability to pick a
roommate thus intrudes into the home, which “is entitled to special protection
as

the center of the private lives of our people.” Minnesota v.
Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 99 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring). “Liberty protects the
person

from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or
other private places. In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the
home.”

Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 562 (2003). Holding that
the FHA applies inside a home or apartment would allow the government to
restrict

our ability to choose roommates compatible with our
lifestyles. This would be a serious invasion of privacy, autonomy and security.

For example, women will often look for female roommates
because of modesty or security concerns. As roommates often share bathrooms

and common areas, a girl may not want to walk around in her
towel in front of a boy. She might also worry about unwanted sexual advances or

becoming romantically involved with someone she must count
on to pay the rent.

An orthodox Jew may want a roommate with similar beliefs and
dietary restrictions, so he won’t have to worry about finding honey-baked

ham in the refrigerator next to the potato latkes.
Non-Jewish roommates may not understand or faithfully follow all of the
culinary rules, like the

use of different silverware for dairy and meat products, or
the prohibition against warming non-kosher food in a kosher microwave. Taking
away

the ability to choose roommates with similar dietary
restrictions and religious convictions will substantially burden the observant
Jew’s ability to

live his life and practice his religion faithfully. The same
is true of individuals of other faiths that call for dietary restrictions or
rituals inside the

home.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
recently dismissed a complaint against a young woman for advertising, “I am

looking for a female christian roommate,” on her church
bulletin board. In its Determination of No Reasonable Cause, HUD explained that
“in

light of the facts provided and after assessing the unique
context of the advertisement and the roommate relationship involved... the
Department

defers to Constitutional considerations in reaching its

#414

conclusions.” Fair Hous. Ctr. of W. Mich. v. Tricia, No.
05–10–1738–8 (Oct. 28, 2010) (Determination of No Reasonable Cause).

It’s a “well-established principle that statutes will be
interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties.” Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S.
474, 483

(1988). “[W]here an otherwise acceptable construction of a
statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe
the statute

to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly
contrary to the intent of Congress.” Pub. Citizen v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 491
U.S.

440, 466 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). * * *
Reading “dwelling” to mean an independent housing unit is a fair interpretation
of the

text and consistent with congressional intent. Because the
construction of “dwelling” to include shared living units raises substantial

constitutional concerns, we adopt the narrower construction
that excludes roommate selection from the reach of the FHA. * * *

Because precluding individuals from selecting roommates
based on their sex, sexual orientation and familial status raises substantial

constitutional concerns, we interpret the FHA * * * as not
applying to the sharing of living units. Therefore, we hold that Roommate’s

prompting, sorting and publishing of information to
facilitate roommate selection is not forbidden by the FHA * * *. Accordingly,
we vacate the

district court’s judgment and remand for entry of judgment
for defendant. Because the [Fair Housing Councils] are no longer prevailing, we

vacate the district court’s order for attorney’s fees and
dismiss the cross-appeals on attorney’s fees as moot.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Laws that prohibit discrimination in private (i.e.,
non-governmental) housing markets can be said to have three objectives or
purposes. First,

they are designed to increase housing opportunities for
persons in the protected classes. If landlords and sellers are free to
discriminate based on race, for

example, African-Americans and members of other racial
minority groups may find that many of the better-maintained units in more
sought-after

neighborhoods are foreclosed to them, without regard to
their ability to pay. Prohibiting discrimination opens up these additional
housing opportunities

to members of protected groups. Second, such laws are
designed to eliminate the personal harm or indignity suffered by members of
protected groups

when they are rejected by a landlord or seller on the ground
of their status as a member of the group. Third, these laws are designed to
eliminate a social

message of inferiority or subordination that is communicated
to the community at large when landlords and sellers are permitted to
discriminate against

persons based on their membership in protected groups. Which
of the forgoing three purposes is most implicated in the FHA’s advertising ban?
Is the

context of sharing with roommates different?

```



2 .Prior to the enactment of the Fair Housing Act in 1968 ,
regulation of discrimination in housing markets was left largely to state and
local



```

```



415



```

governments. This resulted in considerable variation in
antidiscrimination law, enforcement practices, and social norms from one part
of the country to

another. The 1968 Act represented a major shift in
antidiscrimination efforts to the federal level. This meant a movement toward
greater uniformity

throughout the country in terms of laws, enforcement, and
(presumably at least to a degree) social norms. Recent years have seen at least
a partial shift

back toward more variety in laws and interpretations of laws
among states and local governmental units. The opinion in the _Roommate.com_
case dealt

also with a California statute, treating it in parallel
fashion to the FHA (over a dissent on this point). States also differ in the
degree to which they have

enacted a standard for protecting religious liberty that is
stronger than under current federal constitutional case law. See, e.g.,
Attorney General v.

Desilets, 636 N.E. 2 d 233 (Mass. 1994 ).

3 .Technology is blurring the already fuzzy line between the
private sphere and the market. Is an Uber car private in a way that a taxicab
is not?

More to the point for the _Roommate.com_ case, how should
the FHA apply to Airbnb? A recent empirical study finds “widespread
discrimination against

guests with distinctly African American names” by Airbnb
hosts. Benjamin Edelman, Michael Luca & Dan Svirsky, Racial Discrimination
in the

Sharing Economy: Evidence from a Field Experiment, 9 ( 2 )
Am. Econ. J.: Applied Econ. 1 , 2 ( 2017 ). Should Airbnb be regulated under
Title II of the

Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination by hotels
and motels? See 42 U.S.C. § 2000 a( 1 ). Note that Title II contains its own
“Mrs. Murphy”

exception for an establishment that provides lodging to
transient guests in a building “which contains not more than five rooms for
rent or hire and

which is actually occupied by the proprietor of such
establishment as his residence.” Id. Or should Airbnb rentals be regarded as
temporary selections of

roommates, given immunity from liability under Title VIII by
the _Roommate.com_ decision? How many of Judge Kozinski’s reasons for treating
space

shared by roommates as not being a dwelling apply to a room
in a house rented through a service like Airbnb?

4 .Would the case have come out differently if roommate.com
invited users to fill out a preference based on race? Religion? (Note that some
of

Judge Kozinski’s examples are based on religious dietary
practices.) If racial preferences should lead to a different result than the
one here, should

questions that have a disparate racial impact, like language
or previous involvement with the justice system, be prohibited as well?

### C. PROPERTY AND EQUITY

The scope of owner sovereignty is pervasively affected by
the law of equity, which we encountered in Chapter I in its role of affording

remedies. In some respects, owner sovereignty is enhanced by
equity, especially through the development of new remedies like injunctions and

some forms of restitution. In other respects, owner
sovereignty is limited by equity, based on defenses to the enforcement of legal
property rights

that apply when owners engage in conduct that is deemed
unjust or “inequitable.”

#416

Ask yourself as you go through the following materials (and
in other chapters and law school courses) what the special province of equity
is

—or whether there is one. The fusion of law and equity has
led some to consider equity to have no special character and to be of
historical

interest only. Alternatively, equity is regarded as pure ex
post fairness-oriented judicial discretion, something to be applauded or
decried,

depending on one’s view of the proper judicial function. The
historic suspicion of equity as involving too much discretion has a long
pedigree

going back at least to the common-law lawyers of the
seventeenth century such as Edward Coke and John Selden, the latter of whom
complained

that because equity was based on the Chancellor’s
conscience, it was a “roguish thing” and would vary from one Chancellor to
another with the

length of “the Chancellor’s foot.” This has animated various
attempts to constrain equitable discretion throughout its history. See also Gee
v.

Pritchard, 36 Eng. Rep. 670, 674 (Ch. 1818); William
Holdsworth, Some Makers of English Law 198 (1938). We return to the issue of
the

structure of equity—its presumptions and shifting burdens—in
the cases that follow.

What might be the characteristic function of equity? As
reflected in the maxims, equity is traditionally a “law about law,” a device to

intervene to solve specific problems when the law is grossly
out of whack. English and American courts and commentators have often referred
to

Aristotle’s notion of equity, which corrects “law where law
is defective because of its generality.” Nicomachean Ethics 317 (G.P. Goold
ed., H.

Rackham trans., Harvard Univ. Press 1982). Legislation can
be imperfect simply because it is not detailed enough to cover all possible
cases, and

perhaps more importantly opportunists are on the lookout for
situations in which the law fails to capture its purpose fully, leaving room
for

exploitation of loopholes. Much of this role for equity came
under the heading of “constructive fraud,” something that cannot be proven to
be

fraud but is dangerous enough to warrant a judicial
response:

In this class [of constructive or legal, as opposed to
actual, intentional, fraud] may properly be included all cases of

unconscientious advantages in bargains, obtained by
imposition, circumvention, surprise, and undue influence over persons in
general;

and in an especial manner, all unconscientious advantages,
or bargains obtained over persons, disabled by weakness, infirmity, age,

lunacy, idiocy, drunkenness, coverture, or other incapacity,
from taking due care of, or protecting their own rights and interests.

Joseph Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence: as
Administered in England and America § 221 (Hillard, Gray & Co. 1 836). To
deal with

constructive fraud, equity must be somewhat open-ended,
because as Story notes, “[f]raud is infinite” given the “fertility of man’s
invention.” Id.

§ 186 (quoting a Letter from Lord Hardwicke to Lord Kaims
(June 30, 1759)). There is no doubt that equity is based on morality and
judicial

#417

discretion, and that it has bad actors in its sight. When it
comes to property, equity pays great attention to who knew what when: Violation
of

rights with notice—in bad faith—is regarded more seriously
than inadvertent violations. See generally Henry E. Smith, Equity as Meta-Law,
130

Yale. L.J. 1050 (2021).

We start our exploration of equity with a seemingly
straightforward problem. At common law, the only remedy for trespass to land
was an

action for damages. Not surprisingly, however, landowners
who got entangled in disputes over land boundaries or who were threatened with

repeated trespasses went to the Court of Chancery, seeking a
mandatory order in the form of an injunction against their adversaries. At
first the

Chancellor refused to grant such relief, stating that equity
was not available to enjoin a “mere trespass.” But eventually, a variety of
exceptions to

this rule emerged. American courts of equity adopted these
exceptions, which gradually became broader over time. The following decision

illustrates the doctrine that eventually emerged.

### 1 .REPEATED TRESPASSES

the Johns Hopkins Medical School. In connection with that
work he became interested in the effect of well-balanced nutrition on stock,
and

began a series of experiments on rabbits to determine
whether over a long period a well-balanced diet would result in improving the
stock. He

kept the rabbits used in those experiments on the farm.
There he also raised hogs and chickens, kept a garden, and raised buckwheat and
other

crops. He and his wife lived there intermittently until
about 1932, and from that time on he has resided there permanently.

Howard county is, and for many years has been, a foxhunting
country, and it is no unusual thing for landowners to keep packs of foxhounds,

but it does not appear that prior to 1930, when the Howard
County Hunt was formed, there was any organized association of the followers of
the

sport. That club is an unincorporated association of more
than seven persons, which occupies a farm at the junction of the Triadelphia
road and

the Glenelg road, also in the Fifth election district of
Howard county some six or seven miles from the Baker farm. The club itself owns
no

hounds, but employs as its huntsman Philip Bowen, who
furnishes and hunts a pack of hounds for it.

Weather permitting, the hounds are hunted three days a week
throughout the hunting season from early in September to April over a

territory which includes the Baker farm. In 1931 Dr. Baker,
it was said, noticed foxhounds accompanied by riders in red hunting coats on
his

farm, and also heard “the horn carried by fox hunters.” At
that time he paid little attention to them, for he had then no “animals of any
great

quantity,” and it made “very little difference.” But by 1933
his stock of rabbits had greatly increased, and on January 14th of that year
near

sunset, while he was feeding the rabbits, he and his wife
heard a great “hue and cry” at the back of the farm, and his wife said, “It
looks as

though the dogs were at our rabbits again.” He “started off
to one of the other points,” and before he got back to her the dogs were
swarming all

around the place. Mrs. Baker attempted to drive them off,
they “seemed to back right against her,” she screamed that she was bitten, he
“rushed

and hollered at the dogs, and before we knew it they were in
the woods.” Following that incident, Mr. T. Stockton Matthews, president of the

club, wrote Dr. Baker a letter in which in part he said:

I was shocked to learn of the most unfortunate annoyance and
damage caused you and Mrs. Baker last Saturday by hounds of the

Howard County Hunt. I immediately got in touch with Mrs.
Clark and others whom I thought might know some more of the

circumstances, with the concern particularly of the injury
to Mrs. Baker and the hope of avoiding the possibility of any serious

infection from the wound.

#419

It is distressing to all of us that such an unprecedented
and unfortunate accident should have happened. In the conduct of the Hunt

and in the control of the hounds, we have endeavored always
to merit the good-will and cordial interest of all those in the community

who are in sympathy with good sport and with the aims and
purposes of the organization to further the best interest of Howard County.

Notwithstanding the assurances in the letter, Dr. Baker
complained that no real effort was made to keep the hounds off his property,
that

they trampled his crops, broke some hot frames, disturbed
his rabbits and his chickens, and so annoyed Mrs. Baker that she left the place
and that

on one occasion in February, 1936, he had been compelled to
shoot several of them to get them off his property where they were frightening
his

chickens. On March 9, 1936, he and Mrs. Baker filed the bill
of complaint in this case against the Howard County Hunt and Philip Bowen, in

which, after reciting these facts, he prayed: “That the said
Howard County Hunt and Philip Bowen, their agents, servants and employees, they

and each of them may be enjoined from hunting across your
Complainants’ property or permitting the pack of Fox Hounds owned by them or in

their custody from hunting or overrunning the land of your
Complainants or in any manner interfering with your Complainants enjoying the

peaceful possession of their property.”

In their answer the defendants averred that “members of the
Howard County Hunt Club have only ridden through the Complainants’

property on one occasion during the past five years; and the
said pack of fox hounds have crossed the Complainants’ property not more than
four

times during said period of five years.” They further
alleged that the injuries to Mrs. Baker “were suffered” more than three years
before the suit,

and that whatever rights she might have had “by reason” of
those injuries “were barred by limitations and laches,” and, while they
admitted that

“their pack of fox hounds” did cross the Baker property in
February, 1936, they denied that they terrified the chickens or destroyed
“freshly laid

eggs,” and as to that occasion they further said “that
Laurence H. Baker, one of the above named Complainants, did wilfully and
without any just

cause whatsoever, deliberately shoot into the said pack of
fox hounds, as a result of which one of them died shortly thereafter and
another is

seriously and permanently injured; and these respondents
aver that the said pack of fox hounds at the time of the shooting as aforesaid
in no way

molested the Complainants or their property but were in the
act of pursuing a fox.”

The case was tried on the issues made by those pleadings,
and at the conclusion of the case the court dismissed the bill.

The important questions presented by the appeal are whether
equity may afford injunctive relief against a series of trespasses which, while

not continuous, are nevertheless part of a single course of
conduct which seriously interferes with the right of a landowner to the
peaceful

#420

enjoyment of his property and, if it may, whether the
appellants have made out a case for such relief. * * *

Without further elaboration of the evidence it is sufficient
to say that it shows without any substantial doubt that the defendants’ hounds

have repeatedly overrun the Baker farm, have done
substantial injury to their property, that defendants have made no serious
effort to prevent the

trespasses, and that the resulting damage is of such a
character that the Bakers can obtain no adequate relief therefor in an action
at law.

Their property is their own; they have an unquestionable
right to enjoy it in peace and quiet without molestation or hindrance and to
use it

for such purpose and pursuits as they will so long as their
use of it does not harm others. On the other hand the defendants devote a part
of their

leisure to the pursuit of an ancient, exhilarating, and
healthful sport which is not only lawful, but which for centuries has added to
the health and

to the pleasure of those who love to combine the freedom and
the freshness of the open spaces with the thrills of the chase, the music of
the

hounds, the rushing air, the creaking of saddle leather, the
dash of the thoroughbred, and the sights and sounds of the countryside in the
crisp air

of the fall and the early winter. They, too, have an
unquestionable right to indulge that inclination but only so long as they do
not permit it to

interfere with the rights of others.

Much interesting learning and some space have been devoted
by counsel for the parties to this appeal in tracing the origin, growth, and

development of the relative rights of fox hunters and the
owners of the land over which they hunt. Indeed, that search has extended from
Bacon’s

Abridgement (1856) to Adkin’s Law of Forestry and Law
Relating to Trespass and Game (London 1914), but in the end there is no dispute
as

there can be no doubt that the rights of the fox hunter are
subordinate to the rights of the landowner, and that, if the hunter himself
goes on the

lands of another against the owner’s will, he is a
trespasser. * * *

In respect to the liability of persons who either send dogs
on the land of another in pursuit of game or of a fox which is not ordinarily

classified as game, or hunt them in a neighborhood when they
have reason to know that the chase will probably take them over land on which

they have no right to go, the law is not so certain. It was
said by some early commentator seeking a way out of the maze that “dog law is
as hard

to define as dog latin,” Citizens’ Rapid-Transit Co. v. Dew,
100 Tenn. 317, 45 S.W. 790 (Tenn. 1898), but since then much of the uncertainty
as

to the responsibility of the owners of dogs for their
trespasses has disappeared. The difficulty of stating with certainty the status
of a dog before

the law is said to inhere in its nature and is inseparable
from its known peculiarities, the difference in breeds, its diverse uses, the
diseases to

which it is subject, its infirmities of temper, and the
impossibility of predicting when or how it will break through the artificial
restraints of

discipline and revert to its original and instinctive
ferocity. 1 R.C.L. 1 1 12.

#421

But as with other branches of the law early doubts have
disappeared, and others have succeeded them, in a natural process of evolution
in

which the law has changed to harmonize with changed
conditions.

From [the] cases and the statements of textwriters it may be
said that, while the owner of a dog which he has no reason to believe is

dangerous or likely to inflict harm upon the persons or
property of others is not liable for its trespasses committed of its own
volition while

roaming abroad, he is liable if he either takes it himself
where he knows that, because of its training, nature, and instinct, it will
probably damage

the property of others, or if with that knowledge he permits
it to stray beyond his control.

Applying that rule to the facts of this case the conclusion
seems inevitable that, after the defendants in this case had been warned in
1933

that their hounds while hunting in the neighborhood of the
appellants’ farm were likely to trespass thereon and inflict damage upon his
property,

they were under a duty to so control their hounds as to
prevent further trespass. Nor is there any serious doubt that in violation of
that duty they

hunted their hounds in the neighborhood of appellants’ farm
knowing that under the impulse of their instincts and training in following the
scent

they might and probably would trespass thereon. Nor is there
any doubt that, as a result of appellees’ indifference to appellants’ rights,
their

negligence in permitting their hounds to be beyond their
control in the neighborhood of appellants’ farm, appellees’ hounds did overrun

appellants’ farm, disturbed and injured their poultry,
rabbits and pigs, and annoyed both Dr. Baker and his wife.

The common law that the owner of a straying reputable dog is
not liable for its trespasses because it was not likely to do much damage, 1

R.C.L. 11 18, cannot well be applied to a pack or body of
fifteen, twenty, or more hounds running as a pack on the same trail, for it is
too obvious

for comment that such a pack may do substantial damage even
to crops.

The notion that a landowner is without remedy for damage or
injury suffered as the result of such an invasion of his rights, or that the
law

affords him no protection against a repetition thereof,
lacks substance and reality.

Appellants contend that their remedy is in equity, appellees
say that appellants are not entitled to equitable relief, first because they
have an

adequate remedy at law, and, second, because they do not
come into equity with clean hands. The second objection is based upon the fact
that Dr.

Baker shot several of the appellees’ hounds while they were
molesting his poultry. It is true that, apart from a statute conferring it, a
landowner

has no right to kill a dog which is merely trespassing, 3 C.
J. 153, but even at common law he may kill it in defense of his person, his
property, or

of other persons, where circumstances justify a reasonable
belief that so extreme and drastic a measure is necessary to protect himself,
his family

or his property from harm. Id. 153–158. * * * Baker
testified that when he shot the hounds they were actually in his chicken yard,

#422

“swarming all through the yards,” that “some of his”
chickens were dead, others were frightened and dashed against the chicken
house, and as a

“result” he had to kill three of them. That testimony was
not contradicted, but, on the other hand, was corroborated by the witness
Johnson, who

said that when they were shot the hounds were running
through the chicken yard. Under such circumstances it cannot be said that
Baker’s act in

shooting the dogs was so tortious as to place him beyond the
pale of equitable relief. Assuming that the dogs were not interested in the
chickens,

but merely ran through or over them in their pursuit of the
fox, Dr. Baker could not be expected to calmly analyze their motives in
invading his

chicken yards, when actually the chickens were flying in all
directions before them.

Nor can it be said that appellants had an adequate remedy at
law. Assuming that they could have recovered damages in an action at law

against the appellees for the repeated invasions of their
property, it does not follow that such damages as they might have recovered
would have

been adequate compensation for the injury done them.

First, because such injuries were in part intangible and
incapable of measurement. Dr. Baker was conducting a series of experiments on

rabbits. That work was interrupted and its value nullified
by the trespassing hounds. The law affords no adequate measure of damages for
such an

injury. Appellants also attempted to use their farm as a
refuge for birds and small animals. The repeated trespasses of the hounds
interfered with

that plan. The threat of the continued trespasses of the
hounds, for those other reasons seriously interfered with their reasonable
enjoyment of the

property. Even though the hounds were, as appellees
contended, “good and kind,” that they never acted “mean,” and were never known
to bite

anybody, the Bakers should not be expected to rely with
complete confidence upon the mildness of their tempers in view of the fact that
they had

“scrambled up” on Mrs. Baker, tore her clothes, took the
skin off the knuckles of both hands, and bit her in the left hand. For the
actual physical

injuries there may have been an adequate legal remedy, but
for the interference with appellants’ enjoyment of their property as affected
by the

threat of continued recurrences of such incidents the law
affords no adequate relief.

Second, where it appears that the defendant manifests an
intention of persisting in the perpetration of unlawful acts, the expense,
annoyance,

and trouble of prosecuting numerous actions at law to
recover trifling damages render an action at law an inadequate remedy.

To justify refusal of equitable relief on the ground that
the applicant therefor has a remedy at law, the legal remedy must be fully
adequate

and complete, Miller’s Equity, p. 678, for, as stated in
Fletcher, Equity Pleading and Practice, p. 246, “The remedy at law which
precludes relief

in equity must be as practical and efficient to the ends of
justice and its prompt administration as the remedy in equity.”

#423

Early cases did hold that equity would not relieve against
trespasses even though continuing, but it is long since settled that equity
will

relieve against continuing, Whalen v. Dalashmutt, 59 Md. 250
(1883), or repeated trespasses committed in pursuance of a single plan or
purpose,

Gilbert v. Arnold, 30 Md. 29 (1869), Georges Creek Coal
& Iron Co.’s Lessee v. Detmold, 1 Md. 225 (1851). In Waring v. Stinchcomb,
119 A.

336, 340 (Md. 1922), the court quoted with approval this
statement found in Shipley v. Ritter, 7 Md. 408 (1855): “It is the settled law
of this

state, that although an injunction will not be granted to
restrain a trespasser merely because he is a trespasser, yet equity will
interfere where the

injury is irreparable, or where full and adequate relief
cannot be granted at law, or where the trespass goes to the destruction of the
property as it

had been held and enjoyed, or * * * to prevent multiplicity
of suits.”

In Spelling on Injunctions, etc. (2d Ed.) § 14 (1893), it is
said: “An injunction lies to prevent threatened trespasses, though the damage
be

susceptible of compensation, where otherwise there is a
probability of the wrong being often repeated. * * * ”

Pomeroy in his work on Equitable Remedies (section 496) page
4338 et seq., after stating the minority view that equity will not intervene to

prevent repeated trespasses by a single defendant, states
that: “The jurisdiction of equity to restrain continuous or repeated trespasses
rests on the

ground of avoiding a repetition of similar actions. * * *
When the trespasses complained of are caused by the separate acts of
individuals, a

multiplicity of suits may be caused to plaintiff either
because the defendants are numerous or because a single defendant does the same
or similar

acts repeatedly. * * * The other view, and the one sustained
alike by the weight of authority and by principle, is that if a defendant
manifests a

purpose to persist in perpetrating his unlawful acts, the
vexation, expense and trouble of prosecuting the actions at law make the legal
remedy

inadequate, and justify a plaintiff in coming into equity
for an injunction.” * * *

It follows that equity had jurisdiction to grant relief to
the appellants; that they made out a case justifying such relief; that the
injunction

prayed in their bill should have issued; and that there was
error in refusing to grant the injunction and in dismissing this bill.

The decree appealed from must therefore be reversed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The issue in _Baker_ is not whether the Bakers have the
right to exclude foxhunting parties and their dogs from their land—it is
assumed they do

—but rather whether they can obtain an injunction
permanently barring the Howard County Hunt Club from invading their land in the
future, or whether

they must sue for damages if and when such intrusions occur.
Is the mode of reasoning adopted by the court in answering this question
similar to that

used by the New Jersey Supreme Court in determining whether
a public policy exception to the right to exclude applies?

```



424



```

See _State v. Shack_ and _Uston v. Resorts International_ ,
Part B. 4 , supra. Or are there important differences between the inquiry
characteristic of equity and

the balancing of interests invoked by the New Jersey Supreme
Court?

2. _Baker_ illustrates two important maxims of equity: that
   he who comes into equity must come with clean hands and that equity will
   intercede only

when the remedy at law is inadequate. Are you persuaded by
the court’s resolution of the clean hands issue? Suppose Dr. Baker did not
shoot the dogs in

the heat of the moment with chickens flying all about, but
instead had lain in wait for them and fired as soon as they crossed the
boundary into his farm.

Should the court deny an injunction in these circumstances?
Does the possibility of seeking punitive damages for intentional trespass, as
authorized in

_Jacque v. Steenberg Homes_ (Chapter I), call into question
the conclusion that the Bakers’ remedy at law was inadequate? On the facts
presented, would

the Bakers be entitled to punitive damages had they sued for
damages? Do punitive damages and injunctions serve somewhat interchangeable
functions

here? Which remedy is more likely to protect the Bakers from
future harassment by fox hunting parties?

3 .According to the court, the first reason the remedy at
law is inadequate is that the injuries sustained to the Bakers’ property “were
in part

intangible and incapable of measurement.” Will this be true
in every case of threatened trespass to land? When one adds up all the
exceptions to the rule

that equity will not enjoin a mere trespass—if the injury is
irreparable, or if the injury cannot be fully compensated by awards of damages,
or if a series

of trespasses have been repeated by the same person, or if
multiple trespasses are being threatened by different persons—have the
exceptions swallowed

the rule? Would it be simpler and more accurate to say that
equity will always enjoin a threatened trespass, as long as the risk of such an
invasion is

sufficiently great? (How great? More likely than not to
occur?) Or would stating the rule in such an unequivocal fashion be
undesirable, because it

would deprive equity of its traditional discretion to grant
or withhold mandatory relief in light of a wide range of factors that bear on
the justice of the

situation?

4 .How do you suppose Ronald Coase (Chapter I) would respond
to the _Baker_ case? Is this just like his example of the rancher and the
farmer, or

the various nuisance cases he discusses? Should the court
have given more consideration to whether the Bakers’ farm is more valuable (in
terms of the

parties’ willingness to pay) if used for raising
experimental rabbits or as a site for fox hunts? The transaction costs here do
not seem to be too great;

there are only two parties to the dispute and they have had
some communication with each other before the lawsuit is filed. Why do you
suppose they

did not resolve their differences by contracting for some
mutually satisfactory solution?

5 .If the court had denied an injunction to the Bakers, and
any damages they received would be inadequate to deter future intrusions by the
Hunt

Club, would the Bakers have been able to purchase peace and
quiet for their rabbits by entering into a contract with the Hunt Club? See
Louis Kaplow &

Steven Shavell, Property Rules Versus Liability Rules: An
Economic Analysis, 109 Harv. L. Rev. 713 , 722 ( 1996 ): “[E]ven though I

```

would be willing to pay Jack not to take my car if it were
inadequately valued by the courts, there would be no point in paying him to
desist—for Jill, or

someone else, could come along and take it the next day.
Consequently, I would not pay Jack to forbear, and not being paid, he would in
fact take my

car.” Does this consideration provide a justification for
awarding either injunctions or punitive damages against repeated trespasses,
without regard to

whether the trespassing activity is more valuable than the
activity of the person trespassed upon?

### 2 .RESTITUTION

Equity, especially in its role of protecting property
rights, is closely associated with restitution and unjust enrichment. The law
of restitution

joins together older bodies of law, some which traced back
to common law and some to equity, but all of which were guided by precepts of

equity and the equitable style of decisionmaking.
Restitution occupies an important place in the landscape of civil liability.
The common law of

contracts is broadly concerned with bargained-for benefits
and harms. The common law of torts is broadly concerned with non-bargained-for

harms. This leaves a category of events unaccounted for:
non-bargained-for benefits. Issues involving non-bargained-for benefits are
often said to

be covered by the law of restitution. There is some
ambiguity in the term “restitution,” because it can refer to a remedy or to a
substantive basis

for liability relating to non-bargained-for benefits.

Not just any non-bargained-for benefit will give rise to
liability. Often it is said that the characteristic substantive basis for
liability in

restitution is unjust enrichment. Consider a mistaken
payment: If A mistakenly pays B a debt she owes to C, can A sue B to undo the
transfer and

get the payment back? There was no contract between A and B,
and B has committed no tort, but B would be unjustly enriched at A’s expense if

he retained the payment. We have already seen the use of
restitution in a case of trespass to land. A later stage of the Great Onyx Cave
litigation

(Chapter II) dealt with how much of the profits from the
cave business the trespasser would have to disgorge. Edwards v. Lee’s
Administrator, 96

S.W.2d 102 8, 1029 (Ky. 1936). This can be regarded as a
restitutionary remedy for a wrong. Or, it can be said that it is necessary to
reverse the

unjust enrichment that would result if the trespasser were
to retain the gains from the wrong. Are these views different? Consider the
following

case.

#### Olwell v. Nye & Nissen Co.

```



Supreme Court of Washington, 1946.



173 P. 2 d 652.



```

■
MALLERY, JUSTICE. On May 6 , 1940, plaintiff, E. L. Olwell, sold and
transferred to the defendant corporation his one-half interest in Puget

Sound Egg Packers, a Washington corporation having its
principal place of business in Tacoma. By the terms of the agreement, the
plaintiff was

#426

to retain full ownership in an “Eggsact” egg-washing
machine, formerly used by Puget Sound Egg Packers. The defendant promised to
make it

available for delivery to the plaintiff on or before June
15, 1940. It appears that the plaintiff arranged for and had the machine stored
in a space

adjacent to the premises occupied by the defendant but not
covered by its lease. Due to the scarcity of labor immediately after the
outbreak of the

war, defendant’s treasurer, without the knowledge or consent
of the plaintiff, ordered the egg washer taken out of storage. The machine was
put

into operation by defendant on May 31, 1941 , and thereafter
for a period of three years was used approximately one day a week in the
regular

course of the defendant’s business. Plaintiff first
discovered this use in January or February of 1945 when he happened to be at
the plant on

business and heard the machine operating. Thereupon
plaintiff offered to sell the machine to defendant for $600 or half of its
original cost in

1929. A counter offer of $50 was refused and approximately
      one month later this action was commenced to recover the reasonable value of

defendant’s use of the machine, and praying for $25 per
month from the commencement of the unauthorized use until the time of trial. *

* * The

court entered judgment for plaintiff in the amount of $10
per week for the period of 156 weeks covered by the statute of limitations, or
$1,560,

and gave the plaintiff his costs.

Defendant has appealed to this court assigning error upon
the judgment, upon the trial of the cause on the theory of unjust enrichment,
upon

the amount of damages, and upon the court’s refusal to make
a finding as to the value of the machine and in refusing to consider such value
in

measuring damages.

The theory of the [plaintiff] was that the tort of
conversion could be “waived” and suit brought in quasi-contract, upon a
contract implied in

law, to recover, as restitution, the profits which inured to
[defendant] as a result of its wrongful use of the machine. With this the trial
court

agreed and in its findings of facts found that the use of
the machine “resulted in a benefit to the users, in that said use saves the
users

approximately $1.43 per hour of use as against the expense
which would be incurred were eggs to be washed by hand; that said machine was

used by Puget Sound Egg Packers and defendant, on an average
of one day per week from May of 1941, until February of 1945 at an average

saving of $10.00 per each day of use.”

In substance, the argument presented by the assignments of
error is that the principle of unjust enrichment, or quasi-contract, is not of

universal application, but is imposed only in exceptional
cases because of special facts and circumstances and in favor of particular
persons; that

[plaintiff] had an adequate remedy in an action at law for
replevin or claim and delivery; that any damages awarded to the plaintiff
should be

based upon the use or rental value of the machine and should
bear some reasonable relation to its market value. [Defendant] therefore
contends

that the amount of the judgment is excessive.

#427

It is uniformly held that in cases where the defendant tort
feasor has benefited by his wrong, the plaintiff may elect to “waive the tort”
and

bring an action in assumpsit for restitution. Such an action
arises out of a duty imposed by law devolving upon the defendant to repay an
unjust

and unmerited enrichment. Woodward, The Law of
Quasi-Contracts, § 272(2), p. 439; Keener on Quasi-Contracts, p. 160. See also
Professor

Corbin’s articles, “‘Waiver of Tort and Suit in Assumpsit,”
19 Yale Law Journal, p. 221, and “Quasi-Contractual Obligations,” 21 Yale Law

Journal, p. 533.

It is clear that the saving in labor cost which [defendant]
derived from its use of [plaintiff’s] machine constituted a benefit.

According to the Restatement of Restitution, § 1(b), p. 12,

A person confers a benefit upon another if he gives to the
other possession of or some other interest in money, land, chattels, or

choses in action, performs services beneficial to or at the
request of the other, satisfies a debt or a duty of the other, or in any way
adds

to the other’s security or advantage. He confers a benefit
not only where he adds to the property of another, but also where he saves the

other from expense or loss. The word “benefit”, therefore
denotes any form of advantage.

(Italics ours)

It is also necessary to show that while [defendant]
benefited from its use of the egg-washing machine, [plaintiff] thereby incurred
a loss. It is

argued by [defendant] that since the machine was put into
storage by [plaintiff], who had no present use for it, and for a period of
almost three

years did not know that [defendant] was operating it and
since it was not injured by its operation and the [defendant] never adversely
claimed any

title to it, nor contested [plaintiff’s] right of
repossession upon the latter’s discovery of the wrongful operation, that the
[plaintiff] was not

damaged because he is as well off as if the machine had not
been used by [defendant].

The very essence of the nature of property is the right to
its exclusive use. Without it, no beneficial right remains. However plausible,
the

[defendant] cannot be heard to say that his wrongful
invasion of the [plaintiff’s] property right to exclusive use is not a loss
compensable in law.

To hold otherwise would be subversive of all property rights
since his use was admittedly wrongful and without claim of right. The theory of

unjust enrichment is applicable in such a case.

We agree with [defendant] that [plaintiff] could have
elected a “common garden variety of action,” as he calls it, for the recovery
of

damages. It is also true that except where provided for by
statute, punitive damages are not allowed, the basic measure for the recovery
of

damages in this state being compensation. If, then,
[plaintiff] had been limited to redress in tort for damages, as [defendant]
contends, the court

below would be in error in refusing to make a finding as to
the value of

#428

the machine. In such case the award of damages must bear a
reasonable relation to the value of the property. Hoff v. Lester, 168 P.2d 409
(Wash.

1946).

But [plaintiff] here had an election. He chose rather to
waive his right of action in tort and to sue in assumpsit on the implied
contract.

Having so elected, he is entitled to the measure of
restoration which accompanies the remedy.

Actions for restitution have for their primary purpose
taking from the defendant and restoring to the plaintiff something to which

the plaintiff is entitled, or if this is not done, causing
the defendant to pay the plaintiff an amount which will restore the plaintiff
to the

position in which he was before the defendant received the
benefit. If the value of what was received and what was lost were always

equal, there would be no substantial problem as to the
amount of recovery, since actions of restitution are not punitive. In fact,

however, the plaintiff frequently had lost more than the
defendant has gained, and sometimes the defendant has gained more than the

plaintiff has lost.

In such cases the measure of restitution is determined with
reference to the tortiousness of the defendant’s conduct or the

negligence or other fault of one or both of the parties in
creating the situation giving rise to the right to restitution. If the
defendant was

tortious in his acquisition of the benefit he is required to
pay for what the other has lost although that is more than the recipient

benefited. If he was consciously tortious in acquiring the
benefit, he is also deprived of any profit derived from his subsequent dealing

with it. If he was no more at fault than the claimant, he is
not required to pay for losses in excess of benefit received by him and he is

permitted to retain gains which result from his dealing with
the property.

(Italics ours) Restatement of Restitution, pp. 595, 596.

[Plaintiff] may recover the profit derived by the
[defendant] from the use of the machine. [The court then followed Washington
caselaw

according to which the maximum the plaintiff could receive
was the amount prayed for in the complaint, here $25 per month for 36 months,
or

$900.]

The judgment as modified is affirmed. [Defendant] will
recover its costs.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The basic elements of an action for restitution are: ( 1
) an “enrichment” of the defendant; ( 2 ) at the expense of the plaintiff; ( 3
) under

circumstances that are “unjust.” See Warren A. Seavey &
Austin W. Scott, Restitution, 54 L.Q. Rev. 29 , 32 ( 1938 ). Note carefully the
relational nature

of the claim for restitution. There must be a particular
defendant who has experienced some kind of windfall, but it must be a windfall
“at the expense”

of a particular identified plaintiff. Thus, severe
misfortune by the plaintiff that does not enrich another particular person will
not do. Nor does blind luck

on the part of the defendant if this does not come at the
expense of someone else. It takes two to make a claim for restitution, and this
significantly

cabins the scope of the action. In _Olwell_ , the violation
of the plaintiff’s property rights makes for injustice, even if the tort itself
is “waived” in order to

proceed on the unjust enrichment theory. Still, the general
formulation of the principle raises a number of vexing questions—most obviously
about what

makes an enrichment of the defendant at the expense of the
plaintiff “unjust.”

2 .The court says to deny the plaintiff’s right to elect
restitution “would be subversive of all property rights since [the defendant’s]
use was

wrongful and without claim of right.” Does this make
restitution another source of protection for the property owner’s right to
exclude? The plaintiff

Olwell made no attempt to use or rent the machine, and there
is no evidence that the defendant’s use damaged the machine. Is Olwell’s
situation

analogous to that of Mr. and Mrs. Jacque in _Jacque v.
Steenberg Homes_ , complaining of an invasion of rights where there has been no
injury? There are

also overtones here of the distinction between good faith
and bad faith

```

```

defendants, which looms large in the building encroachment
cases considered infra. As the opinion notes, a person who had used the
egg-washing

machine through a good faith mistake would be liable only
for the rental value or the value of the machine, not for the apparently higher
amount “saved”

by the use of the machine. (Why isn’t the rental value the
amount “saved”?) Does this give the case a punitive flavor, despite what the
court says? Did

the defendant’s entering the storage area to remove the
machine make this worse than if it had misused a machine entrusted to its
possession? Should the

Washington statute be amended to allow for punitive damages
for violations of personal property rights?

3 .The potential robustness of the protection of property
through unjust enrichment and restitution can be illustrated with a variant on
the scenario

in _Olwell_. What if the defendant had simply stolen the
machine and sold it to someone else? As we will see in Chapter VIII, in the
United States an

original owner can get his goods back, even from someone who
bought the good from the thief in good faith. But suppose the egg-washing
machine is

long gone and the plaintiff is able to sue the thief. What
should be the measure of damages? Again, the innocent plaintiff has a choice of
methods of

going after the conscious wrongdoer. The plaintiff could
impose a _constructive trust_ on the proceeds of the sale. And because the
defendant is a

wrongdoer, presumptions will work in favor of the plaintiff:
If the defendant put the proceeds (say $ 500 ) in a bank account that had $ 800
in it already,

and then made a withdrawal of $ 500 , bet the $ 500 at the
racetrack and won an additional $ 2 , 000 , then the plaintiff would have a
claim for the full

$ 2 , 500. The defendant is said to hold the proceeds as a
“constructive” trustee for the plaintiff, reflecting the duty to return “his”
money. If, on the other

hand, the defendant had lost at the racetrack, the plaintiff
could seek $ 500 from the account. The theory here is that the plaintiff is
seeking “his” property

and its substitutes over time. This is dramatically
illustrated when the wrongdoer is insolvent (as wrongdoers often are in such
situations): The plaintiff’s

other creditors have to share the inadequate assets for
pennies on the dollar, but the restitution plaintiff simply asks for his
property back in full. State

law varies, but the plaintiff’s ability to seek the abnormal
returns from an asset (the racetrack winnings) is often more limited in the
case of a good faith

defendant (e.g. the recipient of a mistaken payment), or in
cases in which the restitution plaintiff is competing with general creditors.
For an argument

that the litigation arising out of Bernard Madoff’s recent
epic Ponzi scheme could have been better handled if more attention had been
paid to

background principles of restitution, see Andrew Kull,
Common-Law Restitution and the Madoff Liquidation, 92 B.U. L. Rev. 939 ( 2012
).

4 .The origins of unjust enrichment and restitution go back
to efforts by James Barr Ames and later William Keener at the Harvard Law
School to

bring together quasi-contract and constructive trust into
one body of law dealing with unjust enrichment regardless of the court of
origin (constructive

trust being in equity and quasi-contract being “at law”
although with a heavy equitable flavor). In 1937 , two American law professors,
Warren A.

Seavey and Austin W. Scott, drew on these earlier ideas to
bring together a number of situations involving non-bargained-for benefits or
unjust

enrichment and

```



431



```

gave them a name: the law of restitution. Their efforts were
given legitimacy by the American Law Institute, which published their
_Restatement (First)

of Restitution_ in 1937. The first _Restatement_ identified
equitable considerations as the normative foundation for the law of
restitution. See Restatement

(First) of Restitution § 42 ( 1 ). The idea that unjust
enrichment is inequitable can in fact be traced back to antiquity. The Roman
jurist Pomponius of the

second century A.D. is quoted as saying: “For it is by
nature fair that nobody should enrich himself at the expense of another.” Mark
P. Gergen, What

Renders Enrichment Unjust?, 79 Tex. L. Rev. 1927 , 1927
& n. 1 ( 2001 ).

In recent years the law of restitution has become a matter
of theoretical interest among scholars in England, other commonwealth
countries, Israel,

and many civil-law countries. Although interest has lagged
in the United States, the birthplace of restitution, it appears to be picking
up here as well,

especially with the recent publication of the _Restatement
Third, Restitution and Unjust Enrichment_ under the direction of Andrew Kull
(the Second

Restatement was abandoned in the 1980 s before completion).
The subject is fascinating, in part because it does not easily fit within the
common-law

trilogy of contracts-torts-property, and in part because it
presents a challenge to explain the doctrine in terms of theoretical frameworks
such as

economic analysis or corrective justice. See, e.g., Saul
Levmore, Explaining Restitution, 71 Va. L. Rev. 65 ( 1985 ) (seeking to explain
restitution in terms

of wealth distribution effects and a desire to encourage
participation in markets); Ernest J. Weinrib, Correctively Unjust Enrichment,
in Philosophical

Foundations of the Law of Unjust Enrichment 31 (Robert
Chambers, Charles Mitchell & James Penner, eds. 2009 ) (justifying unjust
enrichment in

terms of corrective justice); see generally Ward Farnsworth,
Restitution: Civil Liability for Unjust Enrichment ( 2014 ); Symposium: A
Conference on

Restitution and Unjust Enrichment, 92 B.U. L. Rev. 763 (
2012 ).

5 .What is the basis for liability in restitution? Here
there is some confusion because “restitution” can refer to a remedy as well as
a substantive

basis for liability. Many see the substance of restitution
in unjust enrichment, but the idea that unjust enrichment can form an
independent basis for

liability has been criticized on two grounds. One criticism
is that the doctrine seems to rest solely on principles of morality, rather
than on a more solid

foundation in law. See Restatement Third, Restitution and
Unjust Enrichment § 1 cmt. b ( 2011 ). In an effort to address this criticism,
the authors of the

new _Restatement_ propose to cabin restitution as falling
within a set of circumstances they term _unjustified_ enrichment—“enrichment
that lacks an

adequate legal basis” because “it results from a transaction
that the law treats as ineffective to work a conclusive alteration in ownership
rights.” Id.

Some examples include a transfer of property to another
based on a good faith mistake of fact about the item being transferred or the
identity of the

transferee; the provision of emergency medical services to a
person who is unconscious and cannot give her assent; or profits gained beyond
ordinary

rental value from intentionally trespassing on someone’s
land. See also Andrew Kull, Rationalizing Restitution, 83 Cal. L. Rev. 1191 (
1995 ).

```



432



```

Another criticism is that restitution does not embody any
unitary principle, but merely reflects a miscellany of circumstances giving
rise to the

right to restitution. See Peter Birks, Unjust Enrichment and
Wrongful Enrichment, 79 Tex. L. Rev. 1767 ( 2001 ); Christopher T. Wonnell,
Replacing the

Unitary Principle of Unjust Enrichment, 45 Emory L.J. 153 ,
191 ( 1996 ). Emily Sherwin, for example, argues that unjust enrichment serves
merely a

descriptive and organizational function—“a common theme of
the various doctrines grouped together as restitution”—rather than being a
unified

doctrine complementing common-law rules of contract, tort,
and property. Emily Sherwin, Restitution and Equity: An Analysis of the
Principle of

Unjust Enrichment, 79 Tex. L. Rev. 2083 , 2108 – 12 ( 2001
). Hanoch Dagan is less skeptical, and sees unjust enrichment as a loose
framework that

encompasses benefit-based liabilities that do not fit within
the fields of tort, contract, or property law. He advocates using the principle
of unjust

enrichment as a launching point for a contextual normative
analysis that weighs other values such as autonomy, utility, and community. See
Hanoch

Dagan, The Law and Ethics of Restitution 14 – 15 ( 2004 ).
But Dagan also worries that the open-ended nature of this equitable principle
may be criticized

for allowing judges “unbridled discretion” to fashion
remedies.

However these debates are eventually resolved, there is a
widespread consensus that restitution is an appropriate remedy in certain
circumstances.

Be alert throughout these materials for situations in which
principles of unjust enrichment or restitution are at work, either in name or
in practice.

### 3 .BUILDING ENCROACHMENTS

Minor building encroachments are a recurring issue in
property law that presents other dimensions of equity. If an owner knowingly
and

deliberately builds over the boundary of the parcel on the
land of another, a court will have no hesitation in enjoining the
structure—ordering it to

be torn down. Building such a structure and leaving it there
is a trespass, and as we have seen, a repeated or continuing trespass will
normally be

enjoined. More vexing for courts is the question whether
they should enjoin trespasses involving inadvertent and innocent building

encroachments. In the typical case, A builds a structure
thinking it is on his own land, but it turns out that some portion of the
building is actually

on B’s land. The portion of the building on B’s land is a
continuing trespass. Does this mean that B is entitled to an injunction that
would require

—in the extreme case—that the entire building be torn down?
Consider the following decisions.

#433

#### Pile v. Pedrick

```



Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, 1895.



31 A. 646.



```

Bill in equity to compel the removal of a wall.

The bill averred that the parties owned adjoining
properties, that the defendants had erected a large factory and had in its
erection exercised

their right to use a portion of the plaintiffs’ ground for
their party wall; that the defendants were building an additional story to
their factory and

had inserted some windows in the said wall, and were about
to insert others. The bill prayed for an order on defendants to remove the
windows

already inserted, and an injunction as to the others.

The answer denied that the defendants exercised the right to
use a portion of plaintiffs’ ground for their party wall, and alleged that the
wall

erected by them is entirely upon their own ground, as they
are advised and verily believe; that they have had the premises surveyed by
competent

surveyors, and knowing they would want to put windows in
their wall they employed competent builders and architects, and instructed them
to

build the premises wholly upon the land of defendants, and
not in any part of said wall to use plaintiffs’ premises.

The case was referred to Charles H. Mathews, Esq., as
master, who found as a fact that the brick wall of defendants, which is
eighteen

inches thick, is clear of the property line, from Buttonwood
street to Hamilton street, and that it stands its entire length on the
defendants’ land.

That the brick wall rests upon a foundation wall which is
two feet thick, and that this foundation wall was clear of the plaintiffs’
property from

Hamilton street, north, to a point about fifty feet south of
Buttonwood street; but, that for the said fifty feet, the said foundation wall
encroached

on the plaintiffs’ property on an average of one and a half
inches to one and five eighths inches. * * *

On February 6th, the court entered the following decree: * *
*

Order and decree that the defendants by their workmen and
pursuant to a permit of the building inspectors have leave to remove so

much of their wall mentioned in the master’s report, as is
upon the ground of the plaintiffs, replacing it by a wall of the existing width

to be wholly upon the defendants’ ground. But in so doing
the said workmen shall not enter upon or dig into the ground of the

plaintiffs.

And that the costs of the case shall be paid the respective
parties, one half by each.

And it is further ordered that if the permission herein be
not exercised within a reasonable time, the plaintiffs have leave to apply to
the

court for further direction or order.

#434

Errors assigned by plaintiffs were among others, * * * in
not directing defendants to remove the windows placed in the wall; * * * [in

decreeing] as above, quoting last three paragraphs of
decree.

Errors assigned by defendants were among others, * * * in
failing to order and decree that the plaintiffs permit the defendants to enter
upon

the premises of the plaintiffs and remove so much of the
wall of the defendants as is upon the ground of the plaintiffs; in decreeing
that the costs

of the case should be paid by the respective parties, one
half by each.

■
WILLIAMS, J. The learned judge of the court below was right in holding that the
wall in controversy was not a party wall. It was not intended to

be. The defendants were building a factory, and, under the
advice of their architect, decided to build within their own lines, in order to
avoid the

danger of injury to others from vibration which might result
from the use of their machinery. They called upon the district surveyor to
locate their

line, and built within it, as so ascertained. Subsequent
surveys by city surveyors have determined that the line was not accurately
located at first,

but was about 1 1/2 inches over on the plaintiffs’. This
leaves the ends of the stones used in the foundation wall projecting into the
plaintiffs’

lands, below the surface, 1 3/8 inches. This unintentional
intrusion into the plaintiffs’ close is the narrow foundation on which this
bill in equity

rests. The wall resting on the stone foundation is conceded
to be within the defendants’ line. The defendants offered, nevertheless, to
make it a

party wall, by agreement, and give to plaintiffs the free
use of it, as such, on condition that the windows on the third and fourth
floors should

remain open until the plaintiffs should desire to use the
wall. This offer was declined. The trespass was then to be remedied in one of
two ways:

It could be treated, with the plaintiffs’ consent, as a
permanent trespass, and compensated for in damages, or the defendants could be
compelled

to remove the offending ends of the stones to the other side
of the line. The plaintiffs insisted upon the latter course, and the court
below has, by

its decree, ordered that this should be done. The defendants
then sought permission to go on the plaintiffs’ side of the line and chip off
the

projecting ends, offering to pay for all inconvenience or
injury the plaintiffs or their tenants might suffer by their so doing. This
they refused.

Nothing remained but to take down and rebuild the entire
wall from the defendants’ side, and with their building resting on it. This the
decree

requires, but in view of the course of the litigation the
learned judge divided the costs. This is the chief ground of complaint on this
appeal. Costs

are not of course, in equity. They may be given or withheld
as equity and good conscience require. It often happens that a chancellor is

constrained to enforce a legal right under circumstances
that involve hardship to the defendant, and in such cases it is, as it should
be, common to

dispose of the costs upon a consideration of all the
circumstances, and the position and conduct of the parties. The costs in this
case were within

the power of the chancellor. They were disposed of in the
exercise of his official discretion, and we see no reason to doubt that they
were

disposed

#435

of properly. The decree is affirmed; the costs of this
appeal to be paid by the appellants.

#### Pile v. Pedrick

```



Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, 1895.



31 A. 647.



```

■
WILLIAMS, J. This is an appeal from the same decree just considered in Pile v.
Pedrick , 31 Atl. 64 6. It is not denied that the foundation wall on

which the appellant has built was located under a mistake
made by the district surveyor, and does in fact project slightly into the
plaintiffs’ land.

For one inch and three-eighths, the ends of the stones in
the wall are said to project beyond the division line. The defendants have no
right, at law

or in equity, to occupy land that does not belong to them,
and we do not see how the court below could have done otherwise than recognize
and

act upon this principle. They must remove their wall, so
that it shall be upon their land. This the court directed should be done within
a

reasonable time. To avoid further controversy over this
subject, we will so far modify the decree as to permit such removal to be made
within one

year from the date of filing hereof. In all other respects
the decree is affirmed; the appellants to pay all costs made by them upon this
appeal.

#### Golden Press, Inc. v. Rylands

```



Supreme Court of Colorado, 1951.



235 P. 2 d 592.



```

■ STONE,
JUSTICE. Plaintiffs Rylands and Reid owned a parcel of land fronting on West
Colfax Avenue, Jefferson County, upon which were

located their residence and garage and some rental cottages.
Defendant Golden Press, Inc., constructed a one-story brick and cinder block

business building on its property which adjoined plaintiffs’
property on the east. According to plaintiffs’ survey here unchallenged, the
west wall

of defendant’s building is two inches clear of the lot line
at the front or south end, is exactly on the line at the north end, and is
approximately

160 feet in length.

In the action here involved, plaintiffs allege that in
[constructing] the building defendant caused its foundation and footings to
extend from

two to three and a half inches upon plaintiffs’ land. * * *
Plaintiffs prayed for injunction requiring that defendant remove all footings
and

foundations upon their property * * * Upon issue raised by
general denial the case was tried to a jury as to the issue of damages alleged
by

trespass, the court reserving the determination of the issue
of injunction. On the issue of damages the jury returned a verdict in favor of
the

defendant. The court then found encroachment as alleged and
granted mandatory injunction requiring that defendant’s projecting footings be

removed from plaintiffs’ property * * *

#436

Ordinarily, mandatory injunction will issue to compel
removal of encroaching structures, but it is not to be issued as a matter of
course. On

appeal to the court for an equitable remedy, the court must
consider the peculiar equities of the case. A study of many decisions discloses
no

specific and universally-accepted rule as to encroachments.
Even in jurisdictions like Massachusetts, in which it has been declared that

mandatory injunction for removal of encroachment can only be
denied where estoppel or laches is shown, Beaudoin v. Sinodinos, 48 N.E.2d 19

(Mass. 1943), there are numerous cases where injunction has
been refused in the absence of those defenses. See cases cited as exceptional
in

Geragosian v. Un. Realty Co., 193 N.E. 726 (Mass. 1935).
Generally in other jurisdictions such harsh rule is not followed. Sometimes a
slight

and harmless encroachment is held to be within the rule “de
minimis,” as in Tramonte v. Colarusso, 152 N.E. 90 (Mass. 1 926), and McKean v.

Alliance Land Co., 253 P. 134 (Cal. 1927), and generally the
courts require that he who seeks equity should do equity and come with clean

hands. Tramonte v. Colarusso, supra; McKee v. Fields, 210
P.2d 115 (Or. 1949)

Where the encroachment is deliberate and constitutes a
willful and intentional taking of another’s land, equity may well require its

restoration regardless of the expense of removal as compared
with damage suffered therefrom; but where the encroachment was in good faith,
we

think the court should weigh the circumstances so that it
shall not act oppressively. 5 Pomeroy’ Equity Jurisprudence, page 852, § 508.
While the

mere balance of convenience is not the proper test, yet
relative hardship may properly be considered and the court should not become a
party to

extortion. Restatement of the Law, Torts, § 94 1. Where
defendant’s encroachment is unintentional and slight, plaintiff’s use not
affected and his

damage small and fairly compensable, while the cost of
removal is so great as to cause grave hardship or otherwise make its removal

unconscionable, mandatory injunction may properly be denied
and plaintiff relegated to compensation in damages. Owenson v. Bradley, 197

N.W. 885 (N.D. 1924); Nebel v. Guyer, 221 P.2d 337 (Cal.
Dist. Ct. App. 1950); Mary Jane Stevens Co. v. First Nat’l Bldg. Co., 57 P.2d
1099

(Utah 1936).

In the case before us issue was raised in the argument as to
whether or not the encroachment was intentional. There was no finding on this

issue by the trial court and the decree is not necessarily
predicated upon intent. In the absence of proof to the contrary there is a
presumption that

men act in good faith and that they intend to do what they
have the right to do. Prior to the building of the wall, plaintiffs and
defendant each

employed a surveyor, but neither was called as a witness and
the results of their surveys are not disclosed * * *

There is disclosed continued argument by plaintiffs with
representatives of defendant during construction of the wall as to trespassing
on

their lands, but we find no evidence from the record

#437

challenging the good faith of defendant’s representative in
locating the footings.

Again we note that while plaintiffs were continually
complaining as to trespass of the workmen on their property, they took no steps
for

injunction or other legal determination of the disputed line
until after both the foundation and upper wall were completed.

Further, we note that the encroachment here complained of is
very slight. It is conceded that the wall above the foundation does not project

over the property line and that the only encroachment
consists of a projection of the footings a distance of two inches at the
middle, increasing to

three and a half inches at the north end. The top of these
footings is about seven feet below the surface of the ground and they go down
to nine

feet below the surface. They constitute no interference
whatever with plaintiffs’ present use of the property as a driveway and iris
bed, and the

only testimony as to future damage was to the effect that if
plaintiffs wished to build to their line with a basement, they would have to
detour

around this slight projection of defendant’s footings.

The testimony indicates that the value of plaintiffs’ lands
is approximately $200 per front foot, so that if defendant had taken the entire
strip

of three and a half inches both at and below the surface,
its value would have been only about $55, and the value of the portions
extending from

seven to nine feet below the surface and only along the rear
eighty feet of wall would appear to be very small. Plaintiffs, at the trial,
refused

defendant permission to enter upon their property for the
purpose of chipping off the encroaching footings with a jack hammer, and
demanded

that they be removed from defendant’s side of the land, if
necessary by tearing down the wall. The expense and hardship of such removal
would

be so great in comparison with any advantage of plaintiffs
to be gained thereby that we think it would be unconscionable to require it,
and that

under all the circumstances disclosed mandatory injunction
should have been denied by the trial court, with permission for plaintiffs to
proceed,

if desired, in damages.

Accordingly, the injunctive decree is reversed and the case
remanded for further proceedings, if desired, consistent herewith.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The encroachments in _Pile_ and _Golden Press_ were
extremely minimal—just a matter of a few inches underneath the soil in both
cases. Yet the

courts in both cases accept that these intrusions are
trespasses, and that some type of rectification is needed to vindicate the
property rights of the

encroached-upon landowner. This in itself is a testament to
the hold of the _ad coelum_ rule (discussed in connection with _Hinman_ in
Chapter I and

_Edwards v. Sims_ in Chapter II) on the judicial mind. But
does rigid enforcement of property boundaries make sense in this context?
Another approach,

as noted in _Golden Press_ , would declare that very small
intrusions are “de minimis” and hence would entitle the plaintiff to only
nominal

```



438



```

damages. Would you favor this approach over the approaches
of _Pile_ and _Golden Press_? If so, what would be the point at which “de
minimis” is passed,

and the intrusion becomes subject to liability?

2 .As the discussion in _Golden Press_ suggests, courts in a
number of jurisdictions have rejected the absolutist approach of _Pile._
Indeed, counsel for

the defendant in _Pile_ unsuccessfully argued undue hardship
as a reason to withhold the injunction. Exactly how many jurisdictions would
award

injunctive relief against minor building encroachments is
unclear, since some jurisdictions that purport to follow the automatic
injunction rule

nevertheless have recognized a number of exceptions to the
rule (Massachusetts fits this description, see Peters v. Archambault, 278 N.E.
2 d 729 (Mass.

1972 )). A safe generalization would be that, if faced with
the facts of _Pile_ or _Golden Press—_ an unintentional encroachment, only
slight damage to the

plaintiff’s interest, and grave hardship to the defendant if
removal of the encroachment were required—most American courts today would
probably

deny injunctive relief and award only damages.

3 .The doctrinal justification for awarding an injunction is
relatively straightforward, although it is interesting that _Pile_ sees no need
to spell it out.

The building encroachment is a trespass (the only intent
required is to do the act, even if it as a mistake). And failing to remove the
building is a

continuing trespass. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 158
(“One is subject to liability to another for trespass... if he intentionally...
(c) fails to remove

from the land a thing which he is under a duty to remove”);
id. § 161 ( 1 ) (“A trespass may be committed by the continued presence on the
land of a

structure... which the actor tortiously placed there whether
or not the actor has the ability to remove it”). Trespass, as we learned from
_Jacque v.

Steenberg Homes_ , is forbidden without regard to the
reasonableness of the intrusion or whether it causes any actual harm.

4 .The doctrinal justification for the outcome in _Golden
Press_ comes about from viewing the problem from a different angle within the
traditions

of equity. One of the maxims of equity is that an injunction
will issue only if a weighing of interests between the parties—generally called
the “balance

of the equities”—favors giving the victorious plaintiff the
“extraordinary” relief of an injunction rather than damages. What the court
looks for is not a

deviation from equality of hardship, but rather a court will
ask whether a plaintiff who is otherwise eligible to get an injunction should
not get it in light

of the gross hardship to the defendant in comparison with
the benefit to the plaintiff. If the court balances the equities and finds a
disproportionate

hardship on the defendant, it will deny the injunction.
Otherwise, the court will look with favor on the issuance of an injunction. If
the injunction is

denied, the plaintiff will be limited to the relief it would
be entitled to “at law,” i.e., damages. This is the doctrinal path followed by
_Golden Press_ in

deciding that the victorious plaintiff (the encroached-upon
party) will get only damages, rather than an injunction requiring removal of
the encroaching

footings.

5 .Note that the court in _Pile_ does not seem to disagree
with the court in _Golden Press_ about the balance of the equities. One
contested issue in _Pile_

is whether the trial court had authority to divide court
costs between the

```



439



```

parties rather than making the losing defendant pay all the
costs. In exercising this limited discretion in this fashion, the court seems
to signal its

displeasure with the plaintiffs’ extreme and unreasonable
behavior in refusing a license to the defendant to enter onto the plaintiff’s
land to remove the

footings. Why, then, didn’t the court use its equitable
discretion in light of the relative hardships? It is worth noting that
Pennsylvania case law at the

time veered between absolutist statements about trespass and
more lenient approaches. Henry L. McClintock, Discretion to Deny Injunction
against

Trespass and Nuisance, 12 Minn. L. Rev. 565 , 575 – 76 (
1928 ); Comment, Injunction—Nuisance—Balance of Convenience, 37 Yale L.J. 96 ,
97 n. 4

( 1927 ). It is also worth asking what the nature of the
hardship was. If the encroachers could have avoided the problem by bricking up
the windows in the

wall they had built, what exactly was the hardship they
faced?

6 .It bears emphasis that courts have employed the
balancing-of-the-equities approach to deny injunctions against building
encroachments only

when the original encroachment is innocent—that is, when the
encroaching party does not know that the building is encroaching on someone
else’s

property at the time the building is constructed. Courts
frequently refer to a person who violates another’s property rights without
knowing that he or she

is doing so as a “good faith” violator. In contrast, someone
who knowingly violates another’s property rights is called a “bad faith”
violator. (Be aware

that “good faith” and “bad faith” may have slightly
different meanings in other legal contexts, but in property law this is nearly
always the meaning of

these terms.) When an encroacher acts in bad faith at the
time the building is constructed, then the courts universally agree that
injunctive relief against

the encroachment is appropriate. See, e.g., Warsaw v.
Chicago Metallic Ceilings, Chapter IX (upholding injunction requiring
destruction of a warehouse

built with knowledge of a neighbor’s claim that it would
block an easement); Mark L. Share, Principles of Equity Will Not Protect
Encroachers Who

Have Knowingly Invaded Their Neighbors’ Property, L.A. Law.,
Jan. 27 , 2005 , at 40. Does this exception to _Golden Press_ (or perhaps
limitation on the

_Golden Press_ exception to _Pile_ ) follow from the
balancing-of-the-equities maxim, or does it reflect another maxim like the
clean hands requirement? If

the former, why not treat bad faith at the time the building
was constructed as just another factor to weigh in the balance of interests?

7 .Should courts that follow the approach of _Golden Press_
focus only on the encroacher’s actual knowledge at the time the encroaching
structure

was built, or should they also ask whether the encroacher
acted negligently in failing to avoid the encroachment? California has adopted
a Good Faith

Improver Act that requires consideration not only of the
good faith of the encroacher, but also whether the encroacher was negligent,
i.e., failed to

procure a survey or ignored obvious warning signs. See Raab
v. Casper, 124 Cal.Rptr. 590 (Cal. Ct. App. 1975 ) (discussing California Good
Faith

Improver Act as applied to encroaching cabin on adjacent
foothill lot). Does this create better incentives for parties to take
cost-justified precautions to

avoid creating a building encroachment problem? If liability
for encroachments is great enough, it can call forth individually worthwhile
but socially

wasteful efforts at avoiding encroachments through elaborate

```

surveys. See Stewart W. Sterk, Property Rules, Liability
Rules, and Uncertainty about Property Rights, 106 Mich. L. Rev. 1285 ( 2008 ).

8 .A dispute analogous to the issue in _Pile_ and _Golden
Press_ reached the U.S. Supreme Court in the context of intellectual property
rights

(specifically patents). The question was whether the owner
of a patent is automatically entitled to a permanent injunction against a
defendant who has

infringed the patent, or whether courts may sometimes deny
an injunction and award only damages. In _eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C._ ,
547 U.S. 388

( 2006 ), the Court embraced the _Golden Press_ position on
this issue. Injunctive relief may be granted, the Court said, only if the
patent holder can show

that such relief is required by “traditional equitable
principles.” Apparently drawing on the standard for preliminary relief, the
Court set forth a four-part

test the patent holder must satisfy: “( 1 ) that it has
suffered an irreparable injury; ( 2 ) that remedies available at law, such as
monetary damages, are

inadequate to compensate for that injury; ( 3 ) that,
considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a
remedy in equity is

warranted; and ( 4 ) that the public interest would not be
disserved by a permanent injunction.” Id. at 391. The Court did not apply this
test, but remanded

to the lower courts to determine whether an injunction was
appropriate under the circumstances. A concurring opinion by Chief Justice
Roberts, joined

by two other Justices, emphasized that application of the
traditional equitable test will usually result in issuing an injunction, “given
the difficulty of

protecting a right to _exclude_ through monetary remedies
that allow an infringer to _use_ an invention against the patentee’s wishes.”
Id. at 395. Another

concurring opinion by Justice Kennedy, joined by three other
Justices, warned that courts should be wary of issuing injunctions in favor of
firms that

buy up patents to be “employed as a bargaining tool to
charge exorbitant fees to companies that seek to buy licenses to practice the
patent.” Id. at 396.

The four-factor test is spreading to other areas of law, see
Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139 ( 2010 ), and to some state
courts. For

documentation and an argument that this is undesirable as a
matter of history and policy, see Mark Gergen, John M. Golden, & Henry E.
Smith, The

Supreme Court’s Accidental Revolution? The Test for
Permanent Injunctions, 112 Colum. L. Rev. 203 ( 2012 ). As we have already
seen, the traditional

approach to injunctions puts great weight on the good or bad
faith of the rights violator, unlike the four-factor test in _eBay_.

The Ex Ante/Ex Post Problem

Another important consideration in deciding on a remedy is
whether we analyze the situation as it exists before the particular conflict
over

resources arises, or after that conflict arises. Economists
often speak of “ex ante” analysis and “ex post” analysis (this locution has
been picked

up by courts in recent years). Ex ante analysis simply
refers to an analysis of the situation before some critical event like an
accident, or a

contract, or a commitment to a particular use of resources,
takes place. Ex post analysis refers to an analysis of the situation after such
a critical

event occurs. In the context of building encroachments, an
ex ante

#441

analysis would consider the circumstances of two adjacent
landowners, one contemplating a building to be placed near the boundary line

between their properties, before the building is
constructed. Ex post analysis would consider the circumstances of the two
landowners after the

building is constructed. The analysis of both efficiency and
justice may differ dramatically, depending on whether we consider a particular

situation from an ex ante or an ex post perspective.

When we consider the question from an ex ante perspective,
the solution to building encroachments appears to be easy. The neighboring

parties can commission one or more surveys to determine the
exact location of the boundary. If it turns out that the building, as designed,
will

cross the boundary (even if only by a few inches), the
building can be re-designed to eliminate the encroachment. Or, perhaps the
party who

wants to build can strike a deal with the neighbor to buy a
bit of the neighbor’s land to permit the original design to be maintained
without an

encroachment. The tough rule in Pile v. Pedrick can be seen
as maintaining an incentive for anyone contemplating a building close to the

boundary line to be extra careful to avoid an encroachment
and eliminate any problems before construction starts.

Viewed from an ex post perspective, the problem is much more
vexing. Now the cost of maintaining a strong incentive to avoid

encroachments comes at a very high price. The two neighbors
are trapped in a bilateral monopoly situation (Chapter I). The encroached-upon

neighbor can demand that the building be torn down,
producing a huge deadweight loss for the encroacher. The encroacher has no one
else to

turn to who can sell him or her more land to eliminate the
encroachment. Bargaining over the sale of more land is likely to break down,
unless

the encroacher agrees to pay a price that appears to be
“extortionate.”

Given the bilateral monopoly problem that exists in the ex
post situation, and the very real possibility that bargaining will break down
over

a modification of rights, you can see how courts might be
drawn to a solution that limits the encroached-upon party to damages (at least
in cases

of mistake). If the court shifts from Pile v. Pedrick to
Golden Press v. Rylands what will be the measure of damages? Will the joint
wealth of the

parties be greater under this solution than it would be
under an injunction, assuming no post-injunction modification of rights? Will
the outcome

be more just than the one that will likely result if the
court sticks with Pile?

Courts are naturally drawn to ex post analysis because this
is how controversies are presented to them. People typically go to court after
an

accident has happened, a contract has been breached, or a
building encroachment has occurred. The court takes the situation as it is
presented,

and looks for the solution that makes the most sense (is
both efficient and fair) given what has transpired and the circumstances in
which the

parties find themselves. But this does not necessarily mean
that the ex post perspective is the correct perspective for thinking about

#442

such problems. Ex post analysis tends to focus on fairness
and distributional concerns, whereas ex ante analysis is more likely to
consider

incentives for future conduct. Injunctions might be
inefficient from an ex post perspective, and yet still be the more efficient
rule in the long run

—that is, from an ex ante perspective that stresses
incentives for future behavior. We return to this problem in Chapter IX in
considering the

proper remedy for nuisances like continuing pollution from a
plant that has already been built.

NOTE ON MISTAKEN IMPROVERS

_Pile v. Pedrick_ and _Golden Press v. Rylands_ involve
building encroachments that harm the encroached-upon party—or at least provide
no benefit to

the encroached-upon party. But what if the encroacher makes
a whopping big mistake, and constructs a new building entirely on land
belonging to

someone else? (This happens from time to time. Henry E.
Smith, Law and the Big Oops (May 13 , 2015 ), https://blogs. harvard. edu/
nplblog/ 2015 / 05 / 13 /

law-and-the-big-oops/.) Now the mistake cannot clearly be
characterized as causing harm; if anything, it probably confers a benefit on
the landowner.

Under ordinary rules of property law, the building would be
a fixture attached to the land, and hence ownership of the building would
automatically pass

to the owner of the land by accession. (For more on
fixtures, see Chapter II.) Does the mistaken improver nevertheless have any
right to recover for the

benefit conferred on the true owner? Does the mistaken
improver have a privilege to enter the land to remove the building? What if the
landowner does

not like the building, and was planning to do something else
with the land?

These issues presented themselves very colorfully in the
case of _Producers Lumber & Supply Co. v. Olney Building Co._ , 333 S.W. 2
d 619 (Tex. Civ.

App. 1960 ). In that case, H.P. Orts, head of a building
company, had mistakenly built a house on land that his company, Olney Building,
had already

sold to another developer, Producers Lumber, and that was to
be used for a house for its manager Montgomery and his wife. When the mistake
was

discovered—during a title search for financing (see Chapter
VIII)—Orts notified Montgomery and negotiations ensued. Montgomery claimed that
he

didn’t like the house and would up making a lowball offer.
What happened next was the subject of vivid testimony by Orts:

```



Q.Now, you did, on or about April 22 , 1958 , remove those
improvements, did you not? A. That is correct, sir.



Q.Did you notify Mr. Montgomery or anyone from Producers
Lumber and Supply Company that you were going to remove them? A. No,



sir.



Q.How many men do you remember employing on the job of
removal? A. Does this have to be exact, or will an approximation do?



Q.Well, if you know, tell me exactly; otherwise, it has to
be approximately. A. I will say—I am going to say ten.



```

```



443



```

```



Q.Approximately ten? A. Yes.



Q.Isn’t it a fact that you started the removal of these
improvements about 2 : 00 o’clock in the afternoon? A. That is correct, sir.



Q.Isn’t it a fact that by 6 : 00 o’clock in the afternoon,
by the use of a bulldozer and a dozen or more men, you had completely removed



everything but the slab? A. That’s right.



Q.Isn’t it a fact that you made no effort to salvage
anything on the removal? A. No, sir.



Q.You say that is not true? A. No, sir.



```

```



Q.What did you salvage? A. All of the interior partitions,
the exterior partitions, the siding, not the siding, but the exterior sheeting,
the roof



sheeting, electrical and plumbing.



Q.Well, now, actually what happened was that several of your
men went out and tore the roof off, isn’t that right? A. That’s right.



Q.And then you, for lack of a better word I will say
“unjointed”, the corners and then you hooked on with a dozer and dragged the
partitions



and framing and roof trusses across the street, is that
right? A. Partially, that is correct.



Q.You say that is not true? A. Not all of it.



Q.What is not true? A. The side walls were taken down piece
by piece.



Q.The side walls were taken down piece by piece? A. Yes,
sir. * * *



Q.You said that you salvaged the electrical? A. Yes. * * *



Q.Now, who did you employ to remove the slab? A. My
superintendent.



Q.How did Crea Brothers get on the job? A. I hired their
equipment.



Q.What equipment did you hire from Crea Brothers? A. A D- 12
tractor, and I believe that slab was so good they couldn’t get it up with a D-



12 and finally they had to get a crane with a drop hammer,
and I told my superintendent if Crea Brothers didn’t have the—well, frankly, I



don’t know where I got the crane with the drop hammer.



Q.Isn’t it a fact that they also used a couple of air
hammers? A. Oh, yes.



Q.Air hammers, and they had to use torches to cut the steel?
A. That is correct. * * *



Q.So the night you tore that house down, $ 2 , 768. 00 went
down the drain; is that right? A. Yes, sir. My money.



Q.Yes, sir. $ 2 , 768. 00 went up just like that (slapping
hands together)? A. That is right.



```

```



444



```

```



Q.As if you had set a match to it, didn’t it? A. That is
right.



```

333 S.W. 2 d at 622 – 23. The trial court employed special
verdicts, and the jury found (i) that Orts built the house in good faith, (ii)
that it would cost $ 600

to restore the land to its pre-building condition, (iii)
that Orts acted maliciously in removing the building, and (iv) that Producers
should receive $ 300 in

exemplary (punitive) damages. The parties had stipulated
that Lot 8 had a value of $ 5000 and that the house increased the value of the
lot by $ 5000.

Verdicts in hand, the trial judge awarded Producers $ 600
restoration cost. On appeal, the majority held that maliciousness in tearing
down the house

negated any good faith and that Orts had “unclean hands,”
making him ineligible to claim restitution for the benefit he had
(inadvertently) conferred

upon Montgomery. The appeals court awarded not just the $
600 restoration cost but also $ 300 in punitive damages and $ 5000 for the
destroyed house. A

vigorous dissent endorsed the traditional idea of self-help
to remove structures and stressed that Montgomery was obnoxiously taking
advantage of the

situation to obtain a windfall. In deciding which of these
very different views is more persuasive, consider also that if Orts had not
destroyed the

building, the remedial scheme would have been rather
complex, affording Montgomery a choice: (i) he could ask the court to order the
build removed,

(ii) he could pay for the building (restitution to prevent
his unjust enrichment) or allow the land to be subject to a lien in this
amount, see Restatement

Third, Restitution and Unjust Enrichment § 10 ( 2011 ),
(iii) he could require Orts to pay the price for the land in its unimproved
state, or (iv) he could ask

for partition, with the court selling the land and splitting
the proceeds according to the parties’ respective interests. (We take up
partition in Chapter V.)

The basic idea would be for the court to prevent unjust
enrichment but not to unduly disadvantage Montgomery, who did not cause the
problem in the

first place. Of course none of this could happen, because
Orts acted to destroy the house. Is that the problem? Or might Montgomery be
said to have

"abused" his rights—a controversial kind of claim
that comes to the fore in the next case.

### 4 .ABUSE OF RIGHTS

Sometimes equity will intervene when extreme results reflect
what looks to the court like unsavory behavior. In some cases, this will mean

not enforcing a transaction if it works a disproportionate
hardship on a vulnerable party (see the materials on mortgages in Chapter VII
and land

transactions in Chapter VIII). Occasionally a court will use
its power to deny an injunction where a party might be said to be invoking a
right

inconsistently with its purpose.

■
COOLEY, J. This is an injunction bill, and the facts are very simple. Defendant
at a cost of some sixty thousand dollars erected a stamp mill on

the banks of Hill creek in the year 1874, and has since been
operating

#445

it for copper mining purposes. As a result of its operations
large quantities of sand are carried down by the waters of the stream and
deposited on

the bottom lands below. The evidence leads to the belief
that it would be impossible to carry on the mining operations of the defendant
with

profit unless this is permitted. The year following the
erection of defendant’s mill, complainant purchased a piece of land through
which the

creek runs a short distance below the mill, and upon which
the mill as operated was depositing sand. The land was not purchased for use or

occupation, but as a matter of speculation, and apparently
under an expectation of being able to force defendant to buy it at a large
advance on

the purchase price. It was offered to defendant soon after
the purchase, and though no price was named, the valuation which has been put
upon it

by complainant and his witnesses is from three to five times
what it cost him, and this perhaps gives some indication what his expectations
were.

The real value of the land except as a convenience in the
business of defendant would seem to have been small. When defendant declined to

purchase, this bill was filed. The prayer is that defendant
be restrained from running or depositing its stamp sand on complainant’s land,
and from

polluting the waters of the stream by its operations. This
is a short statement of so much of the case as is material to what follows. The
circuit

judge refused the injunction prayed for, but ordered a
reference to a jury for an assessment of damages.

There is no doubt that the operations of defendant, whether
they inflict any serious injury on complainant or not, amount in effect to an

appropriation of that portion of his property upon which
sand is being deposited. It follows and is beyond question that complainant
sustains a

legal injury for which he is entitled to suitable redress.
The only question on this record is, whether he is entitled to the special
redress he seeks,

namely, an injunction.

An injunction is not a process to be lightly ordered in any
case. Where the effect will be to present to the owners of a valuable mill the

alternative either to purchase complainant’s lands at his
own price or to sacrifice their property, any court having the power to order
it ought very

carefully to scrutinize the case and make sure that equity
requires it. In theory its purpose is to prevent irreparable mischief; it stays
an evil the

consequences of which could not adequately be compensated if
it were suffered to go on. The writ “is not ex debito justitiœ, for any injury

threatened or done to the estate or rights of a person, but
the granting of it must always rest in sound discretion, governed by the nature
of the

case.” Enfield Toll Bridge Co. v. Connecticut River Co., 7
Conn. 28, 50 (1828). As is said in another case, “Injunction is not of right
but of grace;

and to move an upright chancellor to interpose this
strongest arm of the law, he must have not a sham case, but a well grounded
complaint, the

bona fides of which is unquestioned, or capable of
vindication if questioned.” Kenton v. Railway Co., 54 Pa. 4 01, 454 (1867).
“There is no

power,” says Mr. Justice Baldwin, “the exercise of which is
more delicate,

#446

which requires greater caution, deliberation and sound
discretion, or is more dangerous in a doubtful case than the issuing of an
injunction. It is

the strong arm of equity, that never ought to be extended
unless to cases of great injury, where courts of law cannot afford an adequate
or

commensurate remedy in damages.” Bonaparte v. Camden &
A.R. Co., 3 F. Cas. 821, 827 (C.C.D.N.J. 1830). All the cases referred to show
that

the court looks beyond the actual injury to contemplate the
consequences, and however palpable may be the wrong, it will still balance the

inconveniences of awarding or denying the writ, and adjudge
as these may incline the judicial mind. Even in the case of a palpable
violation of a

public right to the annoyance of an individual, he must show
the equity which requires this summary interference as the only adequate means
of

obtaining justice.

What is the irreparable injury which is done or threatened
in this case? We can see very plainly what it is in the case of many nuisances,
and

the equity of this particular remedy is then very manifest.
If one man creates intolerable smells near his neighbor’s homestead, or by
excavations

threatens to undermine his house, or cuts off his access to
the street by buildings or ditches, or in any other way destroys the
comfortable,

peaceful and quiet occupation of his homestead, he injures
him irrevocably. No man holds the comfort of his home for sale, and no man is

willing to accept in lieu of it an award of damages. If
equity could not enjoin such a nuisance the writ ought to be dispensed with
altogether, and

the doctrine of irreparable mischief might be dismissed as
meaningless. A nuisance which affects one in his business is less in degree,
but it may

still be irreparable, because it may break up the business,
destroy its good will and inflict damages which are incapable of measurement
because

the elements of reasonable certainty are not to be obtained
for their computation. Even in the case of unoccupied land a nuisance may
threaten

irreparable injury, where it is devoted in its purchase to
some special use, or where the person causing the nuisance is irresponsible,
and in some

other cases which need not here be specially mentioned.

The land injured in this case was bought by the complainant
with a preconceived purpose to force a sale of it upon the defendant. He did
not

want it for a homestead or for business property, but for
the money he could compel the defendant to pay for it. It may be said that no
one is

concerned with the motives of another in making a lawful
purchase, or in doing any other lawful act; and this is true as a rule, but it
is not true

universally. Wherever one keeps within the limits of lawful
action, he is certainly entitled to the protection of the law, whether his
motives are

commendable or not; but if he demands more than the strict
rules of law can give him, his motives may become important. In general it must
be

assumed that the rules of the common law will give adequate
redress for any injury; and when the litigant avers that under the
circumstances of

his particular case they do not, and that therefore the
gracious ear of

#447

equity should incline to hear his complaint, it may not be
amiss to inquire how he came to be placed in such circumstances. If a man
invites an

injury, he may still have his redress in the courts of law,
but his prayer for the special interposition of equity on the ground that what
he invited

and expected was about irreparably to injure, would not be
likely to trouble the judicial conscience very much if it were wholly ignored.

* * * We

cannot say in this case that complainant had no right to
buy, but we can say, as we do, that when he comes demanding strict legal
rights, he shall

have those, but no more. He is entitled to his rights under
the rules of law, but he is entitled to nothing of grace.

The land having been bought to make money from by sale, a
legal award of damages for an injury to it, is in furtherance of the purpose of

the purchase, and therefore a suitable and a just redress.
Defendant is not alleged to be irresponsible, and a jury it is supposed will
award all that

is reasonable. If complainant wants more than is reasonable,
he has a right to obtain it under the rules of law, but he cannot demand the
aid of

equity in a speculation. If in speculative language he has a
corner in real estate, there is no greater reason why he should have the
assistance of an

injunction to aid his schemes than there would be if on the
produce exchange he had effected a corner in grain. Without the writ in either
case he

may be the sufferer, but he suffers nothing for which
damages cannot compensate him. The elements of irreparable injury are entirely
wanting to

his case.

Our conclusion is that the circuit court gave the
complainant all he was entitled to when the case was sent to a jury. The decree
must

therefore be affirmed with costs.

■
CAMPBELL, C.J. It appears without doubt in this case that defendants, without
color or claim of right, are keeping up a continuous series of

invasions upon complainant’s freehold by using a running
stream as a means of transporting sand upon his bottom land in quantities
sufficient to

bury it. The same course of conduct defiles and silts up the
stream, rendering it useless to him for any purpose of business or convenience.
It is

equivalent in mischief to taking away or destroying his
property in the land and his rights in the water.

I cannot concur in the doctrine that any one’s rights of
this kind are subject to judicial discretion. The rights to equitable relief,
where that is

the only adequate remedy, are as absolute as to legal
relief. The one remedy is no more sacred than the other, and no more capable of
lawful

denial. If the defendants were to take possession of the
land in question by putting a tenant upon it, no power would exist any where to
deny

complainant his possessory remedy. Where the same sort of
wrong is done by indirect assumption of possession so that all the advantages
of

actual possession are enjoyed by the wrongdoer without going
in person upon the soil, there is no reason for denying the only remedy which
can

secure to complainant the future enjoyment of his own
estate, which would not as justly authorize the refusal of a possessory remedy
in the

#448

other case. And no remedy at law is adequate for such a
grievance as is here complained of, because no legal remedy can secure
complainant the

use of his own property.

It is not claimed, and there is certainly no ground for
claiming, that there is any equitable estoppel. Defendants have never acted on
any

belief that they had a right to do what they are doing. They
have always known they were wrong-doers, and have simply presumed on the

patience of their neighbors, and neglected to purchase what
they could originally have purchased if they had chosen. Neither does the proof
show

any very serious difficulty in the way of avoiding the
mischief, although I do not regard this as at all essential.

It is not denied by complainant that he purchased for
speculative purposes. As every one has a right to do this if he chooses, it
cannot in any

way lessen his claims to protection. It would be, I think, a
very dangerous principle to hold that a civil wrong can be lessened by the
motives of

the party injured, so long as he has done no wrong himself.
The property of one man is as much entitled to protection as that of
another,—not

because he bought it or intends to use it without selfish
motives, but because it is property. Any attempt to discriminate would, in my
opinion,

leave private interests subject to a discretion which no man
could calculate upon, and make the judicial conscience the only arbiter of
every one’s

rights. Some courts may have acted on this notion, but it
seems to me that such precedents are unjust, and are not consistent with law or
equity as

we have received them under our constitutional guaranties of
protection to person and property.

I think the court below should have granted a perpetual
injunction as prayed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The question of whether one’s rights can be limited by a
wrongful purpose, bad intent, or abuse, is a thorny one in the common law
tradition.

Civil law systems typically feature a doctrine of abuse of
rights, which has many overtones of equity (civil law countries do not have a
history of

separate equity jurisdiction). See, e.g., Anna di Robilant,
Abuse of Rights: The Continental Drug and the Common Law, 61 Hastings L.J. 687
( 2010 );

A.N. Yiannopoulos, Civil Liability for Abuse of Right:
Something Old, Something New.. ., 54 La. L. Rev. 1173 , 1192 – 93 ( 1994 ). In
the common law

countries, courts have veered between two poles. On the one
hand, courts sometimes make strong absolutist statements, along the lines of
the dissent in

the excerpted case, that one can exercise a right for any
reason whatever. See, e.g., Mayor of Bradford v. Pickles, [ 1895 ] A.C. 587
(Eng.) (refusing to

enjoin alleged sham mining operation that polluted city’s
only water supply, and stating that bad motive cannot make unlawful an
otherwise lawful act).

On the other hand, courts will enjoin as nuisances fences
built purely out of spite (Chapter IX) and sometimes intervene in cases like
_Allouez Mining_ ,

leading some to see abuse of right as implicit in the common
law. Joseph M.

72 ( 2015 ).

Is abuse of right the operative notion in _INS v. AP_
(Chapter II)? _Hinman_ (Chapter I)? How about Judge Logan’s dissent in _Edwards
v. Sims_ (Chapter II)?

2 .Is this case actually an application of established
equitable notions? Did the purchaser here have unclean hands? Is there any
sense in which

there is undue hardship for the defendant company? In
another traditional formulation, courts, especially in nuisance cases, would
sometimes deny

injunctions because a plaintiff should not be allowed to
“stand on his extreme rights.” Stevens v. Rockport Granite Co., 104 N.E. 371 ,
373 (Mass. 1914 )

(“The law of nuisance affords no rigid rule to be applied in
all instances. It is elastic. It undertakes to require only that which is fair
and reasonable under

all the circumstances. In a commonwealth like this, which
depends for its material prosperity so largely on the continued growth and
enlargement of

manufacturing of diverse varieties, ‘extreme rights’ cannot
be enforced.”); St. Helen’s Smelting Co. v. Tipping, ( 1865 ) 11 Eng. Rep. 1483
(H.L.). Is that

what is going on here?

3 .Is the problem in cases like _Allouez Mining_ that the
plaintiff was making an “inefficient threat”? Ian Ayres & Kristin Madison,
Threatening

Inefficient Performance of Injunctions and Contracts, 148 U.
Pa. L. Rev. 45 , 50 – 51 ( 1999 ). How should courts identify inefficient
threats? Other

commentators have argued that injunctions should be refused
(and abuse of rights found) when the leverage is illegitimate. Larissa M. Katz,
Spite and

Extortion: A Jurisdictional Principle of Abuse of Right, 122
Yale L.J. 1444 ( 2013 ). How do we define legitimate? If you are tempted to say
that the

plaintiff here is engaging in blackmail, it is noteworthy
that the justification for punishing blackmail has been notoriously difficult
to pin down.

4 .The court in _Allouez Mining_ sees a problem with using
injunctions to support “speculation.” Is there a limiting principle here?
Should specific

performance be unavailable to someone who purchases a
Rembrandt at a garage sale or a plot of land over an oilfield of which the
current owner is

unaware? What if in _Allouez Mining_ the previous owner of
the downstream land had wanted to negotiate but sold to someone who would be
better at

playing hardball with the company? Is there any difference
if the previous owner had simply hired an aggressive lawyer to press the
holdout advantage?

5 .If the lack of development of the damaged tract here is
swaying the court, how robust is the court’s approach? Will future plaintiffs
create a

sham investment or occupancy in order to make themselves
eligible for the injunction and its holdout potential? See Daniel B. Kelly,
Strategic

Spillovers, 111 Colum. L. Rev. 1641 , 1665 – 66 ( 2011 ).
Consider _Van Wagner Advertising Corp. v. S & M Enterprises_ , 492 N.E. 2 d
756 (N.Y. 1986 ),

which involved the lease of outside wall space facing the
Midtown Tunnel in New York City. Noting that the new landlord had missed an
opportunity to

cancel the lease upon the sale and professed to have
different plans for the space, the court held that the plaintiff lessee had an
adequate remedy in

damages and that an injunction would visit disproportionate
hardship on the

```



450



```

breaching landlord, and so denied specific performance. The
lore is it that after the case was over, the landlord leased to another sign
company at a

higher rent.

6 .The problem here also has overtones of “coming to the
nuisance,” which we take up in Chapter IX. Sometimes courts will give
defendants a

break if the plaintiff moved to the nuisance knowing it was
there. Why should this be? Should racing to commit a nuisance first increase
one’s rights?

One would like both parties to act efficiently in light of
the other’s behavior, which turns out to be a complicated problem. Related is
the question of the

statute of limitations. Say a court tells the owner of
vacant land that there is no injury and so no remedy (damages even?) is
appropriate. Then years later

the landowner wants to do something with the land that would
be impacted by the defendant’s activity. Would the landowner lose because of
the statute

of limitations? Either owners of vacant land should be able
to sue or the statute should be tolled. Which is better? See Sturges v.
Bridgman, 11 Ch. D.

852 ( 1879 ) (Eng.); Richard A. Epstein, Nuisance Law:
Corrective Justice and its Utilitarian Constraints, 8 J. Legal Stud. 49 , 72 –
73 ( 1979 ).

### D. OTHER POWERS OF THE SOVEREIGN OWNER

If one thinks of property as a type of sovereignty over
designated things, or perhaps as the power to act as the “gatekeeper” of a
thing, then

it is important not only to be able to exclude other persons
from the thing, but also to be able to include other persons in the use and
enjoyment of

the thing—and perhaps to be able to exclude oneself from the
thing as well. In this Part, we consider a number of basic powers that the
sovereign

owner or gatekeeper typically can exercise beyond the basic
right to exclude others. These include: (1) the power to give permission to
someone

else to gain access to property, generally called a license
; (2) the power to transfer temporary custody of property to someone else,
known (at

least in the context of personal property) as a bailment ;
and (3) the powers to abandon and destroy property. These do not exhaust the
elements of

owner sovereignty, but we will postpone other attributes,
such as the power to determine what happens to property after one’s death and
the

power to transfer, to later chapters.

### 1 .LICENSES

A license can be defined as a permission from an owner of an
asset to another person allowing the latter to gain access to the asset on

certain terms. It is, simply put, a waiver of the owner’s
right to exclude. In general, the term “license” refers to a waiver of the
exclusion right

that is temporary and revocable. A classic example of a
license would be the owner’s permission to a repair person to enter an
apartment to fix a

broken dishwasher. If the repair person fails to make the
repairs properly, or otherwise misbehaves, the owner can revoke the license and
ask him

to leave. It is also possible to waive the exclusion right
by

#451

granting someone an interest of greater permanence and
security than a license, the most common examples being easements and leases.
These

more secure and permanent waivers are often called “property
rights,” and are distinguished from “mere licenses,” but as always one must

proceed with care in understanding what exactly is meant by
these terms in this context.

```

---

■
ALDERSON, B. This was an action tried before my Brother Rolfe at the sittings
after last Trinity Term. It was an action for an assault and false

imprisonment. The plea (on which alone any question arose)
was, that at the time of the alleged trespass the plaintiff was in a certain
close of

Lord Eglintoun, and the defendant, as the servant of Lord
Eglintoun, and by his command, laid his hands upon the plaintiff in order to
remove

him from the said close, using no unnecessary violence.
Replication, that, at the time of such removal, the plaintiff was in the said
close by the

leave and license of Lord Eglintoun. The leave and license
was traversed by the defendant, and issue was joined on that traverse. On the
trial it

appeared that the place from which the plaintiff was removed
by the defendant was the inclosure attached to and surrounding the great stand
on

the Doncaster race-course; that Lord Eglintoun was steward
of the races there in the year 1843; that tickets were sold in the town of
Doncaster at

one guinea each, which were understood to entitle the
holders to come into the stand, and the inclosure surrounding it, and to remain
there every

day during the races. These tickets were not signed by Lord
Eglintoun, but it must be assumed that they were issued with his privity. It
further

appeared, that the plaintiff, having purchased one of these
tickets, came to the stand during the races of the year 1843, and was there or
in the

inclosure while the races were going on, and while there,
and during the races, the defendant, by the order of Lord Eglintoun, desired
him to

depart, and gave him notice that if he did not go away,
force would be used to turn him out. It must be assumed that the plaintiff had
in no respect

misconducted himself, and that, if he had not been required
to depart, his coming upon and remaining in the inclosure would have been an
act

justified by his purchase of the ticket. The plaintiff
refused to go, and thereupon the defendant, by order of Lord Eglintoun, forced
him out,

without returning the guinea, using no unnecessary violence.

My Brother Rolfe, in directing the jury, told them, that,
even assuming the ticket to have been sold to the plaintiff under the sanction
of Lord

Eglintoun, still it was lawful for Lord Eglintoun, without
returning the guinea, and without assigning any reason for what he did, to
order the

plaintiff to quit the inclosure, and that, if the jury were

#452

satisfied that notice was given by Lord Eglintoun to the
plaintiff, requiring him to quit the ground, and that, before he was forcibly
removed by

the defendant, a reasonable time had elapsed, during which
he might conveniently have gone away, then the plaintiff was not, at the time
of the

removal, on the place in question by the leave and license
of Lord Eglintoun. On this direction the jury found a verdict for the
defendant. In last

Michaelmas term, Mr. Jervis obtained a rule nisi to set
aside the verdict for misdirection, on the ground, that, under the
circumstances, Lord

Eglintoun must be taken to have given the plaintiff leave to
come into and remain in the inclosure during the races; that such leave was not

revocable, at all events without returning the guinea; and
so that, as [of] the time of the removal, the plaintiff was in the inclosure by
the leave

and license of Lord Eglintoun. Cause was shewn during last
term, and the question was argued before my Brothers Parke and Rolfe and
myself;

and on account of the conflicting authorities cited in the
argument, we took time to consider our judgment, which we are now prepared to
deliver.

---

That no incorporeal inheritance affecting land can either be
created or transferred otherwise than by deed, is a proposition so well

established, that it would be mere pedantry to cite
authorities in its support. All such inheritances are said emphatically to lie
in grant, and not in

livery [of seisin], and to pass by mere delivering of the
deed. In all the authorities and text-books on the subject, a deed is always
stated or

assumed to be indispensably requisite.

And although the older authorities speak of incorporeal
inheritances, there is no doubt but that the principle does not depend on the
quality

of interest granted or transferred, but on the nature of the
subject-matter: a right of common, for instance, which is a profit à prendre,
or a right of

way, which is an easement, or right in nature of an
easement, can no more be granted or conveyed for life or for years without a
deed, than in fee

simple. Now, in the present case, the right claimed by the
plaintiff is a right, during a portion of each day, for a limited number of
days, to pass

into and through and to remain in a certain close belonging
to Lord Eglintoun; to go and remain where if he went and remained, he would,
but

for the ticket, be a trespasser. This is a right affecting
land at least as obviously and extensively as a right of way over the land,—it
is a right of

way and something more: and if we had to decide this case on
general principles only, and independently of authority, it would appear to us

perfectly clear that no such right can be created otherwise
than by deed. The plaintiff, however, in this case argues, that he is not
driven to claim

the right in question strictly as grantee. He contends,
that, without any grant from Lord Eglintoun, he had license from him to be in
the close in

question at the time when he was turned out, and that such
license was, under the circumstances, irrevocable. * * *

#453

[I]t may be convenient to consider the nature of a license,
and what are its legal incidents. And, for this purpose, we cannot do better
than

refer to Lord C. J. Vaughan’s elaborate judgment in the case
of Thomas v. Sorrell , as it appears in his Reports [(1685) Vaughan 330, 124
Eng.

Rep. 1098 (C.P.)]. The question there was as to the right of
the Crown to dispense with certain statutes regulating the sale of wine, and to
license

the Vintners’ Company to do certain acts notwithstanding
those statutes.

In the course of his judgment the Chief Justice says
(Vaughan, 351[, 124 Eng. Rep. at 1109]), “A dispensation or license properly
passeth no

interest, nor alters or transfers property in anything, but
only makes an action lawful, which without it had been unlawful. As a license
to go

beyond the seas, to hunt in a man’s park, to come into his
house, are only actions which, without license, had been unlawful. But a
license to hunt

in a man’s park, and carry away the deer killed to his own
use; to cut down a tree in a man’s ground, and to carry it away the next day
after to his

own use, are licenses as to the acts of hunting and cutting
down the tree, but as to the carrying away of the deer killed and tree cut
down, they are

grants. So, to license a man to eat my meat, or to fire the
wood in my chimney to warm him by, as to the actions of eating, firing my wood,
and

warming him, they are licenses; but it is consequent
necessarily to those actions that my property may be destroyed in the meat
eaten, and in the

wood burnt. So as in some cases, by consequent and not
directly, and as its effect, a dispensation or license may destroy and alter
property.”

Now, attending to this passage, in conjunction with the
title “License” in Brooke’s Abridgment, from which, and particularly from

paragraph 1 5, it appears that a license is in its nature
revocable, we have before us the whole principle of the law on this subject. A
mere license

is revocable: but that which is called a license is often
something more than a license; it often comprises or is connected with a grant,
and then

the party who has given it cannot in general revoke it, so
as to defeat his grant, to which it was incident.

It may further be observed, that a license under seal
(provided it be a mere license) is as revocable as a license by parol; and, on
the other

hand, a license by parol, coupled with a grant, is as
irrevocable as a license by deed, provided only that the grant is of a nature
capable of being

made by parol. But where there is a license by parol,
coupled with a parol grant, or pretended grant, of something which is incapable
of being

granted otherwise than by deed, there the license is a mere
license; it is not an incident to a valid grant, and it is therefore revocable.
Thus, a

license by A. to hunt in his park, whether given by deed or
by parol, is revocable; it merely renders the act of hunting lawful, which,
without the

license, would have been unlawful. If the license be, as put
by Chief Justice Vaughan, a license not only to hunt, but also to take away the
deer

when killed to his own use, this is in truth a grant of the
deer, with a license annexed to come on the land: and supposing the grant of
the

#454

deer to be good, then the license would be irrevocable by
the party who had given it; he would be estopped from defeating his own grant,
or act

in the nature of a grant. * * *

It was suggested that, in the present case, a distinction
might exist, by reason of the plaintiff’s having paid a valuable consideration
for the

privilege of going on the stand. But this fact makes no
difference: whether it may give the plaintiff a right of action against those
from whom he

purchased the ticket, or those who authorized its being
issued and sold to him, is a point not necessary to be discussed; any such
action would be

founded on a breach of contract, and would not be the result
of his having acquired by the ticket a right of going upon the stand, in spite
of the

owner of the soil; and it is sufficient, on this point, to
say, that in several of the cases we have cited, * * * the alleged license had
been granted for

a valuable consideration, but that was not held to make any
difference. * * *

In conclusion, we have only to say, that, acting upon the
doctrine relative to licenses * * * the direction given to the jury at the
trial was

correct, and that this rule must be discharged.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Let us unpack some of the vocabulary in the case. An
“incorporeal inheritance” (or “incorporeal hereditament”) refers to a
nonpossessory

property right that descends on death in accordance with the
rules for real property. Easements, such as a right to cross another’s land,
are a principal

example. A profit à prendre (or “profit” for short)—a right
to gather resources like timber or game on another’s land—is another example.
“Incorporeal”

is a misnomer here, because the rights in question are not
intangible (like intellectual property), but are simply use rights in land
amounting to something

less than full possession. “Livery of seisin” refers to the
traditional

```



455



```

ceremony used in feudal times to transfer freehold interests
in real property (more on this in Chapter V). Easements and profits were not
transferred by

livery of seisin, but by deed. A “deed” was traditionally a
sealed writing, the seal being a stamp impressed on the paper using melted wax.
Today, deeds

no longer require hot wax, but often entail formalities like
signatures that are witnessed or notarized. The court’s point about all this is
that a license is

typically created orally (“by parol”) or by contract, in
contrast to property rights like easements and profits, which are created by
deed.

2 .The rule enunciated by Baron Alderson, that a “mere
license” to enter the land of another is always revocable, remains black letter
law. The

reason for the rule remains elusive in Baron Alderson’s
opinion. He seems to suggest that the reason is purely formal: property rights
to enter the land of

another (incorporeal inheritances like easements and
profits) must be created by deed, and once created they are irrevocable for
their stated term. If there

is no deed, however, the interest is a mere license. But
this, of course, just tells us how one creates a property right that is
irrevocable as opposed to a

license. It does not explain why creating a mere license is
always revocable. Later in the opinion, Baron Alderson acknowledges that
sometimes licenses

are in fact also irrevocable. Specifically, a license
“coupled with a grant” is irrevocable until such a time as the purpose of the
grant is fulfilled. To use

his example, if A orally agrees that B can enter A’s land to
kill and take away a deer, B has an implied license to enter the land for this
purpose and the

license is irrevocable until the grant is fulfilled or is
revoked. Note that neither the license nor the grant in the example is created
by deed. So a deed is

not always required to create an irrevocable license.

3 .In a later U.S. decision, _Marrone v. Washington Jockey
Club of the District of Columbia_ , 227 U.S. 633 , 636 ( 1913 ), a patron sued
a racetrack for

forcibly removing him and for conspiring to ruin his
reputation by accusing him of drugging a horse. Because proof of the conspiracy
to defame was

lacking, Justice Holmes treated the case a matter of
revocation of the license. He followed the rule in _Wood v. Leadbitter_ , which
he described as having

established that tickets to enter a race track “do not
create a right _in rem._ ” He grounded this in the presumed intentions of the
parties: “The ticket was not

a conveyance of an interest in the race track, not only
because it was not under seal, but because by common understanding it did not
purport to have

that effect. There would be obvious inconveniences if it
were construed otherwise.” Id. Holmes was clearly right that a ticket to view a
single sporting

event (or movie or play) is not understood to convey “an
interest in the race track.” (What about a season ticket or a skybox rental?)
Does it follow,

however, that the parties do not intend that the license
will be irrevocable until the race (or the movie or play) is over? When people
purchase a ticket to

a horse race, a movie, or a play, don’t they usually think
they have a right to stay until the performance is over?

4 .The result in _Wood v. Leadbitter_ has been regarded as
unjust by many commentators because Wood entered into a contract with Lord
Eglintoun

(or his agent) for the right to enter the grounds and watch
the races, and he paid a handsome sum of money (a guinea was worth more than a
pound

sterling) to be allowed to do so. No reason is offered in
the opinion

```



456



```

for Lord Eglintoun’s subsequent decision to revoke the
license and have his servant Leadbitter evict Wood. Recent research reveals,
that, as in _Marrone_ ,

problems surrounding the horse betting industry formed the
backdrop to _Wood_ as well. In the 1840 s in England, horse racing had acquired
a bad

reputation, and Lord Eglintoun was among those trying to
clean things up. Leadbitter was an ex-policeman hired to prevent shady
activities. Plaintiff

Wood was a notoriously crooked bookmaker, who had defaulted
on a fraudulent bet. Wood couldn’t sue for defamation because he was a
defaulter, so he

sued for assault and false imprisonment instead. If Wood had
won, the racing business faced the prospect of hostile legislation. At the
trial, much bad

character evidence came in against Wood, after which the
trial judge told the jury it was irrelevant. Patrick Polden, A Day at the
Races: _Wood v.

Leadbitter_ in Context, 14 J. Legal Hist. 28 ( 1993 ). Does
this backstory show that the ability to revoke the license without
justification is important for

business landowners? Or does it suggest that they should be
forced to state their real reasons?

5 .Does the exception recognized in _Wood_ for licenses
coupled with a grant apply to the ticket to view the Doncaster races? In a
later English

decision that declined to follow _Wood_ —at least with
respect to contracts to view a spectacle like a movie—some of the judges
suggested that such a

contract is in effect a license coupled with a grant,
namely, “the right to see.” Hurst v. Picture Theatres, Ltd., [ 1915 ] 1 K.B. 1
(C.A. 1914 ) (Buckley,

L.J.). A grant is commonly understood to be a conveyance of
a property right. _Wood_ confirms that permission to hunt deer is a grant of
any deer killed in

the hunt, and that such a grant entails an implied license
to enter the land. A dead deer is personal property. But is the “right to see”
a property right? If

so, what kind?

6 .Is the understanding that licenses are always revocable
(at least “mere licenses”) consistent with the idea that property owners have
broad

sovereign authority to manage and control their thing? The
rule means that an owner does not give up the right to exclude by making
informal promises

to neighbors or friends or even by entering into contracts
with service providers or patrons. If things do not work out as anticipated,
the owner can

reassert the sovereign prerogative to exclude and maintain
control over the thing. The owner gives up control over the thing only if a
full-fledged

property right is transferred to another, such as an
easement, a profit, or a lease, and this requires a conveyance accompanied by
formalities that impress

upon the owner the irrevocable nature of the action being
taken. This can also be seen as a manifestation of the idea that exceptions to
full-fledged

property rights exist only in a limited number of defined
forms—the _numerus clausus_ idea discussed more fully in Chapter V. If a
variety of promises

and contracts could give rise to irrevocable licenses, in
effect this would permit a proliferation of property forms, which would greatly
complicate the

system of property rights.

7 .Lawsuits by ticket holders who have been expelled from
sporting events or theaters are not common, perhaps because “theater
proprietors can

be trusted not to expel their patrons unjustifiably.” Alfred
F. Conard, An Analysis of Licenses in Land, 42 Colum. L. Rev. 809 , 823 ( 1942
). More

```

```

common are suits by ticket holders who are disgruntled by
what they see once they get there. These too generally fail. In one case, a New
York Jets fan

sued the coach of the New England Patriots for secretly
videotaping signals being sent from the sidelines to the Jets’ huddle. Mayer v.
Belichick, 605

F. 3 d 223 ( 3 d. Cir. 2010 ). Citing _Wood v. Leadbitter_ ,
the court held that “a ticket provides a patron with nothing more than a
revocable license” id. at 231 ,

and does not guarantee that the ticket holder will “see an
‘honest’ game played in compliance with the rules of the NFL.” Id. at 233.

Equitable Enforcement of Licenses

Can the exceptions to the rule that licenses are always
revocable be explained on grounds of equity? Recall that courts of equity will

sometimes modify the ordinary rules associated with property
in circumstances where they would produce an injustice. For example, although

the action for trespass to land originally provided only for
damages, courts of equity came to issue injunctions against defendants who
commit

repeated trespasses ( Baker v. Howard County Hunt ).
Similarly, although a permanent trespass in the form of a building encroachment
might

ordinarily call for an injunction requiring that the
encroachment be removed, courts of equity sometimes limit the encroached-upon
owner to an

award of damages when the mistake is unintentional and harm
trivial ( Golden Press v. Rylands ).

The exception to the usual rule of revocability for licenses
“coupled with a grant,” discussed in Wood v. Leadbitter , can also be explained
on

grounds of equity. If A grants B the right to hunt and kill
deer on A’s land, and B, acting in reliance on this grant, hunts and kills a
deer, it would

seem unjust to allow A at that point to revoke the license,
in effect depriving B of realizing the purpose of the grant (and depriving B of
the fruits

of his labor). A court of law, following the understanding
that licenses are always revocable, might deny B relief. But if B brought a
suit in a

court of equity, one might expect the equity court to issue
an order enjoining A from revoking the license until B has been given an
opportunity

to remove the deer. In effect, the equity court would
interpose an in personam order directing A to desist from exercising A’s
ordinary legal right

to revoke the license, until the purpose of A’s grant to B
had been realized. Once the deer is removed, the injunction would lapse and A’s
ordinary

right to exclude would be restored.

Principles of equity can also explain another exception to
the ordinary rule that licenses are always revocable, which we consider more
fully

in Chapter IX. This is where A grants a license to B, and B,
acting in reliance on the license and with the knowledge of A, materially
changes his

position in such a way that it would be inequitable to allow
A to revoke the license. To take a classic case, Rerick v. Kern , 14 Serg.
& Rawle 267

(Pa. 1 826), suppose that A gives oral permission to B to
change the course of a stream that flows through the land of both A and B. B,
in reliance

on this permission, builds an expensive water mill on the
new

#458

watercourse on B’s land. A then changes his mind, and
demands that the stream be restored to its original course. Allowing A to
revoke the

permission to divert the stream would impose a very great
hardship on B, and courts of equity have issued injunctions in these
circumstances

barring persons like A from revoking the license for as long
as such hardship would result, for example, until the mill is abandoned or can
be

powered by some other source.

Can principles of equity be used to challenge the result in
Wood v. Leadbitter? The question was debated at length in the decision by the

English Court of Appeal in Hurst v. Picture Theatres, Ltd. ,
[1915] 1 K.B. 1. The plaintiff, Hurst, purchased a ticket to view a motion
picture in a

theater in London. He gave his ticket to an usher and took
his seat, but the management of the theater evidently suspected that he had
entered

without paying. He was asked to leave and refused, whereupon
he was ejected. Hurst sued for assault and false imprisonment. The jury found
for

Hurst on the question whether he had paid, and he was
awarded £150 in damages (a very large sum at the time). The appeals court, over
a

dissent, declined to follow Wood v. Leadbitter and affirmed.

One argument for not following Wood was that Parliament in
the Judicature Act of 1873 had merged the courts of law and equity, allowing

courts of law to rely on principles of equity in resolving
disputes. Wood had been decided by a court of law before the merger of law and
equity,

and hence had no choice but to follow the legal rule that
licenses are always revocable. Why would a court of equity decide Wood
differently?

The judges in the majority in Hurst reasoned that a person
who purchases a ticket to see a spectacle (like a movie or a horse race)
acquires a

contractual right. An implied term of the contract is that
the license to enter the venue will not be revoked until the spectacle is over.
Because the

spectacle is unique (this seems true in the case of a horse
race; perhaps not for a movie?), a court of equity would grant specific
performance of

the contract, in effect enjoining the proprietor from
revoking the license until the spectacle is over. Since the proprietor could be
enjoined from

revoking the license, an attempt by the proprietor to eject
the patron is an illegal assault, actionable in tort.

Can you detect the flaw in this reasoning? Judge Phillimore
stated in his dissent: “Assume... that there was a contract, and assume that
the

purported revocation was a breach of the contract, and
assume that of which I am not certain, that equity would give specific
performance of

such a contract, still specific performance does not
necessarily put the man before he has got specific performance in the legal
possession which

he gets after he has got specific performance.” [1915] 1
K.B. at 18. Remember, equity assesses the equities of the particular case, and
if the

plaintiff is successful, the equity court issues a personal
order directing the defendant to desist or perform particular acts, on pain of
contempt.

Often it is not possible to predict how the court will rule
until it has gathered and considered all the relevant facts. In some
contractual

#459

disputes, it will still be possible after all the facts have
been considered to order specific performance; for example, it may still be
possible to

order the defendant to complete a sale of land to the
plaintiff. But in the case of a dispute over whether a particular patron is
entitled to see a

particular entertainment, it will be impossible (in
virtually every case) to seek and secure an award of specific performance
before the spectacle is

over. To allow a patron to resist eviction based on a
prediction of what would happen if, contrary to fact, a court of equity could
hear and resolve

the dispute before the performance is over, would seem to
invite disorder and possible violence in entertainment venues. As Justice
Holmes

stated in a similar dispute in a characteristically cryptic
fashion: Even if a ticket creates a right enforceable against the proprietor,
the ticket

holder has “no right to enforce specific performance by
self-help.” Marrone v. Washington Jockey Club of the District of Columbia, 227
U.S.

633, 636 (1913). Does this help explain why Wood , rather
than Hurst , continues to be regarded as good law by most American
jurisdictions?

United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, 1996.



86 F. 3 d 1447.

■
EASTERBROOK, CIRCUIT JUDGE. Must buyers of computer software obey the terms of
shrinkwrap licenses? The district court held not, for two

reasons: first, they are not contracts because the licenses
are inside the box rather than printed on the outside; second, federal law
forbids

enforcement even if the licenses are contracts. The parties
and numerous amici curiae have briefed many other issues, but these are the
only two

that matter—and we disagree with the district judge’s
conclusion on each. Shrinkwrap licenses are enforceable unless their terms are

objectionable on grounds applicable to contracts in general
(for example, if they violate a rule of positive law, or if they are
unconscionable).

Because no one argues that the terms of the license at issue
here are troublesome, we remand with instructions to enter judgment for the
plaintiff.

I

ProCD, the plaintiff, has compiled information from more
than 3,000 telephone directories into a computer database. We may assume that

this database cannot be copyrighted, although it is more
complex, contains more information (nine-digit zip codes and census industrial
codes), is

organized differently, and therefore is more original than
the single alphabetical directory at issue in Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural
Telephone

Service Co. , 499 U.S. 340 (1991). See Paul J. Heald, The
Vices of Originality, 1991 Sup.Ct. Rev. 143, 160–68. ProCD sells a version of
the

database, called SelectPhone (trademark), on CD-ROM discs.
(CD-ROM means “compact disc—read only memory.” The “shrinkwrap license”

gets its name from the fact that retail software packages
are covered in plastic or cellophane “shrinkwrap,” and some vendors, though

#460

not ProCD, have written licenses that become effective as
soon as the customer tears the wrapping from the package. Vendors prefer “end
user

license,” but we use the more common term.) A proprietary
method of compressing the data serves as effective encryption too. Customers

decrypt and use the data with the aid of an application
program that ProCD has written. This program, which is copyrighted, searches
the

database in response to users’ criteria (such as “find all
people named Tatum in Tennessee, plus all firms with ‘Door Systems’ in the
corporate

name”). The resulting lists (or, as ProCD prefers,
“listings”) can be read and manipulated by other software, such as word
processing programs.

The database in SelectPhone (trademark) cost more than $10
million to compile and is expensive to keep current. It is much more valuable

to some users than to others. The combination of names,
addresses, and SIC [Standard Industrial Classification] codes enables
manufacturers to

compile lists of potential customers. Manufacturers and
retailers pay high prices to specialized information intermediaries for such
mailing lists;

ProCD offers a potentially cheaper alternative. People with
nothing to sell could use the database as a substitute for calling long
distance

information, or as a way to look up old friends who have
moved to unknown towns, or just as an electronic substitute for the local phone
book.

ProCD decided to engage in price discrimination, selling its
database to the general public for personal use at a low price (approximately
$150

for the set of five discs) while selling information to the
trade for a higher price. It has adopted some intermediate strategies too:
access to the

SelectPhone (trademark) database is available via the
America Online service for the price America Online charges to its clients
(approximately

$3 per hour), but this service has been tailored to be
useful only to the general public.

If ProCD had to recover all of its costs and make a profit
by charging a single price—that is, if it could not charge more to commercial
users

than to the general public—it would have to raise the price
substantially over $150. The ensuing reduction in sales would harm consumers
who

value the information at, say, $200. They get consumer
surplus of $50 under the current arrangement but would cease to buy if the
price rose

substantially. If because of high elasticity of demand in
the consumer segment of the market the only way to make a profit turned out to
be a

price attractive to commercial users alone, then all
consumers would lose out—and so would the commercial clients, who would have to
pay

more for the listings because ProCD could not obtain any
contribution toward costs from the consumer market.

To make price discrimination work, however, the seller must
be able to control arbitrage. An air carrier sells tickets for less to
vacationers

than to business travelers, using advance purchase and
Saturday-night-stay requirements to distinguish the categories. A producer of
movies

segments the market by time, releasing first to theaters,
then to pay-per-view services, next to the videotape and laserdisc market, and
finally to

#461

cable and commercial tv. Vendors of computer software have a
harder task. Anyone can walk into a retail store and buy a box. Customers do
not

wear tags saying “commercial user” or “consumer user.”
Anyway, even a commercial-user-detector at the door would not work, because a

consumer could buy the software and resell to a commercial
user. That arbitrage would break down the price discrimination and drive up the

minimum price at which ProCD would sell to anyone.

Instead of tinkering with the product and letting users sort
themselves—for example, furnishing current data at a high price that would be

attractive only to commercial customers, and two-year-old
data at a low price—ProCD turned to the institution of contract. Every box
containing

its consumer product declares that the software comes with
restrictions stated in an enclosed license. This license, which is encoded on
the CD-

ROM disks as well as printed in the manual, and which
appears on a user’s screen every time the software runs, limits use of the
application

program and listings to non-commercial purposes.

Matthew Zeidenberg bought a consumer package of SelectPhone
(trademark) in 1994 from a retail outlet in Madison, Wisconsin, but

decided to ignore the license. He formed Silken Mountain Web
Services, Inc., to resell the information in the SelectPhone (trademark)
database.

The corporation makes the database available on the Internet
to anyone willing to pay its price—which, needless to say, is less than ProCD

charges its commercial customers. Zeidenberg has purchased
two additional SelectPhone (trademark) packages, each with an updated version
of

the database, and made the latest information available over
the World Wide Web, for a price, through his corporation. ProCD filed this suit

seeking an injunction against further dissemination that
exceeds the rights specified in the licenses (identical in each of the three
packages

Zeidenberg purchased). The district court held the licenses
ineffectual because their terms do not appear on the outside of the packages.
The court

added that the second and third licenses stand no different
from the first, even though they are identical, because they might have been
different,

and a purchaser does not agree to—and cannot be bound
by—terms that were secret at the time of purchase.

II

Following the district court, we treat the licenses as
ordinary contracts accompanying the sale of products, and therefore as governed
by the

common law of contracts and the Uniform Commercial Code.
Whether there are legal differences between “contracts” and “licenses” (which

may matter under the copyright doctrine of first sale) is a
subject for another day. See Microsoft Corp. v. Harmony Computers &
Electronics,

Inc., 846 F.Supp. 208 (E.D.N.Y. 1994). * * * Zeidenberg
[argues], and the district court held, that placing the package of software on
the shelf is

an “offer,” which the customer “accepts” by paying the
asking price and leaving the store with the goods. Peeters v. State, 142 N.W.
181 (Wis.

1913). In Wisconsin, as elsewhere, a contract includes

#462

only the terms on which the parties have agreed. One cannot
agree to hidden terms, the judge concluded. So far, so good—but one of the
terms to

which Zeidenberg agreed by purchasing the software is that
the transaction was subject to a license. Zeidenberg’s position therefore must
be that

the printed terms on the outside of a box are the parties’
contract—except for printed terms that refer to or incorporate other terms. But
why

would Wisconsin fetter the parties’ choice in this way?
Vendors can put the entire terms of a contract on the outside of a box only by
using

microscopic type, removing other information that buyers
might find more useful (such as what the software does, and on which computers
it

works), or both. The “Read Me” file included with most
software, describing system requirements and potential incompatibilities, may
be

equivalent to ten pages of type; warranties and license
restrictions take still more space. Notice on the outside, terms on the inside,
and a right to

return the software for a refund if the terms are
unacceptable (a right that the license expressly extends), may be a means of
doing business

valuable to buyers and sellers alike. See E. Allan
Farnsworth, 1 Farnsworth on Contracts § 4.26 (1990); Restatement (2d) of
Contracts § 211

comment a (1981) (“Standardization of agreements serves many
of the same functions as standardization of goods and services; both are

essential to a system of mass production and distribution.
Scarce and costly time and skill can be devoted to a class of transactions
rather than the

details of individual transactions.”). Doubtless a state
could forbid the use of standard contracts in the software business, but we do
not think that

Wisconsin has done so.

Transactions in which the exchange of money precedes the
communication of detailed terms are common. * * * [C]onsider the purchase of

an airline ticket. The traveler calls the carrier or an
agent, is quoted a price, reserves a seat, pays, and gets a ticket, in that
order. The ticket

contains elaborate terms, which the traveler can reject by
canceling the reservation. To use the ticket is to accept the terms, even terms
that in

retrospect are disadvantageous. See Carnival Cruise Lines,
Inc. v. Shute, 499 U.S. 585 (1991). Just so with a ticket to a concert. The
back of the

ticket states that the patron promises not to record the
concert; to attend is to agree. A theater that detects a violation will
confiscate the tape and

escort the violator to the exit. One could arrange things so
that every concertgoer signs this promise before forking over the money, but
that

cumbersome way of doing things not only would lengthen
queues and raise prices but also would scotch the sale of tickets by phone or
electronic

data service. * * *

III

The district court held that, even if Wisconsin treats
shrinkwrap licenses as contracts, § 3 01(a) of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §
301(a),

prevents their enforcement. The relevant part of § 301(a)
preempts any “legal or equitable rights [under state law] that are equivalent
to any of

the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright
as specified by

#463

section 106 in works of authorship that are fixed in a
tangible medium of expression and come within the subject matter of copyright
as specified

by sections 102 and 103.” ProCD’s software and data are
“fixed in a tangible medium of expression”, and the district judge held that
they are

“within the subject matter of copyright”. The latter
conclusion is plainly right for the copyrighted application program, and the
judge thought that

the data likewise are “within the subject matter of
copyright” even if, after Feist , they are not sufficiently original to be
copyrighted. One

function of § 301 (a) is to prevent states from giving
special protection to works of authorship that Congress has decided should be
in the public

domain, which it can accomplish only if “subject matter of
copyright” includes all works of a type covered by sections 102 and 103, even
if

federal law does not afford protection to them. Cf. Bonito
Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141 (1989) (same principle
under

patent laws).

But are rights created by contract “equivalent to any of the
exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright”? Three courts of
appeals

have answered “no.” National Car Rental System, Inc. v.
Computer Associates International, Inc., 991 F.2d 426, 433 (8th Cir. 1993);
Taquino v.

Teledyne Monarch Rubber, 893 F.2d 1488, 1501 (5th Cir.
1990); Acorn Structures, Inc. v. Swantz, 846 F.2d 923, 926 (4th Cir. 1988). The
district

court disagreed with these decisions, but we think them
sound. Rights “equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general
scope of

copyright” are rights established by law —rights that
restrict the options of persons who are strangers to the author. Copyright law
forbids

duplication, public performance, and so on, unless the
person wishing to copy or perform the work gets permission; silence means a ban
on

copying. A copyright is a right against the world.
Contracts, by contrast, generally affect only their parties; strangers may do
as they please, so

contracts do not create “exclusive rights.” Someone who
found a copy of SelectPhone (trademark) on the street would not be affected by
the

shrinkwrap license—though the federal copyright laws of
their own force would limit the finder’s ability to copy or transmit the
application

program.

Think for a moment about * * * everyday transactions in
intellectual property. A customer visits a video store and rents a copy of
Night of

the Lepus. The customer’s contract with the store limits use
of the tape to home viewing and requires its return in two days. May the
customer

keep the tape, on the ground that § 301(a) makes the promise
unenforceable?

A law student uses the LEXIS database, containing
public-domain documents, under a contract limiting the results to educational

endeavors; may the student resell his access to this
database to a law firm from which LEXIS seeks to collect a much higher hourly
rate? * * *

Everyone remains free to copy and disseminate all 3,000
telephone books that have been incorporated into ProCD’s database. Anyone can
add

SIC codes and zip codes. ProCD’s rivals have done so.
Enforcement of the

#464

shrinkwrap license may even make information more readily
available, by reducing the price ProCD charges to consumer buyers. * * *
Licenses

may have other benefits for consumers: many licenses permit
users to make extra copies, to use the software on multiple computers, even to

incorporate the software into the user’s products. But
whether a particular license is generous or restrictive, a simple two-party
contract is not

“equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the
general scope of copyright” and therefore may be enforced.

REVERSED AND REMANDED.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .As _ProCD_ suggests, license agreements are extremely
important in the world of intellectual property. Judge Easterbrook says that
there may be

some differences between licenses and contracts, but he
leaves that for another day, and proceeds to treat a software license exactly
like a contract.

Indeed many IP licenses are created by contract. And yet
despite the tendency to equate licenses and contracts, there are good reasons
not to confuse the

two. Christopher M. Newman, A License is Not a ‘Contract Not
to Sue’: Disentangling Property and Contract in the Law of Copyright Licenses,
98

Iowa L. Rev. 1101 ( 2013 ). Contexts in which seeing a
license as a waiver of a property right rather than a contract include licenses
enforceable without

consideration and licenses to be enforced against a
transferee of the copyright.

2 .Courts’ acceptance of shrinkwrap licenses has carried
over into the more recent clickwrap licenses (under which clicking a button or
icon with a

mouse constitutes acceptance) and browsewrap licenses (in
which browsing past the counterparty’s homepage effects acceptance). Woodrow
Hartzog,

Website Design as Contract, 60 Am. U. L. Rev. 1635 , 1642 –
45 ( 2011 ). The use of licenses with intellectual property goes far beyond
computer software.

Consider, for example, the agreements by which firms like
McDonald’s or Coca-Cola license franchisees and distributors to use their
trademarks and

trade names, or by which the producers of commercial movies
license the distribution of videos and DVDs made from the movie, or by which
the

owners of patents license producing firms to use the
patented inventions in furnishing various products and services.

3 .Suppose the software is protected by a patent, having a
term ending 20 years from the date of the filing of the patent application. The

shrinkwrap license, which everyone who buys the software
must agree to, provides that the purchaser promises not to allow anyone else to
use the

software, without the patent owner’s express written
permission, for 40 years. Has the device of the shrinkwrap license here been
used effectively to

amend the scope of monopoly protection given by the patent
laws? The Supreme Court has made confusing pronouncements on this subject.
Compare

Brulotte v. Thys Co., 379 U.S. 29 ( 1964 ) (holding that the
Patent Act preempts enforcement of a contract providing for royalties that
continue to accrue

after the last of the patents incorporated into the machines
in question expired) with Aronson v. Quick Point Pencil Co., 440 U.S. 257 (
1979 ) (no

preemption where agreement

```



465



```

provided for reduced royalty in the event that inventor
failed to get a patent). What is the difference between a property right to
information, which binds

the whole world, and a shrinkwrap license, which attempts to
bind everyone who uses the information?

4 .Some have expressed dismay at the degree of control that
content providers can achieve through contractual restrictions and various

technological measures, collectively known as Digital Rights
Management, such as built-in software that automatically terminates access
after a number

of uses or after a set period of time. In what sense do
these devices “propertize” information? Compare Julie E. Cohen, DRM and
Privacy, 18 Berkeley

Tech. L.J. 575 ( 2003 ); Dan Burk & Julie Cohen, Fair
Use Infrastructure for Rights Management Systems, 15 Harv. J.L. & Tech. 41
( 2001 ) with David

Friedman, In Defense of Private Orderings: Comments on Julie
Cohen’s “Copyright and the Jurisprudence of Self-Help”, 13 Berkeley Tech. L.J.
1151

( 1998 ).

5 .What if, in Judge Easterbrook’s hypothetical about the
software that someone dropped and someone else picked up off the sidewalk, one
has to

click past an agreement screen every time one launches the
program? If consideration is the problem, assume that every time the agreement
page is

clicked a small payment is transferred via the internet to
the software provider. In what sense is the contract right in such a situation
different from an in

rem property right?

6 .The rise of cyberspace has led to some creative uses of
licenses. Consider “virtual worlds,” in which people, through online characters
called

“avatars,” can take various actions, interact with others,
and acquire “virtual property.” Typically, the hosts of the game hold
intellectual property rights

in the game and claim to be merely licensing use by the game
participants. How would you characterize the legal relationship between game
hosts and

gamers? Should there be limits to what game owners can do
with licenses? For the many issues raised by “virtual property” and their
implications for

actual property, see, e.g., Juliet M. Moringiello, What
Virtual Worlds Can Do for Property Law, 62 Fla. L. Rev. 159 ( 2010 ); James
Grimmelmann,

Virtual Worlds as Comparative Law, 49 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev.
147 , 148 – 58 ( 2004 ); João Marinotti, Tangibility as Technology, 37 Ga. St.
L. Rev. 671

( 2021 ). Can one use licenses to in effect create a
synthetic bundle of sticks, thereby bypassing all the requirements of property
law? See Aaron

Perzanowski & Jason Schultz, The End of Ownership ( 2016
).

### 2 .BAILMENTS

A bailment arises when the owner of property (the bailor)
temporarily transfers custody of the property to another (the bailee). Usually
a

bailment is created by a contract, express or implied, and
the parties have some special purpose in mind that requires the transfer of
possession of

particular property; after this purpose is accomplished, it
is understood that the property will be returned to the owner (the bailor).
Familiar

examples of bailments include the transfer of clothing to a
dry cleaning shop for cleaning, the transfer of securities to a broker for

#466

safekeeping, or the transfer of an automobile to a valet for
parking. Because the bailment relationship is usually created by contract, the

respective rights and duties of the bailor and bailee have a
strong contractual element, and can be modified by agreement of the parties.
But

because the essence of the bailment contract is the transfer
of possession of property, some of the bailor’s rights associated with
ownership—

most notably the right to exclude others from the owned
thing—are also transferred to the bailee. Thus, insofar as third parties are
concerned, the

bailee’s rights with respect to the thing are similar to
those of an owner. This blending of contractual (in personam) and property (in
rem)

elements makes for some difficult and interesting
complications in bailment law. Restatement (Fourth) of Property, Vol. 3, § 1
(Am. L. Inst.

2021).

#### Allen v. Hyatt Regency-Nashville Hotel

```



Supreme Court of Tennessee, 1984.



668 S.W. 2 d 286.



```

■
HARBISON, JUSTICE. In this case the Court is asked to consider the nature and
extent of the liability of the operator of a commercial parking

garage for theft of a vehicle during the absence of the
owner. Both courts below, on the basis of prior decisions from this state, held
that a

bailment was created when the owner parked and locked his
vehicle in a modern, indoor, multi-story garage operated by appellant in
conjunction

with a large hotel in downtown Nashville. We affirm.

There is almost no dispute as to the relevant facts.
Appellant is the owner and operator of a modern high-rise hotel in Nashville
fronting on

the south side of Union Street. Immediately to the rear, or
south, of the main hotel building there is a multi-story parking garage with a
single

entrance and a single exit to the west, on Seventh Avenue,
North. As one enters the parking garage at the street level, there is a large
sign reading

“Welcome to Hyatt Regency-Nashville.” There is another Hyatt
Regency sign inside the garage at street level, together with a sign marked

“Parking.” The garage is available for parking by members of
the general public as well as guests of the hotel, and the public are invited
to utilize

it.

On the morning of February 12, 1981, appellee’s husband,
Edwin Allen, accompanied by two passengers, drove appellee’s new 1981

automobile into the parking garage. Neither Mr. Allen nor
his passengers intended to register at the hotel as a guest. Mr. Allen had
parked in this

particular garage on several occasions, however, testifying
that he felt that the vehicle would be safer in an attended garage than in an
unattended

outside lot on the street.

The single entrance was controlled by a ticket machine. The
single exit was controlled by an attendant in a booth just opposite to the

entrance and in full view thereof. Appellee’s husband
entered the garage

#467

at the street level and took a ticket which was
automatically dispensed by the machine. The machine activated a barrier gate
which rose and

permitted Mr. Allen to enter the garage. He drove to the
fourth floor level, parked the vehicle, locked it, retained the ignition key,
descended by

elevator to the street level and left the garage. When he
returned several hours later, the car was gone, and it has never been
recovered. Mr. Allen

reported the theft to the attendant at the exit booth, who
stated, “Well, it didn’t come out here.” The attendant did not testify at the
trial.

Mr. Allen then reported the theft to security personnel
employed by appellant, and subsequently reported the loss to the police.
Appellant

regularly employed a number of security guards, who were
dressed in a distinctive uniform, two of whom were on duty most of the time.
These

guards patrolled the hotel grounds and building as well as
the garage and were instructed to make rounds through the garage, although not

necessarily at specified intervals. One of the security
guards told appellee’s husband that earlier in the day he had received the
following report:

He said, “It’s a funny thing here. On my report here a lady
called me somewhere around nine-thirty or after and said that there was

someone messing with a car.”

The guard told Mr. Allen that he closed his office and went
up into the garage to investigate, but reported that he did not find anything

unusual or out of the ordinary.

Customers such as Mr. Allen, upon entering the garage,
received a ticket from the dispensing machine. On one side of this ticket are

instructions to overnight guests to present the ticket to
the front desk of the hotel. The other side contains instructions to the parker
to keep the

ticket and that the ticket must be presented to the cashier
upon leaving the parking area. The ticket states that charges are made for the
use of

parking space only and that appellant assumes no
responsibility for loss through fire, theft, collision or otherwise to the car
or its contents. The

ticket states that cars are parked at the risk of the owner,
and parkers are instructed to lock their vehicles.^1 The record indicates that
these tickets

are given solely for the purpose of measuring the time
during which a vehicle is parked in order that the attendant may collect the
proper charge,

and that they are not given for the purpose of identifying
particular vehicles.

The question of the legal relationship between the operator
of a vehicle which is being parked and the operator of parking establishments

has been the subject of frequent litigation in this state
and elsewhere. The authorities are in conflict, and the results of the cases
are varied.^2

#468

It is legally and theoretically possible, of course, for
various legal relationships to be created by the parties, ranging from the
traditional

concepts of lessor-lessee, licensor-licensee, bailor-bailee,
to that described in some jurisdictions as a “deposit.”^3 Several courts have
found

difficulty with the traditional criteria of bailment in
analyzing park-and-lock cases. One of the leading cases is McGlynn v. Parking
Authority of

City of Newark, 432 A.2d 99 (N.J. 1981). There the Supreme
Court of New Jersey reviewed numerous decisions from within its own state and

from other jurisdictions, and it concluded that it was more
“useful and straightforward” to consider the possession and control elements in

defining the duty of care of a garage operator to its
customers than to consider them in the context of bailment. That Court
concluded that the

“realities” of the relationship between the parties gave
rise to a duty of reasonable care on the part of operators of parking garages
and parking

lots. It further found that a garage owner is usually better
situated to protect a parked car and to distribute the cost of protection
through parking

fees. It also emphasized that owners usually expect to
receive their vehicles back in the same condition in which they left them and
that the

imposition of a duty to protect parked vehicles and their
contents was consistent with that expectation. The Court went further and
stated that

since the owner is ordinarily absent when theft or damage
occurs, the obligation to come forward with affirmative evidence of negligence
could

impose a difficult, if not insurmountable, burden upon him.
After considering various policy considerations, which it acknowledged to be
the

same as those recognized by courts holding that a bailment
is created, the New Jersey Court indulged or authorized a presumption of
negligence

from proof of damage to a car parked in an enclosed garage.

Although the New Jersey Court concluded that a more flexible
and comprehensive approach could be achieved outside of traditional

property concepts, Tennessee courts generally have analyzed
cases such as this in terms of sufficiency of the evidence to create a bailment
for

hire by implication. We believe that this continues to be
the majority view and the most satisfactory and realistic approach to the
problem, unless

the parties clearly by their conduct or by express contract
create some other relationship.

The subject has been discussed in numerous previous
decisions in this state. One of the leading cases is Dispeker v. New Southern
Hotel

Co. , 373 S.W.2d 904 (Tenn. 1963). In that case the guest at
a hotel delivered his vehicle to a bellboy who took possession of it and parked
it in a

lot adjoining the hotel building. The owner kept the keys,
but the car apparently was capable of being started without the ignition key.
The owner

apparently had told the attendant how to so operate it.
Later the employee took the vehicle for his own purposes and damaged it. Under
these

circumstances the Court held that a bailment for hire had
been

#469

created and that upon proof of misdelivery of the vehicle
the bailee was liable to the customer.

In the subsequent case of Scruggs v. Dennis , 440 S.W.2d 20
(Tenn. 1969), upon facts practically identical to those of the instant case,
the

Court again held that an implied bailment contract had been
created between a customer who parked and locked his vehicle in a garage. Upon

entry he received a ticket dispensed by a machine, drove his
automobile to the underground third level of the garage and parked. He retained
his

ignition key, but when he returned to retrieve the
automobile in the afternoon it had disappeared. It was recovered more than two
weeks later and

returned to the owner in a damaged condition.

In that case the operator of the garage had several
attendants on duty, but the attendants did not ordinarily operate the parked
vehicles, as in

the instant case.^5

Although the Court recognized that there were some factual
differences between the Scruggs case and that of Dispeker v. New Southern

Hotel Co ., supra, it concluded that a bailment had been
created when the owner parked his vehicle for custody and safe keeping in the
parking

garage, where there was limited access and where the patron
had to present a ticket to an attendant upon leaving the premises. * * *

On the contrary, in the case of Rhodes v. Pioneer Parking
Lot, Inc. , 501 S.W.2d 569 (Tenn. 1973), a bailment was found not to exist when

the owner left his vehicle in an open parking lot which was
wholly unattended and where he simply inserted coins into a meter, received a
ticket,

then parked the vehicle himself and locked it.

Denying recovery, the Court said:

In the case at bar, however, we find no evidence to justify
a finding that the plaintiff delivered his car into the custody of the
defendant,

nor do we find any act or conduct upon the defendant’s part
which would justify a reasonable person believing that an obligation of

bailment had been assumed by the defendant.

501 S.W.2d at 571.

In the instant case, appellee’s vehicle was not driven into
an unattended or open parking area. Rather it was driven into an enclosed,
indoor,

attended commercial garage which not only had an attendant
controlling the exit but regular security personnel to patrol the premises for
safety.

Under these facts we are of the opinion that the courts
below correctly concluded that a bailment for hire had been created, and that
upon

proof of nondelivery appellee was entitled to the statutory
presumption of negligence provided in T.C.A. § 24–5–1 1 1.

#470

We recognize that there is always a question as to whether
there has been sufficient delivery of possession and control to create a
bailment

when the owner locks a vehicle and keeps the keys.
Nevertheless, the realities of the situation are that the operator of the
garage is, in

circumstances like those shown in this record, expected to
provide attendants and protection. In practicality the operator does assume
control and

custody of the vehicles parked, limiting access thereto and
requiring the presentation of a ticket upon exit. As stated previously, the
attendant

employed by appellant did not testify, but he told
appellee’s husband that the vehicle did not come out of the garage through the
exit which he

controlled. This testimony was not amplified, but the
attendant obviously must have been in error or else must have been inattentive
or away

from his station. The record clearly shows that there was no
other exit from which the vehicle could have been driven.

Appellant made no effort to rebut the presumption created by
statute in this state (which is similar to presumptions indulged by courts in

some other jurisdictions not having such statutes). While
the plaintiff did not prove positive acts of negligence on the part of
appellant, the record

does show that some improper activity or tampering with
vehicles had been called to the attention of security personnel earlier in the
day of the

theft in question, and that appellee’s new vehicle had been
removed from the garage by some person or persons unknown, either driving past
an

inattentive attendant or one who had absented himself from
his post, there being simply no other way in which the vehicle could have been

driven out of the garage.

Under the facts and circumstances of this case, we are not
inclined to depart from prior decisions or to place the risk of loss upon the

consuming public as against the operators of commercial
parking establishments such as that conducted by appellant. We recognize that
park-

and-lock situations arise under many and varied factual
circumstances. It is difficult to lay down one rule of law which will apply to
all cases.

The expectations of the parties and their conduct can cause
differing legal relationships to arise, with consequent different legal
results. We do

not find the facts of the present case, however, to be at
variance with the legal requirements of the traditional concept of a bailment
for hire. In

our opinion it amounted to more than a mere license or
hiring of a space to park a vehicle, unaccompanied by any expectation of
protection or

other obligation upon the operator of the establishment.

The judgment of the courts below is affirmed at the cost of
appellant. The cause will be remanded to the trial court for any further

proceedings which may be necessary.

■
DROWOTA, J., dissenting. * * * Even though some courts now suggest that the
theory of bailment is an archaic and inappropriate theory upon

which to base liability in modern park and lock cases, the
majority opinion states that “Tennessee courts generally have analyzed cases
such as

this in terms of sufficiency of the evidence to create a
bailment for hire

#471

by implication,” and concludes that this is “the most
satisfactory and realistic approach to the problem.” I do not disagree with the
longstanding

use of the bailment analysis in this type of case. I do
disagree, however, with the majority’s conclusion that a bailment for hire has
been created

in this case.

The record shows that upon entering this parking garage a
ticket, showing time of entry, is automatically dispensed by a machine. The
ticket

states that charges are made for the use of a parking space
only and that the garage assumes no responsibility for loss to the car or its
contents.

The ticket further states that cars are parked at the risk
of the owner, and parkers are instructed to lock their vehicles. The majority
opinion points

out that it is not insisted that this language on the ticket
is sufficient to exonerate the garage, since the customer is not shown to have
read it or to

have had it called to his attention. Savoy Hotel Corp. v.
Sparks, 421 S.W.2d 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1967). The ticket in no way identifies
the vehicle,

it is given solely for the purpose of measuring the length
of time during which the vehicle is parked in order that a proper charge may be
made.

In this case Mr. Allen, without any direction or
supervision, parked his car, removed his keys, and locked the car and left the
parking garage

having retained his ignition key. The presentation of a
ticket upon exit is for the sole purpose of allowing the cashier to collect the
proper charge.

The cashier is not required to be on duty at all times. When
no cashier is present, the exit gate is opened and no payment is required.^1 As
the

majority opinion states, the ticket is “not given for the
purpose of identifying particular vehicles.” The ticket functioned solely as a
source of fee

computation, not of vehicle identification.

The majority opinion states: “[W]e do not find the facts of
the present case to be at variance with the legal requirements of the concept
of a

bailment for hire.” I must disagree, for I feel the facts of
the present case are clearly at variance with what I consider to be the legal
requirements

of the traditional concept of a bailment for hire.

Bailment has been defined by this Court in the following
manner:

The creation of a bailment in the absence of an express
contract requires that possession and control over the subject matter pass

from the bailor to the bailee. In order to constitute a
sufficient delivery of the subject matter there must be a full transfer, either
actual

or constructive, of the property to the bailee so as to
exclude it from the possession of the owner and all other persons and give to
the

bailee, for the time being, the sole custody and control
thereof. See Jackson v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville, supra, Scruggs

v. Dennis, 440 S.W.2d

#472

20 (Tenn. 1969); Old Hickory Parking Corp. v. Alloway, 177
S.W.2d 23 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1944). See generally, 8 Am.Jur.2d 960–61.

In parking lot and parking garage situations, a bailment is
created where the operator of the lot or garage has knowingly and

voluntarily assumed control, possession, or custody of the
motor vehicle; if he has not done so, there may be a mere license to park or

a lease of parking space. See, e.g., Lewis v. Ebersole, 12
So.2d 543 (Ala. 1943); Southeastern Fair Association v. Ford, 14 S.E.2d 139

(Ga. Ct. App. 1941).

Rhodes v. Pioneer Parking Lot, Inc., 501 S.W.2d 569, 570
(Tenn. 1973).

From its earliest origins, the most distinguishing factor
identifying a bailment has been delivery. Our earliest decisions also recognize

acceptance as a necessary factor, requiring that possession
and control of the property pass from bailor to bailee, to the exclusion of
control by

others. The test thus becomes whether the operator of the
vehicle has made such a delivery to the operator of the parking facility as to
amount to

a relinquishment of his exclusive possession, control, and
dominion over the vehicle so that the latter can exclude it from the possession
of all

others. If so, a bailment has been created.

When the automobile began replacing the horse and buggy, our
courts allowed bailment law to carry over and govern the parking of

vehicles. * * * [C]ases involving parking attendants and
personalized service have caused us no problems. The problem arises in this
modern era

of automated parking, when courts have attempted to expand
the limits of existing areas of the law to encompass technological and
commercial

advances. Such is the case of Scruggs v. Dennis , 440 S.W.2d
20 (Tenn. 1969), relied upon in the majority opinion. In Scruggs , as in this
case, the

entire operation is automated, with the exception of payment
upon departure. The operation bears little, if any, resemblance to the
circumstances

found in Old Hickory Parking Corp ., Savoy Hotel , and
Dispeker. Yet the Court in Scruggs , in quoting extensively from the Dispeker
opinion,

states that “There are some minute differences of fact... .”
Id., 440 S.W.2d at 22. As pointed out above, the differences of fact in
Dispeker are

not minute or so similar as the Scruggs court would suggest.
Delivery, custody and control are clearly present in Dispeker. I fail to find
such

delivery, custody and control in Scruggs or in the case at
bar. In Dispeker , the vehicle was actually taken from the owner by an
attendant. I

believe the Scruggs court and the majority opinion today
attempt to apply bailment law in situations where there is not a true bailment

relationship. * * *

The majority opinion, as did the Scruggs court, finds
custody and control implied because of the limited access and because “the

presentation of a ticket upon exit” is required. I cannot
agree with this analysis as creating a bailment situation. I do not believe
that based upon

the fact that a ticket was required to be presented upon
leaving, that this

#473

factor created a proper basis upon which to find a bailment
relationship. The ticket did not identify the vehicle or the operator of the
vehicle, as

do most bailment receipts. The cashier was not performing
the traditional bailee role or identifying and returning a particular article,
but instead

was merely computing the amount owed and accepting payment
due for use of a parking space. I do not believe the Defendant exercised such

possession and control over Plaintiff’s automobile as is
necessary in an implied bailment. * * *

Plaintiff parked his car, locked it and retained the key.
Certainly Defendant cannot be said to have sole custody of Plaintiff’s vehicle,
for

Defendant could not move it, did not know to whom it
belonged, and did not know when it would be reclaimed or by whom. Anyone who

manually obtained a ticket from the dispenser could drive
out with any vehicle he was capable of operating. Also, a cashier was not
always on

duty. When on duty, so long as the parking fee was paid—by
what means could the Defendant reasonably exercise control? The necessary

delivery and relinquishment of control by the Plaintiff, the
very basis upon which the bailment theory was developed, is missing.

We should realize that the circumstances upon which the
principles of bailment law were established and developed are not always

applicable to the operation of the modern day automated
parking facility. The element of delivery, of sole custody and control are
lacking in this

case.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .As _Allen_ illustrates, many activities in modern life
involve more than one category of property relationship—in this case, the
Allens and the

hotel have entered into both a license agreement and
(perhaps) a bailment agreement. As in the present case, selecting the proper
category with which to

analyze the case can have a pronounced influence on the
outcome. There are no fixed rules for deciding which rubric is correct. It is
mostly a matter of

“fit,” which is determined by looking at all the
circumstances and the way similar cases have been categorized in the past. Did
the court perform the

classificatory analysis correctly in this case, based on the
prior decisions the opinions discuss?

2 .Why not resolve all these disputes by contract? Note that
no one seems to take the language printed on the ticket in this case
seriously—in

contrast to the court in _ProCD_ , which upheld the detailed
provisions in the shrinkwrap license against various claims that it should not
be binding. The

problem with using contract to determine the rights and
duties associated with various daily events like parking a car, checking a
coat, dropping off

clothing at the dry cleaners, and so forth is that few
people have time to “shop around” and compare the various disclaimers or
guarantees that bailees

are offering about risk of loss and other potential casualty
events. A typical consumer will remain “rationally ignorant” of these details,
because the

value of the bailed item, discounted by the probability of a
theft or accident occurring, does not warrant spending much if any time
comparing different

standard-form-contract offerings. Of course, consumers may
rely on other

```



474



```

clues about the bailee, such as past experience with the
bailee, the bailee’s reputation in the community, or whether the bailee has a
prominent brand

name. But even so, there remains a case for imposing a
degree of standardization on these relationships through “property” rules that
are either

nondisclaimable or that can be disclaimed only through very
prominent disclosure. If you think standardization makes sense, who should do
the

standardizing? The courts, through episodic common-law
rulings as in the present case? A regulatory agency established for this
purpose? A trade

association of bailees?

3 .If the Hyatt Regency in Nashville wants to modify the
outcome in this case by contract, so that it does not face liability for auto
theft in the

future, what would you advise it to do?

The Bailee’s Duty of Care

One longstanding matter of doctrinal controversy has been
the duty of care that the bailee owes to the bailor. Suppose, for example, that
the

property is lost, stolen, or destroyed while in the custody
of the bailee. By what standard do we determine whether the bailee is liable to
the

bailor for the value of the property that was the subject of
the bailment?

The early common law apparently took the position that the
bailee’s liability to the bailor for lost, stolen, or destroyed goods was
absolute.

This was perhaps based on the understanding that the
contract between the bailor and bailee called for the return of the goods when
the purpose

of the bailment was realized, and if the bailee failed to
return the good, the bailee had violated the parties’ understanding. But this
rule seemed

harsh in many circumstances, and so in Coggs v. Bernard , 92
Eng. Rep. 107 (K.B. 1703), Chief Justice Holt undertook to restate the law. His

restatement, which was borrowed from the thirteenth-century
writer Bracton, who in return borrowed from the Romans, consisted of a

complicated six-fold classification of bailments, with
different standards of care for each. Few traces of this effort remain today.
More influential

was Justice Story’s effort in his treatise on bailments,
which offered a more simplified set of rules:

When the bailment is for the sole benefit of the bailor, the
law requires only slight diligence on the part of the bailee, and of course

makes him answerable only for gross neglect. When the
bailment is for the sole benefit of the bailee, the law requires great
diligence

on the part of the bailee, and makes him responsible for
slight neglect. When the bailment is reciprocally beneficial to both parties,
the

law requires ordinary diligence on the part of the bailee,
and makes him responsible for ordinary neglect.

Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Law of Bailments § 3, at
27 (9th ed. 1878).

More recently, commentators have urged even greater
simplification, advocating a universal standard of “reasonable care” for

#475

all bailments. See Kurt Philip Autor, Note, Bailment
Liability: Toward a Standard of Reasonable Care, 61 S. Cal. L. Rev. 2117
(1988). In

determining whether the bailee exercised reasonable care,
such a standard would take into account all the circumstances surrounding the

bailment relationship, including whether the bailee received
compensation or whether the bailment was for the benefit of the bailee. A
survey of

modern bailment cases undertaken by Professor Helmholz,
however, casts doubt on whether courts in fact apply such a uniform standard of

reasonable care. R.H. Helmholz, Bailment Theories and the
Liability of Bailees: The Elusive Uniform Standard of Reasonable Care, 41 Kan.
L.

Rev. 97 (1992). Recent surveys confirm this. See 9 Cal. Jur.
3d Bailments § 28 (updated 2022) (California continues to have a shifting
standard

of care depending on the type of bailment); 46 Am. Jur.
Proof of Facts 3d 361, § 5 (updated 2022) (standard of care depends on the

circumstances and varies from slight, to ordinary, to great
care).

One complication is that since the relationship between the
bailor and bailee is a contractual one, the standard of care can be modified by

agreement between the parties before the bailment commences.
Attempts to do this are quite common, as when restaurants post signs in coat

check rooms disclaiming any liability for items left there,
or, as in the Allen case, a parking garage prints a disclaimer of liability on
the back of

the parking ticket dispensed by machine upon entry. Whether
these efforts at modifying the standard of care are successful is open to
question.

Another complication is that courts seem to be stricter
about bailees who misdeliver goods—that is, when they turn the goods over to

someone other than the true owner—than they are when the
goods are lost, stolen, or destroyed while being held in the custody of the
bailee for

return to the true owner. Consider, in this light, the
following case.

■
MULLAN, J. Conversion, for the defendants’ alleged wrongful delivery of a bond.
The parties on both sides are stock exchange brokers.

Plaintiffs had agreed to sell and deliver to defendants a
bond of the Oregon Short Line Railroad of the par value of $1,000. To fill that
order,

plaintiffs ordered the bond from a third bond house, and the
latter, by mistake, sent plaintiffs an Oregon & California Railroad bond,
and

plaintiffs, also by mistake, sent this Oregon &
California bond to defendants. There is no controversy as to the manner of the
sending. Plaintiffs

handed the Oregon & California bond to Goldberg, a youth
of 17 years, who was one of plaintiffs’ two messengers, or “runners,” as they
seem to

be called. With the bond was a memorandum (also called
“slip” or “statement”) briefly describing an Oregon Short Line bond. The bond
and slip

were inclosed together in an envelope. Goldberg took the
envelope to defendants’ place

#476

of business in a Wall Street office building. Defendants’
suite of offices had two entrance doors from the office building hall, one for
general use,

and the other for persons, such as Goldberg, making
deliveries. Goldberg entered at the latter door, and was then in a tiny outside
room,

described as about two feet by six feet. There was no door
for passage between this small outside room and an inside, and presumably
larger,

room. Deliveries were made by dropping papers in a slot in
one of the partitions partly forming this small outer room. Above the slot was
a

window of opaque glass that swung inwards. That window was
kept closed unless or until the person acting for defendants at the delivery

window should desire to talk to one making a delivery, when
he would open the window. Next to the partition containing that slot and
window,

and in the inner room, was a desk at which was kept seated
either a member of defendants’ firm or a clerk. At the time here in question
there

were two persons at that desk, Mr. Quackenbush, of the
defendants’ firm, and an employee, one Campbell.

Goldberg dropped the envelope through the slot. His
testimony was:

I waited until he [the person at the desk] took it in, and
then I left. * * * I told him I will call back for a check. Q. Why didn’t you
ask

for the receipt? A. Well, I was in a hurry; I had many
deliveries that day, and I had to make them. * * * Q. How long would you say

you were in that delivery room in front of that delivery
window—from the time you put the bond in until you left? A. It was from a

minute to a minute and a half.

Goldberg could not recall whether the person at the other
side of the window said anything. He thought, but was not sure, that there was

“somebody” else in the little outside room when he was
there. It does not appear from Goldberg’s testimony whether or not the delivery
window

was open during any part of his stay while making the
delivery. Mr. Quackenbush testified as follows:

Q.Will you tell us what took place at the time of that
delivery. A. It was about 10:30 in the morning. Mr. Campbell and myself stood

there making up our loans, when a bond shoots through the
window like a streak of lightning; it goes right down my desk—that was

my desk about the width of this table (indicating
stenographer’s table)—right down in front of us. As it rolls over, I opened it
up; just

pulled the bond open that way instantly (indicating). The
statement called for an Oregon Short Line five bond; I could see immediately

that the bond was an Oregon & California, and we handle
thousands of them. Q. What did you do then? A. I immediately opened the

window. Q. Where was that; right in front of you? A. Right
like that (indicating), and I yelled “Cowen.” A young man steps right up,

and I says, “Make your statement agree with the bond.” The
Court: Sir? The Witness: “Make your statement agree with the bond.” He

mumbled, “Alright,” and takes the bond and goes out

#477

immediately like that. Q. And he took it? A. He took it. Q.
When you say man ___ A. A young boy 19 or 20 years old. Q. What did

you do then; close the window? A. Closed the window; went
about my work. Q. You were expecting from Cowen & Co. at that time a

Short Line bond, were you not? A. Yes; we had purchased one,
looking for it. Q. You were looking for it? A. Yes; some day. Q. And

you say you instantly found it was not ___ A. It was not
more than 15 seconds. Q. And you were under no contract to purchase from

Cowen & Co. a California bond? A. No, sir. Q. How long
would you say it took between the time that bond came into your slot on to

your desk and the time you opened the window and yelled
“Cowen”? A. Not a second more than 15. Q. Fifteen seconds? A. Not a

second more than that. Q. When you opened the window where
did the boy come? A. To my left from the main door. Q. You heard the

Goldberg boy testify, did you not, that when he put that
bond into your window, he waited about a minute and a half; is that correct? A.

I will say no. Q. Did you hear him say anything? A. Nothing.
Q. The only thing you know is seeing the bond shoot into the window. A.

Exactly. Q. Was there a receipt on that bond to be signed by
you? A. No, sir; it was not. Q. It was merely a sale memorandum? A.

Exactly. Q. Neither one of them is the young man to whom you
delivered the bond? A. No, sir. Q. You delivered the bond to some one

else? A. Neither one of those [plaintiffs’] boys.

Mr. Campbell substantially corroborated Mr. Quackenbush’s
version.

Concededly the boy to whom Quackenbush returned the bond
delivered by Goldberg was not Goldberg, but some unidentified boy who

made away with the bond. The bond was of the bearer type,
fully negotiable.

The defendants have refused to make good the plaintiffs’
loss, contending that they were chargeable only with due diligence, and that,

accepting the version of the plaintiffs as given by
Goldberg, it appears that they exercised all the care required of them. The
plaintiffs contend

that there was an absolute obligation on the part of the
defendants to redeliver the bond to the plaintiffs, and that no question of
negligence enters

into the case. They also argue that, if the negligence
question does enter, there was sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that
the defendants

did not, in fact, exercise due care. The learned trial judge
did not state the ground of his decision in plaintiffs’ favor.

A person who has been put, through no act or fault of his
own, in such a situation as that in which the defendants were put upon the
delivery

to them of the wrong bond, has come to be known as
“involuntary bailee” * * * or constructive or quasi bailee.

In the field of voluntary bailments, whether they be for
hire or be otherwise coupled with an interest on the part of the bailee, or
whether

#478

they be merely gratuitous, no rule is better settled than
that it is the duty of the bailee to deliver the bailed article to the right
person, and that

delivery to the wrong person is not capable of being excused
by any possible showing of care or good faith or innocence.

Such distinctions as have been drawn between the duties of
voluntary bailees for compensation and voluntary gratuitous bailees relate

solely to the degree of care the bailee should exercise in
respect of the custody of the thing bailed. In respect of delivery to the
proper person, no

such distinction is drawn; the duty in both cases is
absolute.

What, then, is the difference, if any, between the duty of a
voluntary gratuitous bailee and that of a wholly involuntary bailee? There is
an

astonishing paucity of decision and text opinion upon the
subject. I think, however, that all that can be found upon it points to the
conclusion that

the involuntary bailee, as long as his lack of volition
continues, is not under the slightest duty to care for or guard the subject of
the bailment, and

cannot be held, in respect of custody, for what would even
be the grossest negligence in the case of a voluntary bailment, but that, in
case the

involuntary bailee shall exercise any dominion over the
thing so bailed, he becomes as responsible as if he were a voluntary bailee. *

I have reached the conclusion that while, at first blush, it
may seem to be imposing upon the defendants an unduly severe rule of conduct to

hold them to an absolute liability, the rule is no more
severe than the occasion calls for. * * * The defendants could easily have
protected

themselves by telephoning the plaintiffs that the wrong bond
had been delivered, or they could have sent the bond back to the plaintiffs by
one of

their own messengers. Instead, they chose to take chance of
delivering it to the wrong messenger. As the delivery window was closed when
the

bond was dropped through the slot, and remained closed for
an appreciable time, they could not have known what messenger had made the

delivery. * * *

The plaintiffs, as has already been mentioned, urge that, if
the defendants are not to be held in conversion, they are, at least, liable in

negligence. The action, however, was brought in conversion,
and both sides insist that it was tried as a conversion action. The judgment
therefore

may only be sustained, if at all, upon that theory. * * *

Judgment affirmed, with $25 costs, with leave to defendants
to appeal to the Appellate Division.

■ BURR,
J. (concurring). I concur in the conclusion reached by MR. JUSTICE MULLAN and
vote to affirm. I believe that defendants, having received

the bond and taken it into their possession, became liable
even as gratuitous or involuntary bailees for its proper redelivery to the true
owner.

■
LEHMAN, J. (dissenting). I agree in all material particulars with the statement
of facts contained in the opinion of MR. JUSTICE MULLAN. * * *

#479

It is unnecessary now to consider whether the complaint
sufficiently sets forth any cause of action; for no motion was made by the

defendants to dismiss the complaint on the ground of
insufficiency, and no such point is raised on this appeal. It is to be noted,
however, that the

complaint does not allege any negligence on the part of the
defendants, and I agree with Mr. Justice MULLAN that no such issue was
litigated, and

that the judgment can be sustained only if, as a matter of
law, the defendants’ mistake in returning the bond to the wrong messenger
constituted a

conversion of the bond or at least a breach of an implied
agreement on their part to return the bond only to the plaintiffs.

While the slot in the window constituted an invitation to
deliver at that place securities intended for the defendants, it is evident
that it

constituted an invitation only to deliver securities which
the defendants were under some obligation to receive. Obviously no person could
by

slipping in other securities impose upon the defendants
without their consent any affirmative obligation to care for these securities,
to pay for

them, or even to receive them. The plaintiffs never intended
to deliver to the defendants an Oregon & California Railroad bond. By their
mistake

the plaintiffs divested themselves of possession of the
bond, but they did not transfer to the defendants either title or right to
possession if they

demanded the return of the bond. The defendants had not
consented to accept the bond as a deposit, they claimed no title to it, and
they were not

subject to any trust or obligation as bailees, for a
bailment arises only through an express or implied contract. They were put in
possession of the

bond without any agreement on their part, express or
implied, to accept the deposit of the bond; and, though persons who come into
possession

of the property of others without their consent are
sometimes for convenience called “involuntary” or “quasi bailees,” they incur
no responsibility

to the true owner in respect thereof. It is only where they
commit some “overt act” of interference with the property that an implied
contract of

bailment is created. * * *

In the present case the defendants were put in possession of
the bond by mistake; they discovered the mistake promptly, and thereafter they

committed no “overt act” of interference with the bond
except that they attempted to divest themselves of this possession by
delivering the bond

to a person whom they believed to be the messenger of the
plaintiffs. That act was not only consistent with the continued title and right
of

dominion in the plaintiffs, but was an honest attempt to
restore possession to the true owners. It certainly cannot be contended that
the defendants

were bound at their peril to wait until the plaintiffs came
to their office and physically took away their property; they could take proper
steps to

divest themselves of the possession thrust upon them by
mistake without thereby impliedly agreeing, contrary to their clear intention,
to accept

possession as bailees with the consequent obligations
flowing from such relation. It is quite immaterial whether we call these
defendants bailees

or not if we keep in mind the fact that the possession of
these goods was

#480

thrust upon them by mistake of the plaintiffs and without
their invitation or consent, and that therefore any liability for failure to
return the goods

to the true owner upon demand must be the result of some act
voluntarily done by the defendant thereafter. An attempt to return the bond to
the

true owner or to the person who delivered it cannot be
considered as inconsistent with a recognition of the complete ownership and
right of

dominion by the true owner, and certainly shows no intent to
accept the possession thrust upon the defendants by plaintiffs’ mistake, and I
fail to

see how, in the absence of such elements, any implied
contract of bailment can arise. If in making an attempt to return the goods,
which was

lawful and proper in itself, the defendants used means which
were not reasonable and proper, and as a result thereof the goods were lost or

misdelivered, then the defendants would be liable for
negligence or possibly for conversion, for every man is responsible for his own
acts; but, if

the defendants had a right to divest themselves of
possession and attempt to return the goods, then, in the absence of some
obligation resting

upon contract to deliver the goods only to the true owner or
upon his order, I do not see how the mere fact that through innocent mistake
the

defendants handed the bond to the wrong messenger could
constitute a conversion. The defendants could not properly disregard entirely
the

mistake in the delivery of the bonds. Common courtesy and
prudence, if not the law, certainly placed upon them the duty to take some
steps by

which the plaintiffs would be apprised of their mistake and
enabled to regain their property. The defendants might have placed the bond in
a safe

and telephoned to the plaintiffs to call for the bond, but
they were under the impression that the messenger who delivered the bond was
still

present, and they gave the bond to him as a means of
carrying out their evident duty to apprise the plaintiffs of their error and
revest possession

in them. * * *

Liability in law must in all cases be founded either on
contract or on some wrongful act. The defendants in this case promptly evinced
their

intention not to accept the possession of the bond thrust
upon them by mistake; they merely attempted to divest themselves of this
possession,

and certainly from such attempt no agreement to accept this
possession can be implied. Until that time the defendants were under no
obligation

either to accept the bond as bailees or return it upon
demand to the true owners unless at the time of the demand the bond was still
in their

possession; and it seems to me anomalous and illogical to
say that an absolute obligation to return the bond to the plaintiffs, and not
to deliver it

to any other person, arises merely from the fact that the
defendants did by mistake and through an honest disclaimer of any title or
right of

possession in the bond physically deliver it to another.
They claimed no title and no right to possession in the bond; they attempted to
transfer no

title or right of possession of their own in the bond; they
had physical possession of the bond through plaintiffs’ mistake; and they
transferred

nothing but this physical possession. The plaintiffs could
not compel them to retain physical possession, and their act of transferring
physical

#481

possession even to a stranger under these circumstances
shows no exercise of any dominion over the property, for it constitutes no
denial of the

complete and sole right of dominion in the plaintiffs. In my
opinion plaintiffs have therefore no right of action against the defendants
unless the

means which the defendants used to rid themselves of their
possession were not reasonable and proper. * * *

Even if under these pleadings we could consider the question
of negligence, I find no evidence upon this question to sustain a judgment in

favor of the plaintiffs. There is no doubt that the
defendants acted in good faith and in the honest belief that they were handing
back the bond to

the messenger who delivered it. They had assumed no
obligation of any kind to the plaintiffs; any act they performed was for the
plaintiffs’

benefit, and it was through plaintiffs’ mistake that they
were called upon to act at all in the premises. Doubtless, if they had foreseen
the

possibility of mistake, they would not have delivered the
bond to the wrong messenger; but it was not unreasonable to suppose that the

messenger might be waiting or that, if he had left, no thief
would be in the office who would claim to represent the plaintiffs. They
probably

committed an error of judgment, but for such error they
cannot be held liable. Since they owed no obligation to the plaintiffs and
acted in good

faith under the reasonable belief that they were returning
the bond to the messenger who delivered it, I see no ground for imposing upon
them

liability for the loss of a bond which would never have been
lost but for the plaintiffs’ mistake, due apparently to the plaintiffs’
negligence. * * *

For these reasons, it seems to me that the judgment should
be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .One general issue raised by _Cowen_ is whether a bailment
can ever be created when there is no contract—no meeting of the minds—between
the

bailor and the bailee. Esteemed commentators have long
disagreed about this. Blackstone and Story both maintained that there could be
no bailment

without a contract. See 2 William Blackstone, Commentaries
on the Laws of England * 452 – 54 ; Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Law of
Bailments

§ 2 , at 5 (James Schouler ed., 9 th ed. 1878 ). But other
commentators have argued that bailment relationships can arise in contexts,
like the finding of lost

```

property, where no contract exists between the bailor and
bailee. See 9 Samuel Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts § 1030 , at
875 (Walter H.E.

Jaeger ed., 3 d ed. 1967 ); William King Laidlaw, Principles
of Bailment, 16 Cornell L. Q. 286 , 287 ( 1931 ). To a certain extent this
dispute is

terminological. If different duties of care attach to
someone who is a “true” bailee (based on contract) and an “involuntary” or
“constructive” bailee

(where there is no contract), then we can speak of Type I
and Type II bailments, or of bailments and something else, like “custodial
obligations.” If some

duty of care attaches to a person who takes up custody of
property he knows belongs to another, but with whom he has no contractual
relationship, what

is the source of this duty? Must these duties be grounded in
some conception of the nature of property rights? See Christopher Newman,
Bailment and

the Property/Contract Interface (September 2 , 2015 ),
available at [http://ssrn.com/](http://ssrn.com/) abstract= 2654988.

2 .In _Cowen_ , the court was required to sort out two
issues. First, what sort of duty of care attaches to a firm that acquires
temporary custody of a

bond by mistake? Second, does the rule of strict liability
that applies to a bailee who misdelivers a bailed good to a third party, as
opposed to losing or

damaging a good while it is in its custody, apply to such a
firm? The categories the court has to work with—“bailee”, “involuntary bailee,”
“stranger”—

do not seem to be nuanced enough to allow the court to come
up with a satisfactory resolution.

3 .Does it make sense to treat a securities firm that
receives the wrong bond by mistake from a firm with which it has regular
dealings as being

subject to the same standard of care as someone who finds a
ring on the sidewalk? (Finders are typically regarded as “involuntary
bailees.”) Surely,

given the relationship between the firms and their frequent
interaction, one would expect the firm that receives the bond by mistake to
take reasonable

steps to secure the bond and ensure that it makes it back
safely to the sending firm. It is not clear that one would expect the same
degree of diligence on

the part of a mere finder, who has no clue about the
identity of the true owner.

4 .Why are bailees subject to strict liability for
misdelivery, but only subject to a duty of reasonable care for lost, stolen, or
destroyed goods? The

doctrinal answer is that bailors sued bailees for conversion
in cases of misdelivery, and conversion imposes strict liability on one who
converts or

permits another to convert property belonging to someone
else. Bailors sued bailees for trespass on the case in instances involving
lost, stolen, or

destroyed goods, and this action came to require proof of
negligence. Otherwise, commentators have found the distinction difficult to
justify:

The difference cannot be explained in terms of the degree of
harm to the bailor. The bailor loses the property in either case. Indeed, the

loss is if anything _less_ severe in the case of
misdelivery, because there is some chance that the property can be recovered
from the third party

who has erroneously received it.

The higher standard of care that traditionally applies to
misdelivery begins to make more sense, however, once we realize that

misdelivery is a * * * situation that entails * * * the

```



483



```

introduction of the * * * third party. The rule of strict
liability seeks to correct for the unequal information between the bailor and
the bailee

about the risk of transfer to a third party.

Thomas W. Merrill & Henry E. Smith, The
Property/Contract Interface, 101 Colum. L. Rev. 773 , 816 ( 2001 ). The authors
also note that “[b]ecause

misdelivery confers a benefit on a third party, the bailee
may be tempted to connive with a third party to ‘misdeliver’ the property, and
it will be difficult

for the bailor to prove that this has happened.” Id. at 815.

#### The Winkfield

```



Court of Appeal (Eng.), 1901.



[ 1902 ] P. 42 , [ 1902 – 1903 ] All E.R. 346.



```

On April 5, 1900, a collision occurred in a fog off Table
Bay, on the coast of Cape Colony, South Africa, between the Government
transport

Winkfield, belonging to the Seafield Shipping Company,
Limited, outward bound to the Cape with troops for service in South Africa, and
the

Union mail steam vessel Mexican from Cape Town, homeward
bound to Southampton with mails, passengers, and cargo. The Winkfield was

damaged and the Mexican sank, but not until all the
passengers, crew, and some of the mails and luggage of the Mexican had been got
on board

the other vessel.

The owners, master, and crew of the Mexican and the owners
of the Winkfield commenced cross-actions, which resulted in the owners of the

Winkfield admitting liability for a moiety of the damage
sustained by the Mexican. * * *

■
COLLINS, MASTER OF THE ROLLS. This is an appeal from the order of Sir Francis
Jeune dismissing a motion made on behalf of the Postmaster-

General in the case of the Winkfield.

The question arises out of a collision which occurred on
April 5, 1900, between the steamship Mexican and the steamship Winkfield , and

which resulted in the loss of the former with a portion of
the mails which she was carrying at the time.

The owners of the Winkfield under a decree limiting
liability to 32,514 £ 17s. 10d. paid that amount into court, and the claim in
question

was one by the Postmaster-General on behalf of himself and
the Postmasters-General of Cape Colony and Natal to recover out of that sum the

value of letters, parcels, & c., in his custody as
bailee and lost on board the Mexican.

The case was dealt with by all parties in the Court below as
a claim by a bailee who was under no liability to his bailor for the loss in

question, as to which it was admitted that the authority of
Claridge v. South Staffordshire Tramway Co. , [1892] 1 Q. B. 422, was
conclusive, and

the President accordingly, without argument and in deference
to that authority, dismissed the claim. The Postmaster-General now appeals.

#484

Figure 4-7

The Mexican

_Source_ : Marischal Murray, Ships and South Africa (1933).

The question for decision, therefore, is whether Claridge’s
Case was well decided. * * * For the reasons which I am about to state I am of

opinion that Claridge’s Case was wrongly decided, and that
the law is that in an action against a stranger for loss of goods caused by his

negligence, the bailee in possession can recover the value
of the goods, although he would have had a good answer to an action by the
bailor for

damages for the loss of the thing bailed.

It seems to me that the position, that possession is good
against a wrongdoer and that the latter cannot set up the jus tertii unless he
claims

under it, is well established in our law, and really
concludes this case against the respondents. As I shall shew presently, a long
series of

authorities establishes this in actions of trover and
trespass at the suit of a possessor. And the principle being the same, it
follows that he can

equally recover the whole value of the goods in an action on
the case for their loss through the tortious conduct of the defendant. I think
it

involves this also, that the wrongdoer who is not defending
under the title of the bailor is quite unconcerned with what the rights are
between the

bailor and bailee, and must treat the possessor as the owner
of the goods for all purposes quite irrespective of the rights and obligations
as

between him and the bailor.

I think this position is well established in our law, though
it may be that reasons for its existence have been given in some of the cases
which

are not quite satisfactory. I think also that the obligation
of the bailee to the bailor to account for what he has received in respect of
the

destruction or conversion of the thing bailed has been
admitted so often in decided cases that it cannot now be questioned; and,
further, I think it

can be shewn that the right of the bailee to recover cannot
be rested on the ground suggested in some of the cases, namely, that he was
liable over

to the bailor for the loss of the goods converted or
destroyed.

#485

It cannot be denied that since the case of Armory v.
Delamirie , 1 Stra. 504, not to mention earlier cases from the Year Books
onward, a mere

finder may recover against a wrongdoer the full value of the
thing converted. That decision involves the principle that as between possessor
and

wrongdoer the presumption of law is, in the words of Lord
Campbell in Jeffries v. Great Western Ry. Co. , 5 E. & B. 802 [1 19 Eng.
Rep. 680

(Q.B. 1856)], at p. 806, “that the person who has possession
has the property.” In the same case he says at p. 805: “I am of opinion that
the law is

that a person possessed of goods as his property has a good
title as against every stranger, and that one who takes them from him, having
no title

in himself, is a wrongdoer, and cannot defend himself by
shewing that there was title in some third person, for against a wrongdoer
possession is

title. * * * ” Therefore it is not open to the defendant,
being a wrongdoer, to inquire into the nature or limitation of the possessor’s
right, and

unless it is competent for him to do so the question of his
relation to, or liability towards, the true owner cannot come into the
discussion at all;

and, therefore, as between those two parties full damages
have to be paid without any further inquiry. The extent of the liability of the
finder to

the true owner not being relevant to the discussion between
him and the wrongdoer, the facts which would ascertain it would not have been

admissible in evidence, and therefore the right of the
finder to recover full damages cannot be made to depend upon the extent of his
liability

over to the true owner. To hold otherwise would, it seems to
me, be in effect to permit a wrongdoer to set up a jus tertii under which he
cannot

claim.

But, if this be the fact in the case of a finder, why should
it not be equally the fact in the case of a bailee? Why, as against a
wrongdoer,

should the nature of the plaintiff’s interest in the thing
converted be any more relevant to the inquiry, and therefore admissible in
evidence, than

in the case of a finder? It seems to me that neither in one
case nor the other ought it to be competent for the defendant to go into
evidence on that

matter. * * *

The ground of the decision in Claridge’s Case was that the
plaintiff in that case, being under no liability to his bailor, could recover
no

damages, and though for the reasons I have already given I
think this position is untenable, it is necessary to follow it out a little
further. There is

no doubt that the reason given in Heydon and Smith’s Case ,
13 Co. Rep. 67, 69, 77 Eng. Rep. 1476, 1479–80 (K.B. 1611)—and itself drawn
from

the Year Books—has been repeated in many subsequent cases.
The words are these:

Clearly, the bailee, or he who hath a special property,
shall have a general action of trespass against a stranger, and shall recover
all in

damages because that he is chargeable over.

It is now well established that the bailee is accountable,
as stated in the passage cited and repeated in many subsequent cases. But
whether

the obligation to account was a condition of his right to
sue, or only an

#486

incident arising upon his recovery of damages, is a very
different question, though it was easy to confound one view with the other.

Holmes C.J. in his admirable lectures on the Common Law, in
the chapter devoted to bailments, traces the origin of the bailee’s right to
sue

and recover the whole value of chattels converted, and
arrives at the clear conclusion that the bailee’s obligation to account arose
from the fact

that he was originally the only person who could sue, though
afterwards by an extension, not perhaps quite logical, the right to sue was
conceded

to the bailor also. He says at p. 167: “At first the bailee
was answerable to the owner because he was the only person who could sue; now
it was

said he could sue because he was answerable to the owner.” *

* * This inversion, as he points out, is traceable through the Year Books, and
    has

survived into modern times, though, as he shews, it has not
been acted upon. Pollock and Maitland’s History of English Law, vol. 2, p. 170,
puts

the position thus:—“Perhaps we come nearest to historical
truth if we say that between the two old rules there was no logical priority.
The bailee

had the action because he was liable, and was liable because
he had the action.” It may be that in early times the obligation of the bailee
to the

bailor was absolute, that is to say, he was an insurer. But
long after the decision of Coggs v. Bernard , 2 Ld. Raym. 909, 92 Eng. Rep. 107
(Q.B.

1703), which classified the obligations of bailees, the
bailee has, nevertheless, been allowed to recover full damages against a
wrongdoer, where

the facts would have afforded a complete answer for him
against his bailor. The cases above cited are instances of this. In each of
them the bailee

would have had a good answer to an action by his bailor; for
in none of them was it suggested that the act of the wrongdoer was traceable to

negligence on the part of the bailee. I think, therefore,
that the statement drawn, as I have said, from the Year Books may be explained,
as

Holmes C.J. explains it, but whether that be the true view
of it or not, it is clear that it has not been treated as law in our Courts.

Upon this, before the decision in Claridge’s Case , there
was a strong body of opinion in text-books, English and American, in favour of
the

bailee’s unqualified right to sue the wrongdoer * * * The
bailee’s right to recover has been affirmed in several American cases entirely
without

reference to the extent of the bailee’s liability to the
bailor for the tort, though his obligation to account is admitted * * * [T]he
root principle of

the whole discussion is that, as against a wrongdoer,
possession is title. The chattel that has been converted or damaged is deemed
to be the

chattel of the possessor and of no other, and therefore its
loss or deterioration is his loss, and to him, if he demands it, it must be
recouped. His

obligation to account to the bailor is really not ad rem in
the discussion. It only comes in after he has carried his legal position to its
logical

consequence against a wrongdoer, and serves to soothe a mind
disconcerted by the notion that a person who is not himself the complete owner

should be entitled to receive back the full value of the
chattel converted or destroyed. There is no inconsistency between the two

#487

positions; the one is the complement of the other. As
between bailee and stranger possession gives title—that is, not a limited
interest, but

absolute and complete ownership, and he is entitled to
receive back a complete equivalent for the whole loss or deterioration of the
thing itself.

As between bailor and bailee the real interests of each must
be inquired into, and, as the bailee has to account for the thing bailed, so he
must

account for that which has become its equivalent and now
represents it. What he has received above his own interest he has received to
the use of

his bailor. The wrongdoer, having once paid full damages to
the bailee, has an answer to any action by the bailor.

The liability by the bailee to account is also well
established—see the passage from Lord Coke, and the cases cited in the earlier
part of this

judgment—and therefore it seems to me that there is no such
preponderance of convenience in favour of limiting the right of the bailee as
to

make it desirable, much less obligatory, upon us to modify
the law as it rested upon the authorities antecedent to Claridge’s Case. * * *

Claridge’s Case was treated as open to question by the late
Master of the Rolls in Meux v. Great Eastern Ry. Co. , 2 Q. B. 387 (1895), and,
with

the greatest deference to the eminent judges who decided it,
it seems to me that it cannot be supported. It seems to have been argued before
them

upon very scanty materials. Before us the whole subject has
been elaborately discussed, and all, or nearly all, the authorities brought
before us in

historical sequence.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1. _The Winkfield_ is significant in rejecting the _jus
   tertii_ defense in the context of a bailment. The owners of the Winkfield are
   liable in tort. Tort

damages are supposed to serve a deterrent as well as a
compensatory function. Should the immunity of the Postmaster have any effect on
the level of

care taken by the operators of the Winkfield? If the crew of
the Winkfield had acted recklessly or even willfully, they should presumably be
liable for

punitive damages. To whom?

2 .The court broadly hints that after this case, the
Postmaster will hold the funds subject to claims by customers; there will be
some way around the

Postmaster’s immunity. Would the Postmaster be liable to its
customers in restitution (see Part C)? What if only 80 % of the customers (the
bailors) file

claims? (In a similar vein, the postal customers
theoretically could have sued the Winkfield directly. W. Prosser, Handbook of
the Law of Torts § 15 , at

96 ( 4 th ed. 1971 ). There are, however, significant
practical obstacles where many customers have a small claim.) If fewer than all
customers file claims,

leaving some of the damages in the hands of the Postmaster,
would such a windfall to the Postmaster call into question the result in the
case?

3 .What if the bailee is a private shipping company that is
liable to the bailor for contract damages? According to the leading case of
_Hadley v.

Baxendale_ , 156 Eng. Rep. 145 (Ex. 1854 ), the shipper is
liable only for foreseeable damages, and if the customer would like damages for
an especially

valuable package, the customer must reveal the value to the

#488

shipper. Tortfeasors like the Winkfield, on the other hand,
are normally liable for any foreseeable damage caused by their negligence. But
wasn’t

damage to the Mexican foreseeable, with the value of the
cargo merely going to the size of the damages? So if a particularly valuable
package were on

the Mexican, would the Winkfield be liable for the full
damages even though the shipping company would be liable only for reasonably
foreseeable

damages, in the contract sense? Should the Winkfield be able
to limit its liability under _Hadley_? Assuming that it cannot, should the
shipper be able to

keep the difference, or should it be liable in restitution
to the less-than-forthcoming customer?

### 3 .ABANDONMENT AND DESTRUCTION

Owner sovereignty is also commonly thought to include the
right to abandon property (throw it away or relinquish all claim to title) and
the

right to destroy property (demolish, burn, or otherwise
eliminate all or most of its value). This makes sense if we think of property
as an

individual right important to owner autonomy. If the
sovereign owner concludes that the thing is more of a burden than a blessing,
why shouldn’t

she be allowed to get rid of it? But from a broader social
welfare perspective, it is not always so clear that abandonment and destruction
should

be permitted. Consider the following cases.

#### Pocono Springs Civic Association, Inc. v. MacKenzie

```



Superior Court of Pennsylvania, 1995.



667 A. 2 d 233.



```

■
ROWLEY, PRESIDENT JUDGE. The issue in this appeal is whether real property
owned by appellants Joseph W. MacKenzie and Doris C.

MacKenzie has been abandoned, as they claim. In an order
entered January 5, 1995, the trial court granted summary judgment, in the
amount of

$1,739.82, in favor of appellee Pocono Springs Civic
Association, Inc., which argued successfully to the trial court that appellants
had not

abandoned their property located in appellee’s development,
and, therefore appellants were still obligated to pay association fees.^1 * * *

We briefly outline the facts and procedural background of
the case as follows: Appellants purchased a vacant lot at Pocono Springs

Development, located in Wayne County, on October 14, 1969.
In 1987, appellants decided to sell their still-vacant lot. A subsequent offer
for the

#489

purchase of appellants’ lot was conditioned upon the
property being suitable for an on-lot sewage system. Upon inspection, the lot
was

determined to have inadequate soil for proper percolation,
and appellants’ sale was lost. Believing their investment to be worthless,
appellants

attempted to abandon their lot at Pocono Springs
Development. Appellants claimed that because they successfully abandoned their
lot, they are

relieved from any duty to pay the association fees sought by
appellee. The trial court held, however, that the appellant’s abandonment
defense is

“not a valid defense.” We agree with the trial court, and
affirm. * * *

Appellants’ argument, that they successfully abandoned their
lot at Pocono Springs Development, is based upon several actions that they

believe disassociate them from the land. First, appellants,
after learning that the lot would not meet township sewage requirements,
attempted to

turn the lot over to appellee. Appellee declined to accept
the property. Second, appellants tried to persuade appellee to accept the lot
as a gift, to

be used as a park-like area for the community. Appellee
again declined. Third, in 1986 appellants ceased paying real estate taxes on
their lot, and

in 1988 the Wayne County Tax Claim Bureau offered the
property for sale, due to delinquent tax payments. There were no purchasers.
Fourth, in

1990, the lot was again offered for sale by the Tax Claim
Bureau. The property again was not sold. The Bureau then placed the lot on its

“repository” list. Fifth, appellants signed a notarized
statement, mailed to “all interested parties,” Brief for Appellants at 9, which
expressed their

desire to abandon the lot. Sixth, appellants do not accept
mail regarding the property. These occurrences, together with appellants having
neither

visited the lot nor utilized the development’s services
since 1986, cause appellants to “assert that they do not have ‘perfect’ title
to Lot #20, in

Pocono Springs [Development,] [thus] they can and have
abandoned said property back to the sovereign.” Id. at 1 1. On the basis of the
above,

appellants argue that their conduct manifests an intent to
abandon, and that their intent to abandon should be a question of fact which
precludes

summary judgment.

The law of abandonment in Pennsylvania does not support
appellants’ argument. This Court has held that abandoned property is that:

... to which an owner has voluntarily relinquished all
right, title, claim and possession with the intention of terminating his
ownership,

but without vesting it in any other person and with the
intention of not reclaiming further possession or resuming ownership,

possession or enjoyment.

Commonwealth v. Wetmore, 447 A.2d 1012, 1014 (Pa. Super.
1982) (citations omitted). However, in the instant case, appellants have not

relinquished their rights, title, claim and possession of
their lots. They remain owners of real property in fee simple, with a recorded
deed and

“perfect” title. Absent proof to the contrary, possession is
presumed to be

#490

in the party who has record title. Overly v. Hixson, 82 A.2d
573 (Pa. Super. 1951). As appellants themselves concede, with commendable
candor,

see Brief for Appellants at 15, no authority exists in
Pennsylvania that allows for the abandonment of real property when owned in fee
simple

with perfect title.^3 Additionally, appellants properly
admit that neither refusal to pay taxes nor non use of real property
constitutes abandonment.

Brief for Appellants at 16; see also Petition of Indiana
County, 62 A.2d 3, 5 (Pa. 1948) (“It has frequently been held that abandonment
of title is

not to be presumed from a mere failure to possess the land
or from neglect to pay the taxes thereon; inchoate rights may be abandoned but

abandonment is not predictable of perfect titles[.]”). Yet,
appellants nonetheless maintain that their non use, refusal to pay taxes, and
offers to sell

create an abandonment, because of a displayed intent to
abandon.

But appellants simply do not accept that the record shows
that they have retained “perfect” title to their lot. Neither title nor deed
has been

sold or transferred. * * * Perfect title, under Pennsylvania
law, cannot be abandoned. O’Dwyer v. Ream, 136 A.2d 90 (Pa. 1957). In O’Dwyer ,

our Supreme Court held that once it is determined that good
title exists, then the abandonment theory cannot succeed. See also A.D. Graham
&

Company, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, 33 A.2d
22, 29 (Pa. 1943) (which held that the doctrine of abandonment does not apply
to

perfect titles, only to imperfect titles). Appellants do not
cite, and our own research has not discovered, any more recent cases that would
cause

us to question the authority of the cited decisions. Absent
authority to support their argument, therefore, the appeal cannot be successful
for

appellants. In short, as the trial court held,
“[appellant’s] ‘Abandonment Authorization’ [is] not a valid defense.” Trial
Court Opinion (Conway,

P.J.), 1/5/95, at 6.

Appellants further claim that the trial court erred in
granting summary judgment because whether they abandoned their lots should be a

question of intent, for a jury to determine. * * * In the
instant case, appellants’ intent is irrelevant. What is controlling is our law,
which states

that real property cannot be abandoned. The law, therefore,
leaves nothing for a jury to decide on this claim, which amounts to a legal

impossibility.

* * * [A]ppellee is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

unseen, by a California land trust for about $ 500. The lot
remains undeveloped to this day. Pocono Springs Estates is a gated residential
community

intended as a retreat for residents of New York City, New
Jersey, and Philadelphia. To hold down prices, the lots were made narrow, the
expectation

being that a community sewer system would be installed. But
sales of lots were disappointing, assessments lagged, and the sewer system was
never

installed. Most of the lots remain undeveloped today, and
many like the MacKenzies’ have been purchased by internet speculators who do
not pay their

assessments. The association web site long contained the
following disclaimer in all capitals: “If you are looking to purchase a lot in
Pocono Springs,

whether it is from eBay, a private owner, or the county
itself, we advise that you do some research prior to purchasing. There are some
lots in Pocono

Springs that do not pass percolation tests, and cannot be
built upon. There are other lots that are not of sufficient size to allow for a
building. Not every

lot is buildable. No lot is exempt from dues, regardless of
suitability for building.” Perhaps because of the high rate of tax
foreclosures, the community

is intensely suspicious of outsiders. One of the editors was
denied permission to enter the community to photograph the MacKenzies’ lot.

2 .Abandonment of personal property occurs all the time.
Every time you take out the garbage, throw something in the waste basket, or
haul

something to the dump, you are abandoning personal property.
Mineral rights are often subject to claims of abandonment when the owners have
done

nothing to exploit the rights for a period of time.
Likewise, easements can be abandoned. Nevertheless, the traditional rule, as
the Pennsylvania Supreme

Court reports, is that real property cannot be abandoned.
See Restatement of Property § 504 cmt. a ( 1944 ). The original rationale for
this rule probably

related to the incidents and services that landowners were
supposed to perform in feudal England, which meant that there could be no gap
in “seisin” of

real property. See Chapter V; Lior J. Strahilevitz, The
Right to Abandon, 158 U. Pa. L. Rev. 355 , 399 ( 2010 ).

3 .This may be an area of the law where formal rules and
practice diverge, at least in certain circumstances. During the settlement of
the United

States, settlers would purchase land (often sight unseen) or
file a claim for land under the Homestead Acts; if they discovered once they
took up

possession of the land that they could not make a go of it,
they would simply “pull up stakes” and move on. Usually this happened before a
formal title

(called a land patent) issued to the settler, so it was not
technically abandonment. But functionally speaking it was similar. The recent
mortgage crisis in

the U.S. also suggests that something similar to abandonment
occurs when house prices fall to the point where homeowners owe more in
mortgage debt

than the house is worth. At least where the homeowner has a
“non-recourse” loan, meaning the lender cannot seek to recover the balance due
from the

homeowner’s other assets, many homeowners in these
circumstances simply stopped making payments. When this happens, the

```



492



```

lender typically institutes a foreclosure proceeding (see
Chapter VII), which results in title and possession being transferred from the
homeowner to the

lender—in effect the homeowner abandons real property to the
lender.

4 .The notion that one cannot abandon real property is also
a little odd given other powers (or liabilities) associated with ownership of
land. If the

owner of real property pays no attention to it, and another
person enters onto the property, the owner can lose title to the occupant by
adverse possession

(see Chapter II). Isn’t this a kind of abandonment by
inattention or negligence? And of course gifts of real property are perfectly
permissible. Isn’t a gift

of real property a decision by the owner to abandon any
claim to the property, combined with designation of someone else as the new
owner? Note

however that in the adverse possession and gift situations,
a new owner takes the place of the owner who has lost or abandoned any claim.
The

MacKenzies want to relinquish ownership without any
substitute owner being designated to take their place.

5 .The MacKenzies’ basic problem is that their lot in the
Poconos has become a negative-value asset. The liabilities associated with the
lot—the

annual assessment fee imposed by the homeowners’ association
plus the property taxes—exceed the positive value anyone can obtain from the
lot, given

that local land-use regulations prohibit the installation of
a septic field. So no one wants it—not the MacKenzies, not any potential
purchaser, not the

homeowners’ association, not even the government (which has
the right to take and sell the land because of the unpaid property taxes). But
doesn’t this

describe the condition that leads to abandonment of property
in any context? The reason one throws a piece of paper in the waste basket or
an empty

food container in the garbage is because it has become (for
the owner) a negative-value asset. Provided the MacKenzies’ action violates no

environmental laws, why shouldn’t they be allowed to toss
the lot in the Poconos in the trash can, so to speak?

6 .Perhaps real property is different because of concern
about externalities that might be created by abandonment of real property. The
most

obvious example would be real property that is a hazardous
waste disposal site. Cleaning up the wastes (to protect against future releases
affecting

neighboring property or exposure of third parties) can often
cost more than the property is worth in fair market value terms. Not
surprisingly, therefore,

environmental statutes like the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) impose limits on an owner’s

ability to escape liability for cleanup costs through
abandonment. See 42 U.S.C. § 101 ( 20 )(A) (providing that if a state or local
government acquires

property through abandonment “any person who owned,
operated, or otherwise controlled activities at such facility immediately
beforehand” is deemed

to be the owner).

7 .Come to think of it, aren’t there externality problems
associated with abandonment of personal property too? What do you think about a
strategy

of reducing litter, and encouraging recycling, by declaring
that personal property cannot be abandoned?

```



493



```

8 .Whether property has been abandoned is a question of
intent: The owner must intend to relinquish all claims to the property with no
intent that it

be acquired by any particular person. The item can then be
claimed by the first person who asserts control over it. Strahilevitz, supra at
376. Whether

someone intends to abandon property is usually clear from
context. An old chair placed just outside the front door is probably being
moved in or out; the

same chair placed on the curb is probably being abandoned.
Nevertheless, problems are encountered. A German art museum discovered that
custodial

workers had thrown out a work of art by Berlin sculptor
Michael Beutler made out of the yellow plastic sheeting used to encase cement.
The workers

had assumed it was construction rubbish. After the episode,
the museum announced that it was instituting monthly “Check Your Art Sense!”
classes for

the city’s sanitation crews.

■
RENDLEN, JUDGE. Plaintiffs appeal from denial of their petition seeking
injunction to prevent demolition of a house at #4 Kingsbury Place in the

City of St. Louis. The action is brought by individual
neighboring property owners and certain trustees for the Kingsbury Place
Subdivision. We

reverse.

Louise Woodruff Johnston, owner of the property in question,
died January 14, 1973, and by her will directed the executor “... to cause our

home at 4 Kingsbury Place... to be razed and to sell the
land upon which it is located... and to transfer the proceeds of the sale... to
the

residue of my estate.” Plaintiffs assert that razing the
home will adversely affect their property rights, violate the terms of the
subdivision trust

indenture for Kingsbury Place, produce an actionable private
nuisance and is contrary to public policy.

The area involved is a “private place” established in 1902
by trust indenture which provides that Kingsbury Place and Kingsbury Terrace

will be so maintained, improved, protected and managed as to
be desirable for private residences. The trustees are empowered to protect and

preserve “Kingsbury Place” from encroachment, trespass,
nuisance or injury, and it is “the intention of these presents, forming a
general scheme

of improving and maintaining said property as desirable
residence property of the highest class.” The covenants run with the land and
the

indenture empowers lot owners or the trustees to bring suit
to enforce them.

Except for one vacant lot, the subdivision is occupied by
handsome, spacious two and three-story homes, and all must be used exclusively

as private residences. The indenture generally regulates
location, costs and similar features for any structures in the subdivision, and
limits

construction of subsidiary structures except those that may
beautify the

#494

property, for example, private stables, flower houses,
conservatories, play houses or buildings of similar character.

On trial the temporary restraining order was dissolved and
all issues found against the plaintiffs. * * *

The issues, simply stated, involve: (1) Private nuisance;
(2) enforcement of restrictive covenants and (3) public policy. * * *

Whether #4 Kingsbury Place should be razed is an issue of
public policy involving individual property rights and the community at large.

The plaintiffs have pleaded and proved facts sufficient to
show a personal, legally protectible interest.

Demolition of the dwelling will result in an unwarranted
loss to this estate, the plaintiffs and the public. The uncontradicted
testimony was

that the current value of the house and land is $40,000.00;
yet the estate could expect no more than $5,000.00 for the empty lot, less the
cost of

demolition at $4,350.00, making a grand loss of $39,350.33
if the unexplained and capricious direction to the executor is effected. Only
$650.00

of the $40,000.00 asset would remain.

Kingsbury Place is an area of high architectural
significance, representing excellence in urban space utilization. Razing the
home will

depreciate adjoining property values by an estimated
$10,000.00 and effect corresponding losses for other neighborhood homes. The
cost of

constructing a house of comparable size and architectural
exquisiteness would approach $200,000.00.

The importance of this house to its neighborhood and the
community is reflected in the action of the St. Louis Commission on Landmarks

and Urban Design designating Kingsbury Place as a landmark
of the City of St. Louis. This designation, under consideration prior to the

institution of this suit, points up the aesthetic and
historical qualities of the area and assists in stabilizing Central West End
St. Louis. It was

testified by the Landmarks Commission chairman that the
private place concept, once unique to St. Louis, fosters higher home
maintenance

standards and is among the most effective methods for
stabilizing otherwise deteriorating neighborhoods. The executive director of
Heritage St.

Louis, an organization operating to preserve the
architecture of the city, testified to the importance of preserving Kingsbury
Place intact:

The reasons (sic) for making Kingsbury Place a landmark is
that it is a definite piece of urban design and architecture. It starts out
with

monumental gates on Union. There is a long corridor of
space, furnished with a parkway in the center, with houses on either side of
the

street,... The existence of this piece of architecture
depends on the continuity of the (sic) both sides. Breaks in this continuity
would

be as holes in this wall, and would detract from the urban
design qualities of the streets. And the richness of the street is this belt of

green lot on either side, with rich tapestry of the
individual houses along the sides.

#495

Many of these houses are landmarks in themselves, but they
add up to much more... I would say Kingsbury Place, as a whole, with

its design, with its important houses... is a most
significant piece of urban design by any standard.

To remove #4 Kingsbury from the street was described as
having the effect of a missing front tooth. The space created would permit
direct

access to Kingsbury Place from the adjacent alley,
increasing the likelihood the lot will be subject to uses detrimental to the
health, safety and

beauty of the neighborhood. The mere possibility that a
future owner might build a new home with the inherent architectural
significance of the

present dwelling offers little support to sustain the
condition for destruction.

We are constrained to take judicial notice of the pressing
need of the community for dwelling units as demonstrated by recent U.S. Census

Bureau figures showing a decrease of more than 14% in St.
Louis City housing units during the decade of the 60’s. This decrease occurs in
the

face of housing growth in the remainder of the metropolitan
area. It becomes apparent that no individual, group of individuals nor the
community

generally benefits from the senseless destruction of the
house; instead, all are harmed and only the caprice of the dead testatrix is
served.

Destruction of the house harms the neighbors, detrimentally
affects the community, causes monetary loss in excess of $39,000.00 to the
estate

and is without benefit to the dead woman. No reason, good or
bad, is suggested by the will or record for the eccentric condition. This is
not a

living person who seeks to exercise a right to reshape or
dispose of her property; instead, it is an attempt by will to confer the power
to destroy

upon an executor who is given no other interest in the
property. To allow an executor to exercise such power stemming from apparent
whim and

caprice of the testatrix contravenes public policy.

The Missouri Supreme Court held in State ex rel. McClintock
v. Guinotte, 204 S.W. 806, 808 (Mo. 1918), that the taking of property by

inheritance or will is not an absolute or natural right but
one created by the laws of the sovereign power. The court points out the state
“may

foreclose the right absolutely, or it may grant the right
upon conditions precedent, which conditions, if not otherwise violative of our

Constitution, will have to be complied with before the right
of descent and distribution (whether under the law or by will) can exist.”
Further, this

power of the state is one of inherent sovereignty which
allows the state to “say what becomes of the property of a person, when death
forecloses

his right to control it.” McClintock v. Guinotte, supra, at
808, 809. While living, a person may manage, use or dispose of his money or
property

with fewer restraints than a decedent by will. One is
generally restrained from wasteful expenditure or destructive inclinations by
the natural

desire to enjoy his property or to accumulate it during his
lifetime. Such considerations however have not tempered the

#496

extravagance or eccentricity of the testamentary disposition
here on which there is no check except the courts.

In the early English case of Egerton v. Brownlow, 10
Eng.Rep. 359, 417 (H.L.C. 1853), it is stated: “The owner of an estate may
himself do

many things which he could not (by a condition) compel his
successor to do. One example is sufficient. He may leave his land uncultivated,
but

he cannot by a condition compel his successor to do so. The
law does not interfere with the owner and compel him to cultivate his land,
(though

it may be for the public good that land should be
cultivated) so far the law respects ownership; but when, by a condition, he
attempts to compel

his successor to do what is against the public good, the law
steps in and pronounces the condition void and allows the devisee to enjoy the
estate

free from the condition.” A more recent application of this
principle is found in M’Caig’s Trustees v. Kirk-Session of the United Free
Church of

Lismore, et al., 1915 Sess.Cas. 426 (Scot.). There, by
codicil to her will, testatrix ordered certain statues erected to honor her
family in a tower

built in the form of an amphitheater on a hill. Balustrades
were to be erected so that even the public would have no access inside the
tower.

Special provision was made for keeping out the public and
the ground enclosed was expressly declared to be a private enclosure. There
were no

living descendants of any member of the family who might, if
so permitted, take pleasure in contemplating the proposed statues. The court
states

at 434 : “If a bequest such as in Miss M’Caig’s codicil were
held good, money would require to be expended in perpetuity merely gratifying
an

absurd whim which has neither reason nor public sentiment in
its favor.” In striking down the provisions of the codicil, the court further
notes

that there is indeed a “difference between what a man,
uncognosed, may do at his own hand, and what the law will support under the
provisions

of his will... therefore, without being illegal in the sense
of being contrary to any express rule of the common law or contrary to any
statute, the

principle of public policy will prevent such post-mortem
expenditure. Whether the act is sufficiently contrary to public policy to
warrant the

court’s interference must depend on the degree to which it
is against public policy.” The court further observed that the erection of the
eleven

statues “would be of no benefit to anyone except those
connected with the carrying out of the work, for whose interest she expresses
no

concern.” M’Caig’s Trustees v. Kirk-Session of the United
Free Church of Lismore, et al., supra at 438. In the case sub judice, testatrix
similarly

expressed no such concern; nothing in the will or record
indicates an intent to benefit any razing company called upon to destroy her
beautiful

home.

In the case of In re Scott’s Will, Board of Commissioners of
Rice County v. Scott et al., 93 N.W. 109 (Minn. 1903), the Supreme Court of

Minnesota stated, when considering the provision of a will
directing the executor to destroy money belonging to the estate: “We assume,
for

purpose of this decision, that the direction in the codicil
to the executor

#497

to destroy all of the residue of the money or cash or
evidences of credit belonging to the estate was void.” In re Scott’s Will,
supra at 109. See

also Restatement, Second, Trusts § 124, at 267: “Although a
person may deal capriciously with his own property, his self interest
ordinarily will

restrain him from doing so. Where an attempt is made to
confer such a power upon a person who is given no other interest in the
property, there

is no such restraint and it is against public policy to
allow him to exercise the power if the purpose is merely capricious.” The text
is followed by

this illustration: “A bequeaths $1,000.00 to B in trust to
throw the money into the sea. B holds the money upon a resulting trust for the
estate of

A and is liable to the estate of A if he throws the money
into the sea.” Restatement, supra at 267. * * *

It is important to note that the purposes of testatrix’s
trust will not be defeated by injunction; instead, the proceeds from the sale
of the

property will pass into the residual estate and thence to
the trust estate as intended, and only the capricious destructive condition
will be enjoined.

---

The term “public policy” cannot be comprehensively defined
in specific terms but the phrase “against public policy” has been characterized

as that which conflicts with the morals of the time and
contravenes any established interest of society. Acts are said to be against
public policy

“when the law refuses to enforce or recognize them, on the
ground that they have a mischievous tendency, so as to be injurious to the
interests of

the state, apart from illegality or immorality.” Dille v.
St. Luke’s Hospital, 196 S.W.2d 615, 620 (Mo. 1946); Brawner v. Brawner, 327
S.W.2d

808, 812 (Mo. banc 1959).

Public policy may be found in the Constitution, statutes and
judicial decisions of this state or the nation. In re Rahn’s Estate, 291 S.W.
120

(Mo. 1927). But in a case of first impression where there
are no guiding statutes, judicial decisions or constitutional provisions, “a
judicial

determination of the question becomes an expression of
public policy provided it is so plainly right as to be supported by the general
will.” In re

Mohler’s Estate, 22 A.2d 680, 683 (Pa. 1941). In the absence
of guidance from authorities in its own jurisdiction, courts may look to the
judicial

decisions of sister states for assistance in discovering
expressions of public policy.

Although public policy may evade precise, objective
definition, it is evident from the authorities cited that this senseless
destruction serving

no apparent good purpose is to be held in disfavor. A
well-ordered society cannot tolerate the waste and destruction of resources
when such acts

directly affect important interests of other members of that
society. It is clear that property owners in the neighborhood of #4 Kingsbury,
the St.

Louis Community as a whole and the beneficiaries of
testatrix’s estate will be severely injured should the provisions of the will
be followed. No

benefits are present to balance against this injury and we
hold that to

#498

allow the condition in the will would be in violation of the
public policy of this state.

Having thus decided, we do not reach the plaintiffs’
contentions regarding enforcement of the restrictions in the Kingsbury Place
trust

indenture and actionable private nuisance, though these
contentions may have merit.

The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the
Circuit Court to enter judgment as prayed.

■
CLEMENS, JUDGE (dissenting). * * * The simple issue in this case is whether the
trial court erred by refusing to enjoin a trustee from carrying out

an explicit testamentary directive. In an emotional opinion,
the majority assumes a psychic knowledge of the testatrix’ reasons for
directing her

home be razed; her testamentary disposition is characterized
as “capricious,” “unwarranted,” “senseless,” and “eccentric.” But the record is

utterly silent as to her motives.

The majority’s reversal of the trial court here spawns
bizarre and legally untenable results. By its decision, the court officiously
confers a

“benefit” upon testamentary beneficiaries who have never
litigated or protested against the razing. The majority opinion further
proclaims that

public policy demands we enjoin the razing of this private
residence in order to prevent land misuse in the City of St. Louis. But the
City, like the

beneficiaries, is not a party to this lawsuit. The fact is
the majority’s holding is based upon wispy, self-proclaimed public policy
grounds that

were only vaguely pleaded, were not in evidence, and were
only sketchily briefed by the plaintiffs. * * *

Kingsbury Place is a “private place” established in 1902 by
trust indenture. Except for one well-tended vacant lot (whose existence the

majority ignores in saying the street minus #4 Kingsbury
Place would be like “a missing front tooth”) the trust indenture generally
regulates size,

constructions and cost of structures to be built on
Kingsbury Place. It empowers the trustees to maintain vacant lots and to
protect the street from

“encroachment, trespass, nuisance and injury.” The
indenture’s acknowledgment that vacant lots did and would exist shows that such
lots were

not to be considered an “injury.” The fact the indenture
empowers the trustees to maintain vacant lots is neither an express nor an
implied ban

against razing residences. The indenture simply recognizes
that Kingsbury Place may have vacant lots from time to time—as it now has—and

that the trustees may maintain them—as they now do. The
indenture itself affords plaintiffs no basis for injunctive relief. * * *

The majority opinion bases its reversal on public policy.
But plaintiffs themselves did not substantially rely upon this nebulous
concept.

Plaintiffs’ brief contends merely that an “agency of the
City of St. Louis has recently [?] designated Kingsbury Place as a landmark,”
citing

§ 24.070, Revised Code of the City of St. Louis. Plaintiffs
argue

#499

removal of the Johnston home would be “intentional...
destruction of a landmark of historical interest.” Neither the ordinance cited
in the brief

nor any action taken under it were in evidence. Indeed, the
Chairman of the Landmarks and Urban Design Commission testified the Commission

did not declare the street a landmark until after Mrs.
Johnston died. A month after Mrs. Johnston’s death, several residents of the
street

apparently sensed the impending razing of the Johnston home
and applied to have the street declared a landmark. The Commissioner testified
it

was the Commission’s “civic duty to help those people.” * *
*

The leading Missouri case on public policy as that doctrine
applies to a testator’s right to dispose of property is In re Rahn’s Estate,
291

S.W. 120 (Mo. banc 1927). There, an executor refused to pay
a bequest on the ground the beneficiary was an enemy alien, and the bequest was

therefore against public policy. The court denied that
contention: “We may say, at the outset, that the policy of the law favors
freedom in the

testamentary disposition of property and that it is the duty
of the courts to give effect to the intention of the testator, as expressed in
his will,

provided such intention does not contravene an established
rule of law.” And the court wisely added, “it is not the function of the
judiciary to

create or announce a public policy of its own, but solely to
determine and declare what is the public policy of the state or nation as such
policy is

found to be expressed in the Constitution, statutes, and
judicial decisions of the state or nation,... not by the varying opinions of
laymen,

lawyers, or judges as to the demands or the interests of the
public.” And, in cautioning against judges declaring public policy the court
stated:

“Judicial tribunals hold themselves bound to the observance
of rules of extreme caution when invoked to declare a transaction void on
grounds of

public policy, and prejudice to the public interest must
clearly appear before the court would be warranted in pronouncing a transaction
void on

this account.” In resting its decision on public-policy
grounds, the majority opinion has transgressed the limitations declared by our
Supreme

Court in Rahn’s Estate. * * * It requires judicial
imagination to hold, as the majority does, that the mere presence of a second
vacant lot on

Kingsbury Place violates public policy.

As much as our aesthetic sympathies might lie with neighbors
near a house to be razed, those sympathies should not so interfere with our

considered legal judgment as to create a questionable legal
precedent. Mrs. Johnston had the right during her lifetime to have her house
razed,

and I find nothing which precludes her right to order her
executor to raze the house upon her death. It is clear that “the law favors the
free and

untrammeled use of real property.” Gibbs v. Cass, 431 S.W.2d
662 (Mo. Ct. App. 1968). This applies to testamentary dispositions. Mississippi

Valley Trust Co. v. Ruhland, 222 S.W.2d 750 (Mo. 1949). An
owner has exclusive control over the use of his property subject only to the

limitation that such use may not substantially impair
another’s right to peaceably enjoy his property. City of Fredericktown v.
Osborn, 429

S.W.2d 17 (Mo.

#500

Ct. App. 19 68), Reutner v. Vouga, 367 S.W.2d 34 (Mo. Ct.
App. 1963). Plaintiffs have not shown that such impairment will arise from the
mere

presence of another vacant lot on Kingsbury Place.

I find no plain error in the trial court’s denial of
injunctive relief, and on the merits I would affirm the trial court’s judgment.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Much speculation has swirled around Louise Woodruff
Johnston’s motivation in directing “our home” to be razed. Apparently her
parents built

the house and she lived there all her adult life. Julius K.
Hunter, Kingsbury Place: The First Two Hundred Years ( 1982 ). Her eight-page
original will

dated April 1 , 1970 and professionally prepared, contains
the razing provision in the fourth of seven numbered sections. Three codicils
that were added

in 1971 and 1972 , the last dated a little more than three
months before her death, did not amend the provision about razing the house.
Thus, Ms.

Johnston had multiple opportunities to re-consider her
direction to destroy the house, but did not. Does this tend to undermine the
suggestion that her

decision was ill-considered, capricious, or “eccentric”? In
one noted episode from New Haven, Isaphene Hillhouse, who had lived in the
family mansion

her entire life, gave contingent orders for its destruction
in her will. In a letter to a relative, she declared that “there is no more
melancholy spectacle than

to see a fine old house fall to decay, or pass into the
hands of strangers who have no interest in it.” Letter from Isaphene Hillhouse
to James Hillhouse,

March 11 , 1897 (Hillhouse Family Papers, Box 50 , Folder
338 , Sterling Memorial Library, Yale University).

2 .The issue in _Eyerman_ is complicated by the (belated)
designation of the Johnston home as a historical and aesthetic landmark. Today,
historical

and architectural preservation laws are much more common
than

```



501



```

they were when the principal case was decided. In an
important decision reproduced in Chapter X, _Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New
York City_ , 438 U.S.

104 ( 1978 ), the Supreme Court upheld such a historical
preservation law against a challenge that it caused a taking of the owner’s
property. After _Penn

Central_ , is it clear that St. Louis could prohibit the
destruction of an architecturally significant home, before or after the owner’s
death, so long as the

prohibition did not impose unduly harsh financial losses on
the owner (or her estate)?

3 .Suppose the owner of the Barry Bonds baseball at issue in
_Popov_ (discussed in Chapter II) decides for some idiosyncratic reason to
destroy the

baseball in a public ceremony. This imposes no obvious loss
on the community. The actual baseball is a fungible asset indistinguishable
from tens of

thousands of other baseballs, and is easily reproduced. But
because this is understood to be the Barry Bonds record-breaking baseball, the
stunt results in

the destruction of an asset having at one time a market
value among collectors of $ 450 , 000. On the authority of _Eyerman_ , would a
court be justified,

perhaps at the instance of a suit brought by other baseball
collectors, in enjoining such destruction as contrary to public policy? For
another notorious

invocation of the right to destroy, see Stephen E. Sachs,
Saving Toby: Extortion, Blackmail, and the Right to Destroy, 24 Yale L. Pol’y
251 ( 2006 ).

4 .Interestingly, the legal philosopher John Austin uses the
type of situation in _Eyerman_ to illustrate his conception of ownership: “If I
am the

absolute owner of my house, I may destroy it if I will. But
I must not destroy it in such a manner as would amount to an injury to any of
my neighbors.”

3 John Austin, Lectures on Jurisprudence 6 ( 1861 – 1863 ).
Did that happen here? What if Mrs. Johnston’s reason for directing that the
house be razed was

that she wanted to prevent members of a class protected
under antidiscrimination law from ever living there?

5. _Eyerman_ is one of the more aggressive invocations of
   public policy to stop destruction of property ordered in a will. Courts vary in
   their

approaches to this issue. Lior Strahilevitz, The Right to
Destroy, 114 Yale L.J. 781 , 789 – 91 ( 2005 ); Abigail Sykas, Waste Not, Want
Not: Can the Public

Policy Doctrine Prohibit the Destruction of Property by
Testamentary Direction?, Vt. L. Rev. 25 , 30 ( 2001 ). Another area in which
the issue arises

involves the estates of famous authors and artists who leave
instructions that their work or notes be destroyed. If such instructions had
been followed,

the _Aeneid_ and most of the oeuvre of Franz Kafka would
have been completely lost. Should the author’s wishes be respected, or does an
executor have a

duty to preserve the work? A duty to whom?

6 .In general, how much can we rely on the owner’s
incentives as a stand-in for social benefits and costs? On the one hand, an
owner who reduces

value to future owners thereby reduces the price she might
now sell it for, as long as the conditions for capitalization of future values
into present market

values holds (or, alternatively, the owner can hold the
asset long enough for the market price to reflect these values). See, e.g.,
Harold Demsetz, Toward

a Theory of Property Rights, 57 Am. Econ. Rev. 347 , 355

```

```

( 1967 ) (Papers & Proc.); Strahilevitz, supra. On the
other hand, much commentary focuses on the defects in owners’ decisionmaking
processes and the

need for collective intervention to prevent waste. See,
e.g., Joseph L. Sax, Playing Darts with a Rembrandt: Public and Private Rights
in Cultural

Treasures ( 1999 ); Edward J. McCaffery, Must We Have the
Right to Waste?, in New Essays in the Legal and Political Theory of Property 76
(Stephen

R. Munzer ed., 2001 ); see also Michael Heller, The
Boundaries of Private Property, 108 Yale L.J. 1163 , 1165 – 66 ( 1999 ). We
return to this issue in the

materials on dead hand control in Chapters V and VI.
Incidentally, according to the website zillow.com, the house at # 4 Kingsbury
Place is still intact

and is estimated to be worth $ 980 , 300 as of February 9 ,
2022 (In previous editions of this casebook, the value was variously placed at
over $ 1. 1 million

( 2016 ), $ 711 , 000 ( 2011 ), and over $ 1. 2 million (
2007 ).) Kingsbury Place now maintains a website. http:// kings buryplace

7 .From a social welfare perspective, is the right to
destroy more problematic than the right to abandon? After all, abandonment
leaves open the

possibility that some other person will take up the property
and put it to some productive use. Destruction eliminates any value for all
time. But if

individual owners are not allowed to make the decision
whether to destroy property, who should make this decision? Does the value of
the right to

destroy depend on whether property is personal as opposed to
fungible (see excerpts from Margaret Jane Radin, Chapter III)? Should people be
allowed

to leave valuable objects like wedding rings in caskets of
loved ones when they are buried? Should famous people—political leaders,
celebrities, actors

and actresses—be allowed to destroy their personal papers
and diaries before they die? (A notorious case of second thoughts is that of
Dante Gabriel

Rossetti, who buried poems with his wife, Lizzie Siddal, and
later had his friends exhume the decaying and worm-eaten manuscript. Jan Marsh,
Dante

Gabriel Rossetti: Painter and Poet 244 , 368 – 69 , 374 – 79
( 1999 ).)

### E. OTHER OWNER POWERS

We have not exhausted the list of owner powers in this
chapter. Other important powers include the right of succession—to determine
who

will take property upon one’s death; the right to
transfer—either by gift, sale, or lease; and the right to employ property as
security for a loan—

either through a mortgage or a security interest. These
other powers are sufficiently important (and complicated) that they will be
taken up in

later chapters. The right of succession is a major subject
of Chapter V; the right of transfer by gift or sale is taken up in Chapter
VIII; the right to

transfer by lease is considered in Chapter VI; and the power
to employ property as security for a loan is the subject of Chapter VII.

## CHAPTER V

# THE FORMS OF OWNERSHIP

“Out of ould fields must spring and grow the new Corne.”

—Sir Edward Coke, Commentaries, Vol. 1, Preface (1600)

### A. INTRODUCTION

Property law would hardly exist in a world of Robinson
Crusoes, each owning an island and all it contains. Even in our world, if each

identified thing had only a single owner, property law would
be quite a bit simpler. But resources are often put to best use when they can
be

shared in some fashion. If A and B can both have access to a
resource, they can both bring their special skills to using it and can spread
the risk

involved in owning it. A more complex property law, with
divided ownership, unlocks much more value from things.

Access to resources can be divided along a number of
dimensions. We have already seen situations in which an owner’s right to
exclude

gives way to other interests, and this reflects a kind of
sharing of assets. We have also seen how ownership can be separated from
possession, as

in the case of bailments. In this Chapter we focus on
divisions that are built into the title of property itself. The law has
developed an elaborate

menu of forms of ownership, which permit divisions both
across time and among multiple persons at any one point in time. We will not
consider

all forms of ownership in this Chapter. Those covered here
are forms of ownership that evolved over time for freehold interests in land
(and some

extensions to personal property). The forms are less
important today than they were when land was the principal form of wealth and
prestige in

society. But it is still true that one cannot understand the
system of property rights we have today without a basic grasp of these forms
and the

doctrines that govern their interpretation and
implementation. Other forms of property that permit more elaborate governance
of complexes of

assets are covered in Chapter VI, including leaseholds
(landlord-tenant), condominiums and cooperatives, and trusts. Security
interests, another

important type of division, are covered in Chapter VII.
Limited use rights, including easements and servitudes, are treated in Chapter
IX.

Any time an asset is shared among multiple owners, a
collective action problem is created, which can be seen as a kind of miniature

“tragedy of the commons” (Chapter II). Consider the
situation in which two people share ownership of a common asset, say a house.
If they are

members of the same household, they could divide the burdens
and benefits associated with ownership of the house in a variety of ways. One

could own the house and charge the other rent, either
monetary or in kind. Or both could own the house and share the responsibilities
for

#504

taxes, repairs, etc. The house itself might be part of a
larger complex of property rights such as a common-interest community. (See the
next

Chapter.) Problems would arise if one of the owners caused
damage to the house or piled too much junk in it, leaving too little space for
the

other. Another problem, to which we turn momentarily, is
presented by successive owners or users. Ownership can be split across time,
but

current owners do not always have their successors’
interests at heart, and vice versa. Another consideration: If people could
split ownership of

any asset in any way they please, might things start to get
too complicated? In part to limit the collective action problems associated
with having

too many claimants, and in part to keep the information
costs associated with complexity from spiraling out of control, the law limits
the number

and variety of ways in which co-ownership can be organized.

We focus in this Chapter on freehold interests in land,
which (for purely historical reasons) exclude leases. The forms of ownership
for

freehold interests recognized today are the product of
historical evolution over many centuries. The aspirations that motivated legal
actors to

develop certain forms, and to impose certain limitations on
their use, have in many instances long since disappeared. Yet the sedimentary
residue

of their efforts remains. For example, the understanding
that someone must “stand seized” of real property at all times is still
reflected in

contemporary decisions. Still, the original motivation for
this rule was to assure that someone was always available to fulfill feudal
services and

incidents—and these were abolished in 1660!

The good news is that the system of forms devised by
common-law lawyers from the seventeenth century onward has a remarkable
internal

logic to it—more so than most of the common law, and enough
so that it is possible to present the system as a body of rules. The reason for
the

use of highly predictable rules in this context has much to
do with the historical aspiration of landowners to direct who would get their
land after

they died. Obviously, one cannot influence discretionary
decisions made by courts or other actors when one is dead. The solution was to

constrain the discretion of future actors though a system of
rules that any trained lawyer could use to prescribe who would get the property
in the

future, and that any trained lawyer could interpret in order
to advise those having an interest in the matter about who should take the
property,

thereby assuring that the intentions of the deceased were
(mostly) carried out. Thus, although it will be useful to advert to the
historical rationale

for various rules from time to time, the rules themselves
largely stand on their own. The content and the labeling of the rules, at least
in this

instance, are less important than that they can be
manipulated to achieve particular outcomes. But of course in order to
participate in this process

lawyers must first learn the rules.

#505

### B. DIVISIONS BY TIME

When dividing property rights to land over time, the pieces
created must conform to a menu of possibilities called estates in land. An
estate

is a type of property right and measures a person’s interest
in the land in terms of duration. An interest may be either a present
possessory estate

or one that does not take possession until the happening of
some future event—a future interest.

Developments in England and America since the late Middle
Ages have had a major impact on the particular forms and vocabulary used in

dividing up property rights, and on the system of estates in
land in particular. Perhaps more importantly, some of the abiding controversies
over

this long span of history are at the heart of questions
about what function, if any, some of the doctrines surrounding estates and
future interests

perform.

The estates themselves, or at least the vocabulary in which
they are presented, have their roots in the Middle Ages. Under the feudal
system,

particularly as it emerged in the aftermath of the Norman
Conquest of 1066, personal relations were very important. The King would grant
tenure

—something less than full ownership—over lands to lords who
in turn would owe services, chief among them military services, to the King.

These lords would then be able to turn around and
subinfeudate to their underlings. At the bottom of this feudal property-holding
hierarchy were

freeholding peasants. Again, the landholding relation
between lord and peasants centered around a flow of services in both
directions—

protection and adjudication in return for labor and other
services. The obligations of the tenant were originally centered around
military service

and farm labor. The “feudal incidents” of the military
tenures, for example, ranged from the duty to do the lord and the land no harm
(“homage”)

to the duty to provide funds in exigent circumstances and on
the marriage of the lord’s daughter (“aids”) to the duty to pay to allow the
heir of the

deceased tenant to assume the tenancy (“relief”). Some
peasants would hold land in more informal arrangements called copyhold, which
over

time became more formalized.

In the feudal relationship, the identity of the one holding
beneath made a lot of difference. The emphasis was on ensuring service rather
than

making land alienable. Alienability threatened the securing
of the feudal services. As time went on and the military aspect of feudalism
became

less important, money transfers replaced some of these
services, and land became correspondingly more alienable. The component of
services

became less important and perhaps more of a notice-giving
device, in some cases fancifully so. See A.W.B. Simpson, A History of the Land
Law

6 (2d ed. 1986) (noting grant from one William Earl Warren
to be held subject to the service of providing one mad bull annually for his
lordship’s

amusement and a grant of lands requiring the tenant each
Christmas Day “to make a leap, a whistle and a fart coram domino

#506

rege.”). Again, it is important to remember that in the more
personal world of feudal obligation, the terms of the deal between grantor and

grantee were far less standardized than the package of
rights afforded to owners today. See Marc Bloch, Feudal Society 1 15–16, 143–54
(L. A.

Manyon trans., 1961).

The conflict over alienation raged with much maneuvering
until 1290 when the Statute Quia Emptores (named for its first two words,

meaning “because purchasers”) made what later became the fee
simple fully alienable, without a fine, by permitting substitution of the
grantee

for the grantor as the lord’s new tenant. The medieval land
market thus created started out on a small scale, mostly involving odd acres
and plots

between peasants of the same community. With the upheaval in
the wake of the Black Death of the mid-fourteenth century, peasants became

more mobile and began moving in and out of villages; land
sales became significantly more active. Sir Frederick Pollock & Frederic
William

Maitland, The History of English Law Before the Time of
Edward I (2d ed. 1898); Sir William Holdsworth, An Historical Introduction to
the

Land Law (1927); D. McCloskey, The Open Fields of England:
Rent, Risk and the Rate of Interest, 1300–1815, in Markets in History: Economic

Studies of the Past 5, 31–32 (D.W. Galenson ed., 1989).

The problem of occasional payments called feudal
incidents—particularly those due on the death of the owner before transfer to
an heir—

remained, and landowners came to employ a proto-trust
device, called a use and recognized in Chancery, to avoid the feudal incidents.
By having

legal title technically reside in a replaceable trustee and
equitable title in the effective owner (and later his family successors), one
could avoid

payments and obligations that were due only on the death of
the owner of a corresponding legal estate. In 1535, Henry VIII, in order to
deal with

various financial and other difficulties, made a deal with
the common-law lawyers in Parliament that resulted in the Statute of Uses,
effective the

next year. The Statute converted many equitable interests
into legal interests, thereby restoring feudal incidents and increasing the
volume of

business for the common-law courts and the lawyers who
practiced before them. The use soon returned, in the form of the trust, to
which we turn

in Chapter VI. A century later, the parliamentary party
undid the resurrection of the feudal tenures, which was confirmed by Parliament
at the

Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. This legislation
prohibited the monarch from creating new feudal tenures, reinforcing the move
towards a

more strictly standardized property system, with
legislatures as the main sources of change.

The early state legislatures in the United States carried
these developments further, abolishing the remnants of feudal incidents.
Notions we

have today—such as that a payment of rent is inconsistent
with a fee simple—emerged from conflicts between farmers and landowners,

especially in states like New York with a history of
founding by major proprietors. See Eric Kades, The End of the Hudson Valley’s

#507

Peculiar Institution: The Anti-Rent Movement’s Politics,
Social Relations, and Economics, 27 Law & Soc. Inquiry 941 (2002). As you
will see,

the simplification of the system of property forms has been
carried only so far, and not as far as in England since 1925. American
commentators

have long called for further simplification. See, e.g., T.P.
Gallanis, The Future of Future Interests, 60 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 513
(2003); Lawrence

W. Waggoner, Reformulating the Structure of Estates: A
Proposal for Legislative Action, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 729, 732 (1972). And a recent

Restatement of Property seeks to implement these ideas. See
Restatement (Third) Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers §§ 24–26 (Am.

L. Inst. 201 1); see also Restatement (Fourth) of Property,
Vol. 4, Div. 1, Chs. 2–3 (Am. L. Inst. Council Draft No. 3, Sept. 29, 2020).
One

question to ask yourself as you move through these materials
is how such simplification could or should occur. Can a court collapse
distinctions

between estates, or does a step like that require
legislation?

Estates in Land

The so-called freehold interests include the undivided fee
simple and two types of lesser property rights that leave room for future
interests

—the life estate and the defeasible fees. Freehold interests
originally were those that, as noted above, involved feudal military service

obligations, whereas the lease—a nonfreehold estate—did not.
This distinction was reflected in the types of actions that could be brought to

protect the interest, and in the formalities required to
transfer it. In the case of freehold interests, livery of seisin was required
to give publicity to

the transfer, which was originally effected by a ceremony on
the land and could include the handing over of a clod of earth, a twig, or a
key to the

grantee in front of a crowd of people. (In a less than
humane but psychologically insightful procedure, a young child would sometimes
be beaten

on the spot in order to make the memory of the occasion an
indelible and long-lasting one.) Livery of seisin has its echoes in another
notice-

giving device we will study later: Freehold interests tend
to be recorded in land registries, but short-term leases are not.

Note that the holders of a freehold interest, as well as
leaseholders, are still sometimes called “tenants.”

#508

Figure 5-1

Present Possessory Estates

To understand the system as a whole, it is important to keep
in mind which future interests can follow which present possessory interests.

As we consider present possessory interests, future
interests retained by the grantor, and future interests created in a third
party, the diagram in

Figure 5-2 may be helpful.

Present Possessory Interests

1.Fee Simple Absolute. The fee simple absolute is the
largest package of ownership rights, from which others are carved. It is
indefinite in

time, or, put differently, it has no natural end. No owner
will live forever, but the owner can designate a successor owner, by gift,
sale, or will. If

the owner dies intestate—without a will—a state intestacy
statute will designate certain others, typically spouse, children, or various
blood

relatives, as the person’s heirs, who will then take the
property in fee simple.

Example 1 : O grants Blackacre “to Marge and her heirs” or
“to Marge in fee simple,” or “to Marge.”

The fee simple is the largest package of rights, and in a
transfer, a grantor is presumed to give all that she has, unless she indicates

otherwise. Today this is reflected in the fact that if Owner
grants Blackacre “to A,” this creates a fee simple.

There was a time when to create a fee simple in a deed (but
not in a will, where the search for testator’s intent has always led to more

leniency), one had to use the magic words “to A and his/her
heirs.” Saying simply “to A” or even “to A in fee simple” would result in a
life

estate and a reversion (see below). Lawyers tend to be
cautious people, and in deeds conveying fees simple they still often use “to A
and his/her

heirs” or “to A in fee simple” even though strictly speaking
these locutions are no longer required.

#509

Figure 5-2

Diagram of Estates

Contrary to popular usage, a person does not have legal
heirs until her death (while alive, someone has at most heirs apparent ). Marge

Simpson has no heirs until she dies; her husband Homer, and
her children, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie, are only heirs apparent. If a person dies

intestate (without a will) and without heirs, then the
property will escheat to the state in which the property is located.

Understanding the traditional formulation “and his heirs” is
important not just because the phrase is still in common use. It also can be

misleading. The phrase does not mean that the heirs receive
any interest. Recall that a person does not even have heirs until death. Thus,
if

Owner grants “to Marge and her heirs,” Homer and her
children receive nothing. All they have is a “mere expectancy,” which is not an
interest at

all. (Depending on the state’s marital laws, Homer might be
entitled to something on divorce or at Marge’s death, questions to which we
return

below.) Rather, “and her heirs” are words of limitation
describing the interest, as opposed to “to Marge,” which are words of purchase.
(“Words

of limitation” is something of a misnomer in the case of the
fee simple, which is not limited in the sense of the other estates.) Only words
of

#510

purchase designate someone who is to receive an interest,
and a purchaser in this context can be the recipient by sale, gift, or devise
(a grant of

real estate by will). Here that’s Marge (only). Thus, if
Marge sells Blackacre, Homer and the children lose their expectancy; they never
had an

interest to lose in the first place.

2.Life Estate. Unlike the fee simple, which is of unlimited
duration, the life estate comes to a natural end with the death of a named
person,

usually the holder of the estate. Here is an example:

Example 2 : O grants Blackacre “to Marge for life, and then
to Lisa.”

Here Marge has a life estate, followed by a remainder in fee
simple in Lisa. We return to remainders and other future interests shortly.
Note that

the life estate ends with Marge’s death; this is built in to
the life estate.

The life estate is alienable by gift or sale (but not by
will of the named person—can you see why?). What if Marge sells Blackacre
during

her life? Marge cannot sell more than she has; when Marge
dies Lisa will take. If Marge sells, the purchaser will receive a life estate
pur autre vie

—a life estate according to Marge’s, not the new owner’s,
lifespan. So the new owner will lose the property to Lisa when Marge dies. Keep
in

mind though that the life estate pur autre vie involves
Marge’s mortality risk—the duration of the right depends on when Marge will
die—and

will be correspondingly less attractive to purchasers in the
first place.

3.Defeasible Fees. The defeasible fees come in three closely
related, but for some purposes quite distinct, varieties. These interests are
like the

fee simple absolute except that they may end on the
happening of a named contingency. This leaves room for future interests to
become

possessory when such a contingency occurs.

a.Fee Simple Determinable. The fee simple determinable ends
automatically upon the occurrence of a named event, whereupon the

grantor or the grantor’s successor takes the property. This
event might never happen, in which case the fee simple determinable acts much
like

the fee simple absolute, except for the possibility of the
contingency happening.

Example 3 : O grants Blackacre “to Springfield Law School as
long as it is used for instruction in the law, then to O.”

The fee simple determinable is created using language of
duration, such as “as long as,” “so long as,” “while,” “during,” and “until.”
In

traditional parlance, this is a “limitation” rather than a
condition. (Here O has a possibility of reverter, to which we return.)

b.Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent. This
defeasible fee continues indefinitely except that, upon happening of the named

event—the condition—the interest does not automatically end
but can be ended by action (self-help or lawsuit) by the grantor or the

#511

grantor’s successor (who, as we will see, holds a future
interest called a right of entry or a power of termination).

Example 4 : O grants Blackacre “to Springfield Law School,
but if it is not used for instruction in the law, then O has the right to

reenter and take the premises.”

Here Springfield Law School has a fee simple subject to
condition subsequent and O has a right of entry (also called a “power of
termination,”

see infra). If a condo is built on Blackacre instead, then
the Law School only loses Blackacre if O (or his successor in interest) takes
action to

recover the property. With the fee simple subject to
condition subsequent, the end of the interest and the transfer to the next
interest holder is not

automatic, as it was with the fee simple determinable. The
fee simple subject to condition subsequent usually employs language of
condition

such as “but if,” “on condition that,” “provided that,”
“provided however,” and “if” (as opposed to the language of duration in the
determinable

fee, e.g., “as long as” as in Example 3), and the condition
subsequent is often separated from the description of the interest by a comma.
This

grammatical separation of the condition into its own clause
reflects the treatment of the condition as something separate from the interest
that it

can cut short.

c.Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation. If the
defeasible fee is followed by an interest not reserved to the grantor—i.e.,
granted to

some third party at the time of conveyance of the present
possessory estate—the defeasible fee is called a fee simple subject to
executory

limitation (and, as we will see, the following future
interest is called an executory interest).

Example 5A : O grants Blackacre “to Springfield Law School
as long as it is used for instruction in the law, then to the Springfield

Animal Hospital.”

Example 5B : O grants Blackacre “to Springfield Law School,
but if it is not used for instruction in the law, then to the Springfield

Animal Hospital.”

Notice that, here with the fee simple subject to executory
limitation, the future interest is in a third party, Springfield Animal
Hospital, rather than

in the grantor (as was the case with future interests in O
in Examples 3 and 4). Notice also that the fee simple subject to executory
limitation

conflates the nature of the two defeasible fees followed by
an interest reserved in the grantor (the fee simple determinable and the fee
simple

subject to condition subsequent). One can use the “as long
as” or “but if” style language interchangeably. The conventional wisdom seems
to be

that the interest is automatically cut short by the
following executory interest upon the happening of the named event, regardless
of whether

durational or conditional language is used. See Thomas F.
Bergin & Paul G. Haskell, Preface to Estates in Land and Future

#512

Interests 52 (1984). At least this is what the commentators
say; there seems to be little law on this subject.

Although seldom used, the system of estates allows interests
other than the fee simple to be determinable and subject to condition

subsequent. For example, “to A for life so long as alcohol
is not consumed on the premises” creates and grants a life estate determinable.
A lease

too can be determinable.

As mentioned earlier, the history of the forms of ownership
reflects an attempt by owners both to avoid feudal obligations and to tie up

property in their families over the generations. These
issues are reflected both in the catalogue of estates and in the doctrines,
such as rules on

alienability and the Rule against Perpetuities, that
constrain the manipulation of estates. In the past this conflict played itself
out over another

type of fee, the fee tail, which was created by the statute
De Donis Conditionalibus , 13 Edw., ch. 1, in 1285 and which acquired the
feature of

long-term inalienability by the fifteenth century. The fee
tail has been abolished in most states and has at most a theoretical existence
in the

others. To create a fee tail, one would use the language “to
A and the heirs of his/her body” or “to A and his/her issue.” Such an interest
would

give something like a nontransferable life estate to be
followed by a similar interest in the blood descendants (issue) of that person,
and so on and

on. Only when A’s bloodline ends—when A “dies without
issue,” which can happen hundreds of years after A’s death—does the fee tail
end. The

property would then revert to the grantor (or if the grantor
has died, those who have received the grantor’s reversion through a chain of
transfers

by will or under the intestacy statute). The fee tail is a
lesser estate than the fee simple absolute; the difference is a reversion in
the grantor, even

if it is not terribly likely that this reversion will ever
become possessory. Keep this in mind when we take up the principle of the
conservation of

estates. By statute, most states provide today that any
attempt to create a fee tail shall be deemed to be another interest or
interests, most

commonly a fee simple in the immediate grantee.

Future Interests

As we have seen, other than the fee simple absolute, the
other estates do not continue indefinitely but may end one way or another. This

means that compared with the fee simple absolute, there is
“something left,” and that is a future interest. These future interests come in
a

surprisingly large number of varieties. A basic division,
reflected in terminology and to a lesser extent in the rules that apply to
them, is between

interests retained by the grantor and interests created in a
third party. These differences are less important than they once were, because
interests

retained by the grantor are now generally alienable. If they
are alienated, though, they do not change their name or character. As we will
see

when we turn to the Rule against Perpetuities, interests
retained by

#513

the grantor are treated as already “vested” and so they
present no problem under the Rule.

Figure 5-3

Future Interests Retained by Grantors

### 1 .INTERESTS RETAINED BY THE GRANTOR

Not all interests give their owners a present right to
possession. Some interests do not become possessory until sometime in the
future, and

the circumstances under which this may or may not happen
help to define which interest a person has. If a person has a future interest,
one also

has to ask what present possessory interest one would have
if the interest becomes possessory, or in other words what kind of estate is in
waiting.

For example, if O grants “to A for life, and then to B,” A
has a present possessory interest in life estate and B has a remainder in fee
simple. That

is, when A dies, B will have a fee simple. B has something
now, but it is a remainder in fee simple, a future interest.

Future interests retained by the grantor are sometimes
called “reversionary” interests, even though only one of the three such
interests is

called a “reversion.” One of the pitfalls of the system of
classifying estates is the many r-words describing a number of future
interests.

a.Reversion. The reversion follows the natural end of a life
estate and in other contexts in which an owner has not disposed of the entire

fee (such as leaseholds, see Chapter VI).

Example 6 : O grants Blackacre “to Marge for life, then to
O.”

O here retains a reversion. (O could also implicitly retain
a reversion if the grant had been simply “to Marge for life.”) O had a fee
simple and

carved out a life estate, retaining the rest of the original
fee simple. The “rest” retained is a reversion. Don’t call this “rest” a
remainder. A

reversion is to be contrasted with a remainder, which is the
interest (also following a life estate) in someone other than the grantor (to
which we

return in subsection 2).

As we will see, in the lessor-lessee relationship the lessor
retains a reversion, but the lessor also has a present interest—the fee simple

subject to the lease—in addition to this reversion.

b.Possibility of Reverter. This is the interest reserved to
the grantor that follows a fee simple determinable. That is, O will

#514

automatically get the property back if the limitation built
into the fee simple determinable occurs (hence the explosion in the diagram, in
Figure

5-2, supra). In Example 3 above, repeated here, there is an
explicit possibility of reverter:

Example 3 : O grants Blackacre “to Springfield Law School as
long as it is used for instruction in the law, then to O.”

If O has died, then O’s successor (by will, intestacy, or by
sale, etc.) will take. The possibility of reverter can also be implicit:

Example 7 : O grants Blackacre “to Springfield Law School as
long as it is used for instruction in the law.”

Here O is not mentioned, but because O owned the entire fee
simple absolute and granted a fee simple determinable, O must retain a
possibility

of reverter, here implicitly. In either case, O need not do
anything to regain ownership. If the limitation event occurs (here Blackacre
ceases to be

used for law instruction), then O (or O’s successor as
holder of the future interest) becomes the fee simple owner again. Notice that
if the holder

of the fee simple determinable (here the Springfield Law
School) does not quit possession, it can start a period of adverse possession.
(See

Chapter II.) Can you see why?

c.Right of Entry/Power of Termination. Like the possibility
of reverter, this is an interest retained by the grantor that follows a
defeasible

fee, but here the preceding defeasible fee must be a fee
simple subject to condition subsequent. Consider Example 4 again:

Example 4 : O grants Blackacre “to Springfield Law School,
but if it is not used for instruction in the law, then O has the right to

reenter and take the premises.”

O has a right of entry (also called a power of termination).
The condition is a condition subsequent for the preceding interest and a
condition

precedent for the future interest—the right of entry
(represented by the lightning bolt in Figure 5-2, supra). If it occurs, nothing
happens

automatically, but it does give O the right (the power) to
change legal relations by ousting the holder of the fee simple subject to
condition

subsequent. O can either attempt a physical entry (subject
to the limits on self-help) or bring an action to recover possession of the
land. If O

does nothing, then the holder of the fee simple subject to
condition subsequent continues on as owner as before. If enough time passes,
the right

of entry may no longer be exercisable, through the doctrine
of laches. Under this doctrine, the right of entry must be exercised within a

reasonable time, which some courts take to be the period in
the statute of limitations for bringing an action in ejectment. See, e.g.,
Jeffries v.

State ex rel. Woodruff County, 226 S.W.2d 810 (Ark. 1950);
Bredell v. Kerr, 147 S.W. 105 (Mo. 1912).

#515

### 2 .INTERESTS CREATED IN A GRANTEE

The present possessory interests need not be followed by an
interest in the grantor. Instead the grantor can simultaneously create an
interest

in a third party. The set of such interests bears different
names and has somewhat different features from the otherwise similar set of
future

interests created in the grantor herself.

Figure 5-4

Future Interests in Grantees

a.Remainder. Like the reversion, the remainder follows a
life estate, never a fee simple, but unlike the reversion the remainder is in a
party

other than the grantor.

Example 8 : Marge grants Blackacre “to Homer for life, then
to Bart, Lisa, and Maggie and their heirs.”

Terminology can be confusing, because if instead of granting
the “rest” of the fee to a third party, the owner retains it, this “rest” is
not a

remainder but a reversion. Remainders come in a number of
varieties.

The remainder in Example 8 is indefeasibly vested , meaning
that the identity of the takers—Bart, Lisa, and Maggie—is known and there is

no other contingency that has to be fulfilled before the
interest is ready to become possessory other than the natural termination of
the preceding

interest (Homer’s death). Further, the remainder in Example
8 is indefeasibly vested because no condition subsequent can cut short the
remainder

(something to which we return shortly).

Other types of remainder have conditions. One common
condition, a condition precedent, makes the remainder a contingent remainder.
At

their creation, remainders can be vested or contingent.
These remainders are contingent:

Example 8A : Marge grants Blackacre “to Homer for life, then
to his children and their heirs.”

Example 8B : Marge grants Blackacre “to Homer for life, then
to Bart if he graduates from high school by age 19.”

#516

In each of these, some uncertainty remains as to the
identity of the class of takers (Example 8A) or the occurrence of the condition
(Example 8B,

assuming Bart has not graduated yet). When this uncertainty
is resolved, the remainders are said to vest in interest. We will come back to
the

distinction between vesting in interest and vesting in
possession, but for now note that uncertainty about the identity of the taker
or whether a

condition for its happening will be fulfilled—vesting in
interest—can occur without the person actually coming into possession—vesting
in

possession. For example, in Example 8B, suppose Homer is
alive and Bart has just graduated from high school at an age under 19. Bart’s

remainder is vested in interest but has not yet vested in
possession, which does not happen until Homer dies and his life estate ends.
One might

ask what would happen in Example 8B if Homer died before
Bart had a chance to graduate from high school. It may not be immediately
apparent

but the life estate and the contingent remainder in Example
8B are supported by an implicit reversion in Marge, which would take after
Homer

dies and can be divested by Bart’s graduation from high
school by age 19 (in which case Bart takes). However, if Bart reaches age 19
without

having graduated from high school, Marge’s reversion vests
indefeasibly. Remember, there always has to be someone ready to take, and if
the

grantor has not given everything away, a (supporting)
reversion is retained.

In situations like that in Example 8B, the grantor could
also use alternative contingent remainders such that one vests if the other
does not

and vice versa:

Example 8C : Marge grants Blackacre “to Homer for life, then
to Bart if he graduates from high school by age 19, otherwise to Lisa and

her heirs.”

If alternative contingent remainders appear to cover all the
bases, do they add up to a vested remainder? One might think so, but for
historical

reasons courts held that they do not, and that there is an
implied reversion in Marge in these circumstances, even though the chances of
the

reversion vesting in possession are extremely remote.^1

Some remainders are vested but not indefeasibly so. A
remainder is said to be vested “subject to complete divestment” (or “subject to

complete defeasance”) if the occurrence of a condition can
cause the interest to shift to someone else.

Example 8D : Marge grants Blackacre “to Homer for life, then
to Bart; but if Bart fails to graduate from high school by age 19, then to

Lisa.”

#517

Unlike the indefeasibly vested remainder in the three named
children in Example 8, Bart’s remainder here, a remainder subject to complete

divestment, can be cut short. But unlike the contingent
remainder in Example 8B, the condition here is a condition subsequent not a
condition

precedent: Bart’s remainder vests upon the natural
termination of the preceding estate but then can be cut short for reasons other
than the natural

termination of his own interest. (As we will see, Lisa here
has a shifting executory interest.)

As opposed to complete divestment in Example 8D, divestment
can be partial. Consider a variant on Example 8A, with a little context

added:

Example 8E : Marge grants Blackacre “to Homer for life, then
to his children and their heirs.” At the time of the grant, Homer is the

father of Bart and Lisa (but not yet Maggie).

In such a situation, what, if anything, do Bart and Lisa
have? They are part of a class “subject to open” because more members could
enter the

class (by being born as Homer’s children). Thus, Bart and
Lisa have vested remainders subject to partial divestment. The remainder is
vested

because there is no uncertainty as to their status as
children of Homer and there is no condition precedent on their remainders. But
the remainders

in Bart and Lisa are subject to partial divestment because
if more children are born to Homer they would diminish the interest of Bart and
Lisa

(e.g., from one-half to one-third, etc.). So when Maggie is
born, the vesting of her remainder partially divests those of Bart and Lisa.
Now all

three children have remainders subject to partial
divestment. When Homer dies, the remainders would vest and, assuming no more
children have

been born after Maggie, then Bart, Lisa, and Maggie would
own Blackacre in fee simple absolute.

The remainder is normally not in the grantee of the life
estate—as in “to A for life, then to A” or “to A for life, then to A’s
heirs”—both

because this would normally not be terribly useful and
because traditional doctrines would merge the two interests to reassemble a fee
simple in

A. By contrast, in Example 8 above the language “and their
heirs” serves as words of limitation and simply emphasizes that this is a
remainder in

fee simple; they are words of limitation for the
estate-in-waiting. When the interest becomes possessory it will become a fee
simple in the three

children.

b.Executory Interest. The executory interest is a future
interest in a transferee (not retained by the grantor), but, unlike the
remainder

following a life estate, which becomes possessory upon the
natural end of the preceding interest (death), the executory interest is an
interest in a

transferee (not retained by the grantor) that divests or
cuts short a previous interest (hence the ax in Figure 5-2). That is, the
executory interest

does not become possessory upon the natural end of the
preceding interest (as in the case of a remainder following the death of the
holder of a

life estate).

#518

Example 9 : Marge grants Blackacre “to Bart, but if alcohol
is ever consumed on the premises, then to Ned Flanders.”

Thus in Example 9, the defeasible fee (fee simple subject to
an executory limitation) is cut off early by the happening of the condition

subsequent, and the following interest in Ned Flanders is an
executory interest. Because the executory interest divests the interest of a
third party

(here Bart), it is a “shifting” executory interest. If the
executory interest divests an interest in the grantor, it is called a
“springing” executory

interest:

Example 9A : Marge grants Blackacre “to Bart for life,
remainder to Lisa 5 years after his death.”

Recall that there is a reversion in Marge here that would
become possessory in the 5-year period after Bart’s death. Lisa has a springing

executory interest because it divests the reversion in the
grantor (Marge).

An executory interest can cut short—bring to an unnaturally
early end—an interest that would otherwise come to a natural end (by death) as

in the following example:

Example 10 : Homer grants Blackacre “to Marge for life, but
if she remarries, then to Lisa.”

Incidentally, interests like this were allowed if they could
be taken to be motivated by a concern to support a widowed spouse until
remarriage,

but not if they seemed to be motivated out of a desire to
prevent someone’s marriage (as in “to Marge for life but if she ever marries
Ned

Flanders, then to Lisa”).

Example 1 1 : Marge grants Blackacre “to Bart as long as the
premises are not used for consuming alcohol during his lifetime, then to

Ned Flanders.”

This is another fee simple subject to an executory
limitation (using the “as long as” language) followed by an executory interest.
Notice that

because the interest in the third-party transferee becomes
possessory automatically on the happening of the condition no matter how the

triggering event is phrased (as a limitation in the
preceding interest or as a condition subsequent to the interest), there is
traditionally no future

interest in a grantee that works like the right of entry.
Again, there is little law dealing with this issue. Keep in mind, though, that
even where the

preceding interest ends without any affirmative act of the
next interest-holder, some action on her part is likely to be necessary for a
transfer and,

further down the line, in order to avoid the effect of
adverse possession.

We can summarize the discussion thus far in the chart in
Figure 5-5 (we will return to the Rule against Perpetuities later in the
Chapter).

#519

Figure 5-5

Summary of Estates and Future Interests

Vesting

One source of confusion stems from the multiple senses of
“vested.” An interest vests in possession when the interest becomes a present

possessory one. But an interest can vest in interest before
it vests in possession. Vesting in interest means that various types of
uncertainty about

the interest have been resolved. This notion of vesting in
interest is particularly important in the case of remainders. When created, a
remainder is

clearly not vested in possession; it is a future interest
that will not become possessory until the interests preceding it have
terminated. However, a

remainder may or may not be vested in interest,

#520

and much may turn on this question. In this latter sense,
“vested” means that a certain type of uncertainty about whether the interest
will ever

come to a particular individual has been resolved. This
uncertainty can stem from two main sources. First, it may be unclear who will
take the

interest when it does become possessory.

Example 12 : To A for life, then to A’s children.

If this is an inter vivos gift (one made while the grantor
is still living), there is uncertainty as to who will be a child of A at A’s
death. (Notice that

this is not a problem in the remainder in Example 8, because
there the children are listed by name. In Example 8, if more children come
along,

they do not take.) In Example 12, suppose A has children
now. The remainder is vested as to them, but more children may be born. In this

situation we would say that the remainder is vested subject
to partial divestment (or vested subject to open, as it is sometimes called).

The second type of uncertainty that prevents vesting in
interest relates to contingencies.

Example 13 : To any of my now living children who pass the
bar.

Here there is no uncertainty as to who the children are but
there is uncertainty as to whether they will pass the bar (until any such child
actually

passes it). As children pass the bar, the interest becomes
vested as to that child. Now consider this future interest:

Example 14 : To A for life, then to the children of A alive
at A’s death who have by then reached the age of 21.

The contingent remainder here combines elements of
uncertainty over both identity and reaching 21. Present children can die and
others can be

born, and any children under 21 have to reach that age. The
supporting reversion in O is considered vested.

In contrast to remainders, other future
interests—reversionary interests of various kinds and executory interests—are
much simpler as to

when they vest in interest. A reversionary interest (a
reversion, a possibility of reverter, or a right of entry) is considered vested
in interest upon

its creation, whether or not the interest ever becomes
possessory. (Such an understanding has little to recommend it these days,
particularly as

interests created in the grantor have become more fully
alienable, rendering the family connection to the grantor less distinctive in
the case of

reversionary interests.) The reality is that it is uncertain
whether they will become possessory, and that uncertainty will not be resolved
until the

contingent event occurs. Nevertheless reversionary interests
are considered vested from the moment they are created. Executory interests
present

the opposite case; normally they must become possessory
(vest in possession) in order to vest in interest.^2 As we

#521

will see, this aspect of executory interests will be very
important because executory interests can easily vest too remotely, in
violation of the Rule

against Perpetuities.

PROBLEMS

What interests are created in the following?

1 .O grants Blackacre “to A for life, then to B and his
heirs.”

2 .Same as in Question 1. Then C enters adversely. Then
thirty years later C is still on Blackacre and A, still alive, has never
entered.

3 .O grants Blackacre “to A for life, then to B and her
heirs; but if B ever remarries, then to C and her heirs.”

4 .O grants Blackacre “to Huxley College as long as it is
used for instructional purposes.”

5 .O grants Blackacre “to A; but if marijuana is inhaled on
the premises, then O shall have the right to reenter and take the premises.”

6 .O grants Blackacre “to A; but if marijuana is inhaled on
the premises during A’s life, then to B and her heirs.”

7 .O conveys Blackacre “to A for life, then to B for life,
then to C.”

8 .O grants Blackacre “to A for life, then to B for life,
then to B’s children who survive him.”

9 .O grants Blackacre “to Springfield Hospital as long as it
is used for the care of patients, then to Springfield Animal Clinic.”

10 .O grants Blackacre “to A for life, then to A’s husband
if he survives her.”

11 .O grants Blackacre “to A for life, then, if B passes the
bar, to B and his heirs as long as he remains a member in good standing of the
bar.” B is

a student in law school.

12 .Bequest (legacy) by O of “$ 100 , 000 to A, to be paid
when A reaches age twenty-one.”



```

### C. MAINTAINING THE SYSTEM

Knowing how to classify estates and interests and even how
they combine is just the beginning. Many difficulties arise when property
rights

are divided, because those with a stake are not guaranteed
to agree with each other. And in the case of future interests, the person with
the interest

may not even be born, and is unavailable for negotiation. In
this Section we consider a number of doctrines that are supposed to maintain
the

system, often by placing limits on what those dividing
property rights or enjoying the resulting pieces may do.

### 1 .CONSERVATION OF ESTATES

We have already seen how the system of estates and future
interests acts as a sort of “grammar” of property rights. One feature of the

system

#522

is that when a transfer is made, all of what the grantor had
must be accounted for, even if this means implying a reversionary interest.
That is, the

durational content of the fee simple (or other interest that
O starts out with) must be conserved. The principle of conservation of estates
ensures

that all the pieces of the estate are accounted for.

The principle of conservation applies whenever a grantor
might convey something less than her full interest. This usually happens when
the

grantor starts with a fee simple and conveys away some of
that interest. We have already seen numerous examples in which the fee owner
grants

away a life estate or a defeasible fee and retains a
reversionary interest, explicitly or implicitly. But the fee owner may retain
something other

than the “last” part of the fee simple.

Example : Marge conveys “to Bart when he reaches the age of
21.”

Here Marge has conveyed an executory interest to Bart. It is
called a springing executory interest because it follows an interest retained
by the

grantor—as opposed to a shifting executory interest, which
takes after another interest created in a third party. Here Marge has retained
what’s

left, but the piece is a present possessory interest,
probably a fee simple subject to an executory limitation. The pieces add up to
the fee simple

Marge started out with. Marge could have retained the
“middle” of the timeline as well:

Example : Homer conveys “to Abe for life, then ten years
later to Marge and her heirs.”

Here Homer has conveyed a life estate to Abe and an
executory interest in fee simple to Marge that springs from a reversionary
interest

retained by Homer. The reversionary interest would be a
reversion in fee simple subject to executory limitation. The limitation event
here is the

tenth anniversary of Abe’s death. (Notice that although this
interest is for a stated number of years it is a reversion, not a “term of
years,” which

would be a lease.) Again, the interests granted and retained
must add up to the fee simple Homer has to begin with.

While the interest retained is either a reversionary or a
present possessory interest, notice that in a conveyance, the “last” interest,
implicit or

explicit, must be a fee simple (absolute) when it becomes
possessory. If the last interest is a reversion it must be a reversion in fee
simple; if it is

a remainder or an executory interest, it must be a remainder
in fee simple or an executory interest in fee simple. If not, the chain of
interests

could come to an end with no one ready to take. Because the
whole fee is of unlimited duration, this could never happen. If a holder in fee
simple

dies without heirs, the property escheats to the state. This
is a slight echo of the feudal system, in which all owners ultimately held of
the

monarch. See In re O’Connor’s Estate, 252 N.W. 826 (Neb.
1934).

#### Williams v. Estate of Williams

```



Supreme Court of Tennessee, 1993.



865 S.W. 2 d 3.



```

■ REID,
CHIEF JUSTICE. This suit seeks the construction of the last will and testament
of G.A. Williams, deceased, and the declaration of the rights

of the parties in a tract of land described in the will.

The record does not contain all the information necessary
for the Court to adjudicate the ownership of the land. * * *

The only facts alleged are that G.A. Williams died on
November 17, 1944, the instrument attached to the complaint is a copy of his
last will

and testament, the farm mentioned in the will is located in
McMinn County, and, inferentially, the farm was owned by the testator at the
time of

his death. These allegations are admitted by Rachel Couch,
Curtis Williams, and Wayne Williams, the only defendants actually before the
Court.

Additional facts, though not proven or stipulated but
apparently not disputed by the parties before the Court, are relied upon in the
briefs.

The will was executed on July 18, 1933, and probated in the
Probate Court of McMinn County on November 24, 1944. The testator was survived

by nine children, including the three daughters named in the
will. The plaintiff, Ethel Williams, who was 92 years of age when the complaint
was

filed, is the only survivor of the three children named in
the will. The defendant Etta Tallent is the only other surviving child of the
testator, and

the other defendants are lineal descendants of the testator.
(There is no statement that the named defendants are all the heirs at law of
the testator.)

Ethel Williams has maintained possession of the farm since
the death of the testator, jointly with Ida Williams and Mallie Williams until
their

deaths. Apparently none of the three-named daughters ever
married, though that fact does not affirmatively appear.

The will is as follows:

I, G.A. WILLIAMS, being of sound mind make this my last will
and Testament: At my death I want Ida Williams, Mallie Williams,

and Ethel Williams, three of my daughters to have my home
farm where I now live, consisting of one hundred and eighty-eight acres,

to have and to hold during their lives, and not to be sold
during their lifetime. If any of them marry their interest ceases and the ones

that remain single have full control of same. I am making
this will because they have stayed at home and taken care of the home and

cared for their mother during her sickness, and I do not
want them sold out of a home. If any one tries to contest this will I want them

debarred from any interest in my estate. /s/ G.A. Williams,
July the 18, 1933.

The complaint alleged that the interest received by Ethel
Williams was a life estate under the will or, in the alternative, a life estate
under the

will and a “remainder interest” by intestate succession. The
latter

#524

disposition was adopted by the Chancellor initially, but on
rehearing was abandoned for the finding that the devise of a life estate
without

limitation over indicated an intention that the named
daughters have the property in fee simple, which is the position asserted by
Ethel Williams

on appeal.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the holding of the trial
court. It held, on the authority of White v. Brown, 559 S.W.2d 938 (Tenn.
1977), that

each named daughter owned a one-third undivided interest in
fee simple. The record does not support that decision.

The function of a suit to construe a will is to ascertain
and effect the intention of the testator. The determinative intention is the
predominant

purpose expressed by the testator in the will. Statements
regarding the means whereby the predominant purpose of the will is to be
accomplished

will not be given literal effect if they would defeat the
predominant intention. * * *

This Court stated the rule more concisely in Moore v. Neely,
370 S.W.2d 537 (Tenn. 1963):

Another rule of construction is that when a controlling or
predominate purpose of the testator is expressed, it is the duty of the court
to

effectuate that purpose, and to construe all subsidiary
clauses so as to bring them into subordination to such purpose. The language of
a

single sentence is not to control as against the evident
purpose and intent shown by the whole will.

Id. 370 S.W.2d at 540.

In the case before the Court, the predominant intention of
the testator is clear. Each of the testator’s three daughters who had “stayed
home”

was to have the farm jointly with the other two daughters,
so long as they were living and unmarried, as a residence and for their
support; after

the death or marriage of any of the three daughters, the
remaining two daughters would hold jointly until the marriage or death of
another; and

the remaining unmarried daughter was to hold until she
married or died. The statements that the farm was “not to be sold during their
lifetime”

and “I do not want them sold out of a home” emphasized and
reenforced the predominant intention that each of the three daughters have a

residence and support during her life or until she should
marry. The testator’s statement that he was favoring those children above the
others

because they had “stayed at home and taken care of... their
mother” implicitly recognized that each had foregone the opportunity to become

self-supporting or be supported by a husband, and limiting
the duration of the devise to such time as a daughter should marry, indicates
that the

devise was intended to be a substitute for support that
might otherwise have been available.

The intention of the testator was not to make an absolute
gift to all or either of the daughters. The first statement in the will limits
the devise

“during their lives.” The next statement limits the devise
to the duration

#525

of their unmarried state. The testator devised to the
daughters an interest not readily alienable and one that could not be defeated
by a suit for

partition or sale for partition. His reason for selecting
the estate devised is indicated by the statements “not to be sold during their
lifetime” and “I

do not want them sold out of a home.” Upon the death or
marriage of the named daughters, the testator’s purpose as to them would have
been

accomplished and the testator’s heirs would inherit the
property by intestate succession.

The testator recognized that his other heirs would acquire
some interest in the property upon his death. The primary emphasis was that the

daughters’ limited interests not be disturbed by the owners
of the interest not devised to the daughters. The severity of his admonition is
shown

by the provision that any person who should “contest” the
will would be “debarred” from any interest, not just in the farm but in his
estate.

This case is not controlled by White v. Brown, relied upon
by the Court of Appeals. In that case, the following provision was found to

constitute the devise of a fee simple:

“... I wish Evelyn White to have my home to live in and not
to be sold. I also leave my personal property to Sandra White Perry. My

house is not to be sold.”

559 S.W.2d at 938. The majority in White based its decision
on that portion of what is now T.C.A. § 32–3–101 (1984) which provides:

A will... shall convey all the real estate belonging to [the
testator], or in which he had any interest at his decease, unless a contrary

intention appear by its words in context.

However, in language applicable to the case before the
Court, Justice Harbison, dissenting, stated:

I have serious doubt that the testatrix intended to create
any illegal restraint on alienation or to violate any other rules of law. It
seems

to me that she rather emphatically intended to provide that
her sister-in-law was not to be able to sell the house during the lifetime of

the latter—a result which is both legal and consistent with
the creation of a life estate.

Id. at 942. That statute does not control the disposition in
the case before the Court because, as discussed above, a contrary intention
appears

from the will. The provision that each daughter’s interest
would terminate upon her marriage, as well as upon her death, is a further
indication

that the testator did not intend for the named daughters to
have an absolute estate in the farm. As stated in Page on Wills ,

The gift to A may indicate quite clearly that it is a gift
for the life of A, as where the gift is to A for life or until her marriage, or
a

gift to A for life or during her widowhood. In gifts of this
sort, A takes a life estate, since the provision with

#526

reference to marriage or widowhood is, at least, not
sufficient to overcome the effect of the provisions of the will which show that

testator intends to give to A a life estate only.

....

... By what seems to be the weight of authority, a gift to A
until her marriage or during widowhood gives a life estate to A. Such

life estate would be defeasible or determinable upon the
marriage of A.

4 William J. Bowe & Douglas H. Parker, Page on Wills, §
37.22, at 632–634 (4th ed. 1961) (footnotes omitted).

The will as a whole conveys a definite meaning. Though the
author obviously was not a skilled legal draftsman, he, also obviously, had a

good command of language and was familiar with legal phrases
commonly used and understood beyond the legal profession. The testator

accurately described the instrument he was writing as his
“last will and testament,” he asserted that he was “of sound mind,” and he
employed

the traditional words of conveyance—“to have and to hold”—in
devising an interest in real estate to the daughters. Even “contest,” though

perhaps not used accurately in its narrow, technical sense,
may indicate an action designed to defeat a testamentary disposition. The
conclusion is

almost inescapable that, had the testator intended to devise
the named beneficiaries an estate in fee, he would have expressed that
intention quite

clearly. Consequently, the estate devised to the named
daughters was less than a fee simple.

Upon the death of the testator, each named daughter held a
life estate, defeasible or determinable upon her marriage. See Id. Each
daughter

also had an executory interest in each of the other two
daughters’ one-third interest, which would vest in her possession if the other
life tenant

should die or marry while she remained unmarried. See Lewis
M. Simes & Allan F. Smith, The Law of Future Interests, § 285 (2d ed.
1956). The

heirs-at-law of the testator held a reversion in fee simple,
subject to the determinable life estates and the executory interests in the
named

daughters, which reversion would vest in possession, at the
latest, upon the death of the survivor of the named daughters. See Cornelius J.

Moynihan, Introduction to the Law of Real Property, at 94–95
(1962).

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .One principle implicit in the reasoning of both the
Tennessee Supreme Court and the appellate court is the _conservation of
estates_. Grantors may

break up their interests and transfer some or all of the
pieces, but the pieces have to add up to what the grantor started out with.
Where, as in the

_Williams_ case, someone is granting a fee simple, all of
the pieces have to add up to a fee simple. Can you see why on the Tennessee
Supreme

```



527



```

Court’s approach, but not on that of the appellate court, a
reversion in the heirs is necessary?

2 .The court believes that the will’s mention of the heirs
(and the possibility of their contesting the will) means that the testator
intended that they

would take some interest in the property under the will.
Does this follow? By definition the heirs are those who would take under the
intestacy statute.

Wouldn’t that furnish sufficient incentive for them to
contest the will—and for the testator to worry about this possibility? Do you
agree that the

testator’s use of legal terminology makes the court’s
conclusion “almost inescapable”? If not, why not?

3 .The will here is apparently a holographic will, i.e., one
handwritten by the testator. In some states, statutes provide that some of the
requirements

(such as witnesses) are dispensed with in the case of
holographic wills. Courts also tend to take a less formalistic approach in
interpreting holographic

wills. The next stage may be video and electronic wills,
which are permissible in Arizona, Florida, Indiana, and Nevada. A video will
would presumably

reduce some of the concerns about fraud and duress
associated with holographic wills. But might it introduce new concerns about
fraud? Would such

wills reduce interpretational problems like the one in
_Williams_? Or would the interpretational problems only get worse? See Adam J.
Hirsch, Technology

Adrift: In Search of a Role for Electronic Wills, 61 B.C. L.
Rev. 827 ( 2020 ).

4 .In general, will interpretation is a curious blend of
formalism and a search for the testator’s intent. See, e.g., Bruce H. Mann,
Formalities and

Formalism in the Uniform Probate Code, 142 U. Pa. L. Rev.
1033 ( 1994 ); John H. Langbein, Substantial Compliance with the Wills Act, 88
Harv. L.

Rev. 489 ( 1975 ). Among the many rules of interpretation
that courts employ is one that favors interpretations that avoid intestacy.
This canon reflects an

assumption that once a testator is expressing an intent to
dispose of her property by will, she is unlikely to be expressing a partial
intent and deliberately

invoking the intestacy laws. (Indeed, the intestacy laws are
meant in part to specify a default intent where none is expressed.) Many wills
include a

residuary clause of this sort: “I give all the rest,
residue, and remainder of my estate to... .” From the absence of such a clause,
do you think the testator

wished to create a partial intestacy here?

5 .The court asserts that the set of interests here is
inalienable during the lives of the three sisters. Should the testator be able
to prevent alienation

in this way? (We take up restraints on alienation later in
the chapter.) Notice that if the testator had employed a trust, the testator
could choose whether to

give the trustee the power of alienation.

6 .Most life estates these days are created in trust; they
are equitable as opposed to legal life estates. The major source of legal life
estates is

holographic wills. Such was the case in _Williams_. Lawyers
generally avoid legal life estates as cumbersome and litigation-prone, and will
instead

employ a trust with a lifetime beneficiary coupled with a
gift over to the same or to a third party. In a trust arrangement, the various
estates and interests

serve as methods of carving up the value of the trust
assets.

Disclaimer

One of the powers of the owner is to make a gift, but a
valid gift requires acceptance by the donee. More generally, it takes two to
transfer,

and the potential transferee has a veto over the transfer;
no one is obligated to accept a property interest. As one court put it, “[t]he
law certainly

is not so absurd as to force a man to take an estate against
his will.” Townson v. Tickell, 106 Eng. Rep. 575, 576–77 (K.B. 1819). These

principles form the basis of the law of disclaimer, under
which a potential recipient can refuse property. Disclaimer has roots in the
common law

but is now provided for by statute. States vary in terms of
whether the statutory disclaimer is the exclusive method. Statutes typically
require a

clear and unequivocal expression, and accepting any benefit
of the asset in question defeats any attempt at disclaimer. Many statutes
require

certain formalities in order to disclaim interests in real
property, such as a writing describing the property. A successful disclaimer
results in the

one disclaiming being treated as never having owned the
disclaimed interest. Why might someone disclaim an interest? In the context of
family

wealth transmission, a beneficiary might prefer the property
to go to the next taker but would like to avoid the tax consequences of a
double

transfer. A disclaimer may help avoid probate and may
prevent the disclaimant’s creditors from reaching the property. See Joan B.
Ellsworth, On

Disclaimers: Let’s Renounce I.R.C. Section 2518, 38 Vill. L.
Rev. 693 (1993). Recall also the material on abandonment; some property has a

negative value because of liabilities such as for
environmental clean-up.

### 2 .THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE ESTATE SYSTEM

As you read through the following materials ask yourself
whether the system of estates and future interests can be used to serve the
goals of

a system of property. Do we have enough devices to achieve
the objectives of those wishing to split ownership over time? Or do we, as many

argue, have too many interests? As we will see, one of the
central features of the estate system is that the menu of forms of ownership is
fixed,

finite, and closed, a doctrine known (especially in the
civil law) as the numerus clausus (closed number) of forms of property. One may
not

create a new form of ownership, in stark contrast to the
approach in contract law, in which free customizability (within broad limits)
is the norm.

Before considering why property takes this very
noncontractarian approach, one might ask how a fixed system of estates could
possibly be

flexible enough to serve people’s needs.

One reason that the system is more flexible than appears at
first blush is something known in formal language theory as recursiveness.

Consider the following example:

Example : O to A for life, then to B for life, then to C for
life.

#529

Here in effect what O has done is to carve out a life estate
and a reversion and immediately carved out another life estate for B, pushing
back the

implied reversion still further, and then done so again for
C. (If B dies before A or if C dies before either A or B, their respective
remainders in

life estate are extinguished.) One could think of the owner
employing this set of rules (out of a larger set, some of which would
correspond to the

diagrams in Figure 5-2, supra):

(i)Fee simple → Life estate + Reversion

(ii)Reversion → Life estate + Reversion

What is special about these rules is that rule (ii) can feed
itself. Rules whose output can be fed back into the rule are called recursive ,
as reflected

by the fact that Reversion appears on both sides of the
arrow in (ii). The owner in the example can be considered to have used Rule (i)
and then

Rule (ii), and then Rule (ii) again (i.e., twice). In
principle there is no limit to how many times O could carve out life estates
and push the

reversion back yet further. As a result, any set of rules
containing a recursive rule like (ii) generates an infinite set of potential
outputs.

Something similar is typically true in computer programs and
in the grammars of natural languages. Among the linguistic phenomena that call

for a model including a recursive rule is the complement
clause beginning with that : “Pat said/believed that Chris is sick,” “Leslie
said/believed

that Pat said/believed that Chris is sick,” etc. A sentence
can consist of that plus another sentence (which can in turn consist of that
plus another

sentence, etc.), with no limit in principle. While it is
certainly the case that people can make up new words, one cannot unilaterally
make up a

rule like the that rule. But the that rule (and rules like
it) permit a finite grammar to capture an infinite set of possible sentences.
So too with the

basic building blocks of property and the rules for
combining them. For a model of the estate system as a formal domain-specific
language, see

Shrutarshi Basu, Nate Foster & James Grimmelmann,
Property Conveyances as a Programming Language, in Proc. 2019 ACM SIGPLAN Int’l

Symp. on New Ideas, New Paradigms, & Reflections on
Programming and Software (Onward!) 128 (2019).

Using the Estate System for Estate Planning

The system of estates in land was primarily devised with
estate planning in mind—determining the distribution of assets that occurs when

an individual dies—and this continues to be one of its
primary functions today. Estate planning requires predictability, hence the
rule-like nature

of the system of estates in land and future interests. But
flexibility is also important. When the system was getting off the ground, land
was all-

important, and the family patriarch (land being controlled
by the husband as head of the household) would often want to assure that
Blackacre

would remain in the family to provide a source of support
(and social status) for a surviving spouse and children, and he might hope to
keep it in

the family even longer (in his dreams perhaps forever).
Today

#530

attitudes are different, but the estate system still
provides the building blocks for estate planners. Now, however, rather than
leaving Blackacre in

a series of legal estates in land, virtually all estate
planners will create a trust, either before an owner dies or as part of a will.
The corpus of the

trust is much more likely to consist of stocks, bonds,
partnership interests, and other intangible assets than Blackacre; if there is
a Blackacre, its

disposition may be regarded as a sideshow. We take up trusts
in greater detail in the next Chapter. For now, the important point is that the
trust

will give legal title to all the assets to a trustee (a
trusted family member or friend or a professional financial institution) in fee
simple, and will

describe various beneficial interests in the earnings from
the assets in a surviving spouse, children, etc., understood to be equitable
interests, not

legal interests. Importantly—and this is a primary reason
you are studying these materials—the vocabulary for describing these beneficial

equitable interests in trust incorporates the same system of
estates originally devised for freehold interests in land. Thus, lawyers and
other estate

planners will employ forms such as the life estate, the
remainder, and the executory interest in formulating an estate plan that seeks
to realize the

goals of the individual for whom such a trust is being set
up. Facility with these forms is therefore necessary to be an effective estate
planner.

One reason to use a will—with or without a trust—is to avoid
the application of the intestacy statute. Each state has an intestacy statute
that

determines the decedent’s heirs and how and when they
inherit property. The statute reflects a default presumption about what a
decedent would

wish if there had been a valid will reflecting his or her
intent. Some people’s desires diverge very much from these defaults, and such
persons

have an extra reason to need a will. Even so, studies
suggest that many if not most people in the United States die intestate. Thus,
intestacy is a

blunt instrument and the law does not favor its application.
Wills are construed to avoid intestacy. A partially invalid will can lead to
partial

intestacy.

Under the typical intestacy statute, the intestate’s
successors are the family, with priority going to the decedent’s spouse and
issue (lineal

descendants). Traditionally, the spouse would get between
one third and one half of the estate. The 1990 Uniform Probate Code Section
2–102

would increase this share to 100% under a wide variety of
circumstances including no surviving lineal descendants or parents, or no
lineal

descendants who are not also lineal descendants of the
surviving spouse. Studies suggest that this better tracks the preferences of
most people. In

the absence of any surviving spouse or issue, other
relatives are the successors. These are lineal ascendants (parents,
grandparents, and so on) and

collaterals, who are designated blood relatives who are
neither lineal descendants nor ascendants, i.e., siblings, uncles and aunts,
nephews and

nieces, cousins, and so on. Various systems exist for
determining who among these non-spouse, non-issue people succeed.

#531

Generally speaking closer blood relatives take precedence
over more distant ones, but states vary as to whether this is based on degrees
of

consanguinity or on the parentelic system. Consanguinity
counts distance in terms of the number of generations to a common ancestor
(e.g., one

between parent and child, two between grandparent and
grandchild) and if necessary down to the collateral (so degree two for a
sibling, i.e., up to

the parent and down to the sibling; three for a nephew or
niece, etc.). In the parentelic system, priority is given to those close by in
terms of

sharing a common ancestor even if the deceased and the
person in question belong to very different generations. So under the
parentelic system

grandnieces (related in the fourth degree in terms of
consanguinity) have priority over aunts (related in the third degree) because a
grandniece is

descended from the decedent’s parents but an aunt is
descended from the grandparents. For details, see Robert H. Sitkoff & Jesse
Dukeminier,

Wills Trusts, and Estates 79–89 (10th ed. 2017 ). As you can
imagine, these differences and their technical nature can lead to undesired
results for

the uninformed.

What if a spouse does have a will but leaves the surviving
spouse one dollar, or nothing at all? Generally states have a spousal elective
share

—typically one third, which the surviving spouse may (but
need not) elect. Others designated under the will then take proportionately
less. Such

elective shares replaced earlier special marital property
interests in surviving spouses, called dower and curtesy. We return to marital
property

rights in Part F of this Chapter.

What if a child predeceases a parent who then dies
intestate? The child cannot then be an heir. But intestacy statutes differ as
to how any

surviving descendants of the predeceased child will be
treated. Under one system, such children (grandchildren of the intestate) will
be allocated

shares of the estate per stirpes : under the traditional
“English” version, the estate is divided into equal shares based on the number
of children,

alive or deceased, who have descendants living at the
intestate’s death. Then any share corresponding to a predeceased child is
divided in a

similar fashion among his descendants. So if O dies with no
surviving spouse and has two living children A and B and one predeceased child
C

who left children C1 and C2, then C1 and C2 each get
one-sixth of the estate (A and B each get one-third). In a per capita system
(and more

modern versions of per stirpes) the estate is divided up
equally among the members of the generations closest to the intestate with at
least one

living member (usually the children). In the example, A, B,
C1, and C2 all get one fourth. Notice that in each system C is represented by
C1 and

C2. But any will C may have left generally has nothing to do
with how the intestate scheme works with respect to allocating O’s assets upon
her

death. These rules have evolved greatly from earlier notions
of primogeniture favoring eldest sons, especially for real estate. Modern
intestacy

laws, particularly in states using a system based on

#532

consanguinity, look more like the traditional system for
personal property, which called for equal shares among surviving children.

### 3 .THE NUMERUS CLAUSUS

The catalog of estates is finite and closed, a principle
sometimes called the numerus clausus. The term “ numerus clausus ” comes from
the

civil law which, in its various versions, exhibits a strong
and explicit principle that property, unlike contract, is not freely
customizable by parties

but rather is standardized into a closed set of approved
forms. In the common law, and U.S. law in particular, the numerus clausus is
more

implicit. Consider the following case.

#### Charles v. Barzey

```



Privy Council, United Kingdom, 2002.



[ 2002 ] UKPC 68 (Dominica).



```

■ LORD
HOFFMANN. The question in this appeal is the meaning of a devise in the will
dated 14 April 1980 of Iris Charles, who died at Elmshall,

Dominica on 11 March 1986. At the time of her death she
owned several properties. Two were in Cork Street, Roseau. One was No 9, where
she

was living at the time of her will. The other was No 18,
which was a dwelling house together with what was described in her will as an

“addition” consisting of a garage and storeroom. The access
to these additional premises was directly from the street and they were used by
her

nephew John Charles as a storeroom for the purposes of the
pharmaceutical business of a company controlled by him which occupied the

premises next door. Both the house at No 18 and the garage
and storeroom were registered in the Register of Titles in Dominica as a single
lot

and held under the same certificate of title.

She left No 9 Cork Street to John Charles absolutely. The
devise of No 18 was in these words:

I hereby give and bequeath to my niece, Mrs Yvette Barzey my
house and lot at^18 Cork Street, Roseau, Dominica. The addition to the

house where the garage and storeroom is located I give to my
nephew Mr John A. Charles to be used by him as long as he wishes.

Mrs Barzey is the sister of Mr John Charles. She claimed
that upon the true construction of the will, she took an unencumbered freehold

interest in the whole registered title and that Mr John
Charles took nothing. On 11 November 1998 she issued an originating summons in
which

she sought a declaration to this effect and an order that
she be registered with an unencumbered title.

The application came before Einfeld J on 12 March 1999. He
held that clause 4 meant that Mrs Barzey was to take the fee simple in No. 18

subject to a life interest in the garage and storeroom given
to Mr Charles.

#533

Mrs Barzey appealed to the Court of Appeal, which on 13
September 1999 allowed the appeal. The Court gave a brief judgment:

In this appeal we see no difference in facts between Da
Costa [ Da Costa v^ Warburton^ (1971)^17 WIR 334] and this case. The user of

the garage and the storeroom is repugnant to the bequest to
the appellant.

* * * The interpretation of a will is in principle no
      different from that of any other communication. The question is what a
      reasonable

person, possessed of all the background knowledge which the
testatrix might reasonably have been expected to have, would have understood
the

testatrix to have meant by the words which she used.
Furthermore, as Lord Greene MR said in In re Potter’s Will Trusts [1944] Ch 70,
77:

It is a fundamental rule in the interpretation of wills that
effect must be given, so far as possible, to the words which the testator has

used. It is equally fundamental that apparent
inconsistencies must, so far as possible, be reconciled, and that it is only
when

reconciliation is impossible that a recalcitrant provision
must be rejected. Even in that case, of two irreconcilable provisions, it is
the

later that prevails, but in the present case there is no
need to have recourse to this rule of despair.

Their Lordships think, as did Einfeld J, that there cannot
really be any doubt about what the testatrix meant. She intended Mrs Barzey to

take No 18, subject to the right of Mr Charles to use the
garage and storeroom for as long as he wished; an interest which the law will
classify as

a life interest: compare Coward v Larkman ( 1888 ) 60 LT 1
(HL). Admittedly she could have made it even clearer by using words like
“Except

that” before the second sentence of the devise. But that was
obviously her intention. It is supported by the background, which was that the
garage

and storeroom had for many years been used in connection
with the pharmacy next door and not with the house.

[One] argument[ ] against giving effect to the evident
intention of the testatrix * * * relies upon the doctrine of repugnant
conditions, as

discussed by the Court of Appeal in Da Costa v Warburton
(1971) 17 WIR 334. This doctrine is based upon the proposition that there are
certain

forms of disposition which the law will not allow. For
example, a gift which might vest more than 21 years after the death of a life
in being was

void at common law because it was considered contrary to
public policy to allow gifts to take effect at remote dates in the future. A
provision for

the divesting of property on bankruptcy is void because
contrary to the policy of the bankruptcy law. Then there are dispositions which
the law of

property simply cannot accommodate. There are a limited
number of interests which can exist as interests in property and attempts to
create

interests unknown to the law are ineffectual. Thus a gift of
land in fee simple subject to a condition that it shall not be alienated passes
an

unconditional fee simple. The condition is void because the
law does not

#534

recognise such an interest as an inalienable fee simple.
Another way of making the same point is to say that such a condition is
repugnant to the

nature of a fee simple.

These rules, of which many other examples could be given,
are not rules of construction. They are substantive rules of public policy
which

prohibit certain kinds of dispositions or the imposition of
certain kinds of conditions. In principle, the application of these rules of
public policy

comes after the question of construction. One first
ascertains the intention of the testator and then decides whether it can be
given effect. But

nowadays the existence of the rules of public policy may
influence the question of construction. If the testator’s words can be
construed in two

different ways, one of which is valid and the other void,
then unless the testator obviously did not intend to make the kind of gift
which would be

valid, the court will usually be inclined to construe his
will in that sense. The theory of the old rule against perpetuities was that
construction was

“remorseless”: one construed the will as if there was no
rule against perpetuities and then, if the gift offended, held it void. See
Gray, The Rules

Against Perpetuities (4th ed 1962 para 629). But that kind
of construction is now out of date. * * *

There is absolutely no difficulty about accommodating Iris
Charles’s intentions within ordinary property concepts. A gift of the fee
simple

in remainder, subject to a prior life interest in the whole
or part of the property in favour of someone else, is an extremely common form
of

disposition. In their Lordships’ opinion the Court of Appeal
did not heed the warning of Smith JA in Da Costa’s case (at p. 339):

One has to be careful here of arguing in a circle. It seems
to me that any direction in a will which has the effect of cutting down a

prima facie fee simple estate created by section 23 [of the
Jamaican Act, equivalent to section 29 of the Dominican Act, setting up a

presumption for a grant in fee simple] can properly be said
to be repugnant to that estate. But such a direction is not necessarily void

for repugnancy. Take a case where a testator says: ‘I give
my property at Billy Dunn to my wife’. This is followed by other bequests

and devises. Then the will says: ‘on the death of my wife my
property at Billy Dunn shall go to my son John and his heirs’. Surely, this

last devise is repugnant to the prima facie fee simple
created by section 23 in the wife’s favour! But it nevertheless shows a
contrary

intention and the wife gets a life interest only... In other
words, it must first be established that an absolute interest has been created

before the question of repugnant conditions can arise.

The present case is even simpler because the reconciliation
of the two gifts does not require any revision of the prima facie fee simple
given

to Mrs Barzey. The gift of a life interest in part of the
premises to Mr Charles merely shows that, in respect of that part of the
property, her fee

simple is to take effect in remainder. That is something
which presents

#535

no difficulty linguistically, conceptually or as a matter of
public policy. Their Lordships accordingly allow the appeal and restore the
judgment of

Einfeld J. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Why does the court hesitate over whether to recognize Mr.
Charles’s right to remain during his life? In the context of a will, the
touchstone is

supposed to be the testator’s intent. As we will see
repeatedly, property law often calls for interpretation of the intent of
someone creating a property in

terms of a given set of approved options—rather than
allowing unfettered tailoring in the way that contractual parties are free to
tailor agreements to

their particular needs. This pigeonholing exercise is often
regarded as an instance of the _numerus clausus_ principle. And yet to say that
a grantor

intended a qualification “repugnant to the fee” sounds
rather conclusory, doesn’t it? What is it about property that calls for this
more standardizing

treatment than in contract? We take up the question of
justification with the next reading.

2 .If there is a leading case for the _numerus clausus_
principle in the United States, it is _Johnson v. Whiton_ , 34 N.E. 542 (Mass.
1893 ), in which the

testator’s will contained a clause reading “After the
decease of all my children, I give, devise, and bequeath to my granddaughter
Sarah A. Whiton and

her heirs on her father’s side one-third part of all my
estate, both real and personal, and to my other grandchildren and their heirs,
respectively, the

remainder, to be divided in equal parts between them.” Id.
at 542. In a characteristically self-assured and cryptic opinion, Justice
Holmes held this to be

invalid as intended, because it purported to “create a new
kind of inheritance” reminiscent of a recently abolished version of the fee
tail. Sarah got a fee

simple instead. (Why?) As justification, Holmes pronounced
that “[i]t would be most unfortunate and unexpected if it should be discovered
at this late

day that it was possible to impose such a qualification upon
a fee, and to put it out of the power of the owners to give a clear title for
generations.” Id.

Was Holmes right about what Royal Whiton intended—or about
the effect on alienability?

3 .The doctrine of fixed estates, an aspect of the _numerus
clausus_ , is sometimes associated with the feudalism out of which the estate
system grew.

Often arguments that some feature is “repugnant” to the
nature of an estate (often the fee simple) are regarded as not only circular
but formalistic and

dustily feudal. This type of argument is in fact quite
ahistorical. In civil law the _numerus clausus_ in its modern form arose in the
efforts during and after

the French Revolution to abolish the complex feudal property
arrangements. In this country, repugnancy to the fee was the doctrinal battle
cry of those

who wanted to abolish the vestiges of feudalism in
nineteenth-century New York, where large landowners had conveyed fees but
reserved the right to

perpetual ground rents. On rent-related strife in
nineteenth-century New York, see Charles W. McCurdy, The Anti-Rent Era in New
York Law and

Politics, 1839 – 1865 ( 2001 ). These days, the main
tension, especially in civil law countries, is between the _numerus clausus_
and custom: should

customary rights not on the legislatively approved list
nevertheless receive

III.Measurement Costs, Frustration Costs, and the Optimal
Standardization of Property Rights

What accounts for the widespread adherence to the numerus
clausus , not only in the common law but in postfeudal legal systems

throughout the world? To the extent that an explanation can
be found in the American legal literature, it focuses on a concern with undue

restraints on alienation. * * *

The problem with this argument is that the system of estates
in land is sufficiently flexible that one can nearly always find a way to

effectuate a complicated conveyance. * * *

The leading English case affirming what we call the numerus
clausus principle, Keppell v. Bailey ,^102 suggests a different rationale.
Keppell

involved the conveyance of an iron works, in which the
purchasers covenanted on behalf of themselves and their successors and assigns
to

acquire all limestone required by the works from a
particular quarry and to ship the limestone to the works on a particular
railroad. The Court of

Chancery held that this type of agreement, although
enforceable as a contract between the original parties, did not fall within the
recognized

types of servitudes enforceable against subsequent
purchasers as a property right running with the land. There was, however, no
suggestion in the

case that the covenants worked an undue restraint on
alienation; indeed, the works had recently been conveyed from the original
purchasers to

another party. Instead, Lord Chancellor Brougham stressed
the more systemic consequences of allowing such “fancies,” as they have been
called,

to be enforced as property rights:

There can be no harm to allowing the fullest latitude to men
in binding themselves and their representatives, that is, their assets real

and personal, to answer in damages for breach of their
obligations. This tends to no mischief, and is a reasonable liberty to bestow;
but

great detriment would arise and much confusion of rights if
parties were allowed to invent new modes of holding and enjoying real

property, and to impress upon their lands and tenements a
peculiar character, which should follow

#537

them into all hands, however remote. Every close, every
messuage, might thus be held in [a] several fashion; and it would hardly be

possible to know what rights the acquisition of any parcel
conferred, or what obligations it imposed.^105

In modern terminology, the Lord Chancellor thought that
permitting interests like the covenants in Keppell to be established as
property rights

would create unacceptable information costs to third
parties.

In this Part, we develop Lord Chancellor Brougham’s germ of
an insight by presenting a theory of the numerus clausus based on optimal

standardization of property rights.

A.Measurement-Cost Externalities

When individuals encounter property rights, they face a
measurement problem. In order to avoid violating another’s property rights,
they

must ascertain what those rights are. In order to acquire
property rights, they must measure various attributes, ranging from the
physical

boundaries of a parcel, to use rights, to the attendant
liabilities of the owner to others (such as adjacent owners). Whether the
objective is to avoid

liability or to acquire rights, an individual will measure
the property rights until the marginal costs of additional measurement equal
the marginal

benefits. When seeking to avoid liability, the actor will
seek to minimize the sum of the costs of liability for violations of rights and
the costs of

avoiding those violations through measurement. In the
potential transfer situation, the individual will measure as long as the
marginal benefit in

reduced error costs exceeds the marginal cost of
measurement.

The need for standardization in property law stems from an
externality involving measurement costs: Parties who create new property rights

will not take into account the full magnitude of the
measurement costs they impose on strangers to the title. An example
illustrates. Suppose one

hundred people own watches. A is the sole owner of a watch
and wants to transfer some or all of the rights to use the watch to B. The law
of

personal property allows the sale of A ’s entire interest in
the watch, or the sale of a life estate in the watch, or the sale of a joint
tenancy or

tenancy in common in the watch. But suppose A wants to
create a “time-share” in the watch, which would allow B to use the watch on
Mondays

but only on Mondays (with A retaining for now the rights to
the watch on all other days). As a matter of contract law, A and B are
perfectly free

to enter into such an idiosyncratic agreement. But A and B
are not permitted by the law of personal property to create a property right in
the use

of the watch on Mondays only and to transfer this property
right from A to B.^110

#538

Why might the law restrict the freedom of A and B to create
such an unusual property right? Suppose, counterfactually, that such

idiosyncratic property rights are permitted. Word spreads
that someone has sold a Monday right in a watch, but not which of the one
hundred

owners did so. If A now decides to sell his watch, he will
have to explain that it does not include Monday rights, and this will reduce
the

attractiveness of the watch to potential buyers. Presumably,
however, A will foresee this when he sells the Monday rights, and is willing to
bear

the cost of that action in the form of a lower sales price.
But consider what will happen now when any of the other ninety-nine watch
owners try

to sell their watches. Given the awareness that someone has
created a Monday-only right, anyone else buying a watch must now also
investigate

whether any particular watch does not include Monday rights.
Thus, by allowing even one person to create an idiosyncratic property right,
the

information processing costs of all persons who have
existing or potential interests in this type of property go up. This external
cost on other

market participants forms the basis of our explanation of
the numerus clausus.

At this point, it is useful to distinguish three classes of
individuals who might be affected by the decision to create idiosyncratic
property

rights, or fancies, as illustrated by Figure 1. First are
the originating parties , who are the participants to the transaction creating
the fancy; this is

A and B in Figure 1. Second are the potential successors in
interest to the asset that is being subjected to the fancy. This would be
anyone who

might purchase A’s reserved rights (after the transfer to B
) as well as anyone who succeeds to the interest acquired by B. Potential
successors in

interest are shown as C s and D s in Figure 1. Finally,
there are the other market participants , people who will deal in or with
watches other than

the one over which A and B have transacted. Other market
participants include those selling and acquiring rights in other watches such
as E and

F and G and H in Figure 1. They also include all who must
avoid violating property rights in all watches, rights that are enforced
against the

world represented by I and J in Figure 1.^111 In the
hypothetical example above, the other market participants are the other
ninety-nine watch

owners and their successors in title, as well as anyone who
potentially might violate a property right in a watch.

The difference between other possible explanations of the
numerus clausus and our information-cost theory can be understood in terms of

this three-way classification. Other explanations focus on
the effect of novel property rights on the originating parties and potential
successors in

interest—the A s, B s, C s, and D s of the world. One may
say that these classes of individuals fall within the “zone of privity”
designated by the

box with the dotted line in Figure 1.

#539

Our explanation, in contrast, focuses on the effect of
unusual property rights on other market participants—the E s, F s, G s, H s, I
s, and J s of the

world—classes of individuals who fall outside the zone of
privity. As we argue, explanations based on classes of individuals within the
zone of

privity have difficulty identifying costs that are not
impounded into the price facing those who make the decision whether to create
the fancy in

the first place. An explanation based on costs incurred by
classes of individuals outside the zone of privity does not have this
difficulty. * * *

When A creates the Monday right, this can raise the
information costs of third parties. If the law allows A to create a Monday
interest,

individuals wishing to buy watches or bailees asked to
repair watches will have to consider the possibility that any given watch is a
Monday-only

watch (or a watch for any other proper subset of days of the
week) rather than a full-week watch. While A and B might be expected to take
into

account the market-value-lowering effect of undesirable
idiosyncratic rights when third parties like C or D consider purchasing
property in this

watch, they will not take into account the more general
effect on processing costs created by the existence of such rights when F is
considering a

purchase of rights in E ’s watch, or I and J are worried
about violating property rights.

A and B may have subjective reasons for creating property
rights based on days of the week. But, the possible existence of such rights
will

cause information costs for others—such as E , F , G , H , I
, and J —to rise. Those considering whether to purchase property rights in
watches will

have more to investigate: They will have to assure
themselves that they are getting all the days of the week that they want.
Furthermore, they will

have to worry about dimensions of division and elaboration
that perhaps no one has yet thought of, making the acquisition of any watch

#540

more uncertain as well as riskier. With an indefinite set of
types of rights, these costs will be higher than where parties, especially
unsophisticated

ones, are restricted to the limited menu the law allows.
Furthermore, because property rights are in rem, all those who might violate
property

rights, accidentally or not, must know what they are
supposed to respect. An indefinite set of types of rights will raise the cost
of preventing

violations through investigation of rights.

To return to our hypothetical world of one-hundred watch
owners, suppose the value of creating the Monday-only right to A is $10, but
the

existence of this idiosyncrasy increases processing costs by
$1 for all watch owners. The net benefit to A is $9, but the social cost is
$90. As this

example suggests, idiosyncratic property rights create a
common-pool problem. The marginal benefits of the idiosyncrasy are fully
internalized

to the owner of the property right, but the owner bears only
a fraction of the general measurement costs thereby created. Overall, the
creation of

external costs associated with this common-pool problem is
likely to proceed beyond the optimal level. The problem cannot be resolved by
side

payments from the remaining ninety-nine to A , because the
transaction costs are virtually certain to be prohibitive. Consequently, since
an

individual’s interest in creating the nonstandard right—the
extra benefit from using it rather than the next best alternative—is less than
the

additional measurement costs imposed on the other market
participants, there is a rationale for the law to prohibit the creation of this
kind of

idiosyncratic right.

One way to control the external costs of measurement to
third parties is through compulsory standardization of property rights.

Standardization reduces the costs of measuring the
attributes of such rights. Limiting the number of basic property forms allows a
market

participant or a potential violator to limit his or her
inquiry to whether the interest does or does not have the features of the forms
on the menu.

Fancies not on the closed list need not be considered
because they will not be enforced. When it comes to the basic legal dimensions
of property,

limiting the number of forms thus makes the determination of
their nature less costly. The “good” in question here might be considered to be
the

prevention of error in ascertaining the attributes of
property rights. Standardization means less measurement is required to achieve
a given

amount of error prevention. Alternatively, one can say that
standardization increases the productivity of any given level of measurement
efforts.

One would expect standardization to have the most value in
connection with the dimensions of property rights that are least visible, and

hence the most difficult for ordinary observers to measure.
The tangible attributes of property, such as its size, shape, color, or
texture, are

typically readily observable and hence can be relatively
easily measured by third parties. In the watch example, the watch can be a
Timex or a

Rolex and can be any size or color, and so forth. These
physical

#541

attributes, and of course the price, are relatively easy for
third parties to process using their senses, and thus there is less to be
gained from

standardizing them. The legal dimensions of property are
less visible and less easy to comprehend, especially when they deviate from the
most

familiar forms such as the undivided fee simple. Thus, one
would expect the effort to lower third-party information costs through
standardization

to focus on the legal dimension of ownership.

B.Frustration Costs and the Language of Property Rights

If the only concern were in reducing third-party measurement
costs, then there should be only one mandatory package of property rights,

presumably a simple usufruct or an undivided fee simple. But
standardization imposes its own costs. Mandatory rules sometimes prevent the

parties from achieving a legitimate goal cost-effectively.
Enforcing standardization can therefore frustrate the parties’ intentions.

Although the numerus clausus sometimes frustrates parties’
objectives, often those objectives can be realized by a more complex

combination of the standardized building blocks of property.
For example, sophisticated parties with good legal advice can create the
equivalent

of a lease “for the duration of the war” by entering into a
long-term lease determinable if the war ends. The fact that the numerus clausus
is in

this sense “avoidable” does not mean that it is trivial:
Even if the standardization effected by the numerus clausus principle does not
absolutely

bar the parties from realizing their ends, this
standardization comes at a price. The effect is roughly that of price
discrimination: Parties willing to

pay a great deal for an objective can achieve it by
incurring higher planning and implementation costs. Furthermore, the design and

implementation costs imposed by the numerus clausus function
as a sort of “pollution tax” that should deter parties from insisting on
overusing

hard-to-process property forms, thereby placing higher
processing burdens on market participants and especially courts. * * *

C.Optimal Standardization and the Numerus Clausus

We are now in a position to see how the numerus clausus
functions to promote the optimal standardization of property rights. From a
social

point of view, the objective should be to minimize the sum
of measurement (and error) costs, frustration costs, and administrative costs.
In other

words, what we want is not maximal standardization—or no
standardization—but optimal standardization. Fortunately, standardization comes
in

degrees. There is a spectrum of possible approaches to
property rights, ranging from total freedom of customization on the one hand to
complete

regimentation on the other. Neither of these endpoints on
the spectrum is likely to minimize social costs. Extreme standardization would
frustrate

many of the purposes to which property rights are put. On
the other hand, total freedom to customize rights would create large
third-party

measurement and error costs and high administrative costs.
Attention should focus on the middle range of the spectrum. Starting from a
position

of complete

#542

regimentation, permitting additional forms of property
rights should reduce frustration costs by more than it increases measurement
and error

costs to third parties and administrative costs. Conversely,
if one starts from a position of complete customization of rights, increasing
the degree

of standardization should lower measurement and error costs
and administrative costs by more than the attendant frustration costs will
rise. * * *

The numerus clausus principle can be seen from this
perspective as a device that moves the system of property rights in the
direction of the

optimal level of standardization * * * By creating a strong
presumption against judicial recognition of new forms of property rights, the
numerus

clausus imposes a brake on efforts by parties to proliferate
new forms of property rights. On the other hand, by grandfathering in existing
forms

of property, and permitting legislative creation of new
forms, the numerus clausus permits some positive level of diversification in
the

recognized forms of property. We do not argue that any
particular number of property forms is in fact optimal. Nor do we argue that
the forms

currently recognized by the common law are ideal and beyond
improvement. We do submit, however, that the numerus clausus strikes a rough

balance between the extremes of complete regimentation and
complete freedom of customization, and thus leads to a system of property
rights

that is closer to being optimal than that which would be
produced by either of the extreme positions.

D.Information Costs and the Dynamics of Property

Finally, our explanation of the numerus clausus generates
some general predictions about the way in which property regimes will change

over time: As the costs of standardization to the parties
and the government shift, we expect the optimal degree of standardization to
rise or fall.

Consider the rise of registers of interests in real
property, that is, recording acts. This device lowers the costs of notice; it
is an alternative method

of lowering information costs. * * *

Likewise, the more recent move toward increased use of
contract principles in areas like electronic commerce fits in well with the

information-cost theory of the numerus clausus. Notice is
arguably easier to furnish (if not to process) when, for example, rights to
digital

content are being transferred, and notice of restrictions
and other features of rights transferred are technologically not difficult to
provide. * * * In

general, to the extent that technological change allows
cheaper notice of relevant interests, the need for standardization by the law
will be

somewhat diminished. Just as the rise of land registers
allowed some loosening of the numerus clausus , so too technology that lowers

information costs can be expected to weaken the numerus
clausus further.

#543

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The _numerus clausus_ is a mandatory rule that conflicts
with the principle of freedom of contract. Why is free customizability of
contract rights

exempt from the problem of information costs? Do contracts
ever present these problems? What makes contracts relevantly different from
property? Is it

some notion of privity? For one thing the average property
right lasts a lot longer. Who is the “audience” for claims of a property sort?
Claims under a

contract? See, e.g., Thomas W. Merrill & Henry E. Smith,
The Property/Contract Interface, 101 Colum. L. Rev. 773 ( 2001 ); Carol M.
Rose, What

Government Can Do for Property (and Vice Versa), in The
Fundamental Interrelationships Between Government and Property 214 – 15

John Bell eds., 1987 ); Henry E. Smith, The Language of Property: Form,
Context, and Audience, 55

Stan. L. Rev. 1105 ( 2003 ).

2 .One alternative explanation for the _numerus clausus_ is
that it prevents excessive fragmentation. If there are too many veto-wielding
co-owners,

holdout behavior will cause a resource to be underused. As
we saw in Chapter II, this would be a mirror image of the situation with the
tragedy of the

commons, and has been termed the “tragedy of the
anticommons.” See Michael A. Heller, The Boundaries of Private Property, 108
Yale L.J. 1163 ,

1176 – 78 ( 1999 ); see also Francesco Parisi, Entropy in
Property, 50 Am. J. Comp. L. 595 ( 2002 ). Ask yourself whether the _numerus
clausus_ and the

other maintenance doctrines in this section serve to limit
the number of claimants or the number of types of property rights, or both.
Focusing only on

notice and verification costs tends to lead to skepticism
about the _numerus clausus_ , compare Merrill & Smith, 110 Yale L.J. at 43
– 51 , 54 – 58 , with Henry

Hansmann & Reinier Kraakman, Property, Contract, and
Verification: The _Numerus Clausus_ Problem and the Divisibility of Rights, 31

The _Numerus Clausus_ of Property Rights, in Comparative Property Law: Global
Perspectives

100 (Michele Graziadei & Lionel Smith, eds., 2018 ).
Others see the _numerus clausus_ as regulating the substance of property
interests, see, e.g., Nestor

M. Davidson, Standardization and Pluralism in Property Law,
61 Vand. L. Rev. 1597 ( 2008 ); Avihay Dorfman, Property and Collective
Undertaking:

( 2011 ); Joseph William Singer, Democratic Estates: Property Law in a Free and
Democratic

Society, 94 Cornell L. Rev. 1009 ( 2009 ).

3 .Another aspect of the _numerus clausus_ relates to
institutional choice. Innovation in property law does occur; for all its
antiquarian flavor, even

the estate system is quite different from what it was even
100 years ago. The _numerus clausus_ directs judges to avoid creating or
recognizing private

efforts at creating new property forms. But legislatures
have the power to do so, and the _numerus clausus_ channels innovation into the
legislative arena.

Consider some examples. The abolition of the fee tail was
accomplished by statute, not by judicial decision. As another example, the
nineteenth century

saw many innovations in marital property. The older

```



544



```

interests were dower, which gave a surviving wife a life
estate in one third of the real property held by the husband, and curtesy,
which among other

things gave a widower a life estate in the wife’s land.
Eventually, legislatures abolished these forms of property and replaced them
with gender-neutral

statutes creating a surviving spouse’s forced share (usually
one third) of the deceased spouse’s estate. A surviving spouse of either gender
can now elect

to take either what the will provides or ownership of one
third of the estate. See, e.g., June R. Carbone & Margaret F. Brinig,
Rethinking Marriage:

Feminist Ideology, Economic Change, and Divorce Reform, 65
Tul. L. Rev. 953 , 1010 ( 1991 ).

4 .Is it a good idea to give legislatures primary
responsibility for creating and destroying forms of property? Elsewhere in the
excerpted article,

Merrill and Smith argue that making legislatures rather than
courts the source of legal change affords the benefits of clarity,
universality,

comprehensiveness, stability, prospectivity, and implicit
compensation. See Merrill & Smith, _Numerus Clausus_ , supra, at 58 – 68.
Can you think of

contrary arguments that might support giving courts a more
active role here? Keep these questions of institutional choice in mind when we
discuss

developments in landlord-tenant law and condominiums in the
next chapter.

5 .The status of the _numerus clausus_ as a largely
unacknowledged design principle in Anglo-American law has numerous implications
for its

operation. For example, one of the traditional maxims
observed by the courts of equity was that equity will modify property rights
less readily than

contracts. The implicit approach to the _numerus clausus_
also leads courts to downplay or confuse the principle when seeking to
streamline doctrine in

the name of party intent. As a prominent example, in _Garner
v. Gerrish_ , 473 N.E. 2 d 223 (N.Y. 1984 ), the deceased, Donovan, had signed
a lease with

Gerrish “ ‘for and during the term of _quiet enjoyment_ from
the _first_ day of _May,_ 1977 which term will end— _Lou Gerrish has the
privilege of termination

[sic] this agreement at a date of his own choice_ ’
(emphasis added to indicate handwritten and typewritten additions to the
printed form).” Id. at 577.

Garner, the executor of the estate on behalf of Donovan’s
widow, argued that the tenancy was at will because traditionally a lease at
will on one side was

at will on both. With dismissive noises about livery of
seisin and dusty feudalism, the court saw no difference between the interest
and a life estate and

enforced it as written, allowing Gerrish to stay. Unanswered
was whether a “lease for life” would carry with it all the tenant protections
we will

encounter in the next chapter. More generally, what is the
harm in creating a “lease for life” if that is not on the menu the law affords?
In a fascinating

recent article, Bernie Jones unearths more about the
relationship between Gerrish and Donovan which suggests, contrary to the
court’s implicit treatment

of the case as one calling for tenant protection against a
landlord, that Gerrish may have exercised undue influence as caretaker of a
very ill and impaired

Donovan. Bernie D. Jones, Garner v. Gerrish and the Renter’s
Life Estate: Teaching a New Concept of ‘Home’, 2 Faulkner U. L. Rev. 1 ( 2010
). Would

the court have done better to apply the traditional rule and
find an at-will tenancy? Should courts try to reach nuanced decisions like the
one in _Garner_

when many lawyers (like the one

```



545



```

in that case) are not up to the job of showing undue
influence or unconscionability in such arrangements?

6 .The more common approach to problems like the
lease-for-life is to construe the interest as fitting in the closest of the
boxes provided by the

estate system through the _numerus clausus_. What would be
closest to a lease for life? Compare Thompson v. Baxter, 119 N.W. 797 (Minn.
1909 ) (life

estate) with Kajo Church Square, Inc. v. Walker, 2003 WL
1848555 (Tex. Ct. App.) (tenancy at will); Nitschke v. Doggett, 489 S.W. 2 d
335 (Tex. Civ.

App. 1972 ), vacated on other grounds, 498 S.W. 2 d 339
(Tex. 1973 ) (same). Although it is uncommon for professional drafters—being a
cautious lot—to

create new estates or fancies, one recurring problem comes
from attempts during various wars to create a lease for the duration of the
war. As we will

see, leases come in four varieties, and a lease for the
duration of the war is not one of them. Most courts will deem such leases to be
a tenancy at will (a

type of lease). See, e.g., National Bellas Hess v. Kalis,
191 F. 2 d 739 ( 8 th Cir. 1951 ); Stanmeyer v. Davis, 53 N.E. 2 d 22 (Ill.
App. Ct. 1944 ); Lace v.

Chandler, 1 All E.R. 305 (K.B. 1944 ). The minority of
courts that have upheld such leases as a lease for a term of years have
generally done so by

changing the definition of a term of years rather than by
holding that the parties may freely contract for new types of leases. See,
e.g., Smith’s Transfer

& Storage Co. v. Hawkins, 50 A. 2 d 267 , 268 (D.C. App.
1946 ). What would be the harm in a lease “for the duration of the war”?

Personal Property

The menu of forms of property for real estate is
lengthy—very probably too lengthy. What about personal property? Does the
system of

estates, developed in the context of land, also apply to
personal property? There is surprisingly little authority on the question of
how far the

system of estates applies to personal property. Some
standard reference works state that personal property is subject to the same
elaborate

structure of forms that applies to estates in land
(including future interests). See Restatement (First) of Property § 9 cmt. a,
at 23 (1936); 2

William Blackstone, Commentaries *398. But case law does not
fully support this broad proposition. One can find decisions upholding future

interests in personal property. For example, in Gruen v.
Gruen , 496 N.E.2d 869 (N.Y. 1986), the court upheld the inter vivos gift of a
remainder

in a painting following a retained life estate in the donor.
But such decisions are rare. See generally John Chipman Gray, Future Interests
in

Personal Property, 14 Harv. L. Rev. 397 (1901).

In one respect, there is no doubt that the estate system
applies to personal property. As has been mentioned, most trusts today consist
of

assets that would be described as personal rather than real
property—stocks, bonds, money markets funds, and other investment vehicles. The

beneficial interests in these trusts are described in terms
of the estates in land, such as life estates, remainders, and executory
interests. So the

estate system unquestionably applies to equitable interests
in personal property held in trust. To the extent one wishes to create divided

#546

ownership in a particularly valuable piece of personal
property like a painting or other collectible, it would almost certainly be
advisable to use a

trust to do this, rather than attempt to create divided
legal title using the forms of property recognized for freehold interests.

Why is there not more authority on point with respect future
interests in common law personal property? Our knowledge of the early history

is limited by the tendency for litigation over items like
farm equipment, produce, and animals to take place in local courts with less
record

keeping. Likewise title in such items typically was less
elaborate than in the case of land. Most personal property does not last as
long as land

does, so there is typically less incentive to specify who
will take personal property in future generations. Thus, an additional source
of

indifference to future interests in personal property
probably stemmed from their perishable nature and the high ratio of
complication to benefit

in such interests.

The analog of the fee simple absolute is “absolute
ownership” (also called “full ownership”) of personal property. As best we
know, the

original understanding seems to have been that personal
property could not be divided into lesser interests. To get around this rule,
people would

occasionally use bailments, because the bailor was
considered to retain the fee-like ownership during the bailment. Beginning in
the fifteenth

century, gifts by will of the use and occupancy of personal
property for the life of the grantee were allowed. In the nineteenth century
some

English courts treated such bequests as giving an absolute
interest to the intended life recipient and an executory interest to the
intended future

interest holder. Only later did some courts in England and
the United States treat inter vivos gifts with similar accommodation. For a
more

detailed treatment, see Thomas F. Bergin & Paul G.
Haskell, Preface to Estates in Land and Future Interests 121–22 (2d ed. 1984);
Lewis M.

Simes & Allan F. Smith, The Law of Future Interests
(John A. Borron, Jr., ed., 3d ed. 2002).

Even today, courts apply some restrictions on the creation
of future interests in personal property. All courts follow the rule that a
future

interest cannot be created in a “consumable” item. This rule
can have real bite when testators are setting up trusts. If the will creates a
trust out of

all the “rest and residue” of the testator’s property, this
is likely to include “not only securities or other assets that are appropriate
for a trust, but

also such egregiously inappropriate items as collar buttons,
pet cats, and frying pans... .” Ashbel Green Gulliver, Cases and Materials on
the

Law of Future Interests 68 (1959). Given that one cannot
create a future interest in a consumable, this makes for entertaining
line-drawing

exercises, with food and current crops on one side, diamonds
on the other, and conflicting views on farming implements and animals. The

solution is to make specific grants of the personal
property.

Another limitation involves attempts to create easements or
analogous restrictions on the use of items of personal property that would

#547

follow (“run with”) the item into remote hands. English
courts have said this is impermissible, and this seems to be the tendency in
the United

States. See, e.g., Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park, 220 U.S.
373, 404 (1911), overruled by Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS,
Inc.,

551 U.S. 877 (2007); Zechariah Chafee, Jr., Equitable
Servitudes on Chattels, 41 Harv. L. Rev. 945, 977–980 (1928); Zechariah Chafee,
Jr., The

Music Goes Round and Round: Equitable Servitudes and
Chattels, 69 Harv. L. Rev. 1250 (1956) (commenting on a decision departing from
the

general understanding). This has been particularly
contentious in the area of software licensing. Compare Glen O. Robinson,
Personal Property

Servitudes, 71 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1449 (2004) (arguing for
enforceability) with Julie E. Cohen, Lochner in Cyberspace: The New Economic

Orthodoxy of “Rights Management,” 97 Mich. L. Rev. 462
(1998) (criticizing tendency to provide legal support for private efforts to
enclose

information). The informational problems presented by
servitudes in intellectual property are sometimes different from those in
tangible

property; in particular, increasingly popular public
licenses—under which a copyright holder will license to anyone on condition
that the

incorporating work be licensed on the same terms—can
potentially conflict with each other, by imposing inconsistent obligations on
the creator

of the later incorporating work. In another problem
particular to IP, consumers in particular may be surprised to know that they
have agreed not

to engage in what would otherwise be fair use. Molly Shaffer
Van Houweling, The New Servitudes, 96 Geo. L.J. 885, 946–47 (2008).

A general concern raised by the possibility of creating
nonpossessory property rights in items of personal property is the problem of
notice.

Such property rights are in rem, but how are dutyholders
supposed to know the content of the right? As we will see, in the case of land
the notice

function is largely served by registries of documents
evidencing rights in land. For most types of personal property, such registries
are not

available, although that may change with the heralded rise
of the Internet of Things. Christina M. Mulligan, Personal Property Servitudes
on the

Internet of Things, 50 Ga. L. Rev. 1121 (2016). The more
valuable, durable, and immobile an asset, the more likely there will be a
registry.

Planes, automobiles, and increasingly valuable art works are
subject to registries that one can consult to learn about the various interests
of other

parties in the assets. But other types of personal property
have no registries, making it especially perilous to impose in rem duties on
persons with

respect to such property when they have no way of knowing
which items are restricted and which ones are not.

### D. MEDIATING CONFLICTS OVER TIME

### 1 .WASTE

When two or more persons hold interests in a single piece of
property there is always potential for conflict. This is certainly true when a

#548

grantor divides a fee simple into a life estate and one or
more remainders. The holder of the life estate will tend to favor current
consumption and

investments that produce a quick return. In contrast, the
holders of remainders are likely to prefer conservation of the asset and
longer-term

investments. This conflict may be mitigated somewhat when,
as is often the case, the parties are closely related; for example, the life
tenant is the

grantor’s spouse and the holders of the remainders are the
couple’s children. But intra-familial conflict also occurs, as the following
case

demonstrates. Here one Isaac V. Brokaw built several
adjacent mansions. By will, he left to each of his four children—three sons and
a daughter

—a life interest in one of four separate dwelling houses.
Each life estate was followed by a remainder to the issue of the life tenant.
The will

provided that if any of the life tenants should die without
issue, the remaining heirs of Isaac would get that house. Thus, in the
following case, the

plaintiff (Isaac’s son George) had a life estate, followed
by a contingent remainder in George’s children, subject in turn to a contingent
remainder

in the three other children of testator Isaac and their
issue living at the time of George’s death if George should survive his
children. It is these

holders of the contingent remainders who object to the
razing of the allegedly obsolete mansion.

135 Misc. 70 , 237 N.Y.S. 6.



```

■
HAMMER, J. This is an action under section 473 of the Civil Practice Act and
Rules of Civil Practice 210 to 212, in which plaintiff asks that it be

declared and adjudged that the plaintiff, upon giving such
security as the court may direct, has the right and is authorized to remove the
present

structures and improvements on or affecting the real
property No. 1 East Seventy-Ninth street, or any part thereof, except the party
wall, and to

erect new structures and improvements thereon in accordance
with certain proposed plans and specifications. * * *

In the year 1886 the late Isaac V. Brokaw bought for
$199,000 a plot of ground in the borough of Manhattan, city of New York,
opposite

Central Park, having a frontage of 102 feet 2 inches on the
easterly side of Fifth avenue and a depth of 150 feet on the northerly side of
Seventy-

Ninth street. Opposite there is an entrance to the park and
Seventy-Ninth street is a wide crosstown street running through the park. Upon
the

corner portion, a plot of ground 51 feet 2 inches on Fifth
avenue and a depth of 110 feet on Seventy-Ninth street, Mr. Brokaw erected in
the year

1887, for his own occupancy, a residence known as No. 1 East
Seventy-Ninth street, at a cost of over $300,000. That residence and corner
plot is

the subject-matter of this action. The residence, a
three-story, mansard and basement granite front building, occupies the entire
width of the lot.

The mansard roof is of tile. On the first floor are two
large drawing rooms on the Fifth avenue side, and there are also a large

#549

hallway running through from south to north, a reception
room, dining room, and pantry. The dining room is paneled with carved wood. The

hallway is in Italian marble and mosaic. There are murals
and ceiling panels. There is a small elevator to the upper portion of the
house. On the

second floor are a large library, a large bedroom with bath
on the Fifth avenue side, and there are also four other bedrooms and baths. The
third

floor has bedrooms and baths. The fourth floor has servants’
quarters, bath, and storage rooms. The building has steam heat installed by the

plaintiff, electric light and current, hardwood floors, and
all usual conveniences. It is an exceedingly fine house, in construction and
general

condition as fine as anything in New York. It is contended
by plaintiff that the decorations are heavy, not of a type now required by
similar

residences, and did not appeal to the people to whom it was
endeavored to rent the building. It is “a masonry house of the old-fashioned
type

with very thick walls and heavy reveals in the windows, very
high ceilings, monumental staircase and large rooms.” “Such as has not been
built

for probably twenty-five years.” “Utterly impractical to
remodel for occupancy by more than one family.” It “was offered to a great many
people

for rental at $25,000 with the statement that a lower figure
might be considered and no offer of rental was obtained. Mr. Brokaw (the
plaintiff)

directed that the asking rental be $30,000 to start and
finally reduced to $20,000. There is no demand for rental of private houses.
There is a

sporadic demand for purchase and sale on Fifth avenue for
use as private homes. Once in a while somebody will want a private house.” The
taxes

are $16,881, upkeep for repairs $750, and watchman $300. The
taxes for 1913 were $8,950.77.

Since 1913, the year of the death of Isaac V. Brokaw and the
commencement of the life estate of plaintiff, there has been a change of

circumstances and conditions in connection with Fifth avenue
properties. Apartments were erected with great rapidity and the building of
private

residences has practically ceased. Forty-four apartments and
only 2 private residences have been erected on Fifth avenue from Fifty-Ninth
street

to 110 th street. There are to-day but 8 of these 51 blocks
devoted exclusively to private residences. Plaintiff’s expert testified: “It is
not possible

to get an adequate return on the value of that land by any
type of improvement other than an apartment house. The structure proposed in
the plans

of plaintiff is proper and suitable for the site and show
172 rooms which would rent for $1,000 per room. There is an excellent demand
for such

apartments. * * * There is no corner in the City of New York
as fine for an apartment house as that particular corner.”

The plaintiff testified also that his expenses in operating
the residence which is unproductive would be at least $70,542 greater than if
he

resided in an apartment. He claims such difference
constitutes a loss and contends that the erected apartment house would change
this loss into

an income or profit of $30,000. Plaintiff claims that under
the facts and changed conditions shown the demolition of the building and

#550

erection of the proposed apartment is for the best interests
of himself as life tenant, the inheritance, and the remaindermen. The
defendants deny

these contentions and assert certain affirmative defenses:
(1) That the proposed demolition of the residence is waste, which against the
objection

of the adult defendant remaindermen plaintiff cannot be
permitted to accomplish. * * *

Coming, therefore, to plaintiff’s claimed right to demolish
the present residence and to erect in its place the proposed apartment, I am of
the

opinion that such demolition would result in such an injury
to the inheritance as under the authorities would constitute waste. The life
estate

given to plaintiff under the terms of the will and codicil
is not merely in the corner plot of ground with improvements thereon, but,
without

question, in the residence of the testator. Four times in
the devising clause the testator used the words “my residence.” This emphasis
makes

misunderstanding impossible. The identical building which
was erected and occupied by the testator in his lifetime and the plot of ground
upon

which it was built constitute that residence. By no stretch
of the imagination could “my residence” be in existence at the end of the life
tenancy

were the present building demolished and any other
structure, even the proposed 13-story apartment, erected on the site.

It has been generally recognized that any act of the life
tenant which does permanent injury to the inheritance is waste. The law intends
that

the life tenant shall enjoy his estate in such a reasonable
manner that the land shall pass to the reversioner or remainderman as nearly as

practicable unimpaired in its nature, character, and
improvements. The general rule in this country is that the life tenant may do
whatever is

required for the general use and enjoyment of his estate as
he received it. The use of the estate he received is contemplated, and not the
exercise

of an act of dominion or ownership. What the life tenant may
do in the future in the way of improving or adding value to the estate is not
the test

of what constitutes waste. The act of the tenant in changing
the estate, and whether or not such act is lawful or unlawful, i. e. , whether
the estate

is so changed as to be an injury to the inheritance, is the
sole question involved. The tenant has no right to exercise an act of
ownership. In the

instant case the inheritance was the residence of the
testator—“my residence”—consisting of the present building on a plot of ground
51 feet 2

inches on Fifth avenue by 110 feet on Seventy-ninth street.
“My residence,” such is what the plaintiff under the testator’s will has the
use of for

life. He is entitled to use the building and plot reasonably
for his own convenience or profit. To demolish that building and erect upon the
land

another building, even one such as the contemplated 13-story
apartment house, would be the exercise of an act of ownership and dominion. It

would change the inheritance or thing, the use of which was
given to the plaintiff as tenant for life, so that the inheritance or thing
could not be

delivered to the remaindermen or reversioners at the end of
the life estate. The receipt by them at the end

#551

of the life estate of a 13-story $900,000 apartment house
might be more beneficial to them. Financially, the objecting adults may be
unwise in not

consenting to the proposed change. They may be selfish and
unmindful that in the normal course of time and events they probably will not

receive the fee. With motives and purposes the court is not
concerned. In Matter of Brokaw’s Will, 219 N.Y.S. 734 (N.Y. App. Div. 1927);
affd.,

157 N. E. 880 (N.Y. 1927), their right to object to a
proposed building loan and mortgage for the erection of the proposed apartment
was

established by decision. They have the same right of
objection in this action. To tear down and demolish the present building, which
cost at least

$300,000 to erect and would cost at least as much to
replace, under the facts in this case, is clearly and beyond question an act of
waste. In

Winship v. Pitts , 3 Paige, Ch. 259 (N.Y. Ch. 1832),
Chancellor Walworth, although holding that an injunction was properly refused
to restrict the

erection of a building upon premises where the lease did not
specifically limit the use thereof, nevertheless (at page 262 of 3 Paige Ch.)
said: “I

have no hesitation in saying, that by the law of this state,
as now understood, it is not waste for the tenant to erect a new edifice upon
the demised

premises; provided it can be done without destroying or
materially injuring the buildings or other improvements already existing
thereon. I admit

he has no right to pull down valuable buildings, or to make
improvements or alterations which will materially and permanently change the

nature of the property, so as to render it impossible for
him to restore the same premises, substantially, at the expiration of the term
.” (Italics

mine.)

In Agate v. Lowenbein, 57 N.Y. 604, 607 (1874), the court
said: “Had there been no license given to the defendants to do the acts of
which

the plaintiff complains, the injuries done to the property
would have been, apparently, acts of waste, for which the plaintiff could, by
the rules of

the common law, have brought an action on the case in the
nature of waste. The right which the tenant has is to make use of the property.
The

power of making an alteration does not arise out of a mere
right of user; it is, therefore, incompatible with his interest for a tenant to
make any

alteration, unless he is justified by the express permission
of his landlord. Holroyd, J., in Farrant v. Thompson (5 B. & Ald., 826, 106
Eng. Rep.

1392 (K.B. 1822)) defines the extent of a lessee’s rights.
By a lease, the use, not dominion of the property demised, is conferred. If a
tenant

exercises an act of ownership, he is no longer protected by
his tenancy.”

And at page 614 of 57 N.Y., the court said: “It is, in
general, no justification for an act of waste that a party will, at some future
time, put the

premises in the same condition as they were when the lease
was made. The question is, whether the tenant, at the time the wrongful act was
done,

caused an injury which then affected the plaintiff as to his
reversion. * * * The tenant has no right to exercise an act of ownership.”

In Kidd v. Dennison , 6 Barb. 9, 13 (N.Y. Sup. 1849), the
court said: “So if the tenant materially changes the nature and character of
the

#552

buildings, it is waste, although the value of the property
should be enhanced by the alteration. * * * The tenant has no authority to
assume the

right of judging what may be an improvement to the
inheritance. He must confine himself to the conditions of his lease.” * * *

The cases given by plaintiff are either cases where a
prohibitory injunction against future waste has been sought and the parties
have been

refused the injunction and relegated to an action for
damages for waste, or where, in condemnation proceedings or actions in equity,
it appears

that the equities between the parties are such that the
technical waste committed has been ameliorated. The three cases upon which the
plaintiff

principally relies are Melms v. Pabst Brewing Co., 79 N. W.
738 (Wis. 1899), and New York, O. & W. R. Co. v. Livingston, 144 N. E. 589
(N.Y.

1924), and Doherty v. Allman, 3 L. R. App. Cas. 709, 71 7,
721 (H.L. 1878). These are readily distinguishable from the case at bar. In
Melms v.

Pabst Brewing Co., supra, there was a large expensive brick
dwelling house built by one Melms in the year 1864. He also owned the adjoining

real estate and a brewery upon part of the premises. He died
in 1869. The brewery and dwelling were sold and conveyed to Pabst Brewing

Company. The Pabst Company used the brewery part of the
premises. About the year 1890 the neighborhood about the dwelling house had so

changed in character that it was situated on an isolated lot
standing from 20 to 30 feet above the level of the street, the balance of the
property

having been graded down to fit it for business purposes. It
was surrounded by business property, factories, and railroad tracks with no
other

dwellings in the neighborhood. Pabst Brewing Company, in
good faith regarding itself as the owner, tore down the building and graded
down the

ground for business purposes. Thereafter it was held, in the
action of Melms v. Pabst Brewing Co., 66 N. W. 244, that the brewing company
had

only acquired a life estate in the homestead, although in
another action between the same parties ( 66 N. W. 518 (Wis. 1896)) it was held
that as to

the other property the brewing company had acquired full
title in fee. The action for waste in which the [1899 decision] was delivered
was

brought and decided after the decisions in the other
actions. We find it there said at 79 N. W. 738: “The action was tried before
the court without

a jury, and the court found, in addition to the facts above
stated, that the removal of the building and the grading down of the earth was
done by

the defendant in 1891 and 1892, believing itself to be the
owner in fee simple of the property, and that by the said acts the estate of
the plaintiffs

in the property was substantially increased, and that the
plaintiffs have been in no way injured thereby.”

Again, it was stated at 79 N. W. 740: “There are no contract
relations in the present case. The defendants are the grantees of a life
estate, and

their rights may continue for a number of years. The
evidence shows that the property became valueless for the purpose of residence
property as

the result of the growth and development of a great city.
Business and manufacturing interests advanced and surrounded the once elegant

#553

mansion, until it stood isolated and alone, standing upon
just enough ground to support it, and surrounded by factories and railroad
tracks,

absolutely undesirable as a residence, and incapable of any
use as business property. Here was a complete change of conditions, not
produced by

the tenant, but resulting from causes which none could
control. Can it be reasonably or logically said that this entire change of
condition is to be

completely ignored, and the ironclad rule applied that the
tenant can make no change in the uses of the property because he will destroy
its

identity? Must the tenant stand by, and preserve the useless
dwelling house, so that he may at some future time turn it over to the
reversioner,

equally useless?”

The facts in the above case are clearly not analogous to the
facts here. Especially is this recognized from the fact that the plaintiff’s
dwelling

house is far from being “isolated and alone, standing upon
just enough ground to support it, surrounded by factories and railroad tracks,

absolutely undesirable as a residence.” It is located on the
northeast corner of Fifth avenue and Seventy-ninth street. Across the avenue to
the

west is Central Park. To the south across Seventy-ninth
street the block Seventy-eighth to Seventy-ninth streets is restricted to
private dwellings.

The residence itself is surrounded by the three other
palatial Brokaw dwellings, forming a magnificent residential layout of the four
plots. It may,

of course, be that the situation will change in the future.
The decision here is concerned only with the present. * * *

The facts, it is seen, in none of the cases cited are
analogous to the case at bar. The law and procedure therein also contain no
analogy.

Melms v. Pabst Brewing Co. was a law action for waste
claimed to have been committed prior to the action. Upon the existing facts
proved at the

trial it was found as fact and in equity that the claimed
waste was ameliorated and the plaintiff not damaged. * * *

From the foregoing I am of the opinion, and it will
accordingly be adjudged and declared, that upon the present facts,
circumstances, and

conditions as they exist and are shown in this case,
regardless of the proposed security and the expressed purpose of erecting the
proposed 13-

story apartment, or any other structure, the plaintiff has
no right and is not authorized to remove the present structures on or affecting
the real

estate in question. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .George Brokaw’s repeated efforts to persuade the courts
to permit him to tear the house down were all rebuffed. He lived in the house
until his

death in 1935 , but neither he nor his wife liked it. The
Brokaws divorced in 1929 , and Mrs. Brokaw later remarried and went on to
greater fame as Clare

Boothe Luce. George and Clare had two children, who took
ownership of the mansion when George died. One of the children died in 1944 ,
and left her

half interest in the mansion to Clare by will. Clare sold
this to her second husband, Henry Luce, the publisher of _Time_ magazine, and
he eventually

purchased the other half-interest from George’s other child.
In 1964 , although the house had been designated a landmark by the city, new
owners

managed to raze the building along with two adjoining
mansions, over the objections of the New York City Landmarks Preservation
Commission. A

large apartment building now stands on the site. Thomas W.
Ennis, Landmark Mansion on 79 th St. To Be Razed, N.Y. Times (Sept. 17 , 1964
), at 1.

2 .Who should have standing to bring an action for waste?
The original action for waste, following the Statute of Gloucester, 6 Edw. I,
ch. 5

( 1278 ), provided for forfeiture of the estate of one
guilty of waste, plus the payment of treble damages to those holding affected
nonpossessory interests.

Perhaps because of the severity of the remedy, courts held
that only those holding indefeasibly vested remainders or reversions had
standing to bring an

action for waste. Later, when the Chancery Court began to
issue injunctions against the commission of waste by a tenant-in-possession,
the standing

rules were relaxed, and holders of contingent remainders,
defeasible reversions, or executory interests were allowed to sue, provided
they sued on behalf

of all nonpossessory interest holders. See Dale A. Whitman
et al., The Law of Property 129 – 32 ( 4 th ed. 2019 ). This appears to be the
understanding that

allowed the contingent remaindermen in _Brokaw_ to bring an
action to enjoin George Brokaw from committing waste. But suppose someone with
only a

possibility of reverter or an executory interest with a
highly remote chance of ever becoming vested seeks to bring an action for
waste. Where should the

courts draw the line in granting standing to regulate the
behavior of the tenant-in-possession?

3 .The action for waste is very old, dating from the twelfth
century, and originally had its own writ—the writ of waste. It remains today an

important background rule that defines the respective rights
of persons who hold possessory and nonpossessory interests in property. The
action for

waste can be invoked not only by holders of remainders
following life estates: It applies in any situation of concurrent or sequential
ownership,

including lessors objecting to actions by lessees that the
lessor claims will damage the lessor’s reversion. Increasingly, however, the
issues that could be

adjudicated by an action for waste are resolved by contract
instead. Insofar as property is divided between a life tenant and a remainder,
today it will

typically be held in trust, and the trust agreement (in a
sense a contract between the settlor of the trust and the trustee to manage
property in the interests

of the beneficiaries) will specify the duties of
preservation or rights of modification of the property being managed by the
trustee. Generally,

```



556



```

trustees are subject to fiduciary duties relating to
management. And nearly all lessors will specify in the lease whether the lessee
has a duty to repair or

otherwise maintain the property and what degree of latitude
the lessee has to make modifications in the property. So the issues covered by
the action for

waste are usually resolved today by interpreting a trust or
a lease, although the duties created by the law of waste can be called upon if
there is a gap in

these instruments. And the action for waste creates the
baseline understanding against which these agreements are negotiated.

4 .Courts over time have developed different categories of
waste. The basic distinction is between affirmative waste and permissive waste.

_Affirmative waste_ is a type of misfeasance. It occurs when
the life tenant or lessee undertakes some affirmative act on the property that
is unreasonable

and causes “excess” damage to the reversionary or remainder
interest. The actions that constitute affirmative waste are often defined in
terms of what is

regarded as “normal” use of the property. Thus, if the
property contains minerals or trees, the life tenant or lessee is permitted to
engage in normal

extraction of minerals and normal tree-cutting, but anything
beyond normal would be affirmative waste. One rule of thumb, the “open mines”
doctrine,

provided that any extraction of minerals was waste unless
mining was already occurring on the land at the beginning of the life estate or
lease.

_Permissive waste_ is a type of nonfeasance. It occurs when
the life tenant or lessee fails to take some action with regard to the property
and the failure to

act is unreasonable and causes excess damage to the
reversion or remainder. Again, rough conceptions of normal behavior serve to
define the baseline

against which liability is to be determined. Prominent
examples of permissive waste include failing to repair a roof resulting in
water damage, not

paying taxes as they come due, or allowing an adverse
possessor to remain on the land.

5 .A more controversial type of waste—and the type at issue
in _Brokaw_ —is sometimes called _ameliorative waste_. This is a type of
affirmative act

by the life tenant or lessee that significantly changes the
property, but results in an increase, rather than a diminution, in its market
value. The traditional

view, which is reflected in _Brokaw_ , is that ameliorative
waste is just another type of affirmative waste and is not permitted. Under
this understanding, the

holders of remainder interests are entitled to take
possession of the property at the end of the life tenancy or lease in
substantially the same form it had

when the life tenant or lessee first took possession.
Significant change or transformation is ruled out. An opposing view—of which
_Melms v. Pabst

Brewing Co._ , distinguished in _Brokaw_ , is the leading
example—permits ameliorative waste, at least when it can be justified by
changed circumstances.

The _Brokaw_ decision was perceived by many as being unduly
rigid, in contrast to the more flexible approach of _Melms_ , and on the
recommendation of a

Law Revision Commission the traditional rule enforced in
_Brokaw_ was repealed in New York in favor of a standard that looks to multiple
variables,

including changed circumstances in the neighborhood and
whether the modification increases the value of the property. See 1937 N.Y.
Laws 618 , 618 –

19 ; N.Y. Real Prop. Acts. Law § 803 (McKinney 2009 ). A
similar approach was endorsed by the Restatement of

```



557



```

Property, which approved of _Melms_ and disapproved of
_Brokaw_. Restatement (First) of Property § 140 cmt. f ( 1936 ). Today,
different states take a

variety of approaches to waste, and the strict approach of
_Brokaw_ appears to be followed in only a minority of American jurisdictions.
Here as elsewhere

in the common law, the law of waste has become more
flexible, and generally speaking, the greater one’s interest, the more freedom
one gets as owner.

See generally, John A. Lovett, Doctrines of Waste in a
Landscape of Waste, 72 Mo. L. Rev. 1209 ( 2007 ); Duane Rudolph, How Equity and
Custom

Transformed American Waste Law, 2 Charlotte Sch. L. Prop. J.
1 ( 2015 ). Civil law systems tend to disallow types of alteration as
ameliorative waste

rather than balancing interests or evaluating changes in
terms of efficiency. See Sally Brown Richardson, Reframing Ameliorative Waste,
65 Am. J.

Comp. L. 335 ( 2017 ). One approach consistent with the
tenor of the law of trusts and wills is to hew closely to the grantor’s intent,
making an exception

only for new beneficial uses not foreseeable at the time of
the creation of the interest. Restatement (Fourth) of Property, Vol. 1 , Div. 1
, Ch. 5 , § 5. 1 (Am.

L. Inst. Council Draft No. 3 , Sept. 29 , 2020 ).

6 .Are the various rules about waste consistent with
economic efficiency? Richard Posner has suggested that courts should apply a
simple rule of

wealth maximization: If the life tenant’s action would
maximize the present value of the property (including both the life tenant’s
interest and the

reversion or remainder interests) then it is permissible;
conversely, if the life tenant’s action would not maximize the present value of
the property, it

should be condemned as waste. See Richard A. Posner,
Economic Analysis of Law § 3. 10 , at 74 – 76 ( 9 th ed. 2014 ). But the legal
doctrine does not seem

to require maximization of present value by the party in
possession. Instead, it enforces “normal” behavior by the party in possession
and the

preservation of the status quo. Does this suggest the law is
more concerned with protecting the autonomy of property owners than with
promoting

efficiency? Is it relevant here that the law of waste is a
default rule, that is, a rule that applies only in the absence of a contrary
agreement by the affected

parties? Thus, for example, if the life tenant and the
holders of remainders in _Brokaw_ had all agreed, the mansion could be torn
down. (What if Isaac

Brokaw’s will had stated that the house could be razed in
the discretion of the life tenant?) Might concepts like “normal” behavior or
use and preserving

the status quo provide a better baseline for negotiating
contractual modifications than a norm requiring present-value maximization? But
what if

bargaining breaks down, as in _Brokaw_? Don’t the ordinary
rules of waste promote inefficient outcomes in these circumstances? For an
argument that the

strict rule of waste enforced in _Brokaw_ promotes
efficiency better than a flexible standard or a rule of wealth maximization
because it reduces the costs

of contracting between possessory and nonpossessory interest
holders, see Thomas W. Merrill, _Melms v. Pabst Brewing Co._ and the Doctrine
of Waste in

American Property Law, 94 Marquette L. Rev. 1055 ( 2011 ).
Judge Posner has a brief rebuttal in the same issue. Richard A. Posner, Comment
on Merrill

on the Law of Waste, id. at 1095.

```



7 .Should the law continue to prohibit ameliorative waste?
How much should Isaac Brokaw’s wishes govern future generations? Why should the



```

```



558



```

holders of the remainders be able to trump the wishes of the
life tenant even when the life tenant is enhancing the value of the remainder?
If the

remainder holders claim that they attach a high subjective
value on preserving the mansion, how do we know whether to believe them? Were
the holders

of the remainders in _Brokaw_ motivated by subjective
attachments to the mansion, or by other concerns? Do changed circumstances call
for judicial

intervention? If so, why didn’t the transformation of Fifth
Avenue from a boulevard of single-family residences to high-rise apartment
buildings qualify

as a changed circumstance? Compare the materials on cy pres
in Chapter VI.

Valuation of Interests

Whether legal or equitable, courts and others are sometimes
called upon to value the various interests that have been carved out of a fee

simple. For example, suppose land is divided between a life
estate and a remainder, and both tenants decide to sell the property, or the
state

decides to take the property through eminent domain. The
acquiring party will pay for the value of what it obtains—a fee simple—but then
we

have to decide how to divide the proceeds between the life
tenant and the holder of the remainder. In such cases, resort is had to
actuarial tables

and discount rates.

An example will illustrate how this is done. Suppose
Blackacre is worth $100,000 as a fee simple and (to make things less
complicated) its

value is not expected to change in the foreseeable future. A
owns a life estate, and B owns the remainder. A is 98 years old and so has a
life

expectancy of three years (at least according to the
actuarial tables used by the IRS, which does not distinguish male and female
life

expectancies). Thus, we can assume that A would get the use
of the $100,000 asset for the next three years, and B would get the use of the
asset

thereafter. One way to determine the value of the respective
interests is to ask what the remainder to B is worth today, given that B
expects to

receive Blackacre three years from now. Once we have the
value of the remainder, we can then subtract this from $100,000, in order to
determine

the value of the life estate.

How do we determine the value of the remainder, assumed to
be the equivalent of $100,000 received three years from today? If one had

$100,000 today one could invest it in a safe investment and
would wind up with more than $100,000 three years from now. What we want to
find

out is the amount today that is equivalent to what one would
have to set aside in order to have $100,000 three years from now. To find this
out,

one would normally use spreadsheet software, but it is
important to understand what calculations are actually going on. First we need
a discount

rate, reflecting the time value of money.^3 Assume this is 7

#559

percent. To have $1 one year from now, the amount P one has
to set aside now is roughly 93 cents. P × (1 + .07) = $1.00 or P = $1.00 /
(1.07) =

$.93. That is, to find the present discounted value of a
dollar amount one year from now, divide the future amount ($1.00) by the sum of
one and

the discount rate (here 1.07). One dollar two years from now
is like one dollar one year from now, deferred an additional year. It is worth
87

cents now because P × (1 + .07) × (1 + .07) = $1.00, or P =
$1. 00 / ((1.07) × (1.07)) = $.87. A dollar deferred three years is worth $.82
= $1.00 /

(1.07)^3 , or 81.63 cents. Thus, the remainder that will be
worth $100,000 three years from now is worth approximately $81,630 today
($100,000 /

(1.07)^3 ). This can be generalized.^4

What then is the life estate worth? The property itself is
worth $100,000 now and the remainder is worth $81,630 now, leaving $18,370

($100,000 $81,630) for the life estate.

Another way to reach the same result is to determine what
the life estate should be worth in terms of a stream of payments that $100,000

can earn over the three year period. Taking 7 percent to be
the rate of return, the $100,000 investment will yield $7,000 each year. The
$7,000

earned at the end of the first year is worth $6, 542 today
(= $7,000 / (1.07)). (This can be thought of as 7,000 times the $.93 present
value of each

dollar a year from now). Similarly, year two’s payment is
$6,1 14 (= $7,000 / (1.07)^2 ), and year three’s payment is $5,714 (= $7,000 /
(1.07)^3 ).

The three payments add to $18,370. If we calculate the value
of the life estate this way, we can then subtract this from $100,000 to
determine the

value of the remainder ($81,630 as before).

The discount factor is crucial here. One interesting feature
of the 7% discount rate is that an amount doubles roughly every 10 years at a
7%

rate. For comparison, if the discount rate is 4 %, the
(expected three-year) life estate would be worth $11,100 and the remainder
$88,900. But if

the discount rate is 10%, then the life estate and remainder
are worth $24,869 and $75,131, respectively, in present discounted value terms.
The

higher the discount rate, the less a future dollar is worth
now (and the more valuable the life estate is because it is weighted more
towards the

present). And at any given discount rate, the further off in
the future a dollar is, the less it is worth now. What (if any) discount rate
should be

applied to benefits obtained in the future from
environmental regulation (especially future lives saved) has been the focal
point of much

controversy in environmental law. See, e.g., Richard L.
Revesz, Environmental Regulation, Cost-Benefit Analysis, and the Discounting of

Human Lives, 99 Colum. L. Rev. 941 (1999); Arden Rowell,

#560

Quantitative Valuation in Environmental Law, 96 Notre Dame
L. Rev. 1539 (2021).

The present values of a life estate and the corresponding
remainder also depend on the life expectancy of the life tenant. In our example
this

was assumed to be three years. Life estates, remainders, and
other interests have to be valued for income tax purposes, and the methods
there can

be taken as illustrative. See I.R.C. § 7520. Using a 7%
interest rate, if the life tenant of the $100,000 property is 10 years old, the
remainder

would have present discounted value of $2,595. If the life
tenant is 35, then the remainder is worth $9,155 now. And if the life tenant is
55, 70, or

90, the remainder would be valued at $24,604, $44,456, and
$75,748, respectively. Of course, life expectancies are based only on averages
over

large groups of people. Psychologists have documented that
most non-depressed people tend to be optimistic about their own abilities and

prospects. (Depressed people are simply realistic in these
matters.) Might this affect the negotiation between the holders of the life
estate and the

remainder?

### 2 .RESTRAINTS ON ALIENATION

One of the normal incidents of owner sovereignty is the
ability to alienate or transfer property to another. Consequently, courts have
long

taken a dim view of attempts to restrain the power of an
owner to alienate. Almost any attempt directly to restrain alienation will be
held void as

contrary to public policy. For example, if O grants
Blackacre, which is otherwise generally alienable, “to A in fee simple, on the
understanding

that A has no power to alienate,” the restraint on
alienation will be struck down and the conveyance will be interpreted as if it
said “to A in fee

simple.” It did not take courts long similarly to conclude
that efforts to use defeasible fees or executory limitations to effectuate
complete

restraints on alienation are similarly void. For example, if
O grants Blackacre “to A in fee simple so long as A does not alienate, then to
O,” this

too will be struck down as an attempt to restrain
alienation.

But what about other conditions which have the effect of
severely reducing the possibilities of alienation? Suppose alienation is
prohibited

only to certain categories of transferees? Courts will
typically uphold restraints on alienation for a limited period of time if they
appear to be

reasonably related to some family estate planning objective.
Examples would include a restraint on alienation by a minor until he or she
reaches

the age of majority, or a restraint on a life estate given
to a surviving spouse when the property in question (e.g., the family home or
farm) is

intended ultimately to pass to someone else like surviving
children.

#### Mountain Brow Lodge No. 82, Independent Order of Odd

Fellows v. Toscano

```



Court of Appeal, Fifth District, California, 1967.



257 Cal.App. 2 d 22 , 64 Cal.Rptr. 816.



```

■
GARGANO, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE. This action was instituted by appellant, a
non-profit corporation, to quiet its title to a parcel of real property

which it acquired on April 6, 1950, by gift deed from James
V. Toscano and Maria Toscano, both deceased. Respondents are the trustees and

administrators of the estates of the deceased grantors and
appellant sought to quiet its title as to their interest in the land arising
from certain

conditions contained in the gift deed.

The matter was submitted to the court on stipulated facts
and the court rendered judgment in favor of respondents. * * *

The controversy between the parties centers on the language
contained in the habendum clause of the deed of conveyance which reads as

follows: “Said property is restricted for the use and
benefit of the second party, only; and in the event the same fails to be used
by the second

party or in the event of sale or transfer by the second
party of all or any part of said lot, the same is to revert to the first
parties herein, their

successors, heirs or assigns.” Respondents maintain that the
language creates a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent and is valid
and

enforceable. On the other hand, appellant contends that the
restrictive language amounts to an absolute restraint on its power of
alienation and is

void. It apparently asserts that, since the purpose for
which the land must be used is not precisely defined, it may be used by
appellant for any

purpose and hence the restriction is not on the land use but
on who uses it. Thus, appellant concludes that it is clear that the
reversionary clause

was intended by grantors to take effect only if appellant
sells or transfers the land.

Admittedly, the condition of the habendum clause which
prohibits appellant from selling or transferring the land under penalty of
forfeiture

is an absolute restraint against alienation and is void. The
common law rule prohibiting restraint against alienation is embodied in Civil
Code

section 711 which provides: “Conditions restraining
alienation, when repugnant to the interest created, are void.” However, this
condition and the

condition relating to the use of the land are in the
disjunctive and are clearly severable. In other words, under the plain language
of the deed the

grantors, their successors or assigns may exercise their
power of termination “if the land is not used by the second party” or “in the
event of sale

or transfer by second party.” Thus, the invalid restraint
against alienation does not necessarily affect or nullify the condition on land
use (Los

Angeles Investment Company v. Gary, 186 P. 596 (Cal. 1919)).

The remaining question, therefore, is whether the use
condition created a defeasible fee as respondents maintain or whether it is
also a

restraint against alienation and nothing more as appellant
alleges.

#562

Significantly, appellant is a non-profit corporation
organized for lodge, fraternal and similar purposes. Moreover, decedent, James
V. Toscano,

was an active member of the lodge at the time of his death.
In addition, the term “use” as applied to real property can be construed to
mean a

“right which a person has to use or enjoy the property of
another according to his necessities” (Mulford v. LeFranc, 26 Cal. 88, 102
(1864)).

Under these circumstances it is reasonably clear that when
the grantors stated that the land was conveyed in consideration of “love and
affection”

and added that it “is restricted for the use and benefit of
the second party” they simply meant to say that the land was conveyed upon
condition

that it would be used for lodge, fraternal and other
purposes for which the nonprofit corporation was formed. Thus, we conclude that
the portion

of the habendum clause relating to the land use, when
construed as a whole and in light of the surrounding circumstances, created a
fee subject to

a condition subsequent with title to revert to the grantors,
their successors or assigns if the land ceases to be used for lodge, fraternal
and similar

purposes for which the appellant is formed.^2 No formal
language is necessary to create a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent
as long as

the intent of the grantor is clear. It is the rule that the
object in construing a deed is to ascertain the intention of the grantor from
words which

have been employed and from surrounding circumstances.

It is of course arguable, as appellant suggests, that the
condition in appellant’s deed is not a restriction on land use but on who uses
it. Be

this as it may, the distinction between a covenant which
restrains the alienation of a fee simple absolute and a condition which
restricts land use

and creates a defeasible estate was long recognized at
common law and is recognized in this state. Thus, conditions restricting land
use have been

upheld by the California courts on numerous occasions even
though they hamper, and often completely impede, alienation. A few examples

follow: Mitchell v. Cheney Slough Irrigation Co., 134 P.2d
34 (Cal. Ct. App. 1943) (irrigation ditch); Aller v. Berkeley Hall School
Foundation,

103 P.2d 1052 (Cal. Ct. App. 1940) (exclusively private
dwellings); Rosecrans v. Pacific Electric Railway Co., 134 P.2d 245 (Cal. 1943)
(to

maintain a train schedule); Schultz v. Beers, 245 P.2d 334
(Cal. Ct. App. 1952) (road purposes); Firth v. Marovich, 116 P. 729 (Cal. 191
1)

(residence only).

Moreover, if appellant’s suggestion is carried to its
logical conclusion it would mean that real property could not be conveyed to a
city to be

used only for its own city purposes, or to a school district
to be used only for its own school purposes, or to a church to be used only for
its own

church purposes. Such restrictions would also be
restrictions upon who uses the land. And yet we do not understand this to be
the rule of this

state. For example, in Los Angeles Investment Company v.
Gary , supra,

#563

land had been conveyed upon condition that it was not to be
sold, leased, rented or occupied by persons other than those of Caucasian race.
The

court held that the condition against alienation of the land
was void, but upheld the condition restricting the land use. Although a use
restriction

compelling racial discrimination is no longer consonant with
constitutional principles under more recent decisions, the sharp distinction
that the

court drew between a restriction on land use and a
restriction on alienation is still valid. For further example, in the leading
and often cited case

of Johnston v. City of Los Angeles, 168 P. 1047 (Cal. 1917),
the land was conveyed to the City of Los Angeles on the express condition that
the

city would use it for the erection and maintenance of a dam,
the land to revert if the city ceased to use it for such purposes. The Supreme
Court

held that the condition created a defeasible estate,
apparently even though it was by necessity a restriction on who could use the
land.

Our independent research indicates that the rule is the same
in other jurisdictions. In Regular Predestinarian Baptist Church of Pleasant

Grove v. Parker, 27 N.E.2d 522 (Ill. 1940), a condition “
‘To have and to hold * * * as long as the same is used by the Regular
Predestinarian

Baptist Church as a place of meeting * * * ’ ” was deemed to
have created a defeasible estate by the Supreme Court of Illinois. * * *

For the reasons herein stated, the first paragraph of the
judgment below is amended and revised to read:

1.That at the time of the commencement of this action title
to the parcel of real property situated in the City of Los Banos, County of

Merced, State of California, being described as:

Lot 20 Block 72 according to the Map of the Town of Los
Banos was vested in the MOUNTAIN BROW LODGE NO. 82,

INDEPENDENT ORDER OF ODD FELLOWS, subject to the condition
that said property is restricted for the use and benefit of the

second party only; and in the event the same fails to be
used by the second party the same is to revert to the first parties herein,
their

successors, heirs or assigns.

As so modified the judgment is affirmed. Respondents to
recover their costs on appeal.

■ STONE,
ASSOCIATE JUSTICE. I dissent. I believe the entire habendum clause which
purports to restrict the fee simple conveyed is invalid as a

restraint upon alienation within the ambit of Civil Code
section 71 1. It reads: “Said property is restricted for the use and benefit of
the second

party, only; and in the event the same fails to be used by
the second party or in the event of sale or transfer by the second party of all
or any part

of said lot the same is to revert to the first parties
herein, their successors, heirs or assigns.”

If the words “sale or transfer,” which the majority find to
be a restraint upon alienation, are expunged, still the property cannot be sold

#564

or transferred by the grantee because the property may be
used by only the I.O.O.F. Lodge No. 82, upon pain of reverter. This use
restriction

prevents the grantee from conveying the property just as
effectively as the condition against “sale or transfer * * * of all or any part
of said lot.”

Certainly, if we are to have realism in the law, the effect
of language must be judged according to what it does. When two different terms

generate the same ultimate legal result, they should be
treated alike in relation to that result.

Section 711 of the Civil Code expresses an ancient policy of
English common law. * The wisdom of this proscription as applied to situations

of this kind is manifest when we note that a number of
fraternal, political and similar organizations of a century ago have
disappeared, and others

have ceased to function in individual communities. Should an
organization holding property under a deed similar to the one before us be

disbanded one hundred years or so after the conveyance is
made, the result may well be a title fragmented into the interests of heirs of
the

grantors numbering in the hundreds and scattered to the four
corners of the earth. * * *

In any event, it seems to me that quite aside from section
782, the entire habendum clause is repugnant to the grant in fee simple that

precedes it. I would hold the property free from
restrictions, and reverse the judgment.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Generally in cases in which an instrument’s language is
ambiguous as to whether it creates a fee simple determinable or a fee simple
subject to

condition subsequent, courts tend to favor the latter
because it will avoid automatic forfeiture. Does this construction also do more
to promote free

```



565



```

alienation of property? The future interest following both
these types of interests can be extinguished if the condition is violated and
the grantor (or his

successor) fails to reclaim the property within the time
established by the statute of limitations. If the interest is a possibility of
reverter, and the grantor

fails to sue to recover possession in an action in trespass
or ejectment before the statute of limitations runs, then the owner of the fee
simple

determinable gets a fee simple absolute by adverse
possession. If the interest is a right of entry, and the grantor fails to
assert his right to re-enter within

a reasonable period of time, then the owner of the fee
simple subject to condition subsequent will be able to obtain an equitable
judgment that re-entry is

barred by the doctrine of laches, in effect creating a fee
simple absolute. In determining what is a reasonable period of time for
purposes of laches, courts

generally look to the statute of limitations for adverse
possession. So there is not a lot of room for distinguishing between the two
types of defeasible

fees on this ground. Is there some other ground for
preferring the fee simple subject to condition subsequent construction on
grounds of free alienation?

2 .How far do you suppose the majority would be willing to
extend its formal rule that restrictions on use do not violate the prohibition
against

restraints on alienation? Suppose only one member of the Odd
Fellows Lodge, Local No. 82 is still alive, and he is on a respirator in a
nursing home. Or,

suppose all members of the Lodge have died, and the building
stands vacant. Is the restriction still enforceable? How far do you suppose the
dissent

would be willing to extend its realistic test that would
invalidate restrictions on use that have the practical effect of impairing
alienation? Suppose it

could be shown that any defeasible fee that restricts use to
some specific charitable or nonprofit activity will severely impair the market
value of the

property. Would this be enough to justify a judgment
invalidating the condition? Courts generally give greater leeway to restraints
on use in gifts for

charitable purposes. See Canova Land & Inv. Co. v. Lynn,
856 S.E. 2 d 581 (Va. 2021 ); Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes) § 3.
4 cmt. c (Am. L.

Inst. 2000 ) (“If land is held for conservation, historic
preservation, or charitable purposes, very severe restraints on alienation are
normally justified to

assure that the land continues to be used for the intended
purposes.”).

3 .What exactly does it mean for property to be restricted
to “the use and benefit” of some entity? Suppose there are only three elderly
Odd

Fellows still alive; they vote unanimously at a formal
meeting of the Lodge to sell the building to a real estate developer and to use
the proceeds for one

final fling in Las Vegas. Is this for the “use and benefit”
of the Lodge? Does your answer change if the proceeds are to be used to
purchase adjacent

rooms in a nursing home, where the three can continue to
meet? If these sorts of transactions are permissible, does this significantly
alleviate concerns

about use restrictions impairing marketability?

4 .What are the reasons for the very strong policy against
restraints on alienation? Courts often say that restraints on alienation are
“repugnant to

the fee,” but this just begs the question as to why fee
simple ownership (or absolute ownership of personal property) should nearly
always include the

```



566



```

power of alienation. Traditional justifications emphasize
owner autonomy. Thus, just as owners are generally free to abandon or destroy
their property

when it no longer suits their needs, see Chapter IV, so it
is thought they should be free to dispose of property by sale or gift. Like the
powers to abandon

or destroy, the power to alienate prevents us from becoming
slaves to our property. The principal difference among these powers is that the
power to

alienate allows the owner to appoint the new owner of the
asset—something the owner cannot do if the property is destroyed or
abandoned—and this

likely makes owners even more willing to part with
burdensome ownership obligations. The right to transfer also has powerful
efficiency justifications.

Free alienability permits things to be reallocated from one
person to another so as to allow those who place a higher value on the asset to
end up in

control of it. If the process of transfer were costless
(recall the Coase theorem, Chapter I), all things would end up in the hands of
the persons who value

them the most. In this happy state of affairs, society would
be better off, in terms of the satisfaction of all persons’ wants and needs,
than it would be

under any other allocation of things. Although this state of
nirvana is unachievable in practice given positive transaction costs, it is
quite likely that

society will come closer to achieving such a state if assets
are freely transferable, than it will if there are significant restrictions on
the transfer of assets.

Finally, we can think of free alienation as the primary way
in which society changes assignments of responsibility for the management of
resources.

When one owner-gatekeeper gets tired of performing the role
of manager of any asset, he or she can transfer managerial responsibility to
someone else

who is more eager to take on this role. This method of
changing managers taps into local knowledge and probably generates less
friction than other

methods, such as adverse possession, eminent domain, or
having the state decide who gets to be the manager.

5 .All that being said, there are contexts in which free
alienation is regarded with suspicion. We have seen in Chapter III that some
kinds of things

—human beings, body parts, and cultural patrimony—are often
regarded as being outside the sphere of interests that can be held as property.
What this

often means—especially in the context of body parts and
genetic material or cultural patrimony—is not that we think persons in
possession of such

things should have no right to exclude. What it means is
that we are uncomfortable allowing such things to be freely transferred from
one person to

another, especially by sale. Thus, one intermediate solution
mentioned in those materials is to afford certain things—like body parts—some
of the

attributes of property such as the right to exclude while
denying these things the feature of full transferability. In other words,
sometimes the law

_requires_ restraints on alienation, rather than prohibiting
them.

### 3 .THE RULE AGAINST PERPETUITIES

The Rule against Perpetuities (RAP) is a crystallization of
older doctrines invalidating interests that gave too much remote control to the

“dead hand.” Notwithstanding its name, the RAP does not
prohibit “perpetual” or even very long-lasting interests. After all, the fee
simple is an

interest of potentially infinite duration, but it is the
antithesis of the

#567

kind of interests targeted by the RAP. Leases can be very
long too—sometimes 99 or even 999 years long—and in some jurisdictions it is

possible to create a perpetual lease. Yet these very long
leases are also unproblematic under the RAP. Instead, the RAP prohibits the
creation of

contingent interests that are not certain to vest within a
prescribed time period.

Why did courts come to disapprove of contingent rights that
might vest too remotely in the future? One reason is that long-lasting

contingencies about title can impair alienation. Few people
will want to buy property with unresolved contingencies about ownership hanging

over it. Another reason relates to concerns about giving the
dead too much control over the ownership and use of resources by the living.
The

RAP basically allows testators to keep ownership contingent
for one generation into the future plus the next generation up to the
traditional age

of majority. The judges who devised the rule thought that
these are the only people that a testator can really have any knowledge of or

benevolence towards. (Others might disagree.) Beyond that,
testators should not be allowed to control the disposition of property.
Finally, the

RAP is sometimes associated with the objective of breaking
up large, potentially overly aristocratic estates. We have seen that in earlier
times

elite families often regarded keeping property, especially
landed property, within the family to be an overriding consideration, and
creating

various contingent interests that last far into the future
(e.g., to account for unborn grandchildren) is one way to do this. The RAP
creates a

barrier to these kinds of dynastic impulses.

Although informed by these policies, the RAP has evolved
into a very formalistic rule, in the sense that it can be applied without
direct

reference to these policies, or much other contextual
information, for that matter. The rule received its canonical (if currently
rare) form from

Professor John Chipman Gray:

No interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not
later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the creation of the
interest.

John Chipman Gray, Rule Against Perpetuities § 201 (Roland
Gray ed., 4th ed. 1942). Gray sought in this formulation the brightest of
bright-line

rules that would receive “remorseless” application. Id. §
629. What the rule does is define a time period (lives in being plus 21 years)
and ask

whether within this time period we will know whether or not
certain types of questions will be resolved. These questions have to do with

uncertainty about vesting in interest, not necessarily
vesting in possession. That is, we will be asking whether within the
“perpetuities period”

contingencies about the identity of the takers and other
named events will be removed. Moreover, the RAP is a rule against interests
vesting (in

interest) too remotely, and more precisely against interests
possibly vesting too remotely, not a rule against interests lasting too long.
Consider

this example:

#568

To Marge for life, then to Bart and his heirs.

The remainder here might last forever (and could remain with
Bart forever if he turned out to be immortal), but this would be fine.

Vesting means the elimination of the “suspense” element.
This can be of one or more of three types:

(i)For a contingent remainder, removing suspense means the
ascertainment of the identity of the taker and the satisfaction of all

conditions precedent:

Homer grants Blackacre “to Marge for life and to my first
child who shall pass the bar, upon his or her marriage.”

Here there is uncertainty as to who Homer’s first child to
pass the bar will be and whether and when he or she will marry.

(ii)For an executory interest eliminating the relevant
uncertainty means the taking of possession (the cutting short of the prior

interest actually happens);^5

Marge grants Blackacre “to Bart as long as no alcohol is
ever consumed on the premises during his lifetime, then to Lisa.”

Here the uncertainty over whether the condition will occur
will not be resolved until Bart dies or consumes alcohol on Blackacre
(whichever

comes first).

(iii)For a remainder subject to open (as in a class gift),
it means the closing of the class:

Abe grants Blackacre “to my children who shall reach the age
of 21.”

Lack of vesting can happen because the identity of a taker
is not determined (for example, heirs are not determined yet) or there is a
contingency

that has not happened yet. Here we have both.

To summarize: Those future interests potentially subject to
the RAP are contingent remainders, executory interests, and vested remainders

subject to partial divestment (i.e., subject to open). All
other future interests, including those retained by the grantor (reversions,
possibilities of

reverter, and rights of entry) and other types of vested
remainders are not subject to the RAP. Vested remainders subject to complete
divestment

are not themselves subject to the RAP, although if the
interests that divest these vested remainders are executory interests, they of
course are

subject to the RAP. See Figure 5-5 supra.

Note that for the RAP the measuring lives must exist at the
time of the creation of the interest, and then comes the 21-year period (the
21-

year period cannot come first). Why 21 years? The idea is
that a testator or other grantor can legitimately care about and act
paternalistically

#569

toward the next generation plus the next generation after
that up to the age at which people become responsible, which courts assumed to
be 21.

The RAP is tricky because some very similar sounding
interests may fall on opposite sides of the line. Consider some more examples
of a

generic bequest of personal property:

Example 1 : T makes a bequest “to my grandchildren who shall
reach the age of 21.”

This is valid because all T’s grandchildren must be born
within the lives of T’s children and these lives must be lives in being at T’s
death. This

illustrates a couple of important points. First, a child who
is born after T’s death is deemed to be in being at conception if the child is
later born

alive. If the child was later born alive, the common law
would add the period of gestation to the perpetuities period. See Thellusson v.
Woodford,

(1805) 32 Eng. Rep. 1030 (Ch.); W. Barton Leach,
Perpetuities in a Nutshell, 51 Harv. L. Rev. 63 8, 642 (1938). Second, the
measuring lives do

not have to be those of people mentioned in the instrument,
need not be holders of previous estates, and need have no special connection to
the

property. They just need to be people who can affect the
vesting (through the condition stated in the instrument or through the identity
of the

takers).

Example 2 : T sets up an inter vivos trust for “my
grandchildren who shall reach the age of 21.”

This is invalid. It could happen that all the existing
children of T may die, and T has more children, one of whom has a grandchild
who reaches

21 after the perpetuities period. In this case, no measuring
lives can be found that span from the creation of the interest to 21 years
before its

vesting. Note that this illustrates the importance of
considering the perpetuities issue from the standpoint of the time of the
creation of the

interest. This makes all the difference between this example
and Example 1, where the interest comes into being when the testator dies, thus

preventing the remote vesting scenario with the afterborn
child.

Example 3 : T makes a bequest “to A’s grandchildren who
shall reach the age of 21.” A is alive at the time of the testator’s death.

This is invalid for reasons similar to those in Example 2.
Because A can have more children, the children’s lives cannot be taken as
measuring

lives. So the problem is not bequest versus inter vivos
transfer but whether there can be more children or not. If so, they cannot be
the measuring

lives. One might ask what would happen if a bequest is made
“to my children for their lives, remainder to my grandchildren who shall reach
21.”

Again, this is all right even if the testator has a child
born several months after his death, because of the extension granted for
gestation time.

The RAP has given rise to an enduring sport: Attempting to
maximize the perpetuities period by using a larger and younger set of

measuring lives. Courts will invalidate such interests when
the burden

#570

of keeping track of the measuring lives is too great. A
time-honored technique is to create an interest that will vest 21 years after
the death of the

last of a list of a dozen or so healthy babies. Over the
line are attempts to similarly use the list of everyone in the New York City
phone directory

(“to my descendants who shall be living 21 years after the
death of everyone listed in the New York City phone book”). See also In re
Moore,

[1901] 1 Ch. 936, 938 (invalidating as void for uncertainty
a gift in trust to endure until “twenty-one years from the death of the last
survivor of

all persons who shall be living at my death,” and noting
that “[i]t is impossible to ascertain when the last life will be
extinguished.... Under

these circumstances it is not, I think, necessary for me to
consider whether the gift is void as transgressing the rule against
perpetuity.”) To take

the most creative and successful example, in In re Villar ,
[1929] 1 Ch. 243 (C.A.) the court held that the RAP did not invalidate bequests
in trust

that were to vest “at the expiration of 20 years from the
day of the death of the last survivor of all the lineal descendants of Her Late
Majesty

Queen Victoria who shall be living at the time of my death.”
[1929] 1 Ch. at 243. At the time of the testator’s death in 1926 there were 120
or so

such descendants then living. Although it has been suggested
that an American court would not uphold such an interest (nor the one employing

the city phone book formula), Restatement of Property § 374
cmt. l (1944), why are “royal lives” clauses more likely to be upheld in
England

than the city phone book approach?

Recall in this connection that future interests retained by
the grantor are treated as vested on creation and so satisfy the RAP. Are such

interests easier to keep track of than interests created in
third parties?

As can be seen in the above examples, the RAP traditionally
involved spinning out scenarios of what might happen based solely on

information available at the time the interest was created.
The common law pursued this approach relentlessly, and presumed that anyone, no

matter how old, could marry or have children at any time,
leading to invalidation on the possibility of “unborn widows” and “fertile

octogenarians.”

In the unborn widow scenario, a gift is made to A for life
and then to A’s widow for life, then to A’s children then living. This seems
fine at

first blush, until one spins a story in which A’s present
wife dies or she and A divorce and A then marries a woman who was born after
the

creation of the interest. If so the interest in her children
could vest outside the perpetuities period. As for the fertile octogenarian,
suppose O

conveys “to my wife A for life, then to my grandchildren who
reach age 21.” O and A, both age 80, have a child B, age 45, and B has a child
C,

age 10. Again this seems fine on cursory examination. But
suppose, after the conveyance, that the octogenarian A has another child, D,
who then

produces a grandchild, E. There is no life in being at the
time of the conveyance that can demonstrate, as a matter of what-might-happen

#571

logic, that the interest of E will vest or not within the
perpetuities period. See Jee v. Audley, 1 Cox 324, 29 Eng. Rep. 1186 (Ch.
1787).

Not surprisingly, such results and the rule that produced
them came in for heavy criticism, leading to limited reforms such as a
presumption

that the fertile octogenarian and unborn widow situations
will not arise. Shortly we will take up more sweeping reforms, such as
wait-and-see,

which would also have saved these sorts of situations from
invalidation.

More recently, assisted reproductive techniques have made
postmenopausal births possible. More generally, techniques such as

cryopreservation of sperm, eggs, and embryos present new
challenges for the RAP, where it still exists. Such techniques are sometimes
said not

to count for the common-law RAP. Can you see the problems
posed? For a review of how various reforms do and do not address the challenges

to the RAP and inheritance law raised by new reproductive
technologies, see Sharona Hoffman & Andrew P. Morriss, Birth After Death:

Perpetuities and the New Reproductive Technologies, 38 Ga.
L. Rev. 575 (2004).

If you feel uneasy about applying the RAP, you are in good
company. The RAP has long been notorious as a trap for the unwary. The

California Supreme Court once went so far as to hold it not
to be malpractice for a lawyer to miss a subtle perpetuities problem in
drafting a will.

Lucas v. Hamm, 364 P.2d 685 (Cal. 1961). The Court quoted
Professor Gray, the author of the famous formulation of the rule as saying: “
‘There

is something in the subject which seems to facilitate error.
Perhaps it is because the mode of reasoning is unlike that with which lawyers
are most

familiar. * * * A long list might be formed of the
demonstrable blunders with regard to its questions made by eminent men,
blunders which they

themselves have been sometimes the first to acknowledge; and
there are few lawyers of any practice in drawing wills and settlements who have

not at some time either fallen into the net which the Rule
spreads for the unwary, or at least shuddered to think how narrowly they have
escaped

it.’ Gray, The Rule Against Perpetuities (4th ed. 1942) p.
xi.” Id. at 690.

A standard solution to the perpetuities problem is to insert
a “perpetuities savings clause” into the relevant instrument. Such a clause
refers

explicitly to the possibility of invalidation under the RAP
and specifies a backup plan. Consider the key part of one version of a savings
clause:

If any interest purported to be created in this instrument
or in any instrument exercising a power created in this instrument is

challenged under the Rule Against Perpetuities or any
related rule, I direct the corporate donee (hereafter designated) to appoint
the

assets which the challenged interest purports to dispose of
in such manner as will most closely approximate, within clearly permissible

limits, the intention of the person who has executed the
instrument purporting to create such interest.

#572

W. Barton Leach & James K. Logan, Perpetuities: A
Standard Saving Clause to Avoid Violations of the Rule, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 1 141,
1 141–42

(1961). Courts have upheld perpetuities savings clauses.
See, e.g., Norton v. Georgia R.R. Bank & Trust, 322 S.E.2d 870 (Ga. 1984).
The savings

clause became a standard practice and made perpetuities
problems relatively easy to avoid even before the judicial and statutory
reforms

discussed below.

Finally, courts have recently started using reinterpretation
to save interests from invalidation under the RAP. The method here is in effect
to

rewrite the instrument so that it conforms with the
grantor’s intent as closely as possible, but becomes consistent with the RAP.
(Courts have had

some experience in the doctrine of cy pres, which saves
gifts to charity from impossibility, or more recently wastefulness, by
substituting another

close charity. See Chapter VI.) Even under older RAP
doctrine, charities received somewhat favorable treatment. Consider the
following

example:

Example 4 : O grants Blackacre “to Springfield Law School so
long as it is used for instruction in the law, but if it is not used for

instruction in the law, then to Shelbyville Law School.”

The Springfield Law School has a fee simple subject to
executory limitation, and the Shelbyville Law School has an executory interest.
The

executory interest would normally violate the RAP because it
is not guaranteed to vest within lives in being plus 21 years. Nevertheless,
the

executory interest would probably be all right under the
rule of two charities: An interest does not violate the RAP if the interest
involves a

transfer from one charity to another, as here.

PROBLEMS

In the following, identify the interests O is trying to
create, and if different, the interests actually created or resulting from the
facts given. Assume

that the common-law version of the Rule against Perpetuities
is in force.

1 .O grants Blackacre “to Huxley College, as long as it is
used for instructional purposes; then to my son A and his heirs.”

2 .O grants Blackacre “to A; but if marijuana is inhaled on
the premises, then O has the right to reenter and take the premises.”

3 .O grants Blackacre “to A; but if marijuana is inhaled on
the premises, then to B and her heirs.”

4 .O grants Blackacre “to A for life, then to B’s
grandchildren who reach the age of 21 .” Assume that B is dead at the time the
interest is created,

leaving children but no grandchildren.

5 .O grants Blackacre “to A for life, then to my
grandchildren who graduate from high school.” O has children B and C, but no
grandchildren at

the time of the grant.

#573

6 .As in Problem 5 , except the transfer is by devise (a
grant of real estate in a will).

Reforms

A growing number of states have significantly reformed or
abolished the common-law RAP, or allow parties to opt out of the rule in

drafting a will or trust if they chose to do so. Much of the
motivation for relaxing the constraints of the RAP comes from the federal tax

advantages to dynasty trusts, and there now seems to be a
jurisdictional competition to attract trust business by allowing trust settlors
to skirt

around the RAP (at least among states that do not tax income
from trust funds). Max Schanzenbach & Robert Sitkoff, Jurisdictional
Competition

for Trust Funds: An Empirical Analysis of Perpetuities and
Taxes, 115 Yale L.J. 356 (2005). In addition to tax considerations, some
testators still

want to exercise control over the future. Trust specialists
seem to be advertising on that basis. Joshua C. Tate, Perpetual Trusts and the
Settlor’s

Intent, 53 Kan. L. Rev. 595 (2005). Other reforms:

(i) Wait and See for the Common-Law RAP Period (or some
related period). Under this approach one would, if necessary, wait and see

whether the interest vests remotely or not. Thus in Examples
2 and 3 (and in some of the Problems) above, one would wait and see whether

additional children were born. If not, the interest would
turn out to be valid. But notice that one would typically not know this for
quite a while.

(ii) Wait and See for the Common-Law Period or 90 Years.
This is like wait and see but allows for a 90-year alternative period. Like
(i), this

approach allows interests to satisfy the RAP the common-law
way—ex ante, at the time the interest is created—as well. So if the interest
satisfies

the common-law RAP one can know it is valid right away.
Also, one knows that one won’t have to wait more than 90 years to find out
either.

Some commentators have heavily criticized the 90-year period
on the grounds that interests that are only valid because of the 90-year
wait-and-

see period involve a high degree of uncertainty for this
lengthy period of time. Keeping the RAP but adopting wait-and-see in general
involves

tolerating uncertainty.

(iii) Interpretation and Implication. Sometimes drafters and
courts will insert a perpetuities savings clause or otherwise reform an
interest

(as by changing 25 years to 21 years). Courts will sometimes
also refuse to invalidate a class gift if it fails to vest for the entire class
within the

perpetuities period. Thus in a gift to “A’s children” the
interest is held to vest even if a child might be born too remotely; the
interest simply fails

with respect to that child only, rejecting the
all-or-nothing approach of the common-law RAP. See, e.g., In re Estate of
Anderson, 541 So.2d 423

(Miss. 1989).

The Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (USRAP)
combines approaches (ii) and (iii). Among other things, the USRAP

#574

provides for a cy pres-like approach to saving ill-drafted
instruments, under which an interested person can petition a court to “reform a

disposition in the manner that most closely approximates the
transferor’s manifested plan of distribution and is within the 90 years
allowed” as

long as one of a number of conditions holds.

Close to half the states have adopted the USRAP, about a
quarter of the states permit trust settlors to opt out of the RAP if they
choose, eight

states have abolished the RAP outright, and several other
states allow courts to reform instruments so as to make them comply with the
Rule.

Helene Shapo et al., Bogert’s Trusts and Trustees § 214, at
n.28 (2015); see also Jesse Dukeminier & James E. Krier, The Rise of the
Perpetual

Trust, 50 UCLA L. Rev. 1303 (2003).

The Problem of Dead Hand Control

The intuition that there is something wrong with dead hand
control is a longstanding and fairly robust one. For example, Adam Smith

warned that “[t]o give a man power over his property after
his death is very considerable, but it is nothing [compared] to an extension of
this

power to the end of the world.” Adam Smith, Lectures on
Jurisprudence 467 (R.L. Meek et al. eds., 1978) (ms. 1762–66). As in the case
of rules

against restraints on alienation, we can ask why we need
mandatory rules against dead hand control.

What would testators do if given unlimited discretion? Many
testators would like to give freedom to the recipient—often the testator’s

spouse or children—and here the issue does not arise. But
sometimes testators will worry about unwise decisions by the donee, or the
testator

would like to condition or control the resources into the
future. As we saw in Chapter IV, the law gives wide but not unlimited latitude
to owners

to destroy property, and at first glance controlling
property into the future is a less sweeping use of the property. As in the
right to destroy,

subjecting property to post mortem control is costly to the
donee in that she cannot sell it (for a price that would reflect future use) or
give it

away in some other way. If the present discounted future
benefits and liabilities of the property are reflected in current prices (known
as

“capitalization”), wouldn’t the donor take these values into
account? What, if anything does capitalization leave out of the picture?

Some have sought to justify the RAP on the ground that dead
people cannot experience utility, but even if so, people who are living may

derive utility in anticipating such control and might even
work harder to create wealth that they can subject to such control. Conversely,
some

focus on the needs of the members of the future generation
who have to live with the dead hand conditions is appropriate. What do we owe
future

generations? Does the RAP serve these interests?

Others have argued that the future is full of uncertainty
and a testator cannot be expected to foresee all the contingencies relevant to

#575

the testator’s overall plan. We will take up such problems
with the cy pres doctrine in Chapter VI. Property rights typically last a long
time. Does

dead hand control put too much of a burden on future owners
and judges to figure out what the creator of the interest wanted? Why don’t we

have a menu of options for flexibility that the creator of
the interest can choose from, ranging from wooden application of the testator’s
language

to letting judges intervene according to their assessment of
future needs? If future people reach a consensus that some type of dead hand
control

is harmful, what is to stop them from simply doing as they
wish? For discussion of these issues, see, e.g., Steven Shavell, Foundations of
the

```



Court of Appeals of New York, 1996.



669 N.E. 2 d 799.



```

■ KAYE,
CHIEF JUDGE. This case presents the novel question whether options to purchase
commercial property are exempt from the prohibition

against remote vesting embodied in New York’s Rule against
Perpetuities (EPTL 9–1.1[b]). Because an exception for commercial options finds

no support in our law, we decline to exempt all commercial
option agreements from the statutory Rule against Perpetuities.

Here, we agree with the trial court and Appellate Division
that the option defendants seek to enforce violates the statutory prohibition

against remote vesting and is therefore unenforceable.

I.FACTS

The subject of this proceeding is a two-story building
situated on the Broadway block between 94th and 95th Streets on Manhattan’s
Upper

West Side. In 1978, Broadwest Realty Corporation owned this
building, which housed a theater and commercial space. Broadwest had been

unable to secure a permanent tenant for the
theater—approximately 58% of the total square footage of the building’s floor
space. Broadwest also

owned two adjacent properties, Pomander Walk (a residential
complex) and the Healy Building (a commercial building). Broadwest had been

operating its properties at a net loss.

Plaintiff Symphony Space, Inc., a not-for-profit entity
devoted to the arts, had previously rented the theater for several one-night

engagements. In 1978, Symphony and Broadwest engaged in a
transaction whereby Broadwest sold the entire building to Symphony for the

below-market price of $10,010 and leased back the
income-producing commercial property, excluding the theater, for $1 per year.
Broadwest

#576

maintained liability for the existing $243,000 mortgage on
the property as well as certain maintenance obligations. As a condition of the
sale,

Symphony, for consideration of $10, also granted Broadwest
an option to repurchase the entire building. Notably, the transaction did not
involve

Pomander Walk or the Healy Building.

The purpose of this arrangement was to enable Symphony, as a
not-for-profit corporation, to seek a property tax exemption for the entire

building—which constituted a single tax parcel—predicated on
its use of the theater. The sale-and-leaseback would thereby reduce Broadwest’s

real estate taxes by $30,000 per year, while permitting
Broadwest to retain the rental income from the leased commercial space in the
building,

which the trial court found produced $140,000 annually. The
arrangement also furthered Broadwest’s goal of selling all the properties, by

allowing Broadwest to postpone any sale until property
values in the area increased and until the commercial leases expired. Symphony,
in turn,

would have use of the theater at minimal cost, once it
received a tax exemption.

Thus, on December 1, 1978, Symphony and Broadwest—both sides
represented by counsel—executed a contract for sale of the property

from Broadwest to Symphony for the purchase price of
$10,010. The contract specified that $10 was to be paid at the closing and
$10,000 was to

be paid by means of a purchase-money mortgage.

The parties also signed several separate documents, each
dated December 31, 1978: (1) a deed for the property from Broadwest to

Symphony; (2) a lease from Symphony to Broadwest of the
entire building except the theater for rent of $1 per year and for the term
January 1,

1979 to May 31, 2003, unless terminated earlier; (3) a
25-year, $10,000 mortgage and mortgage note from Symphony as mortgagor to
Broadwest

as mortgagee, with full payment due on December 31, 2003;
and (4) an option agreement by which Broadwest obtained from Symphony the

exclusive right to repurchase all of the property, including
the theater.

It is the option agreement that is at the heart of the
present dispute. Section 3 of that agreement provides that Broadwest may
exercise its

option to purchase the property during any of the following
“Exercise Periods”:

(a)at any time after July 1, 1979, so long as the Notice of
Election specifies that the Closing is to occur during any of the

calendar years 1987, 1993, 1998 and 2003;

(b)at any time following the maturity of the indebtedness
evidenced by the Note and secured by the Mortgage, whether by

acceleration or otherwise;

(c)during the ninety days immediately following any
termination of the Lease by the lessor thereof other than for nonpayment of

rent or any termination of the Lease by the lessee thereof *

#577

(d)during the ninety days immediately following the
thirtieth day after Broadwest shall have sent Symphony a notice specifying

a default by Symphony of any of its covenants or obligations
under the Mortgage.

Section 1 states that “Broadwest may exercise its option at
any time during any Exercise Period.” That section further specifies that the
notice of

election must be sent at least 180 days prior to the closing
date if the option is exercised pursuant to section 3(a) and at least 90 days
prior to the

closing date if exercised pursuant to any other subdivision.

The following purchase prices of the property, contingent
upon the closing date, are set forth in section 4: $15,000 if the closing date
is on

or before December 31, 1987; $20,000 if on or before
December 31, 1993; $24,000 if on or before December 31, 1998; and $28,000 if on
or

before December 31, 2003.

Importantly, the option agreement specifies in section 5
that “Broadwest’s right to exercise the option granted hereby is * * *
unconditional

and shall not be in any way affected or impaired by
Broadwest’s performance or nonperformance, actual or asserted, of any
obligation to be

performed under the Lease or any other agreement or
instrument by or between Broadwest and Symphony,” other than that Broadwest was

required to pay Symphony any unpaid rent on the closing
date. Finally, section 6 established that the option constituted “a covenant
running with

the land, inuring to the benefit of heirs, successors and
assigns of Broadwest.”

Symphony ultimately obtained a tax exemption for the
theater. In the summer of 1981, Broadwest sold and assigned its interest under
the

lease, option agreement, mortgage and mortgage note, as well
as its ownership interest in the contiguous Pomander Walk and Healy Building,
to

defendants’ nominee for $4.8 million. The nominee
contemporaneously transferred its rights under these agreements to defendants
Pergola

Properties, Inc., Bradford N. Swett, Casandium Limited and
Darenth Consultants as tenants in common.

Subsequently, defendants initiated a cooperative conversion
of Pomander Walk, which was designated a landmark in 1982, and the value of

the properties increased substantially. An August 1988
appraisal of the entire blockfront, including the Healy Building and the unused
air and

other development rights available from Pomander Walk,
valued the property at $27 million assuming the enforceability of the option.
By

contrast, the value of the leasehold interest plus the Healy
Building without the option were appraised at $5.5 million.

Due to Symphony’s alleged default on the mortgage note,
defendant Swett served Symphony with notice in January 1985 that it was

exercising the option on behalf of all defendants. The
notice set a closing date of May 6, 1985. Symphony, however, disputed both that
it was in

default and Swett’s authority to exercise the option for all
of the

#578

defendants. According to Symphony, moreover, it then
discovered that the option agreement was possibly invalid. Consequently, in
March 1985,

Symphony initiated this declaratory judgment action against
defendants, arguing that the option agreement violated the New York statutory

prohibition against remote vesting * * *

Defendant Pergola subsequently served Symphony with separate
notice of default dated April 4, 1985, informing Symphony that it was

exercising the option on behalf of all defendants pursuant
to sections 1, 3(b) and 3(d) of the option agreement and setting the closing
date for July

10, 1985. Pergola further notified Symphony that it was
alternatively exercising the option under section 3(a) of the option agreement,
which was

not contingent upon Symphony’s default, with the closing
date scheduled for January 5, 1 987. Symphony did not appear for any of the
closing

dates contained in Swett’s or Pergola’s notices. * * *

Thereafter, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment in
the instant declaratory judgment proceeding. The trial court granted

Symphony’s motion while denying that of defendants. In
particular, the court concluded that the Rule against Perpetuities applied to
the

commercial option contained in the parties’ agreement, that
the option violated the Rule and that Symphony was entitled to exercise its
equitable

right to redeem the mortgage. The trial court also dismissed
defendants’ counterclaim for rescission of the agreements underlying the
transaction

based on the parties’ mutual mistake.

In a comprehensive writing by Justice Ellerin, the Appellate
Division likewise determined that the commercial option was unenforceable

under the Rule against Perpetuities and that rescission was
inappropriate. The Appellate Division certified the following question to us:
“Was the

order of the Supreme Court, as affirmed by this Court,
properly made?” We conclude that it was and now affirm.

II.STATUTORY BACKGROUND

The Rule against Perpetuities evolved from judicial efforts
during the 17th century to limit control of title to real property by the dead
hand

of landowners reaching into future generations. Underlying
both early and modern rules restricting future dispositions of property is the
principle

that it is socially undesirable for property to be
inalienable for an unreasonable period of time. These rules thus seek “to
ensure the productive

use and development of property by its current beneficial
owners by simplifying ownership, facilitating exchange and freeing property
from

unknown or embarrassing impediments to alienability”
(Metropolitan Transp. Auth. v. Bruken Realty Corp., 492 N.E.2d 379, 381 (N.Y.
1986),

citing De Peyster v. Michael, 6 N.Y. 467, 494 (1852)).

The traditional statement of the common-law Rule against
Perpetuities was set forth by Professor John Chipman Gray: “No interest is good

unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one
years after

#579

some life in being at the creation of the interest” (Gray,
The Rule Against Perpetuities § 201, at 191 [4th ed. 1942]).

In New York, the rules regarding suspension of the power of
alienation and remoteness in vesting—the Rule against Perpetuities—have

been statutory since 18 30. Prior to 1958, the perpetuities
period was two lives in being plus actual periods of minority (see, Real
Property Law

former § 42). Widely criticized as unduly complex and
restrictive, the statutory period was revised in 1958 and 1960, restoring the
common-law

period of lives in being plus 21 years (see, L.1958, ch.
153; L.1960, ch. 448). * * *

New York’s current statutory Rule against Perpetuities is
found in EPTL 9–1.1. Subdivision (a) sets forth the suspension of alienation
rule

and deems void any estate in which the conveying instrument
suspends the absolute power of alienation for longer than lives in being at the

creation of the estate plus 21 years (see, EPTL
9–1.1[a][2]). The prohibition against remote vesting is contained in
subdivision (b), which states

that “[n]o estate in property shall be valid unless it must
vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after one or more lives in
being at the

creation of the estate and any period of gestation involved”
(EPTL 9–1.1[b]). This Court has described subdivision (b) as “a rigid formula
that

invalidates any interest that may not vest within the
prescribed time period” and has “capricious consequences” (Wildenstein &
Co. v. Wallis,

595 N.E.2d 828, 831–32 (N.Y. 1992)). Indeed, these rules are
predicated upon the public policy of the State and constitute non-waivable,
legal

prohibitions (see, Metropolitan Transp. Auth. v. Bruken
Realty Corp., 492 N.E.2d at 381).

In addition to these statutory formulas, New York also
retains the more flexible common-law rule against unreasonable restraints on

alienation. Unlike the statutory Rule against Perpetuities,
which is measured exclusively by the passage of time, the common-law rule
evaluates

the reasonableness of the restraint based on its duration,
purpose and designated method for fixing the purchase price. (See, Wildenstein
& Co. v.

Wallis, 595 N.E.2d at 832; Metropolitan Transp. Auth. v.
Bruken Realty Corp., 492 N.E.2d at 381–82).

Against this background, we consider the option agreement at
issue.

III.VALIDITY OF THE OPTION AGREEMENT

Defendants proffer three grounds for upholding the option:
that the statutory prohibition against remote vesting does not apply to

commercial options; that the option here cannot be exercised
beyond the statutory period; and that this Court should adopt the “wait and
see”

approach to the Rule against Perpetuities. We consider each
in turn.

A.Applicability of the Rule to Commercial Options

Under the common law, options to purchase land are subject
to the rule against remote vesting (see, Simes, Future Interests § 132 [2d ed.

1966]; Simes and Smith, Future Interests § 1244 [2d ed.];
Leach,

#580

Perpetuities in a Nutshell, 51 Harv.L.Rev. 638, 660; see
also, London & S.W. Ry. Co. v. Gomm, 20 Ch. D. 562 (C.A. 1882)). Such
options are

specifically enforceable and give the option holder a
contingent, equitable interest in the land (Dukeminier, A Modern Guide to
Perpetuities, 74

Cal.L.Rev. 1867, 1908; Leach, Perpetuities in Perspective:
Ending the Rule’s Reign of Terror, 65 Harv.L.Rev. 721, 736–737). This creates a

disincentive for the landowner to develop the property and
hinders its alienability, thereby defeating the policy objectives underlying
the Rule

against Perpetuities.

Typically, however, options to purchase are part of a
commercial transaction. For this reason, subjecting them to the Rule against

Perpetuities has been deemed “a step of doubtful wisdom”
(Leach, Perpetuities in Perspective: Ending the Rule’s Reign of Terror, 65
Harv.L.Rev.

737). As one vocal critic, Professor W. Barton Leach, has
explained,

[t]he Rule grew up as a limitation on family dispositions;
and the period of lives in being plus twenty-one years is adapted to these gift

transactions. The pressures which created the Rule do not
exist with reference to arms-length contractual transactions, and neither lives

in being nor twenty-one years are periods which are relevant
to business men and their affairs (Leach, Perpetuities: New Absurdity,

Judicial and Statutory Correctives, 73 Harv.L.Rev. 1318,
1321–1322).

Professor Leach, however, went on to acknowledge that, under
common law, “due to an overemphasis on concepts derived from the nineteenth

century, we are stuck with the application of the Rule to
options to purchase,” urging that “this should not be extended to other
commercial

transactions” (id., at 1322).

It is now settled in New York that, generally, EPTL 9–1.1(b)
applies to options. In Buffalo Seminary v. McCarthy, 86 A.D.2d 435, 440, 451

N.Y.S.2d 45 7, 461 (App. Div. 1982), aff’d 447 N.E.2d 76
(N.Y. 1983), the court held that an unlimited option in gross to purchase real
property

was void under the statutory rule against remote vesting,
and we affirmed the Appellate Division decision on the opinion of then-Justice

Hancock. Since then, we have reiterated that options in real
estate are subject to the statutory rule (see, e.g., Wildenstein & Co. v.
Wallis, 595

N.E.2d at 832). * * *

While defendants offer compelling policy reasons—echoing
those voiced by Professor Leach—for refusing to apply the traditional rule

against remote vesting to these commercial option contracts,
such statutory reformation would require legislative action similar to that

undertaken by numerous other State lawmakers (see, e.g.,
Cal.Prob.Code § 21225; Fla.Stat.Annot. ch. 689.225; Ill.Stat.Annot. ch. 765,
para.

305/4).

Our decision in Metropolitan Transp. Auth. v. Bruken Realty
Corp ., 492 N.E.2d 379, supra, is not to the contrary. In Bruken, we held that

#581

EPTL 9–1.1(b) did not apply to a preemptive right in a
“commercial and governmental transaction” that lasted beyond the statutory
perpetuities

period. In doing so, we explained that, unlike options,
preemptive rights (or rights of first refusal) only marginally affect
transferability:

An option grants to the holder the power to compel the owner
of property to sell it whether the owner is willing to part with ownership

or not. A preemptive right, or right of first refusal, does
not give its holder the power to compel an unwilling owner to sell; it merely

requires the owner, when and if he decides to sell, to offer
the property first to the party holding the preemptive right so that he may

meet a third-party offer or buy the property at some other
price set by a previously stipulated method (id. at 382).

Enforcement of the preemptive right in the context of the
governmental and commercial transaction, moreover, actually encouraged the use
and

development of the land, outweighing any minor impediment to
alienability (id. at 383–84). * * *

Here, the option agreement creates precisely the sort of
control over future disposition of the property that we have previously
associated

with purchase options and that the common-law rule against
remote vesting—and thus EPTL 9–1.1(b)—seeks to prevent. As the Appellate

Division explained, the option grants its holder absolute
power to purchase the property at the holder’s whim and at a token price set
far below

market value. This Sword of Damocles necessarily discourages
the property owner from investing in improvements to the property. Furthermore,

the option’s existence significantly impedes the owner’s
ability to sell the property to a third party, as a practical matter rendering
it inalienable.

That defendants, the holder of this option, are also the
lessees of a portion of the premises does not lead to a different conclusion
here.

Generally, an option to purchase land that originates in one
of the lease provisions, is not exercisable after lease expiration, and is
incapable

of separation from the lease is valid even though the
holder’s interest may vest beyond the perpetuities period (see, Berg, Long-Term
Options and

the Rule Against Perpetuities, 37 Cal.L.Rev. 1, 21; Leach,
Perpetuities: New Absurdity, Judicial and Statutory Correctives, 73 Harv.L.Rev.
1320;

Simes and Smith, Future Interests § 1244). Such
options—known as options “appendant” or “appurtenant” to leases—encourage the
possessory

holder to invest in maintaining and developing the property
by guaranteeing the option holder the ultimate benefit of any such investment.

Options appurtenant thus further the policy objectives
underlying the rule against remote vesting and are not contemplated by EPTL
9–1.1(b)

(see, Metropolitan Transp. Auth. v. Bruken Realty Corp., 492
N.E.2d at 383–84, supra).

To be sure, the option here arose within a larger
transaction that included a lease. Nevertheless, not all of the property
subject to the

#582

purchase option here is even occupied by defendants. The
option encompasses the entire building—both the commercial space and the
theater—

yet defendants are leasing only the commercial space. With
regard to the theater space, a disincentive exists for Symphony to improve the

property, since it will eventually be claimed by the option
holder at the predetermined purchase price. * * *

Put simply, the option here cannot qualify as an option
appurtenant and significantly deters development of the property. If the option
is

exercisable beyond the statutory perpetuities period,
refusing to enforce it would thus further the purpose and rationale underlying
the statutory

prohibition against remote vesting.

B.Duration of the Option Agreement

1.Duration Under Section 3(a) of the Agreement

Defendants alternatively claim that section 3 (a) of the
agreement does not permit exercise of the option after expiration of the
statutory

perpetuities period. According to defendants, only the
possible closing dates fall outside the permissible time frame.

Where, as here, the parties to a transaction are
corporations and no measuring lives are stated in the instruments, the
perpetuities period is

simply 21 years (see, Metropolitan Transp. Auth. v. Bruken
Realty Corp., 492 N.E.2d at 381, supra). Section 1 of the parties’ agreement
allows

the option holder to exercise the option “at any time during
any Exercise Period” set forth in section three. Section 3(a), moreover,
expressly

provides that the option may be exercised “ at any time
after July 1, 1979,” so long as the closing date is scheduled during 1987,
1993, 1998 or

Even factoring in the requisite notice, then, the option
could potentially be exercised as late as July 2003—more than 24 years after
its

creation in December 1 978. Defendants’ contention that
section 3(a) does not permit exercise of the option beyond the 21-year period
is thus

contradicted by the plain language of the instrument.

Nor can EPTL 9–1.3—the “saving statute”—be invoked to
shorten the duration of the exercise period under section 3(a) of the
agreement.

That statute mandates that, “[u]nless a contrary intention
appears,” certain rules of construction govern with respect to any matter
affecting the

Rule against Perpetuities (EPTL 9–1.3[a]). The specified
canons of construction include that “[i]t shall be presumed that the creator
intended the

estate to be valid” (EPTL 9–1.3[b]) and “[w]here the
duration or vesting of an estate is contingent upon * * * the occurrence of any
specified

contingency, it shall be presumed that the creator of such
estate intended such contingency to occur, if at all, within twenty-one years
from the

effective date of the instrument creating such estate” (EPTL
9–1.3[d]).

By presuming that the creator intended the estate to be
valid, the statute seeks to avoid annulling dispositions due to inadvertent
violations

of the Rule against Perpetuities. The provisions of EPTL 9–

#583

1.3, however, are merely rules of construction. While the
statute obligates reviewing courts, where possible, to avoid constructions that
frustrate

the parties’ intended purposes, it does not authorize courts
to rewrite instruments that unequivocally allow interests to vest outside the

perpetuities period (compare, EPTL 9–1.2 [reducing age
contingency to 21 years, where interest is invalid because contingent on a
person

reaching an age in excess of 21 years]).

Indeed, by their terms, the rules of construction in EPTL
9–1.3 apply only if “a contrary intention” does not appear in the instrument. *

The unambiguous language of the agreement here expresses the
parties’ intent that the option be exercisable “at any time” during a 24-year

period pursuant to section 3(a). The section thus does not
permit a construction that the parties intended the option to last only 21
years.

Given the contrary intention manifested in the instrument
itself, the saving statute is simply inapplicable. * * *

C.“Wait and See” Approach

Defendants next urge that we adopt the “wait and see”
approach to the Rule against Perpetuities: an interest is valid if it actually
vests

during the perpetuities period, irrespective of what might
have happened (see, Dukeminier, A Modern Guide to Perpetuities, 74 Cal.L.Rev.
1867,

1880). The option here would survive under the “wait and
see” approach since it was exercised by 1987, well within the 21-year
limitation.

This Court, however, has long refused to “wait and see”
whether a perpetuities violation in fact occurs. As explained in Matter of
Fischer ,

120 N.E.2d 688, 692 (N.Y. 1954), “[i]t is settled beyond
dispute that in determining whether a will has illegally suspended the power of

alienation, the courts will look to what might have happened
under the terms of the will rather than to what has actually happened since the
death

of the testator.”

The very language of EPTL 9–1.1, moreover, precludes us from
determining the validity of an interest based upon what actually occurs

during the perpetuities period. Under the statutory rule
against remote vesting, an interest is invalid “unless it must vest, if at all,
not later than

twenty-one years after one or more lives in being” (EPTL
9–1.1[b] [emphasis added]). That is, an interest is void from the outset if it
may vest

too remotely * * * Because the option here could have vested
after expiration of the 21-year perpetuities period, it offends the Rule.

We note that the desirability of the “wait and see” doctrine
has been widely debated (see, 5A Powell, Real Property ¶ 827F[1], [3]; see
also,

Waggoner, Perpetuity Reform, 81 Mich.L.Rev. 1718 [describing
“wait and see” as “(t)he most controversial of the reform methods”]). Its

incorporation into EPTL 9–1.1, in any event, must be
accomplished by the Legislature, not the courts.

#584

We therefore conclude that the option agreement is invalid
under EPTL 9–1.1(b). In light of this conclusion, we need not decide whether
the

option violated Symphony’s equitable right to redeem the
mortgage.

IV.REMEDY

As a final matter, defendants argue that, if the option
fails, the contract of sale conveying the property from Broadwest to Symphony
should

be rescinded due to the mutual mistake of the parties. We
conclude that rescission is inappropriate * * *

A contract entered into under mutual mistake of fact is
generally subject to rescission (see, Matter of Gould v. Board of Educ., 616
N.E.2d

142, 145 (N.Y. 1993)). CPLR 3005 provides that when relief
against mistake is sought, it shall not be denied merely because the mistake is
one

of law rather than fact. Relying on this provision,
defendants maintain that neither Symphony nor Broadwest realized that the
option violated the

Rule against Perpetuities at the time they entered into the
agreement and that both parties intended the option to be enforceable.

CPLR 3005, however, does not equate all mistakes of law with
mistakes of fact * * *

Here, the parties’ mistake amounts to nothing more than a
misunderstanding as to the applicable law, and CPLR 3005 does not direct

undoing of the transaction * * *

The remedy of rescission, moreover, lies in equity and is a
matter of discretion (Rudman v. Cowles Communications, 280 N.E.2d 867, 874

(N.Y. 1972)). Defendants’ plea that the unenforceability of
the option is contrary to the intent of the original parties ignores that the
effect of the

Rule against Perpetuities—which is a statutory prohibition,
not a rule of construction—is always to defeat the intent of parties who create
a

remotely vesting interest. As explained by the Appellate
Division, there is “an irreconcilable conflict in applying a remedy which is
designed to

void a transaction because it fails to carry out the
parties’ true intent to a transaction in which the mistake made by the parties
was the application

of the Rule against Perpetuities, the purpose of which is to
defeat the intent of the parties.”

The Rule against Perpetuities reflects the public policy of
the State. Granting the relief requested by defendants would thus be contrary
to

public policy, since it would lead to the same result as
enforcing the option and tend to compel performance of contracts violative of
the Rule.

Similarly, damages are not recoverable where options to
acquire real property violate the Rule against Perpetuities, since that would
amount to

giving effect to the option (see, 5A Powell, Real Property ¶
771[3]).

Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be
affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.

Symphony Space, New York City, in 2006

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Should the RAP apply to commercial transactions like the
one in Symphony Space, or should it be limited to contingent interests created
in the

family wealth transmission context, where the rule
originated? If one views the rule as primarily concerned with tempering the
desire to create dynastic

wealth, then limiting it to the family context would make
sense. But are the other policies motivating the RAP—a desire to eliminate
restraints on

alienation and to limit dead hand control over the ownership
and use of resources—limited to the family context? Another issue about the
scope of the

RAP is whether it should apply to interests that provide
only for the future payment of money. Suppose the Perpetual Insurance Company
issues a life

insurance policy to A in return for a large premium that
promises to pay stated sums of money to “such grandchildren of A that reach age
30 .” Such a

promise does not raise any concerns about restraints on
alienation, because the Perpetual Insurance Co. can invest the premium payment
in a variety of

ways unconstrained by the promise to make the future
payments. Similarly, it does not seem that the contract involves excessive dead
hand control over

the future use and disposition of resources. Might it
nevertheless be objectionable as a way of creating dynastic wealth? Suppose A
(who is very rich)

purchases a policy that promises to pay all lineal
descendants of A $ 1

```

```

million when they turn 30 in perpetuity? See Holmes v. John
Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., 41 N.E. 2 d 909 (N.Y. 1942 ) (suggesting that the
RAP does

not apply to life insurance payments, which constitute
deferred payments and not income on property).

2 .The RAP traditionally applies to options, and this can be
a big problem especially because, as in _Symphony Space_ , a corporation is not
treated as

a measuring life. See also Central Delaware County Authority
v. Greyhound Corp., 588 A. 2 d 485 (Pa. 1991 ). Some states, especially those
following the

USRAP approach, exempt options from the Rule. Similarly,
section 3. 3 of the _Restatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes_ would exempt
all options

from the RAP but subject them to the prohibitions on
unreasonable restraints on alienation. In contrast, rights of first refusal
such as those retained by a

cooperative or condominium board, which apply when a sitting
occupant wants to sell, are not subject to the RAP. Likewise, options given to
a lessee to

renew the lease or purchase the land are not subject to the
RAP, because it is thought that they do not inhibit but encourage improvement
of the property.

Notice that these distinctions—between options in gross on
the one hand (as in _Symphony Space_ ) and options given to lessees and rights
of first refusal

on the other hand—do not follow from the supposedly
“remorseless” logic of the RAP, which would presumably subject all such
contingencies to the

rule. Rather, the distinctions are grounded in judicial
intuitions about the policy consequences of either applying or not applying the
RAP. Are courts

competent to make these kinds of judgments? Should courts
simply follow the logic of the RAP in all cases and wait for the legislature to
create

exceptions? Or should courts limit the RAP to the family
wealth transmission context and wait for the legislature to create extensions?

3 .Courts often interpret ambiguous deeds or even those with
contradictory phrases so as to avoid invalidation under the RAP, but some
courts will

go further than others. The court in _Symphony Space_ noted
this possibility but saw the New York statute as forbidding the court from
engaging in the

rewriting of the option agreement that would have been
required to make it conform to the RAP. Other courts are far more
accommodating. See, e.g.,

Matter of Estate of Anderson, 541 So. 2 d 423 (Miss. 1989 ).

4 .What if the option had been reserved in the grantor
Broadwest Realty instead of granted back by Symphony Space after a conveyance
of the

entire estate from Broadwest to Symphony? Some courts would
see the option as an interest that is immediately vested and so presenting no
issue with

the RAP. Others, like the New York courts, view the exercise
of the option as a cutting-off event like that in an executory interest, thus
making the RAP

applicable even if the option is reserved in the grantor.
Which view is better? Does this have anything to do with the wisdom of applying
the RAP?

5 .Why did the court strike the entire option under the RAP,
rather than just striking the final closing date of 2003? If the option had
provided that

the last possible closing date was 1998 , this would have
been less than 21 years after the option contract was created, and hence would
not have

```



587



```

violated the rule. The court rejects the argument that the
option agreement should be interpreted so as to provide an earlier date of
execution of the

option. But isn’t there also an issue as to how much of the
option contract the RAP will be deemed to invalidate?

6 .Interestingly, the RAP started out its career as a
flexible and equitable standard. This is reflected in Lord Chancellor
Nottingham’s statement that

future interests should be invalidated for remoteness
“whereever any visible Inconvenience doth appear; for the just Bounds of a
Fee-simple upon a Fee-

simple are not yet determined.” Duke of Norfolk’s Case, 22
Eng. Rep. 931 , 960 (Ch. 1682 ). Only later did the RAP crystallize into a hard
rule. Hirsch &

Wang, supra, at 55 n. 223. Are rules or standards more
appropriate here?

7 .As mentioned earlier, one of the policies behind the RAP
is the limiting of dead hand control. One area in which this concern about
rigidity over

time has been raised is conservation easements, in which an
owner of land grants away (typically for all time) the right to develop the
land. (See Chapter

IX.) Power to enforce the restriction is typically given to
a governmental or nonprofit body. What if it turns out years later that the
land could be put to

higher use, or that other land is more valuable in an
undeveloped state, or even that notions of developed and undeveloped change?
See Julia Mahoney,

Perpetual Restrictions on Land and the Problem of the
Future, 88 Va. L. Rev. 739 ( 2002 ).

Vestigial Maintenance Doctrines

There are a number of doctrines that served at one time to
clean up conveyances and make them more alienable than they otherwise might

have been. In recent times, future interests have been made
more fully alienable than they were at common law, thus alleviating some of the

problems courts traditionally faced. In addition, as already
mentioned, most future interests are now created in trust, where the trustee
can be

given powers of alienation and appointment, and the entire
arrangement, as far as management and distribution of the proceeds are
concerned,

can be customized to a degree impossible within the
catalogue of legal estates and interests.

Four traditional maintenance rules are the Merger Rule, the
Rule in Shelley’s Case, the Doctrine of Worthier Title, and the Destructibility
of

Contingent Remainders. Probably only the first remains in
full force and effect in most states today. The others have either been
abolished, or

live on only as rules of construction.

The Merger Rule. Before the feudal incidents were abolished
by Parliament in 1660, landowners would attempt various stratagems to

avoid them, especially the requirement of paying relief in
order to allow property to pass to descendants upon death (an early version of
the estate

tax). Tenants fearing an early demise also wished to avoid
wardship, which allowed the lord to take and keep the full value of the
property during

the minority of an heir. The common-law courts devised a
number

#588

of doctrines to block these efforts at evasion of the feudal
incidents and wardship. One stratagem would be for O, in one instrument, to
convey

“to A for life.” This of course would create an implied
reversion in O. O would then execute a second instrument, conveying his
reversion to A.

A now held both a life estate and the reversion at the end
of the life estate—which together adds up to a fee simple absolute—but A would
have

acquired these interests by inter vivos conveyances, not by
descent. Courts held that when this happened, the two separate conveyances were

merged, and A would be treated as having a fee simple
absolute. The same rule holds if A receives both a life estate and a vested
remainder in

fee simple, or if A conveys the life estate back to O who
still holds the reversion, or any other combination of transfers that puts in
the hands of a

single person a series of interests that add up to a larger
estate. Whatever its original motivation, the merger rule clearly promotes free
alienation

of property (can you see why?), and so it is still followed
today.

The Rule in Shelley’s Case. In another device to avoid
having to pay relief, landowners would sometimes attempt to convey property
while

still alive in such a way that persons would take as
purchasers rather than by descent. For example, O might convey in a single
instrument “to A

for life, then to A’s heirs.” In a rule first recognized in
Abel’s Case, Y.B. 18 Edw. II, 577 (1324), and given its definite form in
Shelley’s Case, 76

Eng. Rep. 206 (K.B. 1 581), this stratagem was blocked.
Under the rule, if someone uses a single instrument to create a life estate in
land in A,

and also to create a remainder in persons described as A’s
heirs (or the heirs of A’s body), and the life estate and the remainder are
both legal or

both equitable, then the interest becomes a fee simple (or
fee tail) in A. The Rule is a mandatory rule and is not overcome by
manifestation of

contrary grantor intent. Today, the Rule in Shelley’s Case
has been abolished in most states, but lives on in a few, primarily on the
theory that it

promotes alienability of land. (Again, can you see why the
application of the rule would make land more alienable?)

Doctrine of Worthier Title. Another scheme to avoid relief
would be for a grantor to attempt to create a remainder or executory interest
in

his own (the grantor’s) heirs. Thus, O would grant “to A for
life, then to the heirs of O.” This was blocked by the Doctrine of Worthier
Title,

which converted what was in form a remainder in the heirs of
O into a reversion in the grantor. Thus, “to A for life, then to the heirs of
O,” would

be treated as if it had said “to A for life, then to O.”
Again, whatever its original rationale, the rule marginally contributes to
alienability. If O

could make a grant to “the heirs of O,” no one would be in a
position to negotiate with anyone else as long as O is alive, because O’s heirs
have

not yet been determined. If the grant is construed as
creating a reversion in O, then O can negotiate for a transfer. To the extent
the doctrine lives

on today, it is as a rule of construction, not a fixed rule
of law like the Rule in Shelley’s Case. See Doctor v. Hughes, 122 N.E. 221
(N.Y. 1919).

#589

In theory, a grantor could overcome the presumption in the
rule by using language exhibiting a contrary intent.

Destructibility of Contingent Remainders. Traditionally, if
a (legal, not equitable) contingent remainder in real property failed to take

immediately on the termination of all the preceding estates,
it would be destroyed. For example, if O conveyed Blackacre “to A for life,
then to B

if B passes the bar,” and A died before B had passed the
bar, the rule would destroy the contingent remainder. Who would take? O would,

because of the supporting reversion retained by O. The
destructibility rule seems to have come about because of a fixation on the
definition of a

remainder as an interest that takes effect upon the natural
termination of a prior estate (death). See Thomas F. Bergin & Paul G.
Haskell, Preface

to Estates in Land and Future Interests 77–79 (2d ed. 1984).
In the example, supposing A dies before B passes the bar, if B were
subsequently to

take the property this would cut short O’s reversion; it
would not follow the termination of a life estate like a well-behaved remainder
should. Of

course, by destroying the contingent remainder, the courts
also frustrated O’s intentions, all in the name of preserving the correct
definition of a

remainder. Today, the destructibility rule has largely
vanished. Since the grantor could have accomplished the same result by creating
an

executory interest, courts treat a contingent remainder that
does not become possessory upon the natural termination of the previous estate
as if it

were an executory interest. All states with clear law on the
point, except Florida, have abolished the rule, although in a handful of
additional

states there are older precedents accepting the rule that
have not been expressly overruled. In any event, since the doctrine never
applied to

equitable interests in trusts, and most contingent
remainders today are created in trusts, the rule has little effect even in the
rare state where it

might be enforced.

### 4 .SYSTEMICALLY INTERACTING PRINCIPLES

The various maintenance doctrines and limiting principles
work together (or fail to!) as a system. As we saw with the estate system,
various

rules (like that creating a life estate and a reminder in
fee simple out of a fee simple) can feed themselves. Other interactions between
principles

are possible. Consider how many of the maintenance doctrines
and limiting principles come into play in the following case.

#### City of Klamath Falls v. Bell

```



Oregon Court of Appeals, 1971.



490 P. 2 d 515.



```

■
SCHWAB, CHIEF JUDGE. In 1925, a corporation conveyed certain land to the city
of Klamath Falls as a gift for use as the site for a city library.

The deed provided, among other things, that the city should
hold the land “so long as” it complied with that condition with regard to its
use.

#590

In 196 9, the city terminated the use of the land for a
library, and the question presented by this appeal is, “Does the title to the
land remain

in the city or did the termination of use as a library cause
title to pass to the descendants of the shareholders of the donor-corporation
(now

dissolved)?”

The issue was presented to the trial court in the form of an
agreed narrative statement, pertinent portions of which, in addition to the
facts

set forth above, are: the donor-corporation was known as the
Daggett-Schallock Investment Company; the corporate deed provided that if at
any

time the city ceased to use the land for library purposes,
title to the land should pass to Fred Schallock and Floy R. Daggett, their
heirs and

assigns; on September 19, 1927, the corporation was
voluntarily dissolved, all creditors paid, and all assets (which we interpret
as including the

rights of the corporation, if any, in the land in question)
were distributed in accordance with law to the sole shareholders Schallock and
Daggett.

The city of Klamath Falls built a library on the land in
1929 in compliance with the conditions set out in the deed. The library
continued in

use from that date until July 1, 1969, when the books were
moved to the County Library Building. Since that time, the city library
services have

been provided by Klamath County on a contract basis. The
City Library building has not been used for any other purpose and now stands
vacant.

After the library closure, the city of Klamath Falls filed a
complaint against all the heirs of Schallock and Daggett for declaratory
judgment

pursuant to ORS ch. 28, asking the court to adjudicate the
respective rights of the parties under the deed. The city joined Constance F.
Bell, the

sole heir of Fred Schallock, and Marijane Flitcraft and
Caroline Crapo, the sole heirs of Floy R. Daggett, along with George C.
Flitcraft, the

husband of Marijane Flitcraft, and Paul Crapo, the husband
of Caroline Crapo, as all the necessary parties to the suit.

The defendants Constance F. Bell, Caroline Crapo, and Paul
Crapo conveyed their interests in the real property to the defendant Marijane

Flitcraft in May and June 1970.

The trial court found that title to the real property was
vested in the city of Klamath Falls. Its decision was based on a finding that
the gift

over to Fred Schallock and Floy R. Daggett was void under
the rule against perpetuities.

The deed, in pertinent part, is as follows:

KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS That Daggett-Schallock
Investment Company, a corporation organized and existing under

the laws of the State of Oregon, for and as a gift and
without any consideration, does hereby give, grant and convey unto the City of

Klamath Falls, Oregon, so long as it complies with the
conditions hereinafter set forth, and thereafter unto Fred Schallock and Floy
R.

Daggett, their heirs and assigns, the following described
parcel of real estate, in Klamath County Oregon, to-wit * * *

To have and to hold the same unto the said City of Klamath
Falls, Oregon (and to any other municipal corporation which may lawfully

succeed it) so long as it complies with the conditions above
set forth, and thereafter unto Fred Schallock and Floy R. Daggett, their

heirs and assigns forever. * * *

I

We conclude that the estate that passed to the city under
this deed was a fee simple on a special limitation, which is also known as a
fee

simple determinable, or a base or qualified fee. * The
“magic” words “so long as” have generally been held to create such an estate.
Simes and

Smith, The Law of Future Interests 345, § 287 (2d ed. 1956),
states:

#592

* * * The words of duration “so long as” will almost
      certainly be judicially recognized as the distinctive insignia of such an
      estate, and,

if coupled with a provision which clearly calls for an
automatic termination of the estate granted, there is little room for
construction.

---

O’Connell, Estates on Condition Subsequent and Estates on
Special Limitation in Oregon, 18 Or.L.Rev. 63, 73 (1939), stresses the use of
words:

[T]he creation of an estate on a special limitation is
characterized generally by the use of certain words. Typical words are “so long
as,”

“until,” or “during.” However, any language in the
instrument indicating an intent that the estate shall automatically end upon
the

occurrence of a designated event will be sufficient.

See also Magness v. Kerr, 254 P. 1012 (Or. 1927).

One of the features of the fee simple on a special
limitation thus created is that it terminates automatically upon breach of
condition.^2

Fremont Lbr. Co. v. Starrell Pet. Co., 364 P.2d 773 (Or.
1961), and cases cited therein.

II

Upon breach of the condition, the deed provided for a gift
over to Fred Schallock and Floy R. Daggett or their heirs and assigns. This
gift

over was an attempt to grant an executory interest since
only an executory interest can follow an earlier grant in fee simple.

The rule against perpetuities applies to executory
interests; Closset et al. v. Burtchaell et al., 230 P. 554 (Or. 1924).

Gray’s classic statement of the rule is as follows:

NO INTEREST IS GOOD UNLESS IT MUST VEST, IF AT ALL, NOT
LATER THAN TWENTY-ONE YEARS AFTER SOME LIFE IN

BEING AT THE CREATION OF THE INTEREST. Gray, The Rule
Against Perpetuities 191, § 201 (4th ed. 1942).

One of the main characteristics of a defeasible fee simple
estate is that the first grantee might continue in possession in perpetuity.
The city

of Klamath Falls could have maintained a library on the site
for an indefinite time in the future, or even forever. Therefore, the trial
judge correctly

found that the gift over to Fred Schallock and Floy R.
Daggett, their heirs and assigns, was void ab initio under the rule against
perpetuities.

#593

III

The trial court’s conclusion does not, however, dispose of
the case at bar. Just because the gift over is invalid, it does not follow that
the city

of Klamath Falls now has an absolute interest in the
property in question. There remains the question of whether under the deed a
possibility of

reverter remained in the grantor corporation.

When a deed reveals an unquestionable intent to limit the
interest of the first grantee (here the city of Klamath Falls) to a fee simple
on a

special limitation, the courts of the United States do not
create an indefeasible estate in the first grantee when a subsequent executory
interest

(here that of Schallock and Daggett) is void under the rule
against perpetuities. Instead, the grantor (here the corporation) retains an
interest

known as a possibility of reverter.^3

The general rule has been stated to be:

[W]hen an executory interest, following a fee simple
interest in land * * * is void under the rule against perpetuities, the prior
interest

becomes absolute unless the language of the creating
instrument makes it very clear that the prior interest is to terminate whether
the

executory interest takes effect or not.

Simes and Smith, The Law of Future Interests 316, 318, § 827
(2d ed. 1956).

All the jurisdictions in the United States which have dealt
with a determinable fee and an executory interest void under the rule against

perpetuities have followed this rule. * * * This conclusion
is favored by Restatement, 2 Property, app. 34–47, §§ 228, 229. * * *

IV

However, before this conclusion can be reached, an unusual
Oregon rule must be considered. Oregon is one of a small minority of states

that holds that a possibility of reverter cannot be
alienated, Magness v. Kerr, 254 P. 1012 (Or. 1927); see Annotation, 53 A.L.R.2d
224 (1957),

but the Oregon Supreme Court has never held that an attempt
to alienate a possibility of reverter destroys it. In the case at bar, the
grantor-

corporation did attempt to alienate the possibility of
reverter with its abortive gift over to Schallock and Daggett.^4 Thus, the
question of

#594

whether an attempt to alienate a possibility of reverter
destroys it is presented to an Oregon appellate court for the first time. * * *

In Pure Oil Co. v. Miller-McFarland Drilling Co., 34 N.E.2d
854 (Ill. 1941), the Illinois court held that a possibility of reverter is not

destroyed when the grantor tries to transfer it, even though
the possibility of reverter is not alienable under Illinois law. In Reichard v.
Chicago,

B. & Q. R. Co., 1 N.W.2d 721 (Iowa 1942), which involved
a conveyance after termination of a fee simple subject to a special limitation,
the

same facts as in Magness v. Kerr, supra, the court said:

It seems rather fantastic to us, that a conveyance which is
ineffective to convey what it attempts to convey is nevertheless an effective

means of destroying it.

1 N.W.2d at 729.

We hold that an attempt by a grantor to transfer his
possibility of reverter does not destroy it.

V

The remaining issue is the city’s contention that upon
dissolution of the corporation in 1 927, or at the latest, upon the
post-dissolution,

winding-up period, ORS 57.630(2),^5 the corporation was
civilly dead and without a successor to whom the possibility of reverter could
descend.

As is pointed out in Addy v. Short, 89 A.2d 136, 139 (Del.
1952), the statutory provision for distribution of corporate assets upon
dissolution,

is in effect a statutory expansion of the equitable doctrine
that upon dissolution of a corporation its property, notwithstanding the

technical rules of the early common law, does not escheat to
the sovereign or revert to the original grantor, and will be administered

* * * for the purpose of winding up the corporate affairs
      and distributing the assets to those equitably entitled to them.

In Addy , the corporation owning a possibility of reverter
was dissolved and five years later the event (the abandonment of the use upon

which the deed was conditioned) occurred. Delaware had only
a three-

#595

year corporate dissolution winding-up period. The Delaware
statutes did contain a provision that even after the three-year period, upon

application of creditors or shareholders of a dissolved
corporation, the court could appoint a receiver to take charge of the estate of
the

corporation and to collect debts and property due and
belonging to the company. Addy held that neither the dissolution of the
corporation nor the

expiration of the three-year dissolution period worked an
extinguishment of the possibility of reverter retained by the deed in question,
and that

upon the abandonment of the land by the grantee, the
possibility of reverter was enlarged to a fee simple title. It further held
that as statutory

successors to the rights and powers of the corporation the
receivers were entitled to the land.

Oregon has no such receivership statute, but the Oregon
statutes make it clear that corporate assets no longer escheat or revert to the
original

grantor upon dissolution. In this case, the parties agree
that the corporation was lawfully dissolved, all the creditors paid, and that
Daggett and

Schallock, the sole shareholders of the corporation, were
statutorily entitled to and did receive all of the remaining assets of the
corporation. One

such asset was the possibility of reverter of the land in
question.

The parties further agree that the defendants in this case
were all of the heirs of Daggett and Schallock. As is pointed out in 18
Or.L.Rev. 63,

supra, there is no Oregon decision on the issue of the
descendability of the possibility of reverter. However, the weight of authority
recognizes

that such an interest is descendable. Restatement, 2
Property 606, Comment A, § 164, and 3 Simes 144–45, § 707 (1936). We discern no
sound

policy considerations which lead us to a contrary
conclusion.^6

Marijane Flitcraft acquired all rights to the property when
the other defendants conveyed their interests to her in 1970.

Reversed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Do you see how this decision involves an application of
the principle of conservation of estates? The Daggett-Schallock Investment
Company

started out with a fee simple absolute having an unlimited
duration. It executed a deed that carved this fee simple up into two smaller
interests: a fee

simple subject to an executory limitation, which was donated
to the City, and an executory interest, which was conveyed to the two principal

shareholders of the Company, Daggett and Schallock. (The
corporation is assumed to have a legal personality separate and distinct from
its shareholders;

they are, for legal purposes, regarded as separate
“persons.”) Many years later, the executory interest is declared void under the
Rule against

Perpetuities. This means that there is now something left
over which

```



596



```

has not been accounted for—the interest originally occupied
by the executory interest—and the difficult question for the court is what sort
of legal

interest should be implied as a matter of law to fill the
void. The perceived imperative that this gap must be filled in order to account
for the unlimited

duration of the original fee simple is the principle of
conservation of estates.

2 .The court discusses two possibilities for filling the
gap. First, as argued by the City, the interest originally given to the City—a
fee simple

subject to an executory limitation—could be expanded into a
fee simple absolute. One could say that the City had a fee simple with a
forfeiture cloud

hanging over its head; the mechanism for enforcing the
forfeiture has been declared void; ergo the cloud has now been lifted. Second,
as argued by the

heirs of Daggett and Shallock, the court invalidating the
executory interest can imply a possibility of reverter in the grantor—the
Investment Company

—and then, given that the corporation has been dissolved,
award the possibility of reverter to the shareholders of the corporation
(Daggett and Schallock

as it happens) and thus to their successors. In a subsequent
decision, the court decided that a possibility of reverter is alienable in
Oregon. State ex rel.

Dept. of Transportation v. Tolke, 586 P. 2 d 791 (Or. Ct.
App. 1978 ). Does it matter to the result in this case if the possibility of
reverter is alienable?

3 .Assuming the legal authorities were sufficiently balanced
to permit the court to embrace either the City’s view or the heirs’ view, why
do you

suppose the court found the heirs’ position more appealing?
What was the purpose of imposing the executory limitation in the first place?
If invalidated

executory interests always result in the expansion of the
underlying defeasible fee into a fee simple absolute, what effect might this
have on the

incentives of persons to make charitable donations of
property?

4 .There was a third option for filling the gap in _City of
Klamath Falls_ : The court could have held that the possibility of reverter
escheated to the

State of Oregon. Can you articulate the argument that would
support this outcome? What advantages and disadvantages would this solution
have relative

to the two options considered by the court? Should the court
have notified the attorney general of Oregon and allowed him or her to enter an
appearance

to argue in support of escheat? (Note that the State of
Oregon and the City of Klamath Falls are different political entities, and
might put the land to

different uses or spend the proceeds from selling the land
in different ways.) Should courts adopt a presumption against escheat? In favor
of escheat?

Should it depend on the nature of the property? Suppose the
corporation dissolved in 1927 and the city stops using the land as a library
100 years later.

Suppose further that there are over one hundred descendants
of the original shareholders, and, unlike the descendants in the _City of
Klamath Falls_ case,

they cannot agree on a consolidation of their interests. Who
is going to take responsibility for notifying all the heirs of their interests,
and representing

them in court? Will the transaction costs of identifying and
adjudicating the claims of the heirs eat up most of the value of the property
in dispute?

```



5 .Interests less than a fee simple can be held void for
reasons of public policy or constitutionality. In Evans v. Newton , 382 U.S.
296 ( 1966 ),



```

```



597



```

the Supreme Court considered the will of Senator A.O. Bacon
of Georgia, who died in 1911. The will left a tract of land, known as
Baconsfield, to the

city of Macon for use as a park restricted to white persons
only. The Court held that Macon could not continue to operate the park on a
segregated basis

because this would violate the Equal Protection Clause. On
remand, the Georgia courts considered whether to revise the will under the cy
pres doctrine

(see Chapter VI) by striking out the racial restriction, or
to declare that the gift to the city had failed. Based on evidence in the will
that Senator Bacon

was adamant about wanting no mixing of the races in the
park, the Georgia courts declared that the gift had failed. Although the will
contained no

residuary clause, the Georgia courts implied a reversion in
the heirs of Senator Bacon. Thus, the park passed by operation of law back into
the family’s

hands. On further review, a divided Supreme Court affirmed.
Evans v. Abney, 396 U.S. 435 ( 1970 ). The Court concluded that the result,
although

unfortunate, simply reflected a good faith application of
state law rules for interpreting and administering wills: Senator Bacon lived
and died in a racist

era, and the Georgia courts were simply giving effect to his
intent. Justices Douglas and Brennan dissented, arguing that the judgment, by
perpetuating

the discriminatory intentions of Senator Bacon, was state
action in violation of the equal protection guarantee. Relying in part on
_Shelley v. Kraemer_ ,

Chapter IV, which invalidated judicial enforcement of
private racial covenants, they would have reversed.

6 .In considering the effect of an invalid condition in a
defeasible fee, might it make a difference whether the grantor used the
language of a fee

simple determinable or a fee simple subject to condition
subsequent? If the executory limitation in _City of Klamath Falls_ had been
expressed using

condition subsequent language (“but if” or “provided that”)
rather than durational language (“so long as”), the City might well have won.

why? See Restatement of Property § ( 1936 ); see also
Hermitage Methodist Homes of Virginia, Inc. v. Dominion Trust Co., 387 S.E. 2 d
740 , 745 – 46 (Va.

1990 ) (holding that racially restrictive trust interests
expressed as a fee simple determinable failed entirely, as opposed to an
invalid interest expressed as

a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, which would
have avoided forfeiture); Jonathan L. Entin, Defeasible Fees, State Action, and

### E. CO-OWNERSHIP AND MEDIATING CONFLICTS BETWEEN

CO-OWNERS

There are many reasons for multiple people to wish to be
co-owners, involving various types of multiple use and relationships based on

sharing. But conflicts among co-owners can arise for a
variety of reasons. The effects of the use by each co-owner are only partially
internalized

to that owner. That is why in many situations co-owners need
some governance scheme, such as a contract or, more usually, a set of norms of

proper use, to regulate their use and care of the property.
In addition to these norms, the law itself sometimes provides off-the-rack
solutions to

problems facing co-owners. These legal solutions tend to
take two forms.

#598

One is to afford co-owners exit from the relationship; this
is achieved primarily by the action for partition. The other is a set of more
detailed

governance rules. These rules tend not to be as finegrained
as the contractual and norm-based rules that co-owners devise for themselves,
and the

law’s off-the-rack regime tends to protect co-owners mainly
in situations of exit. In many American jurisdictions, holders of concurrent
interests

are quite limited in the remedies available to them, and
co-owners in some jurisdictions often wind up seeking an accounting in a
partition. 8

Thompson on Real Property § 70.09(h) (1994); 8 Powell on
Real Property ch. 56 ¶ 643 (1998).

Concurrent and Marital Estates

Property can be divided and shared among multiple
simultaneous owners. This gives rise to divisions in two dimensions:
“horizontal”

divisions over time and “vertical” divisions at any given
moment in time. The two types of division can be combined: Each of the estates
in land

defined in terms of temporal duration—fee simple, life
estate, remainder, etc.—can also be divided among concurrent owners. Thus, one
can

create concurrent ownership in a fee simple, concurrent life
estates (lasting until the last life tenant dies), and concurrent remainders or
executory

interests.

Some forms of co-ownership shade off into entity law,
considered in Chapter VI. At one time, property could be owned by tenancy in

partnership, in which the legal title to property was
concurrently held by each of the partners. Today, most states provide by
statute that the

partnership as an entity holds title to the property, much
the way corporations as entities hold title to property. Under this entity
theory, there is

only one owner of the property—the entity (partnership or
corporation)—and issues about who manages and controls the property are
resolved as

a matter of partnership or corporation law, not property
law. Nevertheless, keep in mind that forming a trust, partnership, or
corporation is an

alternative to the co-ownership arrangements considered
here. For example, if A, B, and C want to share ownership of a summer cottage,
they

could either hold title to the cottage as concurrent owners,
or they could form a partnership or corporation which would then hold title to
the

cottage.

The main forms of co-ownership today are the tenancy in
common and the joint tenancy. Some states also have an older marital property

arrangement, called the tenancy by the entirety, which is
like the joint tenancy but more durable. All of the arrangements involve an
equal right to

possess whenever the interest in question is possessory. Not
surprisingly and as we will see, this can lead to conflict.

Tenancy in Common. Each tenant in common has a separate but
undivided interest. Each interest is separate , in the sense that it is

independently descendible, conveyable, and devisable. Since
either tenant can unilaterally convey her interest to a third party, property
held

#599

as tenancy in common can be attached by creditors of each
individual tenant. And since each share is independently descendible, there is
no right

of survivorship (as there would be in a joint tenancy, to
which we turn next); the share of each tenant in common passes upon death as
part of his

or her separate estate. Yet each interest in undivided , in
the sense that each tenant in common has the right to possess the whole of the
property

(although they need not exercise that right). Moreover,
there is no requirement that each cotenant hold an equal share. One can create
a tenancy

in common in which A owns a 60 percent interest, B a 30
percent interest, and C a 10 percent interest. Each tenant in such a tenancy in
common

has an equal right to possess the whole, but their
respective share of rents or profits (or their respective obligations to
contribute to the payment

of taxes or mortgage obligations) will be determined by
their respective percentage ownership.

Joint Tenancy. The joint tenancy is exactly like the tenancy
in common, except for the treatment of survivorship. As in the tenancy in

common, each joint tenant has a separate and undivided
interest. Because the interest is undivided, each joint tenant has the right to
possess the

whole. The principal difference is that in a joint tenancy,
a surviving joint tenant automatically acquires the interest of another joint
tenant when

the other tenant dies. Technically nothing passes; the
deceased joint tenant’s interest is simply extinguished. The joint tenancy
requires four

“unities” at the time of creation:

(i)Time. Each interest must be acquired or vest at the same
time.

(ii)Title. Each must acquire title by the same instrument or
by joint adverse possession, never by intestate succession or other

operation of law.

(iii)Interest. Each must have the same legal interest in the
property, such as fee simple, life estate, lease, etc., although not

necessarily identical fractional shares.

(iv)Possession. Each must have the right to possess the
whole.

By contrast, the only unity required to create a tenancy in
common is that of possession.

Traditionally, if any of the unities is destroyed in a joint
tenancy, then we say the joint tenancy is severed and a tenancy in common is

created. Each joint tenant while alive has the power
unilaterally to transfer his or her interest, and thus each may have his or her
interest attached

by creditors. When such a transfer or attachment occurs,
this may have the effect of severing the unities (which ones?) and may convert
the joint

tenancy into a tenancy in common. In this sense, a joint
tenancy comes with a partial exit right (through the possibility of severance),
to

supplement the more radical break up that can be achieved
through partition. (For more on severance, see Harms v. Sprague , infra.) The
joint

#600

tenancy is only appropriate for an intimate relationship
such as a committed relationship or family business.

Tenancy by the Entirety. Roughly half the states have
retained the tenancy by the entirety, which is only available for married
couples.

Like the tenancy in common and the joint tenancy, each
co-owner has a separate and undivided interest, and each has the right to
possession of

the whole. Like the joint tenancy, there is a right of
survivorship. But in some states that recognize the tenancy by the entirety,
neither spouse can

unilaterally transfer or encumber their share of the
property without the consent of the other. See United States v. Craft, 535 U.S.
274 (2002)

(discussing the law of one such state, Michigan, but
declining to insulate property held in tenancy by the entirety from federal
taxes owed by one

spouse). In all states that recognize this tenancy, there is
no unilateral exit option as long as the couple stays married. Both spouses can
convey to

a third person (a “straw”) and then have the straw convey
back to them as tenants in common, but neither spouse acting unilaterally can
sever the

tenancy, other than by getting a divorce. Thus, to the four
unities required by the joint tenancy, a fifth, marriage, is added.

How do we know which type of concurrent tenancy is created
when multiple persons acquire title to property, as when O conveys Blackacre

“to A and B” or when O devises Blackacre by will “to my
Children, C, D, and E”? At common law, a joint tenancy was presumed in any

conveyance that satisfied the four unities (time, title,
interest, and possession). A tenancy by the entirety was presumed in any
conveyance that

satisfied the five unities (time, title, interest,
possession, and marriage). Today, a tenancy in common is generally presumed
unless there is some

other manifestation of intent to create a joint tenancy or a
tenancy by the entirety. Thus, if O conveys “to A and B” this will generally be

presumed to be a tenancy in common. O would have to say
something like “to A and B as joint tenants with right of survivorship and not
as

tenants in common” to be sure to create a joint tenancy.
Similarly one would have to specify “to A and B as tenants by the entirety”
(and A and B

would have to be married) to create a tenancy by the
entirety. Nevertheless, some courts still presume a joint tenancy is intended
in the case of an

ambiguous transfer to a married couple, and courts in some
states that recognize the tenancy by the entirety will presume that this is
intended in

the case of an ambiguous transfer to a married couple, at
least for interests in land.

How do potential co-owners choose which arrangement suits
them best? Many factors may influence this decision. First, the survivorship

feature in the joint tenancy or the tenancy by the entirety
allows a remaining owner to avoid probate (which is costly, cumbersome, and
time-

consuming). The survivor can sell the property immediately
if he or she so chooses. Second, depending on the rules in place in a given
state, the

joint tenancy (and even more so the tenancy by the entirety)
may afford some protection of jointly owned assets from creditors of one of the

#601

co-owners. Finally, tax considerations may come into play.
However, in the federal income tax, joint filing by married couples generally
makes

the form of ownership irrelevant for income tax purposes.

As we will see, the types of concurrent ownership
arrangements are limited in number and have many mandatory features.
Nevertheless,

concurrent ownership has become somewhat more customizable
in recent times. See, e.g., Jezo v. Jezo, 127 N.W.2d 246 (Wis. 1964) (holding

that the presumption that joint tenants own equal shares is
subject to rebuttal by evidence of contrary intent). Also, to the extent that
partnership

and other entity forms are a substitute for direct
concurrent ownership of assets, it is worth noting that entity forms have a
greater and increasing

degree of customizability relative to the traditional forms
of concurrent ownership.

Community Property. Some states of the South and West,
especially those that have some Spanish or French law in their early histories,

feature community property for married couples. Under
community property, all property acquired during the marriage (except in some
states for

gifts and bequests to one spouse) automatically becomes
community property. Each spouse has a right to possess community property, but

typically any alienation or encumbrance must have the
consent of both spouses. Couples can transmute property from separate property
to

community property and vice versa, but there are often
strong presumptions and formalities to overcome in order to prove that what
would

otherwise be community property is separate. Also, property
acquired before the marriage is theoretically separate but may become community

property through commingling with community property. On
divorce, a spouse arguing that property is separate has the burden of proof and
must

be able to trace the property, i.e., to document its
separate existence from community property, through time and possibly various
transactions.

Originally, the community property system gave the husband
sole management and control of the property during marriage. Now both spouses

have such rights, and for certain important transactions to
be valid both spouses must consent. This system never considered the wife’s
legal

personality to merge with that of the husband, as was the
case at common law (but not in equity). On divorce, community property is
subject to

equal division. We return below to the problem of defining
property for purposes of division on divorce in the common-law (i.e., non-

community-property) states.

### 1 .PARTITION

Partition is the most important legal remedy available to
concurrent owners. Any cotenant can sue for partition for any reason or no
reason

at all, and the court will grant the request without further
inquiry into the justness or reasonableness of the request. This in effect
gives each

cotenant an automatic right to terminate the cotenancy at
any time. Partition is available to tenants in common and joint tenants.
Tenants

#602

by the entirety must either convert the property into a
tenancy in common or joint tenancy by mutual agreement, or sever the unity of
marriage

(by divorce), in order to obtain partition.

#### Delfino v. Vealencis

```



Supreme Court of Connecticut, 1980.



436 A. 2 d 27.



```

■ ARTHUR
H. HEALEY, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE. The central issue in this appeal is whether the
Superior Court properly ordered the sale, pursuant to

General Statutes § 52–500,^1 of property owned by the
plaintiffs and the defendant as tenants in common.

The plaintiffs, Angelo and William Delfino, and the
defendant, Helen C. Vealencis, own, as tenants in common, real property located
in

Bristol, Connecticut. The property consists of an
approximately 20.5 acre parcel of land and the dwelling of the defendant
thereon. The plaintiffs

own an undivided 99/1 44 interest in the property, and the
defendant owns a 45/144 interest. The defendant occupies the dwelling and a
portion of

the land, from which she operates a rubbish and garbage
removal business.^3 Apparently, none of the parties is in actual possession of
the

remainder of the property. The plaintiffs, one of whom is a
residential developer, propose to develop the property, upon partition, into
forty-five

residential building lots.

In 1978, the plaintiffs brought an action in the trial court
seeking a partition of the property by sale with a division of the proceeds
according

to the parties’ respective interests. The defendant moved
for a judgment of in-kind partition^5 and the appointment of a committee to
conduct said

#603

partition. The trial court, after a hearing, concluded that
a partition in kind could not be had without “material injury” to the
respective rights of

the parties, and therefore ordered that the property be sold
at auction by a committee and that the proceeds be paid into the court for
distribution

to the parties.

On appeal, the defendant claims essentially that the trial
court’s conclusion that the parties’ interests would best be served by a
partition by

sale is not supported by the findings of subordinate facts,
and that the court improperly considered certain factors in arriving at that
conclusion.

In addition, the defendant directs a claim of error to the
court’s failure to include in its findings of fact a paragraph of her draft
findings.

General Statutes § 52– 495 authorizes courts of equitable
jurisdiction to order, upon the complaint of any interested person, the
physical

partition of any real estate held by tenants in common, and
to appoint a committee for that purpose.^7 When, however, in the opinion of the
court

a sale of the jointly owned property “will better promote
the interests of the owners,” the court may order such a sale under § 52–500.
See Kaiser

v. Second National Bank, 193 A. 761, 764 (Conn. 1937);
Johnson v. Olmsted, 49 Conn. 509, 517 (1882).

It has long been the policy of this court, as well as other
courts, to favor a partition in kind over a partition by sale. The first
Connecticut

statute that provided for an absolute right to partition by
physical division was enacted in 1720; Statutes, 1796, p. 258; the substance of
which

remains virtually unchanged today. Due to the possible
impracticality of actual division, this state, like others, expanded the right
to partition to

allow a partition by sale under certain circumstances. See
Penfield v. Jarvis, 399 A.2d 1280, 1283 (Conn. 1978); see also Restatement, 2
Property

c. 1 1, pp. 65 8–61. The early decisions of this court that
considered the partition-by-sale statute emphasized that “[t]he statute giving
the power of

sale introduces... no new principles; it provides only for
an emergency, when a division cannot be well made, in any other way. The Earl
of

Clarendon v. Hornby, 1 P.Wms., 446.4 Kent’s Com., 365.”
Richardson v. Monson, 23 Conn. 94, 97 (1854). The court later expressed its
reason

for preferring partition in kind when it stated: “[A] sale
of one’s property without his consent is an extreme exercise of power warranted
only in

clear cases.” Ford v. Kirk, 41 Conn. 9, 12 (1874). Although
under General Statutes § 52–500 a court is no longer required to order a
partition in

kind even in cases of extreme difficulty or hardship; see
Scovil v. Kennedy, 14 Conn. 349, 360–61 (1841); it is clear that a partition by
sale

should be ordered only when two conditions are satisfied:
(1) the physical attributes of the land are such that a partition in kind is
impracticable

or inequitable; Johnson v. Olmsted, supra; and (2) the
interests of the owners would better be promoted by a partition by

#604

sale. Kaiser v. Second National Bank, supra; see Gold v.
Rosenfeld, Conn. (41 Conn.L.J., No. 4, p. 18) (1979). Since our law has for
many years

presumed that a partition in kind would be in the best
interests of the owners, the burden is on the party requesting a partition by
sale to

demonstrate that such a sale would better promote the
owners’ interests.

The defendant claims in effect that the trial court’s
conclusion that the rights of the parties would best be promoted by a judicial
sale is not

supported by the findings of subordinate facts. We agree.

Under the test set out above, the court must first consider
the practicability of physically partitioning the property in question. The
trial court

concluded that due to the situation and location of the
parcel of land, the size and area of the property, the physical structure and
appurtenances

on the property, and other factors,^11 a physical partition
of the property would not be feasible. An examination of the subordinate
findings of

facts and the exhibits, however, demonstrates that the court
erred in this respect.

It is undisputed that the property in question consists of
one 20.5 acre parcel, basically rectangular in shape, and one dwelling, located
at the

extreme western end of the property. Two roads, Dino Road
and Lucien Court, abut the property and another, Birch Street, provides access

through use of a right-of-way. Unlike cases where there are
numerous fractional owners of the property to be partitioned, and the
practicability of

a physical division is therefore drastically reduced * * *
in this case there are only two competing ownership interests: the plaintiffs’
undivided

99/144 interest and the defendant’s 45/144 interest. These
facts, taken together, do not support the trial court’s conclusion that a
physical partition

of the property would not be “feasible” in this case.
Instead, the above facts demonstrate that the opposite is true: a partition in
kind clearly

would be practicable under the circumstances of this case.

Although a partition in kind is physically practicable, it
remains to be considered whether a partition in kind would also promote the
best

interests of the parties. In order to resolve this issue,
the consequences of a partition in kind must be compared with those of a
partition by sale.

The trial court concluded that a partition in kind could not
be had without great prejudice to the parties since the continuation of the

defendant’s business would hinder or preclude the
development of the plaintiffs’ parcel for residential purposes, which the trial
court concluded

was the highest and best use of the property. The court’s
concern over the possible adverse economic effect upon the plaintiffs’ interest
in the

event of a partition in kind was based essentially on four
findings: (1) approval by the city planning commission for subdivision of the
parcel

would be

#605

difficult to obtain if the defendant continued her garbage
hauling business; (2) lots in a residential subdivision might not sell, or
might sell at a

lower price, if the defendant’s business continued; (3) if
the defendant were granted the one-acre parcel, on which her residence is
situated and on

which her business now operates, three of the lots proposed
in the plaintiffs’ plan to subdivide the property would have to be consolidated
and

would be lost; and (4) the proposed extension of one of the
neighboring roads would have to be rerouted through one of the proposed
building

lots if a partition in kind were ordered. The trial court
also found that the defendant’s use of the portion of the property that she
occupies is in

violation of existing zoning regulations. The court
presumably inferred from this finding that it is not likely that the defendant
will be able to

continue her rubbish hauling operations from this property
in the future. The court also premised its forecast that the planning
commission would

reject the plaintiffs’ subdivision plan for the remainder of
the property on the finding that the defendant’s use was invalid. These factors
basically

led the trial court to conclude that the interests of the
parties would best be protected if the land were sold as a unified unit for
residential

subdivision development and the proceeds of such a sale were
distributed to the parties. * * *

[A]ny inference that the defendant would probably be unable
to continue her rubbish hauling activity on the property in the future is

unfounded. We also conclude that the court erred in
concluding that the city’s planning commission would probably not approve a
subdivision

plan relating to the remainder of the property. Any such
forecast must be carefully scrutinized as it is difficult to project what a
public body will

decide in any given matter. See Rushchak v. West Haven, 356
A.2d 104, 107 (Conn. 1975). In this case, there was no substantial evidence to

support a conclusion that it was reasonably probable that
the planning commission would not approve a subdivision plan for the remainder
of the

property. Cf. Budney v. Ives, 239 A.2d 482, 485 (Conn.
1968). Moreover, there is no suggestion in the statute relating to subdivision
approval;

see General Statutes § 8–25; that the undeveloped portion of
the parcel in issue, which is located in a residential neighborhood, could not
be the

subject of an approved subdivision plan notwithstanding the
nearby operation of the defendant’s business. The court’s finding indicates
that only

garbage trucks and dumpsters are stored on the property;
that no garbage is brought there; and that the defendant’s business operations
involve

“mostly containerized... dumpsters, a contemporary
development in technology which has substantially reduced the odors previously

associated with the rubbish and garbage hauling industry.”
These facts do not support the court’s speculation that the city’s planning
commission

would not approve a subdivision permit for the undeveloped
portion of the parties’ property.

The court’s remaining observations relating to the effect of
the defendant’s business on the probable fair market value of the proposed

residential lots, the possible loss of building lots to
accommodate the

#606

defendant’s business and the rerouting of a proposed
subdivision road, which may have some validity, are not dispositive of the
issue. It is the

interests of all of the tenants in common that the court
must consider; see Lyon v. Wilcox, 119 A. 361, 362–63 (Conn. 1923); 59
Am.Jur.2d,

Partition § 1 18, p. 865; and not merely the economic gain
of one tenant, or a group of tenants. The trial court failed to give due
consideration to

the fact that one of the tenants in common has been in
actual and exclusive possession of a portion of the property for a substantial
period of

time; that the tenant has made her home on the property; and
that she derives her livelihood from the operation of a business on this
portion of

the property, as her family before her has for many years. A
partition by sale would force the defendant to surrender her home and, perhaps,

would jeopardize her livelihood. It is under just such
circumstances, which include the demonstrated practicability of a physical
division of the

property, that the wisdom of the law’s preference for
partition in kind is evident.

As this court has many times stated, conclusions that
violate “law, logic or reason or are inconsistent with the subordinate facts”
cannot

stand. Russo v. East Hartford, 425 A.2d 1282, 1284 (Conn.
1979); Connecticut Coke Co. v. New Haven, 364 A.2d 178, 185 (Conn. 1975). Since

the property in this case may practicably be physically
divided, and since the interests of all owners will better be promoted if a
partition in kind

is ordered, we conclude that the trial court erred in
ordering a partition by sale, and that, under the facts as found, the defendant
is entitled to a

partition of the property in kind.

There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is
remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .On remand, the court awarded Helen Vealencis
approximately one acre, including the family homestead and dumpster operation,
in the middle

of the west end of the 20. 5 acre plot (see Figure 5 - 10 ).
The brothers were awarded the rest of the land, which they sold to a developer
for $ 725 , 000 , laid

out in a plat of 42 lots. Based on this price, the market
value of the land awarded to Helen was about $ 72 , 000. Helen’s acreage was
separated from the

new subdivision by a two-foot strip of land, running from
lot 39 down to lot 40 , which deprived her of any access to Dino Road in the
subdivision. (Her

only public access was to Birch Road, via lot 9 C.) In
addition, the court required Helen to make a payment of $ 26 , 000 to the
brothers to compensate

them for the adverse effect of the garbage dumpster
operation on the value of the subdivision. (Such a payment to correct
imbalances in a partition in

kind is called _owelty_ .) So the final value of the award
to Helen, in monetary terms, was $ 46 , 000 ; the brothers got $ 362 , 500
each. See Manel Baucells &

Steven A. Lippman, Justice Delayed is Justice Denied: A
Cooperative Game Theoretic Analysis of Hold-Up in Co-Ownership, 22 Cardozo L.
Rev.

1191 , 1220 – 43 ( 2001 ). Did the trial judge (who had
originally ordered a partition sale, only to be reversed by the Connecticut
Supreme Court) treat

fairly? Would she have been better off capitulating to the
brothers at the outset and foregoing litigation?

2 .In theory, one co-owner can always buy out the other
co-owners. What types of transaction costs are likely to impede some such
sales? Why do

you think bargaining broke down in _Delfino_ , despite the
surplus on the table?

3 .Not all courts are as seemingly protective of the
subjective value of one co-owner as the Connecticut Supreme Court in _Delfino_.
Compare

Johnson v. Hendrickson, 24 N.W. 2 d 914 (S.D. 1946 )
(ordering partition by sale despite some cotenants having a homestead on part
of the property and a

farm across the road from the homestead). Despite the
traditional preference for partition in kind, courts have increasingly favored
partition

```



608



```

by sale. In a partition in kind, courts will try if possible
to allow a cotenant living on the parcel to keep the portion on which she
lives. See, e.g.,

Anderson v. Anderson, 560 N.W. 2 d 729 (Minn. Ct. App. 1997
).

4 .Partition affords each co-owner an avenue for _exit_ ,
and the threat of exit can help a co-owner protect her interests. Her dealings
with the co-

owners occur under the shadow of the exit option. Another
strategy for exercising leverage without exit is _voice_ , expressing
dissatisfaction and agitating

for change within the group or organization. See Albert O.
Hirschman, Exit, Voice, and Loyalty: Responses to Decline in Firms,
Organizations and

States ( 1970 ). A third strategy identified by Hirschman,
_loyalty_ , leads participants to avoid leaving and to leave quietly when they
do. Hirschman

explores the complex relationship between exit, voice, and
loyalty and the circumstances under which each has advantages and where the two
strategies

of exit and voice reinforce or undermine each other. Exit
places at least one co-owner on the “outside” of the property along with other
dutyholders who

must respect the exclusion rights of the owner. Voice can be
exercised in more or less formal ways within the structure of governance rules
over uses of

the resource. In the next Chapter we take up condominiums
and cooperatives, where these mechanisms are often explicitly incorporated into
the bylaws

of the relevant community. The notions of exit and voice
have been applied to a wide range of public, commercial, and private
organizations and groups.

5 .Partition by sale can cause a cash-strapped co-owner to
lose subjective value. This is particularly likely in cases in which one of the
co-owners

is actually living on the property. Some have argued that
the law of partition is to blame for the decline in African-American farming
since the late

nineteenth century, because African-Americans were less
likely to have wills and land ownership passing by intestacy became fragmented
among an

ever-increasing number of descendants of the original owner.
From 1920 to 1978 , the number of farms operated by African-Americans declined
94 %,

from 925 , 710 to 57 , 271 (in the same period farms
operated by whites declined 56 %, from about 5. 4 million to about 2. 4
million). U.S. Comm’n on Civil

Rights, The Decline of Black Farming in America 2 – 3 ( 1982
). For discussion see, e.g., John G. Casagrande Jr., Acquiring Property Through
Forced

Partitioning Sales: Abuses And Remedies, 27 B.C. L. Rev. 755
( 1986 ); Thomas W. Mitchell, From Reconstruction to Deconstruction:
Undermining

Black Landownership, Political Independence, and Community
Through Partition Sales of Tenancies in Common, 95 Nw. U. L. Rev. 505 ( 2001 );
see

also Hanoch Dagan & Michael A. Heller, The Liberal
Commons, 110 Yale L.J. 549 , 602 – 09 ( 2001 ) (presenting partition sales
involving African-

American farmers as an example to suggest problems with
partition). Other possible causes operating at various times include Jim Crow
era

discrimination in land markets for prime parcels, unequal
access to credit and government programs, and the general decline of the family
farm (the

latter assisted by agricultural subsidies and other programs
favoring large farms). For a recapitulation of evidence, see Thomas W. Mitchell
et al., Forced

Sale Risk: Class, Race, and the “Double Discount”, 37 Fla.
St. U. L. Rev. 589 , 610 – 19 ( 2010 ). In 2010 , the Uniform Law Commission
adopted a

```



609



```

Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act, which affords a
range of due process protections for heirs to protect them against unfair
forced sales in

partition. As of late 2021 , the UPHPA has been adopted by
18 states.

6 .Would co-owners be better off if exit options were more
limited? Some commentators have argued for an approach more like that in
civil-law

countries, which permit a greater degree of judicial
intervention into co-owner relations, with a corresponding de-emphasis on easy
partition; this, it has

been suggested, might foster more communitarian relations.
See Dagan & Heller, supra. But note that cotenants can agree by contract
not to partition or

can agree to limit the reasons for partition. Such contracts
will be enforced, provided they are not an unreasonable restraint on
alienation. See, e.g.,

Michalski v. Michalski, 142 A. 2 d 645 (N.J. Super. Ct. App.
Div. 1958 ). Also, those who want to provide for a more tailored relationship
can form a

partnership or a corporation to own the property, with
provisions structuring their use of the property incorporated into the
partnership agreement or the

bylaws of the corporation. Do these sources of flexibility
suggest that there is no need to modify the automatic exit right given by the
common law?

### 2 .CONTRIBUTION AND ACCOUNTING

The law does provide some limited regulations of inputs and
outputs as between co-owners. The degree to which courts will get involved is

low when the parties continue in an ongoing relationship,
but increases when one party seeks partition, or, as in the following case,
when one

party has “ousted” the other from possession.

#### Gillmor v. Gillmor

```



Supreme Court of Utah, 1984.



694 P. 2 d 1037.



```

■
STEWART, JUSTICE: The defendant Edward Leslie Gillmor appeals from a $29,760
judgment awarded to Florence Gillmor, a cotenant, because

defendant obstructed her from exercising her right to occupy
land in which she owned an undivided interest with the defendant and C. Frank

Gillmor. The property is made up of several large parcels
amounting to some 33,000 acres located in Summit, Tooele, and Salt Lake
counties.

Two brothers, the parties’ fathers, Frank and Edward Lincoln
Gillmor, had owned the land and used it for their ranching business. Upon the

death of Frank Gillmor, his one-half interest in the
property passed in equal shares to his sons, the defendant and C. Frank
Gillmor. Edward

Lincoln Gillmor continued the ranching business, and for
several years grazed cattle and sheep on portions of the common properties.
Upon the

death of Edward Lincoln Gillmor, his one-half interest
passed to his daughter, the plaintiff Florence Gillmor, and she, C. Frank, and
the

defendant became tenants in common.

#610

In May 1979, the plaintiff filed the instant suit for an
accounting and damages for the defendant’s exclusive use of the property since

January 1, 1979. She also filed a separate suit for
partition of the common properties.

The trial was divided into two phases to determine first the
damages from January 1, 1979, to May 31, 1980, and second the damages from

June 1 , 1980, to December 31, 1980. The trial court held
that from January 1, 1979, to May 31, 1980, the defendant had grazed livestock
on the

common properties in such a manner as to constitute
exclusive use of the properties and thereby exclude the plaintiff from grazing
her livestock

on those properties. The trial court awarded a $21,544.91
judgment for one-half the rental value of the properties in favor of Florence
Gillmor

and against defendant. Defendant did not appeal that
decision.

In the second phase of the trial, the trial court found that
“[b]etween June 1, 1980 and December 31, 1980, defendant Edward Gillmor

continued to graze his sheep and cattle on the common
properties in Salt Lake and Summit counties or to use said lands to produce
feed for his

cattle and sheep, and such use... was to the exclusion of
the plaintiff.”

On appeal, the defendant argues with respect to the second
judgment (1) that “there is no evidence or finding on the issue of ouster,” and
(2)

that even if there were an ouster, the damages are
excessive.

I.

The law is that a cotenant may sue for his share of rents
and profits from common property if he has been ousted from possession of the

common property. Roberts v. Roberts, 584 P.2d 378, 380 (Utah
1978). The defendant argues that the trial court did not find that the
defendant

ousted the plaintiff. The trial court did not specifically
use that term in its findings of fact and conclusions of law, but it did find
that the

defendant had both exercised exclusive use and possession
and had also excluded the plaintiff from use of the common properties.

Mere exclusive use of commonly held properties by one
cotenant is not sufficient to establish an ouster. A tenant in common has the
right to

use and occupy the entire property held in cotenancy without
liability to other cotenants. Each cotenant has the right to “free and
unobstructed

possession... without liability for rents for the use and
occupation thereof.” Utah Oil Refining Co. v. Leigh, 96 P.2d 1100, 1102 (Utah
1939).

That one cotenant is not liable to his cotenant for rents
for the occupancy of the common property is elemental. And this is true even

though [the cotenant] uses it and derives income therefrom,
as where he occupies... or farms a piece and takes the crops; or uses it for

storage purposes; as long as he does not interfere with the
cotenant’s right to likewise occupy, use and enjoy.

96 P.2d at 1103 (citations omitted).

#611

However, a cotenant who ousts another cotenant or acts in
such a fashion as to necessarily exclude a fellow cotenant, violates the rights
of

that cotenant. Roberts v. Roberts, 584 P.2d at 380; Utah Oil
Refining v. Leigh, 96 P.2d at 1 103. To establish a right to share in the rents
and

profits from the common property, it must be established
that a cotenant has used the property so as to “necessarily exclude his
cotenant.” Utah

Oil Refining Co., 96 P.2d at 1103.

Exclusive use means more than one cotenant using the entire
property; it requires either an act of exclusion or use of such a nature that
it

necessarily prevents another cotenant from exercising his
rights in the property.^2 Roberts v. Roberts, 584 P.2d at 380–81; Utah Oil
Refinery Co.

v. Leigh, 96 P.2d at 1103. * * *

The defendant contends that the trial court erred in finding
that the defendant had exercised exclusive possession and use of the common

properties in such a manner as to exclude the plaintiff from
using the land. We disagree. The plaintiff sought to graze livestock on the
land to the

extent of her interest, but was effectively prevented from
doing so. She sent defendant a letter expressing her intent to graze her
livestock on the

properties in proportion to her ownership and requested that
the defendant accommodate her plans by altering his operations accordingly. The

defendant refused to respond and continued to graze the
lands to their maximum capacity. He even acknowledged that additional grazing
would

have damaged the range land. The defendant asserts that at
various times he or his attorney invited the plaintiff onto the lands, but he
never

indicated any intention to alter his operations so as to
accommodate the plaintiff’s use of the land. Had the plaintiff grazed her
livestock on the

common properties while defendant’s livestock was also
there, the land would have been overgrazed. Indeed, the defendant admitted that
if the

plaintiff had attempted to put additional sheep on the land,
he would have sought an injunction to prevent damage to the land.

We hold that when a cotenant out of possession makes a
clear, unequivocal demand to use land that is in the exclusive possession of
another

cotenant, and that cotenant refuses to accommodate the other
tenant’s right to use the land, the tenant out of possession has established a
claim

for relief. It is not necessary that the out-of-possession
cotenant resort to force or to means that would damage the common property to
establish

a right to legal redress.

II.

The defendant argues that the damage award of $29,760 for
seven months of grazing is excessive when contrasted with the award of

$21,544.91 in the first phase of trial for seventeen months
of grazing. * * * [The court went on to uphold the damages award.]

#612

The defendant also argues that the damages should not have
been awarded for the time when he herded his livestock from one parcel of

Gillmor land to another over land owned by a third party
pursuant to trail or trespass rights, which include grazing along the way. See
generally

Anderson v. Osguthorpe, 504 P.2d 1000 (Utah 1972). Since the
trail rights are appurtenant to the Gillmor land, there is no sound reason for

distinguishing between them and the rights to the fee land.

---

The defendant also argues that he is entitled to an offset
for repairs made on the common property. Sometime after June 1, 1980, he
repaired

a range fence and a ditch on the common property. He asserts
that the fence repairs directly benefited the plaintiff because she now owns
land

which borders the fence.

Where a cotenant in sole possession makes repairs or
improvements to the common property without the consent of his fellow
cotenants, he

generally has no right of contribution. In Heiselt v.
Heiselt , 349 P.2d 175, 178–79 (Utah 1960) (quoting 14 Am.Jur. Cotenancy § 49
at 115

(1938)), we stated:

While contrary doctrines have been enunciated and the
question is conceded to be one of great difficulty, it appears to be generally

agreed that a cotenant who has made improvements upon the
common property without the assent of his cotenants is not ordinarily

entitled to contribution and cannot, as a matter of right,
charge them with the value or costs thereof or maintain any action that would

result in a personal judgment against them. * * *
Compensation for improvements is allowed, however, where the other cotenants
have

stood by and permitted him to proceed to his detriment.

A cotenant may, however, be required to contribute his pro
rata share of expenses if the cotenant in possession acted in good faith, with
the

bona fide belief that he was the sole owner of the property,
or when the repairs were essential to preserve or protect the common estate.
See

Zanzonico v. Zanzonico, 2 A.2d 597 (N.J. Eq. 1938); 20
Am.Jur.2d Cotenancy and Joint Ownership § 62 (1965). Furthermore, where, as
here, a

cotenant out of possession seeks an accounting or damages,
the cotenant in possession, who is held liable for the value of the use,
occupancy, or

rents collected, is entitled to recover reasonable
expenditures made by him for necessary repairs and maintenance.^4 * * *

In the instant case, the evidence indicates that the repairs
were a necessary cost of grazing the livestock and should have been deducted
from

the damages awarded. The case must therefore be remanded for
a modification of the judgment. * * *

#613

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The right of a cotenant to obtain rental payments from
another cotenant depends critically on whether the rental payments are based on
a rental

to a third party or are based on the rental value of the
possession to an occupying cotenant. If one cotenant rents to a third party,
then the renting cotenant

is obliged to share the payments with other cotenants. In
these circumstances the non-renting cotenant can bring an action for an
accounting, and the

court will apportion the rents in accordance with ownership
shares. In contrast, there is in general no obligation for one cotenant to pay
rent to other

cotenants for the value of their possession. The exception
is where the cotenant out of possession can prove an ouster. As to what
constitutes an ouster,

the cases are all over the lot. On the variety of approaches
courts have taken, see Evelyn Alicia Lewis, Struggling with Quicksand: The Ins
and Outs of

Cotenant Possession Value Liability and a Call for Default
Rule Reform, 1994 Wis. L. Rev. 331. Acts of physical exclusion from the whole
property are

sufficient for ouster. But a letter telling a cotenant to
vacate or pay rent may or may not be enough. What were the critical facts in
_Gillmor_ that led the

court to find an ouster?

2 .The requirement of complete ouster is sometimes “derived”
from the unity of possession (each cotenant has the right to use and possess
the

whole) that is characteristic of the tenancy in common and
other co-ownership arrangements. Is there any other reason? Some contracts
scholars have

invoked the difference between relatively hard-edged norms
appropriate for endgame situations, and more accommodating “relationship
preserving”

norms often based on reciprocal trust. Enforcing
relationship-preserving norms in an endgame scenario might undermine them. See
Lisa Bernstein,

Merchant Law in a Merchant Court: Rethinking the Code’s
Search for Immanent Business Norms, 144 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1765 ( 1996 ). Might
something

like this be going on here? As long as the relationship is
continuing, should courts adjudicate who washes the car or mops the floor?

3 .Once there is an ouster, the clock may also start ticking
on adverse possession. As mentioned in Note 2 in the _Gillmor_ case, the
standard for

ouster in the context of adverse possession is more
stringent than for purposes of contribution and accounting. Illustrative of the
difficulties is _McAllister

v. Norville_ , 514 So. 2 d 1270 (Ala. 1987 ), in which 14
boat pilots acquired property along Alabama’s Gulf coast in 1872 as tenants in
common but with an

informal right as amongst themselves to “stake a claim” to a
portion of the property and build a house on it. Over 100 years later the
successors to the

original pilots disputed title to parts of “Pilot Town.” In
a quiet title action, the trial court found an ouster for purposes of adverse
possession, but the

Supreme Court of Alabama reversed, holding that because the
original pilots had wished to establish a selective community in which each
owner would

have an undivided one-fourteenth interest, the cotenants’
acts of possession were permissive.

4 .Whether courts will adjudicate claims by a cotenant for
reimbursement from other cotenants also depends on whether the relationship is
ongoing

or has been terminated. If the relationship is ongoing,

```



614



```

a cotenant can sue for contribution for expenditures that
are necessary to preserve the property from being taken through forfeiture,
such as the payment

of property taxes or mortgage payments. But contribution is
unlikely to be awarded for repairs and maintenance expenses, and certainly will
not be

awarded for improvements. When the relationship is at an
end, however, either because one cotenant has sued for partition, or as in
_Gillmor_ one cotenant

has proven ouster by another, courts are more willing to
consider offsets for repair and maintenance expenses and may even take
expenditures for

improvements into account. Reimbursement for these
expenditures may be reflected either as offsets from imputed rental payments
(as in _Gillmor_ ) or

may be awarded as owelty in a partition action.

### 3 .SEVERANCE

The difference between a joint tenancy and tenancy in common
is the right of survivorship. But either joint tenant can unilaterally “sever”

the joint tenancy, which destroys the right of survivorship
and converts the tenancy into a tenancy in common.

What actions lead to a severance? At common law, severance
required the destruction of one of the four unities (time, title, interest, and

possession). This was usually achieved through a conveyance
to a third party (strawman or straw) who would then reconvey to the grantor.
These

days one can probably convey to oneself and effect a
severance of the joint tenancy. Questions also arise as to whether a unilateral
lease by one

joint tenant, or as in the following case a unilateral
mortgage, severs a joint tenancy.

#### Harms v. Sprague

```



Supreme Court of Illinois, 1984.



473 N.E. 2 d 930.



```

■ THOMAS
J. MORAN, JUSTICE. Plaintiff, William H. Harms, filed a complaint to quiet
title and for declaratory judgment in the circuit court of

Greene County. Plaintiff had taken title to certain real
estate with his brother John R. Harms, as a joint tenant, with full right of
survivorship. The

plaintiff named, as a defendant, Charles D. Sprague, the
executor of the estate of John Harms and the devisee of all the real and
personal property

of John Harms. Also named as defendants were Carl T. and
Mary E. Simmons, alleged mortgagees of the property in question. Defendant

Sprague filed a counterclaim against plaintiff, challenging
plaintiff’s claim of ownership of the entire tract of property and asking the
court to

recognize his (Sprague’s) interest as a tenant in common,
subject to a mortgage lien. At issue was the effect the granting of a mortgage
by John

Harms had on the joint tenancy. Also at issue was whether
the mortgage survived the death of John Harms as a lien against the property.

The trial court held that the mortgage given by John Harms
to defendants Carl and Mary Simmons severed the joint tenancy. Further,

#615

the court found that the mortgage survived the death of John
Harms as a lien against the undivided one-half interest in the property which
passed

to Sprague by and through the will of the deceased. The
appellate court reversed, finding that the mortgage given by one joint tenant
of his

interest in the property does not sever the joint tenancy.
Accordingly, the appellate court held that plaintiff, as the surviving joint
tenant, owned

the property in its entirety, unencumbered by the mortgage
lien. * * *

Two issues are raised on appeal: (1) Is a joint tenancy
severed when less than all of the joint tenants mortgage their interest in the
property?

and (2) Does such a mortgage survive the death of the
mortgagor as a lien on the property?

A review of the stipulation of facts reveals the following.
Plaintiff, William Harms, and his brother John Harms, took title to real estate

located in Roodhouse, on June 26, 1973, as joint tenants.
The warranty deed memorializing this transaction was recorded on June 29, 1973,
in

the office of the Greene County recorder of deeds.

Carl and Mary Simmons owned a lot and home in Roodhouse.
Charles Sprague entered into an agreement with the Simmons whereby

Sprague was to purchase their property for $25,000. Sprague
tendered $18,000 in cash and signed a promissory note for the balance of
$7,000.

Because Sprague had no security for the $7,000, he asked his
friend, John Harms, to co-sign the note and give a mortgage on his interest in
the

joint tenancy property. Harms agreed, and on June 12, 1981,
John Harms and Charles Sprague, jointly and severally, executed a promissory
note

for $7,000 payable to Carl and Mary Simmons. The note states
that the principal sum of $7,000 was to be paid from the proceeds of the sale
of

John Harms’ interest in the joint tenancy property, but in
any event no later than six months from the date the note was signed. The note
reflects

that five monthly interest payments had been made, with the
last payment recorded November 6, 1981. In addition, John Harms executed a

mortgage, in favor of the Simmonses, on his undivided
one-half interest in the joint tenancy property, to secure payment of the note.
William

Harms was unaware of the mortgage given by his brother.

John Harms moved from his joint tenancy property to the
Simmons property which had been purchased by Charles Sprague. On December

10, 19 81, John Harms died. By the terms of John Harms’
will, Charles Sprague was the devisee of his entire estate. The mortgage given
by John

Harms to the Simmonses was recorded on December 29, 1981.

Prior to the appellate court decision in the instant case no
court of this State had directly addressed the principal question we are
confronted

with herein—the effect of a mortgage, executed by less than
all of the joint tenants, on the joint tenancy. Nevertheless, there are
numerous cases

which have considered the severance issue in relation to
other circumstances surrounding a joint tenancy. All have necessarily focused
on the

four unities which are fundamental to both the creation and
the perpetuation of the joint tenancy. These are the unities of

#616

interest, title, time, and possession. (Jackson v.
O’Connell, 177 N.E.2d 194 (Ill. 1961); Tindall v. Yeats, 64 N.E.2d 903 (Ill.
1946).) The voluntary

or involuntary destruction of any of the unities by one of
the joint tenants will sever the joint tenancy. Van Antwerp v. Horan, 61 N.E.2d
358 (Ill.

1945).

In a series of cases, this court has considered the effect
that judgment liens upon the interest of one joint tenant have on the stability
of the

joint tenancy. In Peoples Trust & Savings Bank v. Haas ,
160 N.E. 85 (Ill. 1927), the court found that a judgment lien secured against
one joint

tenant did not serve to extinguish the joint tenancy. As
such, the surviving joint tenant “succeeded to the title in fee to the whole of
the land by

operation of law.” 160 N.E. 85.

Citing to Haas for this general proposition, the court in
Van Antwerp v. Horan , 61 N.E.2d 358 (Ill. 19 45), extended the holding in Haas
to

the situation where a levy is made under execution upon the
interest of the debtor joint tenant. The court found that the levy was “not
such an act

as can be said to have the effect of a divestiture of title

* * * [so as to destroy the] identity of interest or of any other unity which
      must occur

before * * * the estate of joint tenancy has been severed
and destroyed.” 61 N.E.2d 358. * * *

Clearly, this court adheres to the rule that a lien on a
joint tenant’s interest in property will not effectuate a severance of the
joint tenancy,

absent the conveyance by a deed following the expiration of
a redemption period. (See Johnson v. Muntz, 4 N.E.2d 826 (Ill. 1936).) It
follows,

therefore, that if Illinois perceives a mortgage as merely a
lien on the mortgagor’s interest in property rather than a conveyance of title
from

mortgagor to mortgagee, the execution of a mortgage by a
joint tenant, on his interest in the property, would not destroy the unity of
title and

sever the joint tenancy.

Early cases in Illinois, however, followed the title theory
of mortgages. In 1900, this court recognized the common law precept that a

mortgage was a conveyance of a legal estate vesting title to
the property in the mortgagee. (Lightcap v. Bradley, 58 N.E. 221 (Ill. 1900).)

Consistent with this title theory of mortgages, therefore,
there are many cases which state, in dicta, that a joint tenancy is severed by
one of the

joint tenants mortgaging his interest to a stranger. Yet
even the early case of Lightcap v. Bradley, cited above, recognized that the
title held by the

mortgagee was for the limited purpose of protecting his
interests. The court went on to say that “the mortgagor is the owner for every
other

purpose and against every other person. The title of the
mortgagee is anomalous, and exists only between him and the mortgagor * * * .”

Lightcap v. Bradley, 58 N.E. 221.

Because our cases had early recognized the unique and narrow
character of the title that passed to a mortgagee under the common law title

theory, it was not a drastic departure when this court
expressly characterized the execution of a mortgage as a mere lien in Kling v.

#617

Ghilarducci , 121 N.E.2d 752 (Ill. 1954). In Kling, the
court was confronted with the question of when a separation of title, necessary
to create an

easement by implication, had occurred. The court found that
title to the property was not separated with the execution of a trust deed but
rather

only upon execution and delivery of a master’s deed. The
court stated:

In some jurisdictions the execution of a mortgage is a
severance, in others, the execution of a mortgage is not a severance. In

Illinois the giving of a mortgage is not a separation of
title, for the holder of the mortgage takes only a lien thereunder. After

foreclosure of a mortgage and until delivery of the master’s
deed under the foreclosure sale, purchaser acquires no title to the land

either legal or equitable. Title to land sold under mortgage
foreclosure remains in the mortgagor or his grantee until the expiration of

the redemption period and conveyance by the master’s deed.

121 N.E.2d 752.

Kling and later cases rejecting the title theory do not
involve the severance of joint tenancies. As such, they have not expressly
disavowed

the dicta of joint tenancy cases which have stated that the
act of mortgaging by one joint tenant results in the severance of the joint
tenancy. We

find, however, that implicit in Kling and our more recent
cases which follow the lien theory of mortgages is the conclusion that a joint
tenancy is

not severed when one joint tenant executes a mortgage on his
interest in the property, since the unity of title has been preserved. As the
appellate

court in the instant case correctly observed: “If giving a
mortgage creates only a lien, then a mortgage should have the same effect on a
joint

tenancy as a lien created in other ways.” Other
jurisdictions following the lien theory of mortgages have reached the same
result.

A joint tenancy has been defined as “a present estate in all
the joint tenants, each being seized of the whole * * * .” (Partridge v.
Berliner,

156 N.E. 352 (Ill. 1927).) An inherent feature of the estate
of joint tenancy is the right of survivorship, which is the right of the last
survivor to

take the whole of the estate. Because we find that a
mortgage given by one joint tenant of his interest in the property does not
sever the joint

tenancy, we hold that the plaintiff’s right of survivorship
became operative upon the death of his brother. As such plaintiff is now the
sole owner

of the estate, in its entirety.

Further, we find that the mortgage executed by John Harms
does not survive as a lien on plaintiff’s property. A surviving joint tenant

succeeds to the share of the deceased joint tenant by virtue
of the conveyance which created the joint tenancy, not as the successor of the

deceased. The property right of the mortgaging joint tenant
is extinguished at the moment of his death. While John Harms was alive, the

mortgage existed as a lien on his interest in the joint
tenancy. Upon his death, his interest ceased to exist and along with it the
lien of the

#618

mortgage. Under the circumstances of this case, we would
note that the mortgage given by John Harms to the Simmonses was only valid as

between the original parties during the lifetime of John
Harms since it was unrecorded. (Ill.Rev.Stat.1981, ch. 30, par. 29; 27 Ill.L.
& Prac.

Mortgages sec. 65 (1956).) In addition, recording the
mortgage subsequent to the death of John Harms was a nullity. As we stated
above, John

Harms’ property rights in the joint tenancy were
extinguished when he died. Thus, he no longer had a property interest upon
which the mortgage

lien could attach.

In their petition to supplement defendant Sprague’s petition
for leave to appeal, the Simmonses argue that the application of section 20–19

of the Probate Act of 1975 (Ill.Rev.Stat.1981, ch. 110 1/2,
par. 20–19) to the facts of this case would mandate a finding that their
mortgage on the

subject property remains as a valid encumbrance in the hands
of the surviving joint tenant. Section 20–19 reads in relevant part:

(a)When any real estate or leasehold estate in real estate
subject to an encumbrance, or any beneficial interest under a trust of

real estate or leasehold estate in real estate subject to an
encumbrance, is specifically bequeathed or passes by joint tenancy with right

of survivorship or by the terms of a trust agreement or
other nontestamentary instrument, the legatee, surviving tenant or beneficiary
to

whom the real estate, leasehold estate or beneficial
interest is given or passes, takes it subject to the encumbrance and is not
entitled to

have the indebtedness paid from other real or personal
estate of the decedent.

(Ill.Rev.Stat.1981, ch. 110 1/2, par. 20–19.)

While the Simmonses have maintained from the outset that
their mortgage followed title to the property, they did not raise the
applicability

of section 20–19 of the Probate Act of 1975 at the trial
level, and thus the issue is deemed waived. Moreover, because we have found
that the lien

of mortgage no longer exists against the property, section
20–19 is inapplicable, since plaintiff, as the surviving joint tenant, did not
take the

property subject to an encumbrance.

For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the appellate
court is affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .If the Simmonses had dealt with both the Harms brothers,
then the lien would have been unaffected by John Harms’s death. A financial

institution would likely require both of the joint tenants
to sign, but the Simmonses were not sophisticated lenders. Should the rule be
designed to protect

informal lending, or should those involved in real estate
sales be expected to hire a lawyer? Community property requires both spouses to

```



619



```

consent for any alienation or encumbrance of land held as
community property. See, e.g., La. Civ. Code art. 2347.

2 .Courts are all over the map on the issues raised in
_Harms_. One might think that a court applying the title theory of mortgages
would find

severance. But as the court in Harms notes, the “title” here
came to be viewed as given for limited purposes. Some courts still applying the
title theory

would find no severance by a mortgage given by only one of
the joint tenants. With the lien theory, most courts would hold that the lien
does not survive

the death of the mortgagor joint tenant, but the opposite
result under the lien theory can be reached. See Wilken v. Young, 41 N.E. 68 ,
70 (Ind. 1895 ).

One commentator maintains that the distinction between the
“title theory” and the “lien theory” is very largely a formal one, and it
becomes increasingly

hard to defend it in an era when “the intention of the
parties provides the touchstone for deciding most severance cases.” R.H.
Helmholz, Realism and

Formalism in the Severance of Joint Tenancies, 77 Neb. L.
Rev. 1 , 28 – 29 ( 1998 ) (footnote omitted); see also Wesley A. Sturges &
Samuel O. Clark,

Legal Theory and Real Property Mortgages, 37 Yale L.J. 691 ,
709 ( 1928 ) (arguing that judges invoke title or lien theory “depending upon
[their] sense

of convenience and the matters which stimulate them in the
particular case.”). Should the parties’ intent be the touchstone here? Who else
has an interest

in clarity and simplicity here? Is the Illinois Supreme
Court’s approach in _Harms v. Sprague_ any less formalistic than the approach
condemned by

Helmholz? Should a court balance the hardship to the
mortgagee and the surviving joint tenant on a case-by-case basis?

3 .What if William Harms had died first? If the mortgage
lien did not sever the joint tenancy does this mean that the debt is now
secured by the

entire property?

4 .Although the Simmonses wished to add the argument that
Section 20 – 19 of the Probate Act of 1975 mandates that the lien survive the
death of

John Harms, the court holds that this argument has been
waived. But the court in dictum suggests that the result would be the same even
if this provision

did apply. Do you agree? How could the statute be clearer?
Is the problem that the statute seems to presuppose that an interest “passes”
upon the death

of a joint tenant, whereas the court sees the survivorship
under the joint tenancy as involving no passing of an interest, just the
extinguishment of the

deceased’s interest? Or does the court simply disagree with
the policy chosen by the Illinois legislature?

```



5 .On whether mortgages are liens, the Illinois legislature
later adopted the Illinois Mortgage Foreclosure Law, which defines a “mortgage”
as:



any consensual lien created by a written instrument which
grants or retains an interest in real estate to secure a debt or other
obligation. The



term “mortgage” includes, without limitation... every deed
conveying real estate, although an absolute conveyance in its terms, which
shall



have been intended only as a security in the nature of a
mortgage.



```

```



620



```

735 ILCS 5 / 15 – 1207 (originally enacted on July 1 , 1987
, as amended). How would parties contract around this, by showing a contrary
“intent”? What

about parties with mortgages from before 1987 , in light of
the provision also including within “mortgage” “instruments which would have
been deemed

instruments in the nature of a mortgage prior to the
effective date of this amendatory Act of 1987 ”? Id. § 15 – 1207 (e).

6 .Another question that arises with some regularity is
whether a lease by one joint tenant severs the joint tenancy. Again we find
that courts have

taken conflicting approaches. Compare Tenhet v. Boswell, 554
P. 2 d 330 (Cal. 1976 ) with Alexander v. Boyer, 253 A. 2 d 359 (Md. 1969 ).
Also, courts

will prevent one from profiting, including through
inheritance, from one’s own act of murder. In _Maine Savings Bank v. Bridges_ ,
431 A. 2 d 633 (Me.

1981 ), the court held that when the husband killed his
wife, he severed the joint tenancy and held a one-half interest as a tenant in
common with his

wife’s other heirs.

7 .Not only may the joint tenancy be severed unilaterally,
no notice is required. In _Riddle v. Harmon_ , 162 Cal. Rptr. 530 (Ct. App.
1980 ), a married

couple, Frances and Jack Riddle, owned real estate as joint
tenants. Frances was distressed to learn from her lawyer about the survivorship
feature of the

joint tenancy and wanted to dispose of her share by will. At
common law, to sever the joint tenancy would have required two conveyances,
employing a

straw: The joint tenant desiring severance would convey to
the straw (often someone working in the lawyer’s office) who would then
reconvey back to

the grantor, leaving the erstwhile joint tenants as tenants
in common. In _Riddle_ , Frances Riddle’s attorney prepared a deed in which
Frances granted to

herself an undivided one-half interest in the property and a
will in which she devised her share of the property to another. Twenty days
later she died.

Reversing the trial court, the appellate court held that a
straw is not required to sever a joint tenancy. Do problems remain? Should the
joint tenant be

able to sever unilaterally without giving notice to anyone?
Some statutes (currently including one in California) require recordation to
sever a joint

tenancy in some circumstances. Would this have helped here?
What do you think Frances Riddle would have done with the above-described
documents

if her husband had suddenly predeceased her?

### F. MORE ON MARITAL INTERESTS

Married couples are a special set of co-owners. While a
marriage is ongoing the rules of co-ownership are largely the same for married

people as for co-owners. (The main exception is the tenancy
by the entirety, which is not available to nonmarried co-owners.) Special rules
for

marital interests emerge primarily in the context of divorce
and inheritance. The spousal forced share, see Section C.2 supra, is currently
the

main constraint on testamentary freedom in the interest of a
surviving spouse.

We focus here on the rules for property division on divorce.
These are important in their own right, and because they define each spouse’s

exit option they can be expected to influence relations
within an ongoing marriage. In community property states, the rules for
division on

divorce,

#621

as well as those for descent and concurrent use, are tightly
connected to the definition of this form of co-ownership. In common-law states

(common law for purposes of marital property), division on
divorce is governed by principles of equitable division, to the extent they are
not

displaced by an prenuptial agreement. In recent years,
courts have tended to bring equitable division somewhat closer to the approach
under

community property. One of the central issues in marital
property law is how to define “property” for purposes of division on divorce,
and in

particular how to treat increases in human capital during
the marriage. Is it property, and if so in what sense?

■ MAHER,
PRESIDING JUDGE. The defendant appeals and the plaintiff cross appeals from the
property distribution provisions of a February 3, 1989,

judgment of divorce. The primary issue concerns the
valuation of defendant’s law degree and whether the trial court erred in
finding the law

degree to be a marital asset. We affirm in part and remand.

Plaintiff and defendant were married on August 1 1, 1984. At
the time of their marriage, defendant was employed as a cost accountant and

plaintiff was working as a licensed practical nurse and
attending school in pursuit of an associate’s degree in nursing so that she
could become a

registered nurse. It was the plan of the parties when they
married that defendant would enroll in law school and that plaintiff would
postpone her

schooling and work full-time to support them while defendant
attended school. Accordingly, shortly after the marriage, the parties moved
from

Grand Rapids to the Detroit area, where they stayed from
September 1984 until May 1987 while defendant attended Wayne State University
Law

School. In furtherance of the parties’ plan, plaintiff
obtained a full-time job at an area hospital, earning approximately $53,000
during the period

defendant was in law school. Plaintiff also assumed the
primary responsibility of maintaining the household, doing all cooking and
cleaning, and

running all errands. Though defendant did not work at all
during his first year in law school, he later worked as a law clerk, full-time
during the

summers following his first and second years in law school
and then part-time during his second and part of his third years. In all,
defendant

earned approximately $12,000 from clerking. The parties’
earnings were used primarily for their support, while defendant’s education was

financed mostly through student loans totaling $15,000.

Defendant proved to be a successful law student and wrote
for the school’s law review. After defendant graduated in May 1987, the parties

moved back to the Grand Rapids area, where defendant
accepted a position as an associate attorney with a local law firm at a
starting annual

salary of $41,000. The following September, plaintiff
resumed

#622

classes in pursuit of her associate’s degree in nursing. In
November 1987, however, the parties separated. Despite the separation,
plaintiff

continued her classes and eventually received her
associate’s degree in May 1988, although she had to support herself during that
period by

working full-time at a local hospital.

Plaintiff testified that marital problems developed early in
the marriage. She said defendant would often complain that she was overweight,

saying it embarrassed him, and that he would start many
verbal fights, usually over things that were insignificant. She claimed the
situation got to

the point where her whole life revolved around trying not to
agitate defendant. Defendant testified that he often asked plaintiff to leave,

complained that she was a “fanatic” about cleaning, and
admitted that he once presented her with a list of things for her to remember
to do so that

she wouldn’t “irritate” him. Although defendant agreed that
he was sometimes difficult to live with and that he treated plaintiff badly
from time

to time, he blamed it on the stress of law school. According
to plaintiff, defendant would often apologize the day after a fight, sometimes

verbally and sometimes in a letter. The parties finally
separated on November 7, 1987, after defendant informed plaintiff that he had
met another

woman and had gone out with her a couple of times while
plaintiff was working.

The trial court found that the breakdown of the marriage was
primarily the fault of defendant, and announced it had considered this fact in

its property distribution. After awarding each of the
parties their respective automobiles, the trial court awarded plaintiff
specific household

goods and bank funds totaling $5,000, while awarding
defendant specific goods and funds totaling $3,000. Defendant was also held
solely

responsible for repayment of $14,000 in student loans.
Finally, the trial court determined that defendant’s law degree was a marital
asset subject

to distribution. The court valued the degree at $80,000, and
awarded plaintiff, as her share of the degree, $32,000 on the basis that this
amount

would equalize the parties’ respective distributive shares.
The court ordered this obligation to be paid off in monthly installments of
$371.55 or

more, at seven percent interest, until fully paid. The court
did not award either party alimony.

Defendant now appeals and plaintiff cross appeals as of
right. * * * [D]efendant challenges various aspects of the trial court’s
property

distribution, with his primary objection being the court’s
inclusion of his law degree in the marital estate and the resultant valuation
of that

degree. On cross appeal, plaintiff also challenges the trial
court’s valuation of the law degree, contending that it was low.

The goal of a trial court with respect to the division of
the marital estate is a fair and equitable distribution under all of the
circumstances.

The division is not governed by any rigid rules or
mathematical formula and need not be equal. The primary question is what is
fair. On review,

#623

this Court is required to accept the trial court’s factual
findings unless those findings are clearly erroneous.

I.THE LAW DEGREE

---

In addressing the issue involving defendant’s law degree, we
will begin by first discussing the rationale behind the recognition that a

nonstudent spouse must be compensated whenever a concerted
family effort is involved in obtaining an advanced degree, which discussion
will

include an application of the concept “concerted family
effort” to the facts of the instant case. Secondly, we will discuss what we
believe to be

the appropriate and preferable means of characterizing a
claim for compensation involving an advanced degree. Finally, we will address
the

factors and methods that we believe are relevant in valuing
such a claim upon divorce.

A. The Concerted Family Effort.

As indicated above, an award of compensation to a nonstudent
spouse is premised upon both general notions of “fairness” and the existence

of a “concerted family effort.” The relevancy of fairness is
that, in Michigan, equitable considerations form the underlying basis for
recognizing

a claim for compensation involving an advanced degree, and
that the ultimate goal in every divorce case is to do what is necessary to
accord

complete equity under the facts and circumstances of the
case.

Second, the concept “concerted family effort” stresses the
fact that it is not the existence of an advanced degree itself that gives rise
to an

equitable claim for compensation, but rather the fact of the
degree being the end product of the mutual sacrifice, effort, and contribution
of both

parties as part of a larger, long-range plan intended to
benefit the family as a whole. The concept is premised, in part, on the fact
that the

attainment of an advanced degree is a prolonged undertaking
involving considerable expenditure of time, effort, and money, as well as other

sacrifices. Where such an undertaking is pursued as part of
a concerted family effort, both spouses expect to be compensated for their
respective

sacrifices, efforts, and contributions by eventually sharing
in the fruits of the degree. Where, however, the parties’ relationship ends in
divorce,

such a sharing is impossible. Although the degree holder
will always have the degree to show for the efforts, the nonstudent spouse is
left with

nothing. Therefore, a remedy consistent with fairness and
equity requires that an attempt be made to at least return financially to the
nonstudent

spouse the value of what that spouse contributed toward
attainment of the degree.

Generally, the existence of a concerted family effort will
be reflected in many ways. For instance, it is reflected not only through a
spouse’s

tangible efforts and financial contributions associated with
working and supporting the mate while the mate pursues the advanced degree, but

also through other intangible, nonpecuniary efforts and
contributions,

#624

such as where a spouse increases the share of the daily
tasks, child-rearing responsibilities, or other details of household and family
management

undertaken in order to provide the mate with the necessary
time and energy to study and attend classes. A concerted family effort is also

exemplified by the fact that both spouses typically share in
the emotional and psychological burdens of the educational experience. For the

nonstudent spouse, these burdens may be experienced either
directly, such as through the presence of increased tension within the
household, or

indirectly, such as where the spouse shares vicariously in
the stress of the educational experience. Finally, the attainment of an
advanced degree

during marriage is usually accompanied by considerable
sacrifice on the part of both spouses. For the nonstudent spouse, such
sacrifice may be

reflected by a change in life style during the educational
process, the availability of less time to pursue personal interests, or even a
decision to

either give up or temporarily postpone one’s own educational
or career pursuits as part of the larger, long-range plan designed to benefit
the

family as a whole.

Turning now to the instant case, the facts show that
plaintiff temporarily postponed her pursuit of an associate’s degree in
nursing, moved

with defendant to the Detroit area so that he could attend
law school, and then worked full-time to support herself and defendant while
defendant

attended classes. This was all done as part of a larger plan
to benefit both parties as a whole. Plaintiff, in addition to being the primary
financial

provider while defendant attended school, wherein she
accounted for approximately eighty percent of the parties’ total financial
support, also

bore primary responsibility for the daily household tasks.
Moreover, the stress of the law school experience was certainly experienced by
both

parties, as reflected by the fact that defendant repeatedly
blamed his inappropriate behavior toward plaintiff on the stress of law school,
and by

plaintiff’s testimony explaining that her whole life
revolved around her trying not to agitate defendant.

We conclude, therefore, that defendant’s law degree was
clearly the end product of a concerted family effort giving rise to an
equitable

claim for compensation in favor of plaintiff in recognition
of her unrewarded sacrifices, efforts, and contributions toward attainment of
the

degree.

B. Characterization of a Claim for Compensation Involving an
Advanced Degree.

Despite the common recognition among panels of this Court
that a spouse who did not obtain an advanced degree should be compensated

whenever the degree is the end product of a concerted family
effort, panels are in disagreement over the appropriate manner in which a claim
for

compensation should be considered. While some panels have
characterized an advanced degree as a marital asset subject to property
division,

other panels have held that an advanced degree is more
properly considered as a factor in awarding alimony.

#625

After reviewing the various decisions addressing the issue
and taking into consideration the underlying principles upon which an award of

compensation for an advanced degree is premised, we reject
the view holding that an advanced degree is more properly considered as a
factor in

awarding alimony.

The cases adhering to the alimony view have stated that a
degree is simply not “property” for the reasons expressed in Graham v. Graham,

574 P.2d 75,77 (1978):

An educational degree such as an M.B.A., is simply not
encompassed even by the broad views of the concept of “property.” It

does not have an exchange value or any objective
transferable value on an open market. It is personal to the holder. It
terminates on

death of the holder and is not inheritable. It cannot be
assigned, sold, transferred, conveyed or pledged. An advanced degree is a

cumulative product of many years of previous education,
combined with diligence and hard work. It may not be acquired by the mere

expenditure of money. It is simply an intellectual
achievement that may potentially assist in the future acquisition of property.
In our

view, it has none of the attributes of property in the usual
sense of that term.

In rejecting the alimony approach, we first recognize that
the basic purpose of paying alimony is to assist in the other spouse’s support.

Unlike alimony, however, the principles underlying an award
of compensation based on the attainment of an advanced degree are neither
rooted

in nor based on notions of support. Rather, as noted
previously, entitlement to compensation stems from the recognition that where a
degree is the

end product of a concerted family effort, fairness and
equity will not permit the degree holder to reap the benefits of the degree
without

compensating the other spouse for unrewarded sacrifices,
efforts, and contributions toward attainment of the degree. Thus, where a
concerted

family effort is involved, a spouse’s entitlement to
compensation constitutes a recognized right; it is not dependent upon factors
related to the

need for support. Therefore, we do not find that an award of
alimony is the appropriate means for awarding compensation. * * *

Finally, contrary to the observations in Graham, supra, we
do not believe that the consideration of an advanced degree when making the

property distribution would be improper merely because a
degree cannot be characterized as “property” in the classic sense. Rather, we
agree

with Woodworth v. Woodworth , 337 N.W.2d 332, 335 (Mich. Ct.
App. 1983), that “whether or not an advanced degree can physically or

metaphysically be defined as ‘property’ is beside the point
[;] [c]ourts must instead focus on the most equitable solution to dissolving
the

marriage and dividing among the respective parties what they
have.” Furthermore, as I stated in my concurring opinion in Olah v. Olah , 354

N.W.2d 359, 362 (Mich. Ct. App. 1984): “This is an equitable
distribution

#626

jurisdiction, in which classification of an item as either
property or non-property is not decisive in determining the best division of
the parties’

holdings on divorce.” Finally, in Lewis v. Lewis , 448
N.W.2d 735, 737–38 (Mich. Ct. App. 1989), this Court added: “[T]he fundamental
question

in cases involving advanced degrees is not whether a degree
is property, but rather ‘whether the facts in the case give rise to an
equitable claim

regarding the degree so that a property division can be
considered fair and equitable between the parties.’ ” [Emphasis added.]

We conclude, therefore, that where an advanced degree is the
end product of a concerted family effort, involving the mutual sacrifice,
effort,

and contribution of both spouses, there arises a “marital
asset” subject to distribution, wherein the interest of the nonstudent spouse
consists of an

“equitable claim” regarding the degree.

C. Valuation.

Having found that a marital asset giving rise to an
“equitable claim” subject to distribution exists where an advanced degree is
the end

product of a concerted family effort, we will now discuss
the appropriate factors and considerations relative to an evaluation of such a
claim for

purposes of distributing property.

Woodworth , supra, 337 N.W.2d at 337, discussed two methods
of compensating a nonstudent spouse for an interest in an advanced degree:

(1) awarding a percentage share of the present value of the
future earnings attributable to the degree, or (2) restitution. The first
method focuses

on the degree’s present value by attempting to estimate what
the person holding the degree is likely to make in a particular job market and

subtracting therefrom what that person would probably have
earned without the degree. According to Woodworth , the nonstudent spouse
should

then be awarded a percentage share of this value after
considering (1) the length of the marriage after the degree was obtained, (2)
the sources

and extent of financial support given to the degreeholder
during the years in school, and (3) the overall division of the parties’
marital property.

The second method is less involved, because it focuses on
the cost of obtaining the degree.

In this case, plaintiff presented an expert who, using the
present value method discussed in Woodworth , valued defendant’s law degree at

$230,000. Although defendant did not present his own expert,
he took exception to several of the underlying assumptions employed by
plaintiff’s

expert in his valuation of the degree.^3 Using essentially
the same formula, but with modifications to the underlying assumptions,
defendant

presented his own valuations of $15,000, $46,000, and
$79,500. The trial court ultimately valued defendant’s law degree at $80,000,
and then,

after determining that the remainder of the property

#627

distribution resulted in plaintiff receiving a net amount of
$5,000, but defendant having a deficit of $11,000, awarded plaintiff $32,000 as
her

share of the degree, noting that such an award would
equalize the parties’ respective distributive shares.

It is difficult to tell from the record how the trial court
arrived at its initial $80,000 valuation figure. Further, while we certainly
agree that

plaintiff is entitled to be compensated for her unrewarded
sacrifices, efforts, and contributions toward the attainment of defendant’s law
degree,

our review of the record reveals that the trial court’s
ultimate award of $32,000 failed to account for several relevant and applicable

considerations. Accordingly, we conclude that the
appropriate remedy in this case is to remand to the trial court for revaluation
of plaintiff’s

“equitable claim” in light of this opinion. On remand, we do
not believe that the present value method discussed in Woodworth , and
purportedly

used by plaintiff’s expert, is an appropriate means by which
to evaluate plaintiff’s equitable claim involving the degree. Such a method

emphasizes the notion that a nonstudent spouse possesses
some sort of pecuniary interest in the degree itself. We believe such a notion

misconstrues the underlying premise upon which an award of
compensation involving an advanced degree is based. As we have attempted to

explain throughout this opinion, an award of compensation is
premised upon equitable considerations, wherein the goal is to attempt to

financially return to the nonstudent spouse what that spouse
contributed toward attainment of the degree. Because such an award is not
premised

upon the notion that a nonstudent spouse possesses an
interest in the degree itself, we do not believe the actual value of the degree
is a relevant

consideration. In this respect, we agree with the following
observations made in Krause v. Krause, 441 N.W.2d 66, 72–73 (1989):

[W]e believe that defendant is not entitled to any award
specifically designed to compensate her for a portion of the ‘value’ of

plaintiff’s degree. Rather, we believe that the trial court
may consider defendant’s assistance to plaintiff in determining an appropriate

award....

---

[T]he trial court must keep in mind that it is compensating
defendant for her assistance to plaintiff while he pursued his degree.

Thus, the so-called ‘value’ of the degree or plaintiff’s
potential income to be earned from having the degree is irrelevant to the

analysis. The trial court must focus solely on what is
necessary to compensate defendant for the burdens on her or the sacrifices made

by her so that plaintiff could pursue his degree.

Among the arguments advanced by defendant in support of his
contention that an advanced degree should not be considered when

#628

dividing the marital estate are: (1) that marriage is not a
commercial venture, (2) that the value of an advanced degree cannot be
ascertained with

reasonable certainty, and (3) that consideration of a degree
as part of the property division would be akin to involuntary servitude.
Inherent in

each of these arguments, however, is the notion that a
nonstudent spouse possesses some type of pecuniary interest in a degree or is
entitled to be

compensated for a portion of the so-called “value” of the
degree, views we specifically reject. Again, we emphasize that the focus of an
award

involving an advanced degree is not to reimburse the
nonstudent spouse for “loss of expectations” over what the degree might
potentially have

produced, but to reimburse that spouse for unrewarded
sacrifices, efforts, and contributions toward attainment of the degree on the
ground that it

would be equitable to do so in view of the fact that that
spouse will not be sharing in the fruits of the degree.

This Court, in Krause , supra, 441 N.W.2d at 71–72, quoted
at length from a portion of an opinion by the Appellate Division of the
Superior

Court of New Jersey in Mahoney v. Mahoney , 442 A.2d 1062
(N.J. App. Div. 1982). Among the observations expressed therein, and with which

we find ourselves in agreement, are:

The termination of the marriage represents, if nothing else,
the disappointment of expectations, financial and nonfinancial, which

were hoped to be achieved by and during the continuation of
the relationship. It does not, however, in our view, represent a commercial

investment loss. Recompense for the disappointed
expectations resulting from the failure of the marital entity to survive
cannot,

therefore, be made to the spouses on a strictly commercial
basis....

If the plan fails by reason of the termination of the
marriage, we do not regard the supporting spouse’s consequent loss of

expectations by itself as any more compensable or demanding
of solicitude than the loss of expectations of any other spouse who, in

the hope and anticipation of the endurance of the
relationship and its commitments, has invested a portion of his or her life,
youth,

energy and labor in a failed marriage. [Krause, supra, 441
N.W.2d at 71–72]

In our view, any valuation of a nonstudent spouse’s
equitable claim involving an advanced degree involves a two-step analysis.
First, an

examination of the sacrifices, efforts, and contributions of
the nonstudent spouse toward attainment of the degree. Second, given such
sacrifices,

efforts, and contributions, a determination of what remedy
or means of compensation would most equitably compensate the nonstudent spouse

under the facts of the case. In this regard, we agree with
Woodworth that the length of the marriage after the degree was obtained, the
sources and

extent of financial support given to the degree holder
during the years in school, and the overall division of the parties’ marital
property are all

#629

relevant considerations in valuing a nonstudent spouse’s
equitable claim involving an advanced degree upon divorce.

Where, for instance, the parties remain married for a
substantial period of time after an advanced degree is obtained, fairness
suggests that

the value of an equitable claim would not be as great,
inasmuch as the nonstudent spouse will already have been rewarded, in part, for
efforts

contributed by virtue of having already shared, in part, in
the fruits of the degree. Similarly, where the extent of support or assistance
provided by

the nonstudent spouse, financial or otherwise, is not
significant, or where such assistance comes primarily from outside sources for
which the

nonstudent spouse was not responsible or is not liable,
fairness and equity would also suggest that the value of an equitable claim
would not be as

great.

Furthermore, an equitable remedy may be exemplified in
different ways. For example, as this Court recognized in Krause , supra, 441

N.W.2d at 72: “[I]f [the nonstudent spouse] wishes to pursue
[an] education or take other similar steps to improve... employability or
income

earning potential, it is reasonable and equitable to require
the [degree-holding spouse] to assist... in those endeavors.” Thus, in this
type of

situation, an award consistent with fairness and equity
would be one which requires the degree-earning spouse to provide assistance, in
the form

of financial support, equivalent to that provided by the
nonstudent spouse during the marriage.

Where, however, a nonstudent spouse does not wish to further
pursue an education, then perhaps equity would best be served by an award

reimbursing the spouse for the amount of financial
assistance provided toward attainment of the degree, while also recognizing the
other

intangible, nonpecuniary sacrifices made and efforts
expended.

Ultimately, however, the goal is to arrive at a remedy
which, consistent with fairness and equity, will compensate the nonstudent
spouse for

unrewarded sacrifices, efforts, and contributions toward the
degree. Thus, in reviewing such a claim on appeal, the ultimate inquiry is
whether

the remedy or decision of the trial court was a fair and
equitable one under the facts of the case, given the sacrifices, efforts, and
contributions of

the nonstudent spouse toward the degree.

Affirmed in part and remanded for proceedings consistent
with this opinion regarding the valuation of plaintiff’s equitable claim
involving

defendant’s law degree. We do not retain jurisdiction.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The court stops short of calling the law degree a marital
asset in the full sense of property. Instead, the court invokes the law of
restitution for

unjust enrichment (see Chapter IV). In the law of
restitution one can have an obligation to hand over property; the source of the
obligation can but need

not be a property interest. (Restitution for trespass in an
underground cave

```



630



```

would be property-based, as would restitution for wrongful
use of an egg-washing machine.) But restitution can use other benchmarks, and
here it would

seem to be the disappointed expectations of the non-degree
spouse. The court asserts that the vindication of this expectation requires the
return of the

contributions she made toward the acquisition of the degree.
The award should not include the return on this investment, according to the
court, because

marriage is not a commercial undertaking. Is that right?
Might marriage be both a romantic life commitment and a commercial partnership?
Generally, if

one spouse is to be compensated for investments made in the
other spouse’s human capital, what is the nature of the interest or
expectation? Is the

investment like a loan? Or an equity-like share? See, e.g.,
Daniel D. Polsby & Martin Zelder, Risk-Adjusted Valuation of Professional
Degrees in

Divorce, 23 J. Legal Stud. 273 ( 1994 ); Lloyd Cohen,
Marriage, Divorce, and Quasi Rents; Or, “I Gave Him the Best Years of My Life,”
16 J. Legal

Stud. 267 ( 1987 ).

2 .What role is fault playing in the court’s decision?
Generally speaking, property division is not used to punish either spouse for
behavior during

the marriage and the trend has been towards no-fault
divorce. (Does no-fault divorce improve or weaken the bargaining position of
the more vulnerable

spouse?) The court here acknowledges a role for the
husband’s fault in the property division, which is not typical outside
egregious cases. (Was this

one?) In the law of restitution, courts tend to engage in
more stringent disgorgement in the case of wrongdoing and even trace the
product of wrongfully

taken assets. If wrongdoing is relevant in _Postema v.
Postema_ , why wouldn’t that furnish a basis for transferring gains to the
wife?

3 .The general trend in family law in recent decades has
been to prefer a one-time property division upon divorce and to discourage (or
prohibit)

awards of alimony. Part of the reason for this is to avoid
any presumption that one spouse (traditionally the wife) is dependent on the
other spouse

(traditionally the husband) for support and is incapable of
forging a new life on her own. Another part is to avoid the need for ongoing
supervision by

the court to adjudicate disputes over late or missing
alimony payments, requests for modifications in alimony, and the like. The
trial court here requires

the husband to make monthly payments of $ 371. 55 plus
interest in order to pay off the amount owed to the wife for her efforts to
support him while he

obtained the law degree. The appeals court appears to
contemplate a similar award on remand, given that the couple has insufficient
assets to make a

one-time lump sum settlement. Is this just alimony by
another name? In a state that bars all or most alimony awards, can the
degree-holding spouse

argue that monthly payments are impermissible?

4 .What if the law degree were to be treated as property in
some sense? Some states, most notably New York, experimented for a while with

treating advanced degrees as marital property subject to
equitable division on divorce. See O’Brien v. O’Brien, 489 N.E. 2 d 712 (N.Y.
1985 ). Although at

one time eight states recognized professional degrees as
marital property for at least some purposes, apparently no state currently does
so. Even New

York in 2016 enacted legislation removing enhanced earning
capacity from the category of martial property subject to division, with
enhanced earning

```



631



```

capacity to be considered as a factor in equitable division
of other assets. N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law § 236 (B)( 5 )(d)( 7 ); Elena Karabatos
& Eric A. Tepper,

New York’s Spousal Maintenance Guidelines, 51 Fam. L.Q. 51 ,
70 ( 2017 ). How does this differ from the approach taken in _Postema v.
Postema_? Does

the New York legislation do a better job of protecting the
non-degree spouse’s expectations?

5 .How should the role of innate talent and other variables
be treated? One older New York appellate court case decided that the increase
in the

extraordinary earning potential of an opera singer
attributable in part to the domestic and voice coaching efforts of her husband
was property subject to

division. Elkus v. Elkus, 572 N.Y.S. 2 d 901 (App. Div. 1991
). The court held that “the enhanced skills of an artist such as the plaintiff,
albeit growing

from an innate talent, which have enabled her to become an
exceptional earner, may be valued as marital property subject to equitable
distribution.” 572

N.Y.S. 2 d at 904. Celebrity status is another form of human
capital that can be taken into account in divorce as marital property subject
to equitable

distribution, and was so treated at one time in New York and
New Jersey. See Piscopo v. Piscopo, 555 A. 2 d 1190 , 1191 (N.J. Super. Ch.
1988 ). Do the

unpredictabilities of talent, the ups and downs of life, and
evolving career choices make it advisable for courts to retain continuing
jurisdiction over

property divisions, so that adjustments can be made? What if
the husband in _Postema_ had decided to ditch law and write poetry in a cabin
in Montana?

For an argument that today’s celebrities are so dependent on
the vicissitudes of newer technology like social media that courts’ valuations
have to be

subject to adjustment over time, see Shanice Naidu, What’s
Love Got to Do with It? The Value of Celebrity Status in Divorce Proceedings,
33 Cardozo

Arts & Entertainment L.J. 573 ( 2015 ).

6 .Does treating the degree as property improperly commodify
some aspect of the degree spouse or the nondegree spouse’s contribution to the

marriage? On commodification, see Chapter III. Is this an
arena in which fears of commodification tend to work inequity on the nondegree
spouse? Is it

possible to avoid such inequity and provide for a “clean
break” in divorce? See, e.g., Margaret Jane Radin, Reinterpreting Property 32 –
24 ( 1993 ); Joan

Williams, Unbending Gender: Why Family and Work Conflict and
What to Do About It 118 ( 2000 ).

7 .What happens if a couple in a relationship that has not
been solemnized by marriage splits up? This was a major issue for same-sex
couples

before the U.S. Supreme Court held that they are entitled as
a matter of constitutional right to marry on the same basis as opposite-sex
couples. See

Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644 ( 2015 ). But marriage is
frequently viewed as optional by same-sex and opposite-sex couples alike. When
non-

formalized relationships break up, courts cannot call upon
the marital property statutes as a basis for a division of property. After long
not recognizing

contracts between unmarried cohabitants, many courts began
to apply contract law or restitution at the breakup of such relationships. (The
contract

approach has been termed “palimony” since the landmark case
of Marvin v. Marvin, 557 P. 2 d 106 (Cal. 1976 ) (in bank).) See “Palimony”

8 .Property division can be agreed upon in an antenuptial
agreement, but most couples do not take this route. What do you think most
couples

would agree on if presented ex ante with the question of how
to divide assets on divorce? Is this the right question to be asking?

9 .Might cases like _Postema_ reflect a fundamentally
contractarian view of marriage itself? Many observers, feminist and
nonfeminist, treat

marriage as a contract, see, e.g., Katherine K. Baker,
Comment, Contracting for Security: Paying Married Women What They’ve Earned, 55
U. Chi. L.

Rev. 1193 , 1206 – 13 , 1220 – 27 ( 1988 ); Cohen, supra.
But other models have their adherents. See Margaret F. Brinig, New Private Law
and the Family, in

The Oxford Handbook of the New Private Law 377 (Andrew S.
Gold et al. eds., 2021 ) (arguing for covenant rather than contract as the
basis for family

law). The law traditionally viewed marriage as a status with
fixed attributes. Somewhere between status and contract is the partnership
model, in which

equal sharing and some degree of a partnership “entity” is
assumed. Many feminist reformers argue that divorce and marital property law
should be

brought closer to the sharing ideal implicit in the
partnership model. See, e.g., Marjorie E. Kornhauser, Theory Versus Reality:
The Partnership Model of

Marriage in Family and Income Tax Law, 69 Temp. L. Rev. 1413
( 1996 ); see also Pepper Schwartz, Peer Marriages ( 1994 ) (documenting ideal
of “peer

marriage”—in which resources and responsibilities are
shared—and deviation of practice from such ideal); cf. Martha Fineman, The
Illusion of

Equality: The Rhetoric and Reality of Divorce Reform 2 – 6 ,
29 ( 1991 ) (arguing that family patterns are currently so unequal that women
are entitled to

more than an equal share); Ira Mark Ellman, “Contract
Thinking” Was _Marvin_ ’s Fatal Flaw, 76 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1365 ( 2001 )
(attacking the

contractarian basis of _Marvin_ ). Others find the notion of
an entity separate from the individuals in the marriage to be problematic, with
its overtones of

the common-law merger of the wife’s personality into the
“unity” of the marriage. As we noted earlier, entity law, such as that
governing partnerships,

has become somewhat more contractarian and customizable in
recent years. What is most appropriate for marriage? To what extent does
marriage rely

on informal third-party enforcement (for example, through
gossip and the like)? Should it? Depending on your answer to this question,

should marriage be subject to the _numerus clausus_ with
respect to some of its features? See Elizabeth F. Emens, Regulatory Fictions:
On Marriage and

Countermarriage, 99 Cal. L. Rev. 235 ( 2011 ) (examining
other conceptions of marriage and possible regulatory responses).

(^1) Contingent remainders were historically regarded as
“destructible” if the preceding estate terminated for a reason other than its
natural termination through death. Thus, if Homer

committed treason, and this led to the forfeiture of his
life estate, the two alternative contingent remainders would both be destroyed.
In this scenario, Blackacre would revert to Marge under

her implied reversion.

(^2) The one exception to this generalization is for
situations in which an executory interest can change into an indefeasibly
vested remainder. For example, O transfers Blackacre “to A for

life, remainder to B, but if B fails to survive A, then to
C.” If B predeceases A, then C’s executory interest becomes an indefeasibly
vested remainder.

(^111) Thus, other market participants include those whose
actual dealings with watches occur by means other than consensual transactions.

(^3) The discount rate ( _r_ ), the percentage by which
money will change in value over time, is related to the nominal interest rate
and the expected rate of inflation:

( 1 + _i_ ) = ( 1 + _r_ )( 1 + _e_ ), where _i_ is the
nominal interest rate and _e_ is the expected inflation rate.

(^4) More generally, an amount _C_ in the future equals the
present value _P_ times the sum of one and the discount factor _r_ , applied
for the requisite number _n_ of time periods (here years), i.e.,

_C_ = _P_ ( 1 + _r_ ) _n_. We can do this in reverse as
well. From a future nominal amount we can calculate the present discounted
value using the formula _P_ = _C_ /( 1 + _r_ ) _n_.

(^2) It is arguable that the gift deed created a fee simple
determinable. However, in doubtful cases the preferred construction is in favor
of an estate subject to a condition subsequent.

***** “The conceptual argument is that the law defines the
exact nature of every estate in land, that each has certain incidents which are
provided by law, and that one of the principal

incidents of a fee is alienability. Manning, The Development
of Restraints on Alienation Since Gray, 48 Harv. L. Rev. 373 ( 1935 ).

“The first of the two reasons most often given for holding
restraints void is that a restraint is repugnant to the nature of the fee.
Murray v. Green, 28 P. 118 (Cal. 1883 ); Eastman Marble

Co. v. Vermont Marble Co., 128 N.E. 177 (Mass. 1920 );
Andrews v. Hall, 58 N.W. 2 d 201 (Neb. 1953 ); 5 Tiffany, Real Property § 1343
( 3 d ed. 1939 ); Manning, supra, at 401. However, Lord

Coke believed that restraints were void, not only because
they were repugnant to the fee, but because “it is absurd and repugnant to
reason” that a tenant in fee simple should be restrained “of

all his power to alien.” Co. Litt. 223 a.

“The second and more practically oriented reason for holding
restraints void is that a restraint, by taking land out of the flow of
commerce, is detrimental to the economy. Gray,

Restraints on Alienation § 21 ( 2 d ed. 1895 ); 6 Powell,
Real Property 1 ( 1958 ); 5 Tiffany, op. cit. supra, § 1343. Other reasons have
been accepted on occasion by courts: to encourage

improvement of property; hampering effect[ive] use of
property if the buyer could put it to better use than the seller; removal from
trade of increasing amounts of capital; not allowing an

individual to appear more prosperous than he is, i.e., a
borrower may appear to own property outright, thus able to sell it in payment
of a debt, where in reality the property is restrained;

balance of dead hand control, i.e., recognizing the right of
the individual to control property after death by the proposition that life is
for the living and should be controlled by the living and

not by the extended hand of the dead. Bernhard, The Minority
Doctrine Concerning Direct Restraints on Alienation, 57 Mich. L. Rev. 1173 ,
1177 ( 1959 ).” ( 12 UCLA L. Rev. No. 3 , 956 .)

(^5) Or the conversion of the executory interest into a
vested remainder, as in Note 2 of Part B. 2 .b supra.

***** [This interest would be termed a “fee simple subject
to executory limitation” on the more widely used terminology adopted in this
book, with fee simple determinable being reserved

for an interest followed by an interest reserved by the
grantor (a possibility of reverter).—eds.]

(^2) There would be a different result if the interests of
the city of Klamath Falls were characterized as a fee simple on a condition
subsequent, which is also known as a fee simple

conditional. When such an estate is created, there is no
forfeiture until the grantor exercises his right of re-entry.

(^3) It is well settled that the rule against perpetuities
does not apply to possibilities of reverter. Gray, The Rule Against
Perpetuities 46 , 348 , 349 , §§ 41 , 313 , 314 ( 4 th ed. 1942 ); Simes and

Smith, The Law of Future Interests 311 , § 825 ( 2 d ed.
1956 ); Tiffany, Real Property 167 , § 404 ( 3 d ed. 1939 ). This historical
anomaly has been criticized for allowing “dead hand rule” and

creating “appalling practical results” when a possibility of
reverter does fall in many years after the original grant. Leach, Perpetuities
in Perspective: Ending the Rule’s Reign of Terror, 65

Harv.L.Rev. 721 , 739 ( 1952 ); Leach, Perpetuities: The
Nutshell Revisited, 78 Harv.L.Rev. 973 , 980 ( 1965 ). * * * Where the rule
against perpetuities has been applied to possibilities of

reverter, it has always been done by legislative action.

Future Interests, 45 Va.L.Rev. 339 , 362 ( 1959 ).

(^4) ORS 93. 120 provides:

* * * Any conveyance of real estate passes all the estate of
      the grantor, unless the intent to pass a lesser estate appears by express
      terms, or is necessarily implied in the terms of the

grant.

(^5) ORS 57. 630 ( 2 ) provides:

Whenever any such corporation is the owner of real or
personal property, or claims any interest or lien whatsoever in any real or
personal property, such corporation shall continue

to exist during such five-year period for the purpose of
conveying, transferring and releasing such real or personal property or
interest or lien therein, and such corporation shall

continue after the expiration of such five-year period to
exist as a body corporate for the purpose of being made a party to, and being
sued in any action, suit or proceeding against it

involving the title to any such real or personal property or
any interest therein, and not otherwise; and any such action, suit or
proceeding may be instituted and maintained against

any such corporation as might have been had prior to the
expiration of said five-year period. This section shall not be construed as
affecting or suspending any statute of limitations

applicable to any suit, action or proceeding instituted
hereunder.

(^6) It is difficult to understand the reason for the rule
that a future interest in the nature of a possibility of reverter should be
inalienable.

(^1) General Statutes § 52 – 500 states:

Sale of Real or Personal Property Owned by Two or More. Any
court of equitable jurisdiction may, upon the complaint of any person
interested, order the sale of any estate, real or

personal, owned by two or more persons, when, in the opinion
of the court, a sale will better promote the interests of the owners. The
provisions of this section shall extend to and

include land owned by two or more persons, when the whole or
a part of such land is vested in any person for life with remainder to his
heirs, general or special, or, on failure of

such heirs, to any other person, whether the same, or any
part thereof, is held in trust or otherwise. A conveyance made in pursuance of
a decree ordering a sale of such land shall

vest the title in the purchaser thereof, and shall bind the
person entitled to the life estate and his legal heirs and any other person
having a remainder interest in the lands; but the

court passing such decree shall make such order in relation
to the investment of the avails of such sale as it deems necessary for the
security of all persons having any interest in

such land.

(^3) The defendant’s business functions on the property
consist of the overnight parking, repair and storage of trucks, including
refuse trucks, the repair, storage and cleaning of dumpsters,

the storage of tools, and general office work. No refuse is
actually deposited on the property.

(^5) Such a partition is authorized by General Statutes § 52
– 495 which states:

Partition of Joint and Common Estates. Courts having
jurisdiction of actions for equitable relief may, upon the complaint of any
person interested, order partition of any real estate

held in joint tenancy, tenancy in common or coparcenary, and
may appoint a committee for that purpose, and may in like manner make partition
of any real estate held by tenants in

tail; and decrees aparting entailed estates shall bind the
parties and all persons who thereafter claim title to such estate as heirs of
their bodies.

(^7) If the physical partition results in unequal shares, a
money award can be made from one tenant to another to equalize the shares. 4 A

American Law of Property, Partition § 6. 26 , p. 113.

(^11) These other factors included the present use and the
expected continued use by the defendant of the property, the property’s zoning
classification, and the plaintiffs’ proposed

subdivision plans. We consider these factors later in the
opinion.

(^2) It follows that the burden to establish ouster in a
suit to recover rents and profits is less stringent than the burden to
establish ouster in an adverse possession action.

(^4) For example, cotenants have recovered their cost of
painting buildings to make them suitable for sale or renting, Scott v. Staggs,
276 P. 2 d 605 (Cal. Ct. App. 1954 ); completing a

partially finished house, Todd v. Stewart, 202 N.W. 844
(Iowa 1925 ); and making miscellaneous house repairs, Fassitt v. Seip, 95 A.
273 (Pa. 1915 ).

(^3) These underlying assumptions concern annual salary
figures, promotions, tax rates, and calculations designed to account for the
fact that, over time, earnings are attributable more to

the individual degree holder’s personal skills and effort,
rather than to the degree itself.

## CHAPTER VI

# ENTITY PROPERTY

The forms of property considered in Chapter V are relatively
few in number. To revert to a distinction introduced in Chapter I, they largely

reflect an exclusion strategy for dealing with resources,
rather than a governance strategy. That is, each of the traditional forms like
the fee

simple, the life estate, and even the tenancy in common
operates on the assumption that, at any given point in time, one person or a
small number

of persons will function as the “gatekeeper” of the
resource. The exclusion strategy, however, is too crude to serve as an
effective basis for

managing the resources used by complex entities like
high-rise apartment buildings, business firms, and pension plans. In order to
provide for

more effective management of resources in these complicated
settings, the law has developed certain devices that effectively allow owners
to

switch to a governance strategy for the management of
resources. These devices can be termed “entity property.”

The key attribute of these entity property devices is that
they permit the management of resources to be separated from their use and

enjoyment. This separation allows the managerial or
governance function to be concentrated in the hands of specialists, while the
use and

enjoyment is distributed over a larger and more diffuse
group of individuals. Indeed, the principal difference between the traditional
legal forms

studied in Chapter V, and the entity property devices
considered in this Chapter, is that the traditional forms do not permit
specialization in the

day-to-day management of assets (at least formally), whereas
the property devices considered here do permit such specialization. This

specialization of functions, more than anything else,
explains why entity property devices are so popular.

Although devices for separating management from use and
enjoyment of resources can be categorized in different ways, we divide them

here broadly in functional terms, based on the nature of the
interests of those who use and enjoy the resources. Thus, we distinguish
between

devices whose function is to govern multiple possessory
interests in the use of a single complex of assets, and devices whose function
is to

govern multiple nonpossessory interests in the enjoyment of
assets (typically interests in the nature of a passive investment). The
principal

devices in the former category include leases, cooperatives,
and condominiums. Each of these devices can be used to separate management of a

complex of assets from regular actual use of some portion of
the assets by various persons or family units. The principal devices in the
latter

category include trusts, corporations, nonprofit entities,
and partnerships. Here, the organizational form is designed primarily to
separate

management of a complex of assets from the

#636

enjoyment of financial or other intangible returns for
various persons or family units.

Another broad distinction among these devices is legal
rather than functional. Specifically, one can distinguish between devices that
achieve

a functional specialization between management and
beneficial use of resources at the level of property rights, and devices that
achieve this

separation at the level of entity law proper. In the former
category belong the lease, the condominium, and the trust, which all achieve
this

division of labor at the level of property rights. With
leases, for example, both the lessor and the lessee are regarded as having a
type of property

right (the leasehold estate and the reversion,
respectively), and the nature of these different property rights allows them to
specialize their

functions. Lease law creates an “entity” for managing
property in a functional sense. Other devices that we briefly consider here,
including the

cooperative, the corporation, and the partnership, achieve a
similar division of labor through provisions of entity law—by creating an
actual

separate legal entity. With corporations, for example, the
corporation is regarded as a legal persona that owns property in its own name,
much the

way individual persons own property, and the specialization
of functions among shareholders, corporate managers, and corporate employees is

achieved through the law of corporations, not through
property law. This explains why we spend little time here on corporations and
partnerships

—the legal rules for these entities are covered in courses
on business associations. But it is important to keep in mind that,
functionally speaking,

corporations and partnerships can often serve as substitutes
for leases or trusts, so it is worth setting forth the full menu of options in
managing

complex property rights through entity property.

### A. SEPARATING MANAGEMENT AND POSSESSORY RIGHTS

We begin with a series of arrangements in which multiple
persons have distinct possessory interests in a complex of assets. A
preliminary

question is why people would ever want to enter into such
arrangements. An important part of the answer seems to be that they want to
take

advantage of the specialized skills of managers of assets,
and in particular to concentrate managerial control over common areas or shared

facilities that present potential collective action problems
or commons tragedies. A key difference among these mechanisms concerns the

participants’ ability or willingness to commit their own
assets to the enterprise. Leases are attractive to those who cannot or do not
want to invest

their own resources in the larger enterprise; condominiums
and cooperatives are more attractive to those who do want to make such an

investment (either for tax or other reasons).

#637

### 1 .LEASES

Leases, also known as leaseholds, tenancies, the term of
years, or landlord-tenant interests—the terms are basically interchangeable—are

probably the second-most commonly encountered form of
property after full ownership (the fee simple in the case of land). An
astonishing array

of things are leased, including both real and personal
property. On the real property side, we find leases of agricultural land,
commercial office

buildings, shopping centers, and of course apartments and
houses. On the personal property side, there are leases of heavy construction

equipment, computers, autos, tools, and even airplanes. The
percentage of real property interests that are leased has held constant or has
grown

slightly in recent years. The percentage of personal
property interests (such as autos, rail cars, and shipping containers) that are
leased has

exploded in recent decades.

The law that governs leases is very old, having its roots in
Roman law. In civil law countries like France that trace their lineage more

directly to Roman law, leases are regarded as a specialized
form of contract ( contrat de louage ). At common law in England, leases of
land

gradually emerged as a form of property. Initially, leases
were not recognized as a type of freehold interest, and the tenant was not
regarded as

being seised of the land. Consequently, leases were
categorized as a type of personal property (“chattels real”), and passed upon
death by rules

for personal property. But by the thirteenth century, the
common-law courts granted protection to the holder of a term of years. See
A.W.B.

Simpson, A History of The Land Law 74–75 (2d ed. 1986).
Gradually—and with much confusion along the way—leases were assimilated to the

system of estates in land created for freehold interests,
and were given full protection as an interest in land. Once this assimilation
occurred,

leases could be thought of as another form of property, like
the fee simple, life estate, and defeasible fees we studied in the last
chapter.

Whether we categorize leases as a species of contract or a
form of property, it is clear that leases have always been regarded as a
distinct

type of interest in the use and control of things. A key
reason for this is that both the lessor and the lessee play an active role in
the governance of

the underlying asset. During the term of the lease, the
lessee is in possession of the asset and as such exercises primary control over
it. But the

lessor also has a keen interest how the lessee exercises
this control. In part this is because the lessor expects to get the asset back
once the lease

expires; leases always have a duration less than the full
useful life of the asset, and the lessor will want to constrain or at least
monitor the

behavior of the lessee to make sure the asset still has
value when it comes back. Lessees also pay the lessor for the use of the asset,
nearly always

in the form of periodic payments called rent. The lessor
will be concerned to make sure the lessee is in a position to continue to make
these

payments in a timely fashion.

#638

In terms of the evolutionary struggle for survival among
different property forms, leases are clearly one of the big winners.
Generalizing

broadly, the three forms of legal ownership of greatest
continuing importance are the fee simple (and full ownership), the lease, and
the trust. (As

noted earlier, ownership of property by corporations and
partnerships, which is also very common, is not regarded as a separate form of
property;

thus, corporate or partnership property is nearly always
held by these entities as a fee simple or lease.) There appear to be three
functional aspects

of leases that account for the lease’s enduring appeal. See
generally Thomas W. Merrill, The Economics of Leasing, 12 J. Legal Analysis 1

(2020).

First, leases are a type of de facto financing device. One
can think of a lease as an arrangement in which the owner of an asset lends

possession to another, in return for periodic payments of
money called rent. Indeed, it appears that the original function of leases was
to avoid the

medieval Church’s prohibition of usury: “A capitalist would
give to an embarrassed landowner a sum of money down; in return he took a term
of

years sufficiently long to enable him to recover the
capital, together with his profits, out of the revenues of the land.” Theodore
F.T. Plucknett, A

Concise History of the Common Law 572–73 (5th ed. 1956). The
close relationship between leases and loans is revealed today by the common

practices of entering into a lease with an option to
purchase at the end of the lease term (universally used with automobile leases,
for example).

Given that leases are a type of financing device, it is
clear that the rent charge includes an interest component, reflecting the time
value of money

and the anticipated rate of inflation.

Once we see that leases are a type of financing device, we
can understand part of their appeal. Persons who have not accumulated much in

the way of assets and/or have poor credit will often prefer
to lease assets rather than purchase them. This allows them to acquire shelter
to live in,

land to farm, or space in which to operate a business like a
restaurant, without having to commit their scarce resources to purchasing real
estate.

Instead, the lessee can concentrate her limited resources on
acquiring other inputs—like furniture for the apartment, or equipment to
operate the

farm, or tables and chairs for the restaurant. If the lessee
prospers and accumulates more capital or develops a stronger credit rating, the
lessee

may eventually decide to own rather than lease the real
estate in question. Or maybe not: Leases allow persons to “leverage” their
limited

resources in roughly the same way that borrowing allows
persons to leverage limited resources, and so for any given level of resources
some

persons will prefer to continue to keep on leasing in order
to leverage into larger apartments, bigger farms, more restaurants, etc. than
they started

out with.

Second, and related to the first point, leases operate as a
risk-spreading device. Consider this first from the lessee’s perspective.
Suppose

you move to a new city to take up a new job. You are not
sure

#639

you will like either the city or the job. You have
accumulated enough in savings to purchase a home or apartment in the new city,
but you are

reluctant to tie up most of your funds in the purchase of
one asset, given that you may decide to move elsewhere if things don’t work
out.

Renting is a way of minimizing the risks of investing most
of your savings in an asset that you may want to unload in fairly short order
(and an

asset whose risk may be tightly correlated with one’s
employment risk). The ability to minimize the risk from a new venture has been
a powerful

reason for leasing rather than owning over a wide range of
activities for as long as leases have been around.

From the lessor’s perspective, leasing can be a
risk-spreading device as well. If the lessee defaults on the rental obligation,
it is usually

easier to retake possession of the property than it is to
foreclose on a mortgage and retake property held as security for a loan (see
Chapter VII).

Even greater risk spreading can be achieved if the lessor
leases to multiple lessees. Some lessees may fail and default on payment of
rent, but it is

unlikely that all or even most will, and so the lessor can
minimize the risk of nonpayment by spreading this risk over multiple lessees.
The built-

in security interest provided by leases and the ability to
spread risks among multiple leaseholders have long made leasing of property a
popular

form of investment.

Third, and relevant to the larger themes of this Chapter,
leases operate as a mechanism for integrating and managing complexes of assets,

and in that sense function as a kind of entity property.
Moreover, lessors are often actual legal entities (corporations, partnerships,
and the like).

In any event, leasing allows owners of resources to switch
from a simple exclusion strategy to a governance strategy in overcoming various

coordination problems. Not all leases fit this description.
Some leases, like a lease of agricultural land, may function primarily as
financing

and/or risk-spreading devices. Here, simple possession is
transferred from the lessor to the lessee, and the property continues to be
managed

using an exclusion strategy—with the lessee now exercising
the right to exclude. Not surprisingly, agricultural leases are frequently oral
or, if in

writing, are very short. See Douglas W. Allen & Dean
Lueck, The “Back Forty” on a Handshake: Specific Assets, Reputation, and the
Structure

of Farmland Contracts, 8 J.L. Econ. & Org. 366 (1992).
But often leasing is used for highly complicated complexes of assets, like
high-rise

apartment buildings, office buildings, and shopping centers.
Leases allow these complexes of assets to be managed using a governance
strategy,

characterized by a specialization of functions. One party
(the lessor) specializes in constructing, maintaining, insuring, and
coordinating assets

common to the entire complex, while the other parties (the
lessees) specialize in possession and operation of discrete units within the
larger

complex. In a shopping center, for example, the lessor can
build, maintain, and insure the parking lot, the utility systems, the common
walkways,

and can even provide marketing for the complex as a whole.

#640

The lessees are thereby freed up to concentrate on the
design, construction, and maintenance of their individual retail spaces. Both
the common

areas and the individual retail spaces are probably managed
more effectively and with lower transaction costs because of this
specialization of

functions. A similar story can be told about apartment
complexes and office buildings.

Although we usually think of leases in the context of
interests in land, leasing is also very commonly used to acquire personal
property like

airplanes and automobiles. To some extent, the use of
leasing in these contexts is driven by tax considerations, such as the ease of
treating auto

lease payments as a business expense. But we can also see
the general economic rationale for leasing at work here too. Auto leasing, for

example, is clearly a financing device, and functions as a
substitute for purchasing an auto with a loan secured by a lien on the auto.
Indeed,

many banks and financing companies offer both auto leases
and loans to consumers. Can you see how automobile leases might also function
as

risk-spreading devices and as a device allowing
specialization of functions between automobile dealers and consumers?

One problem that has long vexed lease law in the real
property context is that it does not differentiate between leases in terms of
the

underlying functional reasons the parties have for entering
into a lease. Instead, one body of legal doctrine has been developed that must

accommodate both simple leases used as financing or
risk-spreading devices, and complex leases used to provide governance
structures for

complicated enterprises serving multiple persons. To put the
matter more concretely, the same law generally applies to long-term (or
routinely

renewed) leases of agricultural land and to short-term
rentals of furnished apartments. Much of the tension in lease law is
attributable to this one-

size-fits-all aspect. Lease law was formed during an era
when leases were simple and were largely used as financing and risk-spreading
devices,

with the agricultural lease being the central example. Over
time, the cases that came before the courts tended increasingly to involve
complicated

problems of governance, the multi-unit residential apartment
building being the central example. The law has responded by moving at least
part

way from a “property” or exclusion model of leases to a
“contract” or governance model, while continuing to strain to encompass both
types of

situations within a single body of doctrine.

Leases of personal property are governed in every state by
Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code, originally adopted in 1987. Many

of the provisions of Article 2A were borrowed from Article 2
of the Code, which governs sales of personal property. So the law that applies
to

the growing field of personal property leasing has a
relatively contractual flavor and is governed by a statute; in contrast, real
property leases are

property-like in certain dimensions and are governed by
common law principles. It is nevertheless likely that the common law of real
property

leasing will be invoked to fill certain gaps in Article 2A
as they emerge,

#641

and that certain features of Article 2A may influence the
continuing development of the common law of real property leasing. The coverage
of

leasing here is limited to real property leases.

a.LEASE TYPES

The common law generally recognized four types of leases:
the term of years, the periodic tenancy, the tenancy at will, and the tenancy
at

sufferance.

Term of Years. This refers to a lease that has a fixed time
at which it terminates or ends. Usually this is for one or more years (hence
the

name), but it can be for a shorter time, like six months or
even one day. Some jurisdictions impose an outer limit on the length of a term
of years,

like 99 years; but others do not, and some leases have been
reported to exist that last for as long as 9000 years. Although the original
Statute of

Frauds (see Chapter VIII) required that leases longer than
three years had to be in writing in order to be enforceable, under the version
of the

Statute in effect in most states, leases for any term longer
than one year must be in writing.

The unique legal aspect of the term of years is that neither
the lessor nor the lessee is required to give notice to the other before
terminating

the relationship. On the stated day of termination, the
lease simply ends. Usually, of course, the parties will communicate about what
will happen

upon termination, which in practice means they may negotiate
a new term of years (or perhaps a periodic lease) to commence on the
termination

date. But this is not required. The lessee can just walk
away, or the lessor can just reclaim possession, on the designated day of
termination.

Periodic Tenancy. This refers to a lease that automatically
rolls over for a stated period of time, usually a year or a month. Thus, a
lease

from year to year is a periodic tenancy that automatically
rolls over one year at a time, and a lease from month to month is a periodic
tenancy that

automatically rolls over one month at a time.

In contrast to the term of years, a periodic tenancy
requires that each of the parties give notice to the other if they desire to
terminate the

lease. Usually, the notice period is the same as the period
of recurring rollover. In a lease from month to month, the required notice is
one month.

In a lease from year to year, the required notice at common
law was six months, although this has been modified by statute in many
jurisdictions,

especially for residential tenancies, with most statutes
prescribing one month’s notice for termination of a tenancy from year to year.

Tenancy at Will. This refers to a tenancy that lasts only so
long as both parties wish it to continue. Either party can terminate at any
time

for any reason.

#642

At common law, no notice was required for termination of a
tenancy at will. This has been changed in many jurisdictions to require notice

equal to the period of time at which rent payments are made.

Tenancy at Sufferance. This is sometimes not regarded as a
true tenancy and refers to the situation that exists when an individual, who
was

once in rightful possession of property, holds over after
this right has ended. A tenant at sufferance differs from a trespasser in that
the tenant’s

original entry was not wrongful. In many jurisdictions, this
difference may limit the lessor’s ability to use self-help to evict the tenant
at

sufferance. See Berg v. Wiley, excerpted in Chapter IV.
Otherwise, however, the lessor is free to evict the tenant at sufferance using
forcible entry

and detainer statutes, or by bringing an action in
ejectment.

Suppose a tenant at sufferance mails the lessor a check
equal to the rent specified under an expired lease, and the lessor cashes the
check?

Some courts have construed the lessee’s proffer of the check
and the lessor’s cashing it to be an implied contract to create a new lease
(typically a

periodic tenancy). See, e.g., Crechale & Polles, Inc. v.
Smith, 295 So.2d 275 (Miss. 1974).

PROBLEMS

1 .On January 23 , L agrees to rent to T a furnished
apartment until February 23 of the same year. What type of tenancy is created?

2 .L agrees to lease a farm to T from year to year, starting
on March 1. On November 1 , L notifies T that the lease will terminate the
following

March 1. Under the common law, what type of tenancy does T
have come March 1?

3 .T is a defense contractor. War breaks out, and T needs
additional warehouse space. L agrees to lease a warehouse to T “for the
duration of the

war.” What type of tenancy is created?

NOTE AND QUESTIONS

The limited menu of lease types (term of years, periodic, at
will, at sufferance) is another example of the _numerus clausus_ principle,
considered in

Chapter V. Why do you suppose the common law recognized only
four types of leases? The leasehold interest is primarily of significance to
two parties

—the lessor and the lessee—and they are permitted great
flexibility in negotiating various terms and conditions in the written lease
that typically

governs their relationship (and must govern their
relationship for leases of more than one year under the Statute of Frauds). Can
one explain the

standardization of lease types in terms of third-party
interests in acquiring information about lease arrangements? Is it perhaps
significant that most of

the standardization serves to differentiate among leases
that are short-term and often are not governed by a written lease agreement?

b.THE INDEPENDENT COVENANTS MODEL

It took some time before leases came to be used as an entity
property device for managing large real estate complexes. Early leases

functioned almost entirely as financing and risk-spreading
devices. In that context, the courts developed certain assumptions about the
nature of

the reciprocal obligations between lessor and lessee. A
central assumption was that the lease was at heart a conveyance of a possessory
interest in

property. The possessory right—including the right to
exclude others from the asset—was transferred from the lessor to the lessee for
the

prescribed term of the lease. This assumption, in turn, led
to certain critical conclusions about the allocation of risk of casualty losses
as between

the lessor and the lessee during the lease term.

#### Paradine v. Jane

```



King’s Bench, 1647.



Aleyn 27 , 82 Eng. Rep. 897.



```

In debt the plaintiff declares upon a lease for years
rendering rent at the four usual feasts; and for rent behind for three years,
ending at the

Feast of the Annunciation, 21 Car. brings his action; the
defendant pleads, that a certain German prince, by name Prince Rupert, an alien
born,

enemy to the King and kingdom, had invaded the realm with an
hostile army of men; and with the same force did enter upon the defendant’s

possession, and him expelled, and held out of possession
from the 19 of July 18 Car. till the Feast of the Annunciation, 21 Car. whereby
he could

not take the profits; whereupon the plaintiff demurred, and
the plea was resolved insufficient * * *

It was resolved, that the matter of the plea was
insufficient; for though the whole army had been alien enemies, yet he ought to
pay his rent.

And this difference was taken, that where the law creates a
duty or charge, and the party is disabled to perform it without any default in
him, and

hath no remedy over, there the law will excuse him. * * *
Now the rent is a duty created by the parties upon the reservation, and had
there been a

covenant to pay it, there had been no questions but the
lessee must have made it good, notwithstanding the interruption by enemies, for
the law

would not protect him beyond his own agreement, no more than
in the case of reparations; this reservation then being a covenant in law, and

whereupon an action of covenant hath been maintained (as
Roll said) it is all one as if there had been an actual covenant. Another
reason was

added, that as the lessee is to have the advantage of casual
profits, so he must run the hazard of casual losses, and not lay the whole
burthen of

them upon his lessor; and Dyer 56.6 was cited for this
purpose, that though the land be surrounded, or gained by the sea, or made
barren by

wildfire, yet the lessor shall have his whole rent: and
judgment was given for the plaintiff.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1. _Paradine v. Jane_ is an extreme example of the
   artificiality of common-law pleading. Prince Rupert, described in the case
   report as “enemy to the

King,” was in fact King Charles I’s nephew and best general.
The “alien armies” were the armies for the King, composed almost exclusively of
native

Englishmen. The apparent explanation for this deliberate
fabrication is that England was at Civil War. The courts were under control of
Parliament, yet

the common-law lawyers “had not yet imagined a basis for
traditional common-law rights outside the old framework of royal authority.”
Hence the false

pleading, in which the King’s forces are described as “alien
armies” and “enemies of the King,” meaning, in reality, enemies of Parliament.
See Charles

M. Haar & Lance Liebman, Property and Law 270 – 71 ( 2 d
ed. 1985 ).

2. _Paradine_ reflects the view that a lease is a conveyance
   of an interest in land, but it also reflects the view that a lease is a
   contract—a bundle of

covenants or promises, some running from lessor to lessee,
others from lessee to lessor. The most important covenant by the lessor was
(and is) the

covenant of quiet enjoyment, meaning a promise not to
interfere with the lessee’s possession during the term of the lease. This
covenant is critical to

```



645



```

the very conception of a lease—the transfer of possession of
property from lessor to lessee—and hence is implied as a matter of law in all
leases. The

most important covenant by the lessee was (and is) the
covenant to pay rent. As _Paradine_ suggests, this too was regarded as
sufficiently important that it

is implied as a matter of law in all leases. Evidently the
lease in _Paradine_ specified the amount of rent, but did not expressly include
a promise by the

lessee to pay rent. But the court holds that such a covenant
is implied as a matter of law in all leases.

3. _Paradine_ is a leading example of what has been called
   the independent covenants model of the lessor-lessee relationship. (With one
   exception:

Under this model, failure by the lessor to afford quiet
possession _does_ excuse the tenant from paying rent.) The assumption of
independent covenants

provides that all covenants must be performed without regard
to whether other covenants have been or can be performed. _Paradine_
specifically holds

that when Prince Rupert made it impossible for the lessee to
plant and harvest crops and hence to enjoy the benefit of the lease, this did
not excuse the

lessee from performing the covenant to pay rent.
Generalizing more broadly, even if the lessor fails to perform a covenant, such
as a covenant to repair

the premises, the lessee must continue to perform the
covenant to pay rent. Alternatively, even if the lessee fails to perform the
covenant to pay rent, the

lessor must continue to perform the covenant of quiet
possession. The remedy in all these events, under the independent covenants
model, is for the

aggrieved party to sue for damages for breach of covenant.
Thus, if the lessor fails to perform a covenant to repair, the lessee must
continue to pay rent

but may sue the lessor for breach of the covenant to repair.
Or if the lessee fails to pay rent, the lessor must continue to perform the
covenant of quiet

possession, i.e., allow the lessee to stay in possession,
but may sue the lessee for breach of the covenant to pay rent.

4. _Paradine_ is also important because of its recognition
   of the allocation of risk under a lease. The court notes that windfall gains,
   such as high

profits earned from high crop prices, would be captured by
the lessee. By parity of reasoning, wipeout losses, such as the seizure of the
farm by Prince

Rupert, should also be borne by the lessee. The general
principle recognized by the court—that the lessee is the “residual claimant”
with respect to

economic gains and losses associated with the property
during the term of the lease—continues to be sound. The typical lease for a
fixed rent converts

the lessor into a kind of bondholder who earns a fixed
periodic payment from the property. The lessee performs a role akin to a
shareholder, whose

return from the property fluctuates with the vicissitudes of
the weather and market conditions—and with the effort and skill the lessee puts
into it. See

Merrill, Economics of Leasing, supra, 12 J. Legal Analysis
at 20 – 24. This allocation of risk is important to bear in mind and will come
up later when we

consider certain specific controversies about how gains and
losses should be divided under leases.

5. _Paradine_ ’s specific application of this understanding
   of the allocation of risk is that casualty losses associated with the rented
   property (such as

destruction of the premises by fire, earthquake, flood, or
war) must

```



646



```

be borne by the lessee during the term of the lease, not the
lessor. In other words, when the property that is the subject of the lease is
destroyed or

damaged, the lessee’s obligation to pay rent continues
uninterrupted. Over time, this specific application of the allocation of risk
has gradually been

changed by legislation. For example, if the lease involves
residential housing, and the house or apartment burns down, this is deemed
today in all

jurisdictions to be an event that terminates the lease and
hence discharges the lessee from any further obligation to pay rent. The rules
with respect to

commercial property remain closer to the original
understanding of _Paradine_ , but have also been modified in various ways in
many jurisdictions. See 1

Milton R. Friedman, Friedman on Leases § 9 : 2 (Andrew R.
Berman, ed. & rev., 6 th ed. 2017 ). In a handful of jurisdictions, courts
have held that the

contract doctrines of impossibility and frustration of
purpose may apply to relieve a lessee of further obligations when the premises
are destroyed. See,

e.g., Albert M. Greenfield & Co. v. Kolea, 380 A. 2 d
758 (Pa. 1977 ). Whatever rule is followed, the allocation of risk of casualty
loss is generally

understood to be a default rule subject to modification by
the parties in the lease. Disputes over casualty losses today tend to turn on
how to interpret

these lease clauses. After Hurricane Katrina, for example, a
lessor attempted to terminate all leases in an apartment complex pursuant to a
clause that

gave the lessor the right to terminate or repair particular
apartments or buildings damaged by fire or other events. The court held that
this clause did not

authorize the termination of leases in buildings that had
not been significantly damaged. Horne v. TGM Associates, L.P., 56 So. 3 d 615 ,
623 – 24 (Ala.

2010 ).

Some Implications of the Independent Covenants Model

The independent covenants model reflected in Paradine v Jane
had a number of implications for lease law. One was that the lessor made no

implicit promises about the fitness of the property for the
lessee’s purposes. By acquiring possession of the property for the lease term,
the lessee

assumed all the risks associated with being in possession of
an interest in land generally. This was understood to be a default rule: The
lessee was

free to bargain for a warranty of quality, and if the lessor
agreed, this would be enforced by the court. But absent a specific lease clause

stipulating that the land would be fit for the lessee’s
intended purpose, the watchword was caveat lessee —let the lessee beware.

A particularly vivid illustration was provided by Sutton v.
Temple , 12 M & W. 52, 152 Eng. Rep. 1108 (Exch. 1843). Thomas Temple
signed

a lease to take 24 acres of pasture land from Anne Sutton.
After putting his cattle on the pasture, a number of them died. An autopsy by a

veterinarian revealed that the animals had been poisoned by
eating discarded paint chips concealed in manure that had been spread on the
land

(presumably by Sutton or a prior lessee) as fertilizer.
Temple had little choice but to pasture his cattle elsewhere. But the court
refused to excuse

him from paying the stipulated rent. It took the rule to be
“that if a person contract for the use and occupation of land for a specified
time,

#647

and at a specified rent, he is bound by that bargain, even
though he took it for a particular purpose, and that purpose be not attained.”

The rule of caveat lessee was in some tension with the law
of contracts as it emerged with respect to sales of personal property, where an

implied warranty of fitness for intended purpose came to be
recognized. The tension came to a head in cases involving short term rentals of

furnished vacation cottages. Here the lease included both
reality (the land and the structure) and personal property (the furnishings).
Courts in

both England and the United States recognized an implied
warranty of habitability in such cases. See Smith v. Marrable, 152 Eng. Rep.
693

(Exch. 1843); Ingalls v. Hobbs, 31 N.E. 286 (Mass. 1892).
One can imagine how the law might have gradually evolved, with the furnished

cottage exception gradually expanding to encompass
situations like rentals of apartments in multi-unit urban apartment complexes.
But the law

did not evolve in this way. Instead, courts tended to
continue to assume that rentals of unfurnished apartments were governed by the
rule of

caveat lessee. Then, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a
sudden avulsion occurred, as one jurisdiction after another recognized an
implied

warranty of habitability in apartment rentals. See Javins v.
First National Realty, infra.

Paradine implies that if the lessee is deprived of
possession by some action of the lessor, as opposed to a third party like
Prince Rupert, the

lessee is off the hook for any further payment of rent to
the lessor. In effect, at least one lease covenant—the covenant to pay rent—was
regarded

as dependent on the lessor’s compliance with the covenant of
quiet possession. Courts tended to be quite strict about this. Thus, in Smith
v.

McEnany , 48 N.E. 781 (Mass. 1897), the lessor leased a lot
with a shed on it to the lessee. Later, the lessor put up a brick wall on an
adjoining

property, which intruded by one or two feet into the lot
behind the shed. The court held that the intrusion was a partial eviction of
the lessee that

justified the lessee in stopping all rent payments until the
intrusion was fixed. Writing for the court, Justice Holmes wrote: “The land is
hired as

one whole. If by his own fault the landlord withdraws a part
of it he cannot recover either on the lease or outside of it for the occupation
of the

residue.”

The most common situation when the covenant of quiet
possession came into play was when it turned out that some third party other
than

the lessor owned the land, and the third party brought an
action to evict the lessee. This was universally regarded as a breach of the
lessor’s

covenant of quiet possession that justified the lessee in
terminating any further payments of rent. But what if the parties concluded a
lease, and on

the appointed starting day a holdover tenant was still in
possession of the land? Should the holdover tenant be regarded like Prince
Rupert—

making it the lessee’s responsibility to evict the
holdover—or should the holdover be regarded like a third party claiming
superior title—making

it the lessor’s responsibility to evict the holdover? Here
the authorities

#648

were (and still are) divided. Under the so-called “English
rule,” the lessor is responsible for clearing out any squatters or holdover
tenants at the

beginning of the lease. Coe v. Clay, 130 Eng. Rep. 1131
(C.P. 1829). Under what has been called the “American rule” (although it is not
followed

by all American states), the lessee is responsible for
getting rid of any squatters or holdover tenants. Hannan v. Dusch, 153 S.E. 824
(Va. 1930).

Either way, the parties are free to modify the rule by
drafting an appropriate lease clause that allocates responsibility differently.

Whether the lessor has a duty to deliver possession at the
onset of the lease illustrates the difficulty of prescribing a single rule that
fits all

situations. Assuming both parties are fully informed about
the relevant variables, the rule they would adopt would plausibly be the one
that

assigns the duty to the party who is best able to detect the
presence of squatters or holdover tenants and to bring an action to have them
evicted

before the lease starts. In the context of urban apartments,
that party is almost surely the lessor. The lessor either lives on the property
or has a

manager on the property, is familiar with the leasing
history, and has some familiarity with eviction procedures (see Chapter IV on
forcible entry

and detainer (FED) statutes). But in other circumstances,
the lessee may be the “cheaper evicter.” Consider, for example, a lease of
rural

agricultural land where the lessee is likely to be a local
resident and the lessor is often an absentee owner. In these circumstances, the
lessee may

be in a better position to monitor for squatters and
holdover tenants, and to take action to evict them. Since it is not clear that
there is a right

answer about the correct default rule that fits all
circumstances, it is perhaps not surprising that there is a division of
authority as to which rule is

better. Perhaps the ideal solution would be to have
different default rules for different types of leases. But this is probably
best accomplished by

legislation, and for whatever reasons, legislatures have not
been interested in reform at this level of detail.

c.EXTENSIONS OF THE INDEPENDENT COVENANTS MODEL

As time marched on, a variety of exceptions and
qualifications to the pure independent covenants model emerged. One of the most

important was the development of forfeiture clauses. These
were clauses in leases, invariably insisted upon by lessors, providing that
upon the

lessee’s violation of enumerated covenants in the lease—most
crucially the covenant to pay rent—the lessee’s interest in the lease would be

immediately forfeited.

Forfeiture clauses, which courts have generally upheld, in
effect convert the specified tenant covenants covered by the forfeiture clause

from independent covenants into dependent covenants. For
example, under the model of independent covenants, the lessor’s covenant of
quiet

possession was not extinguished by the tenant’s failure to
pay rent. The lessor’s remedy was periodically to sue the tenant for damages
equal to

the unpaid rent. With the addition of an enforceable
forfeiture clause, the

#649

situation is radically changed. Now, the lessee’s failure to
pay rent means that the lessee’s interest in the leasehold estate is subject to
forfeiture,

in effect releasing the lessor from the covenant of quiet
enjoyment. If the lessee remains in possession after forfeiture, he becomes a
tenant at

sufferance, liable to an action for eviction. If the lessee
abandons after forfeiture, the lessor can immediately reenter and retake
possession of the

premises.

Forfeiture clauses had the effect of tilting the original
independent covenants model in favor of the lessor, in that they transformed
the lease

into a bundle of covenants that were independent insofar as
the promises ran to the lessee, and dependent insofar as the promises ran to
the

lessor. But the legal system responded by developing new
doctrines that provided some relief for lessees. We consider here two such
doctrines:

constructive eviction and surrender.

#### Blackett v. Olanoff

```



Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, 1977.



358 N.E. 2 d 817.



```

■
WILKINS, JUSTICE. The defendant in each of these consolidated actions for rent
successfully raised constructive eviction as a defense against the

landlords’ claim. The judge found that the tenants were
“very substantially deprived” of quiet enjoyment of their leased premises “ for
a

substantial time ” (emphasis original). He ruled that the
tenants’ implied warranty of quiet enjoyment was violated by late evening and
early

morning music and disturbances coming from nearby premises
which the landlords leased to others for use as a bar or cocktail lounge
(lounge).

The judge further found that, although the landlords did not
intend to create the conditions, the landlords “had it within their control to
correct the

conditions which... amounted to a constructive eviction of
each (tenant).” He also found that the landlords promised each tenant to
correct the

situation, that the landlords made some attempt to remedy
the problem, but they were unsuccessful, and that each tenant vacated his
apartment

within a reasonable time. Judgment was entered for each
tenant; the landlords appealed; and we transferred the appeals here. We affirm
the

judgments.

The landlords argue that they did not violate the tenants’
implied covenant of quiet enjoyment because they are not chargeable with the

noise from the lounge. The landlords do not challenge the
judge’s conclusion that the noise emanating from the lounge was sufficient to

constitute a constructive eviction, if that noise could be
attributed to the landlords.^3 Nor do the landlords seriously argue that a
constructive

#650

eviction could not be found as matter of law because the
lounge was not on the same premises as the tenants’ apartments. See 1 American
Law of

Property § 3.51 at 281 (A. J. Casner ed. 1952). The
landlords’ principal contention, based on the denial of certain requests for
rulings, is that they

are not responsible for the conduct of the proprietors,
employees, and patrons of the lounge.

Our opinions concerning a constructive eviction by an
alleged breach of an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment sometimes have stated
that

the landlord must perform some act with the intent of
depriving the tenant of the enjoyment and occupation of the whole or part of
the leased

premises. See Katz v. Duffy, 158 N.E. 264 (Mass. 1927), and
cases cited. There are occasions, however, where a landlord has not intended to

violate a tenant’s rights, but there was nevertheless a
breach of the landlord’s covenant of quiet enjoyment which flowed as the
natural and

probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he
failed to do, or what he permitted to be done. Charles E. Burt, Inc. v. Seven
Grand Corp.,

163 N.E.2d 4, 6 (Mass. 1959) (failure to supply light, heat,
power, and elevator services). Westland Housing Corp. v. Scott, 44 N.E.2d 959,
962–

63 (Mass. 1942) (intrusions of smoke and soot over a
substantial period of time due to a defective boiler). Shindler v. Milden, 184
N.E. 673,

673–74 (Mass. 1933) (failure to install necessary heating
system, as agreed). Case v. Minot, 33 N.E. 700, 701 (Mass. 1893) (landlord
authorizing

another lessee to obstruct the tenant’s light and air,
necessary for the beneficial enjoyment of the demised premises). Skally v.
Shute, 132 Mass.

367, 3 70–371 (1882) (undermining of a leased building
rendering it unfit for occupancy). Although some of our opinions have spoken of

particular action or inaction by a landlord as showing a
presumed intention to evict, the landlord’s conduct, and not his intentions, is
controlling.

The judge was warranted in ruling that the landlords had it
within their control to correct the condition which caused the tenants to
vacate

their apartments. The landlords introduced a commercial
activity into an area where they leased premises for residential purposes. The
lease for

the lounge expressly provided that entertainment in the
lounge had to be conducted so that it could not be heard outside the building
and would

not disturb the residents of the leased apartments. The
potential threat to the occupants of the nearby apartments was apparent in the

circumstances. The landlords complained to the tenants of
the lounge after receiving numerous objections from residential tenants. From
time to

time, the pervading noise would abate in response to the
landlord’s complaints. We conclude that, as matter of law, the landlords had a
right to

control the objectionable noise coming from the lounge and
that the judge was warranted in finding as a fact that the landlords could
control the

objectionable conditions.

#651

This situation is different from the usual annoyance of one
residential tenant by another where traditionally the landlord has not been

chargeable with the annoyance. See Katz v. Duffy, 158 N.E.
264 (Mass. 1927) (illegal sale of alcoholic beverages); DeWitt v. Pierson, 112
Mass.

8 (1873) (prostitution).^4 Here we have a case more like
Case v. Minot, 33 N.E. 700 (Mass. 1893), where the landlord entered into a
lease with

one tenant which the landlord knew permitted that tenant to
engage in activity which would interfere with the rights of another tenant.
There, to

be sure, the clash of tenants’ rights was inevitable, if
each pressed those rights. Here, although the clash of tenants’ interests was
only a known

potentiality initially, experience demonstrated that a
decibel level for the entertainment at the lounge, acoustically acceptable to
its patrons and

hence commercially desirable to its proprietors, was
intolerable for the residential tenants.

Because the disturbing condition was the natural and
probable consequence of the landlords’ permitting the lounge to operate where
it did

and because the landlords could control the actions at the
lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises
which were

not reasonably habitable. Tenants such as these should not
be left only with a claim against the proprietors of the noisome lounge. To the
extent

that our opinions suggest a distinction between nonfeasance
by the landlord, which has been said to create no liability (P. Hall,
Massachusetts

Law of Landlord and Tenant §§ 90–91 (4th ed. 1949)), and
malfeasance by the landlord, we decline to perpetuate that distinction where
the

landlord creates a situation and has the right to control
the objectionable conditions.

Judgments affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

```



1 .The theory of constructive eviction builds on the
exception to independent covenants recognized for actual evictions by the
lessor. See



```

```



652



```

Smith v. McEnany, supra. Suppose the lessor commits some act
that falls short of an actual eviction but so severely depresses the value of
the tenancy

that the lessee has no reasonable option but to vacate the
premises. In these circumstances, is it not fair to say that the lessor has
constructively evicted

the lessee? And if the covenant to pay rent is dependent
rather than independent when the lessor actually evicts the lessee, shouldn’t
the covenant to pay

rent also be dependent when the lessor constructively evicts
the tenant? Upon this reasoning, courts concluded that lessor misfeasance
sufficiently

serious to cause a reasonable lessee to vacate was a
constructive eviction, and excused the lessee from further payment of rent.

2. _Blackett_ involves the considerably trickier issue of
   lessor nonfeasance rather than misfeasance. The noise from the lounge is being
   caused by

another tenant. The lessor is blamed for not stepping in and
forcing the lounge-tenant to hold down the noise. One theory for holding a
lessor

responsible for constructive eviction based on nonfeasance
turns on whether the lessor’s inaction violates some specific clause in the
lessee’s lease. For

example, suppose the lessor promises in the lease to provide
a “waterproof” basement. The basement leaks, and the lessor does nothing.
Courts have

held in these circumstances that the lessor’s failure to act
may constitute a constructive eviction (if the lessor’s breach otherwise causes
effects that

satisfy the severity requirements for constructive eviction
and the lessee vacates because of those effects), because the failure to act
was the breach of a

specific duty outlined in the lease. See Reste Realty Corp.
v. Cooper, 251 A. 2 d 268 (N.J. 1969 ). Is there a clause in the lessee’s lease
in _Blackett_ that

would justify a finding of constructive eviction under the
breach-of-lease-clause theory?

3 .How in fact does the court conclude that the lessor is
liable for nonfeasance in _Blackett_? Under what circumstances should a
lessor’s tenant A be

regarded as a third-party beneficiary of a clause in the
lease between the lessor and tenant B? Many of the earliest constructive
eviction cases involved

nonfeasance in the form of a lessor who did nothing to evict
prostitutes operating in a multi-unit building. See, e.g., Dyett v. Pendleton,
8 Cow. 727

(N.Y. 1826 ). Does the decision in the instant case rest on
a pun on the term “quiet enjoyment”?

4 .How critical is it to the theory of constructive eviction
that the lessee actually vacate the premises? On the one hand, since the theory
rests on an

analogy to actual eviction, one could say that it is
necessary that the lessee vacate the premises in order to establish
constructive eviction. On the other

hand, since the theory is designed to single out lessor
breaches that “depriv[e] the tenant of the enjoyment and occupation of the
whole or part of the

leased premises,” one could say that the lessee’s decision
to vacate is at most only evidence of the severity of the breach, but not a
necessary element of

the defense. Moreover, the requirement that the lessee
vacate puts the lessee at extreme risk if the court agrees with the lessor that
the conditions of the

premises were not sufficiently dire to justify constructive
eviction: The lessee could end up being liable for unpaid rent _and_ would have
given up

whatever value was left in the premises. One possible
solution would be to seek a declaratory judgment from a court before vacating,
see Charles E.

```

Burt, Inc. v. Seven Grand Corp., 163 N.E. 2 d 4 (Mass. 1959
), although this would be expensive and usually would take too long. Can you
see any

functional justification for requiring that the lessee
vacate before being allowed to invoke a defense that will eliminate all
liability for payment of rent?

See Echo Consulting Servs., Inc. v. North Conway Bank, 669
A. 2 d 227 (N.H. 1995 ) (adopting the so-far minority position that it is not
necessary for

lessee to vacate the premises to establish constructive
eviction). Compare the discussion in Chapter V about courts being less willing
to arbitrate

relations between cotenants while the relationship is
on-going than they are when one cotenant has been ousted or seeks partition.

5 .In the majority of jurisdictions that continue to require
that the lessee vacate in order to claim constructive eviction, disputes often
arise over

how quickly the tenant must vacate after the offending
conditions arise. The general standard is that a lessee must move out in a
reasonable time. See

Bloch v. Frischholz, 587 F. 3 d 771 , 778 ( 7 th Cir. 2009 )
(en banc) (“To establish a claim for constructive eviction, a tenant need not
move out the minute

the landlord’s conduct begins to render the dwelling
uninhabitable... Tenants have a reasonable time to vacate the premises.”);
Copeland v. Lincoln,

166 P. 3 d 245 , 247 (Colo. Ct. App. 2007 ) (lessee must
quit premises within a reasonable time to establish constructive eviction); R
& J Rhodes, LLC v.

Finney, 231 S.W. 3 d 183 , 189 (Mo. Ct. App. 2007 ) (failure
by lessee to abandon premises within a reasonable time waives a constructive
eviction claim).

In most states, the burden is on the lessee to show the
reasonableness and speed of her abandonment. See ARE– 100 / 800 / 801 Capitola,
LLC v. Triangle

Laboratories, Inc., 550 S.E. 2 d 31 , 35 (N.C. Ct. App. 2001
).

6. _Blackett_ alludes to the possibility of proving a
   partial constructive eviction, meaning, presumably, that the lessee has been
   constructively evicted

from one part of the premises but not from other parts. The
law here is unsettled, but there are some precedents upholding claims for
partial constructive

eviction. See Dennison v. Marlowe, 744 P. 2 d 906 (N.M. 1987
) (holding lessee could claim partial constructive eviction when lessor failed
to make the

second floor of restaurant habitable); East Haven Associates
v. Gurian, 313 N.Y.S. 2 d 927 (Civ. Ct. 1970 ) (holding that lessor’s failure
to eliminate

emission of green fluid from air conditioner and ash from
incinerator constituted partial constructive eviction from terrace outside
apartment). On the

reasoning of _Smith v. McEnany_ , supra, would a finding of
partial constructive eviction authorize the lessee to withhold all of the rent
until the partial

constructive eviction is corrected?

United States District Court, Eastern District of New York,
1994.



871 F.Supp. 147.



```

■
ORENSTEIN, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE: This action involves a dispute
arising from an alleged breach of a commercial ground lease,

dated August 15, 1991, between the landlord plaintiffs
Gotlieb and Blaymore, and tenant defendant Taco Bell Corporation (“Taco Bell”).

---

#654

The parties entered into a twenty year lease, effective
August 15, 1991, for the purpose of establishing a Taco Bell restaurant at
1532–54

86th Street, Brooklyn, New York. The lease provided that the
defendant was required to exercise diligence to obtain the necessary permits
and

administrative approvals to construct and operate the Taco
Bell restaurant on the premises. (Lease at ¶¶ 6, 69.) The defendant was
entitled to

cancel the lease if they were unable to obtain such permits
and administrative approval within a six month “permitting period,” ending on

February 15, 1992. (Lease , at ¶ 6.)

Sometime in September, 1991, local community and religious
groups began an organized effort to oppose the construction and operation of

the Taco Bell restaurant at the subject location, and
against fast-food establishments in the community generally.

This organized opposition included public demonstrations of
protest with placards, handbilling, and letter writing, telephone campaigns,
and

community meetings with local politicians. Taco Bell
attempted to assuage this community opposition by attending these meetings,
proposing

amendments to the design plans and suggesting alternative
measures to address the community group’s safety and environmental concerns.

During the intervening six month period, the Defendant
engaged the services of local attorneys and engineers in an effort to develop
plans

and a permit application. Nevertheless, defendant did not
file its permit application with the appropriate governmental entities until
February 14,

1992, one day prior to the expiration of the contractual
“permitting period” referred to in paragraph 6 of the lease.

Also on February 14, 1992, defendant served on plaintiffs a
written repudiation of the lease pursuant to Lease paragraph 6. Plaintiffs

rejected this repudiation also by letter dated February 14,
1992. The plaintiffs initiated the instant action in June, 1992. * * *

A lessor has numerous options when a lessee attempts to
repudiate a lease prior to the expiration of its term. See Centurian
Development

Ltd. v. Kenford Co., Inc., 400 N.Y.S.2d 263, 264 (App. Div.
1977). The landlord may reject the repudiation and do nothing, in which case
the

tenant continues to remain liable under the terms of the
lease, as there is no obligation for a commercial lessor to mitigate damages.
See Sage

Realty Corp. v. Kenbee Management-New York, Inc., 582
N.Y.S.2d 182 (App. Div. 1992); Mitchell Titus Assocs., Inc. v. Mesh Realty
Corp., 554

N.Y.S.2d 136 (App. Div. 1990); Syndicate Bldg. Corp. v.
Lorber, 512 N.Y.S.2d 674, 675 (App. Div. 1987) (this duty recently imposed on

residential landlords, however the contrary is true in the
context of commercial leases). The lessor could also elect to notify the tenant
that it was

entering the premises and re-letting for the tenant’s
benefit, in which case the tenant remains liable for any rent deficiency.
Underhill v. Collins,

30 N.E. 576 (N.Y. 1892). The lessor also has the option to
accept the repudiation, re-enter the premises and re-let for its own benefit.
In

#655

that event the lessee is generally relieved from any further
liability under the lease. See Herter v. Mullen, 53 N.E. 700, 701 (N.Y. 1899);

Centurian Development, 400 N.Y.S.2d at 264. No further rent
accrues because the landlord-tenant relationship no longer exists. See
Hermitage

Co. v. Levine, 162 N.E. 97, 98 (N.Y. 1928).

The defendant herein repudiated the lease by letter dated
February 14, 1992, sent in response to plaintiff’s letter dated February 14,
[1992].

Plaintiff’s letter rejected defendant’s February 10, 1992
request to alter the terms of the lease. The plaintiffs’ February 14, 1992
letter explicitly

stated that they would reject any attempt by the defendant
to repudiate the lease and informed the defendant that they would be held
liable under

the terms of the lease.

The extent of plaintiffs’ entitlement to damages therefore
turns upon whether the surrender and repudiation of the lease was accepted,

notwithstanding the assertions made in plaintiffs’ February
14, 1992 letter.

A.Acceptance of the Repudiation

Termination of an estate by repudiation or surrender may be
effected by express agreement or by operation of law, where it is inferred from

the conduct of the parties. Riverside Research Inst. v.
KMGA, Inc., 497 N.E.2d 669, 670–71 (N.Y. 1986); Gray v. Kaufman Dairy &
Ice-Cream

Co., 56 N.E. 903 (N.Y. 1900); Tootle Theater Co. v. Shubert
Theatrical Co., 162 N.Y.S. 1 1 1 (App. Div. 1916).

Acceptance of a surrender is created by operation of law
when the parties to a lease do some act so inconsistent with the
landlord-tenant

relationship which implies “their intent to deem the lease
terminated.” Riverside, 497 N.E.2d at 670. Such an implied acceptance of
surrender has

been found in “conduct by the landlord which fell short of
an actual re-letting but which indicated the landlord’s intent to terminate the
lease and

use the premises for his own benefit.” Centurian Development
Ltd. v. Kenford Co., Inc., 400 N.Y.S.2d 263, 264 (App. Div. 1977) ([citations

omitted]).

In addition, an outward refusal to accept repudiation of the
lease does not bar a finding that the subsequent conduct of the parties creates
an

acceptance by operation of law. See e.g., Gray, 56 N.E. at
904 (court found acceptance by operation of law where plaintiff refused
defendant’s

offer of surrender yet re-rented in his own name); Tootle
Theater, 162 N.Y.S. at 113 (“The fact that plaintiff refused to accept
surrender... does

not establish conclusively the absence of acceptance... [it
may be] implied from all the circumstances of the case”). Therefore it is of no

moment that the plaintiffs rejected the defendant’s
surrender and repudiation in February of 1992. * * *

Nevertheless, the testimony of plaintiff David Gotlieb at
the damages trial revealed that despite the plaintiffs’ rejection of the
defendant’s

repudiation and surrender, the plaintiffs negotiated and

#656

made a written offer to lease the premises for their sole
benefit to a prospective new tenant, Rite-Aid drug stores. Plaintiffs
originally referred the

representatives of Rite-Aid to Taco Bell for a possible
sub-let, yet apparently became impatient and initiated this effort to re-rent
the property for

their sole benefit.

On October 19, 1993, plaintiffs met directly with
representatives of the Rite-Aid corporation. At that meeting, the plaintiffs
and Rite-Aid

representatives discussed renting the subject premises.
Plaintiff Gotlieb testified that at that time he decided to deal directly with
Rite-Aid,

regardless of the consequences. Plaintiff Gotlieb testified:

A.After Lee [Blaymore] and I talked about it for a while, I
told him I felt that I had to consider negotiating directly with Rite-

Aid, let the chips fall where they may.... We were paying
out considerable expenses month after month and going absolutely

nowhere, and I felt it was time to make a decisive move.

A written proposal, dated November 3, 1993, with explicit
terms of a proposed lease was then submitted to Rite-Aid representatives.

Mere attempts to re-let are insufficient to establish an
acceptance by operation of law. See Levitt v. Zindler, 121 N.Y.S. 483 (App.
Div.

1910); Dorrance v. Bonesteel, 64 N.Y.S. 307 (App. Div.
1900). However, the testimony heard by this Court indicates that the
plaintiffs’ acts are

more than a mere attempt to re-let the premises to the
general public; plaintiff Gotlieb’s testimony, and the letter proposal sent to
Rite-Aid

representatives, unequivocally demonstrate the plaintiffs’
intent to accept the defendant’s surrender, re-enter the property and re-let it
for their

sole benefit. See Centurian Development, 400 N.Y.S.2d at
266. Plaintiffs’ actions were inconsistent with the tenant’s interest in the
property

* * *.

The Court finds that as a result of their affirmative
conduct, the plaintiffs accepted the defendant’s repudiation and surrender of
the lease by

operation of law between the October 19, 199 3, meeting and
the November 3, 1993 letter sent to the prospective tenant’s agent. Thus the
lease

was terminated as of November, 1993.

The Court acknowledges that paragraph 62 of the lease
contains a boilerplate provision which addresses acceptance of a surrender. The

provision acts to shield the landlord vis-a-vis acts by the
defendant such as the payment of lesser amounts of rent, or delivery of keys to
the

premises. Based upon the findings of this Court from the
testimony presented, this provision has no effect to shield the plaintiffs from
the

consequences of their own affirmative conduct to re-rent the
property for their sole benefit, which gives rise to an acceptance by operation
of law.

B.Rent

Plaintiffs [contend] they are entitled to all “base rent”
both past and future, due under lease paragraph 53(A). Plaintiffs also contend
they are

#657

entitled to the “additional rent,” both past and future, due
under lease paragraph 53(D). For the purposes of this discussion the term
“rent” refers

to both “base rent” and “additional rent” as defined in the
lease unless otherwise indicated.

1.Accrued Rent

Defendant has never paid any rent due under the lease.
Although the effective date of the lease was August 15, 1991, the defendant was
to

commence paying rent on June 15, 1992. (Lease ¶ 52(A)(iv).)
The defendant repudiated the lease on February 14, 1992, and therefore never

made any rent payments.

A lessee is obligated to pay rent even if the lessee chooses
not to occupy the premises. See Darob Holding Co. v. House of Pile Fabrics,

Inc., 310 N.Y.S.2d 418 (Civ. Ct. 1970). Based upon the
finding that the plaintiffs’ implied acceptance of the surrender took place as
of

November, 1993, and that the lease remained in effect until
that time, the defendants are liable for all rent due under the lease up to
November,

1993. The defendant was obligated to pay a “base rent” of
      $10,833.33 per month. (Lease at ¶¶ 53(A)(ii), 53(D).) Thus the defendant is
      liable for

base rent for sixteen and one-half (16.5) months, in the sum
of $178,749.95.

The defendant was also obligated to pay “additional rent”
including, but not limited to, real estate taxes, late charges of one percent
with

accrued interest, utility services, insurance, and other
fixed expenses. (Lease at ¶¶ 51, 53 (D), 61, 66, 68, 74.) Therefore the
defendant is liable for

“additional rent” to November 1993, in the amount of
$59,815.43, exclusive of interest. * * *

2.Future Rent

Plaintiffs seek an acceleration of all future rent due under
the lease. This Court finds there is no entitlement to rent beyond October,
1993,

because the plaintiffs accepted the defendant’s repudiation
and surrender of the lease. An acceptance of a surrender “operates to discharge
the

tenant from all liability for rent in the future.” Herter v.
Mullen, 53 N.E. 700, 701 (N.Y. 1899) (“After the surrender, there could be no
recovery

of rent, since the landlord could not have the use of the
premises and the stipulated rent at the same time.”).

Even if the plaintiffs herein merely sat idly by and allowed
the defendant to remain in breach, the plaintiffs still could not maintain an
action

for all future rent because the lease has no acceleration
clause. The only lease provision which might be considered an acceleration
clause is

paragraph 60(c), which provides in pertinent part:

Tenant... shall also pay Landlord as liquidated damages for
the failure of Tenant to observe and perform said Tenant’s covenants

herein contained, any deficiency between the rent hereby
and/or covenanted to be paid and the net amount, if any, of the rents collected

on account of the Lease or leases of the Demised Premises
for each month of the period which would

#658

otherwise have constituted the balance of the term of this
Lease.... Any such liquidated damages shall be paid in monthly

installments by Tenant on the rent day specified in this
lease and any suit brought to collect the amount of the deficiency for any
month

shall not prejudice in any way the rights of Landlord to
collect the deficiency of any subsequent month by a similar proceeding.

This is not an acceleration clause but a provision for
liquidated damages. See e.g. Anon Realty Assoc., L.P., v. Simmons Stanley Ltd.,
583

N.Y.S.2d 77 8, 780 (Sup. Ct. 1992) (same lease language). In
the absence of an acceleration clause no action may be brought for future rent.

Maflo Holding Corp. v. S.J. Blume, Inc., 127 N.E.2d 558, 561
(N.Y. 1955) ([citation omitted]).

What remains is an action for liquidated damages. * * *
However, plaintiffs have forfeited their right to all future rents as damages
because

plaintiffs terminated the lease. See Centurian Development,
400 N.Y.S.2d at 266 (finding tenant liable for rent only up to date where
surrender

accepted by operation of law); Benderson v. Poss, 530
N.Y.S.2d 362, 363 (App. Div. 1988) (limiting landlord’s liquidated damage
recovery to

unpaid charges accrued up to landlord’s termination of
lease).

Moreover, to recover liquidated damages in the event of a
breach, the amount must bear a reasonable relation to the probable loss, and
the

amount of actual loss must be incapable or difficult of
precise estimation. Truck Rent-A-Center v. Puritan Farms 2nd, 361 N.E.2d 1015,
1018

(N.Y. 1977). Here, plaintiffs are negotiating a new lease of
the property at a higher rent than that contracted with the defendant. If the
plaintiffs

are awarded all future rents the result would be “grossly
disproportionate to the probable loss.” Puritan Farms , 361 N.E.2d at 1018. In
fact, a

windfall would be the most likely result. Therefore, the
plaintiffs are not entitled to future rents under the lease as liquidated
damages. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The doctrine of surrender, like the doctrine of
constructive eviction, is pro-lessee. When a court finds that the lessor has
accepted a surrender,

the lessee is liable for the full amount of rent owed up to
the moment of acceptance, but is off the hook thereafter. The doctrine is based
on the idea of a

contractual release of liability. The lessor and lessee
create a leasehold interest by entering into a lease between themselves. They
can extinguish such an

interest by agreeing between themselves to release each
other from the obligations of the lease. Ordinarily, such a release would
require a written

contract under the Statute of Frauds (if the lease were for
more than one year). The surrender doctrine emerged as courts reasoned that the
lessor and

lessee could create a mutual release by _implied contract_.
This would happen if the lessee vacated the premises with the intention never
to return, in

effect making an “offer” to surrender the leasehold estate,
and the lessor responded by taking action inconsistent with the lessor’s
continuing right to

```



659



```

the leasehold interest, in effect “accepting” the surrender
of the leasehold estate. Although originally grounded in the idea of
contractual release, the

doctrine of surrender eventually came to be understood as a
type of release implied as a matter of law. This means, among other things,
that the “offer”

and “acceptance” of the surrender do not have to be in
writing, notwithstanding the Statute of Frauds.

2 .The doctrine of surrender requires that courts
characterize both the actions of the lessor and the lessee as evidencing a
particular state of mind.

The lessee’s state of mind must be to abandon the leasehold.
This is usually pretty straightforward, although occasionally it can be
disputed (see _Berg v.

Wiley_ in Chapter IV for an example of a factual dispute
over whether the lessee has abandoned). The lessor’s state of mind must be to
“accept” the

abandonment, and reclaim the leasehold interest as an
entitlement belonging to the lessor. This gives rise to many more disputes.
Reasonably clear cases

are when the lessor changes the locks, thereby excluding the
lessee from further possession, or relets to a third person who enters into
possession. But

there is significant litigation over whether more equivocal
actions, such as retaining the keys after they have been dropped off by the
lessee or entering

the premises to put up a “For Rent” sign, constitute an
acceptance of surrender. See 2 Milton R. Friedman, Friedman on Leases § 16 : 3
: 2 (Andrew R.

Berman, ed. & rev., 6 th ed. 2017 ). In _Gotlieb_ , the
lessors write a letter to Taco Bell explicitly stating that they will not
accept a repudiation of the lease.

What should they have done differently to avoid the
conclusion they had in fact accepted a surrender by the lessee?

3 .The court notes that under New York law a commercial
lessor has three options when a lessee abandons: ( 1 ) do nothing and sue for
accrued

rent; ( 2 ) relet as the “agent” of the lessee; or ( 3 )
accept the lessee’s surrender and relet for the lessor’s benefit. (New York
courts, as the decision

indicates, have rejected a duty to mitigate damages in the
context of commercial leases.) The _Restatement_ is in accord with this
statement of landlord

options. Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and
Tenant § 12. 1 ( 2 ). (The _Restatement_ also rejects the duty to mitigate—for
both residential and

commercial leases.) The first option is not very appealing
for the lessor if the lessee is struggling financially or has no assets to
satisfy a judgment for

unpaid rent. Also, if the premises stand empty this may
invite vandalism or cause the value of other related property owned by the
lessor to deteriorate.

The second option is more appealing to lessors. Many leases
include clauses that allow the lessor to reenter and relet the premises as the
“agent of” the

lessee, and New York (like the _Restatement_ ) gives lessors
this option as a matter of law. Under this option the lessor can seek a new
lessee and sue the

abandoning lessee for damages equal to any benefit of the
bargain under the original lease which has been lost. For example, if the
lessor reenters and

advertises the premises, but three months go by before a
suitable substitute lessee is found, the original lessee will remain liable for
an additional three

months’ rent (in addition to any unpaid rent up to the time
of abandonment). How does a court tell whether a lessor is reletting for the
lessee’s account

or has accepted the lessee’s offer to surrender and is
renting for the lessor’s account? Should the lessors in _Gotlieb_ have written
to Taco Bell advising

that

```



660



```

they were reletting for Taco Bell’s account? Might they have
recovered higher damages if they had done so?

4 .Another lease clause lessors sometimes use to protect
themselves in the event of a lessee default is a rent acceleration clause,
which purports to

make all of the rent owing under the lease immediately due.
Courts have tended to take a dim view of these clauses, perhaps influenced by
the

traditional understanding that “the rent issues out of the
land.” See Smith v. McEnany, supra. This suggests the lease is a conveyance of
an interest in

land, and that the obligation to pay rent arises from the
right to possession of the land, and therefore cannot be treated as a
contractual obligation

independent of the right of possession. As courts have begun
to treat leases more like bilateral contracts, acceleration clauses have been
viewed with less

hostility, although usually on the understanding that the
lessor has a duty to mitigate damages under such a clause. See Aurora Business
Park Assoc. v.

Michael Albert, Inc., 548 N.W. 2 d 153 (Iowa 1996 )
(upholding acceleration clause in conjunction with duty to mitigate as simply
assuring that the lessor

is made whole). Some jurisdictions, however, continue to
refuse to enforce acceleration clauses if they are deemed to be an excessive
liquidated

damages penalty. See, e.g., NPS, LLC v. Minihane, 886 N.E. 2
d 670 , 675 (Mass. 2008 ) (upholding an accelerated rent clause as a reasonable
form of

liquidated damages); Cummings Properties, LLC v. National
Communications Corp., 869 N.E. 2 d 617 , 621 – 22 (Mass. 2007 ) (upholding an
acceleration

clause in a commercial lease, so long as it was not a
penalty). Do you agree with the court in _Gotlieb_ that the clause the lessors
assert to be an

acceleration clause is really a provision for liquidated
damages?

d.THE MODEL OF DEPENDENT COVENANTS

The 1970s witnessed a “revolution” in lease law, a
revolution that was characterized at the time as entailing the repudiation of
the

“property” conception of leases in favor of a “contract”
model of leases. There is reason to be somewhat skeptical of this
characterization. As we

have seen, lease law has always had a strong contractual
flavor, in the sense that leases are regarded as bundles of covenants.
Moreover, some of

the reforms of the 1970s are difficult to square with
ordinary precepts of contract law, insofar as they entailed the adoption of
mandatory rules of

law rather than default rules (default rules are more
typical in the law of contracts). See Roger A. Cunningham, The New and
Statutory

Warranties of Habitability in Residential Leases: From
Contract to Status, 16 Urb. L. Ann. 3 (1979); Mary Ann Glendon, The

movement accelerated in the 1970s, it was clearly foreshadowed by

earlier decisions, such as the following case, which
anticipated in many respects what can be called modern lease law.

■
CURTIS, J. Plaintiff brought this suit for rent alleged to be due under a lease

* * * A trial was had before the court without a jury, and findings

were made in favor of the defendant pursuant to its claim
that plaintiff’s breach of a restrictive covenant in the lease, which violation
was not

waived by the defendant, prevented the maintenance of this
action * * *. From the judgment rendered accordingly for defendant * * *
plaintiff

has taken this appeal.

On July 1, 1934, defendant, Horton & Converse, as
lessee, entered into a written lease covering certain space on the ground floor
of the

Medico-Dental Building at Eighth and Francisco Streets, Los
Angeles, for a term of sixteen years and four months, at a minimum monthly
rental

of $600 for the part of the term concerned herein, and a
fixed percentage of the gross sales. At the time the lease was made, defendant
was in

possession of the premises, having occupied them since 1925
under a prior lease. As successor in interest by virtue of an assignment of the
lease

involved herein, plaintiff, Medico-Dental Building Company,
stands in the position of the original lessor.

The lease provided that the premises should be “used and
occupied by lessee as a drug store and for no other business or purpose,
without

the written consent of lessor.” It also contained the
following stipulation: “Lessor agrees not to lease or sublease any part or
portion of the

Medico-Dental Building to any other person, firm or
corporation for the purpose of maintaining a drug store or selling drugs or
ampoules, or for

the purpose of maintaining a cafe, restaurant or lunch
counter therein during the term of this lease.”

On December 30, 1937 , plaintiff leased the entire ninth
floor of the same building to one Dr. Boonshaft, a physician, for a term of
three

years commencing April 15, 1938. This lease contained the
following provisions: “The premises demised hereby are to be used solely as
offices

for the practice of medicine and dentistry, and lessee
agrees that he will not maintain therein or thereon, nor permit to be
maintained therein or

thereon, a drug store or drug dispensary, nor will lessee
compound or dispense, or permit to be compounded or dispensed, drugs or
ampoules

except in connection with the regular course of treatment of
lessee’s own patients. Lessee agrees not to display any sign or advertisement
on the

inside or outside of the demised premises, or the building
of which the demised premises are a part embodying the words ‘Pharmacy,’ ‘Drug

Store,’ ‘Dispensary’ or words of like import. Lessee
understands that

#662

lessor has heretofore executed a lease to Horton &
Converse granting to said Horton & Converse the exclusive privilege of
conducting a drug

store business on the ground floor of said Medico-Dental
Building, and lessee agrees that he will not do, or permit to be done, anything
in

connection with the premises demised hereby which would in
any way conflict with or constitute a breach by the lessor therein of said
Horton &

Converse lease.”

Dr. Boonshaft went into possession under his lease on April
15, 1938, and occupied the entire ninth floor of the building, where he had
from

thirty-two to thirty-six treatment rooms and had six to
eight doctors associated with him in an organization known as the Boonshaft
Medical

Group. Independent of this staff but subject to frequent
call to the premises in the course of the work of this enterprise were some
thirty

consultant doctors. The plan of operation of the medical
organization was to register groups of employees and lodge members and their
families

for medical treatment on the basis of a monthly charge per
family; registration and payment of the fixed sum entitled the patient to
receive,

among other things, certain drugs, but additional charges
were made for other medicines. Dr. Boonshaft maintained a drug room wherein
drugs

were sold and prescriptions filled per the order of the
regular staff or the consultant doctors in the treatment of patients of the
Medical Group. He

obtained a pharmacy license on May 10, 1938. Until June 25
of that year he bought his drugs from defendant’s store in the building.
However, he

objected to the sales tax charged in connection with such
purchases, and on June 25, 1938 , he commenced buying wholesale from
defendant’s

wholesale department at another location, which source of
supply he continued to patronize to the time of trial. * * *

[T]he trial court found that plaintiff by executing the
lease with Dr. Boonshaft did demise a part of the Medico-Dental Building to a
tenant

other than defendant for the purpose of maintaining a drug
store and selling drugs on the premises, and that the making of the lease with
Dr.

Boonshaft was a breach of defendant’s lease; that plaintiff
in not taking immediate action to abate the drug store on the ninth floor of
the building

violated its lease with defendant; that plaintiff breached
its lease with defendant on August 19, 1938, when it advised defendant that it
could

make no arrangements with Dr. Boonshaft and could not do
anything with him regarding the selling of drugs and the maintaining of the
drug

store; and that such breaches of the lease were in material
respects and were not waived by defendant.

The court also found that a material part of the
consideration which induced defendant to enter into the lease with plaintiff
was the right to

be protected against competition, and that a material part
of the consideration failed as the result of plaintiff’s execution of the
Boonshaft lease.

---

On this appeal from the judgment rendered for defendant in
consequence of the above findings, plaintiff advances the following

#663

propositions: (1) Covenants in leases are independent and
performance of a covenant by the landlord is not a condition precedent to an
action for

rent against the tenant; (2) a covenant “not to lease” for a
restricted purpose is breached only by actual leasing for such purpose, or by

acquiescence in the conduct of the second lessee which is in
violation of the restriction, neither of which appears in this case; (3) even
if the

covenants are dependent and there was a breach of the
covenant involved herein, the breach was not so substantial as to go to the
whole of the

consideration; and (4) there was a waiver by the defendant
of the alleged violation. Consideration of the legal aspect of these respective

contentions in conjunction with the factual situation which
confronted the trial court will demonstrate the propriety of the judgment
entered.

The first controversial point is whether the covenants “not
to lease” and “to pay rent” are mutually independent or dependent. It is
plaintiff’s

position that a lease is a conveyance as distinguished from
a contract, so that any covenant on the part of the lessor is independent of
the lessee’s

obligation to pay rent and each party has his remedy for
breach of covenant in an action for damages. While it is true that a lease is
primarily a

conveyance in that it transfers an estate to the lessee, it
also presents the aspect of a contract. (Pollock on Contracts, Third Am. ed.,
p. 531.) This

dual character serves to create two distinct sets of rights
and obligations—“one comprising those growing out of the relation of landlord
and

tenant, and said to be based on the ‘privity of estate,’ and
the other comprising those growing out of the express stipulations of the
lease, and so

said to be based on ‘privity of contract.’ ” (Samuels v.
Ottinger, 146 P. 638, 638–39 (Cal. 1915).) Those features of the lease which
are strictly

contractual in their nature should be construed according to
the rules for the interpretation of contracts generally and in conformity with
the

fundamental principle that the intentions of the parties
should be given effect as far as possible. In line with this concept is the
authoritative

observation in 32 Am.Jur. § 144, p. 145, that “covenants and
stipulations on the part of the lessor and lessee are to be construed to be
dependent

upon each other or independent of each other, according to
the intention of the parties and the good sense of the case, and technical
words should

give way to such intention.”

Noteworthy here are the several provisions of the lease
itself plainly indicating the intention and understanding of the parties as to
the

interbalancing considerations existing between the
respective covenants. The agreement by the lessor “not to lease” any other part
of the building

to any other person for the purpose of its use as a drug
store or for the sale of drugs, and the agreement by the lessee “to pay rent”
appear in a

rider attached to and made a part of the lease, a
circumstance of incorporation not to be overlooked in the measure of the
parties’ comprehension

of the reciprocal nature of the specified promises.
Moreover, the lessee was limited by the terms of the lease to maintaining a
drug store, a

restriction emphasizing the import of the lessor’s duty in

#664

negotiating future demises of other portions of the
building. Finally to be noted is the express language of the lease manifesting
the conditional

character of the stipulations therein contained: “Time is of
the essence of this lease and all of the terms and covenants hereof are
conditions, and

upon the breach by lessee of any of the same lessor may, at
lessor’s option, terminate this lease... .” Thus, the parties recognized in
plain terms

the essential interdependence of their obligations.

It is an established rule that those covenants which run to
the entire consideration of a contract are mutual and dependent. Undoubtedly
the

restrictive covenant in defendant’s lease was of such a
nature. The exclusive right to conduct a drug store in the building was vital
to defendant’s

successful operation of its business under the circumstances
which prevailed in this case. Defendant’s pharmacy was of a distinctive type in
that

it catered principally to doctors and dentists for reference
of prescription work, did not carry the general line of merchandise found in
the

ordinary drug store, and did not rely upon transient trade.
Defendant was and had been maintaining a chain of exclusive prescription
pharmacies

in Los Angeles for eighteen years. The fact that the
Medico-Dental Building was tenanted for the most part by practitioners of the
medical and

dental professions motivated defendant to select that
location for the establishment of one of its retail units. Defendant had
occupied the same

premises since 1925, and depended upon the tenants of the
building and their patients for the major portion of its business. In fact,
when

vacancies occurred defendant’s income from the store
suffered to such an extent that the rent was temporarily reduced, and
restoration to the

former monthly rental level was made contingent upon a
material increase in the occupancy of the building. Thus plaintiff knew, as
appears from

its letter granting the rent concession to defendant, that
the “chief source” of defendant’s business on the premises was the tenants in
the building,

and that it was therefore of prime importance that no
competitor be rented quarters there. The correlation of these facts with the
express

provisions of the lease above noted compels the conclusion
that the restrictive covenant was not incidental or subordinate to the main
object of

the lease, but went to the whole of the consideration, and
that as such it must be deemed a dependent covenant. * * *

The second question is whether the restrictive covenant was
breached by leasing for the prohibited purpose or by the lessor’s acquiescence

in the conduct of the other lessee amounting to a violation
of the restriction.

As to the first part of this question, relative to leasing
for the forbidden purpose, the trial court found that plaintiff did lease a
portion of the

Medico-Dental Building to Dr. Boonshaft for the purpose of
maintaining a drug store and selling drugs on the premises so demised; that, by

executing such lease, plaintiff breached its agreement with
defendant; and that, by virtue of one of the provisions of the lease with Dr.
Boonshaft,

plaintiff intended to and did give such tenant the right

#665

and privilege of maintaining a drug store, selling drugs and
compounding prescriptions on the premises, and by so doing failed to protect
the

defendant against competition.

This finding, as to the purpose of plaintiff’s demise to Dr.
Boonshaft, was based undoubtedly upon inferences drawn from the provisions of

that tenant’s lease; inferences that plaintiff knew at the
time such lease was executed that the Boonshaft Medical Group contemplated the
conduct

of a type of medical business which would require a large
stock of drugs, and that a drug store would be operated in connection
therewith; that

Dr. Boonshaft regarded the privilege of maintaining a drug
store as a material part of the consideration in support of his lease; and
inferences

drawn from the conduct of plaintiff and Dr. Boonshaft
following the latter’s entry into possession of the demised premises. * * *

As to the second part of the second question—whether the
restrictive covenant was breached by the plaintiff’s acquiescence in the
conduct

of Dr. Boonshaft amounting to a violation of the
restriction—the trial court found that the plaintiff in not taking immediate
action to abate the

drug store on the ninth floor and in advising defendant that
it could not do anything with Dr. Boonshaft with respect to the objectionable
activity,

breached its lease with defendant.

Bearing on this feature of the case is the following
evidence. The drug store on the ninth floor was opened in May, 1938. In the
latter part of

July, 1938, defendant learned that Dr. Boonshaft was
maintaining a pharmacy on the premises, and on August 3, 1938, it wrote a
letter to plaintiff

protesting against the competing activity and demanding that
plaintiff immediately put a stop to such objectionable practice. All of the
parties

concerned met in conference in defendant’s office five days
later, with the result that plaintiff promised to see what arrangements could
be made

and to advise defendant. Communications were thereupon had
between plaintiff and Dr. Boonshaft, but defendant did not hear further from

plaintiff until August 19, 1938, when plaintiff’s attorney
advised Mr. Horton, defendant’s president, by telephone that he had been unable
to do

anything with Dr. Boonshaft, that “there could not be any
arrangements made,” and Mr. Horton then said that he thought the premises would
be

vacated, to which the attorney replied: “Use your own
judgment about that.”

From this summarization of the pertinent facts it appears
that defendant did not precipitately vacate the premises upon learning in the
latter

part of July, 1938, that the competing drug store was being
operated, but followed a reasonable and deliberate course of action designed to
afford

plaintiff an opportunity to adjust the controversy in a
manner consistent with the rights and obligations of the parties. * * *

[T]he findings of the trial court relative to acquiescence
have ample support in the evidence, and the conclusion is required that
plaintiff

concurred in Dr. Boonshaft’s maintenance of his drug store
in the building.

#666

The third point, that even if there was a breach of the
restrictive covenant, it was not so substantial as to go to the whole of the

consideration, was discussed in part in connection with the
treatment of the first proposition concerning the interdependence of the
parties’

covenants under the terms of the lease. * * * [I]t is
apparent that the exclusive right to engage in a specified business in a
particular building was

the essence of the consideration for defendant’s payment of
rent during its many years of occupancy of the premises. * * * [W]here, as
here, the

covenant of the lessor is of such character that its breach
will defeat the entire object of the lessee in entering into the lease, such as
rendering his

further occupancy of the premises a source of continuing
financial loss incapable of satisfactory measurement in damages, it must be
held that

the covenant goes to the root of the consideration for the
lease upon the lessee’s part. (University Club v. Deakin, 106 N.E. 790 (Ill.
1914); Hiatt

Investment Co. v. Buehler 16 S.W.2d 219 (Mo. App. 1929).)
Commensurate with this principle, it is plain that the defendant’s loss of
potential

business on account of the competing drug store was not a
matter easily susceptible of monetary estimate, and proof of this element was
not

required of defendant under its presentation of the rights
and duties of the parties in the circumstances of this case. A contrary view
would

authorize plaintiff to execute instruments similar to the
Boonshaft lease for every floor of its building and thus render the restrictive
covenant in

defendant’s lease valueless insofar as the protection of its
essential source of income was concerned.

In the case of Hiatt Investment Co. v. Buehler , supra,
where * * * the lessor’s breach of a restrictive covenant similar to the one
here

involved did not permit its recovery in an action for rent,
the court observed at pp. 163–164: “Defendant herein had a choice of several
remedies:

(1) He could rescind the lease, in which case he would not
have been required to pay any further rent; (2) He could have continued under
his

lease and at the end of the term sued for loss of the
profits suffered by reason of the competition of the Crown Drug Company; (3) He
could have

treated the violation of the covenant by the plaintiff as
putting an end to the contract for purposes of the performance and sued for
damages.”

Defendant elected to pursue the first course, and in this
case the state of the record showing plaintiff’s departure in substance from
its contractual

obligation establishes the propriety of defendant’s position
in accord with its choice of available relief. * * *

For the foregoing reasons the judgment is affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1. _Medico-Dental_ is the clearest example we have seen yet
   of how leases can function as a mechanism for the governance of a complex of
   assets,

as well as a financing or risk-spreading device. The
Medico-Dental building is conceived of as a commercial office building devoted
exclusively to

offices for doctors and dentists. The retail space on the
ground floor is rented to a

```



667



```

pharmacy. This arrangement is obviously to the benefit of
the pharmacy-tenant, since many patients will stop by to fill prescriptions
after leaving the

doctors’ and dentists’ offices. But it is also of benefit to
the doctors and dentists, insofar as the pharmacy serves the convenience of
their patients and

makes it more likely they will continue to patronize doctors
and dentists in the building. The arrangement also poses a potential for
conflict, as the case

reveals. Such conflicts would ordinarily be resolved by the
lessor, either through the lessor’s drafting of appropriate lease provisions,
or its enforcement

of these provisions, or its attempt to negotiate compromises
or solutions among lessees. When these efforts fail, one or more lessees may
walk out, and

litigation may result, as in the principal case. Given the
complicated collective-governance questions involved, it is probably no
accident that the court

was drawn to the more flexible precepts of contract law,
rather than simple exclusion postulates of property law, in resolving the
dispute.

2. _Medico-Dental_ suggests that many disputes that arise
   under leases can be resolved by applying, in a fairly straightforward fashion,
   the general

rules of contract law that apply to bilateral commercial
contracts. A breach by one party, here the lessor, gives rise to a variety of
remedial options for

the other party, here the lessee. If the breach is
sufficiently serious—if it goes to the essence of the consideration under the
lease or is sufficiently

material—then the options for the promisee (whether it be
the lessor or the lessee) include rescission of the lease and termination of
further performance

by the promisee. If the breach involves a less serious
covenant—one that does not go to the essence of the bargain or is not
sufficiently material to

justify rescission—then the promisee would be entitled to
sue for damages only. The result would be, in effect, that major breaches would
be treated

under a model of dependent covenants, whereas minor breaches
would continue to be handled under a model of independent covenants.

3 .Under the dependent covenants model of _Medico-Dental_ ,
does the doctrine of constructive eviction have any continuing role to play?
Consider

in this regard _Wesson v. Leone Enterprises, Inc._ , 774
N.E. 2 d 611 (Mass. 2002 ). The lessee, a financial printing company,
complained repeatedly to the

lessor about roof leaks. The leaks caused the lessee to
cover some of its machinery and supplies with plastic tarps to protect them
from water damage,

but did not cause any suspension of business activity. The
lessee vacated the premises two years before the end of the lease term, citing
the roof leaks as

the reason. The lessor sued for unpaid rent. The
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held on these facts that the roof leaks
were not a constructive

eviction, because they did not make the property
“untenantable for the purposes for which they were used.” However, the court
also concluded that

under the lease, the lessor was responsible to maintain and
repair the roof. Adopting the rule of mutually dependent covenants, the court
held that the

lessor’s breach of the covenant to repair deprived the
lessee of a “substantial benefit significant to the purpose of the lease” and
hence justified the lessee

in terminating the lease. The lessee was also awarded
relocation costs. After this decision, when if ever would a lessee need to
invoke constructive

eviction in Massachusetts?

```



668



```

4 .How would the dependent covenants model of
_Medico-Dental_ apply to a typical month-to-month residential tenancy, perhaps
under an oral

lease? Would the lessor’s duties toward the lessee continue
to be defined by the common-law rule of caveat lessee, as reflected in _Sutton
v. Temple_? If

so, then the new model would offer residential lessees
little relief, unless they had the foresight (and the bargaining power) to
insist on specific promises

in the lease guaranteeing a minimal standard of quality.
Perhaps for this reason, courts beginning in the late 1960 s began to turn to a
different contractual

idea—that of the implied warranty of habitability—in
addressing conditions of minimal quality standards in residential leases.

United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia
Circuit, 1970.



428 F. 2 d 1071.



```

■ J.
SKELLY WRIGHT, CIRCUIT JUDGE: These cases present the question whether housing
code violations which arise during the term of a lease have

any effect upon the tenant’s obligation to pay rent. The
Landlord and Tenant Branch of the District of Columbia Court of General
Sessions ruled

proof of such violations inadmissible when proffered as a
defense to an eviction action for nonpayment of rent. The District of Columbia
Court

of Appeals upheld this ruling.

Because of the importance of the question presented, we
granted appellants’ petitions for leave to appeal. We now reverse and hold that
a

warranty of habitability, measured by the standards set out
in the Housing Regulations for the District of Columbia, is implied by
operation of

law into leases of urban dwelling units covered by those
Regulations and that breach of this warranty gives rise to the usual remedies
for breach

of contract.

I

The facts revealed by the record are simple. By separate
written leases, each of the appellants rented an apartment in a three-building

apartment complex in Northwest Washington known as Clifton
Terrace. The landlord, First National Realty Corporation, filed separate
actions in

the Landlord and Tenant Branch of the Court of General
Sessions on April 8, 1966, seeking possession on the ground that each of the
appellants

had defaulted in the payment of rent due for the month of
April. The tenants, appellants here, admitted that they had not paid the
landlord any

rent for April. However, they alleged numerous violations of
the Housing Regulations as “an equitable defense or (a) claim by way of

recoupment or set-off in an amount equal to the rent claim,”
as provided in the rules of the Court of General Sessions. They offered to
prove

[t]hat there are approximately 1500 violations of the
Housing Regulations of the District of Columbia in the building at Clifton

Terrace, where Defendant resides some affecting the premises

#669

of this Defendant directly, others indirectly, and all
tending to establish a course of conduct of violation of the Housing
Regulations to

the damage of Defendants * * *

Appellants conceded at trial, however, that this offer of
proof reached only violations which had arisen since the term of the lease had

commenced. The Court of General Sessions refused appellants’
offer of proof and entered judgment for the landlord. The District of Columbia

Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the argument made by
appellants that the landlord was under a contractual duty to maintain the
premises in

compliance with the Housing Regulations.

II

Since, in traditional analysis, a lease was the conveyance
of an interest in land, courts have usually utilized the special rules
governing real

property transactions to resolve controversies involving
leases. However, as the Supreme Court has noted in another context, “the body
of private

property law * * * , more than almost any other branch of
law, has been shaped by distinctions whose validity is largely historical.”
Courts have a

duty to reappraise old doctrines in the light of the facts
and values of contemporary life—particularly old common law doctrines which the
courts

themselves created and developed. As we have said before,
“The continued vitality of the common law * * * depends upon its ability to
reflect

contemporary community values and ethics.”

#670

The assumption of landlord-tenant law, derived from feudal
property law, that a lease primarily conveyed to the tenant an interest in land

may have been reasonable in a rural, agrarian society; it
may continue to be reasonable in some leases involving farming or commercial
land. In

these cases, the value of the lease to the tenant is the
land itself. But in the case of the modern apartment dweller, the value of the
lease is that it

gives him a place to live. The city dweller who seeks to
lease an apartment on the third floor of a tenement has little interest in the
land 30 or 40

feet below, or even in the bare right to possession within
the four walls of his apartment. When American city dwellers, both rich and
poor, seek

“shelter” today, they seek a well known package of goods and
services—a package which includes not merely walls and ceilings, but also

adequate heat, light and ventilation, serviceable plumbing
facilities, secure windows and doors, proper sanitation, and proper
maintenance. * * *

Some courts have realized that certain of the old rules of
property law governing leases are inappropriate for today’s transactions. In
order to

reach results more in accord with the legitimate
expectations of the parties and the standards of the community, courts have
been gradually

introducing more modern precepts of contract law in
interpreting leases.^11 Proceeding piecemeal has, however, led to confusion
where “decisions

are frequently conflicting, not because of a healthy
disagreement on social policy, but because of the lingering impact of rules
whose policies are

long since dead.”^12

In our judgment the trend toward treating leases as
contracts is wise and well considered. Our holding in this case reflects a
belief that

leases of urban dwelling units should be interpreted and
construed like any other contract.

III

Modern contract law has recognized that the buyer of goods
and services in an industrialized society must rely upon the skill and honesty
of

the supplier to assure that goods and services purchased are
of adequate quality. In interpreting most contracts, courts have sought to
protect the

legitimate expectations of the buyer and have steadily
widened the seller’s responsibility for the quality of goods and services
through implied

warranties of fitness and merchantability. * * *

The rigid doctrines of real property law have tended to
inhibit the application of implied warranties to transactions involving real
estate.

Now, however, courts have begun to hold sellers and
developers of real property responsible for the quality of their product. For
example,

builders of new homes have recently been held liable to
purchasers for improper construction on the ground that the builders had
breached an

#671

implied warranty of fitness. In other cases courts have held
builders of new homes liable for breach of an implied warranty that all local
building

regulations had been complied with. And following the
developments in other areas, very recent decisions and commentary suggest the
possible

extension of liability to parties other than the immediate
seller for improper construction of residential real estate.

Despite this trend in the sale of real estate, many courts
have been unwilling to imply warranties of quality, specifically a warranty of

habitability, into leases of apartments. Recent decisions
have offered no convincing explanation for their refusal; rather they have
relied without

discussion upon the old common law rule that the lessor is
not obligated to repair unless he covenants to do so in the written lease
contract.

However, the Supreme Courts of at least two states, in
recent and well reasoned opinions, have held landlords to implied warranties of
quality in

housing leases. Lemle v. Breeden, 462 P.2d 470 (Haw. 1969);
Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper, 251 A.2d 268 (N.J. 1969). In our judgment, the
old

no-repair rule cannot coexist with the obligations imposed
on the landlord by a typical modern housing code, and must be abandoned in
favor of

an implied warranty of habitability. In the District of
Columbia, the standards of this warranty are set out in the Housing
Regulations.

IV

A.In our judgment the common law itself must recognize the
landlord’s obligation to keep his premises in a habitable condition. This

conclusion is compelled by three separate considerations.
First, we believe that the old rule was based on certain factual assumptions
which are

no longer true; on its own terms, it can no longer be
justified. Second, we believe that the consumer protection cases discussed
above require that

the old rule be abandoned in order to bring residential
landlord-tenant law into harmony with the principles on which those cases rest.
Third, we

think that the nature of today’s urban housing market also
dictates abandonment of the old rule.

The common law rule absolving the lessor of all obligation
to repair originated in the early Middle Ages.^30 Such a rule was perhaps well

suited to an agrarian economy; the land was more
important^31 than whatever small living structure was included in the
leasehold, and the tenant

farmer was fully capable of making repairs himself. These

#672

historical facts were the basis on which the common law
constructed its rule; they also provided the necessary prerequisites for its
application.^33

Court decisions in the late 1800’s began to recognize that
the factual assumptions of the common law were no longer accurate in some

cases. For example, the common law, since it assumed that
the land was the most important part of the leasehold, required a tenant to pay
rent

even if any building on the land was destroyed.^34 Faced
with such a rule and the ludicrous results it produced, in 1863 the New York
Court of

Appeals declined to hold that an upper story tenant was
obliged to continue paying rent after his apartment building burned down. The
court

simply pointed out that the urban tenant had no interest in
the land, only in the attached building. * * *

Another line of cases created an exception to the no-repair
rule for short term leases of furnished dwellings. The Massachusetts Supreme

Judicial Court, a court not known for its willingness to
depart from the common law, supported this exception, pointing out:

* * * [A] different rule should apply to one who hires a
      furnished room, or a furnished house, for a few days, or a few weeks or

months. Its fitness for immediate use of a particular kind,
as indicated by its appointments, is a far more important element entering

into the contract than when there is a mere lease of real
estate. One who lets for a short term a house provided with all furnishings and

appointments for immediate residence may be supposed to
contract in reference to a well-understood purpose of the hirer to use it as a

habitation. * * * It would be unreasonable to hold, under
such circumstances, that the landlord does not impliedly agree that what he is

letting is a house suitable for occupation in its condition
at the time. * * *^37

These as well as other similar cases demonstrate that some
courts began some time ago to question the common law’s assumptions that the

land was the most important feature of a leasehold and that
the tenant could feasibly make any necessary repairs himself. Where those

assumptions no longer reflect contemporary housing patterns,
the courts have created exceptions to the general rule that landlords have no
duty

to keep their premises in repair.

It is overdue for courts to admit that these assumptions are
no longer true with regard to all urban housing. Today’s urban tenants, the
vast

#673

majority of whom live in multiple dwelling houses, are
interested, not in the land, but solely in “a house suitable for occupation.”
Furthermore,

today’s city dweller usually has a single, specialized skill
unrelated to maintenance work; he is unable to make repairs like the
“jack-of-all-

trades” farmer who was the common law’s model of the lessee.
Further, unlike his agrarian predecessor who often remained on one piece of
land

for his entire life, urban tenants today are more mobile
than ever before. A tenant’s tenure in a specific apartment will often not be
sufficient to

justify efforts at repairs. In addition, the increasing
complexity of today’s dwellings renders them much more difficult to repair than
the structures

of earlier times. In a multiple dwelling repair may require
access to equipment and areas in the control of the landlord. Low and middle
income

tenants, even if they were interested in making repairs,
would be unable to obtain any financing for major repairs since they have no
long-term

interest in the property.

Our approach to the common law of landlord and tenant ought
to be aided by principles derived from the consumer protection cases referred

to above. In a lease contract, a tenant seeks to purchase
from his landlord shelter for a specified period of time. The landlord sells
housing as a

commercial businessman and has much greater opportunity,
incentive and capacity to inspect and maintain the condition of his building.

Moreover, the tenant must rely upon the skill and bona fides
of his landlord at least as much as a car buyer must rely upon the car
manufacturer.

In dealing with major problems, such as heating, plumbing,
electrical or structural defects, the tenant’s position corresponds precisely
with “the

ordinary consumer who cannot be expected to have the
knowledge or capacity or even the opportunity to make adequate inspection of

mechanical instrumentalities, like automobiles, and to
decide for himself whether they are reasonably fit for the designed purpose.”
Henningsen

v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., 161 A.2d 69, 78 (N.J. 1960).

Since a lease contract specifies a particular period of time
during which the tenant has a right to use his apartment for shelter, he may

legitimately expect that the apartment will be fit for
habitation for the time period for which it is rented. We point out that in the
present cases

there is no allegation that appellants’ apartments were in
poor condition or in violation of the housing code at the commencement of the
leases.

Since the lessees continue to pay the same rent, they were
entitled to expect that the landlord would continue to keep the premises in
their

beginning condition during the lease term. It is precisely
such expectations that the law now recognizes as deserving of formal, legal
protection.

Even beyond the rationale of traditional products liability
law, the relationship of landlord and tenant suggests further compelling
reasons

for the law’s protection of the tenants’ legitimate
expectations of quality. The inequality in bargaining power between landlord
and tenant has

#674

been well documented. Tenants have very little leverage to
enforce demands for better housing. Various impediments to competition in the
rental

housing market, such as racial and class discrimination and
standardized form leases, mean that landlords place tenants in a take it or
leave it

situation. The increasingly severe shortage of adequate
housing further increases the landlord’s bargaining power and escalates the
need for

maintaining and improving the existing stock. Finally, the
findings by various studies of the social impact of bad housing has led to the

realization that poor housing is detrimental to the whole
society, not merely to the unlucky ones who must suffer the daily indignity of
living in a

slum.

Thus we are led by our inspection of the relevant legal
principles and precedents to the conclusion that the old common law rule
imposing

an obligation upon the lessee to repair during the lease
term was really never intended to apply to residential urban leaseholds.
Contract

principles established in other areas of the law provide a
more rational framework for the apportionment of landlord-tenant
responsibilities; they

strongly suggest that a warranty of habitability be implied
into all contracts^49 for urban dwellings.

B.We believe, in any event, that the District’s housing code
requires that a warranty of habitability be implied in the leases of all
housing

that it covers. The housing code—formally designated the
Housing Regulations of the District of Columbia—was established and authorized
by

the Commissioners of the District of Columbia on August 1 1,
1955. Since that time, the code has been updated by numerous orders of the

Commissioners. The 75 pages of the Regulations provide a
comprehensive regulatory scheme setting forth in some detail: (a) the standards

which housing in the District of Columbia must meet; (b)
which party, the lessor or the lessee, must meet each standard; and (c) a
system of

inspections, notifications and criminal penalties. The
Regulations themselves are silent on the question of private remedies.

Two previous decisions of this court, however, have held
that the Housing Regulations create legal rights and duties enforceable in tort
by

private parties. * * *

The District of Columbia Court of Appeals gave further
effect to the Housing Regulations in Brown v. Southall Realty Co., 237 A.2d 834

(D.C. App. 1968). There the landlord knew at the time the
lease was signed that housing code violations existed which rendered the
apartment

“unsafe and unsanitary.” Viewing the lease as a contract,
the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that the premises were let in
violation of

Sections 2304^53 and 2501 of the Regulations and that the
lease,

#675

therefore, was void as an illegal contract. In the light of
Brown , it is clear * * * that the basic validity of every housing contract
depends upon

substantial compliance with the housing code at the
beginning of the lease term. The Brown court relied particularly upon Section
2501 of the

Regulations which provides:

Every premises accommodating one or more habitations shall
be maintained and kept in repair so as to provide decent living

accommodations for the occupants. This part of this Code
contemplates more than mere basic repairs and maintenance to keep out the

elements; its purpose is to include repairs and maintenance
designed to make a premises or neighborhood healthy and safe.

By its terms, this section applies to maintenance and repair
during the lease term. Under the Brown holding, serious failure to comply with

this section before the lease term begins renders the
contract void. We think it untenable to find that this section has no effect on
the contract after

it has been signed. To the contrary, by signing the lease
the landlord has undertaken a continuing obligation to the tenant to maintain
the premises

in accordance with all applicable law.

This principle of implied warranty is well established.
Courts often imply relevant law into contracts to provide a remedy for any
damage

caused by one party’s illegal conduct. * * *

[T]he housing code must be read into housing contracts—a
holding also required by the purposes and the structure of the code itself. The

duties imposed by the Housing Regulations may not be waived
or shifted by agreement if the Regulations specifically place the duty upon the

lessor. Criminal penalties are provided if these duties are
ignored. This regulatory structure was established by the Commissioners
because, in

their judgment, the grave conditions in the housing market
required serious action. Yet official enforcement of the housing code has been
far

from uniformly effective. Innumerable studies have
documented the desperate condition of rental housing in the District of
Columbia and in the

nation. * * *

We therefore hold that the Housing Regulations imply a
warranty of habitability, measured by the standards which they set out, into
leases

of all housing that they cover.

V

In the present cases, the landlord sued for possession for
nonpayment of rent. Under contract principles,^61 however, the tenant’s
obligation

to pay rent is dependent upon the landlord’s performance of
his obligations, including his warranty to maintain the premises in habitable

condition. In order to determine whether any rent is owed to

#676

the landlord, the tenants must be given an opportunity to
prove the housing code violations alleged as breach of the landlord’s
warranty.^62

At trial, the finder of fact must make two findings: (1)
whether the alleged violations^63 existed during the period for which past due
rent is

claimed, and (2) what portion, if any or all, of the
tenant’s obligation to pay rent was suspended by the landlord’s breach. If no
part of the tenant’s

rental obligation is found to have been suspended, then a
judgment for possession may issue forthwith. On the other hand, if the jury
determines

that the entire rental obligation has been extinguished by
the landlord’s total breach, then the action for possession on the ground of
nonpayment

must fail.^64

The jury may find that part of the tenant’s rental
obligation has been suspended but that part of the unpaid back rent is indeed
owed to the

landlord. In these circumstances, no judgment for possession
should issue if the tenant agrees to pay the partial rent found to be due. If
the tenant

refuses to pay the partial amount, a judgment for possession
may then be entered.

The judgment of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is
reversed and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with

this opinion.^67

#677

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .For further background on the case, see Richard H.
Chused, _Saunders (a.k.a. Javins) v. First National Realty Corporation_ , in
Property Stories

123 (Gerald Korngold & Andrew P. Morriss eds., 2 d ed.
2009 ). The action began as a lessee rent strike in 1966 , organized by a
Neighborhood Legal

Services Program lawyer, protesting the appalling conditions
at Clifton Terrace. By the time the case went to trial, only six protesting
lessees remained

as defendants. When the case reached the first round of
appeals in the local D.C. court of appeals, all protesting lessees had either
left the complex or

had paid the back rent they owed, making the case
technically moot. The D.C. Circuit’s decision on further appeal, excerpted
here, was issued some four

years after the initial rent strike, by which time the
building had been taken over by the government and was being extensively
renovated. Ironically,

Clifton Terrace was listed in the National Register of
Historic Places in 2001. The citation reads in part that it is a significant
example of a new garden

apartment design developed in the 1920 s and 1930 s,
featuring “superior air circulation, more pleasing views, the inclusion of
balconies, and enhanced

light in each apartment—all at a moderate price.” Id. at
126.

2 .The implied warranty of habitability was one of several
reforms to residential lease law introduced by courts in the District of
Columbia in the

late 1960 s and early 1970 s. Two others of note are the
doctrine of retaliatory eviction, see Edwards v. Habib, 397 F. 2 d 687 (D.C.
Cir. 1968 ), and the

illegal lease doctrine, see Brown v. Southall Realty Co.,
237 A. 2 d 834 (D.C. 1968 ). All three doctrines built on the provisions of the
local housing code

establishing standards for safe and sanitary residential
housing. The doctrine of retaliatory eviction posited that a lessor may not
retaliate against a lessee

for reporting code violations. Thus, even if the lessee is
in a periodic tenancy that the lessor otherwise would be free to terminate at
the end of the period

(often month-to-month where low-income rental housing is
concerned), the lessor cannot give notice to terminate if a court concludes
that the

termination was motivated by a desire to punish the lessee
for asserting her rights under the code. The illegal lease doctrine posited
that if the lessor

leases property that is subject to one or more code
violations, such that the premises are rendered unsafe and unsanitary, then the
lease is void and of no

legal effect. As a result, the lessor is precluded from
suing for unpaid rent based on the lease.

3 .Of the three doctrines, the implied warranty of
habitability (IWH) has been the runaway success story. See Mary Ann Glendon,
The

Transformation of American Landlord-Tenant Law, 23 B.C. L.
Rev. 503 ( 1982 ); Edward H. Rabin, The Revolution in Residential
Landlord-Tenant Law:

Causes and Consequences, 69 Cornell L. Rev. 517 ( 1984 ). An
IWH for residential tenancies or something equivalent is required in most
states. See

generally 1 Milton R. Friedman, Friedman on Leases § 10 : 3
(Andrew R. Berman ed. & rev., 6 th ed. 2017 ). Interestingly, however, all
but ten states that

have adopted the IWH have done so at least in part by
legislation, usually by adopting the relevant provisions of the Uniform
Residential Landlord

Tenant Act, rather than by judicial revision of the common
law, as

```



678



```

in _Javins_. Id. The doctrine of retaliatory eviction has
been widely adopted to protect lessees who engage in protected activity, such
as reporting housing

code violations or attempting to organize a tenants’ union.
But this is a relatively small subset of lessees, relative to those affected by
the conditions of

the leased premises. The illegal lease doctrine suffers from
the fact that if the lease is illegal, then it would seem that the lessee is
not only released from

the burdens of the lease but cannot claim the benefit of the
lease either (such as the covenant of quiet enjoyment). Logically, the tenancy
would become

a tenancy at will or sufferance, which would allow the
lessor to begin immediate eviction proceedings. The IWH, in contrast, gives the
lessee additional

rights under the lease without subjecting the lessee to
immediate eviction. Not surprisingly, law reformers sympathetic to the plight
of poor lessees

quickly gravitated to the IWH rather than the illegal lease
doctrine. Note that the _Javins_ court portrays the violations of the housing
code as having

emerged after the lessees had entered into the leases. This
was probably in an attempt to expand lessees’ rights beyond the illegal lease
doctrine, which

requires code violations when the lease is executed. Is it
plausible that there were no code violations at Clifton Terrace when the leases
were signed, and

1 , 500 violations shortly thereafter?

4 .The court only addresses the question whether there
should be an implied warranty of habitability in leases of “urban residential
housing.” This

leaves open the question whether a similar warranty of
fitness for intended purpose should be implied in leases of commercial or
agricultural property.

To date, only a small minority of states have adopted an
implied warranty of fitness in commercial cases. See, e.g., Richard Barton
Enters. v. Tsern, 928

P. 2 d 368 (Utah 1996 ). More commonly, courts have held,
following _Medico-Dental_ , that covenants in commercial leases are presumed to
be mutually

dependent. See, e.g., Teodori v. Werner, 415 A. 2 d 31 (Pa.
1980 ). What factors are responsible for courts limiting the implied warranty
idea to residential

leases?

5 .Should the implied warranty of habitability be a default
rule or a mandatory rule of law? The _Restatement_ endorses the IWH but
provides that it

can be waived for consideration (such as reduced rent),
provided the agreement is not “unconscionable or significantly against public
policy.”

Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant § 5.
6. Most courts, however, have followed _Javins_ (see footnote 49 ), in making
the IWH a

nonwaivable rule of law. This is seemingly at odds with the
court’s insistence that leases are contracts, since usually rules of contract
law are defaults.

The most common rationale for making the IWH a mandatory
rule of law, following _Javins_ , is the perception that lessees and lessors
have “unequal

bargaining power.” What exactly does this mean in this
context? That there is an imbalance between supply and demand in the market for
low-income

rental properties such that lessors can assume a “take it or
leave it” attitude in lease negotiations? That there are asymmetries in the
information

available to lessors and lessees, such that lessees often
would not understand the significance of a waiver of the IWH? That many lessees
simply cannot

afford the higher rents that lessors would charge for
properties protected by a warranty of quality?

```



679



```

6 .The court in _Javins_ puts great stress on the provisions
of the housing code as defining the content of the IWH. But housing codes vary
greatly in

terms of the detail with which they regulate rental housing,
as well as in the nature of the issues addressed. Should every violation of the
housing code

be deemed a violation of the IWH? Suppose, for example, that
the code requires that all electrical outlets in the kitchen and bathrooms
include circuit

breakers to prevent shock or electrocution. Is an apartment
that has only standard grounded outlets but no circuit breakers in violation of
the IWH?

Courts sometimes avoid this implication by holding that only
those code provisions that implicate “health and safety” define the IWH. But
don’t circuit

breakers implicate health and safety? Alternatively, can the
conditions of the apartment violate the IWH even if there is no code violation?
Suppose, for

example, that the housing code does not require air
conditioning. What if the air conditioning system in an apartment building is
not working, but the

lessor refuses to fix it even though the city is in the
midst of a killer heat wave?

7 .Does the doctrine of constructive eviction (considered in
_Blackett v. Olanoff,_ supra) have any continuing role to play once a
jurisdiction has

adopted the IWH? The answer is clearly yes, insofar as most
jurisdictions have limited the IWH to residential leases and have not adopted
an analogous

implied warranty of fitness for purpose to commercial
leases. Thus, insofar as issues arise about the adequacy of physical conditions
and services under

commercial leases, they continue to be addressed in most
jurisdictions under specific lease provisions or the doctrine of constructive
eviction.

Constructive eviction may also be of continuing relevance
under residential leases, insofar as the jurisdiction relies on its housing
code to define the

content of the IWH. For example, suppose the housing code
does not address the permissible decibel level of noise that may emit from
surrounding

properties controlled by the lessor. Raucous noise from a
bar leased by the lessor might not violate the IWH in these circumstances,
requiring that the

court turn to the doctrine of _Blackett v. Olanoff_ , supra
_,_ to provide a remedy.

8 .What are the remedies for violation of the IWH? Courts,
following _Medico-Dental_ and _Javins_ , have tended to say that all remedies
are available

that would apply in the case of a material breach of a
bilateral commercial contract. These include: ( 1 ) rescission of the lease by
the lessee, thereby

allowing the tenant to vacate without further obligation to
pay rent; ( 2 ) an order directing specific performance of the IWH; ( 3 ) an
action for damages

for breach of the IWH; ( 4 ) if the lessor has sued the
lessee for unpaid rent, a set-off against rent liability reflecting the
lessor’s violation of the IWH; and

( 5 ) in some jurisdictions, withholding of all or a portion
of the rent until the lessor corrects the violation of the IWH or permits the
lessee to arrange for

repair of the violation.

A particularly vexing question concerns how to determine the
damages caused by a breach of the IWH for purposes of remedies ( 3 )–( 5 )
mentioned

above—a lessee suit for damages, a setoff from a lessor
action for unpaid rent, or rent withholding. The straightforward way to
determine damages or

set-offs would seem be to take the rent reserved under the
lease and subtract

```



680



```

the value of the premises in their noncompliant condition.
The problem, as tenant advocates and courts quickly discovered, is that rental
markets are not

that inefficient: The rent reserved under the lease tends to
be equal to the value of the premises in their actual (noncompliant) condition.
So the standard

formula often yields zero damages. This did not seem right
to many advocates and courts, so two substitute formulas were developed. One
asks,

hypothetically, what the fair market rental value would be
if the premises were in compliance with the IWH, and then subtracts the value
of the premises

in their noncompliant condition. This formula is open to the
objection that it awards a windfall to the lessee if the rent reserved was less
than the fair

market value of the premises in compliance with the IWH: The
lessee gets, through the damages formula, more than the lessee agreed to pay
for. The

other, “percentage reduction” formula develops a ratio
between (i) the difference between the value of the premises if in compliance
with the IWH and

the value of the premises if not in compliance with the IWH
over (ii) the value of the premises if in compliance with the IWH, and
multiplies this ratio

times the rent reserved, for the amount of the reduction
(damages). Does this alternative avoid the charge of a windfall to the lessee,
or is it open to the

same objection? See generally Dale A. Whitman et al., The
Law of Property § 6. 42 ( 4 th ed. 2019 ).

9 .In a development probably not appreciated at the time,
the IWH has had important implications for the scope of the lessor’s duty to
the lessee

and the lessee’s guests under tort law. See generally Olin
L. Browder, The Taming of a Duty—The Tort Liability of Landlords, 81 Mich. L.
Rev. 99

( 1982 ). If we start with the common-law baseline, as
reflected in _Paradine v. Jane_ , we see that the risk of casualty losses under
a lease is originally

placed on the lessee. Accordingly, any tort liability for
injuries incurred on the premises (slip and fall accidents, assaults by third
parties, etc.) would lie

with the lessee. This baseline can be modified by particular
lease provisions. For example, if the lessor promises to keep the driveways and
walkways

clear of snow and ice, a slip and fall by a guest of a
tenant may plausibly give rise to tort liability for the lessor, based on the
lessor’s specific

undertaking in the lease. This narrow bridgehead of
liability becomes potentially huge with the introduction of the implied
warranty of habitability.

Now, the lessor has a general legal obligation to maintain
the premises in a manner consistent with the housing code, and otherwise to
insure that it

meets minimal standards of public safety and health. This
legally-imposed duty can provide the foundation for a broad lessor duty in tort
to the lessee

and the lessee’s guests, including a duty to protect these
persons against assaults by intruders who could have been kept at bay with
proper security

cameras and locks. See, e.g., Sargent v. Ross, 308 A. 2 d
528 (N.H. 1973 ) (holding landlord liable for death of four-year-old girl who
fell from outdoor

stairway not part of a common area).

In California, the courts initially concluded, by analogy to
products liability law, that the lessor would be strictly liable for tortious
injuries caused

by a breach of the IWH. Becker v. IRM Corp., 698 P. 2 d 116
(Cal. 1985 ). One decade later, the California Supreme Court changed its mind,
overruled

_Becker_ , and decided that lessors would be liable only for
injuries

```



681



```

caused by a negligent breach of the IWH. Peterson v.
Superior Court, 899 P. 2 d 905 (Cal. 1995 ). What do you suppose motivated the
retreat? Another

source of controversy has been lessor tort liability for
crimes and intentional torts by third persons. If a lessor fails to keep the
locks on doors in good

repair, and a criminal exploits the situation to the injury
of a lessee, should the lessor pay? See Kline v. 1500 Mass. Ave. Apartment
Corp., 439 F. 2 d 477

(D.C. Cir. 1970 ) (holding lessor liable in tort when lessee
was criminally assaulted in apartment hallway).

The Consequences of the Implied Warranty of Habitability

Without doubt the most controversial aspect of the IWH has
been whether it improves the welfare of low-income lessees. Commentators

have addressed this primarily from a theoretical
perspective, although there is some empirical evidence bearing on the question.

Theory. In the early years after Javins , commentators
divided into two camps about whether imposing a mandatory IWH would improve

the welfare of low-income lessees. One camp, representing
orthodox microeconomic assumptions, argued that the IWH, like any government-

mandated minimal product quality standard, would increase
both the demand for low-cost housing (because the product would be better) and

increase the costs of supplying such housing (because strict
code compliance costs money). Consequently, imposing the IWH would cause rents

to rise and the supply of low-cost housing to fall. See
Richard A. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law § 16.6 (6th ed. 2003); Lawrence
Berger,

The New Residential Tenancy Law—Are Landlords Public
Utilities?, 60 Neb. L. Rev. 707 (1981); Charles J. Meyers, The Covenant of

Habitability and the American Law Institute, 27 Stan. L.
Rev. 879 (1975). Poor lessees would either have to dig deeper into their
pockets to pay

for housing or be forced to squeeze more people into smaller
units by doubling up.

Another camp, representing legal scholars more sympathetic
to the mandatory IWH, argued that the low-income rental market is different

from other types of product markets, and that because of
these differences, the IWH might improve the quality of housing without any
significant

increase in rents. Thus, Bruce Ackerman argued that
low-income households could not afford to pay more in rent and would refuse to
double up.

At the same time, lessors, because of their large sunk
investment, could not afford to exit from the market, and so the supply of
low-income

housing was largely fixed. Ackerman accordingly argued that
both the demand for and the supply of low-income housing are largely inelastic,
at

least in the short run, permitting some redistribution from
lessors to lessees through a mandatory IWH. Bruce A. Ackerman, Regulating Slum

Housing Markets on Behalf of the Poor: Of Housing Codes,
Housing Subsidies and Income Redistribution Policy, 80 Yale L.J. 1093 (1971).

Duncan Kennedy argued that many slumlords recognize that
their property is deteriorating and will have to be abandoned some

#682

years in the future; given this realization, such lessors
may “milk” the property by forgoing even routine maintenance while continuing
to collect

as much rent as possible in the period before the end
arrives. Imposing a mandatory IWH on such lessors, Kennedy argued, would not
change

their calculus about how long to remain in the market, but
might result in significant improvements in quality for the lessees. Duncan
Kennedy,

The Effect of the Warranty of Habitability on Low Income
Housing: “Milking” and Class Violence, 15 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 485 (1987).

More recently, “second wave” treatments of the question
suggest that the matter is more complex: Some lessees will benefit while others

will lose from a mandatory IWH. See Richard Craswell,
Passing on the Costs of Legal Rules: Efficiency and Distribution in
Buyer-Seller

Relationships, 43 Stan. L. Rev. 361 (1991). Craswell, for
example, argues that it is critical to distinguish between “marginal” and
“infra-

marginal” lessees. In a competitive market, the price for a
good like housing is determined by the intersection of demand and supply
curves.

Assuming lessors cannot discriminate among prospective
lessees based on their demand for housing, the same rent will be charged to all
lessees

for housing of equivalent quality. The rent will be
determined by the demand of the last or “marginal” lessee who is just willing
to pay the price

necessary to induce the last or “marginal” lessor to put the
housing on the market. But this price does not reflect the value that other
lessees place

on housing of equivalent quality. The basic postulate of a
downward sloping demand curve is that there are other lessees—fewer in number

perhaps—who would be willing to pay even more for housing of
equivalent quality. Economists refer to these other lessees as
“infra-marginal.”

The marginal lessee pays a price for housing exactly equal
to what that lessee is willing to pay. The infra-marginal lessee enjoys a
“consumer

surplus” equal to the difference between the price she would
be willing to pay and the market price, which is determined by what the last or

marginal lessee is willing to pay.

Craswell notes that when a mandatory warranty is introduced
into a competitive market, the demand curve for the good will shift upward

and to the right, because the good is now worth more to
consumers than it was before. Similarly, the supply curve for the good will
shift upward

and to the left, because it is now more expensive to produce
the good than it was before. Craswell argues, however, that the demand curve
will

not necessarily shift up and to the right parallel to the
original demand curve. If marginal lessees place a low value on the warranty,
perhaps

because their budgets are already stretched to maximum and
they cannot afford to pay even a few dollars more for housing, then it is
possible

that the demand curve will shift relatively little for the
marginal lessees, but may shift farther for the infra-marginal lessees.
Conversely, the

opposite might occur. Marginal lessees might place a higher
value on the warranty than infra-marginal lessees do. These two possibilities
are

illustrated by the following graphic, taken from his
article, id. at 378:

#683

Figure 6-3

Low- and High-Valuing Marginal Customers

As Craswell explains, in the left-hand side of the graphic:

[T]he vertical shift in the demand curve from D1 to D2
exceeds this price increase for most consumers of the product, especially those

located toward the left of the graph. This implies that the
price increase accompanying the warranty is less than the maximum these

consumers are willing to pay for the warranty, so the
warranty has made these consumers better off. The only consumers who lose

from the introduction of the warranty are those located
between the Q1 and Q2 lines, whose demand curve shifts upward by less than

the price increase from P1 to P2. These consumers are
unwilling to buy the product/warranty combination at the higher price. Since

these consumers were willing to buy the product before the
introduction of the warranty, they are made worse off by having to give up

this benefit.

By contrast, the graph on the right in [Figure 6-3] shows a
market in which most consumers are made worse off by the warranty

because the correlation of consumer preferences has been
reversed. In this market, the infra-marginal consumers who are willing to

pay the most for the product alone are willing to pay very
little extra for the warranty. These consumers are located toward the left of

the graph, where the D1 curve (representing the demand for
the product itself) is relatively high, but the D2 curve (representing the

additional demand for the warranty) is only slightly higher.
These consumers value the warranty by less than the price increase from

P1 to P2 , so these consumers will be made worse off by the
warranty. Only the consumers located near the Q1 – Q2 margin place a

large enough value on the warranty, so these are the only
consumers who even come close to benefiting from the warranty.

Id. at 378–79.

#684

Craswell suggests that insofar as the left side graphic is a
more plausible depiction of the shift in the demand curve following the

introduction of a mandatory warranty, infra-marginal
consumers may well benefit from the warranty, whereas marginal consumers may
well lose.

“[T]he benefit to those consumers who continue to buy the
product comes, at least partially, at the expense of the marginal consumers,
who now

find themselves priced out of the market.” Id. at 395.

Craswell is only concerned with determining whether tenant
welfare will be improved by imposing a mandatory IWH. What about lessor

welfare? Can we presume that lessors will always be worse
off, on the ground that if it were in their commercial interest to keep their
rental units

up to code, they would do so voluntarily? Suppose that in
the aggregate the IWH makes infra-marginal lessees better off by, say $1,000,
makes

marginal lessees worse off by $500, and makes lessors worse
off by $750. Are we justified in imposing the IWH on these facts? This outcome
is

inefficient under an aggregate wealth maximization
(Kaldor-Hicks) standard for measuring social utility.

If we reject aggregate wealth maximization as the test, on
the ground that it ignores distributional concerns, we still have a dilemma
under

Craswell’s analysis. Suppose lessors are the best-off group
affected by the IWH, infra-marginal lessees are the next best-off group, and
marginal

lessees are the worst-off group. Insofar as the IWH takes
from the lessors and transfers to the infra-marginal lessees, it has
egalitarian

distributional consequences. But how do we weigh the fact
that the IWH may also make the worst-off lessees (by assumption here the
marginals)

even worse off, while benefiting the less-worse-off lessees
(here the infra-marginals)? John Rawls suggested in his Theory of Justice
(1971) that

deviations from equal treatment are justifiable only if they
can be shown to make the worst-off group in society better off. Does the IWH
flunk

the Rawlsian test under the hypothetical?

Empirical Evidence. Most studies of the implied warranty of
habitability have been theoretical and most of the empirical writing on this

issue is casual at best. One early study found a
statistically significant effect—an increase of approximately 12 percent—on
rent in the early

1970s from receivership laws, in which a noncompliant
lessors would lose control over a building to a receiver who would direct
repairs. Werner

Z. Hirsch, Joel G. Hirsch & Stephen Margolis, Regression
Analysis of the Effects of Habitability Laws Upon Rent: An Empirical
Observation on

the Ackerman-Komesar Debate, 63 Cal. L. Rev. 1098 (1975).
Other habitability laws, such as repair-and-deduct and withholding, showed a

smaller effect on rents that was not statistically
significant. Whether the IWH has an effect on aggregate housing supply is
difficult to disentangle

from other trends in housing happening at the same time. One
reason that the IWH has not had more of an effect is that enforcement levels
have

been low. A recent overview summarizes the

#685

findings of a number of studies based on observations of
landlord-tenant courts:

First, the new substantive regime did not appear to increase
the number of eviction cases filed. This suggests that few tenants are

withholding rent deliberately to bring the issue of repairs
to court.

Second, the judicial resources applied to the average case
are quite modest. Nine-minute trials take the concept of a “rocket

docket” to an entirely different level, and the number of
jury trials has remained extremely small.

Third, a huge fraction of eviction cases never reach open
court. Landlord-tenant courts have extremely high default rates. * * *

Once landlords receive all that they sought—either rent or
possession—they voluntarily dismiss their cases. This suggests that tenants

are indeed choosing to move rather than litigate. * * *

Fourth, of the minority of cases that reach court, the
overwhelming majority are resolved with no reference to the condition of the

premises. * * * Many tenants lack the sophistication to
assert the warranty in a written pleading or the presence of mind and

assertiveness to do so orally in the momentary window of
opportunity presented in open court. Because of very limited legal services

funding, tenants are seldom represented by counsel, and
without the help of lawyers may not have a clear understanding of their new

rights or of court procedures.

David A. Super, The Rise and Fall of the Implied Warranty of
Habitability, 99 Cal. L. Rev. 389, 434–36 (2 01 1) (footnotes omitted). The
author

concludes that “the new regime of landlord-tenant law
inaugurated four decades ago has failed at achieving any of its major goals.”
Id. at 458.

(New York City has recently provided for paid legal
consultation for low-income lessees complaining about the quality of their
housing and for

full legal representation in eviction proceedings. It will
be instructive to see if this changes the picture painted by Super.)

An alternative to the IWH, which is increasingly the focus
of public policy, is to provide direct rental assistance to low-income
families,

either through housing vouchers or by inducing developers to
include rent-subsidized units in new housing developments. For an overview and

#### Sommer v. Kridel

```



New Jersey Supreme Court, 1977.



378 A. 2 d 767.



```

■
PASHMAN, J. We granted certification in these cases to consider whether a
landlord seeking damages from a defaulting tenant is under a duty to

mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-let an
apartment wrongfully vacated by the tenant. Separate parts of the Appellate
Division

held that, in accordance with their respective leases, the
landlords in both cases could recover rents due under the leases regardless of
whether

they had attempted to re-let the vacated apartments.
Although they were of different minds as to the fairness of this result, both
parts agreed that

it was dictated by Joyce v. Bauman , 174 A. 693 (N.J. 1934),
a decision by the former Court of Errors and Appeals. We now reverse and hold
that

a landlord does have an obligation to make a reasonable
effort to mitigate damages in such a situation. We therefore overrule Joyce v.
Bauman to

the extent that it is inconsistent with our decision today.

I

* * * This case was tried on stipulated facts. On March 10,
      1972 the defendant, James Kridel, entered into a lease with the plaintiff,

Abraham Sommer, owner of the “Pierre Apartments” in
Hackensack, to rent apartment 6–L in that building.^1 The term of the lease was
from

May 1, 1972 until April 30, 1974, with a rent concession for
the first six weeks, so that the first month’s rent was not due until June 15,
1972.

One week after signing the agreement, Kridel paid Sommer
$690. Half of that sum was used to satisfy the first month’s rent. The
remainder

was paid under the lease provision requiring a security
deposit of $345. Although defendant had expected to begin occupancy around May
1, his

plans were changed. He wrote to Sommer on May 19, 1972,
explaining

I was to be married on June 3, 1972. Unhappily the
engagement was broken and the wedding plans cancelled. Both parents were to

assume responsibility for the rent after our marriage. I was
discharged from the U.S. Army in October 1971 and am now a student. I

have no funds of my own, and am supported by my stepfather.

In view of the above, I cannot take possession of the
apartment and am surrendering all rights to it. Never having received a key, I

cannot return same to you.

#687

I beg your understanding and compassion in releasing me from
the lease, and will of course, in consideration thereof, forfeit the 2

month’s rent already paid.

Please notify me at your earliest convenience.

Plaintiff did not answer the letter.

Subsequently, a third party went to the apartment house and
inquired about renting apartment 6–L. Although the parties agreed that she was

ready, willing and able to rent the apartment, the person in
charge told her that the apartment was not being shown since it was already
rented to

Kridel. In fact, the landlord did not re-enter the apartment
or exhibit it to anyone until August 1, 1973. At that time it was rented to a
new tenant

for a term beginning on September 1, 1973. The new rental
was for $345 per month with a six week concession similar to that granted
Kridel.

Prior to re-letting the new premises, plaintiff sued Kridel
in August 1972, demanding $7,590, the total amount due for the full two-year
term

of the lease. Following a mistrial, plaintiff filed an
amended complaint asking for $5,865, the amount due between May 1, 1972 and
September

1, 197 3. The amended complaint included no reduction in the
claim to reflect the six week concession provided for in the lease or the $690

payment made to plaintiff after signing the agreement.
Defendant filed an amended answer to the complaint, alleging that plaintiff
breached the

contract, failed to mitigate damages and accepted
defendant’s surrender of the premises. He also counterclaimed to demand
repayment of the

$345 paid as a security deposit.

The trial judge ruled in favor of defendant. Despite his
conclusion that the lease had been drawn to reflect “the ‘settled law’ of this
state,” he

found that “justice and fair dealing” imposed upon the
landlord the duty to attempt to re-let the premises and thereby mitigate
damages. He also

held that plaintiff’s failure to make any response to
defendant’s unequivocal offer of surrender was tantamount to an acceptance,
thereby

terminating the tenancy and any obligation to pay rent. As a
result, he dismissed both the complaint and the counterclaim. The Appellate

Division reversed in a per curiam opinion, and we granted
certification. * * *

II

As the lower courts in both appeals found, the weight of
authority in this State supports the rule that a landlord is under no duty to
mitigate

damages caused by a defaulting tenant. This rule has been
followed in a majority of states, Annot. 21 A.L.R.3d 53 4, § 2(a) at 541
(1968), and has

been tentatively adopted in the American Law Institute’s
Restatement of Property. Restatement (Second) of Property, § 1 1.1(3) (Tent.
Draft No.

3, 1975).

#688

Nevertheless, while there is still a split of authority over
this question, the trend among recent cases appears to be in favor of a
mitigation

requirement.

The majority rule is based on principles of property law
which equate a lease with a transfer of a property interest in the owner’s
estate.

Under this rationale the lease conveys to a tenant an
interest in the property which forecloses any control by the landlord; thus, it
would be

anomalous to require the landlord to concern himself with
the tenant’s abandonment of his own property.

For instance, in Muller v. Beck , [ 110 A. 831 (N.J. 192
0)], where essentially the same issue was posed, the court clearly treated the
lease as

governed by property, as opposed to contract, precepts.^3
The court there observed that the “tenant had an estate for years, but it was
an estate

qualified by this right of the landlord to prevent its
transfer,” 110 A. at 832, and that “the tenant has an estate with which the
landlord may not

interfere.” Id. Similarly, in Heckel v. Griese , [171 A. 148
(N.J. 1934)], the court noted the absolute nature of the tenant’s interest in
the property

while the lease was in effect, stating that “when the tenant
vacated,... no one, in the circumstances, had any right to interfere with the

defendant’s possession of the premises.” 171 A. 148, 149. *

Yet the distinction between a lease for ordinary residential
purposes and an ordinary contract can no longer be considered viable. As

Professor Powell observed, evolving “social factors have
exerted increasing influence on the law of estates for years.” 2 Powell on Real
Property

(1977 ed.), § 221(1) at 180–81. The result has been that

[t]he complexities of city life, and the proliferated
problems of modern society in general, have created new problems for lessors
and

lessees and these have been commonly handled by specific
clauses in leases. This growth in the number and detail of specific lease

covenants has reintroduced into the law of estates for years
a predominantly contractual ingredient. (Id. at 181)

Thus in 6 Williston on Contracts (3 ed. 1962), § 890A at
592, it is stated:

There is a clearly discernible tendency on the part of
courts to cast aside technicalities in the interpretation of leases and to
concentrate

their attention, as in the case of other contracts, on the
intention of the parties * * *

See also Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 428 F.2d
1071, 1075 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (“the trend toward treating leases as contracts is
wise and

well considered”) * * *

This Court has taken the lead in requiring that landlords
provide housing services to tenants in accordance with implied duties which are

#689

hardly consistent with the property notions expressed in
Muller v. Beck , supra, and Heckel v. Griese , supra. See Braitman v. Overlook
Terrace

Corp., 346 A.2d 76 (N.J. 1975) (liability for failure to
repair defective apartment door lock); Berzito v. Gambino, 308 A.2d 17 (N.J.
1973)

(construing implied warranty of habitability and covenant to
pay rent as mutually dependent); Marini v. Ireland, 265 A.2d 526 (N.J. 1970)

(implied covenant to repair); Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper,
251 A.2d 268 (N.J. 1969) (implied warranty of fitness of premises for leased

purpose). In fact, in Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper , supra,
we specifically noted that the rule which we announced there did not comport
with the

historical notion of a lease as an estate for years. And in
Marini v. Ireland , supra, we found that the “guidelines employed to construe
contracts

have been modernly applied to the construction of leases.”
265 A.2d at 532.

Application of the contract rule requiring mitigation of
damages to a residential lease may be justified as a matter of basic
fairness.^4

Professor McCormick first commented upon the inequity under
the majority rule when he predicted in 1925 that eventually

the logic, inescapable according to the standards of a
“jurisprudence of conceptions” which permits the landlord to stand idly by the

vacant, abandoned premises and treat them as the property of
the tenant and recover full rent, will yield to the more realistic notions of

social advantage which in other fields of the law have
forbidden a recovery for damages which the plaintiff by reasonable efforts
could

have avoided. [McCormick, The Rights of the Landlord Upon
Abandonment of the Premises by the Tenant, 23 Mich. L. Rev. 21 1,

221–22 (1925)]

Various courts have adopted this position. See Annot.,
supra, § 7(a) at 565, and ante at 770–771.

The pre-existing rule cannot be predicated upon the
possibility that a landlord may lose the opportunity to rent another empty
apartment

because he must first rent the apartment vacated by the
defaulting tenant. Even where the breach occurs in a multi-dwelling building,
each

apartment may have unique qualities which make it attractive
to certain individuals. Significantly, in Sommer v. Kridel , there was a
specific

request to rent the apartment vacated by the defendant;
there is no reason to believe that absent this vacancy the landlord could have
succeeded in

renting a different apartment to this individual.

We therefore hold that antiquated real property concepts
which served as the basis for the pre-existing rule, shall no longer be
controlling

where there is a claim for damages under a residential
lease. Such claims must be governed by more modern notions of fairness and
equity. A

#690

landlord has a duty to mitigate damages where he seeks to
recover rents due from a defaulting tenant.

If the landlord has other vacant apartments besides the one
which the tenant has abandoned, the landlord’s duty to mitigate consists of

making reasonable efforts to re-let the apartment. In such
cases he must treat the apartment in question as if it was one of his vacant
stock.

As part of his cause of action, the landlord shall be
required to carry the burden of proving that he used reasonable diligence in
attempting to

re-let the premises. We note that there has been a
divergence of opinion concerning the allocation of the burden of proof on this
issue. See

Annot., supra, § 12 at 577. While generally in contract
actions the breaching party has the burden of proving that damages are capable
of

mitigation, here the landlord will be in a better position
to demonstrate whether he exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to
re-let the

premises. Cf. Kulm v. Coast to Coast Stores Central Org.,
432 P.2d 1006 (Or. 1967) (burden on lessor in contract to renew a lease).

III

The Sommer v. Kridel case presents a classic example of the
unfairness which occurs when a landlord has no responsibility to minimize

damages. Sommer waited 15 months and allowed $4658.50 in
damages to accrue before attempting to re-let the apartment. Despite the

availability of a tenant who was ready, willing and able to
rent the apartment, the landlord needlessly increased the damages by turning
her away.

While a tenant will not necessarily be excused from his
obligations under a lease simply by finding another person who is willing to
rent the

vacated premises, see, e.g., Reget v. Dempsey-Tegler &
Co., 216 N.E.2d 500 (Ill. App. 1966) (new tenant insisted on leasing the
premises under

different terms); Edmands v. Rust & Richardson Drug Co.,
77 N.E. 713 (Mass. 1906) (landlord need not accept insolvent tenant), here
there has

been no showing that the new tenant would not have been
suitable. We therefore find that plaintiff could have avoided the damages which

eventually accrued, and that the defendant was relieved of
his duty to continue paying rent. Ordinarily we would require the tenant to
bear the

cost of any reasonable expenses incurred by a landlord in
attempting to re-let the premises, but no such expenses were incurred in this
case.^5

---

In assessing whether the landlord has satisfactorily carried
his burden, the trial court shall consider, among other factors, whether the

landlord, either personally or through an agency, offered or
showed the apartment to any prospective tenants, or advertised it in local
newspapers.

Additionally, the tenant may attempt to rebut such evidence
by showing that he proffered suitable tenants who were rejected. However, there
is

no standard formula for measuring whether the

#691

landlord has utilized satisfactory efforts in attempting to
mitigate damages, and each case must be judged upon its own facts. Compare
Hershorin

v. La Vista, Inc., 138 S.E.2d 703 (Ga. App. 1964)
(“reasonable effort” of landlord by showing the apartment to all prospective
tenants); Carpenter

v. Wisniewski, 215 N.E.2d 882 (Ind. App. 1966) (duty
satisfied where landlord advertised the premises through a newspaper, placed a
sign in the

window, and employed a realtor); Re Garment Center Capitol,
Inc., 93 F.2d 667 (2d Cir. 1938) (landlord’s duty not breached where higher
rental

was asked since it was known that this was merely a basis
for negotiations); Foggia v. Dix, 509 P.2d 412, 414 (Or. 1973) (in mitigating
damages,

landlord need not accept less than fair market value or
“substantially alter his obligations as established in the pre-existing
lease”); with

Anderson v. Andy Darling Pontiac, Inc., 43 N.W.2d 362 (Wis.
1950) (reasonable diligence not established where newspaper advertisement

placed in one issue of local paper by a broker); Scheinfeld
v. Muntz T. V., Inc., 214 N.E.2d 506 (Ill. App. 1966) (duty breached where
landlord

refused to accept suitable subtenant); Consolidated Sun Ray,
Inc. v. Oppenstein, 335 F.2d 801, 811 (8th Cir. 1964) (dictum) (demand for rent

which is “far greater than the provisions of the lease
called for” negates landlord’s assertion that he acted in good faith in seeking
a new tenant).

IV

The judgment in Sommer v. Kridel is reversed. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Do the facts of _Sommer v. Kridel_ stack the question
whether the lessor should have a duty to mitigate too much in favor of the
lessee? James

Kridel has a uniquely sympathetic story, never takes
possession of the apartment, and openly communicates with the lessor about his
situation. In a

companion case decided along with _Sommer_ , the lessee
abandoned the apartment in the middle of the lease term, apparently made no
effort to

communicate with the lessor, and offered defenses that the
lower court described as “frivolous.” Riverview Realty Co. v. Perosio, 350 A. 2
d 517 , 518

(N.J. Super. Ct. 1976 ), rev’d, 378 A. 2 d 767 (N.J. 1977 ).
Should these facts make a difference? The New Jersey Supreme Court held they
did not, and

extended to duty to mitigate to all residential leases.

2 .The duty to mitigate damages has been only slightly less
successful than the implied warranty of habitability as a reform. One decision
reports

that 42 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the
duty to mitigate damages when the tenant abandons, at least for residential
leases. See

Austin Hill Country Realty, Inc. v. Palisades Plaza, Inc.,
948 S.W. 2 d 293 (Tex. 1997 ) (adopting the duty to mitigate under Texas law).
A more recent

survey article puts the numbers somewhat lower, 33 in favor
and 14 against, with other states adopting a standard in between. Stephanie G.
Flynn, Duty

to Mitigate Damages Upon a Tenant’s Abandonment, 34 Real
Prop. Prob. & Tr. J. 721 , 732 ( 2000 ). The _Restatement_ rejects an
implied duty to mitigate,

Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant § 12.
1 , cmt. i, on the

```

```

somewhat curious reasoning that it encourages lessees to
abandon leased properties and thus may lead to vandalism. (What does this
assume about the

financial condition of abandoning lessees?) As in the case
of the IWH, the reform effort has focused on residential tenancies, and, as in
the case of the

IWH, has proceeded more by legislation than by judicial
reform. See 2 Milton R. Friedman, Friedman on Leases § 16 : 3 : 1 (Andrew R.
Berman ed. &

rev., 6 th ed. 2017 ) (noting that in the commercial lease
context “there has been very little change in the traditional common law rule,
and in fact some

major jurisdictions, including New York and Pennsylvania,
have reiterated their adherence to that rule.”). The duty to mitigate, which is
a pure contract

doctrine, is in fact probably more unambiguously contractual
than the IWH. Some decisions, including _Austin Hill_ , recognize that the duty
to mitigate is

a default rule subject to modification by the parties in the
lease; the IWH, in contrast, is generally regarded as a mandatory rule of law
derived in part

from the housing codes which is not subject to waiver.

Figure 6-4

Pierre Apartments, Hackensack, New Jersey

3 .Recall that the common-law courts, working within the
framework of the independent covenants model, developed the doctrine of
surrender to

deal with lessees who abandon the premises. How would
_Sommer_ be decided under this doctrine? Did Kreidel offer to surrender? Did
the lessor accept?

Are lessees always better off under the contractual duty to
mitigate than they are under surrender? Are lessees free to invoke the old
doctrine as an

alternative to the duty to mitigate, or should the duty to
mitigate override the doctrine of surrender?

```



693



```

4 .Should a lessee be required to attempt to sublet or
assign the leasehold before the lessor has a duty to mitigate? (See “Transfer
of Interests”

immediately below.) If the lease requires the lessor’s
permission to sublet or assign, the lessee could seek the lessor’s permission.
Even if the lease

prohibits subletting or assigning, the lessee could ask the
lessor to waive this restriction. Would such a rule encourage communication
between lessor

and lessee? See David Crump, Should the Commercial Landlord
Have a Duty to Mitigate Damages After the Tenant Abandons? A Legal and Economic

Analysis, 49 Wake Forest L. Rev. 187 ( 2014 ).

e.TRANSFER OF INTERESTS

Before you jump to the conclusion that leases are just a
branch of contract law, it is important to consider some issues where
property-like

notions continue to hold sway. One such issue involves the
transfer of possession to the lessee. Under a lease, possession of the property
(the

land, the apartment, the car) shifts from the lessor to the
lessee. Thus, during the term of the lease, the lessee acts as the general
gatekeeper of the

property, and can exercise the in rem rights of exclusion
that we associate with possession of property. In this respect, leases of
personal property

are a kind of bailment, involving a temporary transfer of
possession (but not full ownership). Recall that in The Winkfield , in Chapter
IV, the

court held that a bailee has the right to bring actions
against a third-party tortfeasor for interfering with possession of property
while in custody of

the bailee. Similarly, the lessee has the right to bring
actions like trespass or conversion against tortfeasors who interfere with
leased land or

items of personal property during the term of the lease.

Another set of issues that raise property-like notions
involve transfers of either the lessor’s reversion or the lessee’s leasehold
interest to

some third party during the term of the lease. The general
rule is that when the lessor transfers the reversion, the transferee takes
subject to the

lessee’s leasehold interest, just as someone acquiring
property in which another has a life estate would acquire subject to the life
estate. But when

this happens, is the new lessor bound by all the provisions
of the original lease? Consider the following case.

#### Mullendore Theatres, Inc. v. Growth Realty Investors

Co.

```



Court of Appeals of Washington, 1984.



691 P. 2 d 970.



```

■
WORSWICK, JUDGE. Does a landlord’s covenant to refund a tenant’s security
deposit run with the land, thus obligating a successor landlord to

refund it? We hold it does not, where the lease permits but
does not require that the deposit, if forfeited, be used for the benefit of the
leased

property.

#694

In 1969, Conner Theatres Corporation became tenant of a part
of the Jones Building in Tacoma under a lease that required a deposit of

$22,500 as security for performance of the tenant’s
obligations. The lease provided in part:

Should the Tenant default in the performance of said lease,
the Landlord shall be entitled to apply said deposit on account of any

damages which Landlord may sustain by reason of such default
by the Tenant. In the event the Tenant shall not be in default under the

provisions of said lease, the said deposit shall be returned
and paid to the Tenant at the expiration of this lease, to wit, at the close of

business on July 31, 1979....

The lease also provided that all covenants in the lease
would run with the land.

In 1974, Conner assigned its leasehold interest to
Mullendore Theatres, Inc. At that time, the deposit was reduced to $6,000.
Sometime

before the assignment, the original landlord had transferred
the property to North Pacific World Trade Center, Ltd. Growth Realty acquired
it

when North Pacific defaulted on a note and deed of trust in
1975. Growth ultimately sold it to the City of Tacoma. The City was concerned
with

the potential $6,000 liability, and wanted to reduce the
purchase price by this amount. To avoid this, Growth agreed to indemnify the
City for any

liability it might have for the security deposit. In 1980,
Mullendore negotiated a new lease with the City. To facilitate the transaction,
it released

any claims it might have against the City for return of the
security deposit, but purported to reserve its claims against others who might
be liable.

Thereafter, it brought this action against Growth.

The trial court held that the covenant to refund the
security deposit ran with the land and bound Growth through the indemnification
clause

in the sales contract between Growth and the City. Growth
appeals, contending that the covenant did not run. In the alternative, Growth
contends

that any obligation it may have assumed was extinguished by
Mullendore’s release of the City. We agree with Growth’s first contention.

A lease covenant does not run with the land unless it
touches or concerns the land. To do so, it must be so related to the land as to
enhance

its value and confer a benefit upon it. Otherwise, it is a
collateral and personal obligation of the original lessor.

In order to be a running covenant, a promise to pay money
must restrict the use of the funds to the benefit of the property. Rodruck v.
Sand

Point Maintenance Comm’n, 295 P.2d 714, 722 (Wash. 1956).^1

There was no such restriction in this covenant. The landlord
was not required to spend the money for repairs or maintenance, or in any other

way related to the property. He was not even required to
transfer it to

#695

his successors. The covenant was not directly related to,
and did not touch and concern, the property.^2

Since it does not touch and concern the land, this covenant
cannot run, despite the language in the lease which says it does. Intent is not

enough to make a running covenant out of one which is by its
nature personal.

The City had no obligation to return the security deposit.
Growth agreed only to indemnify the City against potential liability. That

agreement did not create any new liability. We need not
consider further arguments concerning the effect of the transactions between

Reversed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Security deposits are (relatively speaking) a modern
device for securing the payment of rent and the lessee’s performance of other
obligations

under the lease. At common law, the lessor’s main protection
was a privilege of self-help known as the “distraint for rent,” in which the
lessor would

seize personal property of the lessee either to coerce the
lessee into paying or as a kind of after-the-fact security interest which the
lessor could consume

or sell in satisfaction of the rent obligation. (As
mentioned in Chapter IV, the action for replevin evolved from a writ that
allowed lessees to recover

distrained property, and then obtain a legal test of whether
rent was owed or not.) Today, distraint is rarely encountered, the most
prominent exception

probably being leases of storage lockers, which are chock
full of personal property and have high default rates. But the lessor’s right
of distraint in this

and other contexts is regulated by statutes imposing various
notice and waiting period requirements. Security deposits have become far more
popular,

lessors being more interested in money than in conducting
tag sales.

2 .When the lessor transfers the reversion and the property
is burdened by a lease that is still in effect, the ordinary rule is that new
owner of the

reversion takes subject to the ongoing leasehold interest.
There is authority suggesting that the original parties can contract around
this rule and provide

in the lease that the leasehold will terminate upon any
transfer by the lessor—at least if the termination clause is very prominently
disclosed. See Robert

S. Schoshinski, American Law of Landlord and Tenant § 8 : 3
( 1980 ). If a lessor defaults on a loan secured by a mortgage and loses the
property in a

foreclosure, the new owner is typically not bound by the
lease; the lease is regarded as subordinate to the mortgage lien. For more on
mortgages, see

Chapter VII.

3 .However, it is also the ordinary rule that when the
reversion is sold the new lessor and the original lessee are not bound by all
provisions of the

original lease, only by those that “run with the land.” In
determining whether a lease covenant runs with the land, the ordinary test,
applied by the

principal case, is to ask ( 1 ) whether the parties intended
the covenant to run, and ( 2 ) whether the covenant “touches and concerns” the
land. See

Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant § 16.
1 ( 2 ). What is the purpose of imposing this additional requirement beyond
intent to run?

What does it mean to say that a promise “touches and
concerns” the land? The court says that it means the promise must be “so
related to the land as to

enhance its value and confer a benefit upon it.” This is not
very helpful, but as we will see more fully when we consider servitudes running
with the land

in Chapter IX (where the “touch and concern” test also
applies), courts have not been able to do much better than this. One would
think that if the

general rule about continuation of the leasehold when the
reversion is sold is subject to modification by contract (i.e., in the original
lease), then the rule

that only those lease clauses that touch and concern the
land would also be subject to modification by contract. (In other words, we
would expect “touch

and concern” to be only a default rule.) But the court here
holds that a provision in the lease stating that all covenants run with the
land will not be

enforced if the covenant does not in fact touch and concern
the land. Can you think of any justification for making the touch and concern
test for running

covenants nonwaivable?

4 .The court says that in order for a promise to pay money
to touch and concern the land, the promise “must restrict the use of the funds
to the

benefit of the property.” Here, the promise is to return a
security deposit at the end of the lease. Broadly speaking, a security deposit
can be said to have

one of two purposes. One is to provide a “damage deposit”
that the lessor can tap into to make any necessary repairs for which the
outgoing lessee is

responsible under the lease. If this is the purpose of the
security deposit, why doesn’t it touch and concern the land? Is the problem
that _keeping_ the

security deposit would “benefit the property,” but
_returning_ it would not? But isn’t the promise to return the deposit necessary
in order to get the money

and have it on hand if it becomes necessary to keep it? A
second purpose is to provide a “security interest” to assure that the lessor
receives the final

payment of rent. Why doesn’t this purpose also touch and
concern the land? Consider the matter this way: Surely a covenant to pay rent
runs with the

land and hence touches and concerns the land. This is of the
essence in the bargain between the lessor and the lessee (recall that _Paradine
v. Jane_ holds

that the covenant to pay rent is implied in all leases). If
the covenant to pay rent runs with the land, then why doesn’t a promise
designed to assure that

the lessee pays the rent also run with the land? Is the
problem again that the security deposit is not being kept (to satisfy unpaid
rent) but rather is sought

to be returned? But again, isn’t the promise to return the
deposit necessary to get the money in the first place and hold it as security
in the event of

nonpayment of rent? However questionable its reasoning might
be, the principal case apparently reflects the majority view that a promise to
return a

security deposit does not run with the land.

```

```

5 .Is the problem here that the original lessor, North
Pacific World Trade Center, Ltd., very likely put the security deposit in its
bank account, and

is now bankrupt (and probably dissolved)? North Pacific
received a windfall which cannot be recovered. But why, as between the lessee
and the

successor lessor, should the lessee be stuck with funding
the windfall for the predecessor lessor?

Assignment and Sublease

Although lease law was not part of the original scheme of
feudalism that gave rise to the system of estates in land studied in Chapter V,
it

contains analytical elements that are probably closer to
feudalism than any other feature of property law. This emerges most clearly
with respect

to transfers of lessee interests. The law recognizes two
types of transfers of lessee interests: sublease and assignment. A sublease
operates very

much like subinfeudation: The lessor starts with a fee
simple; the lessor carves out a lease for the prime lessee from the fee simple;
then the

prime lessee carves out a sublease for the sublessee from
the prime lease; then the sublessee carves out a sub-sublease for the
sub-sublessee from

the sublease, and so on. Each of the “carving outs” creates
an interest of somewhat lesser extent than the interest from which it is taken.
An

assignment, in contrast, operates very much like alienation:
The lessor starts with a fee simple; the lessor carves out a lease for the
prime lessee

from the fee simple; then the prime lessee alienates the
prime lease to a first assignee; then the first assignee alienates the prime
lease to a second

assignee, and so forth. After the initial creation of the
prime lease, there is no “carving out” here; rather the prime lease as a whole
is transferred

to successive assignees, each of which then steps into the
shoes of her assignor. The distinction is illustrated in Figure 6-5.

The distinction between sublease and assignment is important
because it affects the identity of the party that the lessor and the lessee in

possession must deal with when problems arise in the ongoing
relationship under the lease. A sublease is like a feudal hierarchy of lords
and

tenants; each lord deals with the tenant immediately below
in the hierarchy, and each tenant deals with the lord immediately above. Thus,
the

original landlord/lessor would deal with the prime lessee,
and the prime lessee with the sublessee. But the original lessor would not deal
with the

sublessee, nor the sublessee with the original lessor. At
least in theory, each chain in the hierarchy has its own separate lease
(sublease, sub-

sublease, etc.) that defines the rights and obligations
between the particular pair of parties to that instrument. With an assignment,
in contrast, the

assignee steps into the shoes of the prime lessee, and as
such enters into direct relations with the original lessor. After an assignment
takes place,

the original lessee drops out of the picture, at least
insofar as having any direct responsibility for what happens on the property.
So after a series

of assignments, there are still only two parties who deal
with the property: the original lessor and the latest assignee.

#698

Figure 6-5

Sublease and Assignment

Things are slightly more complicated than this, especially
on the assignment side, because lawyers over the years have said that there are

two sources of lease obligation: privity of estate and
privity of contract. Privity of contract is easier to understand, so let’s
start there. The

obligations that derive from privity of contract are simply
the obligations that come from being a party to a binding bilateral contract,
in this case,

a lease. So if the original lessor and the prime lessee
enter into a lease, they are both bound by privity of contract. If the prime
lessee and the

sublessee enter into a sublease, they are both bound by
privity of contract. But if the lessor and the sublessee have not entered into
any

contractual relationship with each other, they are not bound
by privity of contract. One can often identify the parties bound by privity of
contract,

and who they are bound with, simply by looking at the leases
and seeing who has signed which lease.

The source of the obligations that derive from privity of
estate is more mystical. Two conditions must be met for privity of estate to
apply.

First, the parties to be bound must have interests such that
one is directly carved out of the interest of the other. One might say that the
parties

must have interests that are directly “nested” with each
other. Second, one of the parties must be in actual possession of the property
or have a

reversion. If these conditions are satisfied, then the
parties are bound by privity of estate in addition to privity of contract. So
for example, in the

sublease hierarchy, the original lessor is in privity of
estate with the prime lessee as long as the prime lessee is in possession

#699

of the property, and the prime lessee is in privity of
estate with the lessor. If the prime lessee subleases to a sublessee, and the
sublessee is in

possession, then the prime lessee is in privity of estate
with the sublessee, and the sublessee with the prime lessee, but the original
lessor is not in

privity of estate with the sublessee, nor is the sublessee
in privity of estate with the original lessor, because the sublessee’s interest
is not carved

directly out of the lessor’s interest.

“So what?,” you are probably demanding to know. So far it
sounds like privity of contract and privity of estate cover exactly the same

people—and they do, on the sublease side of things. But when
we get to assignments, we begin to see how the distinction becomes relevant.

Suppose the original lessor enters into a lease with the
prime lessee. They are in both privity of contract and privity of estate. Then
the prime

lessee enters into a contract to assign the lease to the
first assignee. The assignment does not destroy the contractual relationship
between the

original lessor and the prime lessee—they are still in
privity of contract. But there is no contractual relationship between the
original lessor and

the first assignee, and so there is no privity of contract
between the original lessor and the first assignee. However, the first assignee
has now

stepped into the shoes of the prime lessee, and holds an
interest—the prime leasehold interest—that is directly carved out of (is nested
with) the

lessor’s interest, and the first assignee is now in
possession of the property. So the original lessor and the first assignee are
in privity of estate.

How do we know what sorts of obligations exist between two
parties—like the original lessor and the first assignee in our example—who

are in privity of estate but not privity of contract? Where
is the document, analogous to the written lease we look to in determining the

obligations entailed by privity of contract—which tells us
what obligations are entailed by privity of estate? Answer: We look to the
lease that

defines the original leasehold interest, and we impose on
the parties those covenants that run with the land. And which covenants run
with the

land? By now you should have guessed the answer: those
covenants that “touch and concern” the land. In other words, we apply the same
(rather

mysterious) methodology that the Mullendore Theatres court
used to determine which provisions of the lease bind a successor lessor, in
order to

determine which provisions of the lease bind a successor
lessee in an assignment of the lessee’s interest. Perfect symmetry! See
Restatement

(Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant § 16.1(2) (same
test on both landlord and tenant side for whether transferee is bound by
promises in

the original lease).

Consider for a moment some of the practical implications of
all this. If you are a lessor, and your prime lessee wants to exit from the

relationship before the end of the lease, which is better: a
sublease or an assignment? To some extent, it depends on how active you are in
the

management of the property. If you are inactive, you may
prefer a

#700

sublease, because now the prime lessee will serve as the
lessor to the sublessee, collecting rents, answering complaints about broken
plumbing,

and so forth. But if you are actively involved in
management—say you are the lessor of a multi-unit apartment building—an
assignment is

probably better. With an assignment, the tenant in
possession owes a duty to pay rent and perform other obligations that run with
the land directly

to you under privity of estate. And if for some reason the
new lessee defaults, the prime lessee is still on the hook to you under privity
of

contract. The prime lessee acts as a surety for the
performance of obligations by the assignee, as it were. If you are a lessee and
you want to exit

from the lease before the end of the term, somewhat similar
considerations apply. You cannot escape from your obligations to the lessor;
you will

be stuck with privity of contract and estate under a
sublease, and with privity of contract under an assignment. But an assignment
may be

preferable if you have no intention of returning to the
property or otherwise remaining engaged in some aspect of its functioning,
since under a

sublease the new lessee must deal with you as lessor,
whereas under an assignment the new lessee deals with the lessor, leaving you
off the hook

at least for management responsibilities.

If this were not complicated enough, there are two other
concepts that are also relevant in the assignment context: assumption and
novation.

Assume that a lessor enters into a lease with a prime
lessee, who then assigns the lease to the first assignee. An assumption would
occur if the

first assignee expressly agrees as part of an assignment
agreement to be bound by the terms of the original lease. In effect, when an
assignee

makes an assumption, the assignee contractually agrees to be
bound by privity of contract as well as by privity of estate. In the event of
an

assignment with an assumption, the prime tenant is still
bound by privity of contract, meaning that there are now two parties bound by
privity of

contract with the landlord. A novation occurs when the
parties agree to erase any privity of contract liability on the part of the
prime lessee. Thus,

if the prime lessee agrees to assign the lease to the first
assignee, and the lessor agrees to a novation, then the prime lessee is off the
hook

altogether. The prime lessee is no longer in privity of
estate, and the novation erases the prime lessee’s privity of contract. The
first assignee is

bound by privity of estate, or if the first assignee has
agreed to an assumption, by both privity of estate and privity of contract.
Assumption and

novation operate independently. One can have an assumption
without a novation, or a novation without an assumption, or one can have both
or

neither. Careful drafting is critical to make sure that the
right outcome is achieved by the parties involved.

#### Jaber v. Miller

```



Supreme Court of Arkansas, 1951.



239 S.W. 2 d 760.



```

■ GEORGE
ROSE SMITH, JUSTICE. This is a suit brought by Miller to obtain cancellation of
fourteen promissory notes, each in the sum of $175, held

by the appellant, Jaber. The plaintiff’s theory is that
these notes represent monthly rent upon a certain business building in Fort
Smith for the

period beginning January 1, 1950, and ending March 1, 1951.
The building was destroyed by fire on December 3, 1949, and the plaintiff

contends that his obligation to pay rent then terminated.
The defendant contends that the notes were given not for rent but as deferred
payments

for the assignment of a lease formerly held by Jaber. The
chancellor, in an opinion reflecting a careful study of the matter, concluded
that the

notes were intended to be rental payments and therefore
should be canceled.

In 1945 Jaber rented the building from its owner for a
five-year term beginning March 1, 1946, and ending March 1, 1951. The lease

reserved a monthly rent of $200 and provided that the lease
would terminate if the premises were destroyed by fire. Jaber conducted a rug
shop

in the building until 1949, when he sold his stock of
merchandise at public auction and transferred the lease to Norber & Son.
Whether this

instrument of transfer is an assignment or a sublease is the
pivotal issue in this case.

In form the document is an assignment rather than a
sublease. It is entitled “Contract and Assignment.” After reciting the
existence of the

five-year lease the instrument provides that Jaber “hereby
transfers and assigns” to Norber & Son “the aforesaid lease contract * * *
for the

remainder of the term of said lease.” It also provides that
“in consideration of the sale and assignment of said lease contract” Norber
& Son have

paid Jaber $700 in cash and have executed five promissory
notes for $700 each, due serially at specified four-month intervals. Norber
& Son

agree to pay to the owner of the property the stipulated
rental of $200 a month, and Jaber reserves the right to retake possession if
Norber & Son

fail to pay the rent or the notes. The instrument contains
no provision governing the rights of the parties in case the building is
destroyed by fire.

Later on the plaintiff, Miller, obtained a transfer of the
lease from Norber & Son. Miller, being unable to pay the $700 notes as they
came

due, arranged with Jaber to divide the payments into monthly
installments of $175 each. He and the Norbers accordingly executed the notes
now

in controversy, which Jaber accepted in substitution for
those of the original notes that were still unpaid. When the premises burned
Miller

contended that Jaber’s transfer to Norber & Son had been
a sublease rather than an assignment and that the notes therefore represented
rent.

Miller now argues that, under the rule that a sublease

#702

terminates when the primary lease terminates, his sublease
ended when the fire had the effect of terminating the original lease.

In most jurisdictions the question of whether an instrument
is an assignment or a sublease is determined by principles applicable to feudal

tenures. In a line of cases beginning in the year 1371 the
English courts worked out the rules for distinguishing between an assignment
and a

sublease. See Ferrier, Can There be a Sublease for the
Entire Term?, 18 Calif.L.Rev. 1. The doctrine established in England is quite
simple: If the

instrument purports to transfer the lessee’s estate for the
entire remainder of the term it is an assignment, regardless of its form or of
the parties’

intention. Conversely, if the instrument purports to
transfer the lessee’s estate for less than the entire term—even for a day
less—it is a sublease,

regardless of its form or of the parties’ intention.

The arbitrary distinction drawn at common law is manifestly
at variance with the usual conception of assignments and subleases. We think

of an assignment as the outright transfer of all or part of
an existing lease, the assignee stepping into the shoes of the assignor. A
sublease, on the

other hand, involves the creation of a new tenancy between
the sublessor and the sublessee, so that the sublessor is both a tenant and a
landlord.

The common law distinction is logical only in the light of
feudal property law.

In feudal times every one except the king held land by
tenure from some one higher in the hierarchy of feudal ownership. “The king
himself

holds land which is in every sense his own; no one else has
any proprietary right in it; but if we leave out of account this royal demesne,
then

every acre of land is ‘ held of ’ the king. The person whom
we may call its owner, the person who has the right to use and abuse the land,
to

cultivate it or leave it uncultivated, to keep all others
off it, holds the land of the king either immediately or mediately. In the
simplest case he

holds it immediately of the king; only the king and he have
rights in it. But it well may happen that between him and the king there stand
other

persons; Z holds immediately of Y , who holds of X , who
holds of V , who holds * * * of A , who holds of the king.” Pollock and
Maitland, History

of English Law (2d Ed.), vol. I, p. 232. In feudal law each
person owed duties, such as that of military service or the payment of rent, to
his

overlord. To enforce these duties the overlord had the
remedy of distress, being the seizure of chattels found on the land.

It is evident that in feudal theory a person must himself
have an estate in the land in order to maintain his place in the structure of

ownership. Hence if a tenant transferred his entire term he
parted with his interest in the property. The English courts therefore held
that the

transferee of the entire term held of the original lessor,
that such a transferee was bound by the covenants in the original lease, and
that he was

entitled to enforce whatever duties that lease imposed upon
the landlord. The intention of the parties had nothing to do with the matter;

#703

the sole question was whether the first lessee retained a
reversion that enabled him to hold his place in the chain of ownership.

The injustice of these inflexible rules has often been
pointed out. Suppose that A makes a lease to B for a certain rental. B then
executes to C

what both parties intend to be a sublease as that term is
generally understood, but the sublease is for the entire term. If C in good
faith pays his

rent to B , as the contract requires, he does so at his
peril. For the courts say that the contract is really an assignment, and
therefore C ’s primary

obligation is to A if the latter elects to accept C as his
tenant. Consequently A can collect the rent from the subtenant even though the
sublessor

has already been paid. For a fuller discussion of this
possibility of double liability on the part of the subtenant see Darling, Is a
Sublease for the

Residue of a Lessee’s Term in Effect an Assignment?, 16
Amer.L.Rev. 16, 21. * * *

A decided majority of the American courts have adopted the
English doctrine in its entirety. Tiffany, Landlord & Tenant, § 151. A
minority

of our courts have made timid but praiseworthy attempts to
soften the harshness of the common law rule. In several jurisdictions the
courts

follow the intention of the parties in controversies between
the sublessor and the sublessee, thus preserving the inequities of feudal times
only

when the original landlord is concerned. Johnson v. Moxley,
113 So. 656 (Ala. 1927); Saling v. Flesch, 277 P. 612 (Mont. 1929); Mausert v.

Feigenspan, 63 A. 610 (N.J. 1906); Hobbs v. Cawley, 299 P.
1073 (N.M. 1931).

In other jurisdictions the courts have gone as far as
possible to find something that might be said to constitute a reversion in what
the parties

intended to be a sublease. In some States, notably
Massachusetts, it has been held that if the sublessor reserves a right of
re-entry for nonpayment

of rent this is a sufficient reversionary estate to make the
instrument a sublease. Dunlap v. Bullard, 131 Mass. 161 (1881); Davis v. Vidal,
151

S.W. 290 (Tex. 1912). But even these decisions have been
criticized on the ground that at common law a right of re-entry was a mere
chose in

action instead of a reversionary estate. See, for example,
Tiffany, supra, § 151.

The appellee urges us to follow the Massachusetts rule and
to hold that since Jaber reserved rights of re-entry his transfer to Norber
& Son

was a sublease. We are not in sympathy with this view. It
may be true that a right of re-entry for condition broken has now attained the
status of

an estate in Arkansas. See Moore v. Sharpe, 121 S.W. 341
(Ark. 1909); Core, Transmissibility of Certain Contingent Future Interests, 5

Ark.L.Rev. 11 1. Even so, the Massachusetts rule was adopted
to carry out the intention of parties who thought they were making a sublease

rather than an assignment. Here the instrument is in form an
assignment, and it would be an obvious perversion of the rule to apply it as a
means

of defeating intention. * * *

#704

In this state of the law we do not feel compelled to adhere
to an unjust rule which was logical only in the days of feudalism. The
execution

of leases is a very practical matter that occurs a hundred
times a day without legal assistance. The layman appreciates the common sense

distinction between a sublease and an assignment, but he
would not even suspect the existence of the common law distinction. As Darling,
supra,

puts it: “Every one knows that a tenant may in turn let to
others, and the latter thereby assumes no obligations to the owner of the
property; but

who would guess that this could only be done for a time
falling short by something—a day or an hour is sufficient—of the whole term?
And

who, not familiar with the subject of feudal tenures, could
give a reason why it is held to be so?” It was of such a situation that Holmes
was

thinking when he said: “It is revolting to have no better
reason for a rule than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is
still more

revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have
vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the
past.” The

Path of the Law, 10 Harv.L.Rev. 457, 469. The rule now in
question was laid down some years before the reign of Henry IV.

The English distinction between an assignment and a sublease
is not a rule of property in the sense that titles or property rights depend
upon

its continued existence. A lawyer trained in common law
technicalities can prepare either instrument without fear that it will be
construed to be

the other. But for the less skilled lawyer or for the layman
the common law rule is simply a trap that leads to hardship and injustice by
refusing to

permit the parties to accomplish the result they seek.

For these reasons we adopt as the rule in this State the
principle that the intention of the parties is to govern in determining whether
an

instrument is an assignment or a sublease. If, for example,
a tenant has leased an apartment for a year and is compelled to move to another
city,

we know of no reason why he should not be able to sublease
it for a higher rent without needlessly retaining a reversion for the last day
of the

term. The duration of the primary term, as compared to the
length of the sublease, may in some instances be a factor in arriving at the
parties’

intention, but we do not think it should be the sole
consideration. The Bailey case, to the extent that it is contrary to this
opinion, is overruled.

In the case at bar it cannot be doubted that the parties
intended an assignment and not a sublease. The document is so entitled. All its

language is that of an assignment rather than that of a
sublease. The consideration is stated to be in payment for the lease and not in
satisfaction

of a tenant’s debt to his landlord. The deferred payments
are evidenced by promissory notes, which are not ordinarily given by one making
a

lease. From the appellee’s point of view it is unfortunate
that the assignment makes no provision for the contingency of a fire, but the
appellant’s

position is certainly not without equity. Jaber sold his
merchandise at public auction, and doubtless at reduced prices, in order to
vacate the

premises for his assignees. Whether he would have taken

#705

the same course had the contract provided for a cancellation
of the deferred payments in case of a fire we have no way of knowing. A
decision

either way works a hardship on the losing party. In this
situation we do not feel called upon to supply a provision in the assignment
which might

have been, but was not, demanded by the assignees.

Reversed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The court makes several assumptions that might be
challenged. First, it assumes that _Paradine v. Jane_ still describes the risk
of casualty loss as

between lessor and lessee, unless the lease provides to the
contrary. Second, it assumes that the provision in the original lease providing
for termination

in the event of destruction is not a covenant that runs with
the leasehold upon assignment to a new lessee. Third, it assumes that if a
prime lease is

terminated, a sublease is also terminated. Which if any of
these assumptions do you think is questionable? What would be the effect on the
result in the

case if any of these assumptions was reversed?

2 .Although the court announces that it is foreswearing
formalism and instead will enforce the intentions of the parties, it appears
that the court still

assumes that the inquiry into intent will reveal either that
the parties intended an assignment or intended a sublease, one or the other.
The court does not

contemplate the possibility that the analysis of intent
might reveal some novel set of rights and duties between transferor and
transferee that partake of

characteristics different from the standard package of
incidents one gets with either an assignment or a sublease. In this sense the
anti-formalist inquiry

into intentions is still broadly consistent with the
_numerus clausus_.

3 .The English rule described by the court, which
categorizes transfers as being either an assignment or sublease based on
whether the prime lessee

retains a reversion (even if only of one day at the end of
the prime lease), may have been derived from feudalism. But it also has the
virtue of being very

easy to apply, and hence to comply with. In opposition to
the English rule, the court endorses “the common sense distinction between a
sublease and an

assignment.” What is that? That a sublease occurs when the
prime tenant acts as a lessor toward the new lessee, and an assignment occurs
when the

prime lessee just drops out of the picture? But what sorts
of facts will be relevant in making this kind of “common sense” determination?
An all-things-

considered inquiry into the “common sense” of the situation
will entail more uncertainty. The prospect of such uncertainty, and litigation
caused by

uncertainty, could result in much more elaborately drafted
leases with lots of redundant declarations of intent superimposed on top of the
old formalism.

Are these additional drafting costs worth the benefits of
avoiding the occasional injustices cited by the _Jaber_ court?

4 .The court seems to imply that the old formalistic test
would be okay if everyone had a competent lawyer; but this cannot be assumed,
so we

need to allow courts to engage in wide-ranging examinations
of party intent. Yet if assignment and subletting occur primarily in commercial
lease

contexts,

won’t the parties nearly always be represented by counsel?
Should legal rules be devised on the assumption that some significant
percentage of parties

advised by counsel will be advised incompetently?

5 .Note that in the event of an assignment without an
assumption by the new tenant of the original lease between the lessor and the
original lessee,

the test for which covenants in the original lease are
binding as between the landlord and the new tenant is the same as the test for
determining which

lease covenants carry over upon the sale of the reversion by
the original lessor—those covenants which touch and concern the land. Does this
mean, on

the reasoning of _Mullendore Theatres_ , that the original
lessor is not obliged to return a security deposit paid by the original lessee
to the new lessee on

the termination of the lease?

■
BROUSSARD, JUSTICE. This case concerns the effect of a provision in a
commercial lease^1 that the lessee may not assign the lease or sublet the

premises without the lessor’s prior written consent. The
question we address is whether, in the absence of a provision that such consent
will not

be unreasonably withheld, a lessor may unreasonably and
arbitrarily withhold his or her consent to an assignment.^2 This is a question
of first

impression in this court.

I.

* * * The allegations of the complaint may be summarized as
      follows. The lease at issue is for 14,400 square feet of hangar space at the
      San

Jose Municipal Airport. The City of San Jose, as owner of
the property, leased it to Irving and Janice Perlitch, who in turn assigned
their interest

to respondent Ernest Pestana, Inc. Prior to assigning their
interest to respondent, the Perlitches entered into a 25-year sublease with one
Robert

Bixler commencing on January 1, 1970. The sublease covered
an original five-year term plus four 5-year options to renew. The rental rate
was to

be increased every 10 years in the same proportion as rents
increased on the master lease from the City of San Jose. The premises were to
be

used by Bixler for the purpose of conducting an airplane
maintenance business.

Bixler conducted such a business under the name “Flight
Services” until, in 1981, he agreed to sell the business to appellants Jack
Kendall,

Grady O’Hara and Vicki O’Hara. The proposed sale included
the business and the equipment, inventory and improvements on the property,

together with the existing lease. The proposed assignees had
a stronger

#707

financial statement and greater net worth than the current
lessee, Bixler, and they were willing to be bound by the terms of the lease.

The lease provided that written consent of the lessor was
required before the lessee could assign his interest, and that failure to
obtain such

consent rendered the lease voidable at the option of the
lessor.^5 Accordingly, Bixler requested consent from the Perlitches’
successor-in-interest,

respondent Ernest Pestana, Inc. Respondent refused to
consent to the assignment and maintained that it had an absolute right
arbitrarily to refuse

any such request. The complaint recites that respondent
demanded “increased rent and other more onerous terms” as a condition of
consenting to

Bixler’s transfer of interest.

The proposed assignees brought suit for declaratory and
injunctive relief and damages seeking, inter alia, a declaration “that the
refusal of

ERNEST PESTANA, INC. to consent to the assignment of the
lease is unreasonable and is an unlawful restraint on the freedom of

alienation... .” The trial court sustained a demurrer to the
complaint without leave to amend and this appeal followed.

II.

The law generally favors free alienability of property, and
California follows the common law rule that a leasehold interest is freely

alienable. Contractual restrictions on the alienability of
leasehold interests are, however, permitted. “Such restrictions are justified
as reasonable

protection of the interests of the lessor as to who shall
possess and manage property in which he has a reversionary interest and from
which he is

deriving income.” (Schoshinski, American Law of Landlord and
Tenant § 8:15, at pp. 578–579 (1980)).

The common law’s hostility toward restraints on alienation
has caused such restraints on leasehold interests to be strictly construed
against

the lessor. [ Chapman v. Great Western Gypsum Co. , 14 P.2d
758, 760 (Cal. 1932).] This is particularly true where the restraint in
question is a

“forfeiture restraint,” under which the lessor has the
option to terminate the lease if an assignment is made without his or her
consent. (See

Karbelnig v. Brothwell, 53 Cal.Rptr. 335, 340 (Cal. App.
1966); Civ.Code, § 1442 [“A condition involving a forfeiture must be strictly

interpreted against the party for whose benefit it is
created.”]; 2 Powell on Real Property, ¶ 246[1], at pp. 372.100–372.101.)

#708

Nevertheless, a majority of jurisdictions have long adhered
to the rule that where a lease contains an approval clause (a clause stating
that

the lease cannot be assigned without the prior consent of
the lessor), the lessor may arbitrarily refuse to approve a proposed assignee
no matter

how suitable the assignee appears to be and no matter how
unreasonable the lessor’s objection. The harsh consequences of this rule have
often

been avoided through application of the doctrines of waiver
and estoppel, under which the lessor may be found to have waived (or be
estopped

from asserting) the right to refuse consent to assignment.

The traditional majority rule has come under steady attack
in recent years. A growing minority of jurisdictions now hold that where a
lease

provides for assignment only with the prior consent of the
lessor, such consent may be withheld only where the lessor has a commercially

reasonable objection to the assignment, even in the absence
of a provision in the lease stating that consent to assignment will not be

unreasonably withheld.

For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the
minority rule is the preferable position. * * *

III.

The impetus for change in the majority rule has come from
two directions, reflecting the dual nature of a lease as a conveyance of a

leasehold interest and a contract. (See Medico-Dental Bldg.
Co. v. Horton & Converse, 132 P.2d 457 (Cal. 1942).) The policy against
restraints

on alienation pertains to leases in their nature as
conveyances. Numerous courts and commentators have recognized that “[i]n recent
times the

necessity of permitting reasonable alienation of commercial
space has become paramount in our increasingly urban society.” (Schweiso v.

Williams, 198 Cal. Rptr. 238, 240 (Cal. App. 1984)). * * *

One commentator explains as follows: “The common-law
hostility to restraints on alienation had a large exception with respect to
estates

for years. A lessor could prohibit the lessee from
transferring the estate for years to whatever extent he might desire. It was
believed that the

objectives served by allowing such restraints outweighed the
social evils implicit in the restraints, in that they gave to the lessor a
needed control

over the person entrusted with the lessor’s property and to
whom he must look for the performance of the covenants contained in the lease.

Whether this reasoning retains full validity can well be
doubted. Relationships between lessor and lessee have tended to become more and
more

impersonal. Courts have considerably lessened the
effectiveness of restraint clauses by strict construction and liberal
applications of the doctrine

of waiver. With the shortage of housing and, in many places,
of commercial space as well, the allowance of lease clauses forbidding
assignments

and subleases is beginning to be curtailed by statutes.” (2
Powell, supra, ¶ 246[1], at pp. 372.97–372.98, fns. omitted.) * * *

#709

The second impetus for change in the majority rule comes
from the nature of a lease as a contract. As the Court of Appeal observed in

Cohen v. Ratinoff , 195 Cal.Rptr. 84 (Cal. App. 1983),
“[s]ince Richard v. Degan & Brody, Inc. [espousing the majority rule] was
decided,...

there has been an increased recognition of and emphasis on
the duty of good faith and fair dealing inherent in every contract.” (Id. at
88.) Thus,

“[i]n every contract there is an implied covenant that
neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or
injuring the right

of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract...
.” (Universal Sales Corp. v. Cal. Press Mfg. Co., 128 P.2d 665, 677 (Cal.
1942)). * * *

Here the lessor retains the discretionary power to approve
or disapprove an assignee proposed by the other party to the contract; this

discretionary power should therefore be exercised in
accordance with commercially reasonable standards. “Where a lessee is entitled
to sublet

under common law, but has agreed to limit that right by
first acquiring the consent of the landlord, we believe the lessee has a right
to expect that

consent will not be unreasonably withheld.” (Fernandez v.
Vazquez, 397 So.2d 1171, 1174 (Fla. Ct. App. 1981).)^15

Under the minority rule, the determination whether a
lessor’s refusal to consent was reasonable is a question of fact. Some of the
factors that

the trier of fact may properly consider in applying the
standards of good faith and commercial reasonableness are: financial
responsibility of the

proposed assignee; suitability of the use for the particular
property; legality of the proposed use; need for alteration of the premises;
and nature of

the occupancy, i.e., office, factory, clinic, etc.

Denying consent solely on the basis of personal taste,
convenience or sensibility is not commercially reasonable. Nor is it reasonable
to

deny consent “in order that the landlord may charge a higher
rent than originally contracted for.” (Schweiso v. Williams, 198 Cal. Rptr.
238, 240

(Cal. App. 1984)). This is because the lessor’s desire for a
better bargain than contracted for has nothing to do with the permissible
purposes of

the restraint on alienation—to protect the lessor’s interest
in the preservation of the property and the performance of the lease covenants.
“ ‘[T]he

clause is for the protection of the landlord in its
ownership and operation of the particular property —not for its general
economic protection.’ ”

(Ringwood Associates, Ltd. v. Jack’s of Route 23, Inc., 379
A.2d 508, 512 (N.J. Super. 1977 ), quoting Krieger v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc., 302
A.2d

129 (N.J. 1973), italics added.)

In contrast to the policy reasons advanced in favor of the
minority rule, the majority rule has traditionally been justified on three
grounds.

#710

Respondent raises a fourth argument in its favor as well.
None of these do we find compelling.

First, it is said that a lease is a conveyance of an
interest in real property, and that the lessor, having exercised a personal
choice in the

selection of a tenant and provided that no substitute shall
be acceptable without prior consent, is under no obligation to look to anyone
but the

lessee for the rent. This argument is based on traditional
rules of conveyancing and on concepts of freedom of ownership and control over
one’s

property.

A lessor’s freedom at common law to look to no one but the
lessee for the rent has, however, been undermined by the adoption in California

of a rule that lessors—like all other contracting
parties—have a duty to mitigate damages upon the lessee’s abandonment of the
property by

seeking a substitute lessee. (See Civ.Code, § 1 951.2.)
Furthermore, the values that go into the personal selection of a lessee are
preserved under

the minority rule in the lessor’s right to refuse consent to
assignment on any commercially reasonable grounds. Such grounds include not
only

the obvious objections to an assignee’s financial stability
or proposed use of the premises, but a variety of other commercially reasonable

objections as well. (See, e.g., Arrington v. Walter E.
Heller Int’l Corp., 333 N.E.2d 50 (Ill. App. 1975) [desire to have only one
“lead tenant” in

order to preserve “image of the building” as tenant’s
international headquarters]; Warmack v. Merchants Nat’l Bank of Fort Smith, 612
S.W.2d

733 (Ark. 1 981) [desire for good “tenant mix” in shopping
center]; List v. Dahnke 638 P.2d 824 (Colo. App. 1981) [lessor’s refusal to
consent to

assignment of lease by one restaurateur to another was
reasonable where lessor believed proposed specialty restaurant would not
succeed at that

location].) The lessor’s interests are further protected by
the fact that the original lessee remains a guarantor of the performance of the
assignee.

The second justification advanced in support of the majority
rule is that an approval clause is an unambiguous reservation of absolute

discretion in the lessor over assignments of the lease. The
lessee could have bargained for the addition of a reasonableness clause to the
lease

(i.e., “consent to assignment will not be unreasonably
withheld”). The lessee having failed to do so, the law should not rewrite the
parties’

contract for them.

Numerous authorities have taken a different view of the
meaning and effect of an approval clause in a lease, indicating that the clause
is not

“clear and unambiguous,” as respondent suggests. [Citing and
quoting Granite Trust Bldg. Corp. v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., 36
F.Supp.

77, 78 (D. Mass. 1940); Gamble v. New Orleans Housing Mart,
Inc., 154 So.2d 625, 627 (La. App. 1963); In Shaker Bldg. Co. v. Federal Lime

and Stone Co., 277 N.E.2d 584, 587 (Ohio Mun. 1971).]

In light of the interpretations given to approval clauses in
the cases cited above, and in light of the increasing number of jurisdictions
that

have adopted the minority rule in the last 15 years, the
assertion that an

#711

approval clause “clearly and unambiguously” grants the
lessor absolute discretion over assignments is untenable. It is not a rewriting
of a

contract, as respondent suggests, to recognize the
obligations imposed by the duty of good faith and fair dealing, which duty is
implied by law in

every contract.

The third justification advanced in support of the majority
rule is essentially based on the doctrine of stare decisis. It is argued that
the

courts should not depart from the common law majority rule
because “many leases now in effect covering a substantial amount of real
property

and creating valuable property rights were carefully
prepared by competent counsel in reliance upon the majority viewpoint.” (Gruman
v.

Investors Diversified Services, 78 N.W.2d 377 (Minn. 1956).)
As pointed out above, however, the majority viewpoint has been far from

universally held and has never been adopted by this court.
Moreover, the trend in favor of the minority rule should come as no surprise to

observers of the changing state of real property law in the
20th century. The minority rule is part of an increasing recognition of the
contractual

nature of leases and the implications in terms of
contractual duties that flow therefrom. (See Green v. Superior Court, 517 P.2d
1 168, 1 172–73

(Cal. 1974).) We would be remiss in our duty if we declined
to question a view held by the majority of jurisdictions simply because it is
held by a

majority. As we stated in Rodriguez v. Bethlehem Steel Corp.
, 525 P.2d 669 (Cal. 1974), the “vitality [of the common law] can flourish only
so

long as the courts remain alert to their obligation and
opportunity to change the common law when reason and equity demand it.” (Id. at
676.)

A final argument in favor of the majority rule is advanced
by respondent and stated as follows: “Both tradition and sound public policy

dictate that the lessor has a right, under circumstances
such as these, to realize the increased value of his property.” Respondent
essentially argues

that any increase in the market value of real property
during the term of a lease properly belongs to the lessor, not the lessee. We
reject this

assertion. One California commentator has written: “[W]hen
the lessee executed the lease he acquired the contractual right for the
exclusive use

of the premises, and all of the benefits and detriment
attendant to possession, for the term of the contract. He took the downside
risk that he

would be paying too much rent if there should be a
depression in the rental market.... Why should he be deprived of the
contractual benefits of

the lease because of the fortuitous inflation in the
marketplace[?] By reaping the benefits he does not deprive the landlord of
anything to which

the landlord was otherwise entitled. The landlord agreed to
dispose of possession for the limited term and he could not reasonably
anticipate any

more than what was given to him by the terms of the lease.
His reversionary estate will benefit from the increased value from the
inflation in any

event, at least upon the expiration of the lease.” (Miller
& Starr, Current Law of Cal. Real Estate 1984 Supp., § 27:92 at p. 321
(1977).)

#712

Respondent here is trying to get more than it bargained for
in the lease. A lessor is free to build periodic rent increases into a lease,
as the

lessor did here. Any increased value of the property beyond
this “belongs” to the lessor only in the sense, as explained above, that the
lessor’s

reversionary estate will benefit from it upon the expiration
of the lease. We must therefore reject respondent’s argument in this regard.^17

---

IV.

In conclusion, both the policy against restraints on
alienation and the implied contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing
militate in favor

of adoption of the rule that where a commercial lease
provides for assignment only with the prior consent of the lessor, such consent
may be

withheld only where the lessor has a commercially reasonable
objection to the assignee or the proposed use. Under this rule, appellants have

stated a cause of action against respondent Ernest Pestana,
Inc.

■ LUCAS,
JUSTICE, dissenting. I respectfully dissent. In my view we should follow the
weight of authority which, as acknowledged by the majority

herein, allows the commercial lessor to withhold his consent
to an assignment or sublease arbitrarily or without reasonable cause. The
majority’s

contrary ruling, requiring a “commercially reasonable
objection” to the assignment, can only result in a proliferation of unnecessary
litigation.

---

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The economic reality that underlies the dispute in the
principal case is that market rents for hangar space at regional airports in
California had

undoubtedly risen significantly relative to the rent
reserved under the prime lease. Leasing professionals refer to this as the
“bonus value” of a lease. It is

simply the difference between the rent reserved and the rent
obtainable in the leasing market at any given point in time. There are two ways
for the

original transacting parties to try to capture a positive
bonus value. If the lessor is permitted to terminate the original lease and
enter into a new lease at

market rents, the lessor can capture the bonus.
Alternatively, if the lessee is permitted to assign or sublet the original
lease, the lessee can assign the lease

in return for a lump sum payment or can sublease at a higher
rent and thereby capture the bonus. Economically speaking, the issue in the
case is which

party—lessor or lessee—is entitled to capture the bonus
value under the terms of the prime lease. The lessor’s position is that the
lease entitles the lessor

(under established California law) to block the lessee from
assigning or subletting for any reason or no reason, so the lessor is entitled
to capture the

bonus as a condition of giving consent to assignment or
subletting. The lessee’s position is that as long as the prime lease remains in
force, the lessor has

no way unilaterally to capture the bonus; only the

```



713



```

lessee can capture the bonus by assigning or subletting, so
the bonus rightly belongs to the lessee. Do you agree with the court’s analysis
as to how the

right to capture the “bonus” is allocated under the lease?

2 .Given that the court is addressing only commercial
leases, and that the parties who enter into commercial leases like the one
involved in the

principal case usually act on advice of counsel, what is the
justification for flipping the default rule and awarding the bonus to the
lessee (unless the

parties have explicitly allowed the lessor to refuse consent
for any reason) rather than the lessor (unless the parties constrain the
landlord’s discretion by

requiring a commercially reasonable ground for refusing
consent)? Does the Coase theorem (Chapter I) suggest that the parties will
bargain around

whatever default rule is established to reach the rule that
maximizes their joint welfare? If that is the case, does the decision
constitute a one-time

windfall for lessees under long-term commercial leases
negotiated under the assumption that the old default rule would apply?

3 .Recall that leases often function as a mechanism for
managing complexes of assets shared by multiple lessees. Does the decision
here—

requiring that lessors give judicially reviewable reasons
for refusing to consent to subleases or assignments unless they expressly
reserve the right to act

unreasonably—enhance or undermine the lessor’s ability to
govern a multi-lessee complex?

other casualty, give immediate notice thereof to the Lessor, who shall

thereupon cause the damage to be repaired as soon as it is
reasonable and convenient for the Lessor, but if the Apartment be so damaged
that the

Lessor shall decide neither to rebuild nor to repair, the
term of the lease shall cease.

#715

10.Regulations. The Lessee hereby consents to and agrees to,
observe any reasonable regulation that may be and as are in effect now or as

may be promulgated from time to time. Notice of all current

conditions on the

part of the other Lessees.

1 1.Insurance. The Lessee understands and agrees that it
shall be the Lessee’s own obligation to insure his personal property located in
the

Apartment, and the lessee further understands that the
Lessor will not reimburse the Lessee for damage to the Lessee’s personal
property.

12.Recreational Facilities. The Lessee agrees that he is
renting only the Apartment. The monthly rent does not include use of any

recreational facilities of the Lessor. The use of any
recreational facilities of the Lessor may be allowed or revoked in the Lessor’s
sole discretion.

The Lessor reserves the right to promulgate reasonable rules
and regulations governing the use of recreational facilities and to establish
and

collect fees for the use thereof (and to amend such fees
from time to time) and to impose other charges from time to time to cover the
costs and

expenses of operation, maintenance and ownership of all
recreational facilities.

13.Condition of Apartment. It is agreed between the parties
that the Apartment has been rented in good order and repair. The Lessee

acknowledges that he has inspected the Apartment and the

Lessee further agrees that upon vacating the Apartment it
will be returned to a similar condition as when it was rented, reasonable wear
and tear

excepted.

14.Attorney’s Fees and Penalties. The Lessee agrees to pay
all reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses incurred as a result of any breach

additional rent a late charge amounting to 10% of his rental obligation for any
period of time

that the Lessee’s rent is more than thirty days late.

15.Complete Agreement. It is agreed, except as herein
otherwise provided, that no amendment or change or addition to this lease shall
be

binding upon the Lessor or Lessee unless reduced to writing
and signed by the parties hereto. It is hereby agreed that this is the entire
agreement

of the parties.

16.Joint and Several Obligations. If this lease is executed
by more than one person or entity as Lessee, then and in that event all the

written consent of the Lessor at the expiration of the term hereof or its

termination, then the Lessor may recover, in addition to
possession, the monthly rental stipulated above for each month, or portion
thereof,

during the Lessee’s holdover plus either one and one-half
(½) times the monthly rental or the actual damages sustained by the Lessor,
whichever

is greater, plus the Lessor’s costs of recovering said
amounts and possession, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

QUESTIONS

1 .Assume you are advising a client who is interested in
renting an apartment and who has been given this form to sign by her
prospective lessor.

The lease omits to mention certain covenants and provisions
that, as we have seen, are critical from a lessee’s perspective, such as the
covenant of quiet

enjoyment, the understanding that material covenants are
dependent, a provision calling for termination of the lease upon destruction of
the premises,

the implied warranty of habitability, and the lessor’s duty
to mitigate damages. Are any of these omissions matters of serious concern for
your client? If

so, which ones?

2 .Consider the covenants that are included in the lease.
Are there any provisions that you would advise your client to ask the lessor to
delete?

Many leases contain illegal provisions, which may misinform
lessees when a dispute arises. See Meirav Furth-Matzkin, On the Unexpected Use
of

Unenforceable Contract Terms: Evidence from the Residential
Rental

```



717



```

Market, 9 J. Legal Analysis 1 ( 2017 ). Are there any
provisions that you would advise your client to ask the lessor to modify? If
the lessor is willing to

consider a short rider to the lease, what is the one thing
you would be most anxious to add as an additional provision?

g.RENT CONTROL

The United States is relatively unusual in that rents
charged by lessors for both commercial and residential tenancies are today
largely free

of regulatory oversight by the government. Most other
countries have some form of government controls on rents, at least for
residential

tenancies. Historically, the United States has also
experienced significant episodes of rent control, such as during World War I
and World War II

and again during the period of high inflation in the 1970s
and early 1980s. As that inflationary era gave way to a period of prolonged low

inflation, rent control regimes were gradually repealed or
allowed to lapse, with only New York City and a few cities in California (such
as

Berkeley and Santa Monica) retaining rent-control regimes.
More recently, rent control is on the rise again, primarily in large cities
experiencing

an influx of new residents and associated housing shortages,
which in turn put upward pressure on rents, such as San Francisco, New York,
Los

Angeles, and Washington, D.C. Another major war or a renewed
bout of inflation would predictably give rise to more widespread pressure for a

reinstatement of rent controls.

One form of rent control is the rent freeze, which simply
prohibits lessors from increasing the rents currently being charged. When rent

controls are first imposed, as at the onset of a major war,
they typically take the form of a rent freeze. Such regimes are adopted in
response to an

anticipated surge in demand for rental housing and are
designed to prevent unexpected hardships to lessees and windfall profits for
lessors. See

Franz Hubert, Rent Control: Academic Analysis and Public
Sentiment, 10 Swedish Econ. Pol’y Rev. 61, 69 (2003). As time goes by, however,
a

rent freeze generates inequities and anomalies, especially
if prices of inputs for which lessors must pay (such as heating fuel) are not
also

controlled. Consequently, rent freezes are either suspended
after a time, or they evolve into a more permanent form of regulation that
allows for

adjustments.

Rent control regimes that last for any appreciable period of
time seek to stabilize rents rather than freeze them. Rent stabilization takes
a

variety of forms. Sometimes, as in post-War England up to
the Thatcher government or in communist China, a government authority sets a
“fair

rent” for each apartment. This can be based on a variety of
factors,

#718

including lessor costs, lessee ability to pay, or the rents
charged for comparable uncontrolled units. A more common system is called
vacancy

decontrol. This restricts rent increases while the lessee
remains in possession of a unit, usually permitting annual percentage increases
in

accordance with some index established by a regulatory body.
But when a lessee voluntarily vacates a unit, the lessor is allowed to adjust
rents to

market levels. Special exceptions may be made for increases
in cases of lessor hardship or where a lessor has made significant improvements
to

the property. New York City has a complicated system in
which rents are not decontrolled upon vacancy, but lessors find it much easier
to obtain

increases from regulators based on claims of hardship and
improvements when a tenant vacates—primarily because there is no one to object
to

the increase. Hence a kind of de facto vacancy decontrol
prevails.

Any system of rent stabilization tends to balloon into a
system of comprehensive regulation of lessor-lessee relations, turning the
rental

housing industry into a kind of public utility. The
principal reason for this is the vacancy decontrol feature. If lessors could
insist that lessees take

a one-year term of years, then the lessor could terminate
each tenancy at the end of each year and reset rents to market levels. To
prevent lessors

from doing this, rent stabilization requires that the term
of years be abolished, and that lessees be given what are in effect periodic
tenancies for

an indefinite term. But lessors still have an incentive to
induce tenants to vacate, either by withholding services or otherwise engaging
in

belligerent behavior. To counteract this, so-called
landlord-tenant courts must be given authority to scrutinize the level of
services lessors provide

and to police other types of lessor behavior. Not
surprisingly, the housing court in New York City has an enormous docket, much
larger (even

adjusting for population) than in any other major city
without rent controls. Would going to a system in which a regulatory board
establishes a

fair rent (without regard to the tenure of the lessee) solve
this problem? Or would it create other problems of equal or greater magnitude?

Economists have traditionally had nothing good to say about
rent control. One survey taken in 1992 found that when economists were asked

to respond to 40 statements related to economic policy the
greatest recorded degree of consensus (93.5 percent) was to the proposition: “A

ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality of housing
available.” Richard Arnott, Time for Revisionism in Rent Control? J. Econ.

Perspectives, Winter 1995, at 100. The simple economic
critique of rent control is as follows. If rents are fixed at levels below
market clearing

prices, then demand for rental housing will rise and the
supply of rental housing will fall. This creates a gap between the quantity of
housing

demanded and the quantity supplied. In the short run, the
gap will be closed by queuing: There will be waiting lists for housing, or
units will be

allocated based on favoritism or discrimination. In the long
run, the

#719

supply will adjust to the controlled price, either because
lessors allow the quality of housing to deteriorate, or they convert rental
units to

condominiums or otherwise take them off the market. So in
the end, rent control simply gives lessees less housing or poorer-quality
housing than

they would have if government did not intervene in setting
rents. See generally Edward L. Glaeser & Erzo F.P. Luttmer, The
Misallocation of

Housing Under Rent Control, 93 Am. Econ. Rev. 1027 (2003).

Defenders of rent control, such as Arnott, supra, point out
that this traditional critique applies with greatest force to the rent freeze.
A “well

designed” rent stabilization program will have a less
dramatic impact on lessors, because percentage increases are allowed each year.
But even a

“well designed” rent stabilization system can have serious
distorting effects on the housing market. As other economists have pointed out,

vacancy decontrol creates perverse distributional patterns,
in which tenants who have lived in the same unit for many years pay
substantially

lower rents than tenants who have recently moved to the
community or have just set up house on their own. See Kaushik Basu &
Patrick M.

Emerson, The Economics and Law of Rent Control, 110 Econ. J.
939 (2000). The folklore of rent control contains many stories about wealthy

dowagers living in spacious apartments at tiny rents, while
recent college graduates pay half of their disposable income or more for studio

apartments the size of a closet. There is also concern that
vacancy decontrol can affect the mobility of the labor market, with workers who
have

scored a favorable rent control “deal” declining to move to
another city to take up a better job because they would lose the subsidy they
enjoy

from rent control. Basu & Emerson, supra; Glaeser &
Luttmer, supra; Robert C. Ellickson, Legal Sources of Residential Lock-ins: Why
French

Households Move Half as Often as U.S. Households, 2012 U.
Ill. L. Rev. 373, 379, 388–89.

Recently economists have offered additional arguments for
rent control (of the rent stabilization variety). One argument points out that

because each apartment is unique, and because search costs
are high, each lessor enjoys a degree of localized monopoly power. Lessors may

rationally attempt to exploit this quasi-monopoly by raising
rents above levels that would prevail in a competitive market for fungible
goods, like

bushels of grain or shares of stock. Hence some tempering of
rents, through rent stabilization, can improve the efficiency of the market by

eliminating the premium lessors can exact from their
localized monopoly power. See Aaron S. Edlin, The New Palgrave : Surveying Two
Waves

of Economic Analysis of Law, 2 Am. L. & Econ. Rev. 407,
419–20 (2000). This argument, however, would seem to justify imposing price

controls on virtually any nonfungible good. For example,
freestanding homes are undoubtedly more unique than apartments, and the search
costs

of finding the right home are at least as high as those of
finding the right apartment, yet few would argue that the prices of
freestanding homes

should be regulated. As Edlin suggests, the amount and
quality of

#720

information required to use price controls to combat local
monopoly may be too great.

Other commentators who reject the economic perspective have
defended rent control on personhood and communitarian grounds. Most

notably, Margaret Jane Radin has argued that rent control
(of the vacancy decontrol variety) is justified precisely because it tends to
lock people

in to particular apartments and particular communities. See
Margaret Jane Radin, Residential Rent Control, 25 Phil. & Pub. Affairs 350
(1986).

People develop subjective attachments to their apartments,
which become an important element in their personal identities. And they form

networks of relationships in their communities, which would
be disrupted if they—or the other members of the community—were continually

moving out in response to rent increases. By providing an
additional incentive for everyone to stay put, rent control thus enhances these

personhood values. Note that this argument presents the flip
side of the concerns of Basu & Emerson, supra, about how vacancy decontrol
is

unfair to newcomers and may create rigidities in labor
markets. See generally Stephanie M. Stern, Reassessing the Citizen Virtues of

Homeownership, 111 Colum. L. Rev. 890 (2011). This is a
theme we see often in property law—how to strike the right balance between
stability

and change (see Chapter X in particular).

As is often the case, our capacity to theorize about a legal
phenomenon, in this case rent control, exceeds our empirical knowledge.

Nevertheless, a survey of empirical studies of rent control,
drawing upon 27 different studies from around the world (with New York City
being

the most frequently studied), draws some qualified
conclusions. See Bengt Turner & Stephen Malpezzi, A Review of Empirical
Evidence on the

Costs and Benefits of Rent Control, 10 Swedish Econ. Pol’y
Rev. 11 (2003). The studies show that the “transfer efficiency”—the ratio of
lessee

benefits to lessor costs—is “less than 100 percent,”
although how much less varies depending on the market. Id. at 47. Translated,
rent control

reduces the aggregate wealth of society because lessees gain
less than lessors lose. The studies also show no consistent redistributive
effects from

rich to poor. Lessors tend to be somewhat better off than
lessee, but not always, and some well-to-do lessees benefit from rent control.
Id. Other

findings, which are more qualified, are that rent control in
one sector of the housing market tends to drive up rents in other uncontrolled
sectors,

id. at 46, and that the more stringent a country’s system of
rent controls, “the less housing investment is obtained” from the private
sector. Id. A

recent study of new controls in San Francisco concludes that
lessors subject to rent controls have reduced the quantity of housing they
supply by

15%. Rebecca Diamond, Tim McQuade & Franklin Qian, The
Effects of Rent Control Expansion on Tenants, Landlords, and Inequality:

Evidence from San Francisco, 109 Am. Econ. Rev. 3365 (2019).
Do these findings, however qualified, vindicate the traditional hostility of

economists to rent control?

#721

The problematic effects of rent control have arguably been
magnified by the growth of homesharing through the internet such as Airbnb

rentals. Although systematic data are lacking, it appears
that significant numbers of lessees who live in rent-controlled apartments in
high-growth

cities like New York, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.
have “monetized” the implicit subsidy they get from controls by renting out
their

apartments to tourists and other short-term renters at
market rates. See Stephanie M. Stern, Rent Control Sharing, 13 Law & Ethics
Hum. Rts.

141, 144 (2019) (arguing that this development further
distorts the effect of rent controls on lessee mobility, “entrenches rent
control’s

distributional failings,” and further reduces “incentives
for landlords to maintain and repair property”).

Rent control has been subject to repeated constitutional
challenges ever since its initial introduction in the United States during
World War I.

In Block v. Hirsh , 256 U.S. 135 (1921), the Supreme Court
rejected a due process challenge to controls established in Washington, D.C. to
keep

rents from rising with the influx of military and government
workers during World War I. Speaking through Justice Holmes, the Court found
that

the controls satisfied a legitimate public purpose because
they were a temporary response to emergency conditions. “A limit in time, to
tide over

a passing trouble, well may justify a law that could not be
upheld as a permanent change.” Id. at 157. He noted further that “[m]achinery
is

provided to secure to the landlord a reasonable rent,” and
that on the question whether the rent was reasonable “the courts are given the
last

word.” Id. at 157 , 158. Justice McKenna, writing for four
dissenters, asked: “If such exercise of government be legal, what exercise of

government is illegal?” Id. at 161. More recently, the
Supreme Court has considered several challenges to rent stabilization schemes
but has

always upheld the challenged law. See Lingle v. Chevron USA
Inc., 544 U.S. 528 (2005); Yee v. City of Escondido, 503 U.S. 519 (1992);

Pennell v. City of San Jose, 485 U.S. 1 (1988). Indeed, the
Court has never invalidated a rent control scheme on constitutional grounds.
When the

New York legislature toughened New York City’s rent control
laws in 2019, a constitutional challenge was quickly dispatched on a motion to

dismiss. 335–7 LLC v. New York City, 524 F. Supp. 3d 316
(S.D.N.Y. 2021).

The COVID Pandemic Eviction Moratoria

The COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States with full force
in March 2020 and continued in waves of various intensity through the

balance of 2020 and all of 2021. The pandemic and various
government policies to try to stem the spread of the virus, such as lockdowns,

imposed severe economic hardship on many persons and their
families. Particularly hard hit were those dependent on work in service
industries

like restaurants, hotels, and tourism. It was feared that
many of these persons and affected business would be unable to continue to meet
their

#722

rental obligations and would face eviction and possible
homelessness. There were two possible government responses. One was to adopt

programs providing direct financial support for rental
payments, analogous to emergency programs providing expanded unemployment

compensation or general financial support to families from
the government. The other was to enact a moratorium on evictions for nonpayment
of

rent. Although some states and local governments
experimented with rent support programs, the dominant response was the
enactment of

moratoria on evictions. One reason for this policy choice
was that evictions are ordered by courts—agencies of the government (and
themselves

significantly shut down)—and thus legislation suspending
evictions was relatively easy to describe and enforce. Another reason,
presumably, is

that the cost of barring evictions would be borne by lessors
in the form of lost rental income rather than by the government.

At the federal level, Congress ordered a limited nationwide
moratorium on evictions early in the pandemic. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and

Economic Security Act (CARES Act), Pub. L. No. 1 16–136, §
4024, 134 Stat. 281 (2020). As the expiration of the moratorium approached, the

Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued its own broader
moratorium. Temporary Halt in Residential Evictions to Prevent Further the
Spread of

COVID-19, 85 Fed. Reg. 19,654 (Sept. 4, 2020). As the CDC
moratorium was in turn winding down, Congress extended it for another month.

But when that month passed with no further action from
Congress, the CDC decided to extend the moratorium without additional
congressional

authority. It justified this move based on a 1944 statute
that authorized it to issue orders for fumigation, pest extermination, and
“other measures,

as in [its] judgment may be necessary” to prevent “sources
of dangerous infection to human beings.” Public Health Service Act of 1944,
codified

as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 264(a). Various associations of
lessors sued in federal court, arguing that this language did not support a
nationwide

moratorium on evictions. Acting on applications for stays of
injunctive relief in the summer of 2021, the Supreme Court agreed, and lifted a
stay

of an injunction against the CDC order. Alabama Ass’n of
Realtors v. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., 141 S. Ct. 2485 (2021). Some
states

responded by adopting new statewide eviction moratoria, but
in most of the country lessors were again free to pursue eviction proceedings.

Were eviction moratoria a proper response to the Covid
pandemic and the economic hardship experienced by a subset of the population?

Would direct financial support to lessors, as under
Emergency Rental Assistance Programs, have been a better response? What impact
will the

moratoria have on future investment in new rental
properties, already in short supply in many major cities?

### 2 .COMMON-INTEREST COMMUNITIES

Leases are the oldest form of property that facilitates the
separation of management from interests in possession of the property, and they

remain the most common form of entity property used for
these purposes. But recent decades have witnessed a surge in the use of
alternative

forms of entity property in which multiple persons enjoy
individual possessory interests while common areas are subject to specialized

management, namely condominiums, cooperatives, and other
common-interest communities like gated private residential subdivisions. These

common interest communities differ from leases in that,
although common areas are owned and managed by some entity that specializes in

oversight of these common areas, the persons who obtain
individual possessory rights in these complexes have ownership interests that
can be

described as equivalent to a fee simple. See Restatement
(Third) of Property: Servitudes § 1.8 (2000). Approximately 74 million persons
in the

U.S. now live in some form of common interest community,
about 22.5 percent of the population, and the number continues to grow.

Because the individual possessory rights in cooperatives,
condominiums, and common-interest communities are functionally equivalent to a

fee simple, these property forms are not used as financing
or risk-spreading devices the way leases often are. One can find isolated
farms,

restaurants, and single-family homes that are leased,
because the lessee does not want (or is not wealthy enough) to sink significant
capital into

acquiring the necessary possessory rights in fee simple. But
one will not find many isolated farms, restaurants, or single-family homes held
as

cooperatives, condominiums, or common interest communities.
This is because these property forms do not offer any financing or
risk-spreading

advantages relative to fee simple ownership. They make sense
only as a mechanism for separating management functions of common areas from

individual possessory units, and so they are only
encountered in contexts where this specialization of functions is desired.

The shared feature of all common interest communities is
that multiple persons have an undivided interest in certain common assets. The

most common example would be an apartment building, in which
multiple persons own particular apartments, but all have an undivided common

interest in the lobby, the heating plant, the elevators, and
so forth. Another example would be a residential gated community, in which
multiple

persons own free-standing homes, but all share an undivided
common interest in a fence, security office, and perhaps other facilities like
a

swimming pool or recreation room. This division of
management authority between individual possessory units and common facilities
could

equally be achieved by leasing (and often is, at least in
apartment buildings). But increasingly one finds cooperatives, condominiums,
and

common interest communities used for these purposes.

#724

The oldest of these alternative property forms is the
cooperative apartment building. The first cooperative apartment building was
built in

New York City in 1876. The popularity of this form of
housing, especially for upper income apartment dwellers, grew in fits and
starts

throughout the early decades of the twentieth century, and
eventually spread to other cities such as Washington, D.C. and Chicago. Today,
New

York is the only city with a significant number of
cooperative apartment buildings. Legally speaking, cooperatives are
corporations. The

corporation holds fee simple title to the entire complex,
including both the individual units—typically apartments—and the common
facilities.

Individuals who wish to live in the building must purchase
shares of stock in the corporation, and the corporation then leases a
designated space

to them, typically under a long-term renewable lease of 99
years. The common areas—the building shell, lobby, elevators, heating plant,
etc.—

are owned and managed by the corporation, acting through a
board of directors elected by the shareholders. Most cooperative apartments
borrow

money for construction and improvements, with the loan
secured by a mortgage on the entire building. The individual shareholders, as
the

owners of the corporation, are responsible for paying off
this debt. For this reason, cooperative apartments have always been very picky
about the

creditworthiness of those who seek to buy units in the
cooperative—and notoriously snoopy about their financial affairs and general
reputations.

After all, if one shareholder fails to make payments when
due, the other shareholders have to make up the difference. Originally,
cooperatives

held only a single blanket mortgage on the building held in
the name of the corporation. More recently, banks (at least in New York) have
been

allowed to lend money to individuals secured by their shares
in the corporation. Typically, individuals who acquire units are on the hook
for both

types of financing.

Condominiums are, relatively speaking, a much newer form of
property in the United States. They apparently originated in Spanish law, and

came to the U.S. indirectly via Latin America and then
Puerto Rico. The critical event in leading to their spread in the U.S. was
lobbying by

Puerto Rican interests to extend mortgage insurance offered
by the Federal Housing Administration to condominiums, which happened in 1961.

Henry Hansmann, Condominium and Cooperative housing:
Transactional Efficiency, Tax Subsidies, and Tenure Choice, 20 J. Legal Studies
25,

61–62 (1991). Real estate developers in other states then
lobbied their state legislatures to enact statutes authorizing condominiums in
order to

tap into this new potential market, and soon the condominium
form of ownership spread by statute throughout the country. Condominiums differ

from cooperatives in that individual units—typically
apartments but increasingly also townhouses—are owned within the walls by
individuals in

fee simple (rather than being leased as with a cooperative).
The common areas—including the outer walls, the heating system, the lobby, and
any

shared recreational facilities—are owned by the unit owners
as tenants in common. This

#725

tenancy in common is regulated by a master deed or
declaration which is binding on all unit owners. The master deed or declaration
typically

calls for the creation of a homeowners’ association, which
manages the common facilities and charges assessments to the unit owners to pay
for

the upkeep, operating expenses, and taxes associated with
the common facilities. Unlike cooperatives, which gained a foothold in only a
few

cities and today are found predominantly in New York,
condominiums have been a much more successful innovation and are today found

everywhere in growing numbers.

A third type of common interest community, which we will
call an association subdivision, consists of stand-alone units—typically
single-

family homes—which nevertheless enjoy certain facilities in
common with other stand-alone units. Such association subdivisions can be

organized as condominiums, or they can be created using
servitudes running with the land (see Chapter IX), or may be formed under
special

statutes that authorize the creation of such subdivisions
and set forth the basic outlines of their organization and governance. See Lee
Anne

Fennell, Contracting Communities, 2004 U. Ill. L. Rev. 829,
837–41. Early forms of association subdivisions were private streets, squares,
or

gardens accessible only by surrounding homeowners, who paid
assessments for upkeep of these common facilities (some of these still exist).

(See Tulk v. Moxhay and Neponsit Property Owners’
Association v. Emigrant Bank, Chapter IX.) Today, association subdivisions are
commonly

built around golf courses, lakes, or marinas, but one
increasingly encounters gated residential communities in which streets and
sidewalks are

owned in common (as are other common facilities) and access
is limited by private security guards.

Common interest communities all present special problems in
terms of management and control of the facilities shared in common by the

individual unit holders. In this respect, they can be
instructively contrasted to leasing as a device for managing shared facilities.
In terms of the

governance of common facilities, the lease can be seen as a
kind of dictatorship: The lessor rules as “lord” over these aspects of the
complex. The

lessor is a constrained dictator, of course. The lessor must
exercise her powers in such a way as to keep tenants paying their rent,
convince

tenants to renew their leases, and convince new tenants to
enter into leases when old tenants vacate. Cooperatives, condominiums, and
common-

interest communities, in contrast, represent a kind of
democracy. The unit owners must determine some way to organize themselves
collectively

in order to manage common areas and shared facilities.
Usually this is done through some combination of a basic organizing document
and an

ongoing elected governing body. A number of commentators
have observed that this amounts to a kind of “private government,” complete
with a

constitution, a legislature, executive enforcement action,
and a method for dispute resolution. See, e.g., Robert

#726

C. Ellickson, Cities and Homeowners Associations, 130 U. Pa.
L. Rev. 1519 (1982).

a.THE TRIBULATIONS OF SHARED GOVERNANCE

Any time a group of people takes on responsibility for
governance of common resources, certain tensions and disagreements are likely
to

arise. The following excerpt describes some of the general
difficulties created by collective governance of common facilities in
cooperatives and

condominiums; its analysis is equally applicable to
association subdivisions.

```

* * * A potentially significant source of costs in
      residential cooperatives and condominiums, though one that is not often
      discussed, lies in

the collective decision-making mechanisms that these forms
require.

a)Inefficient Decisions. If the interests of all members of
the cooperative or condominium were identical, the decisions they made

collectively would presumably be efficient. In fact,
however, their interests often diverge substantially. For one thing, members
vary in their

preferences: some will be satisfied with wood-grained vinyl
for the elevator walls, while others will strongly prefer spending what is
necessary to

have real wood; some will want better laundry facilities in
the basement, while those who take their laundry out or have their own machines
will

not. In addition, interests will diverge because the
members’ apartments differ in structure or location: those on the ground floor
may be less

eager than those on the top floor to refurbish the
elevators. As a consequence, there will be substantial room for outcomes that
do not maximize

the aggregate surplus of the occupants. This might occur,
for example, when the preferences of the median member are different from those
of

the mean, or when an unrepresentative coalition achieves
dominance in collective decisions because their opportunity cost of time is low
or

because they are otherwise strategically positioned to
dominate the decision-making process.

In contrast, the landlord of a rental building, in making
decisions that affect the occupants of the building as a group, generally has
an

incentive to select policies that are efficient since that
will maximize the aggregate rents she can charge. Moreover, the landlord, in
contrast to the

owner-occupants of a cooperative or condominium, is
generally free to choose efficient outcomes since she contracts separately with
each

individual occupant, thus depriving them of the special
opportunity that a voting mechanism gives them to act strategically. In short,
market

#727

contracting is likely to be more efficient than voting in
aggregating the preferences of a building’s occupants.

b)Transaction Costs of Decision Making. Quite aside from the
efficiency of the decisions ultimately made, there may be substantial

transaction costs associated with the process of making
collective decisions in a cooperative or condominium, such as the time that the
occupants

devote to meetings and other governance activities. A single
individual acting as landlord can presumably collect information and make

decisions with less expenditure of effort.

Moreover, the costs of collective decision making in a
cooperative or condominium may be high even in comparison with collective

ownership of the same building by a group of nonresident
investors acting through a partnership or corporation. To be sure, the members
of a

cooperative or condominium have some distinct advantages in
decision making that nonresident investor-owners lack. The members commonly

occupy the building for a number of years and devote a
substantial portion of their income to it; consequently, they have both the
incentive and

the opportunity to invest in information about the building.
Moreover, much relevant information about the building is likely to come to the

members without extra effort simply because they live there.
And, because the members all reside in close proximity to each other, meetings
are

easy to arrange. In contrast, owners who are merely
investors and not occupants will generally be located far from the building and
from each

other and, consequently, will be in a less advantageous
position to exercise effective oversight or make collective decisions. Further,
the

investors’ alternative is to delegate decision-making
responsibility to a manager whom they will also have difficulty monitoring and
who, lacking

full ownership, will have interests that diverge from those
of the investors.

On the other hand, investors differ from owner-occupants in
having highly homogeneous interests. As a consequence, rental buildings, even

when owned collectively by a numerous group of investors,
may be spared the high transaction costs of decision making, as well as the

potentially inefficient outcomes, that cooperatives and
condominiums incur as a consequence of conflicts in preferences and interests
among

their members. And these savings may outweigh the economies
that owner-occupants experience in gathering information and communicating

with each other.

c)How Costly Is Collective Decision Making? Although it is
difficult to obtain direct empirical observations on the costs of collective

decisionmaking, substantial anecdotal and case-law evidence
suggests that conflicts among members are, indeed, a serious problem in the

governance of cooperatives and condominiums and that
homogeneity of membership is an important aid to viability. Moreover, the
success or

failure of cooperative enterprise in a variety of industries
other than housing seems strongly correlated with the degree of homogeneity of
interest

among the members. * * *

#728

Even more persuasive evidence that the recent spread of
cooperatives and condominiums is primarily a response to tax incentives * * *

comes from the remarkable paucity of commercial buildings
organized as cooperatives or condominiums. * * *

Twenty years ago, when condominiums were still new, it was
widely thought that they would see their greatest growth in the commercial

sector. Yet this has not occurred. Commercial cooperatives
and condominiums remain a rarity; multiunit commercial buildings are still
almost

universally organized on a rental basis. In New York City,
for example, despite the extensive development of both cooperatives and

condominiums in the residential sector, there was evidently
only one office building organized as a condominium before 1978, and there were

none organized as cooperatives. Since then, the rate of
formation (primarily through conversion) of office cooperatives and
condominiums has

increased; nevertheless, as of December 1984 there were
still only sixty such buildings in New York City in total, divided roughly
equally

between cooperatives and condominiums. And this was true
despite the fact that office cooperatives and condominiums escape New York
City’s

commercial rent tax. * * *

One reasonable overall interpretation of the data might be
as follows: For all but a small fraction of the occupants of multiunit housing,

neither the cooperative nor the condominium form would be
competitive with rental in the absence of a tax subsidy. * * * By the
mid-1950s, the

net tax subsidy to owner-occupancy was sufficiently large to
make cooperative housing less expensive than rental for a substantial segment
of the

population, and this is reflected in the gradually
increasing share of the multiunit housing market represented by cooperatives in
the 1950s and

1960s. Then, in the early 1960s, the condominium form was
made available in the United States, largely fortuitously, though perhaps also
in part

as a response to the stronger demand for owner-occupied
apartments generated by the tax subsidy. It subsequently took nearly a
decade—until

the early 1970s—to accumulate sufficient experience with the
condominium form to make it acceptable to a broad segment of the market. After

that, however, the existing tax subsidy sufficed to induce
condominiums to spread rapidly through the housing market.

If this interpretation is roughly correct, it follows that,
without a tax subsidy, cooperatives and condominiums might compete poorly with

rental in the market for residential apartments and, at
least outside of jurisdictions with rent control, might today have a relatively
insignificant

market share. This means, in turn, that the tax subsidy to
owner-occupied housing may induce substantial inefficiency in the organization
of

apartment buildings and that a significant fraction of the
value of the subsidy may be lost to this inefficiency. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Hansmann views the collective decision-making associated
with common interest communities as an additional cost beyond the costs
associated

with living in rental housing communities. Is this so clear?
Is it possible that what Hansmann regards as inefficiencies and transaction
costs others regard

as a benefit? We all know people who like to join clubs and
associations that do little other than hold meetings, elect new members and
officers, and

sponsor programs. Is it possible that these same sorts of
people—call them “civics”—also prefer to participate in collective
decision-making about

whether there will be real wood or wood-grained vinyl in the
elevators in their building, rather than submit to the will of a dictatorial
landlord on these

matters? If enough civics participate in the housing market,
perhaps this helps explain the popularity of living in common interest
communities.

Providing some support for Hansmann, one type of selling
point encountered in advertisements for used condominium units is “No HOA!”

[homeowners’ association]. This suggests that at least a
significant segment of market for common interest communities agrees with
Hansmann that

collective governance housing is a hassle.

2 .If Hansmann is correct that common interest communities
impose costs—or at least what many consumers regard as costs—above and beyond

rental communities, then this creates a puzzle: Why have
common interest communities proliferated in recent decades? The percentage of
Americans

living in some type of common interest communities doubled
between 1976 and 1999. Michael H. Schill et al., The Condominium Versus
Cooperative

Puzzle: An Empirical Analysis of Housing in New York City,
36 J. Legal Stud. 275 , 279 ( 2007 ). Currently, common interest communities
represent over

60 percent of new home sales. Clearly, the governance costs
associated with this form of living must be outweighed by other benefits. The
question is,

what are those benefits?

3 .Hansmann argues in the excerpted article that the
preference for common interest communities is attributable to tax breaks. He
presents

historical data comparing the tax benefits of investing in a
multiple-unit housing complex (as a lessor) versus owning a unit in a
multi-unit housing

complex (as a condo owner). Until the Tax Reform Act of 1986
, the tax benefits of being an investor (such as accelerated depreciation)
exceeded the tax

benefits of owning (such as the deduction for property taxes
and home mortgage interest payments). After the Reform Act, the benefits of
owning

became relatively greater. He argues that this switch in
relative tax subsidies is roughly coincident with the boom in construction of
common interest

communities, especially condominiums.

4 .Calculating the tax consequences of owning versus renting
is tricky, however. Lessors can deduct taxes and interest payments too (as
business

expenses) and in addition they can deduct depreciation,
something owners cannot do. In a competitive rental market, these tax “savings”
should be

passed on, at least in part, to renters in the form of lower
rents. Also, tax policies are always changing, with the home mortgage interest
deduction

subject to special limits and the partial phase-out of
itemized deductions for

```



730



```

higher-income taxpayers. Perhaps the most decisive objection
to the tax benefit theory comes from the surge in the popularity of association

subdivisions composed of freestanding homes, which are
especially prevalent in the West and Southwest. These include private gated
communities

created by developers in which the streets, sidewalks, other
common areas like parks, and sometimes even the police force are privately
owned and

operated by a private homeowners’ association organized
along the lines of a condominium association. Presumably, persons who purchase
freestanding

homes in a gated community obtain no more tax benefits than
do persons who purchase freestanding homes in an ordinary subdivision.

5 .Another explanation for the surge in popularity of owning
rather than renting is the housing price bubble that started in the late 1980 s
and

accelerated through the 1990 s and 2000 s. Once the bubble
burst, it was clear that many people had unrealistic expectations that housing
prices would

always rise faster than inflation and in particular that
they would always go up not down. (See Chapter VII.) This belief, which was
widespread, no

doubt encouraged many people who otherwise would have
preferred to rent, to buy a condo. It also encouraged many people who already
had a primary

residence to buy a condominium as a second home or an
investment property, in the expectation that the value would keep going up over
time and they

could eventually sell at a profit. Some accounts of the
bursting of the housing bubble and the ensuing flood of foreclosures in 2007 –
08 emphasize that

the problem was especially severe in communities with high
percentages of condominiums.

6 .Is the phenomenon entirely demand-driven, or is it
possible that it is also in part supply-driven? One contention, which relates
primarily to

association subdivisions, is that local governments faced
with budgetary restraints prefer association subdivisions to ordinary
subdivisions because more

local expenditures—for new school buildings, streets, parks,
and even policing—can be off-loaded to developers who agree to pay for these
things as

part of the price of being allowed to develop. Local
officials use their discretion over zoning and over zoning and building permits
to tilt the market for

new construction in favor of exclusionary communities. See
Steven Siegel, The Public Role in Establishing Private Residential Communities,
38 Urb.

Law. 859 ( 2006 ); Hannah Wiseman, Public Communities,
Private Rules, 9 Geo. L.J. 697 ( 2010 ). This of course would explain only the
boom in

association subdivisions, not the rising preference for
condominiums over rental housing in apartment-style complexes.

7 .Can you think of other explanations besides tax benefits,
housing bubbles, or local government budgetary constraints for why persons
might

prefer to own rather than rent the personal living space
they occupy? For example, who is more likely to have discretionary control over
how to remodel

a kitchen or a bathroom in an apartment: a renter or an
owner of a cooperative or condominium unit? Is there any reason to think that
preferences

regarding these sorts of individual control variables may
have changed in recent decades? Could lessors respond to increased demand for
custom

kitchens and Jacuzzis in bathrooms by remodeling apartments
to a tenant’s specifications in return for a long-term lease? Why have we not
seen

```



731

this response by lessors in the marketplace for housing?
Alternatively, are common interest communities a device for loading up on
collective amenities

so as to discriminate indirectly against low-income and
minority residents? Lior J. Strahilevitz, Exclusive Amenities in Residential
Communities, 92 Va.

L. Rev. 437 ( 2007 ).

Condos Versus Coops

Condominiums and cooperatives are alternative legal forms
for accomplishing the same end: Individual ownership of living units combined

with collective governance of common facilities. In the
competition between these forms, the condominium is the clear winner. Coops had
a

significant head start of about 85 years. But once statutes
were adopted in most states authorizing condominiums, and real estate
professionals

became comfortable with the condominium model—roughly the
mid-1970s—condominiums took off and left cooperatives in the dust. New York

City, the only place where significant numbers of
cooperatives remain, confirms the inherent advantages of the condominium form.
Real estate

professionals have long perceived that condominiums command
a higher price than cooperative apartments for otherwise similar units. One

study finds that the typical condominium apartment sells for
8.8 percent more than an equivalent cooperative. Michael H. Schill et al., The

Condominium Versus Cooperative Puzzle: An Empirical Analysis
of Housing in New York, 36 J. Legal Stud. 275, 312 (2007).

Two factors appear to account for the greater appeal of the
condominium. One is financing. Coops were originally financed by a blanket

mortgage on the entire facility, with individual
shareholders responsible for a portion of the debt. Financing was limited to
each shareholder’s

portion of the unpaid balance on the blanket mortgage.
Today, purchasers can obtain separate financing for their unit, secured by
their shares in

the association. But even today the common facilities are
often subject to a mortgage for which all shareholders are responsible. For

condominiums, each unit owner has a fee simple in her
individual unit. The value of the unit includes the owner’s interest as a
tenant in common

in the common facilities. The entire unit value is subject
to financing in the same way as a free-standing home or other real estate is.

Second and more importantly, the fact that all residents
bear a portion of the risk of default by any single shareholder means that

cooperative boards typically impose severe financial
restrictions on who can buy into a coop. Often potential purchasers must
demonstrate that

they have large amounts of unencumbered liquid investment
assets before they are allowed to purchase. This limits the number of potential

purchasers, which makes the market for coops thinner. Coop
boards are also given very broad discretion to investigate the financial
history and

personal affairs of potential purchasers, at least
ostensibly to assure themselves that the prospect is a good credit risk
(although many suspect

#732

that aspirations for exclusiveness also play a role). This
close scrutiny discourages some potential purchasers from trying to buy into a
coop and

shuts out others who try but fail to make the grade. All of
which again drives down the price relative to condominiums, where a requirement
of

board approval for a purchase is less common and when it
exists is typically much less demanding.

b.JUDICIAL REVIEW OF GOVERNANCE DISPUTES

When multi-unit facilities like high-rise apartments or
shopping centers are governed by leases, questions about governance of the
complex

are relatively straightforward: The lessor rules over the
complex like a dictator. The lessor’s dictatorship, as previously noted, is
constrained by

market forces and by the specific promises she makes in
leases with tenants. But subject to these constraints, the lessor can make
decisions about

management of the common areas and shared facilities
unilaterally. She can, for example, decide what color of wallpaper to put in
the lobby,

whether to convert the furnace from heating oil to natural
gas, or whether the occupants of the individual units will be allowed to keep
pets.

As the Hansmann excerpt suggests, when multi-unit facilities
are organized as cooperatives or condominiums, the governance questions are

significantly more problematic. Now, the owners of the
individual units are also, collectively, the body responsible for management of
common

areas and shared facilities. Two principal mechanisms are
used in cooperatives and condominiums to solve ongoing governance problems. The

first is contractual. The articles of incorporation or the
master deed establishing the cooperative or condominium will contain a number
of rules

and regulations that run with the ownership of the
individual interests, and hence can be said to bind any person who acquires an
ownership

interest in one of the individual units. The other is to
establish a board of directors, homeowners’ association, or similar governing
body that is

charged with authority to establish rules and
regulations—and bring enforcement actions—against individual unit owners. The
following cases

explore the role of the courts in overseeing both types of
mechanisms.

Inc.

Supreme Court of California, 1994.



878 P. 2 d 1275.

■
KENNARD, JUSTICE. A homeowner in a 530-unit condominium complex sued to prevent
the homeowners association from enforcing a restriction

against keeping cats, dogs, and other animals in the
condominium development. The owner asserted that the restriction, which was

#733

contained in the project’s declaration^1 recorded by the
condominium project’s developer, was “unreasonable” as applied to her because
she kept

her three cats indoors and because her cats were “noiseless”
and “created no nuisance.” Agreeing with the premise underlying the owner’s

complaint, the Court of Appeal concluded that the homeowners
association could enforce the restriction only upon proof that plaintiff’s cats

would be likely to interfere with the right of other
homeowners “to the peaceful and quiet enjoyment of their property.”

Those of us who have cats or dogs can attest to their
wonderful companionship and affection. But the issue before us is not whether
in the

abstract pets can have a beneficial effect on humans.
Rather, the narrow issue here is whether a pet restriction that is contained in
the recorded

declaration of a condominium complex is enforceable against
the challenge of a homeowner. As we shall explain, the Legislature, in Civil
Code

section 1354, has required that courts enforce the
covenants, conditions and restrictions contained in the recorded declaration of
a common

interest development “unless unreasonable.”^2 * * *

I

Lakeside Village is a large condominium development in
Culver City, Los Angeles County. It consists of 530 units spread throughout 12

separate 3-story buildings. The residents share common
lobbies and hallways, in addition to laundry and trash facilities.

The Lakeside Village project is subject to certain
covenants, conditions and restrictions (hereafter CC & R’s) that were
included in the

developer’s declaration recorded with the Los Angeles County
Recorder on April 17, 1978, at the inception of the development project.

Ownership of a unit includes membership in the project’s
homeowners association, the Lakeside Village Condominium Association (hereafter

Association), the body that enforces the project’s CC &
R’s, including the pet restriction, which provides in relevant part: “No
animals (which

shall mean dogs and cats), livestock, reptiles or poultry
shall be kept in any unit.”^3

#734

In January 1988, plaintiff Natore Nahrstedt purchased a
Lakeside Village condominium and moved in with her three cats. When the

Association learned of the cats’ presence, it demanded their
removal and assessed fines against Nahrstedt for each successive month that she

remained in violation of the condominium project’s pet
restriction.

Nahrstedt then brought this lawsuit against the Association,
its officers, and two of its employees, asking the trial court * * * to declare
the

pet restriction “unreasonable” as applied to indoor cats
(such as hers) that are not allowed free run of the project’s common areas.
Nahrstedt also

alleged she did not know of the pet restriction when she
bought her condominium. * * *

The Association demurred to the complaint. In its supporting
points and authorities, the Association argued that the pet restriction
furthers

the collective “health, happiness and peace of mind” of
persons living in close proximity within the Lakeside Village condominium
development,

and therefore is reasonable as a matter of law. The trial
court sustained the demurrer as to each cause of action and dismissed
Nahrstedt’s

complaint. Nahrstedt appealed.

A divided Court of Appeal reversed the trial court’s
judgment of dismissal. In the majority’s view, the complaint stated a claim for

declaratory relief based on its allegations that Nahrstedt’s
three cats are kept inside her condominium unit and do not bother her
neighbors.

#735

According to the majority, whether a condominium use
restriction is “unreasonable,” as that term is used in section 1354, hinges on
the facts of a

particular homeowner’s case. Thus, the majority reasoned,
Nahrstedt would be entitled to declaratory relief if application of the pet
restriction in

her case would not be reasonable. * * *

On the Association’s petition, we granted review to decide
when a condominium owner can prevent enforcement of a use restriction that the

project’s developer has included in the recorded declaration
of CC & R’s.

II

Today, condominiums, cooperatives, and planned-unit
developments with homeowners associations have become a widely accepted form of

real property ownership. These ownership arrangements are
known as “common interest” developments. The owner not only enjoys many of the

traditional advantages associated with individual ownership
of real property, but also acquires an interest in common with others in the
amenities

and facilities included in the project. It is this hybrid
nature of property rights that largely accounts for the popularity of these new
and innovative

forms of ownership in the 20th century. * * *

Use restrictions are an inherent part of any common interest
development and are crucial to the stable, planned environment of any shared

ownership arrangement. * * * The restrictions on the use of
property in any common interest development may limit activities conducted in
the

common areas as well as in the confines of the home itself.
Commonly, use restrictions preclude alteration of building exteriors, limit the
number

of persons that can occupy each unit, and place limitations
on—or prohibit altogether—the keeping of pets.

Restrictions on property use are not the only characteristic
of common interest ownership. Ordinarily, such ownership also entails

mandatory membership in an owners association, which,
through an elected board of directors, is empowered to enforce any use
restrictions

contained in the project’s declaration or master deed and to
enact new rules governing the use and occupancy of property within the project.

---

In Hidden Harbour Estates v. Basso , 393 So.2d 637 (Fla.
Dist. Ct. App. 1981), the Florida court distinguished two categories of use

restrictions: use restrictions set forth in the declaration
or master deed of the condominium project itself, and rules promulgated by the
governing

board of the condominium owners association or the board’s
interpretation of a rule. (Id. at p. 639 .) The latter category of use
restrictions, the

court said, should be subject to a “reasonableness” test, so
as to “somewhat fetter the discretion of the board of directors.” (Id. at p.
640 .) Such a

standard, the court explained, best assures that governing
boards will “enact rules and make decisions that are reasonably related to the

promotion of the health, happiness and peace of mind” of the
project owners, considered collectively. (Ibid.)

#736

By contrast, restrictions contained in the declaration or
master deed of the condominium complex, the Florida court concluded, should not

be evaluated under a “reasonableness” standard. (Hidden
Harbour Estates v. Basso, supra, 393 So.2d at pp. 639–640.) Rather, such use

restrictions are “clothed with a very strong presumption of
validity” and should be upheld even if they exhibit some degree of
unreasonableness.

(Id. at pp. 6 39, 640.) Nonenforcement would be proper only
if such restrictions were arbitrary or in violation of public policy or some

fundamental constitutional right. (Id. at pp. 639–640.) * *
*

Indeed, giving deference to use restrictions contained in a
condominium project’s originating documents protects the general expectations
of

condominium owners “that restrictions in place at the time
they purchase their units will be enforceable.” (Note, Judicial Review of

Condominium Rulemaking, supra, 94 Harv.L.Rev. 647, 653;
Ellickson, Cities and Homeowners’ Associations, 130 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1519, 1526–

1527 (1982) [stating that association members “unanimously
consent to the provisions in the association’s original documents” and courts

therefore should not scrutinize such documents for
“reasonableness.”].) This in turn encourages the development of shared
ownership housing—

generally a less costly alternative to single-dwelling
ownership—by attracting buyers who prefer a stable, planned environment. It
also protects

buyers who have paid a premium for condominium units in
reliance on a particular restrictive scheme. * * *

III

In California, common interest developments are subject to
the provisions of the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act

(hereafter Davis-Stirling Act or Act). (§ 1350 et seq.) The
Act, passed into law in 1985, consolidated in one part of the Civil Code
certain

definitions and other substantive provisions pertaining to
condominiums and other types of common interest developments. (Stats.1985, ch.
874,

§ 14, p. 2774.) * * *

Pertinent here is the Act’s provision for the enforcement of
use restrictions contained in the project’s recorded declaration. That
provision,

subdivision (a) of section 1354, states in relevant part:
“The covenants and restrictions in the declaration shall be enforceable
equitable

servitudes, unless unreasonable, and shall inure to the
benefit of and bind all owners of separate interests in the development.”
(Italics added.)^9

To determine when a restrictive covenant included in the
declaration of a common interest development cannot be enforced, we must
construe

section 1354. In doing so, our primary task is to ascertain
legislative intent, giving the words of the statute their ordinary meaning.

#737

The words, however, must be read in context, considering the
nature and purpose of the statutory enactment. * * *

As we discussed previously, recorded CC & R’s are the
primary means of achieving the stability and predictability so essential to the

success of a shared ownership housing development. In
general, then, enforcement of a common interest development’s recorded CC &
R’s will

both encourage the development of land and ensure that
promises are kept, thereby fulfilling both of the policies identified by the
Restatement.

(See Rest., Property, § 539, com. f, p. 3230.)

When courts accord a presumption of validity to all such
recorded use restrictions and measure them against deferential standards of

equitable servitude law, it discourages lawsuits by owners
of individual units seeking personal exemptions from the restrictions. This
also

promotes stability and predictability in two ways. It
provides substantial assurance to prospective condominium purchasers that they
may rely

with confidence on the promises embodied in the project’s
recorded CC & R’s. And it protects all owners in the planned development
from

unanticipated increases in association fees to fund the
defense of legal challenges to recorded restrictions. * * *

Contrary to the dissent’s accusations that the majority’s
decision “fray[s]” the “social fabric” (dis.opn., post), we are of the view
that our

social fabric is best preserved if courts uphold and enforce
solemn written instruments that embody the expectations of the parties rather
than

treat them as “worthless paper” as the dissent would
(dis.opn., post). Our social fabric is founded on the stability of expectation
and obligation

that arises from the consistent enforcement of the terms of
deeds, contracts, wills, statutes, and other writings. To allow one person to
escape

obligations under a written instrument upsets the
expectations of all the other parties governed by that instrument (here, the
owners of the other

529 units) that the instrument will be uniformly and
predictably enforced. * * *

Refusing to enforce the CC & R’s contained in a recorded
declaration, or enforcing them only after protracted litigation that would
require

justification of their application on a case-by-case basis,
would impose great strain on the social fabric of the common interest
development. It

would frustrate owners who had purchased their units in
reliance on the CC & R’s. It would put the owners and the homeowners
association in

the difficult and divisive position of deciding whether
particular CC & R’s should be applied to a particular owner. Here, for
example, deciding

whether a particular animal is “confined to an owner’s unit
and create[s] no noise, odor, or nuisance” (dis. opn., post) is a
fact-intensive

determination that can only be made by examining in detail
the behavior of the particular animal and the behavior of the particular owner.

Homeowners associations are ill-equipped to make such
investigations, and any decision they might make in a particular case could be
divisive

or subject to claims of partiality.

#738

Enforcing the CC & R’s contained in a recorded
declaration only after protracted case-by-case litigation would impose
substantial litigation

costs on the owners through their homeowners association,
which would have to defend not only against owners contesting the application
of the

CC & R’s to them, but also against owners contesting any
case-by-case exceptions the homeowners association might make. In short, it is

difficult to imagine what could more disrupt the harmony of
a common interest development than the course proposed by the dissent. * * *

V

Under the holding we adopt today, the reasonableness or
unreasonableness of a condominium use restriction that the Legislature has made

subject to section 1354 is to be determined not by reference
to facts that are specific to the objecting homeowner, but by reference to the
common

interest development as a whole. As we have explained, when,
as here, a restriction is contained in the declaration of the common interest

development and is recorded with the county recorder, the
restriction is presumed to be reasonable and will be enforced uniformly against
all

residents of the common interest development unless the
restriction is arbitrary, imposes burdens on the use of lands it affects that
substantially

outweigh the restriction’s benefits to the development’s
residents, or violates a fundamental public policy.

Accordingly, here Nahrstedt could prevent enforcement of the
Lakeside Village pet restriction by proving that the restriction is arbitrary,

that it is substantially more burdensome than beneficial to
the affected properties, or that it violates a fundamental public policy. * * *
We

conclude, as a matter of law, that the recorded pet
restriction of the Lakeside Village condominium development prohibiting cats or
dogs but

allowing some other pets is not arbitrary, but is rationally
related to health, sanitation and noise concerns legitimately held by residents
of a high-

density condominium project such as Lakeside Village, which
includes 530 units in 12 separate 3-story buildings.

Nahrstedt’s complaint alleges no facts that could possibly
support a finding that the burden of the restriction on the affected property
is so

disproportionate to its benefit that the restriction is
unreasonable and should not be enforced. Also, the complaint’s allegations
center on

Nahrstedt and her cats (that she keeps them inside her
condominium unit and that they do not bother her neighbors), without any
reference to the

effect on the condominium development as a whole, thus
rendering the allegations legally insufficient to overcome section 1354’s
presumption of

the restriction’s validity. * * *

[Reversed and remanded.]

■
ARABIAN, JUSTICE, dissenting.

#739

“There are two means of refuge from the misery of life:
music and cats.”^1

I respectfully dissent. While technical merit may commend
the majority’s analysis, its application to the facts presented reflects a
narrow,

indeed chary, view of the law that eschews the human spirit
in favor of arbitrary efficiency. In my view, the resolution of this case well
illustrates

the conventional wisdom, and fundamental truth, of the
Spanish proverb, “It is better to be a mouse in a cat’s mouth than a man in a
lawyer’s

hands.”

As explained below, I find the provision known as the “pet
restriction” contained in the covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC &
R’s)

governing the Lakeside Village project patently arbitrary
and unreasonable within the meaning of Civil Code section 1354. Beyond dispute,

human beings have long enjoyed an abiding and cherished
association with their household animals. Given the substantial benefits
derived from

pet ownership, the undue burden on the use of property
imposed on condominium owners who can maintain pets within the confines of
their

units without creating a nuisance or disturbing the quiet
enjoyment of others substantially outweighs whatever meager utility the
restriction may

serve in the abstract. It certainly does not promote
“health, happiness [or] peace of mind” commensurate with its tariff on the
quality of life for

those who value the companionship of animals. Worse, it
contributes to the fraying of our social fabric.

* * * [T]he value of pets in daily life is a matter of
      common knowledge and understanding as well as extensive documentation. People
      of all

ages, but particularly the elderly and the young, enjoy
their companionship. Those who suffer from serious disease or injury and are
confined to

their home or bed experience a therapeutic, even spiritual,
benefit from their presence. Animals provide comfort at the death of a family
member

or dear friend, and for the lonely can offer a reason for
living when life seems to have lost its meaning. In recognition of these
benefits, both

Congress and the state Legislature have expressly guaranteed
that elderly and handicapped persons living in public-assistance housing cannot
be

deprived of their pets. ( 12 U.S.C. § 1701r–1; Health &
Saf.Code, § 19901.) Not only have children and animals always been natural
companions,

children learn responsibility and discipline from pet
ownership while developing an important sense of kindness and protection for
animals.

Single adults may find certain pets can afford a feeling of
security. Families benefit from the experience of sharing that having a pet
encourages.

While pet ownership may not be a fundamental right as such,
unquestionably it is an integral aspect of our daily existence, which cannot be

lightly dismissed and should not suffer unwarranted
intrusion into its circle of privacy. * * *

#740

What is gained from an uncompromising prohibition against
pets that are confined to an owner’s unit and create no noise, odor, or

nuisance?

To the extent such animals are not seen, heard, or smelled
any more than if they were not kept in the first place, there is no
corresponding or

concomitant benefit. Pets that remain within the four
corners of their owners’ condominium space can have no deleterious or offensive
effect on

the project’s common areas or any neighboring unit.
Certainly, if other owners and residents are totally unaware of their presence,
prohibiting

pets does not in any respect foster the “health, happiness
[or] peace of mind” of anyone except the homeowners association’s board of
directors,

who are thereby able to promote a form of sophisticated
bigotry. In light of the substantial and disproportionate burden imposed for
those who

must forego virtually any and all association with pets,
this lack of benefit renders a categorical ban unreasonable under Civil Code
section 1354.

---

From the statement of the facts through the conclusion, the
majority’s analysis gives scant acknowledgment to any of the foregoing

considerations but simply takes refuge behind the
“presumption of validity” now accorded all CC & R’s irrespective of subject
matter. They

never objectively scrutinize defendants’ blandishments of
protecting “health and happiness” or realistically assess the substantial
impact on

affected unit owners and their use of their property. * * *

Here, such inquiry should start with an evaluation of the
interest that will suffer upon enforcement of the pet restriction. In
determining the

“burden on the use of land,” due recognition must be given
to the fact that this particular “use” transcends the impersonal and mundane
matters

typically regulated by condominium CC & R’s, such as
whether someone can place a doormat in the hallway or hang a towel on the patio
rail or

have food in the pool area, and reaches the very quality of
life of hundreds of owners and residents. Nonetheless, the majority accept
uncritically

the proffered justification of preserving “health and
happiness” and essentially consider only one criterion to determine
enforceability: was the

restriction recorded in the original declaration? If so, it
is “presumptively valid,” unless in violation of public policy. Given the
application of the

law to the facts alleged and by an inversion of relative
interests, it is difficult to hypothesize any CC & R’s that would not pass
muster. Such

sanctity has not been afforded any writing save the
commandments delivered to Moses on Mount Sinai, and they were set in stone, not
upon

worthless paper.

Moreover, unlike most conduct controlled by CC & R’s,
the activity at issue here is strictly confined to the owner’s interior space;
it does

not in any manner invade other units or the common areas.
Owning a home of one’s own has always epitomized the American dream. More than

simply embodying the notion of having “one’s castle,” it
represents the sense of freedom and self-determination emblematic of our
national

#741

character. Granted, those who live in multi-unit
developments cannot exercise this freedom to the same extent possible on a
large estate. But

owning pets that do not disturb the quiet enjoyment of
others does not reasonably come within this compromise. Nevertheless, with no

demonstrated or discernible benefit, the majority
arbitrarily sacrifice the dream to the tyranny of the “commonality.” * * *

[T]he majority’s failure to consider the real burden imposed
by the pet restriction unfortunately belittles and trivializes the interest at
stake

here. Pet ownership substantially enhances the quality of
life for those who desire it. When others are not only undisturbed by, but
completely

unaware of, the presence of pets being enjoyed by their
neighbors, the balance of benefit and burden is rendered disproportionate and

unreasonable, rebutting any presumption of validity. Their
view, shorn of grace and guiding philosophy, is devoid of the humanity that
must

temper the interpretation and application of all laws, for
in a civilized society that is the source of their authority. As judicial
architects of the

rules of life, we better serve when we construct halls of
harmony rather than walls of wrath.

I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Natore Nahrstedt is said to “own” her condominium unit.
But in what respects, if any, does she have more rights than a lessee would
have under

a lease of such a unit from a lessor (other than the
convenient fact that she is allowed to deduct mortgage interest from her income
for federal income tax

purposes)? She is restricted by all kinds of rules and
regulations, and has lost any power even to say whether she gets to keep some
harmless indoor cats.

Apparently when she signed the deed to the property, she
also signed away a good portion of the rights associated with the “Blackstonian
bundle” of full

ownership, including the right to keep a pet in the unit.
Does this mean that she is an owner in only a qualified sense? Or is this just
a reflection of the

fact that part of what it means to be an owner is to be able
to enter into contracts that waive or disclaim many of the traditional rights
associated with

being an owner?

2 .Is the majority opinion in _Nahrstedt_ faithful to the
controlling language of the statute that prescribes its role in reviewing
covenants, conditions,

and restrictions (CC&Rs)? The statute says such
CC&Rs are to be enforced “unless unreasonable.” The court seems to say that
any restriction in the

master deed is to be given a “presumption of validity” and
upheld unless it produces a completely irrational result for everyone in the
common interest

community. Is the dissent’s analysis, which seeks to show
that the restriction is unreasonable as applied to Natore Nahrstedt, more
faithful to what the

statute says?

3 .Can _Nahrstedt_ ’s announced rule strictly enforcing
CC&Rs in master deeds be reconciled with _Javins_ ’ refusal to enforce
certain provisions in

leases such as the lessor’s disclaimer of any implied
warranty of

habitability? Do prospective owners of condominium units
have more choices in the marketplace than prospective residential lessees do?
If so, why?

Are prospective owners of condominium units more likely to
be represented by counsel than are prospective residential lessees? If so, why?

4 .The California Supreme Court in _Nahrstedt_ also
specifically disapproved of two other California court of appeals decisions
that had invalidated

use restrictions in condominium complexes as unreasonable.
One, _Bernardo Villas Management Corp. v. Black_ , 235 Cal.Rptr. 509 (Cal. Ct.
App. 1987 ),

held that a restriction prohibiting residents from keeping
any “truck, camper, trailer, boat... or other form of recreational vehicle” in
a carport could not

be applied to prevent a unit owner from keeping in the
carport a clean new pickup truck with a camper shell that he used for personal
transportation. The

second, _Portola Hills Community Assn. v. James_ , 5
Cal.Rptr. 2 d 580 (Cal. Ct. App. 1992 ), refused to enforce a planned
community’s restriction banning

satellite dishes against a homeowner who had installed a
satellite dish in his backyard that was not visible to other project residents
or the public. Does

_Nahrstedt_ ’s direction that both of these restrictions
should have been upheld strike you as more problematic (in one case or in both)
than upholding the

restriction on pets at issue in _Nahrstedt_?

5 .Some law-and-economics oriented scholars, including
Robert Ellickson in the article cited by the California Supreme Court, have
argued that

use restrictions contained in the master deed of a complex
are presumptively efficient because the developer of the project (who writes
the restrictions in

the master deed) will have an incentive to include only
those restrictions that cause the purchase price of units to go up. Thus, the
developer of the

Lakeside Village complex presumably included the restriction
on pets because he or she concluded that prospective purchasers would be
willing to pay

more for units in a complex in which pets are prohibited.
Or, perhaps more realistically, developers surmise that potential purchasers
will separate into

(at least) two groups—those who want to live in a
pet-friendly complex and those who prefer a pet-free complex. Developers will
accordingly either

restrict all pets or permit pets, one way or another, in new
projects depending on their perceptions of which way the market is tilting at
any given point

in time. This process will continue so that, at any given
moment, the condominium market is roughly in equilibrium with approximately the
right

balance of pet-friendly and pet-free options for prospective
purchasers. Theoretical commentary on these issues is divided. Some authors
express

optimism about the ability of purchasers to get what they
want. See, e.g., Ellickson, supra, 130 U. Pa. L. Rev. at 1543 – 44 ; Clayton P.
Gillette, Mediating

Institutions: Beyond the Public/Private Distinction: Courts,
Covenants, and Communities, 61 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1375 , 1363 ( 1994 ). Others are
skeptical of

the market’s ability to deliver a large enough range of
options or to protect democratic values. See, e.g., Fennell, Contracting
Communities, supra;

Gerald E. Frug, Cities and Homeowners Associations: A Reply,
130 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1589 , 1592 – 96 ( 1982 ). Empirical evidence on the value
of pet

restrictions is mixed: An older study suggests that allowing
only cats increases, whereas allowing dogs decreases, condo value. Roger E.
Cannaday,

Condominium Covenants: Cats, Yes; Dogs, No,

```



743



```

35 J. Urb. Econ. 71 ( 1994 ). But a recent larger study
suggests that condo complexes with no restrictions on pets enjoy a price
premium over complexes

with restrictions. Zhenguo Lin, Marcus T. Allen, &
Charles C. Carter, Pet Policy and Housing Prices: Evidence from the Condominium
Market, 47 J.

Real Estate Fin. & Econ. 109 ( 2013 ).

6 .For an interesting empirical study suggesting that
developers are sensitive to the potential for later political conflict, see
Yoram Barzel & Tim R.

Sass, The Allocation of Resources by Voting, 105 Q.J. Econ.
745 ( 1990 ). Voting rules in common-interest communities tend to track
economic stakes

(i.e., by unit, floor area, or by value, and not one person
one vote), and the authors argue that this is a market-driven efficient result.
Barzel and Sass find

that with increases in group heterogeneity and higher
potential for wealth transfers, decision rules require larger supermajorities.
Barzel and Sass argue

that harmony is easier to achieve where pecuniary benefits
are at stake, rather than direct consumption benefits. They also find that
decisions over

amenities that will have different impacts to different
units tend to be constructed upfront rather than made subject to later
decisions by the association.

7 .There is a growing segment of the housing market for
common-interest communities that emphasizes the development of close-knit
community.

Examples include facets of the Sharing Economy, sometimes
made possible through new technology. A longstanding movement gaining new
attention is

co-housing, in which privately owned units (apartments or
houses) are grouped around common facilities (such as for dining and child
care), and

participatory democracy is emphasized. Co-housing
communities vary in terms of how easily individuals can opt out of community
activities. See, e.g.,

Mark Fenster, Community by Covenant, Process, and Design:
Cohousing and the Contemporary Common Interest Community, 15 J. Land Use &
Envtl.

L. 3 ( 1999 ). Should courts give greater or lesser
deference to rules produced by co-housing communities than those of the typical
homeowners’

association? See Carrie Griffin Basas, _Olmstead_ ’s Promise
and Cohousing’s Potential, 26 Ga. St. U. L. Rev. 663 , 672 – 78 ( 2010 )
(examining cohousing

with a focus on its potential for the disabled or elderly);
France Svistovski, Burning Down the Housing Market: Communal Living in New
York, 47

Fordham Urb. L.J. 463 ( 2020 ) (exploring impact of legal
landscape in New York City on a variety of communal living arrangements).

8 .Six years after _Nahrstedt_ was decided, the California
legislature enacted a statute making it unlawful for a common-interest
development like

Lakeside Village to prohibit unit owners from keeping at
least one pet. California Civil Code § 1360. 5 (Supp. 2001 , enacted 2000 ).
Apparently pet

lovers in California have more clout with the legislature
than those who wish to live in a pet-free community. Does this strike you as an
appropriate

subject for legislative override of covenants, conditions,
and restrictions in common-interest communities? How does this affect the
living options of

persons who have severe allergies to cats?

9 .Recently a number of states have passed laws in response
to complaints that homeowners’ associations were enforcing aesthetic
restrictions to

prevent the flying of the American flag. For example,
Illinois’s

```



744



```

recently enacted statute provides: “Notwithstanding any
provision in the association’s declaration, covenants, bylaws, rules,
regulations, or other

instruments... a homeowners’ association... may not prohibit
the outdoor display of the American flag or a military flag, or both, by a
homeowner on

that homeowner’s property if the American flag is displayed
in a manner consistent with... Title 4 of the United States Code.” Act of Aug.
8 , 2003 , 805

Ill. Comp. Stat. 105 / 103. 30 (a). The law allows
associations to adopt “reasonable rules and regulations” regarding the display
of these flags. Id. Does this

legislation vindicate the freedom of the homeowner? Does it
trench on the freedom of homeowners’ associations? Does it promote a collective
interest?

Or is it impermissible viewpoint discrimination, as argued
in Recent Legislation, 117 Harv. L. Rev. 2047 ( 2004 )? Should homeowners’
associations be

able to ban all lawn signs, including those endorsing
candidates or political positions? Should homeowners’ rights to express
themselves be inalienable?

How would these situations be resolved under the test
adopted in _Nahrstedt_?

```

■
ROSENBLATT, J. In Matter of Levandusky v. One Fifth Ave. Apt. Corp., 553 N.E.2d
1317 [N.Y. 1990], we held that the business judgment rule is

the proper standard of judicial review when evaluating
decisions made by residential cooperative corporations. In the case before us,
defendant is

a shareholder-tenant in the plaintiff cooperative building.
The relationship between defendant and the cooperative, including the
conditions under

which a shareholder’s tenancy may be terminated, is governed
by the shareholder’s lease agreement. The cooperative terminated defendant’s

tenancy in accordance with a provision in the lease that
authorized it to do so based on a tenant’s “objectionable” conduct.

Defendant has challenged the cooperative’s action and
asserts, in essence, that his tenancy may not be terminated by the court based
on a

review of the facts under the standard articulated in
Levandusky. He argues that termination may rest only upon a court’s independent
evaluation

of the reasonableness of the cooperative’s action. We
disagree. In reviewing the cooperative’s actions, the business judgment
standard governs a

cooperative’s decision to terminate a tenancy in accordance
with the terms of the parties’ agreement.

I.

Plaintiff cooperative owns the building located at 40 West
67th Street in Manhattan, which contains 38 apartments. In 1998, defendant

bought into the cooperative and acquired 80 shares of stock
appurtenant to his proprietary lease for apartment 7B.

#745

Figure 6-7

40 West 67th Street, New York City

Soon after moving in, defendant engaged in a course of
behavior that, in the view of the cooperative, began as demanding, grew

increasingly disruptive and ultimately became intolerable.
After several points of friction between defendant and the cooperative,^1
defendant

started complaining about his elderly upstairs neighbors, a
retired college professor and his wife who had occupied apartment 8B for over
two

decades. In a stream of vituperative letters to the
cooperative—16 letters in the month of October 1999 alone—he accused the couple
of playing

their television set and stereo at high volumes late into
the night, and claimed they were running a loud and illegal bookbinding
business in their

apartment. Defendant further charged that the couple stored
toxic chemicals in their apartment for use in their “dangerous and illegal”
business.

Upon investigation, the cooperative’s Board determined that
the couple did not possess a television set or stereo and that there was no

#746

evidence of a bookbinding business or any other commercial
enterprise in their apartment.

Hostilities escalated, resulting in a physical altercation
between defendant and the retired professor.^2 Following the altercation,
defendant

distributed flyers to the cooperative residents in which he
referred to the professor, by name, as a potential “psychopath in our midst”
and

accused him of cutting defendant’s telephone lines. In
another flyer, defendant described the professor’s wife and the wife of the
Board president

as having close “intimate personal relations.” Defendant
also claimed that the previous occupants of his apartment revealed that the
upstairs

couple have “historically made excessive noise.” The former
occupants, however, submitted an affidavit that denied making any complaints

about noise from the upstairs apartment and proclaimed that
defendant’s assertions to the contrary were “completely false.”

Furthermore, defendant made alterations to his apartment
without Board approval, had construction work performed on the weekend in

violation of house rules, and would not respond to Board
requests to correct these conditions or to allow a mutual inspection of his
apartment and

the upstairs apartment belonging to the elderly couple.
Finally, defendant commenced four lawsuits against the upstairs couple, the
president of

the cooperative and the cooperative management, and tried to
commence three more.

In reaction to defendant’s behavior, the cooperative called
a special meeting pursuant to article III (First) (f) of the lease agreement,
which

provides for termination of the tenancy if the cooperative
by a two-thirds vote determines that “because of objectionable conduct on the
part of

the Lessee * * * the tenancy of the Lessee is undesirable.”
The cooperative informed the share-holders that the purpose of the meeting was
to

determine whether defendant “engaged in repeated actions
inimical to cooperative living and objectionable to the Corporation and its

stockholders that make his continued tenancy undesirable.”

Timely notice of the meeting was sent to all shareholders in
the cooperative, including defendant. At the ensuing meeting, held in June

2000, owners of more than 75% of the outstanding shares in
the cooperative were present. Defendant chose not attend. By a vote of 2,048
shares

to 0 , the share-holders in attendance passed a resolution
declaring defendant’s conduct “objectionable” and directing the Board to
terminate his

proprietary lease and cancel his shares. The resolution
contained the findings upon which the shareholders concluded that defendant’s
behavior

was inimical to cooperative living. Pursuant to the
resolution, the Board sent defendant a notice of termination requiring him to
vacate his

apartment by August 31, 2000. Ignoring the notice, defendant
remained in the apartment, prompting the cooperative to bring this suit

#747

for possession and ejectment, a declaratory judgment
cancelling defendant’s stock, and a money judgment for use and occupancy, along
with

attorneys’ fees and costs.

The Supreme Court * * * declined to apply the business
judgment rule to sustain the shareholders’ vote and the Board’s issuance of the

notice of termination. Instead, the court invoked RPAPL 71
1(1) and held that to terminate a tenancy, a cooperative must prove its claim
of

objectionable conduct by competent evidence to the
satisfaction of the court.

Disagreeing with Supreme Court, a divided Appellate Division

* * * held that Levandusky prohibited judicial scrutiny of actions of

cooperative boards “taken in good faith and in the exercise
of honest judgment in the lawful and legitimate furtherance of corporate
purposes”

* * * We agree with the Appellate Division majority that the
      business judgment rule applies and therefore affirm.

II.The Levandusky Business Judgment Rule

The heart of this dispute is the parties’ disagreement over
the proper standard of review to be applied when a cooperative exercises its

agreed-upon right to terminate a tenancy based on a
shareholder-tenant’s objectionable conduct. In the agreement establishing the
rights and

duties of the parties, the cooperative reserved to itself
the authority to determine whether a member’s conduct was objectionable and to
terminate

the tenancy on that basis. The cooperative argues that its
decision to do so should be reviewed in accordance with Levandusky’s business

judgment rule. Defendant contends that the business judgment
rule has no application under these circumstances and that RPAPL 711 requires a

court to make its own evaluation of the Board’s conduct
based on a judicial standard of reasonableness.

Levandusky established a standard of review analogous to the
corporate business judgment rule for a shareholder-tenant challenge to a

decision of a residential cooperative corporation. The
business judgment rule is a common-law doctrine by which courts exercise
restraint and

defer to good faith decisions made by boards of directors in
business settings * * * The rule has been long recognized in New York (see
e.g.,

Flynn v. Brooklyn City R.R. Co., 53 N.E. 520 [N.Y. 1899];
Pollitz v. Wabash R.R. Co., 100 N.E. 721 [N.Y. 1912]). In Levandusky, the

cooperative board issued a stop work order for a
shareholder-tenant’s renovations that violated the proprietary lease. The
shareholder-tenant

brought a * * * proceeding to set aside the stop work order.
The Court upheld the Board’s action, and concluded that the business judgment
rule

“best balances the individual and collective interests at
stake” in the residential cooperative setting (Levandusky, 553 N.E.2d 1317).

In the context of cooperative dwellings, the business
judgment rule provides that a court should defer to a cooperative board’s
determination

“[s]o long as the board acts for the purposes of the
cooperative, within the

#748

scope of its authority and in good faith” ( 553 N.E.2d
1317). In adopting this rule, we recognized that a cooperative board’s broad
powers could

lead to abuse through arbitrary or malicious
decision-making, unlawful discrimination or the like. However, we also aimed to
avoid impairing

“the purposes for which the residential community and its
governing structure were formed: protection of the interest of the entire
community of

residents in an environment managed by the board for the
common benefit” ( 553 N.E.2d 1317). The Court concluded that the business
judgment

rule best balances these competing interests and also noted
that the limited judicial review afforded by the rule protects the
cooperative’s

decisions against “undue court involvement and judicial
second-guessing” (553 N.E.2d at 1323).

Although we applied the business judgment rule in
Levandusky, we did not attempt to fix its boundaries, recognizing that this
corporate

concept may not necessarily comport with every situation
encountered by a cooperative and its shareholder-tenants. Defendant argues that
when

it comes to terminations, the business judgment rule
conflicts with RPAPL 71 1(1) and is therefore inoperative.^5 We see no such
conflict. In the

realm of cooperative governance and in the lease provision
before us, the cooperative’s determination as to the tenant’s objectionable
behavior

stands as competent evidence necessary to sustain the
cooperative’s determination. If that were not so, the contract provision for
termination of

the lease—to which defendant agreed—would be meaningless.

We reject the cooperative’s argument that RPAPL 71 1(1) is
irrelevant to these proceedings, but conclude that the business judgment rule

may be applied consistently with the statute. Procedurally,
the business judgment standard will be applied across the cases, but the manner
in

which it presents itself varies with the form of the
lawsuit. Levandusky, for example, was framed as a CPLR article 78 proceeding,
but we applied

the business judgment rule as a concurrent form of
“rationality” and “reasonableness” to determine whether the decision was
“arbitrary and

capricious” pursuant to CPLR 7803(3) (553 N.E.2d at 1323
n.).

Similarly, the procedural vehicle driving this case is RPAPL
71 1(1), which requires “competent evidence” to show that a tenant is

objectionable. Thus, in this context, the competent evidence
that is the basis for the shareholder vote will be reviewed under the business

judgment rule, which means courts will normally defer to
that vote and the shareholders’ stated findings as competent evidence that the
tenant is

indeed objectionable under the statute. As we stated in
Levandusky, a single standard of review for cooperatives is preferable, and “we
see no

#749

purpose in allowing the form of the action to dictate the
substance of the standard by which the legitimacy of corporate action is to be
measured”

(553 N.E.2d 1317).

In addition, RPAPL 711 was derived from former Civil
Practice Act § 1410(6), which was enacted in 1920.... Before that, a landlord
could

evict a tenant based on the landlord’s sole and unfettered
determination that the tenant was objectionable (see e.g. Manhattan Life Ins.
Co. v.

Gosford, 23 N.Y.S. 7 [N.Y. 1893]; Waitt Constr. Co. v.
Loraine, 179 N.Y.S. 167 [N.Y. 1919]). By enacting former Civil Practice Act §
1410(6),

the Legislature imposed on the landlord the burden of
proving that the tenant was objectionable. While RPAPL 71 1(1) applies to the
termination

before us, we are satisfied that the relationships among
shareholders in cooperatives are sufficiently distinct from traditional
landlord-tenant

relationships that the statute’s “competent evidence”
standard is satisfied by the application of the business judgment rule.

Despite this deferential standard, there are instances when
courts should undertake review of board decisions. To trigger further judicial

scrutiny, an aggrieved shareholder-tenant must make a
showing that the board acted (1) outside the scope of its authority, (2) in a
way that did not

legitimately further the corporate purpose or (3) in bad
faith.

III.

A.The Cooperative’s Scope of Authority

Pursuant to its bylaws, the cooperative was authorized
(through its Board) to adopt a form of proprietary lease to be used for all

shareholder-tenants. Based on this authorization, defendant
and other members of the cooperative voluntarily entered into lease agreements

containing the termination provision before us. The
cooperative does not contend that it has the power to terminate the lease
absent the

termination provision. * * *

The cooperative unfailingly followed the procedures
contained in the lease when acting to terminate defendant’s tenancy. In
accordance

with the bylaws, the Board called a special meeting, and
notified all shareholder-tenants of its time, place and purpose. Defendant thus
had notice

and the opportunity to be heard. In accordance with the
agreement, the cooperative acted on a super-majority vote after properly
fashioning the

issue and the question to be addressed by resolution. The
resolution specified the basis for the action, setting forth a list of specific
findings as to

defendant’s objectionable behavior. By not appearing or
presenting evidence personally or by counsel, defendant failed to challenge the
findings

and has not otherwise satisfied us that the Board has in any
way acted ultra vires. In all, defendant has failed to demonstrate that the
cooperative

acted outside the scope of its authority in terminating the
tenancy.

#750

B.Furthering the Corporate Purpose

Levandusky also recognizes that the business judgment rule
prohibits judicial inquiry into Board actions that, presupposing good faith,
are

taken in legitimate furtherance of corporate purposes.
Specifically, there must be a legitimate relationship between the Board’s
action and the

welfare of the cooperative. Here, by the unanimous vote of
everyone present at the meeting, the cooperative resoundingly expressed its
collective

will, directing the Board to terminate defendant’s tenancy
after finding that his behavior was more than its shareholders could bear. The
Board

was under a fiduciary duty to further the collective
interests of the cooperative. By terminating the tenancy, the Board’s action
thus bore an

obvious and legitimate relation to the cooperative’s avowed
ends.

There is, however, an additional dimension to corporate
purpose that Levandusky contemplates, notably, the legitimacy of purpose—a

feature closely related to good faith. Put differently, all
the shareholders of a cooperative may agree on an objective, and the Board may
pursue

that objective zealously, but that does not necessarily mean
the objective is lawful or legitimate. Defendant, however, has not shown that
the

Board’s purpose was anything other than furthering the
overall welfare of a cooperative that found it could no longer abide
defendant’s behavior.

C.Good Faith, in the Exercise of Honest Judgment

Finally, defendant has not shown the slightest indication of
any bad faith, arbitrariness, favoritism, discrimination or malice on the

cooperative’s part, and the record reveals none. Though
defendant contends that he raised sufficient facts in this regard, we agree
with the

Appellate Division majority that defendant has provided no
factual support for his conclusory assertions that he was evicted based upon
illegal or

impermissible considerations. Moreover, as the Appellate
Division noted, the cooperative emphasized that upon the sale of the apartment
it “will

‘turn over [to the defendant] all proceeds after deduction
of unpaid use and occupancy, costs of sale and litigation expenses incurred in
this

dispute’ ” (742 N.Y.S.2d 264). Defendant does not contend
otherwise.

Levandusky cautions that the broad powers of cooperative
governance carry the potential for abuse when a board singles out a person for

harmful treatment or engages in unlawful discrimination,
vendetta, arbitrary decisionmaking or favoritism. We reaffirm that admonition
and

stress that those types of abuses are incompatible with good
faith and the exercise of honest judgment. While deferential, the Levandusky

standard should not serve as a rubber stamp for cooperative
board actions, particularly those involving tenancy terminations. We note that
since

Levandusky was decided, the lower courts have in most
instances deferred to the business judgment of cooperative boards but in a
number of

cases have withheld deference in the face of evidence that
the board acted illegitimately.

#751

The very concept of cooperative living entails a voluntary,
shared control over rules, maintenance and the composition of the community.

Indeed, as we observed in Levandusky, a shareholder-tenant
voluntarily agrees to submit to the authority of a cooperative board, and

consequently the board “may significantly restrict the
bundle of rights a property owner normally enjoys” ( 553 N.E.2d 1317). When
dealing,

however, with termination, courts must exercise a heightened
vigilance in examining whether the board’s action meets the Levandusky test.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Housing cooperatives are an unusual legal animal. The
building is owned by an entity (usually a corporation), in which the residents
own shares.

The corporation then grants a lease in a particular unit to
each resident, associated with the particular shares each owns. Since the
cooperative is part-

corporation, part-lease, you can see how the debate gets
framed in _Pullman_ over the standard of review of the shareholders’ decision
to expel Pullman.

The corporation argues that the decision should be reviewed
under the deferential business judgment rule that applies in shareholder suits
against

directors of corporations. Pullman argues that the review
should be governed by the New York statute that applies to evictions of
objectionable tenants

under lease law.

2 .Given that residents in cooperatives are technically
lessees, why isn’t the standard that the New York legislature has prescribed
for eviction of

objectionable lessees fully applicable? Surely it cannot be
the case that residents of cooperatives have a lesser interest in protecting
their right to

continue living in their home than do residents in rental
apartments. Are commercial landlords more likely to act abusively or to seek to
evict tenants for

pretextual reasons? Under what circumstances might a
commercial landlord have an incentive to try to terminate a lease before the
end of the lease

term? Does the fact that residents in a cooperative vote
democratically provide additional protection against abusive eviction
decisions? Or does the

possibility of mob prejudice make democratic voting a more
feeble form of protection than the commercial self-interest of landlords?

3 .Cooperatives and condominiums, like commercial
apartments, are subject to the Fair Housing Act and other antidiscrimination
laws considered

in Chapter IV. See Broome v. Biondi, 17 F. Supp. 2 d 211
(S.D.N.Y. 1997 ) (awarding $ 640 , 000 judgment against cooperative apartment
for turning down

an application by a mixed race couple); Fletcher v. Dakota,
Inc., 948 N.Y.S. 2 d 263 , 268 (App. Div. 2012 ) (holding that business
judgment rule does not

shield coop board against claim of intentional
discrimination). But given that cooperative housing is subject to one blanket
mortgage for which all

residents are responsible, coops have traditionally managed
to be very picky about who they agree to accept as shareholders, as long as
they steer clear

of violating the civil rights laws. This pickiness has
carried over to rejecting many applications from famous or otherwise notorious

■
MALONE, J.: In 2004, Four Colonies Homes Association (Four Colonies) submitted
a bylaw amendment to its members for approval, which

placed renting restrictions on lot owners in Four Colonies’
subdivision. Fifty-one percent of the lot owners present at the meeting voted
in favor

of the bylaw amendment. When Four Colonies attempted to
enforce the bylaw against James A. Kiekel and Margaret G. Kiekel, the Kiekels
filed

a petition for declaratory judgment with the district court,
asking the court to declare the bylaw unenforceable. Four Colonies filed a

counterclaim for injunctive relief, requesting the court to
enjoin the Kiekels from renting their properties. * * *

Factual and procedural background

Four Colonies is a Kansas not-for-profit corporation
comprised of the property lot owners in the Four Colonies subdivision in
Lenexa,

Kansas. The subdivision was created in 1971 as a
“condominium-type ‘planned unit development’ ” in which individual lot owners
were subject

to property use restrictions pursuant to Four Colonies’
Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (Declaration).

The Declaration, as well as Four Colonies’ Bylaws (Bylaws),
were filed in the Johnson County Register of Deeds office. The Declaration

includes a provision that allows it to be amended by an
instrument signed by not less than 75% of the lot owners. As of 2005, the
Declaration had

never been formally amended pursuant to this provision. The
Bylaws can be amended by a majority vote of lot owners at a meeting.

In 199 7, Four Colonies proposed an amendment to the Bylaws
that would have prevented owners from renting their property until the

number of rental units in the subdivision was reduced to 10%
of the lots, or 69 units. However, Four Colonies cancelled the vote on the

amendment because it subsequently determined that the
proposed bylaw was in conflict with the Declaration.

In October 2004, Four Colonies proposed another bylaw
amendment that would impose various limitations on lot owners’ rights to rent

their property, including:

#753

(1) a prohibition against a currently rented property being
rented after any change in ownership of that property following the adoption

of the By-Laws amendment; (2) a prohibition against any
property not rented as of the adoption of the By-Laws amendment from

being thereafter rented; (3) a requirement that all lease
agreements be submitted to the Association’s Board for approval every twelve

months; (4) a grant of authority to the Association to
terminate any lease and evict any tenant in the event a property owner fails to

comply with the requirements set forth in the By-Laws
amendment; and (5) a provision that the Association be entitled to recover all

costs and attorney fees in terminating any lease and
evicting any tenant pursuant to the terms set forth in the By-Laws amendment.

A special meeting was called to allow owners to vote on the
bylaw amendment. Only 372 of the 681 lot owners (55%) attended the meeting.

At the meeting, the bylaw amendment was approved with 191
(51.34%) lot owners voting in favor of the amendment and 181 (48.66%) voting

against the amendment.

The Four Colonies subdivision consists of 681 property lots,
including 37 duplexes, 1 tri-plex, 54 four-plexes, 1 five-plex, 23 six-plexes,
74

garden villas, and 171 free-standing homes. As of 2005,
approximately 100 to 115 of the lots were being rented by their owners. Four
Colonies

proposed the 2004 bylaw amendment after receiving numerous
complaints from lot owners about the conduct and behavior of tenants who rented

property in the subdivision.

Many of these complaints were about tenants leasing from the
Kiekels. Since 1988, the Kiekels have owned property lots in the subdivision

but have never lived in the subdivision. As of 2005, the
Kiekels, through revocable trusts, owned eight property lots in the
subdivision, which

they rented. Since 1999 , the police have responded to the
Kiekels’ rental properties 15 times. Additionally, Four Colonies claimed it
received 19

complaints about the Kiekels’ tenants, “including parking,
failing to clean up dog feces, loud and disruptive late-night parties and
personal

property stored or left in yards.” According to Four
Colonies, the Kiekels also failed to adequately maintain and repair their
rental properties.

After the 2004 bylaw amendment was approved, the Kiekels
received a letter from Four Colonies asking them to provide information to

Four Colonies about their tenants pursuant to the bylaw. In
response, the Kiekels filed a petition for declaratory judgment with the
Johnson

County District Court. In their petition, the Kiekels argued
the 2004 bylaw amendment was void because it conflicted with the Declaration. *

Four Colonies filed a counterclaim asking the district court
to enjoin the Kiekels from renting their properties and to order them to sell
their

#754

lots to owners who would occupy the residences. Four
Colonies argued that injunctive relief was appropriate because the Kiekels were
violating

the Declaration’s provisions that prohibited noxious
activity and the commercial use of subdivision property.

In June 2005, a bench trial was held. * * * The district
court denied the Kiekels’ claim for declaratory relief. The district court
found that the

2004 bylaw amendment was not in conflict with the
Declaration and that the amendment was reasonable and enforceable. The district
court also

found that the Declaration authorized the board to restrict
the [owners’] rental rights through a bylaw amendment. However, the district
court

also denied Four Colonies’ counterclaim for injunctive
relief based upon the evidence presented at the hearing.

The Kiekels timely appeal the district court’s denial of
their petition for declaratory judgment. Additionally, Four Colonies timely
cross-

appeals the district court’s denial of its claim for
injunctive relief.

Petition for declaratory judgment

* * * The district court framed the issue in this case as
      whether the 2004 bylaw amendment conflicted with the Declaration. The district

court determined that because the bylaw amendment did not
eliminate the Kiekels’ right to rent their property, the bylaw amendment did
not

conflict with the Declaration. However, a more accurate
statement of the issue is whether Four Colonies could impose a post-purchase
property

use restriction on lot owners through an amendment to the
Bylaws. * * *

To resolve the issue at hand, this court must interpret Four
Colonies’ Declaration and Bylaws. The interpretation and legal effect of
written

instruments are matters of law, and an appellate court
exercises unlimited review. McGinley v. Bank of America, N.A., 109 P.3d 1146
(Kan.

2005).

Another well-settled rule is that covenants and agreements
restricting the free use of property are strictly construed against limitations

upon such use. Such restrictions will not be aided or
extended by implication or enlarged by construction. Doubt will be resolved in

favor of the unrestricted use of property. [Citation
omitted.]

Sporn v. Overholt, 262 P.2d 828, 830 (Kan. 1953).

Examining Four Colonies’ Declaration and Bylaws, it appears
the intent was that the Declaration would set forth owners’ fundamental

ownership rights and the Bylaws would set forth enforcement
and govern its procedures. This conclusion is supported by the amendment

procedures included in both documents. An amendment to the
Declaration requires a super-majority vote of 75% of all lot owners; whereas,
an

amendment to the Bylaws requires a simple-majority vote of
lot owners present at a meeting. Because the Declaration defines property
rights,

and the Bylaws do not, it is logical that amending the
Declaration would be more difficult. See 4 Thompson on Real Property

#755

§ 36.06(a), pp. 240–41 (2d ed. 2004) (Absent “an amendment
to the declaration, the enjoyment and use of the real property cannot be
impaired or

diminished.”).

In this case, the original Declaration for the subdivision
includes various restrictive covenants that impose property use restrictions on

owners. These restrictions include, but are not limited to,
restricting owners from using their property for commercial purposes,
restricting

owners from installing awnings without approval, restricting
owners from erecting fences without approval, and restricting owners from
having

more than two household pets. Despite these restrictions,
the Declaration neither expressly prohibits nor expressly permits lot owners to
rent their

property. The Declaration does, however, include three
distinct references to lot owners’ tenants. In one specific instance, the
Declaration defines

“resident” to include not only the owners of lots “but also
the lessees and tenants of such owners.” Strictly construing the Declaration,
it does not

place any restrictions on owners’ rights to rent their
property. See Sporn, 262 P. 2d at 830–31.

This conclusion is borne out by the conduct of the parties
in this case. Lot owners in Four Colonies have been renting their properties
since

the association was created in 1971. As of 2005,
approximately 100 to 115 of the lots were being rented by their owners. In
1997, Four Colonies

proposed an amendment to the Bylaws that would have
temporarily prevented lot owners from renting their properties, but Four
Colonies

withdrew the amendment because it subsequently determined
that the proposed bylaw was in conflict with the Declaration.

We disagree with the district court’s conclusion that the
bylaw amendment did not conflict with the Declaration. The bylaw amendment

essentially eliminated the right to rent property in the
Four Colonies subdivision, except it contained a grandfather provision for lots
that were

currently being rented. More significantly, the bylaw
amendment required all lease agreements to be submitted to the board of
directors for

approval every 12 months. The amendment further granted the
board the authority to terminate any lease and evict the tenant in the event
the lot

owner failed to comply with the requirements set forth in
the Bylaws. The bylaw amendment contained extensive property use restrictions

concerning the rental of property in the Four Colonies
subdivision which only could be accomplished through an amendment to the
Declaration.

---

We conclude the district court erred in finding that Four
Colonies could impose rental restrictions through an amendment to the Bylaws.

The Declaration could have authorized Four Colonies to
restrict the owners’ rental rights had more specific language been utilized. In
this case,

however, it is clear that the Declaration intended any
property use restrictions, including restrictions on renting, to be achieved
through an

amendment to the Declaration. Because Four Colonies failed
to properly amend the Declaration, the bylaw amendment imposing rental

#756

restrictions is void and unenforceable. Based on this
determination, it is unnecessary to address the other issues the Kiekels have
raised on

appeal.

We sympathize with Four Colonies’ desire to eliminate
complaints about rental properties and to maintain an attractive neighborhood.
It

may be true that restricting rental rights would enhance the
property values of all lots in the Four Colonies subdivision. However, to
impose

restrictions on owners’ rights to rent their properties,
Four Colonies must do so through an amendment to the Declaration. We conclude
the

district court erred by denying the Kiekels’ petition for
declaratory judgment.

Request for injunctive relief

In its cross-appeal, Four Colonies claims the district court
erred in denying its counterclaim for injunctive relief. Four Colonies’ request
to

enjoin the Kiekels from renting their property was based
upon the language of the original Declaration. On appeal, Four Colonies argues
the

district court erred (1) in finding that the Kiekels’
renting did not violate the Declaration’s commercial use restriction and (2) in
finding that the

Kiekels’ renting did not violate the Declaration’s noxious
activity restriction.

To obtain injunctive relief, the movant must show:

(1) there is a reasonable probability of irreparable future
injury to the movant; (2) an action at law will not provide an adequate

remedy; (3) the threatened injury to the movant outweighs
whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party;

and (4) the injunction, if issued, would not be adverse to
the public interest.

Empire Mfg. Co. v. Empire Candle, Inc., 41 P.3d 798, 808
(Kan. 2002).

However, under the first factor, a movant does not have to
independently show irreparable harm to obtain injunctive relief for the breach
of

a restrictive covenant. Persimmon Hill First Homes Ass’n v.
Lonsdale, 75 P.3d 278, 282–83 (Kan. App. 2003). * * *

First, Four Colonies argues the Declaration’s commercial use
restriction prohibited the Kiekels from renting their properties. According to

the Declaration, “[n]o building or structure of any sort may
ever be placed, erected or used for business, professional, trade or commercial

purposes on any of the property within [Four Colonies].” * *
*

As we previously indicated, the Declaration neither
expressly prohibits nor expressly permits lot owners to rent their property.
The

Declaration does, however, include three distinct references
to lot owners’ tenants, and in one instance the Declaration defines “resident”
to

include lessees and tenants on the property. It would make
no sense for the Declaration to expressly refer to lessees and tenants and at
the same

time conclude that the rental of property violated the
Declaration’s commercial use restriction.

#757

It appears that the commercial use restriction was intended
to prevent lot owners from using their property as a commercial business. Just

because the Kiekels earn rental income from their property,
this is not the same as conducting a commercial business on the property. As
long as

the Kiekels’ lessees use the property as a residence, there
is no violation of the Declaration’s commercial use restriction. Thus, the
district court

did not err in denying the request to enjoin the Kiekels
from renting their property based upon a violation of the Declaration’s
commercial use

restriction.

Four Colonies also argues the Declaration’s noxious activity
restriction prohibited the Kiekels from renting their properties. According to

the Declaration, “[n]o noxious or offensive activity shall
be carried on within [Four Colonies].. ., nor shall anything ever be done which
may be

or become an annoyance or nuisance to the neighborhood.”
Four Colonies argued to the district court that the Kiekels violated this
restrictive

covenant by failing to maintain their property and by
failing to adequately control their tenants.

In denying injunctive relief, the district court first found
that although Four Colonies had shown that tenants living in the subdivision
were

more likely than property owners to throw disruptive
parties, have unauthorized people living with them, improperly store personal
property, and

fail to clean up after their pets, Four Colonies had failed
to prove that the Kiekels’ tenants were more likely than other tenants to
engage in these

activities. The district court also found that Four Colonies
had failed to prove that the maintenance problems associated with the Kiekels’
rental

properties were worse than the maintenance problems
associated with other properties in the subdivision.

Additionally, the district court concluded that Four
Colonies could have addressed its concerns about the maintenance of the
Kiekels’

properties by taking advantage of its right to restoration.
According to the Bylaws, Four Colonies has a right to restore property that a
lot owner

has failed to maintain and to add the cost of the
restoration to the owner’s annual assessment. On appeal, Four Colonies argues
that its right to

restoration is not an adequate remedy because “there is a
significant risk to paying for these repairs up front, and then hoping to
recoup these

costs from unit owners.” However, the Bylaws allow Four
Colonies to bring a legal action against an owner for the nonpayment of
assessments.

As such, Four Colonies has an action at law to address the
maintenance problems associated with the Kiekels’ property.

Four Colonies was essentially asking the district court to
find that renting itself was a noxious activity. The district court recognized
the

general principle that an injunction is an equitable remedy.
See Persimmon Hill First Homes Ass’n, 75 P. 3d at 281. The district court was

especially concerned about granting the expansive remedy of
enjoining the Kiekels from renting their property in order to prevent specific

instances of noxious activity. Because of the broad scope of

#758

injunctive relief pursued by Four Colonies, we conclude the
district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Four Colonies’ claim for

injunctive relief based upon a violation of the
Declaration’s noxious activity restriction. * * *

Affirmed in part and reversed in part.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Here, in contrast to _Nahrstedt_ and _Pullman_ , the
Kansas court refuses to defer to the will of the majority in the Four Colonies
subdivision. It

regards the right to rent to be a sufficiently important
attribute of property that it cannot be prohibited unless it is proscribed with
clarity in the

declaration (the master deed or the CC&Rs). If the
declaration is ambiguous, or contains language suggesting that renting is
contemplated, renting can

be prohibited only by amending the declaration. A recent
Wisconsin decision reaches the opposite conclusion, finding that the bylaws can
be amended to

prohibit renting even though the declaration contains
language implying that renting is permissible. Apple Valley Gardens Ass’n, Inc.
v. MacHutta, 763

N.W. 2 d 126 (Wis. 2009 ). Which position do you regard as
more sound? Protection of property rights can be invoked in support of either
outcome. The

Kiekels can invoke the tradition of free alienation of
property in support of their position. But the homeowners’ association is
seeking to protect the

property rights of the resident-owners in the complex—not
only the value of their investment but also the quality of the community in
which they live.

2 .One way of interpreting the facts in _Kiekel_ is that
relatively little thought was given to the implications of allowing rentals
when the complex

was initially created. Gradually, over time, a majority of
the residents has concluded that rentals—at least on a large-scale basis—are
corrosive to the

community. If the only way they can change the policy is by
amending the declaration, it may be impossible to stop the corrosion. Such a
change

requires the approval of 75 percent of all owners, and
already about 16 percent are engaged in renting. One reason why renting may be
toxic to a

condominium association is that individual condo owners make
lousy lessors. Like the Kiekels, they are not likely to live on the premises or
to employ a

manager on the premises. They lack much of the incentive
that a full-time lessor has to screen prospective lessees or control lessee
behavior in order to

protect the interests of other residents, because they are
not dependent on the other residents for rental income. If the consequences of
allowing renting

were not fully foreseeable in 1971 , when Four Colonies was
created, should the court be more forgiving of efforts to rein in the practice
of renting units

thirty years later?

3 .Restrictions on renting have also been challenged as
unreasonable restraints on alienation (see Chapter V). Most courts have
rejected these

challenges, at least where sales are freely permitted and
the rule against renting was enunciated before the owner bought into the condo
complex. See

Validity, Construction, and Application of Statutes, or of
Condominium Association’s Bylaws or Regulations, Restricting Sale, Transfer, or
Lease of

Condominium Units, 17 A.L.R. 4 th 1247.

```



759



```

4 .Mixing common interest communities and leasing also
creates problems for lessee. The lessee’s lessor—typically an absentee owner of
one or

more condo units—may be hard to reach when the plumbing
springs a leak or other issues arise. A call to the homeowners’ association or
the manager

of the condo complex will likely bring a response that this
is a problem for individual owners, not something the HOA can address. The
lessee is also

unlikely to have any voice in the affairs of the condo
association, since only owners can vote for officers of the HOA. Thus, if
lessees have certain

preferences that diverge from those of other residents—about
pool hours or parking policy—the lessees’ preferences may be disregarded. And
there is

some evidence that HOAs have attempted to impose
disproportionate costs on renters, for example by charging high “move in/move
out” fees that

disproportionately affect lessees, who tend to move
frequently. See Jonathan D. Ross-Harrington, Property Forms in Tension:
Preference Inefficiency,

Rent-Seeking, and the Problem of Notice in the Modern
Condominium, 28 Yale L. & Pol’y Rev. 187 , 211 ( 2009 ). To top it all off,
if a condo owner falls

behind on his payments on a loan secured by a mortgage on
the unit, the bank typically has the right to foreclose on the mortgage and put
the lessee out

on the street, even if she is completely current on her
rent. The problems posed by these incompatibilities are not insubstantial. It
is estimated that over

2. 1 million condominium units in the U.S. are occupied by
   renters. Id. at 188.

### B. SEPARATING MANAGEMENT AND NONPOSSESSORY INTERESTS IN

PROPERTY

We now turn to entity property devices designed to promote
nonpossessory beneficial enjoyment of assets. The principal entity devices in

this category include trusts, corporations, nonprofit
entities, and partnerships. Because the purpose of these organizational forms
does not entail

any right to possession of any particular assets, the
manager is typically given greater discretion over the use and disposition of
the assets than is

the case with organizational forms designed for the
management of a possessory interest, such as an apartment or space in a
shopping center.

This discretion, however, brings with it the potential for
abuse. Consequently, a central concern in the design of this second category of
entity

property devices is what is sometimes called the
“principal-agent” or “agency cost” problem. See, e.g., Michael C. Jensen &
William H.

Meckling, The Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior,
Agency Costs, and Ownership Structure, 3 J. Fin. Econ. 305 (1976); see also,
e.g.,

M.W. Lau, The Economic Structure of Trusts (2011); Robert H.
Sitkoff, An Agency Costs Theory of Trust Law, 89 Cornell L. Rev. 621 (2004);

Julian Velasco, Fiduciary Principles in Corporate Law, in
The Oxford Handbook of Fiduciary Law 61 (Evan J. Criddle, Paul B. Miller &
Robert

H. Sitkoff eds., 2019). The manager (the trustee, the board
of directors) is supposed to manage the property in the best interests of the
beneficial

owners (the trust beneficiaries, the shareholders). But it
is

#760

often difficult to devise incentives that ensure that the
managers do not deviate from this ideal.

### 1 .TRUSTS

Trusts have a long and complicated history. See generally
George T. Bogert, Trusts ch. 1 (6th ed. 1987). The root idea of the modern
trust is

grounded in the division of authority between the common-law
courts and the Chancery Court, or courts of law and equity. After the Statute
of

Uses of 1540, the law courts recognized only rights of
ownership and possession. But Chancery would recognize and enforce—through

injunctions—certain equitable obligations to hold property
for the benefit of a third person. The consequence was that certain assets came
to have

a dual personality. The legal title to the property was held
in the name of one person (the “trustee”), and this person could call upon the
law

courts to enforce this title against third parties who
entered into contracts pertaining to the property or committed torts against
the property. But

the beneficial use and enjoyment of the property would
belong to someone else (the “beneficiary”), and Chancery would intervene to
make sure

that the legal title holder did not act in ways prejudicial
to the equitable title of this beneficiary.

In its modern evolved form, every trust involves three legal
personas plus at least one thing. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 3 (Am. L.

Inst. 2 003). The legal persona who creates the trust is
known as the settlor. Typically, the settlor owns some property in fee simple
or absolute

title, and grants or conveys this property (without
consideration, at least in return for the property so conveyed) to another
legal persona, the

trustee, in trust. The trustee takes legal title to the
property, and is responsible for managing it, investing in it, and protecting
it against third-party

intrusions. The legal persona for whose benefit the trustee
manages the property is known as the beneficiary. The trustee is subject to a
range of

legal duties, known as fiduciary duties, which constrain the
trustee to manage the property in the best interests of the beneficiary. The

beneficiary, however, is not actively involved in managing
the property nor, in most cases, does the beneficiary have any possessory
interest in

the property. Instead, the beneficiary typically receives
periodic distributions of income from the trust. Finally, the whole arrangement
revolves

around some asset or collection of assets, known as the
corpus of the trust or the trust res. This can include land, personal property,
and

intellectual property rights. But in the modern world, it
increasingly has come to mean stocks, bonds, and other readily-marketable
intangible

assets with income-earning potential.

Although the trust involves three distinct legal personas
(settlor, trustee, beneficiary), it is not necessary that distinct persons play
each of

these roles. For example, in 401(k) retirement plans, the
settlor is an individual seeking to save for her retirement, but the same
person is also

usually the primary beneficiary. In the case of a living
trust, or even a

#761

charitable trust, it is also possible for the settlor and
the trustee to be the same person. Of course, where the settlor wants the trust
to endure after

her death, it is necessary that the settlor appoint someone
else to serve as trustee after the settlor is gone. The one thing that
traditionally has been

prohibited is for one person to serve both as the sole
trustee and the sole beneficiary of a trust. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts
§ 69 (2003).

Trusts can be created by will, by inter vivos transfer of
assets from a settlor to a trustee, or by a declaration of an owner that he
holds

property as trustee for one or more persons. Restatement
(Third) of Trusts § 10 (2003). They can be created to manage the transfer of
assets

within a family from one generation to another, to establish
instruments for charitable giving or the creation of charitable foundations, or
for

certain business purposes (such as where it is important to
segregate assets from routine business transactions in the context of asset

securitization). Putting aside its commercial applications,
“[t]he normal private trust is essentially a gift, projected on the plane of
time and so

subjected to a management regime.” John H. Langbein,
Mandatory Rules in the Law of Trusts, 98 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1 105, 1109 (2004)
(citation

omitted). Thus, trusts are interpreted on the assumption
that the dominant purpose of the settlor was to benefit the beneficiaries.
Under the

Statute of Frauds, express trusts must be in writing. See
Bogert, supra, at 49–55.

Trusts are also one area of law where the common-law forms
of ownership studied in Chapter V continue to play an important role. The

legal title to trust assets is nearly always held in
undivided fee simple or absolute ownership. This permits the trustee to deal
with these assets the

way a full owner would—by buying, selling, leasing, or
mortgaging the assets as market conditions dictate, in order to maximize the
risk-

appropriate return to the trust. The beneficial interest,
however, is often carved up among several beneficiaries spread over multiple
generations.

In order to describe these interests, the law of trusts has
borrowed the categories of the estate system. Thus, we commonly find that one

beneficiary (a spouse for example) is given a life estate in
trust, followed by one or more vested remainders in trust (in the children or

grandchildren, for example). If children or grandchildren
present more complicated contingencies, then contingent remainders or executory

interests in trust can be used. This incorporation of the
estate system to describe beneficial interests has no effect on the deployment
of the

underlying resources, since the trustee is free to deal with
those resources without regard to the law of waste, the rules of contribution
and

accounting, or other rules that apply where legal interests
are carved up using the categories of the estate system. The only function of
the estate

system in the law of trusts is in ascertaining which persons
are to receive, in what amounts, distributions from the trust income and
assets.

The fact that most of the exotic future interests studied in
Chapter V exist today only as beneficial interests in trusts helps explain why

#762

these complications are tolerable from an
information-gathering and enforcement perspective. If contingent remainders and
executory interests

were commonly encountered as in rem rights, they would
greatly complicate the process of processing information about these rights,
certainly

for transactional and secured-lending purposes. But when
these interests exist as beneficial interests in a trust, they do not
complicate

transactions in the underlying assets, which are typically
held in fee simple by the trustee. Thus, the common use of trusts in the
disposition of

family wealth and pension plans permits the system of
property rights to tolerate greater complexity than would be the case if all
interests had to

be held as legal estates.

Trusts afford settlors even greater flexibility through the
use of powers of appointment. A power of appointment arises when a donor of

property by will or trust creates or reserves a power in
some other person to designate the recipient(s) of particular property or
beneficial interests

in property. The recipient of such a power can be either the
trustee or one of the beneficiaries. This affords greater flexibility in
carving up

beneficial interests, but at the cost of greater discretion
in the person exercising the power. This discretion comes in degrees because
powers can

be constrained by donor stipulation in various ways. See
Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 17.1
(2011).

a.SPENDTHRIFT TRUSTS

Scholars sometimes debate whether the trust is a distinctive
form of property, or whether it is simply a type of third-party beneficiary

contract in which the settlor contracts with the trustee to
manage assets for the benefit of the beneficiary. Compare Henry Hansmann &
Ugo

Mattei, The Functions of Trust Law: A Comparative Legal and
Economic Analysis, 73 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 434 (1998) with John H. Langbein, The

Contractarian Basis of the Law of Trusts, 105 Yale L.J. 625
(1995); see also Lau, Economic Structure, supra. One critical point in favor of
the

“property” characterization is that trust assets are
generally treated as being distinct from the assets of both the settlor and the
trustee, and thus

cannot be reached by individual creditors of either the
settlor or the trustee. More controversially, in many jurisdictions the assets
of some trusts

cannot be reached by the individual creditors of the
beneficiaries. In jurisdictions that permit these so-called “spendthrift
trusts,” trust assets are

cordoned off from all but those who have dealt with the
trust qua trust. At least in this sense, the trust can be regarded as a

#### Broadway National Bank v. Adams

```



Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, 1882.



133 Mass. 170.



```

■
MORTON, C. J. The object of this bill in equity is to reach and apply in
payment of the plaintiff’s debt due from the defendant Adams the

income of a trust fund created for his benefit by the will
of his brother. The eleventh article of the will is as follows: “I give the sum
of seventy-

five thousand dollars to my said executors and the survivors
or survivor of them, in trust to invest the same in such manner as to them may
seem

prudent, and to pay the net income thereof, semiannually, to
my said brother Charles W. Adams, during his natural life, such payments to be

made to him personally when convenient, otherwise, upon his
order or receipt in writing; in either case free from the interference or
control of

his creditors, my intention being that the use of said
income shall not be anticipated by assignment. At the decease of my said
brother Charles,

my will is that the net income of said seventy-five thousand
dollars shall be paid to his present wife, in case she survives him, for the
benefit of

herself and all the children of said Charles, in equal
proportions, in the manner and upon the conditions the same as herein directed
to be paid

him during his life, so long as she shall remain single. And
my will is, that, after the decease of said Charles and the decease or second
marriage

of his said wife, the said seventy-five thousand dollars,
together with any accrued interest or income thereon which may remain unpaid,
as herein

above directed, shall be divided equally among all the
children of my said brother Charles, by any and all his wives, and the
representatives of

any deceased child or children by right of representation.”

There is no room for doubt as to the intention of the
testator. It is clear that, if the trustee was to pay the income to the
plaintiff under an

order of the court, it would be in direct violation of the
intention of the testator and of the provisions of his will. The court will not
compel the

trustee thus to do what the will forbids him to do, unless
the provisions and intention of the testator are unlawful.

The question whether the founder of a trust can secure the
income of it to the object of his bounty, by providing that it shall not be
alienable

by him or be subject to be taken by his creditors, has not
been directly adjudicated in this Commonwealth. The tendency of our decisions,

however, has been in favor of such a power in the founder.

It is true that the rule of the common law is, that a man
cannot attach to a grant or transfer of property, otherwise absolute, the
condition that

it shall not be alienated; such condition being repugnant to
the nature of the estate granted. Co. Lit. 223 a; Blackstone Bank v. Davis, 38
Mass.

(21 Pick.) 42 (1838).

Lord Coke gives as the reason of the rule, that “it is
absurd and repugnant to reason that he, that hath no possibility to have the
land revert to

him, should restrain his feoffee in fee simple of all his
power to

#764

alien,” and that this is “against the height and puritie of
a fee simple.” By such a condition, the grantor undertakes to deprive the
property in the

hands of the grantee of one of its legal incidents and
attributes, namely, its alienability, which is deemed to be against public
policy. But the

reasons of the rule do not apply in the case of a transfer
of property in trust. By the creation of a trust like the one before us, the
trust property

passes to the trustee with all its incidents and attributes
unimpaired. He takes the whole legal title to the property, with the power of
alienation;

the cestui que trust [beneficiary] takes the whole legal
title to the accrued income at the moment it is paid over to him. Neither the
principal nor

the income is at any time inalienable.

The question whether the rule of the common law should be
applied to equitable life estates created by will or deed, has been the subject
of

conflicting adjudications by different courts, as is fully
shown in the able and exhaustive arguments of the counsel in this case. As is
stated in

Sparhawk v. Cloon, 125 Mass. 263 (1878), from the time of
Lord Eldon the rule has prevailed in the English Court of Chancery, to the
extent of

holding that when the income of a trust estate is given to
any person (other than a married woman) for life, the equitable estate for life
is

alienable by, and liable in equity to the debts of, the
cestui que trust, and that this quality is so inseparable from the estate that
no provision,

however express, which does not operate as a cesser or
limitation of the estate itself, can protect it from his debts.

The English rule has been adopted in several of the courts
of this country.

Other courts have rejected it, and have held that the
founder of a trust may secure the benefit of it to the object of his bounty, by
providing

that the income shall not be alienable by anticipation, nor
subject to be taken for his debts.

The precise point involved in the case at bar has not been
adjudicated in this Commonwealth; but the decisions of this court which we have

before cited recognize the principle, that, if the intention
of the founder of a trust, like the one before us, is to give to the equitable
life tenant a

qualified and limited, and not an absolute, estate in the
income, such life tenant cannot alienate it by anticipation, and his creditors
cannot reach it

at law or in equity. It seems to us that this principle
extends to and covers the case at bar. The founder of this trust was the
absolute owner of his

property. He had the entire right to dispose of it, either
by an absolute gift to his brother, or by a gift with such restrictions or
limitations, not

repugnant to law, as he saw fit to impose. His clear
intention, as shown in his will, was not to give his brother an absolute right
to the income

which might hereafter accrue upon the trust fund, with the
power of alienating it in advance, but only the right to receive semiannually
the

income of the fund, which upon its payment to him, and not
before, was to become his absolute property. His intentions ought to be carried
out,

unless they are against public policy. There is nothing

#765

in the nature or tenure of the estate given to the cestui
que trust which should prevent this. The power of alienating in advance is not
a necessary

attribute or incident of such an estate or interest, so that
the restraint of such alienation would introduce repugnant or inconsistent
elements.

We are not able to see that it would violate any principles
of sound public policy to permit a testator to give to the object of his bounty
such

a qualified interest in the income of a trust fund, and thus
provide against the improvidence or misfortune of the beneficiary. The only
ground

upon which it can be held to be against public policy is,
that it defrauds the creditors of the beneficiary.

It is argued that investing a man with apparent wealth tends
to mislead creditors, and to induce them to give him credit. The answer is,
that

creditors have no right to rely upon property thus held, and
to give him credit upon the basis of an estate which, by the instrument
creating it, is

declared to be inalienable by him, and not liable for his
debts. By the exercise of proper diligence they can ascertain the nature and
extent of his

estate, especially in this Commonwealth, where all wills and
most deeds are spread upon the public records. There is the same danger of
their

being misled by false appearances and induced to give credit
to the equitable life tenant when the will or deed of trust provides for a
cesser or

limitation over, in case of an attempted alienation, or of
bankruptcy or attachment, and the argument would lead to the conclusion that
the

English rule is equally in violation of public policy. We do
not see why the founder of a trust may not directly provide that his property
shall go

to his beneficiary with the restriction that it shall not be
alienable by anticipation, and that his creditors shall not have the right to
attach it in

advance, instead of indirectly reaching the same result by a
provision for a cesser or a limitation over, or by giving his trustees a
discretion as to

paying it. He has the entire jus disponendi, which imports
that he may give it absolutely, or may impose any restrictions or fetters not
repugnant

to the nature of the estate which he gives. Under our
system, creditors may reach all the property of the debtor not exempted by law,
but they

cannot enlarge the gift of the founder of a trust and take
more than he has given.

The rule of public policy which subjects a debtor’s property
to the payment of his debts, does not subject the property of a donor to the

debts of his beneficiary, and does not give the creditor a
right to complain that, in the exercise of his absolute right of disposition,
the donor has

not seen fit to give the property to the creditor, but has
left it out of his reach.

Whether a man can settle his own property in trust for his
own benefit, so as to exempt the income from alienation by him or attachment in

advance by his creditors, is a different question, which we
are not called upon to consider in this case. But we are of opinion that any
other

person, having the entire right to dispose of his property,
may settle it in trust in favor of a beneficiary, and may provide that it shall
not be

#766

alienated by him by anticipation, and shall not be subject
to be seized by his creditors in advance of its payment to him.

It follows that, under the provisions of the will which we
are considering, the income of the trust fund created for the benefit of the

defendant Adams cannot be reached by attachment, either at
law or in equity, before it is paid to him.

Bill dismissed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The purpose of a spendthrift trust is to provide
financial support for persons who are regarded by the settlor as being less
than fully capable of

managing their own financial affairs. This could be because
of the beneficiary’s age (young or very old), or because the beneficiary is
mentally

incapacitated, or because the beneficiary simply lacks
experience or judgment about worldly affairs. The spendthrift trust not only
provides for

specialized management of the assets dedicated to the
beneficiary’s support, but also assures that irresponsible actions by the
beneficiary will not cause

the size of the trust corpus to diminish below the level the
settlor has deemed appropriate to set aside for the beneficiary’s financial
needs.

2 .A spendthrift trust, of course, does not shield money
from creditors once it has been distributed to the beneficiary. What the
instant decision

holds, and a majority of American jurisdictions concur in
this, is that the settlor may provide in the trust agreement that the interest
of the beneficiary

cannot be attached or garnished by the beneficiary’s
creditors while it is still under the management and control of the trustee.
Creditors therefore will

have to periodically sue the beneficiary, when they
calculate that the beneficiary has received a distribution from the trust, in
an attempt to recover

portions of the debt.

3 .Not everyone has applauded these objectives. John Chipman
Gray, a professor at Harvard Law School, thought that such trusts represented
the

triumph of paternalism over the ethic of individual
responsibility. He wrote: “If there is one sentiment, therefore, which it would
seem to be the part of

all in authority, and particularly of all judges, to
fortify, it is the duty of keeping one’s promises and paying one’s debts.
[Judges approving spendthrift

trusts were moved] by that spirit, in short, of paternalism,
which is the fundamental essence alike of spendthrift trusts and of socialism.”
John Chipman

Gray, Restraints on the Alienation of Property iii, ix ( 2 d
ed. 1895 ). Note that Gray did not object to large inheritances of wealth. His
objection was to

inheritances coupled with spendthrift clause protection. Can
you articulate why someone like Gray might regard the ability to couple
inheritance with

spendthrift protection as presenting a much more troubling
incursion on the ethic of individual responsibility than does large inheritance
standing alone?

4 .One of the objections to the creation of spendthrift
trusts is that creditors of the beneficiary may not have notice that the assets
sustaining the

beneficiary cannot be reached to satisfy the beneficiary’s
personal debts. This is a version of the problem of “ostensible ownership,”
which we consider

```



767



```

further in Chapter VII. The court says that this objection
has little force in the context of spendthrift trusts, given that deeds to
property are publicly

recorded and wills are made public when they are probated.
This does not cover all of the options, however, because it is also possible to
create a trust

while one is alive (called an inter vivos trust), and such a
trust, including one having a spendthrift provision, could not be discovered by
creditors by

searching through records of deeds and probated wills. Also,
how realistic is it to expect ordinary trade creditors (such as department
stores and auto

dealers) to engage in a search of property deeds and wills
before extending credit to someone like Charles W. Adams?

5 .The traditional understanding has been that spendthrift
clauses can be imposed only on trusts created for the benefit of others; one
cannot set up

a trust for oneself protected by a spendthrift provision.
See, e.g., Restatement (Third) of Trusts §§ 58 ( 2 ) & 60 , cmt. f ( 2003
). This understanding is

beginning to break down as several states, evidently in the
interest of attracting trust business, have enacted statutes permitting the
creation of self-

settled “asset protection trusts.” See Jesse Dukeminier
& Robert H. Sitkoff, Wills, Trusts, and Estates 712 – 24 ( 10 th ed. 2017
). If John Chipman Gray

was so upset about spendthrift trusts for the benefit of
others, what would he say about self-settled spendthrift trusts? If state
legislatures cannot be

counted on to reject such ideas, what remedy is there to
stop their spread? See Symposium: Trust Law in the 21 st Century: Policy,
Logic, and Persuasion

in the Evolving Realm of Trust Asset Protection, 27 Cardozo
L. Rev. 2621 ( 2006 ); Stewart E. Sterk, Asset Protection Trusts: Trust Law’s
Race to the

Bottom?, 85 Cornell L. Rev. 1035 ( 2000 ); Note, Dynasty
Trusts and the Rule Against Perpetuities, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 2588 ( 2003 ).

b.TRUST FIDUCIARY DUTIES

A pervasive difficulty created by the trust is making sure
that the trustee follows the instructions of the settlor and exercises his
managerial

discretion in the interest of the beneficiaries. The settlor
is often not around (indeed is often dead), and so cannot monitor the
performance of the

trustee. The beneficiaries may be very young,
unsophisticated, or highly dispersed, making effective monitoring by the
beneficiaries equally

problematic. The law’s solution to the monitoring problem
has been to impose a series of duties on the trustee, called fiduciary duties,
which are

designed to ensure that the trustee acts in the best
interests of the trust and the beneficiaries, rather than using the trust res
and powers given by

the trust instrument for self-enrichment. Courts enforce
these fiduciary duties quite strictly. We do not have the space here to provide
a complete

review of all trust fiduciary duties. For overviews, see
Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Prudent Investor Rule (Am. L. Inst. 1990);
Bogert, supra, at

334–449; The Oxford Handbook of Fiduciary Law (Evan J.
Criddle, Paul B. Miller & Robert H. Sitkoff eds., 2019). The following case
is

illustrative of the types of problems that can arise, and of
the attitude of the courts when breaches of fiduciary duties are exposed.

#### Rothko v. Reis

```



Court of Appeals of New York, 1977.



372 N.E. 2 d 291.



```

■ COOKE,
JUDGE. Mark Rothko, an abstract expressionist painter whose works through the
years gained for him an international reputation of

greatness, died testate on February 25, 1970. The principal
asset of his estate consisted of 798 paintings of tremendous value, and the
dispute

underlying this appeal involves the conduct of his three
executors in their disposition of these works of art. In sum, that conduct as
portrayed in

the record and sketched in the opinions was manifestly
wrongful and indeed shocking.

Creative Photography, University of Arizona. ©1991 Hans Namuth Estate.

[Rothko’s] will was admitted to probate on April 27, 1970
and letters testamentary were issued to Bernard J. Reis, Theodoros Stamos and

Morton Levine. Hastily and within a period of only about
three weeks and by virtue of two contracts each dated May 21, 1970, the
executors

dealt with all 798 paintings.

By a contract of sale, the estate executors agreed to sell
to Marlborough A.G., a Liechtenstein corporation (hereinafter MAG), 100 Rothko

paintings as listed for $1,800,000, $200,000 to be paid on
execution of the agreement and the balance of $1,600,000 in 12 equal
interest-free

installments over a 12-year period. Under the second

#769

agreement, the executors consigned to Marlborough Gallery,
Inc., a domestic corporation (hereinafter MNY), “approximately 700 paintings

listed on a Schedule to be prepared”, the consignee to be
responsible for costs covering items such as insurance, storage[,] restoration
and

promotion. By its provisos, MNY could sell up to 35
paintings a year from each of two groups, pre-1947 and post-1947, for 12 years
at the best

price obtainable but not less than the appraised estate
value, and it would receive a 50% Commission on each painting sold, except for
a

commission of 40% on those sold to or through other dealers.

Petitioner Kate Rothko, decedent’s daughter and a person
entitled to share in his estate by virtue of an election under EPTL 5–3.3,
instituted

this proceeding to remove the executors, to enjoin MNY and
MAG from disposing of the paintings, to rescind the aforesaid agreements
between

the executors and said corporations, for a return of the
paintings still in possession of those corporations, and for damages. She was
joined by the

guardian of her brother Christopher Rothko, likewise
interested in the estate, who answered by adopting the allegations of his
sister’s petition and

by demanding the same relief. The Attorney-General of the
State, as the representative of the ultimate beneficiaries of the Mark Rothko

Foundation, Inc., a charitable corporation and the residuary
legatee under decedent’s will, joined in requesting relief substantially
similar to that

prayed for by petitioner. * * *

Following a nonjury trial covering 89 days and in a thorough
opinion, the Surrogate found: that Reis was a director, secretary and treasurer

of MNY, the consignee art gallery, in addition to being a
coexecutor of the estate; that the testator had a 1969 inter vivos contract
with MNY to

sell Rothko’s work at a commission of only 10% and whether
that agreement survived testator’s death was a problem that a fiduciary in a
dual

position could not have impartially faced; that Reis was in
a position of serious conflict of interest with respect to the contracts of May
21, 1970

and that his dual role and planned purpose benefited the
Marlborough interests to the detriment of the estate; that it was to the
advantage of

coexecutor Stamos as a “not-too-successful artist,
financially”, to curry favor with Marlborough and that the contract made by him
with MNY

within months after signing the estate contracts placed him
in a position where his personal interests conflicted with those of the estate,

especially leading to lax contract enforcement efforts by
Stamos; that Stamos acted negligently and improvidently in view of his own
knowledge

of the conflict of interest of Reis; that the third
coexecutor, Levine, while not acting in self-interest or with bad faith,
nonetheless failed to

exercise ordinary prudence in the performance of his assumed
fiduciary obligations since he was aware of Reis’ divided loyalty, believed
that

Stamos was also seeking personal advantage, possessed
personal opinions as to the value of the paintings and yet followed the
leadership of his

coexecutors without investigation of essential facts or
consultation

#770

with competent and disinterested appraisers, and that the
business transactions of the two Marlborough corporations were admittedly
controlled

and directed by Francis K. Lloyd. It was concluded that the
acts and failures of the three executors were clearly improper to such a
substantial

extent as to mandate their removal under SCPA 711 as estate
fiduciaries. The Surrogate also found that MNY, MAG and Lloyd were guilty of

contempt in shipping, disposing of and selling 57 paintings
in violation of the temporary restraining order dated June 26, 1972 and of the

injunction dated September 26, 1972; that the contracts for
sale and consignment of paintings between the executors and MNY and MAG

provided inadequate value to the estate, amounting to a lack
of mutuality and fairness resulting from conflicts on the part of Reis and
Stamos and

improvidence on the part of all executors; that said
contracts were voidable and were set aside by reason of violation of the duty
of loyalty and

improvidence of the executors, knowingly participated in and
induced by MNY and MAG; that the fact that these agreements were voidable did

not revive the 1969 inter vivos agreements since the parties
by their conduct evinced an intent to abandon and abrogate these compacts. The

Surrogate held that the present value at the time of trial
of the paintings sold is the proper measure of damages as to MNY, MAG, Lloyd,
Reis

and Stamos. He imposed a civil fine of $3,332,000 upon MNY,
MAG and Lloyd, same being the appreciated value at the time of trial of the 57

paintings sold in violation of the temporary restraining
order and injunction. It was held that Levine was liable for $6,464,880 in
damages, as he

was not in a dual position acting for his own interest and
was thus liable only for the actual value of paintings sold MNY and MAG as of
the

dates of sale, and that Reis, Stamos, MNY and MAG, apart
from being jointly and severally liable for the same damages as Levine for

negligence, were liable for the greater sum of $9,252,000
“as appreciation damages less amounts previously paid to the estate with regard
to sales

of paintings.” * * * The liabilities were held to be
congruent so that payment of the highest sum would satisfy all lesser
liabilities including the

civil fines and the liabilities for damages were to be
reduced by payment of the fine levied or by return of any of the 57 paintings
disposed of, the

new fiduciary to have the option in the first instance to
specify which paintings the fiduciary would accept.

The Appellate Division * * * affirmed * * *

In seeking a reversal, it is urged that an improper legal
standard was applied in voiding the estate contracts of May, 1970, that the “no

further inquiry” rule applies only to self-dealing and that
in case of a conflict of interest, absent self-dealing, a challenged
transaction must be

shown to be unfair. The subject of fairness of the contracts
is intertwined with the issue of whether Reis and Stamos were guilty of
conflicts of

interest.^2 Scott is quoted to the effect that “[a] trustee
does not

#771

necessarily incur liability merely because he has an
individual interest in the transaction * * * In Bullivant v. First Nat. Bank
(141 N.E. 41 (Mass.

1923)) it was held that * * * the fact that the bank was
also a creditor of the corporation did not make its assent invalid, if it acted
in good faith

and the plan was fair” (2 Scott, Trusts, § 17 0.24, p. 1384
(emphasis added)), and our attention has been called to the statement in Phelan
v.

Middle States Oil Corp., 220 F.2d 593, 603 (2d Cir. 1955),
where Judge Learned Hand found “no decisions that have applied (the no further

inquiry rule) inflexibly to every occasion in which the
fiduciary has been shown to have had a personal interest that might in fact
have conflicted

with his loyalty.”

These contentions should be rejected. First, a review of the
opinions of the Surrogate and the Appellate Division manifests that they did
not

rely solely on a “no further inquiry rule”, and secondly,
there is more than an adequate basis to conclude that the agreements between
the

Marlborough corporations and the estate were neither fair
nor in the best interests of the estate. This is demonstrated, for example, by
the

comments of the Surrogate concerning the commissions on the
consignment of the 698 paintings and those of the Appellate Division concerning

the sale of the 100 paintings. The opinions under review
demonstrate that neither the Surrogate nor the Appellate Division set aside the
contracts

by merely applying the no further inquiry rule without
regard to fairness. Rather they determined, quite properly indeed, that these
agreements

were neither fair nor in the best interests of the estate.

To be sure, the assertions that there were no conflicts of
interest on the part of Reis or Stamos indulge in sheer fantasy. Besides being
a

director and officer of MNY, for which there was financial
remuneration, however slight, Reis, as noted by the Surrogate, had different

inducements to favor the Marlborough interests, including
his own aggrandizement of status and financial advantage through sales of
almost one

million dollars for items from his own and his family’s
extensive private art collection by the Marlborough interests. Similarly,
Stamos benefited

as an artist under contract with Marlborough and,
interestingly, Marlborough purchased a Stamos painting from a third party for
$4,000 during

the week in May, 1970 when the estate contract negotiations
were pending. The conflicts are manifest. Further, as noted in Bogert, Trusts
and

Trustees (2d ed.), “The duty of loyalty imposed on the
fiduciary prevents him from accepting employment from a third party who is
entering into

a business transaction with the trust” (§ 543, subd. (S), p.
573). “While he [a trustee] is administering the trust he must refrain from
placing

himself in a position where his personal interest or

#772

that of a third person does or may conflict with the
interest of the beneficiaries” (Bogert, Trusts (Hornbook Series 5th ed.), p.
343). Here, Reis

was employed and Stamos benefited in a manner contemplated
by Bogert. In short, one must strain the law rather than follow it to reach the

result suggested on behalf of Reis and Stamos.

Levine contends that, having acted prudently and upon the
advice of counsel, a complete defense was established. Suffice it to say, an

executor who knows that his coexecutor is committing
breaches of trust and not only fails to exert efforts directed towards
prevention but

accedes to them is legally accountable even though he was
acting on the advice of counsel. When confronted with the question of whether
to

enter into the Marlborough contracts, Levine was acting in a
business capacity, not a legal one, in which he was required as an executor
primarily

to employ such diligence and prudence to the care and
management of the estate assets and affairs as would prudent persons of
discretion and

intelligence, accented by “[n]ot honesty alone, but the
punctilio of an honor the most sensitive” (Meinhard v. Salmon, 164 N.E. 545,
546 (N.Y.

1928)). Alleged good faith on the part of a fiduciary
forgetful of his duty is not enough. He could not close his eyes, remain
passive or move with

unconcern in the face of the obvious loss to be visited upon
the estate by participation in those business arrangements and then shelter
himself

behind the claimed counsel of an attorney.

Further, there is no merit to the argument that MNY and MAG
lacked notice of the breach of trust. The record amply supports the

determination that they are chargeable with notice of the
executors’ breach of duty.

The measure of damages was the issue that divided the
Appellate Division. The contention of Reis, Stamos, MNY and MAG, that the award

of appreciation damages was legally erroneous and
impermissible, is based on a principle that an executor authorized to sell is
not liable for an

increase in value if the breach consists only in selling for
a figure less than that for which the executor should have sold. For example,
Scott

states:

The beneficiaries are not entitled to the value of the
property at the time of the decree if it was not the duty of the trustee to
retain

the property in the trust and the breach of trust consisted
merely in selling the property for too low a price. (3 Scott, Trusts (3d ed.),

§ 208.3, p. 1687 (emphasis added)).

If the trustee is guilty of a breach of trust in selling
trust property for an inadequate price, he is liable for the difference between

the amount he should have received and the amount which he
did receive. He is not liable, however, for any subsequent rise in value of

the property sold. (Id., § 208.6, pp. 1689–1690.)

#773

A recitation of similar import appears in Comment d under
Restatement, Trusts 2d (§ 205): “d. Sale for less than value. If the trustee is

authorized to sell trust property, but in breach of trust he
sells it for less than he should receive, he is liable for the value of the
property at the

time of the sale less the amount which he received. If the
breach of trust consists only in selling it for too little, he is not
chargeable with the

amount of any subsequent increase in value of the property
under the rule stated in Clause (c), as he would be if he were not authorized
to sell the

property. See § 208.” (Emphasis added.) However, employment
of “merely” and “only” as limiting words suggests that where the breach
consists

of some misfeasance, other than solely for selling “for too
low a price” or “for too little”, appreciation damages may be appropriate.
Under Scott

(§ 208 .3, pp. 1686–1687) and the Restatement (§ 208), the
trustee may be held liable for appreciation damages if it was his or her duty
to retain

the property, the theory being that the beneficiaries are
entitled to be placed in the same position they would have been in had the
breach not

consisted of a sale of property that should have been
retained. The same rule should apply where the breach of trust consists of a
serious conflict

of interest which is more than merely selling for too
little.

The reason for allowing appreciation damages, where there is
a duty to retain, and only date of sale damages, where there is authorization
to

sell, is policy oriented. If a trustee authorized to sell
were subjected to a greater measure of damages he might be reluctant to sell
(in which event

he might run a risk if depreciation ensued). On the other
hand, if there is a duty to retain and the trustee sells there is no policy
reason to protect

the trustee; he has not simply acted imprudently, he has
violated an integral condition of the trust * * *

Here, the executors, though authorized to sell, did not
merely err in the amount they accepted but sold to one with whom Reis and
Stamos

had a self-interest. * * * [S]ince the paintings cannot be
returned, the estate is therefore entitled to their value at the time of the
decree, i. e.,

appreciation damages. These are not punitive damages in a
true sense, rather they are damages intended to make the estate whole. Of
course, as

to Reis, Stamos, MNY and MAG, these damages might be
considered by some to be exemplary in a sense, in that they serve as a warning
to

others, but their true character is ascertained when viewed
in the light of overriding policy considerations and in the realization that
the sale and

consignment were not merely sales below value but inherently
wrongful transfers which should allow the owner to be made whole.

The decree of the Surrogate imposed appreciation damages
against Reis, Stamos, MNY and MAG in the amount of $7,339,464.72

computed as $9,252,000 (86 works on canvas at $90,000 each
and 54 works on paper at $28,000 each) less the aggregate amounts paid the
estate

under the two rescinded agreements and interest. Appellants
chose not to offer evidence of “present value” * * *. Under the circumstances,
it

was impossible to appraise the value of the unreturned works
of art with an

#774

absolute certainty and, so long as the figure arrived at had
a reasonable basis of computation and was not merely speculative, possible or

imaginary, the Surrogate had the right to resort to
reasonable conjectures and probable estimates and to make the best
approximation possible

through the exercise of good judgment and common sense in
arriving at that amount. This is particularly so where the conduct of
wrongdoers has

rendered it difficult to ascertain the damages suffered with
the precision otherwise possible. Significantly, the Surrogate’s factual
finding as to the

present value of these unreturned paintings was affirmed by
the Appellate Division and, since that finding had support in the record and
was not

legally erroneous, it should not now be subjected to our
disturbance. * * *

We have considered the other alleged errors urged by the
parties, and find those arguments to be without merit. In short, we find no
basis for

disturbing the result reached below.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .For further background, see Lee Seldes, The Legacy of
Mark Rothko ( 1979 ). Seldes regards the case as “the greatest art scandal” of
the century.

Bernard Reis was a close confidant of Rothko and served as
his principal advisor on financial and business matters. He drafted the will
that named

himself, Stamos, and Levine as the executors of Rothko’s
estate and as directors of the Rothko Foundation. The will left no paintings to
Rothko’s

estranged widow or his two children, Kate and Christopher.
Rothko’s widow, Mell, died shortly after Rothko committed suicide, leaving the
two

children orphans. Through their guardians and lawyers, they
elected to take a forced share, equal to one-half the estate under New York
law, and brought

suit to rescind the sweetheart contract the executors had
made with Marlborough. Seldes portrays Frank Lloyd, the director of the
Marlborough Gallery,

as the mastermind who induced Reis and the other executors
to breach their duties to the estate. He gave Reis and Stamos retainers that
put them in a

conflict of interest with the estate and pushed successfully
for the sweetheart contract. After the New York Court of Appeals affirmed the
judgment,

Lloyd was indicted for tampering with evidence, and fled to
the Bahamas to avoid extradition. Nevertheless, he returned the paintings that
had been

spirited out of the country in violation of the injunction
and paid off the judgment in full. Bernard Reis, his assets exhausted by the
litigation, filed for

bankruptcy.

2 .Although technically this decision involves the duties of
the executors of an estate, as the court notes in footnote 2 executors act as
trustees for

the creditors and the beneficiaries of the estate. The court
draws upon concepts of fiduciary duty, especially the duty of loyalty and the
duty of prudence,

developed in the context of trust management, and its
conclusions would be equally applicable to the management of a family trust.
See The Oxford

Handbook of Fiduciary Law, supra.

3 .Would the terms of the contract with Marlborough justify
a finding of breach of fiduciary duty standing on their own? Notice that Rothko

entered

#775

into a contract before his death giving Marlborough the
exclusive right to sell his paintings at a 10 % commission. This would tend to
suggest that there

was nothing inherently prejudicial to the estate in
appointing Marlborough the exclusive sales agent. The executors also instructed
the agent that after

the initial batch of paintings was sold, sales were to be
limited to 35 paintings per year. This was designed to prevent flooding the
market with Rothkos

and driving down the price of the paintings. The principal
bone of contention seems to be that the executors agreed to a higher
commission— 50 % as

opposed to 10 % under the contract with Rothko. But is it
clear that the 50 % commission would result in a lower net value to the estate
than a 10 %

commission? Presumably Marlborough has a greater incentive
under a 50 % commission to work hard to sell the paintings at a high price. How
is a court

to decide whether agreeing to a 50 % commission as opposed
to a 10 % commission is a breach of fiduciary duty? Suppose instead the estate
agreed to

sell all the paintings to Marlborough for $ 1 million
dollars in cash, and several years later they are worth $ 5 million. Would the
contract necessarily be

suspect? Would anyone complain if, instead of appreciating,
the value of the paintings crashed in later years?

4 .Here, of course, there was more than what appears to be a
one-sided contract with Marlborough. Reis was a director and officer (and had
an

undisclosed retainer) with the gallery and was eager to
enlist Marlborough in selling art from his own collection. Stamos was also
under contract with

Marlborough and anxious to curry the gallery’s favor. Levine
was not charged with any conflict of interest but was said to have acted
imprudently by not

objecting to the conflicts of Reis and Stamos. Would these
conflicts be enough to remove the executors and charge them with millions of
dollars in

damages liability if they had negotiated a highly beneficial
deal for the estate? Is there any claim that any of the executors stands to
profit directly from

the contract with Marlborough?

5 .More controversial is the court’s upholding “appreciation
damages” against Reis, Stamos, and Marlborough galleries (but not Levine).
Assume

the appraised value of a Rothko painting was $ 100 , 000 at
his death, was sold by Marlborough for $ 200 , 000 at a time when it had an
appraised value of

$ 300 , 000 and had a value of $ 400 , 000 when the trial
court entered the decree finding a breach of fiduciary duty. Because the
executors were authorized

to sell the paintings for the benefit of the estate, the
measure of damages would ordinarily be $ 300 , 000 minus $ 200 , 000 , or $ 100
, 000 —that is, the

difference between the appraised value at the time of the
sale and the amount obtained through the sale. The court rules, however, that
the damages are

$ 400 , 000 minus $ 200 , 000 , or $ 200 , 000 —that is, the
difference between the appraised value at the time of the decree and the amount
actually obtained

through sale. Was the award of appreciation damages in
_Rothko_ a disguised form of punitive damages? See Richard V. Wellman, Punitive
Surcharges

Against Disloyal Fiduciaries—Is _Rothko_ Right?, 77 Mich. L.
Rev. 95 ( 1978 ) (arguing that the damages award was excessive and that
decision will cause

fiduciaries to be excessively cautious in disposing of
artwork and other assets with uncertain value). Or is it an indirect way of
imposing a constructive

trust on Reis, Stamos, and Marlborough—a “constructive
constructive trust,”

```



776



```

as it were? In a constructive trust, a wrongdoer will be
treated as holding property taken from another as if he were a trustee for the
victim and must

disgorge not only the amount taken but all proceeds,
including appreciation, attributable to the asset—its “traceable product.”
Restatement Third,

Restitution and Unjust Enrichment §§ 55 , 59. Various
presumptions, some of them looking like extreme versions of the accession
principles we saw in

Chapter III, may apply in favor of the victim and against
the wrongdoer. In any event, it is clear that we do not want trustees to be
reckless with assets

held in trust. What is wrong with rules that make trustees
excessively cautious?

c.CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES

One of the recurring problems with interests that persist
over long periods of time is that conditions may change in ways that may not
have

been foreseeable to someone at the time the interest was
created. Situations of this sort arise with particular frequency in the
charitable trust

context. The doctrine of cy pres traditionally operates
where a settlor (who cannot be consulted) has expressed a specific charitable
intent that,

due to changed circumstances, is impossible or undesirable
to fulfill, but where the settlor also expressed a related general charitable
intent that

could still be fulfilled with some judicial modification of
the interests created. For example, a trust may provide that a house is to be
used as a

hospital in a particular town, but it turns out that the
hospital in a neighboring village adequately serves the needs of the community.
See In re

Neher, 18 N.E.2d 625 (N.Y. 1939) (employing cy pres to allow
the town to use the house for administrative purposes). The proper grounds and

degree of judicial intervention remain controversial.
Consider the following case.

#### Wilber v. Owens

```



Supreme Court of New Jersey, 1949.



65 A. 2 d 843.



```

■ HEHER,
JUSTICE. The bill of complaint [by Charles P. Wilber, as sole acting executor
of the last will of William Brokaw Bamford, deceased,

against John Owens and Asbury Park National Bank & Trust
Company, the Trustees of Princeton University, and others] seeks a construction
of

the will of William Brokaw Bamford, deceased.

The appeal is from the decretal findings that the testator
had “a general charitable intent” ( 142 N.J.Eq. 99, 59 A.2d 570, 584) and the
“trust

created by” the tenth paragraph of the will “is a valid
charitable trust,” and also from the direction that the executor pay over the
corpus of the

trust to the Trustees of Princeton University “in trust to
invest and reinvest the same, and to use the income in some fitting manner for
scientific

and philosophical research in its Department of Philosophy
as said Trustees of Princeton may in their best judgment decide.”

#777

The avowed purpose of this provision of the will was the
creation of a trust, to be known as the “Exton-Bamford Research Fund,” and the

use of “the income thereof in some fitting manner to
continue and carry forward to a completion and to publish for popular
understanding the

results of the researches contained or outlined in” the
testator’s “manuscript entitled ‘Random Scientific Notes seeking the Essentials
in Place

and Space’ or by whatever future title” he “might designate
them.”

The learned Vice Chancellor found that the “Random Notes”
are “irrational, unintelligible, and of no scientific or other value”; that
“the

express purpose of the trust created by” the cited paragraph
of the will “is impossible of accomplishment;” that the testator had “a general

charitable intent and the trust” so created “is a valid
charitable trust;” and that under the doctrine of cy pres Chancery was
empowered to direct

the use of the trust fund “to carry out, as near as may be,
the testator’s general intent and purpose”: hence, the provision for the use of
the income

for “scientific and philosophical research” by Princeton
University, who was named by the testator as the ultimate trustee for the
execution of the

trust if those given the prior option of service should
decline to accept the trust on the terms and conditions laid down in the will.

First, the insistence is that the testator did not have a
general charitable intent. It is said that the testator’s “purpose” cannot be

“disassociated from his Notes;” that while he indicated the
“thought” that “his notes would be of world benefit,” his “basic and
fundamental

purpose, desire and intent” was simply the “completion and
publication for popular understanding of the results of his researches”; and
that this

was “paramount and vital,” and not subordinate to a general
charitable intent, and a construction “severing the decedent’s intent from his

Random Notes” would run counter to “the express terms of the
will, the testimony and the evidence, all of which deny the existence of a
general

charitable intent.”

The testamentary expression is not to be so narrowly read.
It reveals a general charitable intent. The testator’s dominant purpose was the

devotion of his property to uses which are charitable. He
gave what he considered was the bulk of his wealth to the charitable use
provided in the

tenth paragraph of the will. As it turned out, the bequest
was far in excess of the value of his estate. The amount thus bequeathed was
$150,000;

and the bequest was conditioned upon the raising of a like
sum by the trustee, the whole to constitute the principal of the trust in
perpetuity. But

the fulfillment of the trust was not made to depend upon the
provision of the additional principal. In the event that the several trustees
should

refuse acceptance of the trust so conditioned, the same
bequest was made, first to the League of Nations and, in case of a refusal, to
Princeton

University, in trust “for the same purposes, but upon any
satisfactory terms and conditions by which” such accepting trustee “will agree
to

endeavor to carry out the purposes of this bequest and trust
so

#778

that the results may be of benefit to the entire world.”
Such trustee was authorized to do the work attending the execution of the trust
by its “own

staff or by assignment to scientists or other qualified
workers who believe that the common good of the worthy and meritorious of all
mankind is

greater than that of an isolated part.”

Then came a series of specific and pecuniary legacies, the
pecuniary legacies totaling $34,600, many of them charitable, but none to
become

effective until after “the provisions” of the tenth and
other preceding paragraphs of the will “have been fully complied with.” There
was prior

provision of $15,000 for the preservation of his “Random
Notes” and for a scientific analysis and appraisal of the “researches” therein

“outlined,” to the end that such “researches” be made
available “for the use and

#779

benefit of all mankind,” if they “have any practical value.”
And, by the thirty-third paragraph of the will, the “residue” of the testator’s
estate was

constituted a trust designated as the “Exton-Bamford Trust,”
to be administered by a “voluntary association” composed of designated

“representative” second cousins.

This latter trust was to continue until the youngest of his
second cousins attained the age of fifty years, when the corpus was to be
divided

equally among such of his second cousins therein mentioned
as should then be living. Meanwhile, the income was to be “used and applied to

promote the well being of mankind and more especially the
social, physical and economic welfare and efficiency of any of my relatives who
are

worthy and deserving and are in special need of such
assistance, or of any of my relatives who have * * * acquired special merit in
their own

lives through their efforts to help others beyond their
ordinary duty or obligation.” Authority was also given to apply such income “to
the use and

benefit of any worthy charitable, benevolent or educational
purpose; or for the establishment and maintenance of any endowments or
memorials”

as may be found “to be appropriate following where
reasonably possible the spirit of the various provisions of my will or of my
Random

Scientific Notes”. In this paragraph the testator urged his
kin to find “a fitting way” to “overcome the evil effects of direct inheritance
of

unearned property.” In the event that such voluntary
association should not for any reason be “set up or maintained,” or if the
income should not

be spent by such association as provided in the will, or if
all of the second cousins therein appointed to form and maintain the
association should

die “before the youngest one shall have attained the age of
fifty years,” then the residue of his estate would pass to the National Academy
of

Sciences at Washington, “in trust, as far as may be
possible, as set forth to establish the ‘Exton-Bamford Research Fund’ for the
purposes and

under the same terms and conditions as provided” in the
tenth paragraph of the will.

A general charitable intention is outstanding in these
provisions. The design of the trust created by the tenth paragraph is the
advancement

of education and learning, and therefore it is a charitable
trust. Trusts for the advancement of knowledge by research or otherwise are
charitable.

A gift for the benefit of an indefinite number of persons,
by bringing their minds or hearts under the influence of education or religion,
among

other purposes, is a charity in the legal sense. A trust is
charitable if the subject property is devoted to the accomplishment of purposes
which are

beneficial or may be supposed to be beneficial to the
community. This is the prime distinction between private trusts and charitable
trusts. The

question is whether the accomplishment of the purpose is of
such social interest to the community as to justify the dedication of the
property to

that purpose in perpetuity. Are the persons to benefit of a
sufficiently large or indefinite class to give rise to community interest in
the trust? Will

the trust in operation advance the

#780

religious, educational, eleemosynary, governmental or other
charitable interests of the community? Woodstown National Bank & Trust Co.
v.

Snelbaker, 40 A.2d 222 (N.J. Ch. 1944), affirmed, 44 A.2d
210 (N.J. 1945); Scott on Trusts, sections 348, 364, 368.

It was obviously not the testator’s design to confine the
trust created in paragraph ten to the mere publication of his “Random
Scientific

Notes” and the “results” of his “researches.” He believed
that the subject matter of the Notes provided the core for continued
philosophic and

metaphysical research that would be of inestimable benefit
to mankind. The quantum of the trust fund, to run in perpetuity, is itself
significant of

this intention. He had evolved a social philosophy in which
the economic “parasite” had no part. His worldly goods were largely inherited;
and it

was his belief that inherited wealth lays upon the possessor
the solemn duty and responsibility of making “worthy use” of the inheritance.
He had

no kin nearer than first cousins; and he had determined to
devote the major part of his property to the service and enrichment of his
fellows. He

sought to add “a small bit to the sum-total of desirable
human knowledge, for the use and benefit of mankind.” This we find in the
“Introduction”

to the first volume of his Notes. True, his Notes
contributed nothing to the sum of human knowledge; and their development would
not add to

wisdom. Indeed, they have been termed “irrational and
incoherent.” Dr. Scoon said a part was understandable and a part not. Yet to
the testator

the text was real and vital and entirely reasonable and in
keeping with his own meager understanding of the subject. No doubt, the
testator’s

limited knowledge of the matter rendered him incapable of
assessing the importance of his findings. Perhaps, he was not sufficiently
tutored in

the subject to voice with any degree of accuracy the
thoughts that were striving for expression. But there can be no doubt of his
ceaseless

yearning to be of service to human kind and to use his
property to that end. He conceived that his reflections and conclusions would
provide the

basis and the impetus for philosophic research that would in
the end be socially constructive and otherwise serve the common good; but the

charitable intent does not depend upon the scientific
validity of his views or the depth of his understanding. We are not concerned
with his

philosophic or sociologic orthodoxy or rationality. Whatever
the utility of his contribution, his undoubted aim was the use of his Notes as
the

beginning of an undertaking that would in scientific hands
redound to the advantage of mankind. That was his avowed purpose. The will
abounds

in expressions to that effect. And in a summary or outline
of his Notes, dictated shortly before his death, he declared that “The present
world

conditions and the critical post-war problems of world wide
adjustments present a challenge to any thinking which offers promise of
improved

human relationships.” This is an understandable commentary
and a wholly rational aspiration, although the cynic would say an aspiration

foredoomed. In a letter to Dr. Bowman, the President of
Johns Hopkins College, written in 1935, he spoke of the trust as a means “to
carry

forward a research work in pure science at

#781

which I was then and still am active.” And to Dr. Millikan
he wrote, in the same year, of the execution of a will, still subsisting,
bequeathing a

trust fund of $150,000 “to carry forward a prosearch work in
pure science at which I was then and still am active”. But he realized that the

content of his Notes might prove to be of little or no
practical value. He knew the Notes were incomplete; his dominant purpose was
continued

research in the chosen field for the common benefit.

While the content of the Notes themselves may be wanting in
scientific coherence and rationality, the ultimate aim of the testator was not

irrational or absurd, and therefore the trust does not fail
on this account. His was a “search for truth,” not the propagation of nonsense
or folly or

the dissemination of absurd ideas. Even where the opinion
sought to be propagated is “foolish or * * * devoid of foundation,” the bequest
is not

necessarily void as a charitable use. Thorton v. Howe, 31
Beav. 14, 54 Eng. Rep. 1042 (Ch. 1862). In an early case in Massachusetts, the
court

upheld a trust to establish and maintain a school to be
taught by females in which no books of instruction were to be used except
spelling books

and the Bible. Tainter v. Clark, 5 Allen 66 (Mass. 1862). If
the general purposes for which the trust is created may reasonably be regarded
as in

the interest of the community, the mere fact that the
members of the court and the vast majority of the people believe that the
particular purpose

is unwise does not serve to render the trust noncharitable.
In an Irish case, upholding a trust to promote vegetarianism, Lord Justice Fitz
Gibbon

said that the test of beneficence is met if the “benefit” is
“one which the founder believes to be of public advantage,” and “his belief” is
“at least

rational, and not contrary either to the general law of the
land, or the principles of morality.” He continued: “A gift of such a
character, dictated

by benevolence, believed to be beneficent, devoted to an
appreciably important object, and neither contra bonos mores nor contra legem,
will, in

my opinion, be charitable in the eye of the law, as settled
by decisions which bind us. It is not for us to say that these have gone too
far.” In re

Cranston (1898) 1 I.R. 431, 446–7.

The bequest here is for research in the sciences of
philosophy and metaphysics for the ultimate good of mankind; and this is a
charitable use

wholly devoid of the element of illegality, immorality or
absurdity, even though the matter provided by the testator as the basis for the
inquiry is

utterly without scientific or other value. The general
purposes for which the trust was created are indubitably conducive to the
common interest.

The trust does not fail because it is impossible or
impracticable to carry out the particular charitable purpose. The judicial
power of cy pres

is invocable to effectuate the more general intention to
devote the property to charitable uses. The words “cy pres” are Norman French
meaning

“so near” or “as near;” and the term itself suggests the
limitations of the principle. Cy pres is “the doctrine of nearness or

#782

approximation.” MacKenzie v. Trustees of Presbytery of
Jersey City, 61 A. 1027, 1035 (N.J. 1905); Crane v. Morristown School
Foundation, 187

A. 632 (N.J. 1936). Where fulfillment of the specific
charitable intent cannot be had, equity will in the exercise of the power apply
the property

to a similar charitable purpose in accordance with the more
general charitable intent. This on the theory that the testator would have so
ordained

if he had realized that it would be impossible to carry out
the particular purpose. By this process, the intention of the testator is
fulfilled as nearly

as it is possible to do. We find nothing to indicate a
purpose to terminate the trust here if the specific intent failed of
attainment. The special

intent was but a means to an end. The particular purpose was
subordinate to the general charitable intention; and the decree constitutes a
proper

exercise of the power of cy pres. It falls within the
general charitable intention and approaches as nearly as may be the particular
purpose of the

settlor.

Even where it is possible to carry out the particular
purpose, the principle of cy pres is applicable if the fulfillment of the more
specific

intention would frustrate the general charitable intention
of the settlor. It is then “impracticable” to carry out the particular purpose.
St. James

Church v. Wilson, 89 A. 519 (N.J. Ch. 1913), affirmed on
this point sub nom. West v. Rector, etc., of St. James’ Episcopal Church, 91 A.
101

(N.J. 1914); Restatement, Trusts, section 399, Comment M.

Where the principle is applicable, Chancery will give heed,
in seeking for a charitable purpose falling within the general charitable

intention, not only to the language of the trust instrument
itself, but to all the circumstances tending to indicate the settlor’s probable
desires if he

had realized that the particular purpose could not be
carried out. This is according to the general canon of construction. In re
Fisler’s Estate, 30

A.2d 894 (N.J. 1943).

The decree is affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The materials that William B. Bamford referred to in his
will as his “Random Scientific Notes seeking the Essentials in Place and Time”
now

reside in a box that can be accessed through the rare book
room of the Princeton University Library. The notes in the box, collected in
seven spiral

binders (plus appendices), are not given the title mentioned
in the will (or any other title). It is, however, reasonably accurate to
characterize them as

“random.” The earliest material chronologically, which was
compiled in 1927 and appears in the first binder, is devoted to problems of
beach erosion on

the New Jersey coast. (See Figure 6 - 9 .) Later volumes, to
the extent they are comprehensible, build upon observations about beach
movements in an

effort to develop more fundamental physical laws governing
the universe. In the later volumes, composed toward the end of the author’s
life (he died in

1945 ), the notes are typed or scratched in pencil on the
back of various letters, advertisements, and bank statements, and include
speculations about the

```



783



```

etymology of words and other thoughts that occurred to the
author. Robert Scoon, the Stewart Professor of Philosophy at Princeton, who
reviewed the

notes and filed an affidavit in the case with his
assessment, remarked: “The author is evidently one of a class of people, that
is unfortunately well known

to University Professors, who ponder current problems in
solitude, jump to some general solution without subjecting themselves to the
disciplines of

reading the authorities or facing the criticism of other
thinkers, and then appeal to us to validate their speculations.” Renamed the
“Exton-Bamford

Fellowship Fund,” as of 2017 , the trust was being used to
support fellowships in the Philosophy Department. https://web.archive.org/ web/

2 .What are the options of the court here in response to the
request for construction of the will of William Brokaw Bamford? One, obviously,
is to

enforce paragraph ten as written, and to require that the
trust “continue and carry forward” the tenets of the Random Scientific Notes.
If Princeton

refuses to act as trustee for this purpose, then the
executor, with the court’s approval, can probably designate a substitute
trustee. Another option, as the

decision holds, is to apply cy pres and modify the purposes
of the trust created in paragraph ten so as to devote the money to something
more sensible. A

third option might be to declare that paragraph ten has
failed because of the irrationality of the Random Notes, and that therefore the
money should pass

to the other pecuniary charities named in later paragraphs
and ultimately to the second cousins under the residuary clause of the will,
paragraph thirty-

three. (Note that these residual takers apparently received
nothing, because the estate ended up with less money than the decedent
bequeathed in

paragraph ten, which has priority over the later bequests.)
If the objective is to fulfill the intentions of the donor, which of these
three options do you

think William Brokaw Bamford would have chosen if he were
still alive? If the objective is to avoid irrationality while doing minimal
violence to the

provisions of the will, which would be the preferred option?
Why might the court prefer the cy pres option rather than directing that the
money pass

under the residuary clause to the second cousins?

3 .One source of impossibility or impracticability is
changed conditions. But how much do conditions have to change for a court to
invoke cy pres?

Bryan Mullanphy set up a trust by will in 1851 , under which
the income of one-third of the estate would be used “to furnish relief to all
poor immigrants

and travelers coming to St. Louis on their way, bona fide,
to settle West.” Repeated litigation beginning in 1902 sought to have cy pres
applied because

the number of eligible beneficiaries had dropped from an
average of 1 , 500 per year in the period 1879 to 1896 , to 387 per year by
1896 , and the income

far outstripped the expenses. Not until 1934 did a court
apply cy pres. Even more dramatic is the story of the trusts set up by Benjamin
Franklin to make

start-up business loans of 60 pounds or less at 5 % to young
married artificers who had apprenticed in Boston or Philadelphia. Bonds in
Spanish milled

dollars were to be taken as security. Many aspects of the
trust quickly became outmoded, including monetary amounts not indexed for

```

```

inflation and the occupational paths taken by young people.
Courts applied the cy pres doctrine slowly and piecemeal over decades. For a
discussion of

these cases, see Lewis M. Simes, Public Policy and the Dead
Hand 127 – 31 ( 1955 ). In a recent litigation saga, Dr. Albert C. Barnes
established by his

will a foundation to operate an art museum in Merion,
Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. The Barnes Foundation argued for years
that the museum

should be allowed to relocate to Philadelphia, where it
would be visited by more people. The trust indenture also contained
restrictions on how the

works were to be displayed and forbidding them from being
loaned out. Litigation dragged on over the course of 50 years. Dr. Barnes was
considered by

some to be eccentric but he clearly did not trust the
Philadelphia art world to display his collection properly. See Ilana H.
Eisenstein, Keeping Charity in

Charitable Trust Law: The Barnes Foundation and the Case for
Consideration of Public Interest in Administration of Charitable Trusts, 151 U.
Pa. L.

Rev. 1747 ( 2003 ). In December 2004 a suburban Philadelphia
orphans’ court judge ruled that the Barnes Foundation could alter its charter
and move the

collection to Philadelphia. In Re Barnes Foundation, 24
Fiduc. Rep. 2 d 94 ( 2004 ). Further challenges by the Merion community were
unsuccessful, and

the museum completed the move to Philadelphia in 2012 , to
mixed reviews. See Allison Anna Tait, The Secret Economy of Charitable Giving,
95 B.U.

L. Rev. 1663 , 1698 n. 227 ( 2015 ) (noting that after the
move “most of the collection cannot be displayed and there are hundreds of
exhibition-quality

paintings in the vault.”).

4 .Courts in the United States long harbored great suspicion
of cy pres, stemming from abuses of related cy pres powers in England. U.S.
courts

are now more willing to apply cy pres to redirect property
in cases in which the designated charitable purposes would be unlawful,
impossible,

impracticable, or wasteful. These days the courts feel
increasingly free to select a substitute charitable purpose that is reasonably
similar to the

designated specific purpose, rather than necessarily the
nearest possible one. See Uniform Trust Code § 413 (amended 2005 ); 2
Restatement (Third) of

the Law of Trusts § 67 ( 2003 ). The new _Restatement of
Trusts_ reflects the more expansive approach to cy pres under which courts can
redirect the use of

the property not just where the designated charitable
purpose becomes unlawful, impossible, or impracticable, but also when applying
all of the property

to the original designated purpose would be wasteful. Not
surprisingly, the new _Restatement_ also would give courts freedom to select a
“charitable

purpose that reasonably approximates the designated
purpose,” rather than forcing a court to discern a general charitable intent.

5 .Although the cy pres doctrine is strictly speaking
limited to charitable trusts, problems involving changed circumstances can also
arise under

family trusts. Joseph Pulitzer, the newspaper magnate, died
in 1911 leaving his newspapers in a trust to be operated by his three sons. He
gave the sons

broad discretion to operate and dispose of the papers,
including the _St. Louis Post-Dispatch_ , except for his beloved _New York
World_ : “I particularly

enjoin upon my sons and my descendants the duty of
preserving, perfecting and perpetuating ‘The World’ newspaper (to the
maintenance and

```



785



```

upbuilding of which I have sacrificed my health and
strength) in the same spirit in which I have striven to create and conduct it
as a public institution,

from motives higher than mere gain... .” Later, in the
depths of the Great Depression, the sons petitioned the court for authority to
sell the _World_. They

showed that the paper had incurred heavy losses for five
consecutive years, and was threatening to destroy the corpus of the trust.
Without mentioning

cy pres, the court agreed to permit the sale. The court
noted that the law assumes that a settlor “had sufficient foresight to realize
that securities

bequeathed to a trustee may become so unproductive or so
diminished in value as to authorize their sale where extraordinary
circumstances develop or a

crisis occurs. Such was the law in this state prior to the
making of Mr. Pulitzer’s Will. He is charged with knowledge of it.” In re
Pulitzer’s Estate, 249

N.Y.S. 87 , 93 (Sur. Ct. 1931 ). Ironically, although the
_World_ disappeared nineteen years after his death, the _Post-Dispatch_ , which
Pulitzer “had several

times tried to sell and to which he devoted much less
attention,” survives to this day. W.A. Swanberg, Pulitzer 417 – 18 ( 1967 ).

6 .Many trusts from earlier eras have provisions that
discriminate on the basis of race, gender, or religion. Courts have often used
cy pres to

remove restrictions from gifts to schools for scholarships
and other educational purposes. See, e.g., Trammell v. Elliott, 199 S.E. 2 d
194 (Ga. 1973 )

(applying cy pres to remove whites-only restriction from
scholarship fund); Coffee v. William Marsh Rice University, 408 S.W. 2 d 269
(Tex. Civ. App.

1966 ) (using cy pres to remove racial restriction from
organic instruments by which university was created); but cf. Trustees of
University of Delaware

v. Gebelein, 420 A. 2 d 1191 (Del. Ch. 1980 ) (holding
administration of women-only scholarship by state university to be state action
but that remedial

purpose of scholarship made discrimination permissible).
Recall from Chapter IV that the U.S. Supreme Court has had difficulty
articulating the

boundaries of state action where courts give effect to
claims of one private party against another. What if a court is asked to
appoint trustees to a

discriminatory trust? Courts are split over whether
appointing private trustees is state action. Compare In re Wilson, 452 N.E. 2 d
1228 (N.Y. 1983 ) (no)

with In re Certain Scholarship Funds, 575 A. 2 d 1325 (N.H.
1990 ) (yes).

7 .Although trusts are important in family wealth
settlements and in transmitting property on death, they are also very important
in commercial

contexts. For example, trusts are commonly used in the
administration of pension plans, and are used in creating separate entities to
receive periodic

payments like receivables or mortgage payments that can be
“securitized” and sold on secondary securities markets. Overall, it has been
estimated that

90 % of all assets held in trust are held for commercial,
rather than family, purposes. See John H. Langbein, The Secret Life of the
Trust: The Trust as an

Instrument of Commerce, 107 Yale L.J. 165 , 177 – 78 ( 1997
).

### 2 .CORPORATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS

Corporations and partnerships are even more important than
trusts as devices for separating the management and beneficial enjoyment of

assets. You will very likely take an entire course in
business associations, and we have no desire to duplicate such a course here,
even in part. The

#786

point of bringing up corporations and partnerships is simply
to highlight that they too serve as entity property devices for separating
management

authority from other attributes of ownership, allowing large
complexes of property to be effectively managed in ways that would be difficult
if

not impossible to achieve using only the common-law forms of
property ownership. Placing ownership of property in a corporation or

partnership is in effect an alternative to the lease, the
condominium, or the trust as a mechanism for achieving integrated management of
large

complexes of assets.

The distinctive feature of corporations and partnerships,
from a property rights perspective, is that an artificial entity is permitted
to own

property in its own name and right, as if it were a person.
Thus, the assets of the corporation or the partnership are treated as separate
and distinct

from the assets of the owners or partners who form these
entities. The corporation achieves this outcome by adopting a two-level
ownership

structure. The shareholders own the corporation. The
corporation, in turn, holds title to various assets, including real and
personal property,

intangible property including intellectual property rights,
and contract rights. The ownership interest of the shareholders gives them the
right to

receive dividends as periodically declared by the board of
directors, and to a pro rata share of the assets upon dissolution of the
corporation.

Otherwise, the shareholders play only an episodic role in
the management of the corporation and its assets. They elect a board of
directors, and

also vote on important amendments to the bylaws of the
corporation and important corporate control transactions like mergers. But the
day-to-

day management and control of the various assets owned by
the corporation is vested in the managers of the corporation, appointed by the

directors. Thus, the various incidents of ownership we have
studied—including the rights to exclude, to license, to destroy, and to
transfer—are

exercised by a large number of managers and employees, all
acting in the name of the corporation. This separation of ownership and control
has

been familiar in corporate law since Berle and Means
initially posed it as a problem. Adolf A. Berle & Gardiner C. Means, The
Modern

Corporation and Private Property 4–7 (1932). Their insight
served as the starting point for the agency-cost theory of the firm. Berle and
Means

regarded separation of ownership and control as a challenge
to traditional notions of property. But this separation of ownership and
control can

also be viewed as the way in which the exclusionary and
governance strategies traditionally associated with property are accommodated
to the

complexities of modern business organizations. Indeed, there
is an increasing awareness that the problem of defining entity property raises

property-like questions of boundary placement and the
information costs implicated by in rem effects. See, e.g., John Armour &
Michael J.

Whincop, The Proprietary Foundations of Corporate Law, 27
Oxford J. Legal Stud. 429 (2007); Edward M. Iacobucci & George G. Triantis,

Economic and Legal Boundaries of Firms, 93 Va. L. Rev. 515

#787

(2007); Joshua Getzler, Plural Ownership, Funds, and the
Aggregation of Wills, 10 Theoretical Inquiries L. 241 (2009).

The relationships among the managers and employees are
governed largely by contract (including the bylaws of the corporation and

employment contracts). Hence corporations are often
described as a “nexus of contracts.” See, e.g., Frank Easterbrook & Daniel
Fischel, The

Economic Structure of Corporate Law 24–25 (1991); Michael C.
Jensen & William H. Meckling, The Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior,

Agency Costs, and Ownership Structure, 3 J. Fin. Econ. 305
(1976). But what gives the contracts a “nexus” is the understanding that the

corporation as an entity owns the assets of the enterprise,
and that the corporation as an entity is in turn owned by the shareholders. See
Melvin

A. Eisenberg, The Conception That the Corporation is a Nexus
of Contracts, and the Dual Nature of the Firm, 24 J. Corp. L. 819 (1999); Henry

E. Smith, Property as Platform: Coordinating Standards for
Technological Innovation, 9 J. Competition L. & Econ. 1057, 1064–70 (2013).

For partnerships, the matter is more complicated, although
practically speaking the result today is the same: entity ownership. It was not

always so. Traditionally the formation of a partnership gave
rise to ownership of the assets by tenancy in partnership. This operated
something

like a tenancy in common. Each partner was a direct owner of
the assets (along with the other partners) and was entitled to a proportionate
share

of the earnings. Governance of the assets was by consent or
by partnership agreement. Today, partnerships are everywhere regarded as having
a

two-level ownership structure, analogous to corporations.
The partners own the partnership conceived of as an entity, and the
partnership, as an

entity, owns the underlying assets. This was achieved
indirectly by the Uniform Partnership Act, which defined a partnership as an
association of

co-owners, but then proceeded to give the partnership most
of the attributes of ownership. See Uniform Partnership Act (1914). The Revised

Uniform Partnership Act embraces this conclusion directly,
providing in that “[a] partnership is an entity.” Revised Uniform Partnership
Act

§ 201 (1997).

What are the implications of recognizing corporations and
partnerships as entities with ownership rights distinct from the rights of the

shareholders and partners that own these entities? Henry
Hansmann and Reinier Kraakman have argued that one very important implication
is

that corporations and partnerships are shielded from claims
of creditors of the individual shareholders or partners. The entity itself is
not liable

for the personal debts of its owners. Thus, if shareholder A
fails to pay his debts, A’s creditors cannot come after the corporation’s
factory. Henry

Hansmann & Reinier Kraakman, The Essential Role of
Organizational Law, 110 Yale L.J. 387 (2000). Moreover, Hansmann and Kraakman

argue that this aspect of the law of business organizations
cannot be created by contract, because it would be prohibitively costly to

#788

do so; it must be authorized legislatively, and hence can be
called a rule of property.

Another implication of the entity-ownership feature of
corporations and partnerships is that it permits the specialization of
functions we

have emphasized throughout the chapter. By placing ownership
of assets in an artificial legal entity like a corporation or a partnership,
assets can

be subjected to a sophisticated governance regime defined by
the nexus of contracts that make up the legal entity. Thus, just as the trust
permits a

specialization of functions between the trustee as manager
of assets and the beneficiaries as recipients of earnings, so corporations and

partnerships permit a similar division. The officers and
employees of the entity serve as the specialized managers of a complex of
assets. The

benefits of this asset management—typically in the form of
profits earned—are then distributed among stakeholders, most prominently
through

dividends paid to shareholders or shares of earnings
distributed to partners, in accordance with corporate and partnership law and
contractual

understandings established for these purposes within the
entity. (Entity law also provides for the distribution of the entity assets
upon dissolution

of the entity.) This specialization of functions permits
larger and more complicated collections of assets to be managed effectively
than would be

possible if the only tools available were the common-law
forms of property surveyed in Chapter V.

Also, as in the case of the trust, the corporation raises
difficult problems about how to manage the managers. Like the trustees of a
trust, the

directors and officers of a corporation are subject to a
variety of fiduciary duties. In particular, directors and officers are subject
to a duty of

loyalty to the corporation. This means, among other things,
that they may not seek to benefit personally from business opportunities that
by right

belong to the corporation, nor may they take actions for
their personal benefit that disadvantage the corporation. These doctrines apply
to the

management and acquisition of property by the corporation.
See, e.g., Northeast Harbor Golf Club, Inc. v. Harris, 725 A.2d 1018 (Me. 1999)

(president of golf course breached fiduciary duty by
acquiring in her own name property surrounding the golf course for
development). There is,

needless to say, an enormous literature on whether the
constraints corporate agents face are adequate. The constraints come from a
variety of

sources. The federal Securities and Exchange Commission
regulates activities related to the issuance and transfer of corporate
securities.

Corporation law imposes various fiduciary duties on
corporate directors and officers, and state courts entertain suits by
shareholders for alleged

violations of these duties. And the market provides a
significant constraint, in that individual shareholders who do not approve of
the conduct of

the managers can sell their shares, and hence “exit” from
the corporation at relatively low cost. If more shareholders exit than enter,
the price of

the stock falls, which may

#789

attract the attention of the board of directors or can even
lead to a takeover of the corporation in order to replace the managers.

Note that business organizations come in a set list of forms
somewhat reminiscent of the numerus clausus of forms of ownership. In

addition to the sole proprietorship—where an individual owns
the business assets in fee simple or absolute ownership—the principal options
are

the business corporation and the partnership. But there are
variations, which have been expanding in number. For example, in a conventional

partnership, the individual partners are liable for the
debts of the partnership as an entity, in contrast to the corporation, where
the shareholders

have no liability for the debts of the corporation beyond
the value of their shares. But recently, many states have recognized limited
liability

partnerships, which are like regular partnerships with the
added feature of limited liability for the individual partners. This is why
many law

firms now sport the designation “LLP” after their name.

(^3) There was evidence that the lounge had amplified music
(electric musical instruments and singing, at various times) which started at 9
: 30 P.M. and continued until 1 : 30 A.M. or 2

A.M., generally on Tuesdays through Sundays. The music could
be heard through the granite walls of the residential tenants’ building, and
was described variously as unbelievably loud,

incessant, raucous, and penetrating. The noise interfered
with conversation and prevented sleep. There was also evidence of noise from
patrons’ yelling and fighting.

(^4) The general, but not universal, rule, in this country
is that a landlord is not chargeable because one tenant is causing annoyance to
another (A. H. Woods Theatre v. North American

Union, 246 Ill.App. 521 , 526 – 527 ( 1927 ) (music from one
commercial tenant annoying another commercial tenant’s employees)), even where
the annoying conduct would be a breach of the

landlord’s covenant of quiet enjoyment if the landlord were
the miscreant. Contra Kesner v. Consumers Co., 255 Ill.App. 216 , 228 – 229 (
1929 ) (storage of flammables constituting a nuisance);

Bruckner v. Helfaer, 222 N.W. 790 , 791 (Wis. 1929 )
(residential tenant not liable for rent where landlord, with ample notice, does
not control another tenant’s conduct).

The rule in New York appears to be that the landlord may not
recover rent if he has had ample notice of the existence of conduct of one
tenant which deprives another tenant of the

beneficial enjoyment of his premises and the landlord does
little or nothing to abate the nuisance. See Cohen v. Werner, 378 N.Y.S. 2 d
868 (N.Y. App. T. 1975 ); Rockrose Associates v. Peters,

366 N.Y.S. 2 d 567 , 568 (N.Y. Civ. Ct. 1975 ) (office
lease); Home Life Ins. Co. v. Breslerman, 5 N.Y.S. 2 d 272 , 273 (N.Y. App. T.
1938 ). But see comments in Trustees of the Sailors’ Snug

Harbor in the City of New York v. Sugarman, 35 N.Y.S. 2 d
196 , 197 – 98 (N.Y. App. Div. 1942 ) (no nuisance).

A tenant with sufficient bargaining power may be able to
obtain an agreement from the landlord to insert and to enforce regulatory
restrictions in the leases of other, potentially

offending, tenants. See E. Schwartz, Lease Drafting in
Massachusetts § 6. 33 ( 1961 ).

(^11) E.g., Medico-Dental Building Co. v. Horton &
Converse, 132 P. 2 d 457 , 462 (Cal. 1942 ).

(^12) Kessler, The Protection of the Consumer Under Modern
Sales Law, 74 Yale L.J. 262 , 263 ( 1964 ).

(^30) The rule was “settled” by 1485. 3 W. Holdsworth, A
History of English Law 122 – 123 ( 6 th ed. 1934 ). The common law rule
discussed in text originated in the even older rule

prohibiting the tenant from committing waste. The writ of
waste expanded as the tenant’s right to possession grew stronger. Eventually,
in order to protect the landowner’s reversionary

interest, the tenant became obligated to make repairs and
liable to eviction and damages if he failed to do so. Ibid.

(^31) The land was so central to the original common law
conception of a leasehold that rent was viewed as “issuing” from the land: “The
governing idea is that the land is bound to pay the

rent * * *. We may almost go to the length of saying that
the land pays it through (the tenant’s) hand.” 2 F. Pollock & F. Maitland,
The History of English Law 131 ( 2 d ed. 1923 ).

(^33) Even the old common law courts responded with a
different rule for a landlord-tenant relationship which did not conform to the
model of the usual agrarian lease. Much more

substantial obligations were placed upon the keepers of inns
(the only multiple dwelling houses known to the common law). Their guests were
interested solely in shelter and could not be

expected to make their own repairs. “The modern apartment
dweller more closely resembles the guest in an inn than he resembles an
agrarian tenant, but the law has not generally recognized

the similarity.” J. Levi, P. Hablutzel, L. Rosenberg &
J. White, Model Residential Landlord-Tenant Code 6 – 7 (Tent. Draft 1969 ).

(^34) Paradine v. Jane, Aleyn 26 , 82 Eng.Rep. 897 (K.B.
1647 ) * * *

(^37) Ingalls v. Hobbs, 31 N.E. 286 (Mass. 1892 ).

(^49) We need not consider the provisions of the written
lease governing repairs since this implied warranty of the landlord could not
be excluded.

(^53) “No person shall rent or offer to rent any habitation,
or the furnishings thereof, unless such habitation and its furnishings are in a
clean, safe and sanitary condition, in repair, and free

from rodents or vermin.”

(^61) In extending all contract remedies for breach to the
parties to a lease, we include an action for specific performance of the
landlord’s implied warranty of habitability.

(^62) To be relevant, of course, the violations must affect
the tenant’s apartment or common areas which the tenant uses. Moreover, the
contract principle that no one may benefit from his

own wrong will allow the landlord to defend by proving the
damage was caused by the tenant’s wrongful action. However, violations
resulting from inadequate repairs or materials which

disintegrate under normal use would not be assignable to the
tenant. Also we agree with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals that the
tenant’s private rights do not depend on official

inspection or official finding of violation by the city
government. Diamond Housing Corp. v. Robinson, 257 A. 2 d 492 , 494 (D.C. App.
1969 ).

(^63) The jury should be instructed that one or two minor
violations standing alone which do not affect habitability are de minimis and
would not entitle the tenant to a reduction in rent.

(^64) As soon as the landlord made the necessary repairs
rent would again become due. Our holding, of course, affects only eviction for
nonpayment of rent. The landlord is free to seek

eviction at the termination of the lease or on any other
legal ground.

(^67) Appellants in the present cases offered to pay rent
into the registry of the court during the present action. We think this is an
excellent protective procedure. If the tenant defends

against an action for possession on the basis of breach of
the landlord’s warranty of habitability, the trial court may require the tenant
to make future rent payments into the registry of the

court as they become due; such a procedure would be
appropriate only while the tenant remains in possession. The escrowed money
will, however, represent rent for the period between the

time the landlord files suit and the time the case comes to
trial. In the normal course of litigation, the only factual question at trial
would be the condition of the apartment during the time the

landlord alleged rent was due and not paid.

As a general rule, the escrowed money should be apportioned
between the landlord and the tenant after trial on the basis of the finding of
rent actually due for the period at issue in the

suit. To insure fair apportionment, however, we think either
party should be permitted to amend its complaint or answer at any time before
trial, to allege a change in the condition of the

apartment. In this event, the finder of fact should make a
separate finding as to the condition of the apartment at the time at which the
amendment was filed. This new finding will have no

effect upon the original action; it will only affect the
distribution of the escrowed rent paid after the filing of the amendment.

(^1) Among other provisions, the lease prohibited the tenant
from assigning or transferring the lease without the consent of the landlord.
If the tenant defaulted, the lease gave the landlord

the option of re-entering or re-letting, but stipulated that
failure to re-let or to recover the full rental would not discharge the
tenant’s liability for rent.

(^3) It is well settled that a party claiming damages for a
breach of contract has a duty to mitigate his loss.

(^4) We see no distinction between the leases involved in
the instant appeals and those which might arise in other types of residential
housing. However, we reserve for another day the

question of whether a landlord must mitigate damages in a
commercial setting.

(^5) * * * Because we hold that plaintiff breached his duty
to attempt to mitigate damages, we do not address defendant’s argument that the
landlord accepted a surrender of the premises.

(^1) In _Rodruck,_ the court held a promise to pay
assessments for maintenance to be a running covenant. It distinguished that
covenant from one which provided for the payment of dues to a

property owners association but did not specify how the
money was to be spent.

(^2) This proposition is supported by the weight of
authority from other jurisdictions. Almost all courts that have considered the
question have held that a promise to return a security

deposit does not run with the land. See Federated Mortgage
Investors v. American S & L Ass’n, 121 Cal.Rptr. 137 (Cal. App. 1975 );
McDonald’s Corp. v. Blotnik, 328 N.E. 2 d 897 (Ill. App.

1975 ); Mauro v. Alvino, 152 N.Y.S. 963 (Sup. Ct. App. T.
1915 ); Partington v. Miller, 5 A. 2 d 468 (N.J. 1939 ); Tuteur v. P. & F.
Enterprises, Inc., 255 N.E. 2 d 284 (Ohio App. 1970 ).

(^1) We are presented only with a commercial lease and
therefore do not address the question whether residential leases are controlled
by the principles articulated in this opinion.

(^2) Since the present case involves an assignment rather
than a sublease, we will speak primarily in terms of assignments. However, our
holding applies equally to subleases. * * *

(^5) Paragraph 13 of the sublease between the Perlitches and
Bixler provides: “Lessee shall not assign this lease, or any interest therein,
and shall not sublet the said premises or any part

thereof, or any right or privilege appurtenant thereto, or
suffer any other person (the agents and servants of Lessee excepted) to occupy
or use said premises, or any portion thereof, without

written consent of Lessor first had and obtained, and a
consent to one assignment, subletting, occupation or use by any other person,
shall not be deemed to be a consent to any subsequent

assignment, subletting, occupation or use by another person.
Any such assignment or subletting without this consent shall be void, and
shall, at the option of Lessor, terminate this lease. This

lease shall not, nor shall any interest therein, be
assignable, as to the interest of lessee, by operation of alaw [ _sic_ ],
without the written consent of Lessor.”

(^15) Some commentators have drawn an analogy between this
situation and the duties of good faith and reasonableness implied in all
transactions under the Uniform Commercial Code.

(U.Com.Code §§ 1 – 203 , 2 – 103 (b); see also U.Com.Code §
1 – 102 , com. 1 [permitting application of the U.Com.Code to matters not
expressly within its scope].) See Comment, The Approval

Clause in a Lease: Toward a Standard of Reasonableness, [ 17
U.S.F.L.Rev. 681 , 695 ( 1983 )]; see also Levin, Withholding Consent to
Assignment: The Changing Rights of the Commercial

Landlord, 30 De Paul L.Rev. 109 , 136 ( 1980 ).

(^17) Amicus Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro request that we
make clear that, “whatever principle governs in the absence of express lease
provisions, nothing bars the parties to commercial

lease transactions from making their own arrangements
respecting the allocation of appreciated rentals if there is a transfer of the
leasehold.” This principle we affirm; we merely hold that the

clause in the instant lease established no such arrangement.

(^1) The declaration is the operative document for a common
interest development, setting forth, among other things, the restrictions on
the use or enjoyment of any portion of the

development. (Civ.Code, §§ 1351 , 1353 .) In some states,
the declaration is also referred to as the “master deed.” (See Dulaney Towers
Maintenance v. O’Brey, 418 A. 2 d 1233 , 1235 (Md.

App. 1980 ).)

(^2) Under Civil Code section 1354 , subdivision (a) such
use restrictions are “enforceable equitable servitudes, unless unreasonable.”

(^3) The CC & R’s permit residents to keep “domestic
fish and birds.”

(^9) Section 1354 also confers standing on owners of
separate interests in a development and on the association to enforce the
equitable servitudes, and it sets out requirements for

commencing a civil action.

(^1) Initially, defendant sought changes in the building
services, such as the installation of video surveillance, 24 - hour door
service and replacement of the lobby mailboxes. After

investigation, the Board deemed these proposed changes
inadvisable or infeasible.

resulted in the professor’s arrest. Eventually, the charges were adjourned in
contemplation of dismissal.

(^5) RPAPL 711 ( 1 ), in pertinent part, states: “A
proceeding seeking to recover possession of real property by reason of the
termination of the term fixed in the lease pursuant to a provision

contained therein giving the landlord the right to terminate
the time fixed for occupancy under such agreement if he deem the tenant
objectionable, shall not be maintainable unless the

landlord shall by competent evidence establish to the
satisfaction of the court that the tenant is objectionable.”

(^2) In New York, an executor, as such, takes a qualified
legal title to all personalty specifically bequeathed and an unqualified legal
title to that not so bequeathed; he holds not in his own

right but as a trustee for the benefit of creditors, those
entitled to receive under the will and, if all is not bequeathed, those
entitled to distribution under the EPTL (Blood v. Kane, 29 N.E. 994 ,

## CHAPTER VII

# SECURITY INTERESTS

### A. INTRODUCTION

One of the most important attributes of property, from both
an economic and legal point of view, is its role in facilitating the flow of

investment capital by providing a form of security for
loans. Nearly all purchases of real property are made with borrowed money using
the

purchased property as security for the loan; most purchases
of vehicles and other types of expensive personal property are also financed
with

security taken in the acquired property. In addition, owners
of businesses, large and small, frequently borrow money to expand or improve
their

operations using existing, purchased, or after-acquired
property as security. Secured lending has also been proclaimed as the key to
greater and

more equitably distributed economic growth in developing
countries. Most prominently, Hernando de Soto has argued that if informal
property

rights of urban squatters and rural peasants were
formalized, this would allow them to use these rights as collateral for secured
loans, which

could then be used to finance small start-up businesses. See
Hernando de Soto, The Mystery of Capital (2000). Secured lending, on this view,
is

the secret of economic development in the West, and if
emulated elsewhere could have a transformative effect on world poverty.
Although these

views have been contested and exuberant mortgage lending in
the United States produced a major recession in 2007–08, there is no doubt that

secured lending is a central feature of mature economic
systems, and a core contribution that private property makes to those systems.

The use of collateral is probably the most well-known
mechanism for enhancing the likelihood that a borrower will perform as agreed
in a

credit transaction. Because a grant of collateral makes the
likelihood of performance more secure, such a transaction commonly is referred
to as a

secured transaction. [I begin] with a discussion of four
basic topics about such a transaction: (1) what it means for a lender to
receive a grant of

collateral, (2) why a lender would want to do so, (3) the
source of the legal rules that govern those transactions, and (4) the extent to
which

parties are free to contract around them.

#792

A.What Is a Security Interest?

The first task for the student of secured transactions is to
understand what it means for a borrower to grant collateral to a lender.
Although

the reference to a “grant[ing]” of collateral might suggest
that the borrower identifies some particular item of property and conveys it to
the

lender, that is not the case. On the contrary, the borrower
simply grants to the lender a right against the asset in question. The asset in
question is

usually referred to as the “collateral” because the lender’s
right against the asset provides a secondary or collateral source of repayment
for the

lender. Traditionally, the lender’s right against the
collateral has been described as a “lien.”

Although the term “lien” continues to be common in
transactions involving real estate, the states and Congress, through the UCC
and the

Bankruptcy Code, respectively, have adopted the term
“security interest,” reflecting the notion that the lender receives an interest
in a particular

asset to make the transaction more secure. See, e.g., UCC §
9–109(a)(1) (stating that UCC Article 9 applies to “a[ny] transaction,
regardless of

its form, that creates a security interest in personal
property or fixtures by contract”); Bankruptcy Code § 101(51) (“[S]ecurity
interest means lien

created by an agreement.”). * * *

The main continuing distinction between the terms lien and
security interest relates to the voluntariness of the transaction. The term

“security interest” is limited to transactions in which the
borrower voluntarily grants an interest in particular property. See Bankruptcy
Code

§ 1 01(51) (“[S]ecurity interest means lien created by an
agreement .”). Thus, a borrower normally grants a security interest in personal
property

by executing a document called a “security agreement.” See
UCC § 9–102(a)(73) (defining “security agreement”). For real property, the

document normally is called a mortgage or a deed of trust.
See, e.g. , Restatement of Mortgages § 4.1 (“A mortgage creates a security
interest in

real estate.”). From the term “mortgage” come the common
terms mortgagor (the borrower or debtor that grants the mortgage) and mortgagee

(the lender, creditor, or secured party to whom the mortgage
is granted).

In many contexts, however, statutes provide for the
automatic creation of a lien without the consent of the borrower. For example,
if a

defendant does not voluntarily comply with a monetary
judgment issued by a court, the plaintiff generally can obtain a “judgment
lien” or a

“judicial lien” to force the defendant to comply. Similarly,
if a contractor provides services or materials for the construction of a
building but the

owner fails to pay for those services or materials, the
contractor can obtain a “mechanic’s lien” against the building. * * *

The most important concept in the law of secured
transactions is the nature of the security interest. In substance, the security
interest (or

lien) is a relation between a debt and an asset that
entitles the holder of the debt to certain rights with respect to the asset.
Notice that the

definition

#793

ties the security interest to a particular debt rather than
a particular lender. Thus, if the debt is transferred from one lender to
another, the security

interest generally follows automatically to the new lender.
In the common parlance, “the lien follows the debt.”

Although the details of the relation created by a security
interest are quite complicated * * * , the basic idea is a simple one. In
substance,

the borrower agrees that the lender has a group of special
remedial rights against the collateral, such as a speedier remedy (a right to
nonjudicial

repossession, for example), a right to sell the collateral
to satisfy the debt, or a priority in the proceeds of the asset if the borrower
should become

bankrupt. In some cases, the lender might take possession of
the collateral (think of the pawn shop operator), but ordinarily the borrower
retains

possession of the collateral during the term of the loan.

The lender’s rights against the collateral continue until
(and only until) the debt has been repaid. Once the debt is repaid, the
security

interest terminates entirely, even if the borrower
previously has defaulted. Although that sounds like a common-sense proposition,
it has several

significant consequences. The first is commonly known as the
borrower’s “equity of redemption.” Suppose that a borrower promises to repay a

debt in equal monthly installments over a period of two
years, but fails to make the first six payments. If the borrower at that point
tenders to the

lender the entire amount owing on the debt, the borrower is
said to “redeem” the collateral (hence the term “equity of redemption”). At
that point,

the security interest is completely discharged from the
collateral, even though the borrower failed to comply with its obligations in a
timely

manner. It may be that the total due from the borrower is
considerably larger than the amount originally borrowed (because of interest,
late

charges, or the like), but it is fundamental to the secured
transaction that the security interest is discharged if the borrower pays that
total amount

at any point before the lender has sold the collateral to
satisfy the debt. Traditionally, it is only at that point—when the lender has
sold the

collateral—that the borrower is “foreclosed” from
“redeeming” the collateral; hence the classic term “foreclosure” for the
lender’s sale.

An important corollary of the equity of redemption is the
single-repayment rule. That rule generally prohibits the creditor from
retaining

funds or assets with a value that exceeds the outstanding
balance of the debt. Thus, if the lender sells the collateral at foreclosure,
the lender

cannot retain any funds that exceed the outstanding balance
of the debt at that time (including, of course, previously accrued interest as
well as

appropriate costs and fees). The idea is that once the
balance paid to the lender equals the total outstanding debt, the lien is
discharged and the

lender thus can have no interest in any excess funds.

B.Why Take a Security Interest?

To understand the dynamics of secured transactions in
practice, it is important to understand precisely why borrowers and lenders use

#794

secured transactions rather than guaranties or simple
unsecured transactions. One obvious answer is that the grant of collateral
increases the

likelihood of payment by enhancing the ability of the lender
to obtain repayment through forced sale of the collateral. If there is a
default or the

borrower files for bankruptcy, the lender knows that it will
be entitled to its collateral, or at a minimum (in bankruptcy) to the value of
the

collateral as of the time of the bankruptcy. That result is
quite different from the rights of the typical unsecured creditor, who has no
claim on any

particular asset and thus tends to receive little or nothing
in a bankruptcy of its borrower.

From that perspective, the collateral essentially functions
by allowing the borrower to precommit to sure payment. That precommitment, in

turn, should lower the interest rates that the lender needs
to charge for its business to be profitable. That perspective underlies all the
doctrinal

legal rules developed to govern secured transactions, which
generally operate on the view that the lender’s direct legal rights of
enforcement

against the collateral is the central feature of secured
transactions. Hence, the legal rules tend to assume that any enhancement of the
lender’s

enforcement rights increases the efficacy of the
transactions by enhancing the likelihood of payment and thus lowering the
up-front cost of credit.

Although there is a kernel of truth to that basic
law-centered perspective, the reality of secured transactions suggests that a
complete picture

must take account of a set of more indirect and complicated
motivations for the use of collateral. For one thing, in most contexts
(especially in

business-related transactions) it is quite uncommon—even in
cases of default—for a lender to repossess a borrower’s collateral or conduct a

foreclosure sale to obtain payment of the debt. Furthermore,
the remedy of foreclosure is a most ineffective way to obtain payment: When

lenders do conduct foreclosure sales, they rarely succeed in
obtaining full payment of their debts. For example, statistics on commercial
real-

estate loans (the area in which the best statistics are
available) suggest that a typical foreclosure sale results in a loss to the
lender of about 40%

of its original loan amount.

Thus, it is important as you study the relevant legal rules
to consider the various other indirect effects of the use of collateral in
lending

transactions. For present purposes, two of those effects
warrant attention. The simplest arises from the leverage that the transaction
gives to the

lender. * * * [I]t is an unfortunate fact that the
foreclosure process typically destroys considerable value. That is true because
the price at which

an asset is sold at an involuntary foreclosure sale held by
the lender generally will be lower than the asset’s value to the borrower. The
asset

might have some particular idiosyncratic value to the
borrower; it might be a generations-old family farm, for example. Or, it might
just be worth

more to the borrower because of the borrower’s

#795

dependence on it; think of the losses a borrower might
suffer if it lost a small machine crucial to its production process.

But whatever the reason, borrowers understand that
foreclosure will be a costly process that will not just take an asset from
them; the

process will dispose of the asset at a low cost, typically
leaving the borrower liable for the remaining balance of the debt. Thus, the
prospect of

the destructive losses that result from a foreclosure can
give the borrower an incentive far beyond a simple precommitment to payment.
From the

lender’s perspective, that incentive helps to diminish the
chances that the borrower will engage in the kinds of risky conduct that might
limit the

borrower’s ability to repay the loan as agreed.

The use of secured transactions also works indirectly to
solve a lender’s concerns about excessive borrowing by its clients. For a
variety of

reasons starting with a desire for its clients to operate
prudently, lenders typically worry that their clients will borrow excessively
in the future

and thus increase the risk of nonpayment of the loans that
the first lender already has made. The earlier lender could (and often does)
try to solve

the problem by extracting a promise from its borrower that
it will refrain from future borrowing (a negative-debt covenant). As a general
matter,

however, negative-debt covenants are quite ineffective,
especially for smaller borrowers. For one thing, those covenants affect future
lenders

only if they know about them, and borrowers may have little
incentive to tell prospective lenders about restrictions imposed by their prior

lenders. More seriously, the negative-debt covenant
generally can be enforced only against the borrower, not against future
lenders. Thus, if a

future lender makes a loan to the borrower without knowledge
of the covenant of the earlier lender, the borrower will remain obligated to
repay

the new loan even if the new loan violated the negative-debt
covenant that the borrower previously made to the earlier lender.

The public notice of a secured transaction indirectly helps
to solve that problem. As you will see later, in most secured transactions, the

secured creditor obtains its position only by placing a
notice of the transaction in the appropriate public records (usually a
“financing statement”

for personal-property transactions, a “mortgage” for
real-property transactions). Because future lenders are likely to discover that
notice, those

future lenders are likely to learn of the bank’s position,
which significantly diminishes the ability of the borrower to obtain excessive
debt. In

many contexts, that indirect effect of the security
interest—to limit future borrowing—is much more important to the transaction
than any of the

other effects described earlier.

C.What Law Governs Security Interests?

In the context of real-estate transactions, the law of
security interests (known as the law of mortgages) has had a long and checkered
history,

with a strong tradition of forceful judicial development,
but relatively limited statutory involvement other than codifications of the
rules for

foreclosure sales. Indeed, efforts to codify uniform rules
for real-

#796

estate security interests have been notably unsuccessful.
Most obviously, not a single jurisdiction chose to enact either the Uniform
Land Security

Interest Act (the “ULSIA”), which the National Conference of
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (“NCCUSL”) promulgated in 1985, or the

Uniform Nonjudicial Foreclosure Act, promulgated in 2002.

Thus, the law of mortgages exists in a series of common law
rules. As with all common law rules, there are differences between states. For

the most part, however, the basic concepts are relatively
uniform throughout American jurisdictions. Accordingly, after the failure of
the ULSIA,

the American Law Institute (the “ALI”) pressed forward in
the 1990’s with a project to develop what is now known as the Restatement of

Mortgages. (The official title is the Restatement of the Law
Third: Property: Mortgages.) Adopted in 1997, the Restatement of Mortgages

provides a useful and up-to-date explication of the
principal rules of real estate security interests. * * *

The story is quite different for personal property security
interests. In that area, there has been a strong tradition of statutory
codification.

During the first part of this century, the law in the area
was divided into a wide variety of difficult-to-reconcile areas, ranging from
chattel

mortgages, to pledges, to field warehousing, to rarer
devices such as the redoubtable hypothec (a predecessor to the security
interest common in

the civil law in Louisiana). In an effort to encourage
commerce by bringing sense to the area, the ALI and NCCUSL included in the
first version

of the UCC an article dealing specifically with personal
property security interests, Article 9; the reporter was the famous Yale
professor Grant

Gilmore.

All things considered, Article 9 generally is thought to be
one of the most successful of the original articles of the UCC. Nevertheless,
the

pressures of changing commercial practices have forced
periodic revisions. Most recently, in 1998 the ALI adopted a completely
rewritten

version of Article 9. Although it made important substantive
changes in a number of areas, the core policy decisions implicit in the
original

statute remained untouched.

D.Mandatory and Default Rules

Much of commercial law consists of a set of background or
default rules that apply only when parties fail to address the topics in their

contracts. Thus, for example, UCC Article 2 establishes a
complex framework of rules regarding the responsibility a buyer and seller bear
for

loss or damage of property during the various stages of a
sales transaction. But many of those rules apply only in the absence of a
contrary

contract. If the parties decide in their contract to adopt a
contrary rule—the buyer bears all risk of loss starting at the moment of
contract—then

that rule ordinarily would apply notwithstanding the more
buyer-favorable rule in the UCC.

#797

By contrast, the most fundamental precepts of the law of
security interests are mandatory rules that apply notwithstanding any contrary

contractual determinations of the parties. In particular,
whenever parties enter into a transaction that involves a security interest or
lien, the law

will recast the relationship as necessary to ensure two
things discussed above:

(1)If the borrower pays the entire amount secured by the
collateral at any time before foreclosure, the security interest is discharged

entirely, notwithstanding any prior default.

(2)If the lender takes the collateral in satisfaction of the
debt, the lender almost invariably is obligated to conduct some type of
foreclosure

sale to determine the value of the property. That right to
force a foreclosure is designed to ensure that the lender does not retain the
collateral

when its value exceeds the balance owed on the debt.

Those rules have a distinguished tradition, stemming from
the English prohibitions on “clogging the equity of redemption.” That phrase

reflects the traditional description of the borrower’s right
to pay the debt at any time—that is, the right to pay after the due date—as the
“equity

of redemption.” In the archaic parlance, a contractual
provision limiting that right improperly “clogs” the equity of redemption, and
thus is

invalid.

Although the mandatory character of those concepts has an
ancient lineage, their importance continues in modern transactions, as
evidenced

by their appearance in both the UCC and the Restatement. See
UCC § 9–109(a)(1) (“[T]his article applies to a[ny] transaction, regardless of
its

form, that creates a security interest in personal property
or fixtures by contract.”); Restatement of Mortgages § 3 .1(b) (“Any agreement
in or

created contemporaneously with a mortgage that impairs the
mortgagor’s [equity of redemption] is ineffective.”). * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Security interests can be seen as another form of divided
ownership. Typically, the borrower holds a fee simple (or absolute title) and
enjoys all

rights associated with possession, including the right to
exclude others. These rights are subject to the security interest, which is a
nonpossessory interest

that ripens into a possessory interest under certain
conditions, namely, nonrepayment of the loan. In terms of the forms of property
considered in

Chapters V and VI, perhaps the closest analogue is a fee
simple subject to an executory limitation, with the condition that leads to
forfeiture being a

default on the loan. In earlier times, this parallel was
even closer, in that a mortgage was an actual transfer of title to the lender/
mortgagee, which would

be returned upon repayment of the loan. If the borrower/
mortgagor defaulted, the title would remain with the lender. As we have seen in
_Harms v.

Sprague_ (Chapter V), this “title” theory of mortgages at
common law has largely given way to a lien theory; even those states in which
mortgages are

cast in the form of a land conveyance treat mortgages

```



798



```

functionally as liens. Further, as we will discuss shortly,
the harshness of the traditional conveyance approach to mortgages, under which
the

borrower/mortgagor would lose the property no matter how
much of the loan had been paid at the time of default, has softened. After a
great deal of

maneuvering by parties, courts, and legislatures, a
mortgagee seeking foreclosure these days must be very careful and must afford
the mortgagor various

opportunities to repair the situation and retain ownership
of the property. In the case of personal property, the holder of the security
interest can much

more easily take possession of the collateral to satisfy the
loan, often including by means of self-help, as we saw in _Williams v. Ford
Motor Credit Co._

(Chapter IV).

2 .The mortgage or other security interest is distinct from
the debt it secures. In any mortgage of real estate, the purchaser of the real
estate (or

someone borrowing on already-owned real estate) often signs
and gives over two documents, a promissory note and the mortgage itself. The
promissory

note includes a promise to pay the principal with interest,
a schedule of payment due dates, and a list of conditions. ***** For example,
the note may include

a condition that upon a sale of the asset or failure to make
timely payment the entire balance is due immediately. The second piece of
paper, the

mortgage, secures the debt embodied in the promissory note.
It grants the lender (the obligee of the note) a conditional property interest
in the asset. The

mortgagor is thus the borrower (the obligor on the note) and
the owner of the asset. (For reasons we will see shortly, the mortgagor is also
often the one

with “equity” in the asset.) The mortgagee is the party with
the security interest and who is owed the balance of the loan plus interest. In
the case of

personal property, a security interest is often part of a
financing statement, which tends to be a separate piece of paper in addition to
the note itself.

3 .For both real estate and personal property, mortgages and
other security interests give their holders two rights, a “property right” and
a “priority

right,” and it is useful to keep these distinct. Both rights
relate to circumstances in which the debtor has trouble paying off the loan. In
the event of a

default on the loan or other breach, the _property right_
gives the secured party the right to take over the property and sell it to
satisfy the debt. Again, real

and personal property security interests differ
significantly in the level of procedural protections for the mortgagor. Process
requirements often make

security interests less attractive from the secured party’s
point of view; they can reduce the volume of lending and can lead to higher
interest rates or

evasions of such requirements by use of substitute devices.
The history of security interests is littered with decisions over how

```



799



```

to treat various installment sale contracts and special
leases, as well as more modern “bankruptcy remote vehicles” used in asset
securitizations.

The second right afforded by a security interest is the
_priority right_. This means that where collateral is sold to satisfy the debt,
the secured debt is

satisfied out of the proceeds of the collateral in its order
of seniority. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as enacted in the states,
a party with a

security interest in personal property has priority over
unsecured parties. Subject to exceptions, a secured party also has priority
over other secured

creditors according to the date on which it filed a
financing statement or perfected its security interest, whichever is earlier.
U.C.C. § 9 – 322. Perfection

normally involves a filing of the financing statement in the
prescribed place, or taking possession of the collateral. (Security interests
given to finance

the purchase of the property serving as security are
governed by special rules. See U.C.C. §§ 9 – 309 ( 1 ), 9 – 324 .)
Interestingly the current (revised)

Article 9 gives extra priority to possession or control,
U.C.C. §§ 9 – 313 , 9 – 314. Likewise, to preserve maximum priority, mortgages
of real property are

subject to the filing requirements of the state in which the
property is located. These systems vary, but all of them require some form of
notice for the

benefit of subsequent purchasers and lenders. Thus, a debt
secured by a first mortgage on real estate is paid before a debt secured by a
second mortgage,

and a second mortgage takes similar priority over a third
mortgage. Here “first mortgage” and “second mortgage” refer to priority rights,
and this

usually follows the date of their creation (and filing, as
required, see Chapter VIII), but parties can agree to subordinate their debt to
other debt, usually

in return for a higher interest rate. And all secured debt
has priority over unsecured debt. If a loan is undersecured, then it is treated
according to its

priority up to the amount of the security and the rest is
handled as unsecured debt. Thus, if a loan with an outstanding balance of $ 1 ,
000 is secured by

property worth only $ 800 , the secured party is entitled to
priority (within the hierarchy of secured debt if there is other secured debt)
for $ 800 and has an

unsecured claim for $ 200.

4 .The property right and the priority right afforded by a
security interest are most relevant for debtors in financial distress, and it
often happens

that such debtors wind up in bankruptcy with the security
interest in place. Bankruptcy law provides a procedure to collect the assets of
the debtor and

do a once-and-for-all division of these assets among the
various claimants. Bankruptcy is closely related to insolvency, the state of
having liabilities in

excess of one’s assets. Sometimes a solvent debtor can
choose to enter bankruptcy to effect a reorganization, for a variety of
reasons. Involuntary

bankruptcies, in which a creditor can force a debtor into
bankruptcy, are reserved for insolvent debtors. In the case of an individual
debtor, the

motivation is to provide a fresh start, subject to
restraints on using the mechanism by certain debtors. Many of the issues are
empirical, including the

reasons behind increased filings in recent years, and
normative, including the proper role of stigma and the fresh start.

It is sometimes said that bankruptcy reflects a policy of
trying to prevent creditors from racing to grab assets of a debtor on the brink
of insolvency

in an effort to satisfy themselves and leave other creditors
empty-handed. See,

```



800



```

e.g., Thomas H. Jackson, The Logic and Limits of Bankruptcy
Law ( 1986 ). For example, receiving a voluntary payment from the debtor 90
days or less

before the filing of a bankruptcy case may be deemed a
voidable preference, allowing the bankruptcy trustee to force its return to the
estate. 11 U.S.C.

§ 547 (b). Because they enjoy a priority right, lien
creditors and those with other security interests are generally in a better
position in bankruptcy

proceedings than are general creditors. This means they have
less reason to engage in racing behavior to try to grab the assets of a
creditor who is on the

verge of insolvency.

### B. LIENS AND THE PROBLEM OF NOTICE

Security interests present a basic informational problem
that is at the heart of property: How can people figure out which assets are
subject

to security interests? Without any limit on security
interests or requirements to register them, one would always face the problem
of the potential

“secret lien,” a problem that preoccupied people in earlier
times, and is still a live issue today. For example, when should a purchaser of
an asset

take the asset subject to the seller’s previously given
security interest in favor of a third party? In earlier times, when registries
were nonexistent

and commerce was simpler, possession was usually taken as
the best evidence of property rights. Thus, unless the lender took actual
possession

of the mortgaged property or collateral, the mortgagor would
appear to the rest of the world as an owner. Accordingly, many security
interests,

especially in earlier times, involved the lender taking
possession of the asset through a bailment, an arrangement which is called a
“pledge.” In

some ancient societies such as in Mesopotamia, lenders would
even take possession of land under a type of rent-free lease in order to secure

loans, an arrangement that is almost unknown in modern
economies. See Robert C. Ellickson & Charles DiA. Thorland, Ancient Land
Law:

Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel, 71 Chi.–Kent L. Rev. 321, 394–96
(1995). Later in the ancient world, markers on the land itself would give
notice of

a mortgage, as with the engraved marker-stone (called a
horos ) in ancient Athens. Id. at 397. Pledges of personal property are still
common,

notably in pawn shops. Where the lender takes possession as
security, the security interest does not present informational problems,
although the

lender as bailee might exceed its rights with respect to the
collateral. Often, however, a borrower wants to give security in an asset that
he will

continue to use, such as business equipment.

Today, security interests in which the borrower keeps
possession of the collateral are very common and well accepted. But this was
not

always so. Possession as evidence of ownership is both a
historic approach and a departure point for the more complicated schemes we
will study

in this Chapter and the next. Particularly in the case of
personal property, courts started from a basic suspicion of non-possessory
security

interests. These presented a problem of “ostensible
ownership,” in which

#801

third parties might deal with and lend further to the
borrower in the belief that his assets would be available to back those further
third-party

claims. In real estate, mortgages could be recorded, thus
diminishing but not extinguishing a similar concern about secret liens.

Liens exist in all sorts of shapes and sizes and can be
imposed as a matter of law as well as when someone takes out a loan and
consents to

give a security interest in return. Liens imposed as a
matter of law present particularly difficult problems of notice and can be a
surprise even to

the owner of an asset.

#### Timmer v. Gray

```



Minnesota Court of Appeals, 1986.



395 N.W. 2 d 477.



```

■
CRIPPEN, JUDGE. Appellants Martin and Lylia Timmer sought to obtain possession
of two farm discs they had purchased from Farmers Home

Administration. The trial court gave possession of the discs
to the Timmers, subject to an equitable lien in favor of respondent Jed
Maggert, who

had repaired the discs. The trial court determined that
Maggert’s unpaid repair bill necessitated an equitable lien in order to prevent
unjust

enrichment of the Timmers. We affirm.

FACTS

Terrance Heaton owned two farming discs. Heaton last used
the discs in 1982 and left them in disrepair on land he rented that year from

Tom Glowack. In 1984, the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA)
acquired legal title to the discs pursuant to a security agreement between the

FmHA and Heaton. The FmHA acquired possession of the discs
when Heaton filed bankruptcy. Although the FmHA had possession, the agency

chose to leave the discs on the land rented by Heaton. At
this time, Tom Glowack, the landowner, permitted William Gray, a neighboring
farmer,

to take possession of the discs. During 1984, Gray arranged
with respondent Jed Maggert to have the discs repaired. Maggert performed $857

worth of repairs on the discs, but did not receive any
compensation from Gray. The discs are presently worth substantially more than
the cost of

repair.

On December 7, 1984, Martin and Lylia Timmer purchased the
discs from the FmHA for $75. It is unclear whether Maggert completed all

of his repairs prior to the sale; however, the last work was
completed at about the time of the sale. The evidence does not suggest the FmHA
or

the Timmers had actual knowledge of Maggert’s repair work at
the time of the sale, nor does the evidence indicate that Maggert had any

information to suggest that Gray did not own the discs.

At the time of the sale, Gray possessed a fully repaired
disc and Maggert still had possession of the other disc. The Timmers brought an

action for replevin and conversion. Maggert counterclaimed
to recover the cost of his repair work. The trial court found the Timmers to be
the

rightful owners of the discs, subject to an equitable lien
in favor of Maggert. The Timmers appeal that portion of the order granting
Maggert an

equitable lien.

ISSUE

Did the trial court err in awarding respondent an equitable
lien on appellants’ property based on the theory of unjust enrichment?

ANALYSIS

The trial court awarded Maggert an equitable lien based on
the theory of unjust enrichment. Considerations of right and justice and
various

equitable maxims warrant the imposition of an equitable lien
in certain instances. See Lindell v. Lindell, 185 N.W. 929, 930 (Minn. 1921).
The

theory of unjust enrichment is “founded on the principle
that no one ought unjustly to enrich himself at the expense of another.” Cady
v. Bush,

166 N.W.2d 358, 361 (Minn. 1969) (quoting Heywood v.
Northern Assurance Co., 158 N.W. 632, 633 (Minn. 1916)).

Actions for unjust enrichment may be based on failure of
consideration, fraud, mistake, and situations where it would be morally

#803

wrong for one party to enrich himself at the expense of
another. See, e.g., Anderson v. DeLisle, 352 N.W.2d 794, 796 (Minn. Ct. App.
1984)

(unjust enrichment action based on considerations of moral
wrongness); Cady, 166 N.W.2d at 361 (unjust enrichment action based on failure
of

consideration, fraud or mistake); Knox v. Knox, 25 N.W.2d
225, 229 (Minn. 1946) (unjust enrichment action based on unconscientious
retention

of property).

The failure of consideration, mistake and moral wrongness
encompassing this case mandates imposition of an equitable lien based on the

theory of unjust enrichment. The Timmers paid $75 for what
they mistakenly believed to be a pair of discs in disrepair. Instead, Maggert’s
repair

work provided the Timmers with a pair of discs worth much
more. In this situation, it would be wrong to allow the Timmers to receive

substantially improved property, for a nominal price, at
Maggert’s expense.

Our conclusion is forged in part by the fact that Maggert
performed his repair work while Heaton or the FmHA owned the discs, causing the

equitable lien to attach during the FmHA’s possession. The
personal property had been left unattended for over two years and its
enrichment at

the expense of an unknowing repairman is evident. An
equitable lien is enforceable against any person who subsequently acquires the

encumbered property, except a bona fide purchaser for value,
without notice of the lien. See Minn.Stat. § 514.18, subd. 3 (1984) (mechanic’s
lien

on personal property valid against everyone except a
purchaser without notice and for value); see also Whiteside v. Rocky Mountain
Fuel Co.,

101 F.2d 765, 770 (10th Cir.1938).

We cannot conclude that Maggert’s lien is expunged by
purchasers who pay a nominal amount for property they fail to examine. The

Timmers lack the status of bona fide purchasers. Payment of
$75 for property worth much more constitutes a lack of value. See
Nichols-Frissell

Co. v. Crocker, 157 N.W. 1072, 1072 (Minn. 1916) (payment of
a small sum for title examination and quit claim deed did not constitute
value);

see also Tremont v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 223
N.W. 137 (Minn. 1929) (payment of over one-half the purchase price constituted
the

value necessary to support the contract).

Furthermore, it cannot be said that FmHA or the Timmers were
without notice that the discs had been repaired. A simple inspection would

have revealed Maggert’s possession and improvements. Equity
says if a loss is to fall on one of two innocent parties, it should fall on one
who is

in a better position to prevent it. Hughes v. Monnahan, 165
N.W.2d 231, 234 (Minn. 1969). We have considered Maggert’s opportunities to
check

on ownership of the discs, but we conclude that any
shortcoming of Maggert was outweighed by the Timmers’ failure to prevent their
loss by

inspecting the property prior to purchase.

Our conclusion would differ had the Timmers inspected the
discs and paid value for them. These actions would allow us to view the

Timmers

#804

as innocent parties and extinguish Maggert’s equitable lien.
Maggert would then be left with an unjust enrichment action against earlier
owners.

Since this is not the scenario, an equitable lien in favor
of Maggert is necessary to prevent unjustly enriching the Timmers. The
litigation in this

case has not addressed the question whether Timmers assert
or enjoy rescission rights on their purchase of the discs.

DECISION

The trial court’s order granting Maggert an equitable lien
on the Timmers’ discs is affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1. _Timmer_ involves several kinds of security interests,
   both voluntary and involuntary. The problem addressed by the court begins when
   farmer

Heaton borrows money from a federal government agency, the
FmHA, and in return gives the agency a security interest in some of his
personal

property, including the discs. When Heaton fails to repay
the debt and declares bankruptcy, the FmHA is entitled to repossess the discs
and sell them, in

order to obtain at least partial repayment of the debt.
Although the court says the FmHA “acquired possession” when Heaton failed to
repay, it does not

mean this literally; what it means is that the agency had
the right to foreclose on its security interest and sell the discs. Actual
physical possession of the

discs at the time of the foreclosure, unbeknownst to the
FmHA, had been transferred to farmer Gray and from Gray to Maggert, whom Gray
had

requested to repair the discs. There is no sign or other
indication on the discs that they are subject to a security interest in favor
of the FmHA, or that the

debt on which the security interest is based has not been
paid. Thus, when farmer Gray asks Maggert to repair the discs, neither of them,
presumably, is

aware of the government’s security interest. When the FmHA
sells the discs in partial satisfaction of the security interest to the Timmers
for $ 75 , the

Timmers have never inspected the discs and are, of course,
unaware of the repairs that Maggert has made, increasing the value of the discs
to much more

than $ 75.

2 .In theory, the repairs executed by Maggert could give
rise to an involuntary security interest called a mechanic’s lien. At common
law, persons

who provided repairs or performed other services on personal
property were held to have a mechanic’s lien, which applied as long as they
retained

possession of the personal property. Innkeepers and
operators of warehouses would also have a lien on goods in their possession in
a similar fashion.

Today, mechanic’s liens are almost always governed by
statute. The Minnesota Mechanics’ Lien statute, in effect when the principal
case was decided

and cited by the court, reads as follows:

```



M.S.A. § 514. 18



Subdivision 1. Mechanics’ lien on personal property.
Whoever, at the request of the owner or legal possessor of any personal
property,



shall store or care for or contribute * * * to its
preservation, care, or to the enhancement of its value, shall have a



```

```



805



```

lien upon such property for the price or value of such
storage, care, or contribution, and for any legal charges against the same paid
by such

person to any other person, and the right to retain
possession of the property until such lien is lawfully discharged.

**Subd. 2. Nonpossessory lien; notice.** Notwithstanding the
voluntary surrender or other loss of possession of the property on which the
lien is

claimed, the person entitled thereto may preserve the lien
upon giving notice of the lien at any time within 60 days after the surrender
or loss

of possession, by filing in the appropriate filing office
under the Uniform Commercial Code, Minnesota Statutes, section 336. 9 – 501 a
verified

statement and notice of intention to claim a lien. The
statement shall contain a description of the property upon which the lien is
claimed, the

work performed or materials furnished and the amount due.

**Subd. 3. Priority; security; interest; foreclosure.** The
lien shall be valid against everyone except a purchaser or encumbrancer in good
faith

without notice and for value whose rights were acquired
prior to the filing of the lien statement and who has filed a statement of
interest in the

appropriate filing office. The lien shall be considered a
security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and foreclosure thereon
shall be

in the manner prescribed for security interests under
article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.

**Subd. 4. Motor vehicles excluded.** Subdivisions 2 and 3
shall apply to machinery, implements and tools of all kinds but shall not apply
to

motor vehicles.

3 .Did Jed Maggert, who repaired the discs, comply with the
Mechanics’ Lien statute? If not, why not? If a mechanic fails to comply with
the

statute, is it proper for the court to declare an “equitable
lien” that performs the same function as a mechanic’s lien? For a recent
decision that throws out

a mechanic’s lien for $ 3. 2 million of landscaping services
because the landscaping company failed to comply with a confusing notice
provision, see

Shady Tree Farms v. Omni Financial, 14 1 Cal.Rptr. 3 d 112
(Cal. Ct. App. 2012 ).

4 .How can the court say that the Timmers did not acquire
the discs as bona fide purchasers for value? The court does not suggest that
the Timmers

had any notice of the repairs performed by Maggert.
Occasionally courts will decide that a bill of sale or deed that recites “$ 1
and other valuable

consideration” does not establish a purchase “for value.”
See, e.g., Hood v. Webster, infra Chapter VIII. But the Timmers paid $ 75 for
the discs, which

was evidently the price set by the FmHA. What if the Timmers
purchased the discs to add to their collection of old farm machinery in their
yard, and had

no intention of paying the much higher price for a
fully-functioning set of repaired discs?

5 .Mechanic’s liens reflect some specific policies,
centering around the protection of trade creditors and the facilitation of
improvement projects.

Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who wanted to promote
the building

```

of Washington, D.C., were a driving force behind the first
mechanic’s lien statute, in Maryland, which embraced the District in 1791.
Unlike mechanic’s

liens for personal property, mechanic’s liens on real
property are solely created by statute. Many kinds of professionals can now
claim mechanic’s liens,

including in the case of real estate a wide variety of
contractors and even design professionals. What sets them apart from many other
liens on real estate

is that they are frequently valid against third parties even
before they are “perfected” (usually by filing), and states vary as to how long
an unperfected

mechanic’s lien has third-party effect. For this reason, an
exclusive focus on the deservingness of the potential lien holder can lead to
overlooking the

unfairness and information costs this imposes on other
creditors and potential purchasers of assets. See Chad J. Pomeroy, Ending
Surprise Liens on Real

Property, 11 Nev. L.J. 139 ( 2010 ) (discerning a trend
toward greater allowance of surprise liens because of concern for the
lienholder and arguing

against trend on fairness and information cost grounds). How
easy should it be for lien creditors to get priority over other creditors?

6 .All security interests are intangible rights, and hence
all present a potential problem of notice. One solution to the problem of
notice is for the

party holding the security interest to retain possession of
the property subject to the security interest, as under the common law
mechanic’s lien. This is

also the solution when the security interest takes the form
of a pledge, as in the case of pawnshop loans. Another solution is to require
actual notice of

the security interest to potential interested parties, as
required by some statutory mechanic’s lien statutes. A third solution, as under
the Minnesota

Mechanics’ Lien statute, is to require that security
interests be publicly recorded, in some kind of public repository of
information about property titles

(see Chapter VIII). Which solution is best? Is there any way
to provide notice of interests that are imposed as a matter of equity, such as
constructive

trusts or the “equitable lien” adopted in the principal case
by the Minnesota appeals court?

7 .As we will see in the next Chapter, the notice problem
has been partially solved through recording systems for real estate and related
filing

systems for security interests in personal property. Some
commentators see security interests as primarily a contractual problem with few
or no third-

party effects, see, e.g., Alan Schwartz, A Theory of Loan
Priorities, 18 J. Legal Stud. 209 , 220 – 22 , 249 – 59 ( 1989 ), while others
see them as presenting

ostensible ownership problems for such third parties, see,
e.g., Jonathan C. Lipson, Secrets and Liens: The End of Notice in Commercial
Finance Law,

21 Emory Bankr. Dev. J. 421 ( 2005 ). Like bailments,
leases, and trusts, security interests have both a contractual and property
aspect. See Thomas W.

Merrill & Henry E. Smith, The Property/Contract
Interface, 101 Colum. L. Rev. 773 , 833 – 43 ( 2001 ). The Uniform Commercial
Code still allows

perfection of security interests by possession. UCC § 9 –
313 (a). Such a security interest is known as a pledge. Indeed, this is the
only way to create a

security interest in money. As we will see in greater detail
in the next Chapter, some instruments are negotiable, meaning that under a wide
variety of

circumstances, the current holder is entitled to payment and
is

```



807



```

free from most defenses; money is the ultimate in
negotiability in that one can get good title to cash even from a thief.
Generally, the more negotiable

something is, the more a security interest in it has to be
by possession. Can you see why? Negotiability and ostensible ownership rules
(e.g., good faith

purchaser) are in part about allocating information costs,
the burdens of inquiry, and the costs of errors as between affected parties to
a transaction.

The “Puzzle” of Secured Debt

Secured debt has been treated by commentators as something
of a “puzzle” and has been regarded with a certain degree of suspicion. The

excerpt from Ronald Mann, supra, explains why lenders prefer
secured rather than unsecured debt. But commentators have been puzzled about

why borrowers take on secured debt as well as unsecured
debt, instead of simply allowing all creditors to share pro rata in their
assets. Thomas

H. Jackson & Anthony T. Kronman, Secured Financing and
Priority Among Creditors, 88 Yale L.J. 1 143, 1146 (1979). True, the secured
lender

will offer a lower interest rate because of the decreased
risk that it will not be repaid. But this simply raises the interest rate on
whatever other

debt the borrower will take on and lowers the value of the
borrower’s equity interest. At first blush, the total amount of risk remains
the same,

and manipulating the ratio of secured debt to unsecured debt
(or debt to other equity-like interests) should not make any difference to
total value

under the control of a person or firm.

Some have gone further and argued that secured debt is
objectionable on social policy grounds: By taking out secured debt, the
borrower

gets a lower interest rate, but contrary to initial
appearances not all other creditors adjust their interest rates to reflect the
increased risk left over

for them. The clearest case is tort creditors: Tort victims
have no way of avoiding interactions with tortfeasors who are loaded up with
secured

debt, but the secured debt may make a judgment against the
tortfeasor less valuable since it will have lower priority. Perhaps other
creditors are

also “nonadjusting” in this way; candidates would include
trade creditors. See, e.g., Lucian Arye Bebchuk & Jesse M. Fried, The
Uneasy Case

for the Priority of Secured Claims in Bankruptcy, 105 Yale
L.J. 857, 885 (1996); Luke Sperduto, Three and A Half Rules for Tort Claims in
(and

Out of) Chapter 1 1, 95 Am. Bankr. L.J. 127 (2021).
Empirical evidence is scarce. One study calls into question whether fraud on
nonadjusting

creditors actually occurs. See Yair Listokin, Is Secured
Debt Used to Redistribute Value from Tort Claimants in Bankruptcy? An Empirical

Analysis, 57 Duke L.J. 1037, 1078 (2008) (presenting results
that suggest that firms do not use secured debt to exploit tort claimants). A
recent

empirical study finds that firms increase their use of
secured debt as they approach bankruptcy. Barry E. Adler & Vedran Capkun,
Debt-Equity

Conflict and the Incidence of Secured Credit, 62 J.L. &
Econ. 551 (2019).

#808

More benign explanations for secured credit have also been
offered. A secured creditor can specialize in monitoring a given asset, and
this

specialization can lower overall information costs. Debt
holders must worry about the actions of the (equity) owners of the firm,
because the

latter will have an incentive to take risks with the firm’s
assets (including substituting them for riskier assets): The equity owners as
holders of

the residual claim will enjoy all of the upside, but will be
able to force debt holders to take more downside risk. These “agency costs” can
be

addressed by security interests. The secured creditor
specializes in monitoring the asset held as security. This reduces overall
monitoring costs

because it prevents duplicative monitoring of any given
asset and prevents freeriding by other debt holders on these monitoring
efforts.

Moreover, each secured creditor can specialize in a class of
asset (and a particular asset within the class as well), and need not worry
about the

interaction of risk from other assets with the risk from the
asset in question. See, e.g., Jackson & Kronman, supra; Hideki Kanda &
Saul

Levmore, Explaining Creditor Priorities, 80 Va. L. Rev. 2103
(1994); Saul Levmore, Monitors and Freeriders in Commercial and Corporate

Settings, 92 Yale L.J. 49 (1982); see also Henry Hansmann
& Reinier Kraakman, The Essential Role of Organizational Law, 110 Yale L.J.
387,

417–23 (2000). In other words, the benefits of a security
interest seem to be a special case of the internalization and information-cost
benefits of

property rights more generally. Bankruptcy, a subject for
another course, has a slightly different effect on each of these rights.

### C. REAL ESTATE MORTGAGES

Although we have seen that personal intangible property,
especially intellectual property, is now more important than ever, land
continues to

be a convenient asset against which to borrow. The very
features that make land a good candidate for centralized records—its value,
fixed

location, and permanence—make it a good candidate for an
asset to use to secure loans, particularly long-term loans and even loans whose

proceeds will be used to finance projects other than the
acquisition of the real estate. The land records themselves make the
functioning of

mortgages smoother, although not without some bumpiness, as
we will see in the next Chapter.

Some mortgages are taken on property already owned by the
borrower, but many mortgages are purchase money mortgages, used to finance

the acquisition of the real property used as security for
the loan. (Many personal property security interests likewise are purchase
money security

interests, and these receive special favorable treatment
under the UCC. Think of security interests in consumer goods like cars or
household

furniture.) In transactions involving a purchase money
mortgage, the source of the financing can be the seller of the asset or a
financial

institution. In the case of financial institutions, the
mortgages are very often bought and sold, often in packages, to other
institutions.

#809

A real estate mortgage typically secures payment on a note
used to borrow the money to purchase the property. The mortgage document

represents the security interest and the note contains the
terms of and evidences the loan itself. The mortgage and the note are separate.
In times

past, courts subscribed to a title theory of mortgages, in
which the borrower would transfer legal title to the lender and would only get
it back

upon payment of the note. These days courts treat mortgages
as liens, regardless of the form that they take, even if the mortgage purports
to

convey legal title. One can say that if the title is
“transferred” merely to secure repayment of a note, then it is treated as a
lien. As we will see,

because of the efforts of parties, especially mortgagees, to
avoid the protections afforded by courts to mortgagors, there has been a
complex

history of form and substance in the area of mortgages.

Much of the terminology of mortgage law derives from the
history of the courts of equity, although the meaning of the terms has in many

cases changed over time. As the borrower made payments, he
acquired important protections against forfeiture, especially in courts of
equity

(recall that equity abhors a forfeiture). One of these
protections was the right to redeem the property even after a default, called
the “equity of

redemption.” This is the source of the term “equity” to
denote the stake that a homeowner has built up in the real property.

In addition to “equity,” the terms “foreclosure” and
“redemption” have several related meanings, because in the history of mortgage

lending, legislatures, courts, and contracting parties have
innovated at many points and have reacted to each other’s moves. The term

“foreclosure” traces back to what is also known as “strict
foreclosure,” a regime under which the mortgagee would have the right to be
declared

the owner of the premises without any sale of the premises.
Between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, strict foreclosure gradually
gave

way to a system of foreclosure followed by sale, known as
“judicial foreclosure” or “foreclosure by judicial sale.” The mortgagee was
allowed to

bid for the property but the process was subject to notice
and other procedural requirements to protect the mortgagor and to help ensure a
fair

price.

“Foreclosure” can also refer as a shorthand to “foreclosure
by sale.” In a fashion reminiscent of landlords with their reenter and relet

clauses, mortgagees would avoid the complexities of going to
the equity court and obtaining a judicial foreclosure by putting a clause in
the

mortgage indenture providing for an express authority in the
mortgagee upon default of the mortgagor to sell the property free of the equity
of

redemption. This power of sale was later subjected to some
of the same judicial safeguards and procedures associated with judicial
foreclosure.

“Redemption” is correspondingly ambiguous. As noted it can
refer to the equitable period of redemption (“equity of redemption”)

developed by courts of equity, and “foreclosure” originally
meant foreclosure of the equity of redemption. More typically today it is a
period

provided for by

#810

statute during which the mortgagor has the right to redeem
the property even after a foreclosure sale. The mechanics involved and the
duration of

the redemption period vary widely by state. A typical period
would be one year after foreclosure sale. This means that the purchaser of the

property at the foreclosure sale cannot be certain of
retaining the property, as opposed to being forced to return it for the
purchase price plus

interest, for the period of one year.

Jurisdictions also differ as to whether a mortgagee can seek
a deficiency judgment against the mortgagor if the mortgaged premises turn out

at sale to be worth less than the outstanding note. Where
personal recourse is possible according to its terms and allowed by law, a note
is said to

be recourse; if not, a note is nonrecourse, and the debtor
can walk away from the property without further liability. In some states
residential

mortgages must be nonrecourse, but home equity loans (for
improvements or simply access to a house’s value) are permitted to be recourse.

Legislatures as well as courts have been active in the
history of mortgages and foreclosures. Ever since 1820 in the aftermath of the

Napoleonic Wars, legislatures have vacillated between
facilitating powers of sale in good times and hedging them about with
restrictions in favor

of mortgagors in periods of economic distress. Often
legislatures would institute or lengthen periods of redemption (whether before
or after

foreclosure sale) in times of widespread default, and would
shorten them in flush times. Before the mortgage crisis starting in 2007, the
most

recent episode of wholesale legislative intervention on
behalf of mortgagors took place during the Great Depression, which led a number
of

states to pass mortgage moratoria. The U.S. Supreme Court
upheld the Minnesota moratorium in the face of Contracts Clause and Due Process

challenges in Home Building and Loan Association v.
Blaisdell , 290 U.S. 398 (1934). The Minnesota Mortgage Moratorium Law had
declared

that during the emergency period, mortgagors could obtain
relief from foreclosure and execution sales through authorized judicial
proceedings

and that periods of redemption could be extended. The Court
stated that “[t]he economic interests of the State may justify the exercise of
its

continuing and dominant protective power notwithstanding
interference with contracts,” id. at 437, and likened mass foreclosures
stemming from

the Depression to natural disasters. Whether and how to
provide relief in times of widespread financial distress is a live issue today
and one to

which we return at the end of this Chapter.

#### Murphy v. Financial Development Corporation

```



Supreme Court of New Hampshire, 1985.



495 A. 2 d 1245.



```

■
DOUGLAS, JUSTICE. The plaintiffs brought this action seeking to set aside the
foreclosure sale of their home, or, in the alternative, money

damages. The Superior Court ( Bean, J.), adopting the
recommendation

#811

of a Master ( R. Peter Shapiro, Esq.), entered a judgment
for the plaintiffs in the amount of $27,000 against two of the defendants,
Financial

Development Corporation and Colonial Deposit Company (the
lenders).

The plaintiffs purchased a house in Nashua in 1966,
financing it by means of a mortgage loan. They refinanced the loan in March of
1980,

executing a new promissory note and a power of sale
mortgage, with Financial Development Corporation as mortgagee. The note and
mortgage

were later assigned to Colonial Deposit Company.

In February of 1981, the plaintiff Richard Murphy became
unemployed. By September of 1981, the plaintiffs were seven months in arrears

on their mortgage payments, and had also failed to pay
substantial amounts in utility assessments and real estate taxes. After
discussing

unsuccessfully with the plaintiffs proposals for revising
the payment schedule, rewriting the note, and arranging alternative financing,
the lenders

gave notice on October 6, 1981, of their intent to
foreclose.

During the following weeks, the plaintiffs made a concerted
effort to avoid foreclosure. They paid the seven months’ mortgage arrearage,

but failed to pay some $643.18 in costs and legal fees
associated with the foreclosure proceedings. The lenders scheduled the
foreclosure sale for

November 10, 1981, at the site of the subject property. They
complied with all of the statutory requirements for notice. See RSA 479:25.

At the plaintiffs’ request, the lenders agreed to postpone
the sale until December 15, 1981. They advised the plaintiffs that this would
entail

an additional cost of $100, and that the sale would proceed
unless the lenders received payment of $743.18, as well as all mortgage
payments

then due, by December 15. Notice of the postponement was
posted on the subject property on November 10 at the originally scheduled time
of

the sale, and was also posted at the Nashua City Hall and
Post Office. No prospective bidders were present for the scheduled sale.

In late November, the plaintiffs paid the mortgage payment
which had been due in October, but made no further payments to the lenders. An

attempt by the lenders to arrange new financing for the
plaintiffs through a third party failed when the plaintiffs refused to agree to
pay for a new

appraisal of the property. Early on the morning of December
15, 1981, the plaintiffs tried to obtain a further postponement, but were
advised by

the lenders’ attorney that it was impossible unless the
costs and legal fees were paid.

At the plaintiffs’ request, the attorney called the
president of Financial Development Corporation, who also refused to postpone
the sale.

Further calls by the plaintiffs to the lenders’ offices were
equally unavailing.

The sale proceeded as scheduled at 10:00 a.m. on December
15, at the site of the property. Although it had snowed the previous night, the

#812

weather was clear and warm at the time of the sale, and the
roads were clear. The only parties present were the plaintiffs, a
representative of the

lenders, and an attorney, Morgan Hollis, who had been
engaged to conduct the sale because the lenders’ attorney, who lived in Dover,
had been

apprehensive about the weather the night before. The
lenders’ representative made the only bid at the sale. That bid of $27,000,
roughly the

amount owed on the mortgage, plus costs and fees, was
accepted and the sale concluded.

Later that same day, Attorney Hollis encountered one of his
clients, William Dube, a representative of the defendant Southern New

Hampshire Home Traders, Inc. (Southern). On being informed
of the sale, Mr. Dube contacted the lenders and offered to buy the property for

$27,000. The lenders rejected the offer and made a counter
offer of $40,000. Within two days a purchase price of $38,000 was agreed upon
by

Mr. Dube and the lenders and the sale was subsequently
completed.

The plaintiffs commenced this action on February 5, 1982.
The lenders moved to dismiss, arguing that any action was barred because the

plaintiffs had failed to petition for an injunction prior to
the sale. The master denied the motion. After hearing the evidence, he ruled
for the

plaintiffs, finding that the lenders had “failed to exercise
good faith and due diligence in obtaining a fair price for the subject property
at the

foreclosure sale... .”

The master also ruled that Southern was a bona fide
purchaser for value, and thus had acquired legal title to the house. That
ruling is not at

issue here. He assessed monetary damages against the lenders
equal to “the difference between the fair market value of the subject property
on

the date of the foreclosure and the price obtained at said
sale.”

Having found the fair market value to be $54,000, he
assessed damages accordingly at $27,000. He further ruled that “[t]he bad faith
of the

‘Lenders’ warrants an award of legal fees.” The lenders
appealed.

The first issue before us is whether the master erred in
denying the motion to dismiss. The lenders, in support of their argument, rely
upon

RSA 4 79:25, II, which gives a mortgagor the right to
petition the superior court to enjoin a proposed foreclosure sale, and then
provides: “Failure

to institute such petition and complete service upon the
foreclosing party, or his agent, conducting the sale prior to sale shall
thereafter bar any

action or right of action of the mortgagor based on the
validity of the foreclosure.”

If we were to construe this provision as the lenders urge us
to do, it would prevent a mortgagor from challenging the validity of a sale in
a

case where the only claimed unfairness or illegality
occurred during the sale itself—unless the mortgagor had petitioned for an
injunction before

any grounds existed on which the injunction could be
granted. We will not construe a statute so as to produce such an illogical and
unjust result.

#813

The only reasonable construction of the language in RSA
479:25, II relied upon by the lenders is that it bars any action based on facts
which

the mortgagor knew or should have known soon enough to
reasonably permit the filing of a petition prior to the sale.

The master could not have found that this was such an
action, because the only unfairness referred to in his report involves the
amount of

the sale price. Thus, his denial of the lenders’ motion to
dismiss was proper.

The second issue before us is whether the master erred in
concluding that the lenders had failed to comply with the often-repeated rule
that a

mortgagee executing a power of sale is bound both by the
statutory procedural requirements and by a duty to protect the interests of the

mortgagor through the exercise of good faith and due
diligence. We will not overturn a master’s findings and rulings “unless they
are

unsupported by the evidence or are erroneous as a matter of
law.” Summit Electric, Inc. v. Pepin Brothers Const., Inc., 427 A.2d 505, 507
(N.H.

1981).

The master found that the lenders, throughout the time prior
to the sale, “did not mislead or deal unfairly with the plaintiffs.” They
engaged

in serious efforts to avoid foreclosure through new
financing, and agreed to one postponement of the sale. The basis for the
master’s decision was

his conclusion that the lenders had failed to exercise good
faith and due diligence in obtaining a fair price for the property.

This court’s past decisions have not dealt consistently with
the question whether the mortgagee’s duty amounts to that of a fiduciary or

trustee. Compare Pearson v. Gooch, 40 A. 390, 390–91 (N.H.
1897) and Merrimack Industrial Trust v. First Nat. Bank of Boston, 427 A.2d
500,

504 (N.H. 1981) (duty amounts to that of a fiduciary or
trustee) with Silver v. First National Bank, 236 A.2d 493, 494–95 (N.H. 1967)
and

Proctor v. Bank of N.H., 464 A.2d 263, 266 (N.H. 1983) (duty
does not amount to that of a fiduciary or trustee). This may be an inevitable
result

of the mortgagee’s dual role as seller and potential buyer
at the foreclosure sale, and of the conflicting interests involved.

We need not label a duty, however, in order to define it. In
his role as a seller, the mortgagee’s duty of good faith and due diligence is

essentially that of a fiduciary. Such a view is in keeping
with “[t]he ‘trend... towards liberalizing the term [fiduciary] in order to
prevent unjust

enrichment.’ ” Lash v. Cheshire County Savings Bank, Inc.,
474 A.2d 980, 981 (N.H. 1984) (quoting Cornwell v. Cornwell, 356 A.2d 683, 686

(N.H. 1976)).

A mortgagee, therefore, must exert every reasonable effort
to obtain “a fair and reasonable price under the circumstances,” Reconstruction

Finance Corp. v. Faulkner, 143 A.2d 403, 410 (N.H. 1958),
even to the extent, if necessary, of adjourning the sale or of establishing “an
upset

#814

price below which he will not accept any offer.” Lakes
Region Fin. Corp. v. Goodhue Boat Yard, Inc., 382 A.2d 1108, 1 11 1 (N.H.
1978).

What constitutes a fair price, or whether the mortgagee must
establish an upset price, adjourn the sale, or make other reasonable efforts to

assure a fair price, depends on the circumstances of each
case. Inadequacy of price alone is not sufficient to demonstrate bad faith
unless the

price is so low as to shock the judicial conscience.

We must decide, in the present case, whether the evidence
supports the finding of the master that the lenders failed to exercise good
faith

and due diligence in obtaining a fair price for the
plaintiffs’ property.

We first note that “[t]he duties of good faith and due
diligence are distinct.... One may be observed and not the other, and any
inquiry as to

their breach calls for a separate consideration of each.”
Wheeler v. Slocinski, 131 A. at 600 (N.H. 19 26). In order “to constitute bad
faith there

must be an intentional disregard of duty or a purpose to
injure.” Id. at 600–01.

There is insufficient evidence in the record to support the
master’s finding that the lenders acted in bad faith in failing to obtain a
fair price

for the plaintiffs’ property. The lenders complied with the
statutory requirements of notice and otherwise conducted the sale in compliance
with

statutory provisions. The lenders postponed the sale one
time and did not bid with knowledge of any immediately available subsequent

purchaser. Further, there is no evidence indicating an
intent on the part of the lenders to injure the mortgagor by, for example,
discouraging other

buyers.

There is ample evidence in the record, however, to support
the master’s finding that the lenders failed to exercise due diligence in
obtaining

a fair price. “The issue of the lack of due diligence is
whether a reasonable man in the [lenders’] place would have adjourned the
sale,” id. at 601,

or taken other measures to receive a fair price.

In early 1980, the plaintiffs’ home was appraised at
$46,000. At the time of the foreclosure sale on December 15, 1981, the lenders
had not

had the house reappraised to take into account improvements
and appreciation. The master found that a reasonable person in the place of the

lenders would have realized that the plaintiffs’ equity in
the property was at least $19,000, the difference between the 1980 appraised
value of

$46,000 and the amount owed on the mortgage totaling
approximately $27,000.

At the foreclosure sale, the lenders were the only bidders.
The master found that their bid of $27,000 “was sufficient to cover all monies
due

and did not create a deficiency balance” but “did not
provide for a return of any of the plaintiffs’ equity.”

Further, the master found that the lenders “had reason to
know” that “they stood to make a substantial profit on a quick turnaround
sale.” On

the day of the sale, the lenders offered to sell the
foreclosed property

#815

to William Dube for $40,000. Within two days after the
foreclosure sale, they did in fact agree to sell it to Dube for $38,000. It was
not necessary

for the master to find that the lenders knew of a specific
potential buyer before the sale in order to show lack of good faith or due
diligence as the

lenders contend. The fact that the lenders offered the
property for sale at a price sizably above that for which they had purchased
it, only a few

hours before, supports the master’s finding that the lenders
had reason to know, at the time of the foreclosure sale, that they could make a

substantial profit on a quick turnaround sale. For this
reason, they should have taken more measures to ensure receiving a higher price
at the sale.

While a mortgagee may not always be required to secure a
portion of the mortgagor’s equity, such an obligation did exist in this case.
The

substantial amount of equity which the plaintiffs had in
their property, the knowledge of the lenders as to the appraised value of the
property, and

the plaintiffs’ efforts to forestall foreclosure by paying
the mortgage arrearage within weeks of the sale, all support the master’s
conclusion that

the lenders had a fiduciary duty to take more reasonable
steps than they did to protect the plaintiffs’ equity by attempting to obtain a
fair price for

the property. They could have established an appropriate
upset price to assure a minimum bid. They also could have postponed the auction
and

advertised commercially by display advertising in order to
assure that bidders other than themselves would be present.

Instead, as Theodore DiStefano, an officer of both lending
institutions testified, the lenders made no attempt to obtain fair market value
for

the property but were concerned only with making themselves
“whole.” On the facts of this case, such disregard for the interests of the

mortgagors was a breach of duty by the mortgagees.

Although the lenders did comply with the statutory
requirements of notice of the foreclosure sale, these efforts were not
sufficient in this

case to demonstrate due diligence. At the time of the
initially scheduled sale, the extent of the lenders’ efforts to publicize the
sale of the property

was publication of a legal notice of the mortgagees’ sale at
public auction on November 10, published once a week for three weeks in the
Nashua

Telegraph, plus postings in public places. The lenders did
not advertise, publish, or otherwise give notice to the general public of
postponement

of the sale to December 15, 1981, other than by posting
notices at the plaintiffs’ house, at the post office, and at city hall. That
these efforts to

advertise were ineffective is evidenced by the fact that no
one, other than the lenders, appeared at the sale to bid on the property. This
fact

allowed the lenders to purchase the property at a minimal
price and then to profit substantially in a quick turnaround sale.

We recognize a need to give guidance to a trial court which
must determine whether a mortgagee who has complied with the strict letter of

the statutory law has nevertheless violated his additional
duties of good faith and due diligence. A finding that the mortgagee had, or
should

#816

have had, knowledge of his ability to get a higher price at
an adjourned sale is the most conclusive evidence of such a violation. See
Lakes

Region Fin. Corp. v. Goodhue Boat Yard, Inc., 382 A.2d at 1
11 1.

More generally, we are in agreement with the official
Commissioners’ Comment to section 3–508 of the Uniform Land Transactions Act:

The requirement that the sale be conducted in a reasonable
manner, including the advertising aspects, requires that the person

conducting the sale use the ordinary methods of making
buyers aware that are used when an owner is voluntarily selling his land. Thus

an advertisement in the portion of a daily newspaper where
these ads are placed or, in appropriate cases such as the sale of an industrial

plant, a display advertisement in the financial sections of
the daily newspaper may be the most reasonable method. In other cases

employment of a professional real estate agent may be the
more reasonable method. It is unlikely that an advertisement in a legal

publication among other legal notices would qualify as a
commercially reasonable method of sale advertising.

13 Uniform Laws Annotated 704 (West 1980). As discussed
above, the lenders met neither of these guidelines.

While agreeing with the master that the lenders failed to
exercise due diligence in this case, we find that he erred as a matter of law
in

awarding damages equal to “the difference between the fair
market value of the subject property... and the price obtained at [the] sale.”

Such a formula may well be the appropriate measure where bad
faith is found. In such a case, a mortgagee’s conduct amounts to more than

mere negligence. Damages based upon the fair market value, a
figure in excess of a fair price, will more readily induce mortgagees to
perform

their duties properly. A “fair” price may or may not yield a
figure close to fair market value; however, it will be that price arrived at as
a result of

due diligence by the mortgagee.

Where, as here, however, a mortgagee fails to exercise due
diligence, the proper assessment of damages is the difference between a fair

price for the property and the price obtained at the
foreclosure sale. We have held, where lack of due diligence has been found,
that “the test is

not ‘fair market value’ as in eminent domain cases nor is
the mortgagee bound to give credit for the highest possible amount which might
be

obtained under different circumstances, as at an owner’s
sale.” Silver v. First National Bank, 236 A.2d 493, 495 (N.H. 1967) (quoting

Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Faulkner, 143 A.2d 403, 410
(N.H. 1958)) (citation omitted). Accordingly, we remand to the trial court for
a

reassessment of damages consistent with this opinion.

Because we concluded above that there was no “bad faith or
obstinate, unjust, vexatious, wanton, or oppressive conduct,” on the part

#817

of the lenders, we see no reason to stray from our general
rule that the prevailing litigant is not entitled to collect attorney’s fees
from the loser.

Therefore, we reverse this part of the master’s decision.

Reversed in part; affirmed in part; remanded.

■ BROCK,
JUSTICE, dissenting: I agree with the majority that a mortgagee, in its role as
seller at a foreclosure sale, has a fiduciary duty to the

mortgagor. I also agree with the majority’s more specific
analysis of that duty * * * , including its references to the commissioners’
comment to

the U.L.T.A., as well as those to Wheeler and other
decisions of this court.

On the record presently before us, however, I cannot see any
support for the master’s finding that the lenders here failed to exercise due

diligence as we have defined that term. I would remand the
case to the superior court for further findings of fact.

Specifically, the master made no findings regarding what an
“owner... voluntarily selling his land” would have done that the lenders here

did not do, in order to obtain a fair price. * * *

Although the report nowhere states specifically what the
lenders should have done, its clear implication is that they should have made a

higher bid at the foreclosure sale.

There is no authority for such a conclusion. The mortgagee’s
fiduciary duty extends only to its role as a seller. Once the mortgagee has

exerted every reasonable effort to obtain a fair price
(which may sometimes include setting an upset price and adjourning the sale if
no bidder

meets that price), it has no further obligation in its role
as a potential buyer.

As the majority notes, a low price is not of itself
sufficient to invalidate a foreclosure sale, unless the price is “so low as to
shock the judicial

conscience.” The price here was clearly not that low. Cf.
Shipp Corp., Inc. v. Charpilloz, 414 So.2d 1 122, 1124 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.
1982) (bid of

$1.1 million was not grossly inadequate compared to a market
value of between $2.8 and $3.2 million).

Because it is unclear whether the master applied the correct
standard regarding the mortgagee’s duty, and because the record as presently

constituted cannot support a determination that the lenders
violated that standard, I respectfully dissent.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The duty of the mortgagee to obtain a fair price creates
a right running in favor of the defaulting mortgagor. Might it create a similar
right in

others? In DeLellis v. Burke, 598 A. 2 d 203 (N.H. 1991 ),
the New Hampshire Supreme Court declined to extend the fiduciary duty of the
mortgagee

recognized in _Murphy_ to other creditors of the mortgagor.

```



818



```

2 .What is the minimum the mortgagee could have done to
avoid liability here? Which is likely to be the better approach: A rule
spelling out which

procedures are sufficient (a safe harbor, if you will)? Or
an ex post standard? Or some combination of the two? What exactly does it mean
to obtain a

“fair” price for property at a judicial sale? The concept of
“fair market value” is well developed in the context of eminent domain: It is
the value that a

willing buyer would pay a willing seller for similar
property in an arm’s length transaction. See Chapter X, Part C. The court
indicates that a “fair” price

can be less than fair market value, but exactly how close it
must be is left pretty vague.

3 .Even if a court sides with the mortgagor in a case like
_Murphy_ , mortgagors with substantial equity would be well-advised to try to
sell the

property themselves, if at all possible. The mortgagor is
likely to get a much better price than the lender, even if spurred by the
threat of _Murphy_ - style

litigation. Consider the Murphys. If they sell on their own,
they can give clean title to the purchaser, and they should realize the fair
market value. But if

the property is sold by the lender through foreclosure, it
will be subject to any common law or statutory rights of redemption that the
Murphys have,

which means it will sell at a substantial discount from its
market value. The Murphys selling the house themselves thus looks like a
win-win proposition:

The lender gets its money back without incurring the costs
of foreclosure, and the Murphys get to pocket the full amount of their equity
in the house

without having to spend time and money suing the lender.
Given that the Murphys appear to have significant equity in the house beyond
the mortgage

balance, why didn’t they follow this course of action once
it became clear that they would otherwise lose the house? They appear to be
unwilling to take

action themselves, preferring to sit and watch while the
mortgagee sells their home at the foreclosure sale. How unusual do you suppose
this response is

for a family in financial crisis? If mortgagees have a
fiduciary duty to try to get a “fair” price for the property through a judicial
foreclosure sale, should

mortgagors have a duty not to destroy value by doing nothing
to prevent property with positive equity from going to foreclosure?

4 .There are substitutes to the mortgage for providing
security in the transfer of real estate. Probably the most commonly encountered
substitute is

the land sale contract (or installment sale contract),
considered in the next case. One reason to use a substitute like the land sale
contract is to avoid the

many restrictions on mortgages and mortgage foreclosures
imposed by legislatures and courts over the years. As _Murphy_ suggests, these
restrictions add

to the costs and risks of using mortgages. Another reason is
to provide credit to persons who present an especially high risk of default.
Land sale

contracts are often used to finance a purchase of real
estate when the prospective purchaser is unable to obtain financing from a bank
or other

professional lending institution, either because credit
markets are tight or the purchaser is a very poor credit risk. In these
circumstances, the seller may

elect to finance the sale him- or herself, by using a land
sale contract.

■
HUNTER, JUSTICE. Petitioners seek transfer to this Court as a result of an
adverse ruling by the Court of Appeals. Plaintiff-respondents originally

brought suit to obtain possession of certain real estate
through the enforcement of a forfeiture clause in a land sale contract.
Plaintiff-respondents

suffered a negative judgment, from which they appealed. The
Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the defendant-petitioners had breached
the

contract and that the plaintiff-respondents had not waived
their right to [enforce] the forfeiture provisions of the contract.

In December of 1958, Mary Burkowski, as vendor, entered into
a land sale contract with Charles P. Marshall and Agnes P. Marshall, as

vendees. The contract provided for the sale of certain real
estate for the sum of $36,000.00, payable as follows:

$500.00, at the signing, execution and delivery of this
contract, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged; $500.00 or more on or

before the 25th day of December, 1958, and $2500.00 or more
on or before the 15th day of January, 1960, and $2500.00 or more on or

before the 15th day of January of each and every year
thereafter until the balance of the contract has been fully paid, all without

interest and all without relief from valuation and
appraisement laws and with attorney fees.

The contract also contained a fairly standard section which
provided for the treatment of prepayments—but which the Court of Appeals

found to be of particular importance. It provided as
follows:

Should Vendees have made prepayments or paid in advance of
the payments herein required, said prepayments, if any, shall at any

time thereafter be applied in lieu of further principal
payments required as herein stated, to the extent of such prepayments only.

The following is the forfeiture/liquidated damages provision
of the land sale contract:

It is further agreed that if any default shall be made in
the payment of said purchase price or any of the covenants and/or conditions

herein provided, and if any such default shall continue for
30 days, then, after the lapse of said 30 days’ period, all moneys and

payments previously paid shall, at the option of the Vendor
without notice or demand, be and become forfeited and be taken and

retained by the Vendor as liquidated damages and thereupon
this contract shall terminate and be of no further force or effect; provided,

however, that nothing herein contained shall be deemed or
construed to prevent the Vendor from enforcing specific performance of this

agreement in the event of any default on the part of the
Vendees in complying, observing

#820

and performing any of the conditions, covenants and terms
herein contained * * *. (Emphasis added.)

The vendor, Mary Burkowski, died in 1963. The plaintiffs in
this action are the assignees (under the vendor’s will) of the decedent’s

interests in the contract. They received their assignment
from the executrix of the estate of the vendor on June 27, 1968. One year after
this

assignment, several of the assignees filed their complaint
in this action alleging that the defendants had defaulted through non-payment.

The schedule of payments made under this contract was shown
by the evidence to be as follows:

Date Amount Paid

Total of

Paid Principal

12/1/1958 $ 500.00 $ 500.00

12/25/1958 500.00 1,000.00

3/26/1959 5,000.00 6,000.00

4/5/1960 2,500.00 8,500.00

5/23/1961 2,500.00 1 1,000.00

4/6/1962 2,500.00 13,500.00

1/15/1963 2,500.00 16,000.00

6/30/1964 2,500.00 18,500.00

2/15/1965 2,500.00 21,000.00

No payments have been made since the last one indicated
above—$15,000.00 remains to be paid on the original contract price.

In response to the plaintiff’s attempt to enforce the
forfeiture provision, the defendants raised the affirmative defense of waiver.
The

applicable rule is well established and was stated by the
Court of Appeals as follows:

Where a contract for the sale and purchase of land contains
provisions similar to those in the contract in the case at bar, the vendor may

waive strict compliance with the provisions of the contract
by accepting overdue or irregular payments , and having so done, equity

requires the vendor give specific notice of his intent that
he will no longer be indulgent and that he will insist on his right of
forfeiture

unless the default is paid within a reasonable and specified
time. (Emphasis added.) * * *

It follows that where the vendor has not waived strict
compliance by acceptance of late payments, no notice is required to enforce its
provisions.

In essence, the Court of Appeals found that there was no
waiver because the vendors were obligated to accept prepayment, and, “the

#821

payments made, although irregular in time and amount, were
prepayments on the unpaid balance through and including the payment due on

January 15, 1965.” (289 N.E.2d at 771.) The Court concluded
that up to January 15, 1966, “the vendors waived no rights under the contract,

because they were obliged to accept prepayment.” (Id.) and
that, “(t)he vendors could not have insisted on forfeiture prior to January 15,
1966,

the date of the first missed payment.” (Id.) (We believe the
Court of Appeals miscalculated here; the vendors could not have insisted on
forfeiture

until January 16, 1968.)

If forfeiture is enforced against the defendants, they will
forfeit outright the sum of $21,000, or well over one-half the original
contract

price, as liquidated damages plus possession.

Forfeitures are generally disfavored by the law. In fact,
“... (e)quity abhors forfeitures and beyond any question has jurisdiction,
which it

will exercise in a proper case to grant relief against their
enforcement.” 30 C.J.S. Equity § 56 (1965) and cases cited therein. This
jurisdiction of

equity to intercede is predicated upon the fact that “the
loss or injury occasioned by the default must be susceptible of exact
compensation.” 30

C.J.S., supra. * * *

Paragraph 17 of the contract, supra, provides that all prior
payments “become forfeited and be taken and retained by the Vendor as

liquidated damages.” “Reasonable” liquidated damage
provisions are permitted by the law. See 22 Am.Jur., 2d Damages § 212 (1965).
However,

the issue before this Court, is whether a $21,000 forfeiture
is a “reasonable” measure of damages. If the damages are unreasonable, i.e., if
they

are disproportionate to the loss actually suffered, they
must be characterized as penal rather then compensatory. Under the facts of
this case, a

$21,000 forfeiture is clearly excessive. * * *

If we apply the specific equitable principle announced
above—namely, that the amount paid be considered in relation to the total
contract

price—we are compelled to conclude that the $21,000
forfeiture as liquidated damages is inconsistent with generally accepted
principles of

fairness and equity. The vendee has acquired a substantial
interest in the property, which, if forfeited, would result in substantial
injustice.

Under a typical conditional land contract, the vendor
retains legal title until the total contract price is paid by the vendee.
Payments are

generally made in periodic installments. Legal title does
not vest in the vendee until the contract terms are satisfied, but equitable
title vests in the

vendee at the time the contract is consummated. When the
parties enter into the contract, all incidents of ownership accrue to the
vendee. The

vendee assumes the risk of loss and is the recipient of all
appreciation in value. The vendee, as equitable owner, is responsible for
taxes. The

vendee has a sufficient interest in land so that upon sale
of that interest, he holds a vendor’s lien.

#822

This Court has held, consistent with the above notions of
equitable ownership, that a land contract, once consummated constitutes a
present

sale and purchase. The vendor “has, in effect, exchanged his
property for the unconditional obligation of the vendee, the performance of
which is

secured by the retention of the legal title.” Stark v.
Kreyling, 188 N.E. 680, 682 (Ind. 1934). The Court, in effect, views a
conditional land

contract as a sale with a security interest in the form of
legal title reserved by the vendor. Conceptually, therefore, the retention of
the title by the

vendor is the same as reserving a lien or mortgage.
Realistically, vendor-vendee should be viewed as mortgagee-mortgagor. To
conceive of the

relationship in different terms is to pay homage to form
over substance. * * *

It is also interesting to note that the drafters of the
Uniform Commercial Code abandoned the distinction between a conditional sale
and a

security interest. Section 1–201 of the UCC (IC 1971,
26–1–1–201) (Ind.Ann.Stat. § 19–1–201 (1964 Repl.)) defines “security interest”
as “an

interest in personal property or fixtures which secures
payment or performance of an obligation... retention or reservation of title by
a seller of

goods notwithstanding shipment or delivery to the buyer is
limited in effect to a reservation of ‘security interest.’ ” We can conceive of
no

rational reason why conditional sales of real estate should
be treated any differently.^1

A conditional land contract in effect creates a vendor’s
lien in the property to secure the unpaid balance owed under the contract. This
lien is

closely analogous to a mortgage—in fact, the vendor is
commonly referred to as an “equitable mortgagee.” In view of this
characterization of the

vendor as a lienholder, it is only logical that such a lien
be enforced through foreclosure proceedings. Such a lien “(has) all the
incidents of a

mortgage” D. S. B. Johnston Land Co. v. Whipple, 234 N.W.
59, 61 (N.D. 1930), one of which is the right to foreclose. * * *

The vendor’s interest clearly constitutes a “lien upon real
estate” and should, therefore, be treated as one. The basic foreclosure
statute—that

is for mortgages executed after July 1, 1957—provides for a
six-month period of redemption, commencing with the filing of the complaint.

Additionally, it establishes the procedures attendant to the
foreclosure sale. * * *

Forfeiture is closely akin to strict foreclosure—a remedy
developed by the English courts which did not contemplate the equity of

redemption. American jurisdictions, including Indiana, have,
for the

#823

most part, rejected strict foreclosure in favor of
foreclosure by judicial sale:

The doctrine of strict foreclosure developed in England at a
time when real property had, to a great extent, a fixed value; the vastly

different conditions in this country, in this respect, led
our courts to introduce modifications to the English rules of foreclosure.

Generally, in consonance with equity’s treatment of a
mortgage as essentially a security for the payment of the debt, foreclosure by

judicial sale supplanted strict foreclosure as the more
equitable mode of effectuating the mutual rights of the mortgagor and
mortgagee;

and there is at the present time, in the majority of the
American states, no strict foreclosure as developed by the English
courts—either

at law or in equity—by which a mortgagee can be adjudged
absolute owner of the mortgaged property. The remedy of the mortgagee is

by an action for the sale of the mortgaged premises and an
application of the proceeds of such sale to the mortgage debt, and although

usually called an action to foreclose, it is totally
different in its character and results from a strict foreclosure. The phrase
“foreclosure

of a mortgage” has acquired, in general, a different meaning
from that which it originally bore under the English practice and the

common law imported here from England. In this country, the
modern meaning of the term “foreclosure” denotes an equitable

proceeding for the enforcement of a lien against property in
satisfaction of a debt.

55 Am.Jur.2d, Mortgages, § 549 (1971). Guided by the above
principles we are compelled to conclude that judicial foreclosure of a land
sale

contract is in consonance with the notions of equity
developed in American jurisprudence. A forfeiture—like a strict foreclosure at
common law

—is often offensive to our concepts of justice and inimical
to the principles of equity. This is not to suggest that a forfeiture is an
inappropriate

remedy for the breach of all land contracts. In the case of
an abandoning, absconding vendee, forfeiture is a logical and equitable remedy.

Forfeiture would also be appropriate where the vendee has
paid a minimal amount on the contract at the time of default and seeks to
retain

possession while the vendor is paying taxes, insurance, and
other upkeep in order to preserve the premises. Of course, in this latter
situation, the

vendee will have acquired very little, if any, equity in the
property. However, a court of equity must always approach forfeitures with
great

caution, being forever aware of the possibility of
inequitable dispossession of property and exorbitant monetary loss. We are
persuaded that

forfeiture may only be appropriate under circumstances in
which it is found to be consonant with notions of fairness and justice under
the law.

#824

In other words, we are holding a conditional land sales
contract to be in the nature of a secured transaction, the provisions of which
are

subject to all proper and just remedies at law and in
equity.

Turning our attention to the case at hand, we find that the
vendor-assignees were seeking forfeiture, including $21,000 already paid on
said

contract as liquidated damages and immediate possession.
They were, in fact, asking for strict application of the contract terms at law
which we

believe would have led to unconscionable results requiring
the intervention of equity. “Equity delights in justice, but that not by
halves.” (Story,

Eq. Pl. § 72.) On the facts of this case, we are of the
opinion that the trial court correctly refused the remedy sought by the
vendor-assignees, but

in so refusing it denied all remedial relief to the
plaintiffs. Equity will “look upon that as done which ought to have been done.”
(Story, Eq.Jur.

§ 6 4(g)). Applying the foregoing maxims to the case at bar,
where such parties seek unconscionable results in such an action, equity will
treat the

subject matter as if the final acts and relief contemplated
by the parties were accomplished exactly as they should have been in the first
instance.

Where discretionary power is not exercised by a trial court,
under the mistaken belief that it was without this power, a remand and
direction by a

court of review is necessary and proper. This is not an
unwarranted interference with the trial court’s function. Upon appeal to this
Court, we

have the judicial duty to sua sponte direct the trial court
to apply appropriate equitable principles in such a case. Consistent with such
above-

stated rules, this Court has the undeniable authority to
remand with guidelines which will give substantial relief to plaintiffs under
their secured

interests and will prevent the sacrifice of the vendees’
equitable lien in the property.

For all of the foregoing reasons, transfer is granted and
the cause is reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a judgment of

foreclosure on the vendors’ lien, pursuant to Trial Rule
69(C) and the mortgage foreclosure statute (IC 1971, 32–8–16–1 (Ind.Stat.Ann.,
§ 3–

1801 (1968 Repl.))) as modified by Trial Rule 69(C). Said
judgment shall include an order for the payment of the unpaid principal balance
due

on said contract, together with interest at 8% per annum
from the date of judgment. The order may also embrace any and all other proper
and

equitable relief that the court deems to be just, including
the discretion to issue a stay of the judicial sale of the property, all
pursuant to the

provisions of Trial Rule 69(C). Such order shall be
consistent with the principles and holdings developed within this opinion. * *

■
PRENTICE, JUSTICE (concurring). I have some concern that our opinion herein
might be viewed by some as indicating an attitude of indifference

towards the rights of contract vendors. Such a view would
not be a true reflection.

Because the installment sales contract, with forfeiture
provisions, is a widely employed and generally accepted method of commerce in
real

estate in this state, it is appropriate that a vendee
seeking to avoid the

#825

forfeiture, to which he agreed, be required to make a clear
showing of the inequity of enforcement. In any given transaction anything short
of

enforcing the forfeiture provision may be a denial of equity
to the vendor. It has been set forth in the majority opinion that if the vendee
has little

or no real equity in the premises, the court should have no
hesitancy in declaring a forfeiture. It follows that if the vendee has
indicated his

willingness to forego his equity, if any, whether by mere
abandonment of the premises, by release or deed or by a failure to make a
timely

assertion of his claim, he should be barred from thereafter
claiming an equity.

If the court finds that forfeiture, although provided for by
the terms of the contract, would be unjust, it should nevertheless grant the
vendor

the maximum relief consistent with equity against a
defaulting vendee. In so doing, it should consider that, had the parties known
that the

forfeiture provision would not be enforceable, other
provisions for the protection of the vendor doubtlessly would have been
incorporated into

the agreement. Generally, this would require that the
transaction be treated as a note and mortgage with such provisions as are
generally included

in such documents customarily employed in the community by
prudent investors. Terms customarily included in such notes and mortgages but

frequently omitted from contracts include provisions for
increased interest during periods of default, provision for the acceleration of
the due date

of the entire unpaid principal and interest upon a default
continuing beyond a reasonable grace period, provisions for attorneys’ fees and
other

expenses incidental to foreclosure, for the waiver of relief
from valuation and appraisement laws and for receivers.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Do you think the court’s reaction to the suit to recover
possession would be different if the $ 21 , 000 paid by the Marshalls had been
characterized

as rent? $ 21 , 000 is nearly 60 percent of the purchase
price, which seems like a lot to forfeit. But another way of looking at the
situation is that the

$ 21 , 000 entitled the Marshalls to remain in possession
for nine years, which works out to $ 194 per month. Could the contract be
drafted in such a way

as to convert the payments to rent rather than speak of
forfeitures?

2 .By holding that the installment sales contract is a
mortgage, _Skendzel_ superimposes all the protections that legislatures and
courts have afforded

to mortgagors, plus any that the legislature might add
later, onto the land sale contract. Is this outcome advantageous to purchasers
of real estate with

poor credit ratings? One way to look at the situation is to
characterize mortgage foreclosure rules as a type of consumer protection law
which

legislatures and courts have determined should be afforded
to all persons who finance the purchase of land. From this perspective, the
land sale contract

looks like a loophole that should be closed. Another way of
looking at the situation is that the land sale contract is a type of financing
device employed

by sellers that comes into play primarily when purchasers
cannot obtain a mortgage from a bank or other professional lender. Sellers

```



826



```

may be willing to finance the transaction themselves in
these circumstances only if they have a very high degree of security in the
event of default. If

sellers under land sale contracts can get only the same
heavily-regulated foreclosure rights that professional mortgagees get, then
they may decline to

engage in self-financing. This might leave potential
purchasers with poor credit ratings with no option other than seeking financing
from sub-prime

mortgage lenders, where they will pay very high interest
rates. (Note by the way that the land sale contract in _Skendzel_ provides for
no interest.)

3 .The court questions why real estate should be treated any
differently from personal property in distinguishing (or not) between a
conditional

installment sale and a security interest. The UCC does not
prohibit the use of installment sales contracts; it merely recognizes that they
are a type of

security interest. See U.C.C. § 2 – 401. And there are
differences between personal property and real estate as sources of collateral.
For example, the

extensive self-help available to the holder of a security
interest in personal property (see Williams v. Ford Motor Credit Co., Chapter
IV) does not apply

to the holder of a real estate mortgage, who generally must
bring a judicial foreclosure action. Also, there is nothing like the equity of
redemption in the

personal property context. Are there nevertheless reasons to
welcome the court’s effort to look to the UCC for guidance?

4 .Why should parties in effect be forbidden to contract
around the protections afforded under judicial foreclosure? Why is following
the parties’

contract here to elevate form over substance: Weren’t the
parties trying to achieve a different result, i.e., to bypass foreclosure? Here
again the question

of the parties’ intent and its role is complicated. Under
the UCC and the approach the court here takes toward real estate mortgages,
parties will be taken

to have created a security interest if that is their intent.
But their intent is pigeonholed into the category of security interest. The
parties are simply not

allowed to contract for something like a security interest
but with different features, such as a heftier remedy. This pigeonholing
exercise can even crop

up in a regulatory context. See FCC v. NextWave Pers.
Commc’ns Inc., 537 U.S. 293 ( 2003 ) (holding that under the Bankruptcy Code
the FCC could

not achieve the effect of a security interest through
cancellation of a broadband PCS license for failure to pay after a spectrum
auction). Nevertheless,

parties do sometimes, particularly with high-loan-to-value
mortgages, contract for mortgage insurance, either with private companies, or
one of two

federal agencies, the Federal Housing Administration or the
Veterans Administration. Federal regulation plays a major role in this market.
See Quintin

Johnstone, Private Mortgage Insurance, 39 Wake Forest L.
Rev. 783 ( 2004 ).

5 .The court invokes the rule from contract law and equity
that liquidated damages are enforceable only if they are a reasonable
prediction of

actual damages; anything in excess of this is a “penalty”
and is unenforceable. This has long puzzled commentators. Why would
well-informed parties

mutually agree to a clause that shrinks the size of the
contractual pie? Why doesn’t the breacher simply “breach” the liquidated
damages provision as

well? See generally Michael Pressman, The Two-

```



827



```

Contract Approach to Liquidated Damages: A New Framework for
Exploring the Penalty Clause Debate, 7 Va. L. & Bus. Rev. 652 ( 2013 ).

6 .For another case holding that a similar contractual
arrangement (buyer transfers deed to lender and takes back a contract for deed
that provides

for a penalty-style forfeiture if there is a default) is
subject to the state statute on mortgages, see Mid-State Investment Corp. v.
O’Steen, 133 So. 2 d 455

(Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1961 ). For the older approach
upholding an installment land sale contract, see, e.g., Pease v. Baxter, 41 P.
899 (Wash. 1895 ). Notice

how the efforts of mortgagees to get around procedural
requirements for foreclosure associated with mortgages play a role in the
dynamic identified in

the following excerpt.

#### Carol M. Rose, Crystals and Mud in Property Law

```



40 STAN. L. REV. 577 , 577 – 79 , 583 – 85 ( 1988 ).



```

Property law, and especially the common law of property, has
always been heavily laden with hard-edged doctrines that tell everyone

exactly where they stand. Default on paying your loan
installments? Too bad, you lose the thing you bought and your past payments as
well.

Forget to record your deed? Sorry, the next buyer can
purchase free of your claim, and you are out on the street. Sell that house
with the leak in

the basement? Lucky you, you can unload the place without
having to tell the buyer about such things at all.

In a sense, hard-edged rules like these—rules that I call
“crystals”—are what property is all about. If, as Jeremy Bentham said long ago,

property is “nothing but a basis of expectation,” then
crystal rules are the very stuff of property: their great advantage, or so it
is commonly

thought, is that they signal to all of us, in a clear and
distinct language, precisely what our obligations are and how we may take care
of our

interests. Thus, I should inspect the property, record my
deed, and make my payments if I don’t want to lose my home to unexpected
physical,

legal, or financial impairments. I know where I stand and so
does everyone else, and we can all strike bargains with each other if we want
to

stand somewhere else.

Economic thinkers have been telling us for at least two
centuries that the more important a given kind of thing becomes for us, the
more

likely we are to have these hard-edged rules to manage it.
We draw these ever-sharper lines around our entitlements so that we know who
has

what, and so that we can trade instead of getting into the
confusions and disputes that would only escalate as the goods in question
became

scarcer and more highly valued.

At the root of these economic analyses lies the perception
that it costs something to establish clear entitlements to things, and we won’t

bother to undertake the task of removing goods from an
ownerless “commons” unless it is worth it to us to do so. What makes it worth
it?

Increasing scarcity of the resource, and the attendant
conflicts over it. To use the

#828

example given by Harold Demsetz, one of the most notable of
the modern economists telling this story, when the European demand for fur hats

increased demand for (and scarcity of) fur-bearing animals
among Indian hunters, the Indians developed a system of property entitlements
to the

animal habitat. Economic historians of the American West
tell a similar story about the development of property rights in various
minerals and

natural resources. Easy-going, anything-goes patterns of
appropriation at the outset came under pressure as competition for resources
increased,

and were finally superseded by much more sharply defined
systems of entitlement. In effect, as our competition for a resource raises the
costs of

conflict about it, those conflict costs begin to outweigh
the costs of taking it out of the commons and establishing clear property
entitlements. We

establish a system of clear entitlements so that we can
barter and trade for what we want instead of fighting.

The trouble with this “scarcity story” is that things don’t
seem to work this way, or at least not all the time. Sometimes we seem to
substitute

fuzzy, ambiguous rules of decision for what seem to be
perfectly clear, open and shut, demarcations of entitlements. I call this
occurrence the

substitution of “mud” rules for “crystal” ones.

Thus, in the examples with which I began, we find that, over
time, the straightforward common law crystalline rules have been muddied

repeatedly by exceptions and equitable second-guessing, to
the point that the various claimants under real estate contracts, mortgages, or

recorded deeds don’t know quite what their rights and
obligations really are. * * *

B.Of Mortgages and Mud

Early common law mortgages were very crystalline indeed.
They had the look of pawnshop transactions and were at least sometimes

structured as conveyances: I borrow money from you, and at
the same time I convey my land to you as security for my loan. If all goes
well, I

pay back my debt on the agreed “law day,” and you reconvey
my land back to me. But if all does not go well and I cannot pay on the
appointed

day, then, no matter how heartrending my excuse, I lose my
land to you and, presumably, any of the previous payments I might have made. As

the fifteenth century commentator Littleton airily
explained, the name “mortgage” derived from the rule that, if the debtor “doth
not pay, then the

land which he puts in pledge... is gone from him for ever,
and so dead.”

This system had the advantage of great clarity, but it
sometimes must have seemed very hard on mortgage debtors to the advantage of

scoundrelly creditors. Littleton’s advice about the
importance of specifying the precise place and time for repayment, for example,
conjures up

images of a wily creditor hiding in the woods on the
repayment day to frustrate repayment; presumably, the unfound creditor could
keep the

property. But by the seventeenth century, the intervention
of courts of equity had changed things. By the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, the

equity courts were regularly giving debtors

#829

as many as three or four “enlargements” of the time in which
they might pay and redeem the property before the final “foreclosure,” even
when

the excuse was lame. One judge explained that an equity
court might well grant more time even after the “final” order of “foreclosure
absolute,”

depending on the particular circumstances.

The muddiness of this emerging judicial remedy argued
against its attractiveness. Chief Justice Hale complained in 1672 that, “[b]y
the

growth of Equity on Equity, the Heart of the Common Law is
eaten out, and legal Settlements are destroyed;... as far as the Line is given,
Man

will go; and if an hundred Years are given, Man will go so
far, and we know not whither we shall go.”^40 Instead of a precise and clear
allocation

of entitlements between the parties, the “equity of
redemption” and its unpredictable foreclosure opened up vexing questions and
uncertainties:

How much time should the debtor have for repayment before
the equitable arguments shifted to favor the creditor? What sort of excuses did
the

debtor need? Did it matter that the property, instead of
dropping in the lap of the creditor, was sold at a foreclosure sale?

But as the courts moved towards muddiness, private parties
attempted to bargain their way out of these costly uncertainties and to
reinstate a

crystalline pattern whereby lenders could get the property
immediately upon default without the costs of foreclosure. How about a separate
deal

with the borrower, for example, whereby he agrees to convey
an equitable interest to the lender in case of default? Nothing doing, said the
courts,

including the United States Supreme Court, which in 1878
stated flatly that a mortgagor could not initially bargain away his “equity of

redemption.”^45 Well, then, how about an arrangement whereby
it looks as if the lender already owns the land, and the “borrower” only gets
title

if he lives up to his agreement to pay for it by a certain
time? This seemed more promising: In the 1890s California courts thought it
perfectly

correct to hold the buyer to his word in such an
arrangement, and to give him neither an extension nor a refund of past
payments. By the 1960s,

however, they were changing their minds about these
“installment land contracts.” After all, these deals really had exactly the
same effect as the

old-style mortgages—the defaulting buyer could lose
everything if he missed a payment, even the very last payment. Human vice and
error

seemed to put the crystal rule in jeopardy: In a series of
cases culminating with a default by a “willful but repentant” little old lady
who had

stopped paying when she mistakenly thought that she was
being cheated, the California Supreme Court decided to treat these land
contracts as

mortgages in disguise.^48 It gave the borrower “relief from
forfeiture”—a time to reinstate the installment contract or get back her past
payments.

#830

With mortgages first and mortgage substitutes later, we see
a back-and-forth pattern: crisp definition of entitlements, made fuzzy by

accretions of judicial decisions, crisped up again by the
parties’ contractual arrangements, and once again made fuzzy by the courts.
Here we see

private parties apparently following the “scarcity story” in
their private law arrangements: when things matter, the parties define their
respective

entitlements with ever sharper precision. Yet the courts
seem at times unwilling to follow this story or to permit these crystalline
definitions, most

particularly when the rules hurt one party very badly. The
cycle thus alternates between crystal and mud. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Are we destined to cycle between crystals and mud in all
areas? In the area of mortgages? Rose emphasizes the role that courts have
played in

“muddying up” mortgage law, especially because they see
disputes arise individually and ex post. On the other hand, according to some
scholars, it has

been legislatures responding to populist pressures during
economic downturns that have provided relief from the stringency of mortgage
law. See, e.g.,

A.H. Feller, Moratory Legislation: A Comparative Study, 46
Harv. L. Rev. 1061 ( 1933 ); Robert H. Skilton, Developments in Mortgage Law
and

Practice, 17 Temp. L.Q. 315 ( 1943 ); see also, e.g.,
Sheldon Tefft, The Myth of Strict Foreclosure, 4 U. Chi. L. Rev. 575 ( 1937 ).
Interestingly, in the

Colonial period and the early Republic, exemptions that had
protected real property from creditors in England (in the interest of
maintaining social

position), were removed in favor of commercial interests, a
development that led to lower interest rates, the rise of a market in land, and
greater

availability of capital for economic development. Claire
Priest, Credit Nation: Property Laws and Institutions in Early America ( 2021
).

2 .If some equilibrium between crystals and mud is possible,
what is the optimal mix of the two? Does one’s answer depend somewhat on who is

expected to figure things out? What exactly does it mean for
mortgage law to be “muddy?” Sometimes a contrast is drawn between rules, in
which

decisions are made ex ante, and standards, which give
discretion ex post. See, e.g., Louis Kaplow, Rules Versus Standards: An
Economic Analysis, 42

Duke L.J. 557 , 568 – 88 ( 1992 ). At other times, emphasis
is placed on the amount of information required to make a decision under a rule
(minimal)

versus a standard (lots). See, e.g., Frederick Schauer,
Playing by the Rules ( 1991 ); Henry E. Smith, The Language of Property: Form,
Context, and

Audience, 55 Stan. L. Rev. 1105 ( 2003 ). Recall the
discussion of minor building encroachments in Chapter IV, where one approach (
_Pile v. Pedrick_ )

might be interpreted as laying down a bright-line rule to
provide clear incentives for future actors and another ( _Golden Press v.
Rylands_ ) assesses a wider

range of contextual information in order to minimize the
costs from mistakes committed in the past. Is the tension between these
approaches the same as

the dynamic described by Rose in the context of mortgage
foreclosure? How about the role of courts of equity? What role should notions
of

disproportionate hardship play? Why does equity abhor a
forfeiture, as the saying goes? See Henry E. Smith, Equity as Meta-Law, 130
Yale L.J. 105 ,

```



831



```

1108 – 10 ( 2021 ) (arguing that interventions of equity can
lead to stable “sedimentation”).

3 .Recall the _numerus clausus_ principle, which we explored
in Chapter V. One aspect of the principle is that the legislature has primary

responsibility for modifying the list of basic property
forms. Does the history of foreclosure as described by Rose conform to this
expectation? At least

aspirationally, even old equity courts were supposed to
exercise extra caution to avoid undoing the law and its attendant
predictability where property

rights are concerned. Charles Grey, The Boundaries of the
Equitable Function, 20 Am. J. Legal Hist. 192 ( 1976 ). How much of the
muddying here has

consequences for third parties, through the in rem aspect of
property? In her article, Rose finds the same cycle of crystals and mud with
respect to land

records, which, as we shall see in the next Chapter, present
notice issues, often involving mortgages.

Walter Dendy Sadler, A Little Mortgage

Mortgages and the Financial Crisis of 2007 – 08

The financial crisis of 2007–08 and the deep recession that
followed put a spotlight on mortgages and their significance for the economy.

Mortgages played a critical role in causing the crisis and
were associated with some of the most painful effects in its aftermath.

Everyone agrees that mortgages, or more accurately, the
mortgage market, were central to the causes of the crisis. But the features of
the

mortgage market that were most critical remain a matter of
controversy.

The financial meltdown was precipitated by the bursting of
the U.S. housing bubble starting in 2006–07 and the steep decline in market

#832

prices for housing that followed. Many properties that had
been purchased with borrowed funds secured by mortgages were “underwater,”

meaning the current market value of the property was less
than the remaining balance owed under the mortgage indebtedness.

One reason so many loans were underwater was that, in the
period leading up to the crisis, lenders had become increasingly aggressive in

promoting loans with minimal down payments. Managers of
financial institutions ignored reasonable ex ante estimations of risk, in part
because

their compensation packages promoted decisions in favor of
taking on these underestimated risks. There is less agreement on why. It is
doubtful

that there was a sudden upsurge in “greed” or some other
change in human nature in the years leading up to 2007. But there is no
shortage of

other more plausible candidates for factors that contributed
to the mortgage mess.

Government policy did a lot to foster the climate of
excessive risk-taking during the housing bubble. The faulty regulatory and
policy

environment had (and to a large extent still has) a housing
aspect and a banking aspect. American housing policy has long been highly
focused

on promoting home ownership, going back to at least the
1920s. This pro-ownership policy has expressed itself in myriad ways, from the

mortgage interest tax deduction to federally sponsored home
mortgage insurance. In response to the widespread distress in housing markets
in

the Great Depression, the federal government created
agencies such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). In
1968 Fannie

Mae was changed from being a government agency to a
nominally private but implicitly (now explicitly) federally backed enterprise
(with a

spin-off, the Government National Mortgage Association, or
Ginnie Mae, remaining a government agency). As a government sponsored

enterprise (GSE) it was later joined in 1970 by the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). The GSEs purchase mortgages,

especially those insured by the Federal Housing
Administration (FHA), thereby allowing banks to extend more loans. They also
repackage and

sell mortgages to the markets as mortgage-backed securities
(MBSs, about which more below).

Starting in the early 19 90s amid accusations that banks
were redlining (a term referring to a practice of shunning poor and minority
areas

for making loans), Fannie Mae teamed up with advocacy
organizations to promote more lending to minority, low- and moderate-income
home

purchasers. Over time this entailed a push for lower lending
standards in the subprime market. See Gretchen Morgenson & Joshua Rosner,

Reckless Endangerment: How Outsized Ambition, Greed, and
Corruption Led to Economic Armageddon (2011). Underwriting standards became

not only lax but sloppy, and allegations of predatory
lending and outright fraud, notably but not exclusively by major culprits like
Countrywide,

ensued. See, e.g., Katherine Porter, Misbehavior and Mistake
in Bankruptcy Mortgage Claims, 87 Tex. L. Rev. 121 (2008).

#833

During the period the housing bubble was inflating, credit
was indeed cheap as the Federal Reserve kept interest rates lower than its

traditional rules of thumb would have indicated. One theory
is that as income distribution has become more unequal in a changing economy,

policy makers have found it convenient to paper over the
resulting tensions with cheap credit. At the same time, major trading partners
of the

United States like China and Germany pursued policies
promoting export-led growth; the Chinese government in particular borrowed from
its

own citizens to make loans to U.S. borrowers to encourage
spending, further driving down interest rates. See Raghuram G. Rajan, Fault
Lines:

How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy
(2010). Bank regulations permitted lower capital requirements than were
advisable,

and encouraged overreliance on credit agency ratings
(Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s, Fitch); see also Paul G. Mahoney, Deregulation
and the

Subprime Crisis, 104 Va. L. Rev. 235 (2018) (arguing that
macroeconomic policy leading to interest rate risk rather than easing
regulation on

banking made the crisis possible). The regulatory
environment made these ratings key to whether various regulated entities like
pension funds

could hold securities and how much, which caused great
pressure on the agencies to overrate securities.

Once the bubble got going, it took on a life of its own, as
is the nature of bubbles. Economists find bubbles difficult to study because
they

appear to involve irrational behavior. On the other hand, it
can be individually rational to ride a bubble upward, especially when monetary
and

regulatory policy is aimed at pumping up asset markets.

Enter financial engineering, which added fuel to the fire.
The first innovation in the area of mortgage financing was the collateralized
debt

obligation (CDO). A CDO combines property forms like the
trust (Chapter V) and, in many cases, mortgages. A CDO starts with a special

purpose entity (SPE), which is a limited partnership or
other limited liability organization that holds mortgages and then issues bonds
based on

their cash flow or market value. The bonds are structured
into seniority tranches. Say an SPE holds 1,000 mortgages. The highest tranche
gets

paid first (from the payments generated by the cream of the
1,000), the second is paid next, all the way down to the last tranche, which is
an

equity-like residual claim. The theory was that the
underlying loans might be risky but the highest tranche would be very safe, and
so eligible for

the highest credit rating, and the credit rating agencies
duly obliged with high ratings for the higher tranches of very dubious
collections of loans.

The problem was that the risk of the underlying loans was
more correlated than they were being treated as being, while the possibility of
a

general downturn in housing (leading to correlated default)
was underestimated. But the policies promoting overinvestment in housing and

overly cheap credit along with the market’s expectation that
the GSEs were at the ready to buy a significant chunk of mortgages led lenders,

investors, and home buyers all to count

#834

on rising home prices. As long as home prices kept rising,
the musical chairs could continue. Global CDO issuance reached $481.6 billion
by

2007 (and crashed to just $4.3 billion by 2009).

Later in the bubble, leverage increased through more
esoteric devices, such as the credit default swap (CDS). A CDS can be thought
of as

an insurance policy, and started being used to insure CDOs.
A CDS is a derivative because its value depends on or derives from the value of
a

referent asset, in this case, CDOs themselves. CDSs could be
used to insure CDO exposure, or they could be used to take on even greater
risk.

CDOs remove the need for lenders or issuers of the
securities to retain any interest in the loans, even indirectly, and CDSs allow
one to dispense

with the underlying assets altogether. Thus, CDSs could be
used to create synthetic CDOs, which are like CDOs without the ownership of the

underlying components of a regular CDO. Outstanding CDSs had
a notional amount of $62.2 trillion by the end of 2007.

Then the bubble burst. The defaults came in waves, involving
not just subprime borrowers but also so-called Alt-A loans, which dispensed

with traditional documentation and allowed smaller down
payments. (In what should have been a sign of things to come, Alt-A loans were

colloquially referred to at the time as “liar loans.”)
Defaults were also precipitated as teaser rates and adjustable rate mortgages
(ARMs) adjusted

upward just as housing values were tanking. As long as asset
values were expected to rise, the possibility of refinancing when the time came

would make such loans attractive, but once the bubble burst
such loans became toxic. The problems spread through the financial sector in
late

2007 and 2008. After early warning signs in 2007 when some
subprime lenders went bankrupt, 2008 saw even more high-profile failures of

financial institutions with exposure to the mortgage market.
After bailing out Bear Stearns, which had been highly exposed to CDOs and CDSs,

the government refused to bail out Lehman Brothers (which
had not prepared for bankruptcy, making its mess much worse), and the stock
market

crashed, leading to massive bailouts of financial firms and
even car makers. For a variety of perspectives, see, e.g., Timothy F. Geithner,
Stress

Test: Reflections on Financial Crises (2014); Alan S.
Blinder, After the Music Stopped: The Financial Crisis, the Response, and the
Work Ahead

Future (2010); Charles Calomiris, The Subprime Turmoil:

Could better regulations have prevented the problem and if
so what kind of regulations are needed? Regulatory failure is clearly a large
part

of the story of the rise and subsequent bursting of the
housing bubble and the financial crisis that it provoked. Some blame the
failure of the

#835

government to prevent the use of subprime and Alt-A
mortgages, CDOs, and CDSs directly. But the question is which instruments
should be

allowed under which circumstances. Others argue that
homeowners should be required to keep a certain minimal level of equity in
their home.

See Ryan Bubb & Prasad Krishnamurthy, Regulating Against
Bubbles: How Mortgage Regulation Can Keep Main Street and Wall Street Safe—

from Themselves, 163 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1539 (2015).
Historically, lenders required a down payment of 20 percent of the purchase
price. During the

housing bubble, this was cast aside in favor of 5 percent or
zero percent, or in a few cases even negative equity (taking out a mortgage
larger than

the appraised value of the property), which of course meant
that many of these borrowers were already under water when the bubble burst.

Curiously, this is one of the few reforms not incorporated
or even encouraged in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection

Act of 2010 , presumably because it would make it harder for
low-income families to purchase homes (or would force higher-income families to

purchase smaller homes). Not surprisingly, 5 percent down
payment loans have now reappeared in the marketplace.

Rather than restricting borrowers, the post-crisis reform
effort has focused on banks. Certainly, bank regulators before the crisis
allowed

banks to be undercapitalized given the risks they were
taking on, and stiffened capital requirements are likely part of the solution.
Among its

many changes to the financial system, the Dodd-Frank Act
increased capital requirements for institutions that present officially
designated

“systemic risk” (otherwise known as “too big to fail”).
Faulty corporate governance regulation also contributed to the lack of
shareholder

oversight over banks’ activities in the bubble period. And
allowing financial institutions to keep many of the exotic mortgage-related
securities

off their balance sheets made the problem even larger than
it would have been otherwise.

Another issue that emerged from the financial crisis was the
contribution of complexity to systemic financial risk. When the bubble burst,

investors had little knowledge of the contents of many
financial instruments. This uncertainty created panic and liquidity problems.
In creating

complex instruments, might there be complexity
externalities, along the lines that the numerus clausus (Chapter V) is meant to
prevent in the

basic property forms? Might we need a numerus clausus in
finance? Or might it be that the common law’s suspicion of secret liens has
been too

much watered down in financial markets, leading to
instability and eventual crash? See, e.g., Jonathan C. Lipson, Secrets and
Liens: The End of

Notice in Commercial Finance Law, 21 Emory Bankr. Dev. J.
421 (2005); Michael Simkovic, Secret Liens and the Financial Crisis of 2008, 83

Am. Bankr. L.J. 253 (2009). If so, why did the financial
industry create the complexity in the first place? In a bubble atmosphere,
prospective

purchasers are less concerned with complexity and secret
liens, because these only become problems in bad states of the world. As long
as asset

#836

prices are expected to keep rising, there appears to be no
need to worry. See Kenneth Ayotte & Patrick Bolton, Covenant Lite Lending,
Liquidity,

and Standardization of Financial Contracts, in Research
Handbook on the Economics of Property Law 174 (Kenneth Ayotte & Henry E.
Smith

eds., 201 1); see also Xavier Freixas, Luc Laeven &
José-Luis Peydró, Systemic Risk, Crises, and Macroprudential Regulation (2015);

Perils of Fragmentation and Reckless Innovation, 125 Harv.
L. Rev. 1799 (2012).

The painful effects of the financial crisis and recession
were many, including high unemployment, slow economic growth, and a prolonged

period of ultra-low interest rates, which harmed retirees
dependent on earnings from savings, insurance companies, and pension funds. But
one

of the most significant adverse effects was the explosion of
foreclosures as those who lost their jobs could not make the payments and some
who

found themselves with underwater mortgages simply stopped
paying in order to rid themselves of what appeared to be a losing proposition.

Designing a mortgage relief program is no simple task,
especially if one seeks to target help to those who can avoid default without
encouraging

those who can pay from engaging in strategic default. The
federal government’s principal program, the Home Affordable Modification
Program

(HAMP), was minimally successful in providing relief, see
Patricia A. McCoy, Barriers to Foreclosure Protection During the Financial
Crisis, 55

Ariz. L. Rev. 723 (2013), and there is evidence of strategic
default in response to the program, see Christopher Mayer et al., Mortgage

Modification and Strategic Default: Evidence from a Legal
Settlement with Countrywide, 104 Am. Econ. Rev. 2830 (2014). Proposals were

advanced to have local governments condemn underwater
mortgages, and retransfer them to other lenders at values reflecting the
reduced market

value of the property. See, e.g., Robert C. Hockett, It
Takes a Village: Municipal Condemnation Proceedings and Public/Private
Partnerships for

Mortgage Loan Modification, Value Preservation, and Local
Economic Recovery, 18 Stan. J. L. Bus. & Fin. 121 (2012). But these
proposals

encountered stiff resistance from the banking industry and
never got off the ground. As in past financial foreclosure crises, courts were
called on

to provide relief as well. As we will see in the following
case, foreclosures were litigated, and the sloppiness of mortgage lenders in
their

paperwork came back to haunt them.

■ GANTS,
J. After foreclosing on two properties and purchasing the properties back at
the foreclosure sales, U.S. Bank National Association

#837

(U.S.Bank), as trustee for the Structured Asset Securities
Corporation Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006–Z; and Wells Fargo

Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo), as trustee for ABFC 2005–OPT 1
Trust, ABFC Asset Backed Certificates, Series 2005–OPT 1 (plaintiffs), filed

separate complaints in the Land Court asking a judge to
declare that they held clear title to the properties in fee simple. We agree
with the judge

that the plaintiffs, who were not the original mortgagees,
failed to make the required showing that they were the holders of the mortgages
at the

time of foreclosure. As a result, they did not demonstrate
that the foreclosure sales were valid to convey title to the subject
properties, and their

requests for a declaration of clear title were properly
denied.

Procedural history. On July 5, 2007, U.S. Bank, as trustee,
foreclosed on the mortgage of Antonio Ibanez, and purchased the Ibanez

property at the foreclosure sale. On the same day, Wells
Fargo, as trustee, foreclosed on the mortgage of Mark and Tammy LaRace, and

purchased the LaRace property at that foreclosure sale.

In September and October of 2008, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo
brought separate actions in the Land Court under G.L. c. 240, § 6, which

authorizes actions “to quiet or establish the title to land
situated in the commonwealth or to remove a cloud from the title thereto.” The
two

complaints sought identical relief: (1) a judgment that the
right, title, and interest of the mortgagor (Ibanez or the LaRaces) in the
property was

extinguished by the foreclosure; (2) a declaration that
there was no cloud on title arising from publication of the notice of sale in
the Boston

Globe; and (3) a declaration that title was vested in the
plaintiff trustee in fee simple. U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo each asserted in its
complaint

that it had become the holder of the respective mortgage
through an assignment made after the foreclosure sale.

In both cases, the mortgagors—Ibanez and the LaRaces—did not
initially answer the complaints, and the plaintiffs moved for entry of

default judgment. In their motions for entry of default
judgment, the plaintiffs addressed two issues: (1) whether the Boston Globe, in
which the

required notices of the foreclosure sales were published, is
a newspaper of “general circulation” in Springfield, the town where the
foreclosed

properties lay. See G.L. c. 244, § 14 (requiring publication
every week for three weeks in newspaper published in town where foreclosed

property lies, or of general circulation in that town); and
(2) whether the plaintiffs were legally entitled to foreclose on the properties
where the

assignments of the mortgages to the plaintiffs were neither
executed nor recorded in the registry of deeds until after the foreclosure
sales. The

two cases were heard together by the Land Court, along with
a third case that raised the same issues.

On March 26, 2009, judgment was entered against the
plaintiffs. The judge ruled that the foreclosure sales were invalid because, in
violation

of G.L. c. 244, § 14, the notices of the foreclosure sales
named U.S. Bank (in the Ibanez foreclosure) and Wells Fargo (in the LaRace
foreclosure)

#838

as the mortgage holders where they had not yet been assigned
the mortgages. The judge found, based on each plaintiff’s assertions in its

complaint, that the plaintiffs acquired the mortgages by
assignment only after the foreclosure sales and thus had no interest in the
mortgages

being foreclosed at the time of the publication of the
notices of sale or at the time of the foreclosure sales.

The plaintiffs then moved to vacate the judgments. At a
hearing on the motions on April 17, 2009, the plaintiffs conceded that each

complaint alleged a postnotice, postforeclosure sale
assignment of the mortgage at issue, but they now represented to the judge that
documents

might exist that could show a prenotice, preforeclosure sale
assignment of the mortgages. The judge granted the plaintiffs leave to produce
such

documents, provided they were produced in the form they
existed in at the time the foreclosure sale was noticed and conducted. In
response, the

plaintiffs submitted hundreds of pages of documents to the
judge, which they claimed established that the mortgages had been assigned to
them

before the foreclosures. Many of these documents related to
the creation of the securitized mortgage pools in which the Ibanez and LaRace

mortgages were purportedly included.

The judge denied the plaintiffs’ motions to vacate judgment
on October 14, 2009, concluding that the newly submitted documents did not

alter the conclusion that the plaintiffs were not the
holders of the respective mortgages at the time of foreclosure. We granted the
parties’

applications for direct appellate review.

Factual background. We discuss each mortgage separately,
describing when appropriate what the plaintiffs allege to have happened and

what the documents in the record demonstrate.

The Ibanez mortgage. On December 1, 2005, Antonio Ibanez
took out a $103,500 loan for the purchase of property at 20 Crosby Street in

Springfield, secured by a mortgage to the lender, Rose
Mortgage, Inc. (Rose Mortgage). The mortgage was recorded the following day.
Several

days later, Rose Mortgage executed an assignment of this
mortgage in blank, that is, an assignment that did not specify the name of the
assignee.

The blank space in the assignment was at some point stamped
with the name of Option One Mortgage Corporation (Option One) as the assignee,

and that assignment was recorded on June 7, 2006. Before the
recording, on January 23, 20 06, Option One executed an assignment of the
Ibanez

mortgage in blank.

According to U.S. Bank, Option One assigned the Ibanez
mortgage to Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, which assigned it to Lehman Brothers

Holdings Inc., which then assigned it to the Structured
Asset Securities Corporation, which then assigned the mortgage, pooled with

approximately 1,220 other mortgage loans, to U.S. Bank, as
trustee for the Structured Asset Securities Corporation Mortgage Pass-Through

Certificates, Series 2006–Z. With this last assignment, the
Ibanez and other loans were pooled into a trust and converted into
mortgage-backed

#839

securities that can be bought and sold by investors—a
process known as securitization. * * *

According to U.S. Bank, the assignment of the Ibanez
mortgage to U.S. Bank occurred pursuant to a December 1, 2006, trust agreement,

which is not in the record. What is in the record is the
private placement memorandum (PPM), dated December 26, 2006, a 273-page,
unsigned

offer of mortgage-backed securities to potential investors.

* * * However, U.S. Bank did not provide the judge with any mortgage schedule

identifying the Ibanez loan as among the mortgages that were
assigned in the trust agreement.

On April 17, 2007, U.S. Bank filed a complaint to foreclose
on the Ibanez mortgage in the Land Court * * *. In the complaint, U.S. Bank

represented that it was the “owner (or assignee) and holder”
of the mortgage given by Ibanez for the property. * * * In June, 2007, U.S.
Bank

also caused to be published in the Boston Globe the notice
of the foreclosure sale required by G.L. c. 244, § 14. The notice identified
U.S. Bank

as the “present holder” of the mortgage.

At the foreclosure sale on July 5, 2007, the Ibanez property
was purchased by U.S. Bank, as trustee for the securitization trust, for
$94,350,

a value significantly less than the outstanding debt and the
estimated market value of the property. The foreclosure deed (from U.S. Bank,
trustee,

as the purported holder of the mortgage, to U.S. Bank,
trustee, as the purchaser) and the statutory foreclosure affidavit were
recorded on May 23,

2008. On September 2, 2008, more than one year after the
      sale, and more than five months after recording of the sale, American Home
      Mortgage

Servicing, Inc., “as successor-in-interest” to Option One,
which was until then the record holder of the Ibanez mortgage, executed a
written

assignment of that mortgage to U.S. Bank, as trustee for the
securitization trust. This assignment was recorded on September 11, 2008.

[The court then summarizes the similar history of the LaRace
mortgage, for which the best documentation of Wells Fargo’s holding of the

mortgage at the time of the foreclosure was an unexecuted
purchase and sale agreement (PSA) downloaded from the Internet, and “a schedule

that it represented identified the loans assigned in the
PSA, which did not include property addresses, names of mortgagors, or any
number that

corresponds to the loan number or servicing number on the
LaRace mortgage.”]

Discussion. The plaintiffs brought actions under G.L. c.
240, § 6, seeking declarations that the defendant mortgagors’ titles had been

extinguished and that the plaintiffs were the fee simple
owners of the foreclosed properties. As such, the plaintiffs bore the burden of
establishing

their entitlement to the relief sought. Sheriff’s Meadow
Found., Inc. v. Bay-Courte Edgartown, Inc., 516 N.E.2d 144 (Mass. 1987). To
meet this

burden, they were required “not merely to demonstrate

#840

better title... than the defendants possess, but... to prove
sufficient title to succeed in [the] action.” Id. * * *

Massachusetts does not require a mortgage holder to obtain
judicial authorization to foreclose on a mortgaged property. See G.L. c. 183,

§ 21; G.L. c. 244, § 14. * * * [A] mortgage holder can
foreclose on a property, as the plaintiffs did here, by exercise of the
statutory power of

sale, if such a power is granted by the mortgage itself.

Where a mortgage grants a mortgage holder the power of sale,
as did both the Ibanez and LaRace mortgages, it includes by reference the

power of sale set out in G.L. c. 183, § 21, and further
regulated by G.L. c. 244, §§ 1 1–17C. Under G.L. c. 183, § 21, after a
mortgagor defaults in

the performance of the underlying note, the mortgage holder
may sell the property at a public auction and convey the property to the
purchaser in

fee simple, “and such sale shall forever bar the mortgagor
and all persons claiming under him from all right and interest in the mortgaged

premises, whether at law or in equity.” Even where there is
a dispute as to whether the mortgagor was in default or whether the party
claiming to

be the mortgage holder is the true mortgage holder, the
foreclosure goes forward unless the mortgagor files an action and obtains a
court order

enjoining the foreclosure.

Recognizing the substantial power that the statutory scheme
affords to a mortgage holder to foreclose without immediate judicial oversight,

we adhere to the familiar rule that “one who sells under a
power [of sale] must follow strictly its terms. If he fails to do so there is
no valid

execution of the power, and the sale is wholly void.” Moore
v. Dick, 72 N.E. 967 (Mass. 1905). * * *

One of the terms of the power of sale that must be strictly
adhered to is the restriction on who is entitled to foreclose. The “statutory
power

of sale” can be exercised by “the mortgagee or his
executors, administrators, successors or assigns.” G.L. c. 183, § 21. Under
G.L. c. 244, § 14,

“[t]he mortgagee or person having his estate in the land
mortgaged, or a person authorized by the power of sale, or the attorney duly
authorized

by a writing under seal, or the legal guardian or
conservator of such mortgagee or person acting in the name of such mortgagee or
person” is

empowered to exercise the statutory power of sale. Any
effort to foreclose by a party lacking “jurisdiction and authority” to carry
out a

foreclosure under these statutes is void. * * *

For the plaintiffs to obtain the judicial declaration of
clear title that they seek, they had to prove their authority to foreclose
under the power

of sale and show their compliance with the requirements on
which this authority rests. Here, the plaintiffs were not the original
mortgagees to

whom the power of sale was granted; rather, they claimed the
authority to foreclose as the eventual assignees of the original mortgagees.
Under

the plain language of G.L. c. 183, § 21, and G.L. c. 244, §
14, the plaintiffs had the authority to exercise the power of sale contained in
the Ibanez

#841

and LaRace mortgages only if they were the assignees of the
mortgages at the time of the notice of sale and the subsequent foreclosure
sale.

The plaintiffs claim that the securitization documents they
submitted establish valid assignments that made them the holders of the Ibanez

and LaRace mortgages before the notice of sale and the
foreclosure sale. We turn, then, to the documentation submitted by the
plaintiffs to

determine whether it met the requirements of a valid
assignment.

Like a sale of land itself, the assignment of a mortgage is
a conveyance of an interest in land that requires a writing signed by the
grantor.

See G.L. c. 183, § 3; Saint Patrick’s Religious, Educ. &
Charitable Ass’n v. Hale, 116 N.E. 407, 408 (Mass. 1917). In a “title theory
state” like

Massachusetts, a mortgage is a transfer of legal title in a
property to secure a debt. See Faneuil Investors Group, Ltd. Partnership v.
Selectmen of

Dennis, 933 N.E.2d 91 8, 921–22 (Mass. 2010). Therefore,
when a person borrows money to purchase a home and gives the lender a mortgage,

the homeowner-mortgagor retains only equitable title in the
home; the legal title is held by the mortgagee. Where, as here, mortgage loans
are

pooled together in a trust and converted into
mortgage-backed securities, the underlying promissory notes serve as financial
instruments

generating a potential income stream for investors, but the
mortgages securing these notes are still legal title to someone’s home or farm
and

must be treated as such.

Focusing first on the Ibanez mortgage, U.S. Bank argues that
it was assigned the mortgage under the trust agreement described in the PPM,

but it did not submit a copy of this trust agreement to the
judge. The PPM, however, described the trust agreement as an agreement to be

executed in the future, so it only furnished evidence of an
intent to assign mortgages to U.S. Bank, not proof of their actual assignment.
Even if

there were an executed trust agreement with language of
present assignment, U.S. Bank did not produce the schedule of loans and
mortgages that

was an exhibit to that agreement, so it failed to show that
the Ibanez mortgage was among the mortgages to be assigned by that agreement.

Finally, even if there were an executed trust agreement with
the required schedule, U.S. Bank failed to furnish any evidence that the entity

assigning the mortgage—Structured Asset Securities
Corporation—ever held the mortgage to be assigned. The last assignment of the
mortgage

on record was from Rose Mortgage to Option One; nothing was
submitted to the judge indicating that Option One ever assigned the mortgage to

anyone before the foreclosure sale. Thus, based on the
documents submitted to the judge, Option One, not U.S. Bank, was the mortgage
holder at

the time of the foreclosure, and U.S. Bank did not have the
authority to foreclose the mortgage.

[The court went on to conclude that in the LaRace case the
documentation of the alleged completed assignment as of the date of the

foreclosure notice was insufficient.]

#842

We do not suggest that an assignment must be in recordable
form at the time of the notice of sale or the subsequent foreclosure sale,

although recording is likely the better practice. Where a
pool of mortgages is assigned to a securitized trust, the executed agreement
that assigns

the pool of mortgages, with a schedule of the pooled
mortgage loans that clearly and specifically identifies the mortgage at issue
as among those

assigned, may suffice to establish the trustee as the
mortgage holder. However, there must be proof that the assignment was made by a
party that

itself held the mortgage. A foreclosing entity may provide a
complete chain of assignments linking it to the record holder of the mortgage,
or a

single assignment from the record holder of the mortgage. *

The judge did not err in concluding that the securitization
documents submitted by the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that they were the

holders of the Ibanez and LaRace mortgages, respectively, at
the time of the publication of the notices and the sales. The judge, therefore,
did not

err in rendering judgments against the plaintiffs and in
denying the plaintiffs’ motions to vacate the judgments. * * *

We now turn briefly to three other arguments raised by the
plaintiffs on appeal. First, the plaintiffs initially contended that the
assignments

in blank executed by Option One, identifying the assignor
but not the assignee, not only “evidence[ ] and confirm[ ] the assignments that

occurred by virtue of the securitization agreements,” but
“are effective assignments in their own right.” But in their reply briefs they
conceded

that the assignments in blank did not constitute a lawful
assignment of the mortgages. Their concession is appropriate. We have long held
that a

conveyance of real property, such as a mortgage, that does
not name the assignee conveys nothing and is void; we do not regard an
assignment of

land in blank as giving legal title in land to the bearer of
the assignment.

Second, the plaintiffs contend that, because they held the
mortgage note, they had a sufficient financial interest in the mortgage to
allow

them to foreclose. In Massachusetts, where a note has been
assigned but there is no written assignment of the mortgage underlying the
note, the

assignment of the note does not carry with it the assignment
of the mortgage. Rather, the holder of the mortgage holds the mortgage in trust
for

the purchaser of the note, who has an equitable right to
obtain an assignment of the mortgage, which may be accomplished by filing an
action in

court and obtaining an equitable order of assignment. In the
absence of a valid written assignment of a mortgage or a court order of
assignment,

the mortgage holder remains unchanged. This common-law
principle was later incorporated in the statute enacted in 1912 establishing
the

statutory power of sale, which grants such a power to “the
mortgagee or his executors, administrators, successors or assigns,” but not to
a party

that is the equitable beneficiary of a mortgage held by
another. G.L. c. 183, § 21, inserted by St.1912, c. 502, § 6.

Third, the plaintiffs initially argued that postsale
assignments were sufficient to establish their authority to foreclose, and now
argue that

#843

these assignments are sufficient when taken in conjunction
with the evidence of a presale assignment. They argue that the use of postsale

assignments was customary in the industry, and point to
Title Standard No. 58(3) issued by the Real Estate Bar Association for
Massachusetts,

which declares: “A title is not defective by reason of...
[t]he recording of an Assignment of Mortgage executed either prior, or
subsequent, to

foreclosure where said Mortgage has been foreclosed, of
record, by the Assignee.” To the extent that the plaintiffs rely on this title
standard for

the proposition that an entity that does not hold a mortgage
may foreclose on a property, and then cure the cloud on title by a later
assignment of

a mortgage, their reliance is misplaced, because this
proposition is contrary to G.L. c. 183, § 21, and G.L. c. 244, § 14. If the
plaintiffs did not

have their assignments to the Ibanez and LaRace mortgages at
the time of the publication of the notices and the sales, they lacked authority
to

foreclose under G.L. c. 183, § 21, and G.L. c. 244, § 14,
and their published claims to be the present holders of the mortgages were
false. Nor

may a postforeclosure assignment be treated as a
preforeclosure assignment simply by declaring an “effective date” that precedes
the notice of

sale and foreclosure, as did Option One’s assignment of the
LaRace mortgage to Wells Fargo. Because an assignment of a mortgage is a
transfer

of legal title, it becomes effective with respect to the
power of sale only on the transfer; it cannot become effective before the
transfer.

However, we do not disagree with Title Standard No. 58(3)
that, where an assignment is confirmatory of an earlier, valid assignment made

prior to the publication of notice and execution of the
sale, that confirmatory assignment may be executed and recorded after the
foreclosure, and

doing so will not make the title defective. A valid
assignment of a mortgage gives the holder of that mortgage the statutory power
to sell after a

default regardless whether the assignment has been recorded.

* * * A confirmatory assignment, however, cannot confirm an assignment that was

not validly made earlier or backdate an assignment being
made for the first time. Where there is no prior valid assignment, a subsequent

assignment by the mortgage holder to the note holder is not
a confirmatory assignment because there is no earlier written assignment to
confirm.

In this case, based on the record before the judge, the
plaintiffs failed to prove that they obtained valid written assignments of the
Ibanez and

LaRace mortgages before their foreclosures, so the
postforeclosure assignments were not confirmatory of earlier valid assignments.

Finally, we reject the plaintiffs’ request that our ruling
be prospective in its application. A prospective ruling is only appropriate, in
limited

circumstances, when we make a significant change in the
common law. We have not done so here. The legal principles and requirements we
set

forth are well established in our case law and our statutes.
All that has changed is the plaintiffs’ apparent failure to abide

#844

by those principles and requirements in the rush to sell
mortgage-backed securities.

Conclusion. For the reasons stated, we agree with the judge
that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate that they were the holders of the
Ibanez

and LaRace mortgages at the time that they foreclosed these
properties, and therefore failed to demonstrate that they acquired fee simple
title to

these properties by purchasing them at the foreclosure sale.

Judgments affirmed.

■ CORDY,
J. (concurring, with whom BOTSFORD, J., joins). I concur fully in the opinion
of the court, and write separately only to underscore that

what is surprising about these cases is not the statement of
principles articulated by the court regarding title law and the law of
foreclosure in

Massachusetts, but rather the utter carelessness with which
the plaintiff banks documented the titles to their assets. There is no dispute
that the

mortgagors of the properties in question had defaulted on
their obligations, and that the mortgaged properties were subject to
foreclosure. Before

commencing such an action, however, the holder of an
assigned mortgage needs to take care to ensure that his legal paperwork is in
order.

Although there was no apparent actual unfairness here to the
mortgagors, that is not the point. Foreclosure is a powerful act with
significant

consequences, and Massachusetts law has always required that
it proceed strictly in accord with the statutes that govern it. As the opinion
of the

court notes, such strict compliance is necessary because
Massachusetts both is a title theory State and allows for extrajudicial
foreclosure. * * *

What is more complicated, and not addressed in this opinion,
because the issue was not before us, is the effect of the conduct of banks such

as the plaintiffs here, on a bona fide third-party purchaser
who may have relied on the foreclosure title of the bank and the confirmative

assignment and affidavit of foreclosure recorded by the bank
subsequent to that foreclosure but prior to the purchase by the third party,
especially

where the party whose property was foreclosed was in fact in
violation of the mortgage covenants, had notice of the foreclosure, and took no

action to contest it.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The judges here disapproved of the banks’ sloppiness and
the “rush” to securitization. At the same time, the opinion is rather
formalistic. Is an

invocation of formalism the best way to prevent the excesses
that led to the financial meltdown? Is there any claim the mortgagors were
misled because

of the sloppiness, or that they do not really owe the money
they have failed to pay? Is the invocation of formalism here a backdoor way of
declaring a

mortgage moratorium, something legislatures have often done
in response to widespread financial distress? Will delaying the process of
completing

foreclosures hasten the day when the housing market starts
to recover or postpone the recovery of that market?

#845

2 .A paper digging into the factual background of the case
argues that Ibanez was part of a fraud ring in Springfield and that the
appraisals at the

time of mortgaging many of his properties, including the one
here, were wildly high. Zachary K. Kimball, The Ibanez Property Ring: A
Surprising

Hidden Story Behind a Significant Foreclosure Lawsuit
(September 22 , 2015 ), [http://](http://) ssrn. com/ abstract = 268 4522. The
question then becomes how the

banks allowed this to happen. Does this call into question
the court’s approach? A law professor who was involved as an amicus in the
later stages of the

litigation says no: the case was not about Ibanez but about
the principles that should govern foreclosures. Adam Levitin, The Ibanez

org/ credit slips/ 2015 / 11 / the- ibanez- property- ring .html. Recall the
discussion of mortgage relief programs and strategic default.

Are courts better at policing individual behavior, by both
mortgagors and mortgagees, than at designing mortgage relief programs? If
Ibanez was not the

best candidate for relief, does that excuse the banks’
sloppiness or merely show how widespread it really was?

3 .Recall the Rose excerpt, supra, on the alternation of
mortgage law between crystals and mud, with widespread financial distress and

foreclosures being largely responsible for the turn to mud.
The financial crisis of 2007 – 08 and cases like _Ibanez_ , however, seem to
tell a different story.

Mortgage law, through the push for widespread securitization
of loans and the proliferation of innovative and hard-to-understand sub-prime
mortgages,

was becoming increasingly opaque (mud-like if you will)
during the run-up to the crisis. One response to mass foreclosures, at least
that reflected in

_Ibanez_ , was to demand a return to a more “crystalline”
version of mortgage law, where lenders are required strictly to follow
established rules. This

suggests that some kind of oscillation between crystals and
mud is endemic to mortgage law, but perhaps that there is no inherent
connection between

which set of interests—that of lenders or borrowers—is more
likely to be favored by crystals or mud.

4 .The court is at pains to say that recording the mortgages
would not be required in order for the assignee to be entitled to foreclose on
the

mortgage. But relativity of title does not save the banks
either. Why not? If the answer is that the statute and the case law require it,
is that a good idea?

How much protection for mortgagors do the “title theory” of
mortgages and the lack of recognition of equitable assignments afford? Would
the

conclusion the court reached here apply in a “lien theory”
state? When a note is assigned, the lien is presumed to be assigned along with
it. Restatement

(Third) of Property: Mortgages § 5. 4 (a) ( 1997 ).

5 .The concurrence brings up the issue of third-party
reliance. Those purchasing a property with a foreclosure in the chain of title
have some

reason to worry about the validity of the earlier transfer.
Would the foreclosed-upon mortgagor (Ibanez or LaRace) be able to assert the
invalidity of the

foreclosure sale? In a follow-on case to _Ibanez_ ,
_Bevilacqua v. Rodriguez_ , 955 N.E. 2 d 884 (Mass. 2011 ), the Massachusetts
high court held that a third-

party purchaser of property foreclosed with the defects in
_Ibanez_ —acquisition of the mortgage after the foreclosure—could not obtain
valid title.

```



846



```

In _Bevilacqua_ , the court believed that the invalidity of
the foreclosure sale was sufficiently reflected on the records to provide
inquiry notice. Will that

be true in all cases? We return to recording issues in the
next Chapter.

6 .The transfer of mortgages raises some additional systemic
issues. Rapid transfers of mortgages have been criticized, but to the extent
that

alienability of mortgages has the potential in a better
regulatory environment to increase the volume and accessibility of lending,
transfers should not be

prohibited outright. What has long stood as an obstacle to
transfers of mortgages is the creaky state of land records and the great
expense of recording.

To get around this, in 1993 mortgage lenders and related
government agencies—the Mortgage Bankers Association, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
Ginnie

Mae, the FHA, and the Department of Veteran Affairs—created
the Mortgage Electronic Registrations Systems, Inc. (MERS), which mortgage
lenders

and title insurance companies can pay a fee to enter as
members. MERS is structured as a company that serves as a trustee in a trust
arrangement where

legal ownership of the mortgage is with MERS and beneficial
ownership is with the member financial institution. In personam transfers of
mortgages

can happen between members of MERS without the need to
record those transfers (because MERS itself is the record owner before and
afterwards—

recall the material on trusts in Chapter VI). Assignments
are tracked internally with a standardized and stable tracking number
throughout the life of the

loan, but are not recorded in the local land records, and
are thus opaque to outsiders including borrowers. Whether MERS satisfies
various state

requirements for valid transfers (it would seem not to be a
problem in Massachusetts given the relevant dictum in _Ibanez_ ) is sometimes
an open

question. Compare Landmark Nat. Bank v. Kesler, 216 P. 3 d
158 (Kan. 2009 ) (upholding trial court’s denial of MERS’ motion to set aside a
default

judgment on grounds that MERS, being an agent and not an
interest holder or servicer, was not a necessary party); MERSCORP, Inc. v.
Romaine, 861

N.E. 2 d 81 (N.Y. 2006 ) (requiring the County Clerk to
record assignments where MERS was record holder of the mortgage) with Santarose
v. Aurora

Bank FSB, 2010 WL 2232819 (S.D. Tex.) (finding no
substantial likelihood of success on merits of claim that MERS lacked standing
to foreclose). See,

e.g., Donald J. Kochan, Certainty of Title: Perspectives
After the Mortgage Foreclosure Crisis on the Essential Role of Effective
Recording Systems, 66

Ark. L. Rev. 267 ( 2013 ); Gerald Korngold, Legal and Policy
Choices in the Aftermath of the Subprime and Mortgage Financing Crises, 60 S.C.

Foreclosure, Subprime Mortgage Lending, and the Mortgage Electronic
Registration System, 78 U. Cin.

L. Rev. 1359 , 1374 – 97 ( 2010 ). Relatedly, borrowers
increasingly do not deal with the original lender but with a mortgage servicer.
See Christopher K.

Odinet, Foreclosed: Mortgage Servicing and the Hidden
Structure of Honeownership in America ( 2019 ). And MERS in turn makes it
difficult to know

who actually holds the debt. In any event, MERS is a symptom
of the expense and delay with land records, which is one of the topics of the
next

Chapter.

***** Many notes, such as those in the typical residential
real estate transaction, provide for an “amortized” schedule of repayments.
Amortization is a payment scheme for paying a

predetermined sum plus interest over a fixed period of time
so that the principal is eliminated at the end of the period. Usually the
payments are equal in size, and each is comprised of

principal and interest such that each payment’s interest
component is the rate-based amount of interest on the principal amount before
that payment. The result is that early payments are

weighted more towards interest and later ones more towards
principal. As principal is paid off, the mortgagor builds up “equity” (short
for “equity of redemption”), to which we turn in the

next section.

(^1) In fact, the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws have
recognized the transparency of any such distinctions. Section 3 – 102 of the
Uniform Land Transactions Code (working draft of

first tentative draft) reads as follows:

This Article applies to security interests created by
contract, including mortgage... land sales contract... and any other lien or
title retention contract intended as security.

We believe this position is entirely consistent with the
evolving case law in the area.

## CHAPTER VIII

# TITLE RECORDS AND THE TRANSFER OF PROPERTY

We have seen in previous chapters how important it is for
those who assert property rights to let others know what exactly is being
asserted.

The rules of first possession, for example, are designed to
make clear to those who would potentially compete for a resource that the
resource

belongs to someone else. For ongoing ownership, markers like
boundary stones and name tags serve to put others on notice of ownership
claims.

Starting with the ancient civilizations, written records of
various sorts have also served to evidence ownership. With the collection of
these

records in a centralized location, those who might have some
interest in the state of a property’s title need only look up the information.

Title records are deeply intertwined with transfers of
property. Although persons other than potential purchasers might have reason to

consult title records, purchasers—broadly conceived to
include lenders—are the main users of title records. By investigating the state
of title

through the title records, a potential purchaser (usually
having employed an expert) can gain assurance at reasonable cost that he or she
is

acquiring what the seller claims to have for transfer.

Good title records promote transferability. The use of such
a system serves the collective interest of all potential sellers, as well as
the

individual interests of potential buyers. As a result, most
modern systems of records do more than act as repositories of information.
Instead, title

records (especially land records) carry with them legal
effect. In many systems, achieving an in rem effect and the ability to bind
third-party good

faith purchasers is only possible by filing one’s interests
in the public records. Some systems, such as those in Australia (the “Torrens”
system)

and Germany, explicitly strip out invalid claims and title
defects, thereby affording nearly conclusive legal title. Things are not quite
so tidy in

the United States, where almost all localities employ a
system of recordation more like France’s, but as we will see, various recording
acts and

doctrines make the system of land records essential to the
shape and scope of property that is actually transferred from one person to
another.

There is another sense in which transfer lies at the heart
of a system of property records: It is the possibility of transfer that makes
the state

of title more difficult to establish. If each owned thing
were assigned an owner who could not alienate it (with ownership going
indefeasibly to

the heirs or to the state upon death), property would be a
lot less complicated—and a lot less useful. In the following materials we begin
with

some general principles for establishing a valid transfer of
property

#848

designed to enhance the security of transfers. We then turn
to the bedrock principle that an owner can only convey what the owner owns, and
to

an important exception to this principle, in favor of good
faith purchasers. Finally we survey some systems of records of ownership in
various

resources, including most prominently land.

### A. TRANSFER AND ALIENABILITY

The power to transfer is considered an important attribute
of owner sovereignty. The power to transfer enhances owner autonomy, because it

permits the owner to shed responsibility for things that no
longer suit the owner’s wants or needs, and at the same time to acquire other
things

that may be better suited to the owner’s wants and needs.
Moreover, the power to transfer affords significant control to the owner, in
that the

owner is allowed in effect to appoint his or her successor
as the new owner of the asset—something not possible if the owner sheds
responsibility

by abandonment or destruction (see Chapter IV). The power to
transfer also promotes the efficient allocation of resources. If the current
owner is

not capable of extracting the most value from a resource (as
measured by the willingness of others to pay for the output generated by the
use of

the resource), then a transfer can be negotiated with
someone else who can perhaps do better. The process does not work perfectly of
course.

Transaction and information costs (and lack of
self-knowledge by underperforming owners) defeat many potential transfers. But
over time and

over a large range of things, free transferability probably
generates a higher level of socially desired output than can be obtained from
other

methods of managing resources. Finally, voluntary transfer
is undoubtedly a less conflict-prone method of hiring and firing the

gatekeeper/managers of resources than other methods of
changing managers. Adverse possession and eminent domain (or for that matter,
might-

makes-right) are other ways of changing managers, but each
has a tendency to generate litigation or worse. Voluntary transfer—where both
the

outgoing and the incoming manager are willing volunteers in
the transfer of owner sovereignty—tends to go much more smoothly.

As we saw in Chapter V, one way the law promotes
transferability of property is by putting severe limits on the ability of
owners to block

transfers, for example by trying to create restraints on
alienation or by creating contingent interests in property not certain to vest
within the

period of the Rule Against Perpetuities. This Chapter
focuses on ways in which the law actively seeks to promote transfer of
property.

Paradoxically, one way the law does this is by imposing some
additional constraints on what owners do when they transfer property. For

example, the law requires that owners provide adequate
evidence of a transfer of ownership, either by delivering the thing to the new
owner or by

executing an appropriate writing, and it provides powerful
incentives for owners to publicly record certain kinds of major transactions in

property—all in the interest of making it easier for future
transactions

#849

in the property to take place. A little bit of restriction
on the freedom on owners to transfer today generates a lot more transfers down
the road.

Transfers of property come in two basic types: exchanges
(quid pro quos), in which an owner relinquishes title to some owned thing in

exchange for a reciprocal transfer of some other thing
(including money); and gifts, in which an owner relinquishes title to some
owned thing in

favor of another person without explicitly receiving or
expecting to receive something in return. The law of exchanges of property is
bound up

with the law of contracts and is primarily studied in
courses on contracts. The law of gifts is bound up with the law of trusts and
estates and is

often studied in courses on these topics. Here we will
consider only selected topics in these areas that bear on the sovereign owner’s
power to

transfer her owned thing.

We begin with some rules designed to enhance the
transferability of assets by imposing certain requirements necessary to
establish a valid

transfer of some thing. Later, we turn to registration or
recording of rights.

### 1 .RULES DESIGNED TO ENHANCE TRANSFERABILITY

The law has long favored transferability of property. One
early landmark we briefly encountered in Chapter V was the Statute Quia

Emptores of 1290, which provided for the alienability of
land inter vivos. Feudal property systems did permit alienability but with
severe and

often confusing restrictions: Substituting one tenant for
another might impact the quality of the feudal services owed, especially if
they were in

kind, such as military service. The feudal incidents
themselves were abolished with the Statute of Tenures in 1660. By the same
token, livery of

seisin and its system of witnesses to a public act tended to
keep land transactions a local affair, in contrast to the modern systems of
land records

we will explore later in this Chapter. Restrictions on the
dead hand like the Rule Against Perpetuities and the abolition of the fee tail
were also

thought to promote alienability. In eighteenth-century
America the shift toward freer alienability also involved making property more
available to

the claims of creditors. Claire Priest, Credit Nation:
Property Laws and Institutions in Early America (2021). Common property, like a
village

grazing field, by contrast, was and is not fully alienable:
The use as a grazing commons is stable and long term, and sustainable use
depends on

keeping those with access relatively close-knit and not
allowing transfer to potential overusers. Common property remains important
today but it

lay at the heart of feudal systems. Many of the restrictions
designed to promote the stability of the feudal system were customary. The move
from

feudal to modern property systems involved a removal of many
of these restrictions and a generally more skeptical attitude toward custom. As

we have seen, standardization of property through the
numerus clausus principle was in part anti-feudal and designed to promote
alienability.

Ask yourself as we encounter land

#850

records in this Chapter how the numerus clausus works
together, or not, with a system of title records.

The Statute of Frauds

One doctrine designed to promote transferability requires
that certain important transfers of property be memorialized by a writing. The

most prominent example of such a rule, which will poke its
head up from time to time in these materials (although it is primarily covered
in the

course in contracts), is the Statute of Frauds. Originally
enacted by Parliament in 1677 under the title “An Act for Prevention of Frauds
and

Perjuryes,” 29 Car. II, c. 3, some version of the Statute of
Frauds is part of state law everywhere in the United States except in
Louisiana. It

contains several provisions of importance to the law of
property. Section one provides that interests in land, including leases, must
be “putt in

Writeing and signed by the parties soe making or creating
the same” or else they “shall have the force and effect of Leases or Estates at
Will

onely.” Section two excepts from this requirement “all
Leases not exceeding the terme of three years.” Section three provides that no
interest in

land may be “assigned granted or surrendered unlesse it be
by Deed or Note in Writeing signed by the party soe assigning granting or

surrendering the same.” Section four provides, in part, that
“noe Action shall be brought * * * upon any Contract or Sale of Lands * * * or
any

Interest in or concerning them * * * unlesse the Agreement
upon which such Action shall be brought or some Memorandum or Note thereof
shall

be in Writeing and signed by the partie to be charged
therewith.” In short, any conveyance of a property right in land (other than a
short term

lease) and any contract for the assignment, surrender, or
sale of a property right in land must be in writing and signed by at least one
of the

parties.

There has been a longstanding debate whether the Statute of
Frauds, especially as applied to contracts for sales of goods and services,

prevents more frauds than it promotes. But there is not much
doubt that, as applied to transfers of property rights in land, it has
increased the

overall security of property rights, and hence has enabled
transfers of property to occur more frequently and at lower cost. Indeed, the
original

statute was passed as a substitute for a system of
registration of rights in land, and it was widely perceived as successfully
promoting greater

security in land markets. See Philip Hamburger, The
Conveyancing Purposes of the Statute of Frauds, 27 Am. J. Legal Hist. 354
(1983). So we

see one example of a restriction on alienation—a law that
interferes with the ability of owners to dispose of property by oral agreement
or in an

unsigned writing—which nevertheless functions to enhance the
overall transferability of property. See also Anthony T. Kronman & Richard
A.

Posner, The Economics of Contract Law 253–67 (1979); Jason
Scott Johnston, The Statute of Frauds, in The New Palgrave Dictionary of

Economics and Law (Peter Newman ed., 1998).

#851

### 2 .THE DELIVERY REQUIREMENT

In several contexts, the law requires that a transfer take
place only if the thing being transferred or some evidence of title is
delivered to the

transferee. For example, whenever land or an interest in
land (such as an easement) is transferred by deed (a formal writing evidencing
a

transfer), the transfer is deemed to have taken place only
if the deed is delivered to the transferee. Thus, if the transferor makes out a
deed to the

transferee, informs the transferee that the deed has been
signed and sealed, and then puts the deed in his safe, courts generally hold
that no valid

transfer has occurred. As the expression goes, the deed must
be “signed, sealed, and delivered ” before the transaction is complete.

The other prominent type of transfer that requires delivery
is a gift. Here, the law requires either a deed of gift (which must be
delivered) or

actual delivery of the object given. What is the purpose of
insisting on delivery to the recipient before the courts will recognize a valid
gift?

#### Irons v. Smallpiece

```



King’s Bench, 1819.



106 Eng. Rep. 467.



```

Trover for two colts. Plea, not guilty. The defendant was
the executrix and residuary legatee of the plaintiff’s father, and the
plaintiff

claimed the colts, under the verbal gift made to him by the
testator twelve months before his death. The colts however continued to remain
in

possession of the father until his death. It appeared
further that about six months before the father’s death, the son having been to
a neighboring

market for the purpose of purchasing hay for the colts, and
finding the price of that article very high, mentioned the circumstance to his
father;

and that the latter agreed to furnish the colts any hay they
might want at a stipulated price, to be paid by the son. None however was
furnished to

them till within three or four days before the testator’s
death. Upon these facts, Abbott, C.J., was of opinion, that the possession of
the colts never

having been delivered to the plaintiff, the property therein
has not vested in him by the gift; but that it continued in the testator until
at the time of

his death, and consequently that it passed to his executrix
under the will; and the plaintiff therefore was nonsuited.

Gurney now moved to set aside this nonsuit. By the gift, the
property of the colts passed to the son without any actual delivery. In Wortes
v.

Clifton (Roll. Rep. 61), it is laid down by Coke C.J., that,
by the civil law, a gift of goods is not good without delivery; but, in our
law, it is

otherwise; and this is recognized in Shepherd’s Touchstone,
tit. Gift, 226. Here, too, from the time of the contract by the father to
furnish hay for

the colts at the son’s expense, the father became a mere
bailee, and his possession was the possession of the son; and an action might
now be

maintained by the defendant, in her character of executrix,
upon that contract, for the price of the hay actually provided.

#852

■
ABBOTT, C.J. I am of opinion that by the law of England, in order to transfer
property by gift there must either be a deed or instrument of gift,

or there must be an actual delivery of the thing to the
donee. Here the gift is merely verbal, and differs from a donation mortis causa
only in this

respect, that the latter is subject to a condition, that if
the donor live the thing shall be restored to him. Now it is a well established
rule of law,

that a donation mortis causa does not transfer the property
without an actual delivery. The possession must be transferred, in point of
fact; and the

late case of Bunn v. Markham, 2 Marsh. 532, 171 Eng. Rep.
268 (Assizes 1816), where all the former authorities were considered, is a very

strong authority upon that subject. There Sir G. Clifton had
written upon the parcels containing the property the names of the parties for
whom

they were intended, and had requested his natural son to see
the property should pass to the donees. It was therefore manifestly his
intention that

the property should pass to the donees; yet as there was no
actual delivery, the Court of Common Pleas held that it was not a valid gift. I
cannot

distinguish that case from the present, and therefore think
that this property in the colts did not pass to the son by the verbal gift; and
I cannot

agree that the son can be charged with the hay which was
provided for these colts three or four days before the father’s death; for I
cannot think

that that tardy supply can be referred to the contract which
was made so many months before.

■
HOLROYD, J. I am also of the same opinion. In order to change the property by a
gift of this description, there must be a change of possession:

here there has been no change of possession. If indeed it
could be made out that the son was chargeable for the hay provided for the
colts, then

the possession of the father might be considered as the
possession of the son. Here however no hay is delivered during the long
interval from the

time of the contract, until within a few days of the
father’s death; and I cannot think that the hay so delivered is to be
considered in execution of

the contract made so long before, and consequently the son
is not chargeable of the price of it. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1. _Irons_ is usually cited for the proposition that
   delivery is a requirement for a valid gift. If this is so, then why did the
   judges seem to think that the

result might have been different if the father had charged
the son for hay shortly after the son reported that prices for hay were too
high in the market?

At that time, the colts still remained in the custody of the
father. Does this perhaps suggest that the judges in _Irons_ regarded delivery
as just one piece of

evidence tending to show that a valid gift has been made? Is
the delivery requirement here a functional substitute for the signed writing
required in other

contexts by the Statute of Frauds? If so, how well does it
perform the “fraud preventing” function? Courts sometimes stretch the notions
of constructive

and symbolic delivery where intent is clear. See, e.g.,
Hawkins v. Union Trust Co., 175 N.Y.S. 694 (App. Div. 1919 ) (holding that

```



853



```

delivery of letter by decedent evidencing intent to give
plaintiff a disused yacht was sufficient to complete gift).

2 .Why impose restrictions on gifts that do not apply to
sales? In many cultures gift-giving involves an elaborate system of quid pro
quo and

constitutes a major part of the economy. A classic study is
Marcel Mauss, The Gift: Forms and Functions of Exchange in Archaic Societies
(Ian

Cunnison transl., 1954 ). Is a quid pro quo absent from
gift-giving in our own culture? A related but not identical distinction between
gifts and sales

arises in tax law (because gifts are not includable in the
donee’s income and are not deductible to the donor). In the leading decision,
the U.S. Supreme

Court indicated that transferor intent was crucial—namely
whether the donor made the transfer from a “detached and disinterested
generosity” or “out of

affection, respect, admiration, charity or like impulses.”
Commissioner v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278 , 285 ( 1960 ) (citations and internal
quotation marks

omitted). Factfinders were instructed to discover this by
applying the “mainsprings of human conduct to the totality of the facts of each
case.” Id. at 289.

Does the common law do any better? How distinct are gifts,
exchanges, and thefts anyway? See Carol M. Rose, Giving, Trading, Thieving, and

Trusting: How and Why Gifts Become Exchanges, and (More
Importantly) Vice Versa, 44 Fla. L. Rev. 295 ( 1992 ).

3 .When we say that an asset is inalienable, what does this
mean? Quite a number of assets can be given away but not sold. They are market-

inalienable. Recall the discussion of body parts and
personhood in Chapter III and the excerpt from Margaret Jane Radin. Other
assets, like a vote or

one’s entire person, cannot be transferred at all. See,
e.g., Richard A. Epstein, Why Restrain Alienation?, 85 Colum. L. Rev. 970 , 984
– 87 ( 1985 ); Lee

Anne Fennell, Adjusting Alienability, 122 Harv. L. Rev. 1403
, 1412 n. 34 , 1421 – 22 ( 2009 ); Susan Rose-Ackerman, Inalienability and the
Theory of

Property Rights, 85 Colum. L. Rev. 931 ( 1985 ). What
distinguishes things that cannot be given away or sold from other things, and
what distinguishes

things that can be given away but not sold from things that
can be either given away or sold?

4 .The opinions in _Irons_ refer to gifts _causa mortis_ ,
which means gifts in contemplation of death. Such gifts are will substitutes,
and rules

governing their validity developed even earlier than the law
on ordinary gifts, like the one in _Irons_. A valid gift _causa mortis_
requires, in addition to

delivery, that the donor die after making the gift. If the
donor recovers, the gift is nullified. Implementing the delivery requirement
can be especially

difficult when one is on her deathbed, as the following case
illustrates.

#### Foster v. Reiss

```



Supreme Court of New Jersey, 1955.



112 A. 2 d 553.



```

■
VANDERBILT, C.J. On April 30, 1951 the decedent, Ethel Reiss, entered a
hospital in New Brunswick where she was to undergo major surgery.

Just prior to going to the operating room on May 4, 1951,
she wrote the

#854

following note in her native Hungarian language to her
husband, the defendant herein:

My Dearest Papa:

In the kitchen, in the bottom of the cabinet, where the blue
frying pan is, under the wine bottle, there is one hundred dollars.

Along side the bed in my bedroom, in the rear drawer of the
small table in the corner of the drawer, where my stockings are, you will

find about seventy-five dollars. In my purse there is six
dollars, where the coats are. Where the coats are, in a round tin box, on the

floor, where the shoes are, there is two hundred dollars.
This is Dianna’s. Please put it in the bank for her. This is for her schooling.

The Building Loan book is yours, and the Bank book, and also
the money that is here. In the red book is my son’s and sister’s and

my brothers address. In the letter box is also my bank book.

Give Margaret my sewing machine and anything else she may
want; she deserves it as she was good to me.

God be with you. God shall watch your steps. Please look out
for yourself that you do not go on a bad road. I cannot stay with

you. My will is in the office of the former Lawyer
Anekstein, and his successor has it. There you will find out everything.

Your Kissing, loving wife,

Ethel Reiss 1951–5–4.

She placed the note in the drawer of a table beside her bed,
at the same time asking Mrs. Agnes Tekowitz, an old friend who was also

confined in the hospital, to tell her husband or daughter
about it—“In case my daughter come in or my husband come in, tell them they got
a note

over there and take the note.” That afternoon, while the
wife was in the operating room unconscious under the effects of ether, the
defendant

came to the hospital and was told about the note by the
friend. He took the note from the drawer, went home, found the cash, the
savings account

passbook, and the building and loan book mentioned in the
note, and has retained possession of them since that time.

The wife was admittedly in a coma for three days after the
operation and the testimony is in dispute as to whether or not she recovered

consciousness at all before her death on the ninth day. Her
daughter, her son-in-law, Mrs. Waldner, an old friend and one of her
executrices who

visited her every day, and Mrs. Tekowitz, who was in the
ward with her, said that they could not understand her and she could not
understand

them. The defendant, on the other hand, testified that while
she was “awful poor from ether” after the operation, “the fourth, fifth and
sixth days I

thought she was going to get healthy again and come home.
She talked just as good as I with you.” The trial judge who saw the witnesses

After the operation and until the date of her death on May
13, 1951 she was in a coma most of the time; was unable to recognize

members of her family; and unable to carry on intelligent
conversation * * * Mrs. Reiss was never able to talk or converse after

coming out of the operation until her death.

The decedent’s will gave $1 to the defendant and the residue
of her estate to her children and grandchildren. The decedent’s personal

representatives and her trustees under a separation
agreement with the defendant, brought this action to recover the cash, the
passbook, and the

building and loan book from the defendant, who in turn
claimed ownership of them based on an alleged gift causa mortis from his wife.
The trial

court granted judgment for the plaintiffs, concluding that
there had been no such gift. The Appellate Division of the Superior Court
reversed, and

we granted the plaintiff’s petition for certification to the
Appellate Division.

The doctrine of donatio causa mortis was borrowed by the
Roman law from the Greeks, 2 Bl.Com. 514, and ultimately became a part of

English and then American common law. Blackstone has said
that there is a gift causa mortis “when a person in his last sickness,
apprehending

his dissolution near, delivers or causes to be delivered to
another the possession of any personal goods, to keep in case of his decease.”
2 Bl.Com.

514. Justinian offered this definition:

A gift causa mortis is one made in expectation of death;
when a person gives upon condition that, if any fatality happen to him,

the receiver shall keep the article, but that if the donor
should survive, or if he should change his mind, or if the donee should die
first,

then the donor shall have it back again. These gifts causa
mortis are in all respects put upon the same footing as legacies. * * * To put

it briefly, a gift causa mortis is when a person wishes that
he himself should have the gift in preference to the donee, but that the donee

should have it in preference to the heir. Walker’s Just., at
119.

* * * There is some doubt in the New Jersey cases as to
      whether as a result of a gift causa mortis the property remains in the donor
      until his

death, or whether the transfer is considered absolute even
though it is defeasible. In any event, a gift causa mortis is essentially of a
testamentary

nature and as a practical matter the doctrine, though well
established, is an invasion into the province of the statute of wills * * *

In Ward v. Turner, 2 Ves.Sr. 431, 28 Eng. Rep. 275, 279 (Ch.
1 752), Lord Chancellor Hardwicke said that “it was a pity that the Statute of

Frauds did not set aside all these kinds of gifts.” Lord
Eldon expressed the opinion that it would be an improvement of the law to
strike out

altogether this peculiar form of gift, but since that had
not been done, he felt obliged to “examine into the subject of it.” Duffield v.
Elwes, 1

Bligh (N.S.) 497, 533, 4 Eng. Rep. 959, 972 (K.B. 1827). Our
own Vice-Chancellor Stevenson referred to it as “that ancient legal curiosity.”

#856

Dunn v. Houghton, 51 A. 71, 78 (N.J. Ch. 1902), and then
later said that such gifts are “dangerous things”:

These gifts causa mortis are dangerous things. The law
requires, before Mr. Hitt can come into this court and claim $10,000 as an

ordinary testamentary gift from Mrs. Thompson, that he
should produce an instrument in writing signed by Mrs. Thompson, and also

acknowledged with peculiar solemnity by her in the presence
of two witnesses, who thereupon subscribed their names as witnesses.

That is what Mr. Hitt would have to prove if he claimed a
testamentary gift in the ordinary form of one-third of Mrs. Thompson’s

estate. And yet, in cases of these gifts causa mortis , it
is possible that a fortune of a million dollars can be taken away from the
heirs,

the next of kin of a deceased person, by a stranger, who
simply has possession of the fortune, claims that he received it by way of
gift,

and brings parol testimony to sustain that claim. Varick v.
Hitt, 55 A. 139, 153 (N.J. Ch. 1903). * * *

The first question confronting us is whether there has been
“actual, unequivocal, and complete delivery during the lifetime of the donor,

wholly divesting him [her] of the possession, dominion, and
control” of the property[.] * * *

Here there was no delivery of any kind whatsoever. We have
already noted the requirement so amply established in our cases of “actual,

unequivocal and complete delivery during the lifetime of the
donor, wholly divesting her of the possession, dominion, and control” of the

property. This requirement is satisfied only by delivery by
the donor , which calls for an affirmative act on her part, not by the mere
taking of

possession of the property by the donee. * * *

Here we are concerned with three separate items of
property—cash, a savings account represented by a bank passbook, and shares in
a

building and loan association represented by a book. There
was no actual delivery of the cash and no delivery of the indicia of title to
the savings

account or the building and loan association shares. Rather,
the donor set forth in an informal writing her desire to give these items to
the

defendant. Although the writing establishes her donative
intent at the time it was written, it does not fulfill the requirement of
delivery of the

property, which is a separate and distinct requirement for a
gift causa mortis. The cash, passbook, and stock book remained at the
decedent’s

home and she made no effort to obtain them so as to
effectuate a delivery to the defendant.

We disagree with the conclusion of the Appellate Division
that the donee already had possession of the property, and therefore delivery
was

unnecessary. Assuming, but not deciding, the validity of
this doctrine, we note that the house was the property of the deceased and,
although

defendant resided there with her, he had no knowledge of the
presence

#857

of this property in the house, let alone its precise
location therein; therefore it cannot be said that he had possession of the
property. * * *

But it is argued that the decedent’s note to her husband in
the circumstances of the case was an authorization to him to take possession of

the chattels mentioned therein which when coupled with his
taking of possession thereof during her lifetime was in law the equivalent of
the

delivery required in the Roman and common law alike and by
all the decisions in this State for a valid gift causa mortis. Without
accepting this

contention, it is to be noted that it has no application to
the present case, because here at the time the defendant obtained her note the
decedent

was in the operating room under ether and, according to the
finding of the trial court, supra, after the operation and until the date of
her death on

May 13, 1951 she was in a coma most of the time; was unable
to recognize members of her family; and unable to carry on intelligent

conversation * * * Mrs. Reiss was never able to talk or
converse after coming out of the operation until her death.

In these circumstances the note clearly failed as an
authorization to the defendant to take possession of the chattels mentioned
therein, since

at the time he took the note from the drawer the decedent
was under ether and according to the findings of the trial court unable to
transact

business until the time of her death. * * *

The judgment of the Appellate Division of the Superior Court
is reversed and the judgment of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court

will be reinstated.

■
JACOBS, J. (with whom Wachenfeld and William J. Brennan, Jr., JJ., agree)
dissenting. The decedent Ethel Reiss was fully competent when she

freely wrote the longhand note which was intended to make a
gift causa mortis to her husband Adam Reiss. On the day the note was written
her

husband duly received it, located the money and books in
accordance with its directions, and took personal possession of them. Nine days
later

Mrs. Reiss died; in the meantime her husband retained his
possession and there was never any suggestion of revocation of the gift.
Although the

honesty of the husband’s claim is conceded and justice
fairly cries out for the fulfillment of his wife’s wishes, the majority opinion
(while

acknowledging that gifts causa mortis are valid in our State
as elsewhere) holds that the absence of direct physical delivery of the donated

articles requires that the gift be stricken down. I find
neither reason nor persuasive authority anywhere which compels this untoward
result. See

Gulliver and Tilson, Classification of Gratuitous Transfers,
51 Yale L.J. 1, 2 (1941):

One fundamental proposition is that, under a legal system
recognizing the individualistic institution of private property and

granting to the owner the power to determine his successors
in ownership, the general philosophy of the courts should favor giving

effect to an intentional exercise of that power. This is
commonplace enough but it needs constant emphasis, for it may

#858

be obscured or neglected in inordinate preoccupation with
detail or dialectic. A court absorbed in purely doctrinal arguments may lose

sight of the important and desirable objective of
sanctioning what the transferror wanted to do, even though it is convinced that
he

wanted to do it.

Harlan F. Stone in his discussion of Delivery in Gifts of
Personal Property, 20 Col.L.Rev. 196 (1920), points out that the rule requiring

delivery is traceable to early notions of seisin as an
element in the ownership of chattels as well as well as land; and he expresses
the view that as

the technical significance of seisin fades into the
background, courts should evidence a tendency to accept other evidence in lieu
of delivery as

corroborative of the donative intent. See Philip Mechem, The
Requirement of Delivery in Gifts of Chattels, 21 Ill.L.Rev. 341, 345 (1926).

Nevertheless, the artificial requirement of delivery is
still widely entrenched and is defended for modern times by Mechem (supra, at
348) as a

protective device to insure deliberate and unequivocal
conduct by the donor and the elimination of questionable or fraudulent claims
against him.

But even that defense has no applicability where, as here,
the donor’s wishes were freely and clearly expressed in a written instrument
and the

donee’s ensuing possession was admittedly bona fide; under
these particular circumstances every consideration of public policy would seem
to

point towards upholding the gift. * * *

When Ethel Reiss signed the note and arranged to have her
husband receive it, she did everything that could reasonably have been expected

of her to effectuate the gift causa mortis ; and while her
husband might conceivably have attempted to return the donated articles to her
at the

hospital for immediate redelivery to him, it would have been
unnatural for him to do so. It is difficult to believe that our law would
require such

wholly ritualistic ceremony and I find nothing in our
decisions to suggest it. The majority opinion advances the suggestion that the
husband’s

authority to take possession of the donated articles was
terminated by the wife’s incapacity in the operating room and thereafter. The
very reason

she wrote the longhand note when she did was because she
knew she would be incapacitated and wished her husband to take immediate

possession, as he did. Men who enter hospitals for major
surgery often execute powers of attorney to enable others to continue their
business

affairs during their incapacity. Any judicial doctrine which
would legally terminate such power as of the inception of the incapacity would
be

startling indeed—it would disrupt commercial affairs and
entirely without reason or purpose. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .As implied by this case, gifts _causa mortis_ potentially
override other more formal methods of disposing of property upon death—here the
will

giving the husband $ 1. (Putting aside the possible effects
of the separation agreement, the husband would probably be entitled to more

```

this under a forced share statute. See Chapter V.) What is
the rationale for insisting on the delivery requirement in the context where
the intentions of the

deceased seem unequivocally clear? Is it because, as the
majority’s reference to the Statute of Frauds suggests, the court is worried
about the possibility

of fraud being perpetrated in some other case? Formalities
like drawing up a new will can prevent self-interested parties from
perpetrating frauds, but

they can do so at the cost of defeating true transferor
intent. Or, does the delivery requirement provide additional assurance that the
donor adequately

appreciates the potential finality of the decision she is
making? Cf. Lon L. Fuller, Consideration and Form, 41 Colum. L. Rev. 799 , 800
– 03 ( 1941 )

(describing the “cautionary” function of certain legal
formalities). But why doesn’t the carefully composed letter satisfy this
concern?

2 .The New Jersey Supreme Court has not overruled _Foster_
but in a later case it adopted a position closer to that advocated by the
dissent. In

_Scherer v. Hyland_ , 380 A. 2 d 698 , 701 – 02 (N.J. 1977
), a woman endorsed a settlement check in blank and placed it on the kitchen
table along with a

suicide note in the apartment she shared with the plaintiff
and then committed suicide. The court held this satisfied the constructive
delivery requirement

for a valid gift _causa mortis_ in light of the unambiguous
evidence of donative intent and the “universally understood” act of endorsing a
check, which

makes it negotiable. But the delivery requirement may still
be alive in New Jersey. A lower court in a more recent case, relying in part on
_Foster_ , held

that an oral expression by the decedent to the plaintiff
that she wanted her to have her wedding and engagement ring when she died was
not enough

where there was no attempt at delivery, “physically,
constructively, or symbolically.” In re Estate of Link, 746 A. 2 d 540 , 544
(N.J. Super. Ch. 1999 ).

3 .Does one draw any comfort from the fact that the note was
in Mrs. Reiss’s own hand? About half the states accept a will unattested by
witnesses

if it is in the testator’s own hand—a so-called holographic
will. The Uniform Probate Code takes this approach as well. Uniform Probate
Code § 2 –

502 (b) (formerly § 2 – 503 ). New Jersey did not permit
holographic wills when _Foster_ was decided, but amended its probate code in
1977 to make them

enforceable. See Will of Nassano, 489 A. 2 d 1189 , 1190 –
91 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1985 ). Would this change the outcome on the
facts of _Foster_?

Note that even in jurisdictions that accept holographic
wills, the court must be satisfied that the writing reflects the intentions of
the deceased and was

not the product of coercion.

4 .What additional acts would have been required to
establish delivery in this case? If Adam had retrieved the pass books and the
cash, had handed

them to Ethel, and she had immediately handed them back,
would this be enough? What is the point of requiring such a ritual?

#### Gilbert v. McSpadden

```



Court of Civil Appeals of Texas, 1936.



91 S.W. 2 d 889.



```

■
ALEXANDER, JUSTICE. On March 19, 1927, Tom Gilbert and wife executed and
acknowledged a deed conveying to Gilbert’s daughter, Mrs.

Conde Scroggins, and his son, B. C. Gilbert, two tracts of
land in Briscoe county, and on the same day they executed and acknowledged
another

deed conveying to Gilbert’s daughter, Mrs. Cecil McSpadden,
two tracts of land, one in Hill county and the other in Freestone county. Each
deed

recited a consideration of $1 and love and affection. Tom
Gilbert kept the deeds in his possession and continued to exercise dominion
over the

land. On December 19, 1931, he took the deeds from his bank
box in Quitaque in Briscoe county and started to the home of his daughter, Mrs.

Scroggins, in Borger for the avowed purpose of delivering
the deeds to her to be recorded. He arrived at the home of his said daughter at
about 8

o’clock in the evening of December 20, 1931, and retired for
the night. The next morning he was found dead in bed. Shortly thereafter the

children found the deeds in his grip [suitcase] in his room.
They immediately took possession of the deeds and had them recorded and are now

claiming title to the land by virtue of said conveyances.
Mrs. Georgia Oakes Gilbert, as administratrix of the estate of Tom Gilbert,
deceased,

claims that the deeds were never properly delivered and that
as a result said land still belongs to the estate of the deceased, Tom Gilbert,
and that

she as administratrix is entitled to the title and
possession of the land, together with the rents that have been collected
therefrom, for the purpose

of paying the debts owing by said estate.

It is a well-established rule that a deed does not become
effective until it is delivered. It is also well settled that in order to
constitute a

delivery of a deed the facts and circumstances in evidence
must show an intention on the part of the grantor that the deed shall presently
become

operative and effective. The rule is stated in 8 R.C.L. 985,
as follows: “While delivery may be by words or acts, or both combined, and
manual

transmission of the deed from the grantor to the grantee is
not required, it is an indispensable feature of every delivery of a deed,
whether

absolute or conditional, that there be a parting with the
possession of it, and with all power and control over it, by the grantor, for
the benefit of

the grantee at the time of the delivery. The dominion over
the instrument must pass from the grantor with the intent that it shall pass to
the

grantee, if the latter will accept it. And where the proof
fails to show that the grantor did any act by which he parted with the
possession of the

deed for the benefit of the grantee, the question of intent
becomes immaterial. In other words, delivery may be effected by any act or word

manifesting an unequivocal intention to surrender the
instrument so as to deprive the grantor of all authority over it or of the
right of recalling it;

but if he does not evidence an intention to part presently
and unconditionally with the deed, there is no delivery. * * * And while the

#861

rule that the grantor must part with all dominion and
control over his deed does not mean that he must put it out of his physical
power to procure

repossession of it, nevertheless, if the deed remains within
the grantor’s control and liable to be recalled, there is, according to almost
unanimous

authority, no delivery, notwithstanding that he has parted
with its immediate possession. * * * ” In the case at bar there was possibly an
intention

to deliver the deed at some date in the future, but the
grantor retained possession and control of it until his death, without having
evidenced an

intention that it should presently become effective. There
was, therefore, no such delivery as to validate the conveyance.

The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded, with
instructions to the trial court to ascertain the amount of rents due the
administratrix

and to render judgment in her behalf as such administratrix
for the title and possession of said land, together with the rents therefrom.
Said

judgment, however, should be so drawn as not to bar any
right that appellees may have as heirs or devisees of Tom Gilbert, deceased, to
recover

said land, or so much thereof as may remain in the hands of
the administratrix, after said estate has been fully administered.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .As suggested by the facts of _Gilbert_ , there is a good
deal of overlap between cases involving delivery of deeds and those involving
gifts. The

decision also suggests that the deed cases, like cases
involving gifts _causa mortis_ , frequently involve attempts by parties of
relatively modest means to

devise a substitute for the formalities of the Wills Act
(such as the need for witnesses or attestations). The putative grantor would
often draft a deed

during his or her lifetime but intend for it to take effect
only after death, and rather than transmit it to the grantee or record it,
would hide it in a place

where it would be likely to be discovered after his or her
demise. Courts reached different results in assessing whether delivery occurred
in these

circumstances, given often sympathetic claimants and worries
that permitting this sort of activity would destabilize the law of wills.
Compare Matter of

Est. of Dittus, 497 N.W. 2 d 415 , 419 (N.D. 1993 ) (deed
invalid for want of delivery because grantor placed deed in deposit box and
“retained a key to the

safe-deposit box, retained the income generated by renting
the property, and paid the taxes on the property” until death), with McMahon v.
Dorsey, 91

N.W. 2 d 893 , 894 (Mich. 1958 ) (deed valid where grantor
placed deed in deposit box opened only after death but made specific statements
to neighbor

about transfer having occurred at an earlier point). Should
the law in these cases focus more on the intention of the donor, and less on
whether all

“dominion and control” over the deed has passed from the
donor to the donee? Or would it be a better strategy to focus on ways to make
wills easier and

cheaper for ordinary folks to execute? See John H. Langbein,
The Nonprobate Revolution and the Future of the Law of Succession, 97 Harv. L.
Rev.

1108 , 1134 ( 1984 ) (describing the willingness of courts
to twist facts to find pre-death delivery as the “lifetime transfer fiction”);

Intestacy, 53

```

B.C. L. Rev. 877 ( 2012 ) (discussing various reform
proposals). As of 2021 , nineteen states have adopted the Uniform Real Property
Transfer on Death

Act of 2009 , and it is pending in another three. The Act
authorizes a grantor to execute a deed that take effect only upon the grantor’s
death so long as

the deed is both recorded during the grantor’s lifetime and
explicitly testamentary on its face. See § 9.

2 .Should the delivery requirement for deeds to real
property apply only to gratuitous transfers and not to arm’s length sales of
real property?

Consider in this regard that delivery (either of the object
or a writing evidencing a contract) is not required in order to make a binding
contract for the

sale of personal property. The Uniform Commercial Code
(UCC), roughly speaking, establishes a default rule that title passes on
delivery. See UCC § 2 –

401. But delivery is not essential to the formation of a
     binding contact, UCC § 2 – 204 , and the parties are free to make alternative
     arrangements

regarding the passage of title. What accounts for the
difference? Is it because land is presumed to be unique, whereas personal
property (at least in the

typical case) is not? Or is the delivery requirement for
deeds to land just a holdover from the past, land transactions not having been
“modernized” by a

reform effort like the Uniform Commercial Code? Can you
think of other functions the delivery requirement might play in the context of
ordinary real

estate transactions that do not apply to sales of personal
property?

3 .Should the requirement that the parties observe
formalities like the delivery requirement be applied on categorical grounds
(gifts and deeds of

real property—yes; sales of personal property—no), or should
formalities be required or not based on more fine-grained “situational”
criteria? See

Adam Hirsch, Formalizing Gratuitous and Contractual
Transfers: A Situation Theory, 91 Wash. U. L. Rev. 797 ( 2014 ).

### B. LAND TRANSACTIONS

Personal property gifts and sales tend to be discrete
events. A land transaction is stretched out over time, and extends from
negotiation, to

contract execution, to closing and delivery, and finally
recordation. Consider the purchase of residential real estate. The seller will
usually

employ a real estate agent and have the property listed. The
buyer will often have a real estate agent during the search process. When the
buyer is

interested in a particular property, the buyer will ask her
real estate agent, or possibly a lawyer, to make an offer in writing. This may
be preceded

or followed by negotiation. Once a written offer is accepted
by the seller, it is a contract, which will govern the dealings of the seller
and the

buyer until the closing. The Statute of Frauds requires any
contract for the sale of real estate to be in writing (and signed by the person
against

whom it is being enforced). The real estate broker engaged
by the seller will earn a commission, a percentage of the final sales price.
States vary

in terms of when the broker earns this commission. The law
in many states provides a default rule that the broker earns the commission
when the

broker finds a buyer who is “ready, willing, and able” to
buy the property. In such states, if the seller chooses not to sell, the seller
is still

#863

liable to the broker for the commission (unless the seller
and the broker have contracted for something else).

Even though the parties have an enforceable contract for
sale, the seller remains in possession, because there is more work to be done
before

the property can change hands. The purchaser will typically
seek credit to finance the purchase (see Chapter VII) and will have the state
of the

title investigated. Title examination will also be
accompanied by an inspection of the premises for defects and any facts that
might call the

seller’s title into question, such as possession by a third
party. As we will see, the lawyer might check the land records and any other
relevant

records, or hire a title expert (perhaps an employee of a
title insurance company) to conduct the search. Some title companies maintain
their own

set of records, called “title plants.” Such companies will
often insure title against the types of defects that a search should uncover,
but not

against facts like adverse possession that such a record
search would not reveal.

Title insurance policies can be issued for owners or
mortgage lenders. The latter generally insist on being covered by such a
policy, which is

almost always required in order to make the mortgage
available on the secondary market. Both owners’ and mortgage lenders’ policies
are

contracts of indemnity, but unlike most forms of insurance
the policy is paid for in a single lump-sum premium. The insurance company’s
duty is

to indemnify loss from title defects that existed as of the
date the policy was issued and to defend the title against legal attacks on it
(and

relatedly also to cure the title defect if that is possible
within the policy limits). If a title defect is found by the company and
disclosed to the

purchaser, it is not covered by the policy; nor are defects
known to the purchaser and not disclosed to the title insurer. Only problems
with the

title itself are covered: survey errors, adverse possession
claims, and regulatory actions by government that may lower the market value of
land

are excluded. Sometimes the exclusions from a title
insurance policy are so extensive that the policy in effect covers only what is
to be found in

the land records, in which case the policy serves as a
guarantee of the title company’s search of the records and resulting
pronouncement on the

state of the title. The need for title searches and title
insurance are quite characteristic of recording systems. As we will see,
registration systems

have a guarantee built into them: The registrar of deeds
will check documents for their validity and will “purge” defects and invalid
claims.

Registration systems are accompanied by a guarantee fund
that indemnifies title holders against errors by the registrar.

Our recording system shapes the land sale contract as well.
The contract will state that the seller will provide marketable title at the
closing.

Marketable title is title that is free from defects and
encumbrances but need not be perfect title; rather some notion of
reasonableness animates

this standard, such that marketable title is sometimes said
to be title that is free from reasonable doubt or title that

#864

a reasonable person would accept. Nonetheless, the buyer is
not expected to “purchase a lawsuit.” For example, a claim of adverse
possession or

someone else’s colorable claim to have title would make
title unmarketable. An encroachment of a building like those we saw in Chapter
IV

would make title unmarketable (and would involve the
purchase of a lawsuit), but an overhanging awning or cornice probably would not
render

title unmarketable. A body of case law has built up around
the notion of marketable title, in cases where purchasers have tried to back
out of the

deal based on the failure to provide marketable title.
Milton R. Friedman, Contracts and Conveyances of Real Property ch. 14 (8th ed.
2017).

At the closing, the parties will execute the necessary
documents and effect the transfers. The seller will execute and deliver the
deed to the

buyer. The buyer will make out a check to the seller for the
rest of the purchase price (or will direct her attorney to disburse funds from
an escrow

account into which the purchase money was deposited prior to
the closing), and the buyer will often also execute a note and mortgage for the

lender. After the closing the buyer finally takes possession
of the property. Also after the closing, the contract is no longer operative
but is said to

“merge” with the deed. This means that any covenants that
continue to bind the seller must be part of the deed if they are to bind at
all. And if

there is breach the buyer must sue on the deed, not the land
sale contract. Deeds come in different varieties, depending on what sort of
guarantee

the seller makes to the buyer. A general warranty deed
contains a covenant by the seller that he is able to, and does, convey good
title to the

buyer. It usually contains covenants that the seller has
possession, the right to convey, that there are no encumbrances (easements,
mortgages,

etc.) other than those stated in the deed, that the seller
will defend the buyer’s title against attack from parties claiming ownership
under

competing chains of title, that the buyer will have quiet
enjoyment, and that the seller will execute any further documents needed to
provide clear

title. By contrast, a quitclaim deed contains no covenants
of title; such a deed conveys to the buyer whatever the seller had but contains
no

assurance as to what that is. A special warranty deed gives
a covenant against title defects stemming from acts of the grantor and related
parties,

but not other defects. Again, deed covenants can be
supplemented by title insurance.

Unlike most sales of personal property, real estate
transactions stretch over a considerable period. While the relationship of the
seller and the

buyer is still governed by the purchase and sale agreement,
who owns the property and for what purposes? Consider the following case.

#865

#### Wood v. Donohue

```



Court of Appeals of Ohio, First District, 1999.



736 N.E. 2 d 556.



```

■
PAINTER, JUDGE. This case involves the ancient doctrine of equitable conversion
of real estate—when a contract for the sale of real property is

signed, equitable title passes to the buyer. Here, the sale
involved a land installment contract. The trial court, presumably relying on
the doctrine

of equitable conversion, held that the buyer’s equitable
estate in the land was equal to the amount of the purchase money the buyer had
paid as of

December 1 8, [1984] (the date a third party determined the
property had been diminished in value). While appellant Steven B. Donohue (the

buyer) and appellee Betty Lou Wood (the seller) both concede
that the ancient law should be applied, they differ in the manner in which it
should

be applied under the peculiar facts of this case.

In 1983, Donohue and his girlfriend, Vicki Schroot, entered
into a land installment contract with Wood to purchase a house for $87,900.

Donohue and Schroot made a down payment of $30,000 and
agreed to make monthly payments for the remainder of the purchase price under a

thirty-year amortization schedule, with a seven-year balloon
payment. The balance of the purchase price was paid in full in 1990.

The house was located on property near the Fernald uranium
processing plant in Crosby Township. In 1985, a class action was initiated

against the processing plant. Wood, Donohue, and Schroot
filed claims. The lawsuit was settled, with the class members receiving monies
for the

diminution in value of their property as of December 18,
1984. The lawsuit’s filing, settlement, and “diminution date” were all after
the

execution of the land contract. The Fernald trustees awarded
$9,478 as compensation for the diminished value of the property involved in
this

case and issued a check in 1993 to Donohue, Schroot, and
Wood. However, the check was not cashed.

Wood filed a complaint against Donohue, which was later
amended to include Schroot and the Fernald Settlement Fund Trustees, seeking a

declaration that she was entitled to 65.41% of the
settlement check and that Donohue and Schroot were entitled to the remainder.
After the

Fernald trustees deposited a new check in an
interest-bearing escrow account, Wood dismissed them from the case.

The trial court, after a bench trial, entered judgment for
Wood, awarding her 65.41% of the settlement and Donohue the remainder. The

apportionment was based on the portion of the purchase money
paid by Donohue as of December 18, 1984, the date chosen by the Fernald

trustees to determine the diminution amount. (Schroot’s
counsel appeared and stated on the record before trial that Schroot was
surrendering any

interest she had in the award. There is, however, no order
journalizing her surrender or her dismissal. Instead, the trial court ordered
that Schroot

take nothing from the settlement.)

#866

Donohue appeals the trial court’s decision to apportion the
settlement award, contending in his sole assignment of error that the trial
court

erred in rendering a judgment contrary to law. In support of
his assignment, Donohue argues that because he was the purchaser of the
property

under the land installment contract, he was entitled to the
full settlement amount under the doctrine of equitable conversion.

Under the long-recognized doctrine of equitable conversion,
where land is contracted to be sold, even under an executory contract, equity

treats the exchange as actually taking place when the
contract becomes effective. As explained by Lord Thurlow in Fletcher v.
Ashburner [1 Bro.

C.C. 497 (1779)], “ ‘[M]oney directed to be employed in the
purchase of land, and land directed to be sold and turned into money, are to be

considered as that species of property into which they are
directed to be converted; and this in whatever manner the direction is given,
whether

by will, by way of contract, marriage articles, settlement,
or otherwise; and whether the money is actually deposited or only covenanted to
be

paid, whether the land is actually conveyed or only agreed
to be conveyed, the owner of the fund, or the contracting parties, may make
land

money, or money land.’ ”

Thus, the seller, in equity, becomes the owner of the
purchase money, and the purchaser becomes the owner of the property. “The
interest of

the vendor under a contract of purchase is a right to
receive the balance of the purchase price, which is secured by his retaining
the legal title.”

Berndt v. Lusher, 178 N.E. 14, 15 (Ohio App. 1931).

Ohio courts have analogized the seller’s retention of the
legal title to the property as a lien “similar to a mortgage for the unpaid
purchase

price; the title is kept as security for the debt.
Furthermore, it is presumed that a vendor with such a lien retains the title,
not the land, as security

for payment of the price.” Flint v. Holbrook, 608 N.E.2d
809, 814 (Ohio App. 1992).

While the concept of equitable conversion has been used
predominantly to determine rights under standard sales contracts, the doctrine
has

also been applied in Ohio to land installment contracts. In
Blue Ash Bldg. & Loan Co., a case in which this court determined that the
sale of

mortgaged property by land installment contracts constituted
a “change in ownership” within the meaning of the acceleration-of-payment
clauses

in mortgage agreements, we applied the doctrine of equitable
conversion. We relied, in part, on the following explanation of the interest of
a

purchaser under a land installment contract: “ ‘The vendee
obtains an equitable estate entitling him generally to all the incidents of
ownership.

The vendee has the right to use the property free from
interference of the vendor and is not impeachable for waste unless the security
of the

vendor becomes impaired.’ ” Blue Ash Bldg. & Loan Co. v.
Hahn, 484 N.E.2d 186, 189 (Ohio App. 1984).

We explained that “[u]ntil the vendee has performed all his
obligations under the contract and has attained legal title to the property,

#867

he does not stand as sole owner of the property. However, he
does stand as an equitable owner of the property with the obligations and
incidents

of ownership attendant to possession of the property.” Id.
We relied on Black’s Law Dictionary to define an “equitable owner” in this
manner:

“ ‘One who is recognized in equity as the owner of property,
because the real and beneficial use and title belong to him, although the

bare legal title is vested in another, e.g., a trustee for
his benefit. One who has present title in land which will ripen into legal

ownership upon the performance of conditions subsequent.
There may therefore be two “owners” in respect of the same property, one

the nominal or legal owner, the other the beneficial or
equitable owner.’ ” Id.

We then analogized a land installment contract to the
situation where a seller and purchaser have entered into a contract for the
sale of land,

but legal title has not yet passed, to explain, “ ‘The
purchaser’s interest under an enforceable contract is treated as real property
for many

purposes under the principles of equitable conversion. He is
regarded in equity as the owner, with the legal title held in trust for him.
His position

is similar to that of a mortgagor, especially where the
mortgagee holds the legal title.’ ” Id. We concluded that “the vendee of a land
installment

contract stands as an equitable owner of property sold under
the contract * * * .” Id.

This conclusion is further supported by R.C. 5313.01(A),
which defines a “land installment contract,” as “an executory agreement * * *
[in

which a] vendee agrees to pay the purchase price in
installment payments, while the vendor retains title to the property as
security for the

vendee’s obligation.” This “statutory language clearly
describes the vendor’s retention of title ‘as security for the vendee’s
obligation’ to pay the

balance of the installment payments under the land
contract.” In re Johnson, 75 B.R. 927, 930 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 1987).

Thus, the land contract in this case effectively transferred
the ownership and equitable title of the property to Donohue. As the equitable

owner, Donohue bore all losses, but also was entitled to
enjoy all the benefits that might accrue.

The doctrine of equitable conversion is usually applied to
determine which party bears the loss when property is damaged by an accidental

occurrence after a real estate contract has been entered,
but before a deed is executed. The usual scenario involves a determination of
who is

entitled to insurance proceeds. We see no reason not to
apply that analysis to the settlement proceeds in this case. To do so seems
especially

equitable where the land installment contract clearly
demonstrates that the parties intended for Donohue to bear any loss by
providing that (1)

while Wood was to maintain “hazard” insurance on the
property to the extent of the remaining purchase price, Donohue was to be
considered a

named insured and had the obligation to pay what constituted
the annual premium in monthly installments, (2) the insurance proceeds were to
be

#868

used either to repair or to reconstruct the property, (3)
Donohue was entitled to any excess after reconstruction or repair, and (4) if
the property

were a total loss, Donohue had the option to repair or
reconstruct the property or to apply the proceeds to the purchase price and
complete the

purchase.

Under the doctrine of equitable conversion, any loss in the
property’s value due to an accidental occurrence fell on Donohue as owner of
the

equitable title. We conclude that, like insurance proceeds,
the settlement money from the Fernald trustees provided to Wood was held by her
as

trustee for Donohue, subject to her own claims for any
unpaid purchase money. Thus, under the doctrine of equitable conversion, Wood
was only

entitled to the proceeds to the extent that she could prove
that her security interest in the unpaid purchase money had been impaired. By
the time

the money was paid, Wood had received the purchase money.
Thus, the proceeds should have been paid to Donohue alone. Otherwise, Wood

would be unfairly enriched by, in effect, recovering twice
on the same property—the purchase price that she asked for and received, and
damages

for the diminution in value, which she did not suffer.

Accordingly, we affirm the trial court’s judgment as to
Schroot. We reverse the trial court’s judgment as to Wood and Donohue. We enter

judgment for Donohue, ordering that the entire settlement
amount placed in the escrow account, plus all accrued interest, be awarded to
him.

Judgment accordingly.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The doctrine of equitable conversion is sometimes said to
derive from the right of the purchaser of land to the equitable remedy of
specific

performance. The reasoning is that because property in land
is unique and an award of damages would not make the purchaser whole, one who
contracts

to purchase real property is therefore entitled to an order
requiring conveyance of the specific rights for which the purchaser has
contracted. In the

principal case, why, then, does the damages award, which
consists of money rather than specific property, go to Donohue? Could one
consider the

damages award as deferred compensation to Wood for the sale
of the property?

2 .Many equitable conversion cases involve insurance
proceeds. The seller and the purchaser can contract as to who bears the risk of
loss and who

has the duty to insure, but the default rules vary by state.
Some states apply equitable conversion and put the risk of loss on the
purchaser from the

moment the contract of purchase and sale was signed. Other
states place the loss on the seller until the closing, and still others place
the loss on whoever

is in possession at the time the loss occurs. (Even in
states that apply equitable conversion to risk of loss, the loss falls on the
seller if he negligently

caused it, say by smoking in bed.) Equitable conversion
matters also in how it characterizes an interest. Thus, in a will referring to
“my real property”

```



869



```

and “my personal property,” these terms track the equitable
title. So if the seller dies during the executory period, her interest in the
land is considered

personal property, and if the purchaser dies before closing,
his interest in the land is considered real property. The real versus personal
property

distinction can matter for other purposes as well, for
instance, where real property goes directly to the heir and personal property
passes through the

hands of the executor. Does all this reflect people’s likely
intent or expectations? Or is it carrying a legal fiction too far? How about
the rule that

equitable conversion applies (at the moment of death) where
a will directs real estate to be sold, making the property fall under the
category of personal

rather than real property?

3 .Equitable conversion is equitable in the sense that it
was developed by the equity courts and has been shaped by the equitable mode of

reasoning. It is often associated with the equitable maxim
“equity regards as done that which ought to be done.” More specifically the
mechanics of the

doctrine involve separation of legal and equitable
(beneficial) title. The legal title retained by the seller can be used to
establish the seller’s right to

remain in possession until the purchase price is paid. It
also functions as a kind of security interest should the buyer fail to come up
with the funds for

the purchase, in an echo of the title theory of mortgages.

4 .In _Wood v. Donohue_ , if we assume that the purchase
price negotiated by the parties in 1983 reflected the diminished value of the
property due to

its proximity to the uranium processing plant, why would Ms.
Wood be unjustly enriched by receiving a portion of the settlement award?
Wouldn’t the

settlement simply offset the lower price she received on the
sale because of the location of the plant? If the settlement had been agreed
upon before the

parties signed the land sale contract in 1983 , but the
proceeds were distributed after the contract was executed, would Donohue be
entitled to the

settlement proceeds? Or on these facts would they belong to
Wood?

NOTE ON LAND DEMARCATION

In a transfer of land, or in any assertion of ownership of
land, it is essential to know exactly what land is being claimed (or is covered
by a

mortgage, and so on). Deeds accordingly must contain some
description of the land. Likewise, as we will see, part of the keeping of land
records

involves identifying the land. For all these purposes, some
system of land demarcation is required.

Most land demarcation systems fall into one of two broad
categories. Historically the more common is the _metes and bounds_ system, in
which land

boundaries are usually marked using monuments like rocks,
trees, and other structures as well as compass directions, distances, and
angles (“courses and

distances,” as in “start at the big stone by Lake Lemon and
then proceed North 25 Degrees East for 150 rods.. .”). In some cases, metes and
bounds

descriptions do not provide perimeters, but rather refer to
the landholdings of neighbors or other nearby features. This system prevails in
the Eastern

states. Mistakes in this system are easy to make. Not only
do monuments

```



870



```

like trees or fences rot away, but it is not uncommon for a
description to fail to achieve closure (returning to the starting point), to
have some overlap

with the description of an adjacent parcel, to contain
misstatements like substituting “south” for “north,” and so on. For example,
parts of Texas use

metes and bounds for claims tracing to Spanish land grants
(while the rest of the state uses a version of the rectangular survey), which
can lead to some

knotty litigation, as described by one court:

```



None of the original monuments on the ground to Porcion 72
and none of the original monuments to the grants which surround this



porcion, including the location of the Rio Grande River in
1767 can be found today. Appellant admits that all of these monuments of the



original surveys have disappeared except as to the beginning
point of the 1767 survey of Porcion 72 which he contends that the state



appointed surveyor Byron L. Simpson has located by following
the footsteps of the original surveys from the calls contained in the original



field notes of 1767. * * * Insofar as a determination of the
boundary lines of Porcion 72 is concerned, appellant argues and the appellees



agree, that the only legal relevant inquiry is the location
of such grant as surveyed by the Spanish surveyors in 1767. Surveyor Simpson
has



attempted to locate Porcion 72 by course and distance from
where he contends the beginning point was in the original survey in the year



1767 , and by such construction he locates Porcion 72 in
such a manner as to create a vacancy between Porcion 72 and Los Torritos Grant
to



the east.

Strong v. Delhi-Taylor Oil Corp., 405 S.W. 2 d 351 , 354
(Tex. Civ. App. 1966 ). In urban areas the existence of well-surveyed streets
makes life easier, as

in this description of a parcel in Buffalo:

```

city of Buffalo, county of Erie and state of New York, being part of lot no.

(formerly Tryon Place), 273 feet south of its intersection with the southerly

southerly line of West Delevan Avenue 136. 62 feet; thence southerly parallel
with



Parkdale Avenue 30 feet; thence easterly parallel with West
Delevan Avenue 136. 62 feet to the said westerly line of Parkdale Avenue;
thence



northerly along the westerly line of Parkdale Avenue 30 feet
to the point of beginning.

Mary L. Cataudella & Lawrence P. Heffernan, Real Estate
Title Practice in Massachusetts ch. 3 ( 2010 ).

The other type of system is the rectangular survey.
Rectangles have many advantages because of their shape, in terms of how they
come together,

and for their easy divisibility. From the Second Century
B.C., the Romans famously used large squares of 710 meters on a side divided
into 100 plots.

The large squares were not uniformly oriented but fitted to
the local landscape. In the United States, a rectangular survey system, which

```



871



```

originated with the Land Ordinance of 1785 , defines
rectangular plots of any size, employing a systematic survey with references to
latitude and

longitude. Starting from the point where the Ohio River
crosses the Pennsylvania border, “a north-south line—a principal meridian—was
to be run and a

base line westward—the geographer’s line—was to be surveyed;
parallel lines of longitude and latitude were to be surveyed, each to be 6
miles apart,

making for townships of 36 square miles or 23 , 040 acres.
Seven rows or ranges of townships running south from the base line and west of
the principal

meridian were to be surveyed. Each township was to be
divided into lots of one mile square containing 640 acres.” Paul W. Gates,
History of Public

Land Law Development 65 ( 1968 ); see also Andro Linklater,
Measuring America ( 2002 ). Nearly all the land in the federal public
domain—the vast

preponderance of the physical space of America—was
eventually surveyed and disposed of using this system. This is why rural roads
in most parts of

the country run along straight lines (section lines), why
most farms are square in shape, and why most lots in cities are rectangular.

The diagram in Figure 8 - 1 illustrates the system of
surveying established by the Land Ordinance of 1785. It shows how you would
identify a tract

of property with the following legal description: “the
Northwest quarter of the Southwest quarter of Section 29 , Township 3 South,
Range 4 West, ___

Base and Meridian.” Note that every section contains 640
acres, a quarter section 160 acres, and a quarter-quarter section (such as
described here) 40

acres.

Which system is better? The rectangular survey is more
expensive to set up but leads to more certain descriptions and is easier to use
on an

ongoing basis. Metes and bounds can be tailored to rugged
terrain. For recent work suggesting that the rectangular survey adds greatly to
land value, see

Gary D. Libecap & Dean Lueck, Land Demarcation Systems,
in Research Handbook on the Economics of Property Law 257 (Kenneth Ayotte &
Henry

E. Smith eds., 2011 ). Libecap and Lueck report on a natural
experiment involving the Virginia Military District, an area of Ohio that was
allocated

through scrip to Revolutionary war veterans under the old
Virginia system of metes and bounds. In an econometric study of counties on
either side of the

boundary between the VMD and the rest of Ohio (which is on
the rectangular survey), they show that the rectangular survey is associated
with fewer

disputes, more roads, 50 percent more land transactions, and
substantially greater land values persisting over more than a century. Gary D.
Libecap &

Dean Lueck, The Demarcation of Land and the Role of
Coordinating Property Institutions, 119 J. Pol. Econ. 426 ( 2011 ).

Libecap and Lueck see physical shapes as leading to economic
value. Other legal institutions and community norms may be involved and even

point in other directions. Libecap and Lueck do not deny
that the rectangular survey also had a legal dimension, and this opens the
possibility that these

legal aspects or associated public investments in
infrastructure may lead to the increases in land values they observe. See
Benito Arruñada, Property as

Sequential Exchange: The Forgotten Limits of Private
Contract, 13 J. Inst. Econ. 753 ( 2017 ).

The metes and bounds system benefits from local knowledge,
and it may have been uniquely suited to American colonial development. Maureen

```

In early New England, social and legal practices reinforced
boundary upkeep and created witnesses who could attest to even the most
imprecisely

described boundary locations for buyers or in eventual
litigation. One of these practices was “perambulation,” in which neighbors and
family members

processed along boundaries, striking the boundary markers
with sticks and branches. Children were brought along for the purpose of
creating witnesses

likely to be around for many years. Indeed, some anecdotes
suggest that children were struck during these processions, so as to impress
the boundary

markers’ locations more firmly into their memories. Allegra
di Bonaventura, Beating the Bounds: Property and Perambulation in Early New
England,

19 Yale J.L. & Human. 115 ( 2007 ). Metes and bounds
descriptions, as well as the social and legal practices supporting them, may
have offered other

benefits to colonial society. They built social capital
among existing settlers while tightly controlling entry into land markets to
those who could decode

markers like “where Philo Blake killed the bear.”
Nevertheless, as land became scarcer and the population grew, even New
Englanders sought to

standardize parcel descriptions—using more measurable
perimeters instead of references to neighbors, for instance—and rectangular
lots became more

common.

What about rectangular lots might be advantageous? Is it
simply a matter of reduced surveying costs? Are there other explanations for
why

rectangular plots of land might prove to be more productive
over time? For some relevant thoughts concerning the advantages and
disadvantages of

laying out city streets in a grid, see Robert C. Ellickson,
The Law and Economics of Street Layouts: How a Grid Pattern Benefits a
Downtown, 64 Ala.

L. Rev. 463 ( 2013 ), and Maureen E. Brady, The Failure of
America’s First City Plan, 46 Urb. Law. 507 ( 2014 ). Historically, many metes
and bounds and

rectangular survey systems differed not just in how land is
described but also how it is allocated. In some metes and bounds systems, land
was surveyed

in groups of plots, but in others, settlers were given more
choice about which land to claim: They could claim around rocky or marshy
patches, often

leaving these lower valued lands isolated and unclaimed. The
rectangular system, in contrast, tended to force settlers to take quarter
sections of land on

an all-or-nothing basis, the bad along with the good. Today,
the accuracy afforded by surveys using the rectangular system can now be
replicated in a

metes and bounds system using GPS technology. Does this
development lead to the prediction that the differences in value identified by
Libecap and

Lueck will disappear in the future? If not, why not?

### C. NEMO DAT

The baseline principle of our system of property regarding
transfers of ownership is nemo dat quod non habet —“one cannot give that which

one does not have.” The phrase, in a closely related
variant, traces back at least as far as the Digest of Justinian (Digest 50.54),
which credits it to

the Roman jurist Ulpian (Ad Edictum 46). In other words, if
I own something because someone transferred it to me—by sale, gift, bequest,
etc.

—I normally have only that which the previous owner had and
nothing more. This is sometimes called the “derivation” principle: The

#874

transferee’s rights derive from those of the transferor. See
Douglas G. Baird & Thomas H. Jackson, Cases, Problems, and Materials on
Security

Interests in Personal Property 3–8 (2d ed. 1987).
Willingness to buy the Brooklyn Bridge is considered a symbol of gullibility
because we

assume everyone knows about the principle of nemo dat and
would have to be out of their mind to think that the offeror actually has the
rights to

sell it. Jeanne L. Schroeder, Is Article 8 Finally Ready
This Time? The Radical Reform of Secured Lending On Wall Street, 1994 Colum.
Bus. L.

Rev. 291, 296 & n.6.

Nemo dat is also related to the principle of “prior in time
is prior in right.” Here the classic problem is someone, A, who transfers his
or her

interest to B and then turns around, and out of mistake or
deceit, transfers to C. Who owns the property? According to the nemo dat
principle, it

would be B, because A had rights to transfer when A
transferred to B. Now B has the rights. When A later transfers to C, A has no
rights to

transfer and hence by nemo dat C gets nothing. Of course C
could sue A, but A in such situations will often (not coincidentally) have fled
the

jurisdiction or be judgment-proof. There are, as we will
see, situations in which C could prevail over B, but nemo dat and its
first-in-time

implications are the baseline.

Nemo dat appears to reflect an understanding that property
rights are always exclusive, in the sense that two persons cannot hold the same

property right at the same time. See James Y. Stern, The
Essential Structure of Property Law, 115 Mich. L. Rev. 1167 (2017). Thus, if a
used car

dealer, perhaps out of confusion, sells the same car to
three different persons, only one will end up owning the car, although the
other two may

have a breach of contract action against the dealer. Of
course, to say that property rights are exclusive in this sense does not mean
that property

cannot be shared, as in a tenancy in common or joint
tenancy. If A, B, and C are tenants in common, each has an interest that is
exclusive against

strangers, but not as against each other. But A’s interest
in tenancy in common cannot be held simultaneously with someone who is not a
tenant

in common, such as D. Is the understanding that property
rights are exclusive, in this sense, another fundamental feature of property?
Or can

exclusivity—and nemo dat —be derived from the role separate
legal things and associated exclusion strategies play in property law?

The nemo dat principle rests on a vision of a chain of
transactions. Current owners must be able to trace their ownership back in time

through a series of legitimate transfers (ideally) to an act
of legitimate original acquisition. Later we consider ways in which the law
cuts off the

need for this tracing to an ultimate root of title. But the
tracing itself can prove to be quite complicated, as illustrated by the
following case.

#### Kunstsammlungen Zu Weimar v. Elicofon

```



United States District Court, Eastern District of New York,
1981.



536 F.Supp. 829 , affirmed, 678 F. 2 d 1150 ( 2 d Cir. 1982
).



```

■
MISHLER, DISTRICT JUDGE. This action was commenced in 1969 by the Federal
Republic of Germany, as the representative of the people of

Germany, to recover possession from defendant Elicofon of
two portraits painted by the renowned fifteenth century German artist Albrecht

Duerer. The paintings disappeared from their place of
safekeeping in Germany during the occupation of Germany by the Allied Forces in
the

summer of 1945. In 1966 the paintings were discovered in the
possession of Elicofon, who had purchased them in Brooklyn, New York from an

American serviceman in 1946.

By order dated March 25, 1969, this court granted the Grand
Duchess of Saxony-Weimar leave to intervene as plaintiff. The Grand Duchess

asserted ownership to the paintings by assignment from her
husband, Grand Duke Carl August. And by order dated February 24, 1975, six
years

later, the Kunstsammlungen zu Weimar, a museum located in
what is now the German Democratic Republic, the predecessor of which had

possession of the paintings before their disappearance, and
which claims to be entitled to recover them from Elicofon, was granted the
right to

intervene as plaintiff in this action.

Thereafter, on December 9, 1975, the original plaintiff, the
Federal Republic of Germany, discontinued its claim with prejudice. And in a

Memorandum of Decision and Order, dated August 24, 1978,
this court dismissed the intervenor-complaint and cross-complaint of the Grand

Duchess of Saxony-Weimar. Thus, the only parties remaining
in the action are the plaintiff-intervenor Kunstsammlungen and the defendant

Elicofon.

Presently before the court are the motions of
plaintiff-intervenor Kunstsammlungen zu Weimar for summary judgment and the
cross-motion

of defendant Elicofon for summary judgment.

HISTORICAL SETTING & FACTS

Until 1927, the Duerer portraits which are the subject of
this suit formed part of the private art collection of the Grand Duke of Saxe-

Weimar-Eisenach. Under the terms of a Settlement Agreement
of 1927 between the Land of Thuringia and the widow of Wilhelm Ernst, the then

owner of the private collection, title to the Grand Ducal
Art Collection had been transferred to the Land of Thuringia. Thuringia was
created by

Federal German Law of April 20, 1920 and was the legal
successor to the territory of Weimar, which included as one of its seven
subdivisions

Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the territory over which the Grand
Dukes formerly had presided before being ousted from power.

In 193 3, Hitler assumed power in Germany. Throughout much
of the period of the Third Reich, until 1943, the Duerer paintings remained

on exhibit in a museum in Weimar, Thuringia, known as the
Staatliche Kunstsammlungen zu Weimar, the predecessor to the Kunstsammlungen

zu Weimar. But in 194 3, after the commencement of World War
II, Dr. Walter Scheidig, the then Director of the Staatliche, according to his

account, anticipated the bombardment of Weimar and had the
Duerers and other valuable items of the museum transferred to a storeroom in a

wing of a nearby castle, the Schloss Schwarzburg, located in
the District of Rudolstadt in the Land of Thuringia, where they remained until
their

disappearance in the summer of 1945.

On May 8, 1945, the Hitler Government surrendered. On June
5, 1945, the Allied Powers—the United Kingdom, the United States, the

U.S.S.R. and the French Republic—issued a Declaration
stating that the Allied Governments assumed supreme authority with respect to

Germany, including all the powers possessed by the German
Government. For the purposes of occupation, Germany was divided into four zones

with one of the Four Powers assuming military authority over
each zone to effect its own policy in regard to local matters and the policy

#877

of the Allied Control Council in regard to matters affecting
Germany as a whole.

Under the June 1945 Declaration the Land of Thuringia was
designated to be part of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. However, the

American Military Forces had occupied Thuringia, with a
regiment stationed at Schwarzburg Castle, since the defeat of Germany or some
time

before the official surrender in April or May of 1945. In
accordance with the Allied plan, on July 1, 1945, the United States turned over
control

of Thuringia to the Soviet Armed Forces. According to Dr.
Scheidig’s account, the disappearance of the Duerer portraits from Schwarzburg

Castle coincided in time with the departure of the American
troops from the Castle.

Political differences and disagreement over the future of
Germany developed between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union.

Irreconcilable divisions prompted the Soviet Union’s
Commander in Chief to resign from the Allied Control Council on March 7, 1948
and the

Council thereafter ceased meeting as the combined governing
body of occupied Germany. On September 21, 1949, the Federal Republic of

Germany was established in the former French, British and
United States Zones; and on October 7, 1949, the German Democratic Republic was

established in the former Soviet Zone.

On April 14 , 1969, retroactive to January 1, 1969, the
Minister of Culture of the German Democratic Republic, issued an order
conferring

juridical personality upon the former Staatliche
Kunstsammlungen, which thereafter became known as the Kunstsammlungen zu
Weimar, a status

which under East German Law entitled the Kunstsammlungen to
maintain suit for return of the Duerers. The Kunstsammlungen moved to

intervene as a plaintiff in this action for return of the
Duerer portraits in April 1969. In a Memorandum of Decision and Order dated
September

25, 19 72, we denied the motion to intervene on the ground
that the Kunstsammlungen was an arm and instrumentality of the German
Democratic

Republic, a country not recognized by the United States at
the time. On September 4, 1974, the United States extended formal recognition
to the

German Democratic Republic. Accordingly, by order of
February 24, 1975, upon motion, we vacated our prior order and permitted the

Kunstsammlungen to file its complaint. In its complaint, the
Kunstsammlungen alleges that the Duerer paintings were stolen in 1945 from the

Staatliche Kunstsammlungen zu Weimar and that Elicofon
acquired them from the thief or his transferee and, therefore, has no right to
them; and

that as successor to the rights of the former Territory of
Weimar and Land of Thuringia, the Kunstsammlungen is entitled to immediate

possession. In his answer Elicofon denies that he holds the
paintings wrongfully and on the basis of certain affirmative defenses, which
are

asserted in support of its motion for summary judgment,
denies that the Kunstsammlungen is entitled to recover the paintings.

#878

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENTS

In support of its motion for summary judgment,
Kunstsammlungen argues:

There exists no genuine issue of material fact as to whether
Elicofon could have acquired good title. The uncontradicted account of Dr.

Scheidig, Director of the Kunstsammlungen at the time the
paintings disappeared, creates the irrefutable inference that the paintings
were stolen

in 1945 from Schwarzburg Castle. Thus, Elicofon could not
have acquired good title to the Duerers even if he purchased them without

knowledge of their source. * * *

A.The Kunstsammlungen’s Motion for Summary Judgment

In moving for summary judgment the movant bears the burden
of showing the absence of a genuine issue as to any material fact. The

Kunstsammlungen argues that the irrefutable facts in this
case indicate that Elicofon could not have acquired good title to the Duerers.

According to Elicofon, he acquired the Duerer portraits in
1946 when he bought them for $450 from a young American ex-serviceman,

about 25 to 30 years old, who appeared at Elicofon’s
Brooklyn home with about eight paintings and who told Elicofon that he had
purchased the

paintings in Germany. Although Elicofon learned the name of
the person he has since forgotten it. Elicofon had the paintings framed and
hung

them on a wall in his home with others. They remained there
until 1966 when a friend, Stern, having seen a pamphlet containing lists of
stolen

artworks, informed Elicofon of their identity. At that time
Elicofon made public his possession of the Duerers which precipitated a demand
by

the Kunstsammlungen for their return. Elicofon maintains
that he purchased the paintings in good faith, without knowledge of their
source or

identity.

For the purpose of its motion for summary judgment, the
Kunstsammlungen accepts the truth of Elicofon’s version of the manner in which

he acquired the Duerers. The Kunstsammlungen argues that
good faith is irrelevant.

It is a fundamental rule of law in New York that a thief or
someone who acquires possession of stolen property after a theft “cannot
transfer

a good title even to a bona fide purchaser for value
[because] [o]nly the true owner’s own conduct, or the operation of law... can
act to divest

that true owner of title in his property... .” 3 Williston,
Sales § 23–12.

The Kunstsammlungen contends that the circumstances
surrounding the disappearance of the Duerers leave no question that the
paintings

were stolen from Schwarzburg Castle where they had been
stored, and that consequently Elicofon could not have acquired title to the
paintings.

Elicofon claims that there does exist a question as to those
facts on which the Kunstsammlungen relies to establish a theft; alternatively,
he

claims, such a theft does not preclude a finding that
Elicofon’s transferor acquired good title to the paintings in Germany.

#879

Thus, the question on this motion is whether the facts about
which there is no genuine dispute indicate that Elicofon bought the paintings
from

one who was incapable of conveying title.

1.The Occurrence of a Theft

On a motion for summary judgment, the moving party has the
initial burden of presenting “evidence on which, taken by itself, it would be

entitled to a directed verdict.” Donnelly v. Guion, 467 F.2d
290, 293 (2d Cir. 1972). The facts about which the Kunstsammlungen contends
there

is no dispute were related by Dr. Walter Scheidig. Until
1940 Dr. Scheidig was the Deputy Director of the Kunstsammlungen zu Weimar, and

from 1940 to 1967 was the Director of the museum. The facts
were told by Dr. Scheidig at a deposition conducted by counsel for all parties
to

this action in May, 1971; in addition, various documents and
letters are submitted as exhibits in support thereof. Dr. Scheidig died in
1974. [The

court reviews the deposition testimony of Dr. Scheidig and
concludes that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the theft. The
court then

goes on to decide other issues of German law and of statutes
of limitations and standing in favor of the East German art museum.] * * *

Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment is granted and
defendant’s cross motion for summary judgment denied. Defendant is directed to

deliver the Duerers to plaintiff, the Kunstsammlungen.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .In its opinion affirming the district court, the Second
Circuit remarked: “The search for an answer to the deceptively simple question,
‘Who

owns the paintings?,’ involves a labyrinthian journey
through 19 th century German dynastic law, contemporary German property law,
Allied Military

Law during the post-War occupation of Germany, New York
State law, and intricate conceptions of succession and sovereignty in
international law.” 678

F. 2 d at 1153. Other aspects of the dispute centered on
whether the Grand Duchess of Saxony-Weimar had a claim to the paintings as
being part of her

ancestral private collection or whether the paintings were
held as crown property. Because the court held them to be crown property,
successor

governments acquired all the rights of the predecessor
governments; in other words, when old governments fell or one administrative
unit was replaced

by another, title passed from government to government under
_nemo dat_ as well. (The paintings now reside in the Schlossmuseum in Weimar,
part of the

City Palace, the traditional residence of the dukes of
Saxe-Weimar and Eisenach.) How does the _nemo dat_ principle figure in Justice
Marshall’s opinion

in _Johnson v. M’Intosh_ , excerpted in Chapter II?

2 .This case also illustrates that the _nemo dat_ baseline
forms the backdrop not only to the common law but also to German civil law. In
German

law, however, the good faith purchaser exception to _nemo
dat_ is wider than in American law, and in Germany a good faith purchaser could
acquire good

title from a thief. New York’s choice of law provided that
the law of the state where the transfer occurred should govern its validity.
When

```

the works left the castle in Thuringia, the person living in
the castle (who had been refurbishing it as a summer retreat for Hitler, and
whom Dr. Scheidig

suspected might have also been involved in the theft) did
not have sufficient possession to be able to transfer title to a good faith
purchaser under

German law. And, in the alternative, if Allied Military Law
applied, any such transfer was likewise void. So Elicofon’s predecessor could
not have

achieved good title at that point. The transfer was
therefore deemed to have occurred in Brooklyn, requiring the application of New
York law. As stated

in the case, the general rule in the United States,
including New York, is that one cannot acquire good title from someone who has
obtained the property

other than by operation of law, such as by good faith
purchase or adverse possession. Which means one cannot acquire a valid title
from a thief. As we

shall see, good faith purchase and adverse possession are
the main exceptions to _nemo dat_.

3 .Does the adoption of _nemo dat_ as the baseline rule for
determining the quantum of rights obtained by transfer serve to promote the
free

alienation of property? If so, how? For a discussion of
_nemo dat_ and current and potential approaches to managing exceptions to it,
see Donald J.

Kochan, Dealing with Dirty Deeds: Matching Nemo Dat
Preferences with Property Law Pragmatism, 64 U. Kan. L. Rev. 1 ( 2015 ).

### D. THE GOOD FAITH PURCHASER

The good faith purchaser doctrine represents an important
exception to nemo dat , one that plays a central role in all the remaining
materials

that will be considered in this Chapter. Suppose A sells
goods to B but for some reason the transaction is flawed. Let us suppose B paid
for the

goods with a check that bounces. B then turns around and
sells the same goods to C. As long as C purchases the goods in good faith, that
is,

without knowledge of the flaw in the A-to-B transaction, and
as long as C gives value—that is, the B-to-C transaction is not a gift—then the
law

will generally give C title to the goods as a good faith
purchaser. The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) recognizes both the nemo dat
principle

and the good faith purchaser exception in the following
provision:

§ 2–403.

(1) A purchaser of goods acquires all title which his
transferor had or had power to transfer except that a purchaser of a limited
interest

acquires rights only to the extent of the interest
purchased. A person with voidable title has power to transfer a good title to a
good

faith purchaser for value. When goods have been delivered
under a transaction of purchase the purchaser has such power even though

(a)the transferor was deceived as to the identity of the
purchaser, or

(b)the delivery was in exchange for a check which is later
dishonored, or

#881

(c)it was agreed that the transaction was to be a “cash
sale”, or

(d)the delivery was procured through fraud punishable as
larcenous under the criminal law.

Notice that the UCC limits the good faith purchaser doctrine
to circumstances in which the transferor (B in our hypothetical) has “voidable”

title. This is to be distinguished from “void” title.
Property acquired by theft is a primary example of void title. Void title gives
no power to create

rights in another ( nemo dat continues to apply). But
voidable title gives a power to transfer to a good faith purchaser for value.
Subdivisions (a)

through (d) of § 2–403 describe circumstances that the UCC
considers to create “voidable” title. For example, acquiring goods with a check
that

bounces or by means of fraud creates “voidable” title. The
UCC defines “purchase” broadly to mean “taking by sale, lease, discount,
negotiation,

mortgage, pledge, lien, security interest, issue or reissue,
gift, or any other voluntary transaction creating an interest in property.” §
1–201(29).

Nevertheless, those who take by gift usually cannot claim
the protections of the good faith purchaser rule, because they have not
purchased “for

value.”

#### Kotis v. Nowlin Jewelry, Inc.

```



Court of Appeals of Texas, 1992.



844 S.W. 2 d 920.



```

■
DRAUGHN, JUSTICE. Eddie Kotis appeals from a judgment declaring appellee,
Nowlin Jewelry, Inc., the sole owner of a Rolex watch, and

awarding appellee attorney’s fees. Kotis raises fourteen
points of error. We affirm.

On June 1 1, 1990, Steve Sitton acquired a gold ladies Rolex
watch, President model, with a diamond bezel from Nowlin Jewelry by forging

a check belonging to his brother and misrepresenting to
Nowlin that he had his brother’s authorization for the purchase. The purchase
price of the

watch, and the amount of the forged check, was $9,438.50.
The next day, Sitton telephoned Eddie Kotis, the owner of a used car
dealership, and

asked Kotis if he was interested in buying a Rolex watch.
Kotis indicated interest and Sitton came to the car lot. Kotis purchased the
watch for

$3,550.00. Kotis also called Nowlin’s Jewelry that same day
and spoke with Cherie Nowlin.

Ms. Nowlin told Kotis that Sitton had purchased the watch
the day before. Ms. Nowlin testified that Kotis would not immediately identify

himself. Because she did not have the payment information
available, Ms. Nowlin asked if she could call him back. Kotis then gave his
name and

number. Ms. Nowlin testified that she called Kotis and told
him the amount of the check and that it had not yet cleared. Kotis told Ms.
Nowlin

that he did not have the watch and that he did not want the
watch. Ms.

#882

Nowlin also testified that Kotis would not tell her how much
Sitton was asking for the watch.

John Nowlin, the president of Nowlin’s Jewelry, testified
that, after this call from Kotis, Nowlin’s bookkeeper began attempting to
confirm

whether the check had cleared. When they learned the check
would not be honored by the bank, Nowlin called Kotis, but Kotis refused to
talk to

Nowlin. Kotis referred Nowlin to his attorney. On June 25,
1990, Kotis’ attorney called Nowlin and suggested that Nowlin hire an attorney
and

allegedly indicated that Nowlin could buy the watch back
from Kotis. Nowlin refused to repurchase the watch.

After Sitton was indicted for forgery and theft, the
district court ordered Nowlin’s Jewelry to hold the watch until there was an
adjudication

of the ownership of the watch. Nowlin then filed suit
seeking a declaratory judgment that Nowlin was the sole owner of the watch.
Kotis filed a

counterclaim for a declaration that Kotis was a good faith
purchaser of the watch and was entitled to possession and title of the watch.
After a

bench trial, the trial court rendered judgment declaring
Nowlin the sole owner of the watch. The trial court also filed Findings of Fact
and

Conclusions of Law.

In point of error one, Kotis claims the trial court erred in
concluding that Sitton did not receive the watch through a transaction of
purchase

with Nowlin, within the meaning of Tex.Bus. & Com.Code
Ann. § 2.403(a). Where a party challenges a trial court’s conclusions of law,
we may

sustain the judgment on any legal theory supported by the
evidence. Incorrect conclusions of law will not require reversal if the
controlling

findings of facts will support a correct legal theory.

Kotis contends there is evidence that the watch is a “good”
under the UCC, there was a voluntary transfer of the watch, and there was

physical delivery of the watch. Thus, Kotis maintains that
the transaction between Sitton and Nowlin was a transaction of purchase such
that

Sitton acquired the ability to transfer good title to a good
faith purchaser under § 2.403.

Section 2.403 provides:

A purchaser of goods acquires all title which his transferor
had or had power to transfer except that a purchaser of a limited interest

acquires rights only to the extent of the interest
purchased. A person with voidable title has power to transfer good title to a
good faith

purchaser for value. When goods have been delivered under a
transaction of purchase the purchaser has such power even though

(1)the transferor was deceived as to the identity of the
purchaser, or

(2)the delivery was in exchange for a check which is later
dishonored, or

#883

(3)it was agreed that the transaction was to be a “cash
sale”, or

(4)the delivery was procured through fraud punishable as
larcenous under the criminal law.

Tex.Bus. & Com.Code Ann. § 2.403(a) (Vernon 1968).

Neither the code nor case law defines the phrase
“transaction of purchase.” “Purchase” is defined by the code as a “taking by
sale, discount,

negotiation, mortgage, pledge, lien, issue or reissue, gift
or any other voluntary transaction creating an interest in property.” Tex.Bus.
&

Com.Code Ann. § 1.201(32) (Vernon 1968). Thus, only
voluntary transactions can constitute transactions of purchase.

Having found no Texas case law concerning what constitutes a
transaction of purchase under § 2.403(a), we have looked to case law from

other states. Based on the code definition of a purchase as
a voluntary transaction, these cases reason that a thief who wrongfully takes
the goods

against the will of the owner is not a purchaser. See
Suburban Motors, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 268 Cal.Rptr. 16,
18 (Cal. Ct.

App. 1990); Charles Evans BMW, Inc. v. Williams, 395 S.E.2d
650, 651–52 (Ga. Ct. App. 1990); Inmi-Etti v. Aluisi, 492 A.2d 917, 922 (Md.
Ct.

Spec. App. 1985). On the other hand, a swindler who
fraudulently induces the victim to deliver the goods voluntarily is a purchaser
under the

code. Inmi-Etti, 492 A.2d at 922; Williams, 395 S.E.2d at
652.

In this case, Nowlin’s Jewelry voluntarily delivered the
watch to Sitton in return for payment by check that was later discovered to be

forged. Sitton did not obtain the watch against the will of
the owner. Rather, Sitton fraudulently induced Nowlin’s Jewelry to deliver the
watch

voluntarily. Thus, we agree with appellant that the trial
court erred in concluding that Sitton did not receive the watch through a
transaction of

purchase under § 2.403(a). We sustain point of error one.

In point of error two, Kotis contends the trial court erred
in concluding that, at the time Sitton sold the watch to Kotis, Sitton did not
have at

least voidable title to the watch. In point of error nine,
Kotis challenges the trial court’s conclusion that Nowlin’s Jewelry had legal
and equitable

title at all times relevant to the lawsuit. The lack of
Texas case law addressing such issues under the code again requires us to look
to case law

from other states to assist in our analysis.

In Suburban Motors, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins.
Co., the California court noted that § 2.403 provides for the creation of

voidable title where there is a voluntary transfer of goods.
268 Cal.Rptr. at 18. Section 2.403(a)(1)–(4) set forth the types of voluntary

transactions that can give the purchaser voidable title.
Where goods are stolen such that there is no voluntary transfer, only void
title results. Id. at

19; Inmi-Etti, 492 A.2d at 921. Subsection (4) provides that
a purchaser can obtain voidable title to the goods even if “delivery was
procured

through fraud

#884

punishable as larcenous under the criminal law.” Tex.Bus.
& Com.Code Ann. § 2.403(a)(4) (Vernon 1968). This subsection applies to
cases

involving acts fraudulent to the seller such as where the
seller delivers the goods in return for a forged check. See Inmi-Etti, 492 A.2d
at 921.

Although Sitton paid Nowlin’s Jewelry with a forged check,
he obtained possession of the watch through a voluntary transaction of purchase
and

received voidable, rather than void, title to the watch.
Thus, the trial court erred in concluding that Sitton received no title to the
watch and in

concluding that Nowlin’s retained title at all relevant
times. We sustain points of error two and nine.

In point of error three, Kotis claims the trial court erred
in concluding that Kotis did not give sufficient value for the watch to receive

protection under § 2.403, that Kotis did not take good title
to the watch as a good faith purchaser, that Kotis did not receive good title
to the

watch, and that Kotis is not entitled to the watch under § 2
.403. In points of error four through eight, Kotis challenges the trial court’s
findings

regarding his good faith, his honesty in fact, and his
actual belief, and the reasonableness of the belief, that the watch had been
received

unlawfully.

Under § 2.403(a), a transferor with voidable title can
transfer good title to a good faith purchaser. Tex.Bus. & Com.Code Ann. §
2.403(a)

(Vernon 1968). Good faith means “honesty in fact in the
conduct or transaction concerned.” Tex.Bus. & Com.Code Ann. § 1.201(19)
(Vernon

1968). The test for good faith is the actual belief of the
party and not the reasonableness of that belief. La Sara Grain v. First Nat’l
Bank, 673

S.W.2d 558, 563 (Tex. 1984).

Kotis was a dealer in used cars and testified that he had
bought several cars from Sitton in the past and had no reason not to trust
Sitton. He

also testified that on June 12, 1990, Sitton called and
asked Kotis if he was interested in buying a Ladies Rolex. Once Kotis indicated
his interest

in the watch, Sitton came to Kotis’s place of business.
According to Kotis, Sitton said that he had received $18,000.00 upon the sale
of his house

and that he had used this to purchase the watch for his
girlfriend several months before. Kotis paid $3,550.00 for the watch. Kotis
further testified

that he then spoke to a friend, Gary Neal Martin, who also
knew Sitton. Martin sagely advised Kotis to contact Nowlin’s to check whether
Sitton

had financed the watch. Kotis testified that he called
Nowlin’s after buying the watch.

Cherie Nowlin testified that she received a phone call from
Kotis on June 12, 1990, although Kotis did not immediately identify himself.

Kotis asked if Nowlin’s had sold a gold President model
Rolex watch with a diamond bezel about a month before. When asked, Kotis told
Ms.

Nowlin that Sitton had come to Kotis’ car lot and was trying
to sell the watch. Ms. Nowlin testified that Kotis told her he did not want the
watch

because he already owned a Rolex. Ms. Nowlin told Kotis that
Sitton had purchased the watch the day before. Kotis asked about the method of

#885

payment. Because Ms. Nowlin did not know, she agreed to
check and call Kotis back. She called Kotis back and advised him that Sitton
had paid

for the watch with a check that had not yet cleared. When
Ms. Nowlin asked if Kotis had the watch, Kotis said no and would not tell her
how

much Sitton was asking for the watch. Ms. Nowlin did advise
Kotis of the amount of the check.

After these calls, the owner of Nowlin’s asked his
bookkeeper to call the bank regarding Sitton’s check. They learned on June 15,
1990 that

the check would be dishonored. John Nowlin called Kotis the
next day and advised him about the dishonored check. Kotis refused to talk to

Nowlin and told Nowlin to contact his attorney. Nowlin also
testified that a reasonable amount to pay for a Ladies President Rolex watch
with a

diamond bezel in mint condition was $7,000.00–$8,000.00.
Nowlin maintained that $3,500.00 was an exorbitantly low price for a watch like
this.

The trier of fact is the sole judge of the credibility of
the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony. Kotis testified that
he lied

when he spoke with Cherie Nowlin and that he had already
purchased the watch before he learned that Sitton’s story was false. The judge,
as the

trier of fact, may not have believed Kotis when he said that
he had already purchased the watch. If the judge disbelieved this part of
Kotis’

testimony, other facts tend to show that Kotis did not
believe the transaction was lawful. For example, when Kotis spoke with
Nowlin’s, he

initially refused to identify himself, he said that he did
not have the watch and that he did not want the watch, he refused to divulge
Sitton’s

asking price, and he later refused to talk with Nowlin and
advised Nowlin to contact Kotis’ attorney. Thus, there is evidence supporting
the trial

court’s finding that Kotis did not act in good faith.

There are sufficient facts to uphold the trial court’s
findings even if the judge had accepted as true Kotis’ testimony that, despite
his

statements to Nowlin’s, he had already purchased the watch
when he called Nowlin’s. The testimony indicated that Kotis was familiar with
the

price of Rolex watches and that $3,550.00 was an extremely
low price for a mint condition watch of this type. An unreasonably low price is

evidence the buyer knows the goods are stolen. Although the
test is what Kotis actually believed, we agree with appellee that we need not
let this

standard sanction willful disregard of suspicious facts that
would lead a reasonable person to believe the transaction was unlawful. Thus,
we find

sufficient evidence to uphold the trial court’s findings
regarding Kotis’ lack of status as a good faith purchaser. We overrule points
of error three

through eight. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .If Sitton had broken into the Nowlins’ shop and taken the
watch or ripped it out of their hands and ran off with it, he would have been a
thief. In

such a case he would have no title at all in the watch (void
title). But

```



886



```

because he paid with a forged check, he had voidable title,
meaning that he had the power to give good title to a good faith purchaser for
value. From the

point of view of someone like Kotis, why does it matter
whether Sitton is a thief or a fraudster? Or is the difference what we expect
of the Nowlins in

terms of guarding against theft versus fraud?

2 .In this case the appellate court was called upon to
review the factual determination that Kotis did not satisfy the good faith
requirement. It is

likely that all the judges strongly suspected Kotis knew his
seller’s rights to the watch were problematic. However, precisely because no
one can get

inside Kotis’s head, and Kotis adamantly claims to be a good
faith purchaser, the question becomes in part what kind of notice Kotis had of
the flaw in

Sitton’s title. Sometimes varieties of notice are
distinguished. Someone with _actual notice_ knows of the relevant fact, here
the fraud in the prior sale.

One can lack actual notice but have a form of constructive
notice called _inquiry notice_ , which means that a reasonable person knowing
what one does

know would have engaged in further inquiry, and this further
inquiry would likely have led to actual knowledge of the relevant fact. A
registry, as in the

case of land and a few types of personal property, is said
to give a form of constructive notice called _record notice_ of the relevant
fact. One who has a

duty to search title records will be deemed to know relevant
facts disclosed by the records even if that person does not in fact inspect the
records. What

kind of notice, if any, did Kotis have?

3 .The proper scope of the good faith purchaser exception to
_nemo dat_ is a matter of controversy. The crux of the problem is that three
parties are

involved—the original owner, the bad actor who gains
possession from the original owner in a wrongful fashion, and the innocent
purchaser. Everyone

agrees that the optimal solution is to force the bad actor
to make everyone whole. But the problem is that the bad actor is usually gone
or judgment-

proof, and so we have to decide as between two comparatively
innocent parties—the original owner and the innocent purchaser—who should bear
the

loss. One way to frame the question is to ask who as a
general matter is in a better position to avoid the loss: the original owner or
the potential good

faith purchaser? Does the answer change depending on the
situation, such that theft is covered by one rule, fraud by another, and
purchases from an open

street market by a third? Saul Levmore surveys a range of
answers to these questions, in legal systems both ancient and modern. He
hypothesizes that

this is a case in which the question whether to impose the
loss on the original owner or the innocent purchaser is a close one and
evidence about who

ought to bear the loss in any given case is hard to come by;
hence we see a variety of approaches across time and space to the good faith
purchaser. Saul

Levmore, Variety and Uniformity in the Treatment of the
Good-Faith Purchaser, 16 J. Legal Stud. 43 ( 1987 ). For example, U.S. law is
less favorable to

the good faith purchaser than is civil law. See also
Giuseppe Dari-Mattiacci & Carmine Guerriero, Law and Culture: A Theory of
Comparative Variation

in Bona Fide Purchase Rules, 35 Oxford J. Legal Stud. 543 (
2015 ) (arguing that the variation in good faith purchaser rules can be traced
to deep cultural

differences and, in particular, different assumptions about
individual self-reliance).

```

■
RUDOLPH, JUDGE. Although in form an action to quiet title, the real purpose of
this action is to cancel and set aside a certain mineral deed

admittedly signed by plaintiff and certain other deeds
transferring the mineral rights by the grantee named in the original deed. No
one has

questioned the form of the action. The trial court entered
judgment cancelling the deeds and defendants have appealed.

Cancellation was asked because of alleged fraud, and it was
upon this basis that the trial court entered its judgment. The defendants

contend, first, that there was no fraud and second, that the
mineral rights were transferred to a bona fide purchaser for value and are not,

therefore, subject to cancellation even though obtained by
fraud in the first instance.

The facts most favorable in support of the judgment of the
trial court are as follows: Plaintiff is a farmer owning and operating a farm

located partly in South Dakota and partly in North Dakota.
He lives on that part of the farm located in South Dakota in McPherson County.

Plaintiff is 44 years old, has an 8th grade education,
married and has a family. His farm consists of two sections of land which he
purchased at

three different times.

On May 23 , 1951, while plaintiff was at a neighbor’s place,
three men approached him and discussed leasing plaintiff’s land for oil and
gas.

A Mr. Crawford was the principal spokesman. Plaintiff
testified that after some discussion Crawford offered 25¢ an acre for a lease.
Plaintiff

agreed, and one of the men apparently prepared the necessary
papers on a typewriter while sitting in the back seat of the car. When the
papers

were prepared they were clamped to a board or pad and
presented to plaintiff while in the car for signing. Printed forms were used
which

contained much fine print. The man who prepared the papers
indicated where plaintiff should sign, and after signing in one place,
partially turned

the signed sheet and asked plaintiff to sign again, stating
that this second sheet was a part of the lease, which plaintiff believed.
Plaintiff testified

that no mention was ever made of a mineral deed and to this
extent is corroborated by Crawford who in response to the question, “Did you
ever

describe to Mr. Hauck one of the instruments as a mineral
deed?”, answered, “No, sir.” Separate instruments were required for the land in
each

state. Plaintiff never received a copy of any of the
instruments he signed.

It now appears that somehow plaintiff had signed a mineral
deed conveying one-half the minerals in his land to D. W. Crawford. This deed

was filed for record June 1, 1951, but on May 29, 1951,
Crawford, the grantee, conveyed such mineral rights to the defendants White and

Duncan at [Gainesville], Texas. The trial court made no
finding relating

#888

to the knowledge of White and Duncan concerning the
conditions under which Duncan obtained the deed, but decided the case on the
basis that

they were in fact bona fide purchasers for value. This
statement of the facts is sufficient for our present purpose.

We are concerned with a type of fraud which the trial court,
texts and decided cases refer to as “fraud in the factum” or “fraud in the

execution” as distinguished from “fraud in the inducement.”
This type of fraud relates to misrepresentation of the contents of a document
by

which one is induced to sign a paper thinking that it is
other than it really is. It was this type of fraud with which this court was
dealing in the

case of Federal Land Bank v. Houck, 4 N.W.2d 213, 218 (S.D.
1942). In this cited case we held that, as between the original parties, when a

person is fraudulently induced to sign a paper believing
that it is something other than it really is “the contractual knot was never
tied” and such

paper or instrument is not only voidable but actually void.
In that case it was further held in conformity with prior holdings that
“neither reason

nor policy justifies the reception of a showing of
negligence on the part of him who is overreached, as a countervailent or
neutralizer of fraud.” In

other words, the perpetrator of the fraud cannot avoid his
acts by a showing that the person upon whom the fraud was committed was
negligent.

The Houck case, we are convinced, settles the issue of
fraud. Accepting as a verity testimony of the plaintiff the misrepresentation
and

trickery of Crawford was complete. Crawford not only
misrepresented the effect of the papers plaintiff signed, but by “manipulation
of the

papers” as found by the trial court tricked plaintiff into
signing the deed thinking it was the lease. Under the rule of the Houck case
plaintiff’s

negligence, if any, does not neutralize this fraud. As
stated in the Houck case there was “no intention to do the act or say the words
which

manifest a volition to assent.” It must therefore be held
that as between Hauck, the grantor, and Crawford, the grantee, the deed was
void.

The deed being void as distinguished from voidable it had no
effect whatsoever, conveyed nothing to Crawford, and he in turn had nothing

to convey to White and Duncan. As stated by Judge McCoy in
the case of Highrock v. Gavin, 179 N.W. 12, 23 (S.D. 1920),

The grantee under this void deed was as powerless to
transmit title as would be the thief of stolen property. Said deed had no more

force or effect than a forged deed, and, in principle, was
legally analogous to a forged deed. The recording statutes furnish no

protection to those who claim as innocent purchasers under a
forged or otherwise void deed, where the true owner has been guilty of

no negligence or acts sufficient to create an estoppel.

Throughout these proceedings appellant has contended that
plaintiff is an intelligent farmer, operating a large farm, and that if he
failed to

detect the fact that he signed a deed such failure was due
to his negligence and therefore he should not be permitted to prevail in these

#889

proceedings. We have pointed out above that plaintiff’s
negligence will not neutralize the fraud, or give validity to the deed, but we
are

convinced that this holding is not decisive as against a
purchaser for value without notice. As indicated in the Highrock-Gavin case,
supra, even

though the deed is void if plaintiff were negligent or
committed acts sufficient to create an estoppel he should bear the brunt of
such negligence,

rather than a bona fide purchaser.

An “estoppel” arises when, by his conduct or acts, a party
intentionally or through culpable neglect induces another to believe certain

facts to exist, and such other party rightfully relies and
acts on such belief so that he will be prejudiced if the former is permitted to

deny the existence of such facts.

Lambert v. Bradley, 42 N.W.2d 606, 607 (S.D. 1950).

As applied to civil actions the words “culpable negligence”
mean the same as actionable negligence. The action being in form an action to

quiet title there was no opportunity for appellants to plead
an estoppel. There being no opportunity to plead it, the defense is not waived.

As we view this case, therefore, we must revert to the issue
of whether plaintiff was negligent when he affixed his signature to this deed
not

knowing that it was a deed he signed. On this issue the
trial court made no specific determination. Whether plaintiff was negligent
under all the

facts and circumstances presented by this record we believe
to be a question of fact which should be determined by the trial court. The
question

is, did plaintiff act as a person of reasonable and ordinary
care, endowed with plaintiff’s capacity and intelligence, would usually act
under like

circumstances?

We are not inclined to accept the trial court’s holding that
the manner in which plaintiff’s signature was obtained constituted a forgery.
As

disclosed by the notes in 14 A.L.R. 316 and 56 A.L.R. 5 82,
such holding is a minority view, and seems to us unsound. We believe the rule
we

have announced in Federal Land Bank v. Houck, supra, and in
this opinion will better sustain the ends of justice. Our holding, we believe,

recognizes actualities. The signature was the real signature
of the plaintiff. True, plaintiff was induced to sign by a false
representation, but to

hold a signature thus obtained a forgery seems artificial
and out of harmony with the actual facts.

The judgment appealed from is reversed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .This case illustrates the doctrinal variability that
enters into good faith purchaser doctrine, especially in the context of real
property, where the

UCC does not apply. How would the case be analyzed if it
were a purchase of goods covered by the UCC? Real property transactions tainted
by “fraud

in the execution” are often held to be void whereas
transactions tainted by “fraud in the inducement” are voidable, opening up the
possibility that a good

```



890



```

faith purchaser can acquire good title. Does this approach
to “void” and “voidable” make sense? Do you agree with the court’s conclusion
in _Hauck_ that

the question of Hauck’s negligence is critical to whether
the Texas transferees (White and Duncan) should be able to keep the mineral
rights as good

faith purchasers? Why should the application of the doctrine
turn on Hauck’s behavior, rather than Crawford’s? For a proposal to make owner

negligence a factor in applying good faith purchaser rules,
see Alan Schwartz & Robert Scott, Rethinking the Laws of Good Faith
Purchase, 111 Colum.

L. Rev. 1332 ( 2011 ). For a survey of approaches to good
faith purchase in various areas of law, see Stephen L. Sepinuck, The Various
Standards for the

Good Faith of a Purchaser, 73 Bus. Law. 581 ( 2018 ).

2 .In the “eternal triangle” of original owner, wrongdoer,
and good faith purchaser for value, the dilemma usually is that the wrongdoer
is absent or

judgment-proof, leaving two innocent parties as potential
bearers of the loss. (This would have been the situation in the _Kotis_ case if
Kotis had been an

innocent party; Sitton’s check bounced and he was presumably
not good for the damages.) Here Hauck managed to drag Crawford into court. Do
you

think Crawford’s availability had an impact on the result?
Assuming Crawford still has the proceeds from the sale and is not insolvent,
how should

Hauck’s claim against Crawford for damages come out? How
adequate are damages to farmer Hauck? Note that Crawford could be sued under a

constructive trust theory, under which Crawford would be
deemed to hold the proceeds in trust for Hauck. Under the approach of the new
_Restatement

Third, Restitution and Unjust Enrichment_ , Crawford, as a
conscious wrongdoer, would be liable not just to return the proceeds he
fraudulently acquired

from Hauck but also any traceable further proceeds (say,
race track winnings) he derived from them. Id. § 59.

3 .How is a subsequent purchaser supposed to know that a
deed like that from Hauck to Crawford was void? Crawford and his sons
apparently

were on a fraud spree along the border between the Dakotas.
In another case involving the Crawfords and some of the same third-party
grantees (but

another farming couple as victims), the North Dakota Supreme
Court, after expressing some skepticism about whether there was fraud (as the
trial court

had found), held that the deed in question was voidable,
thus allowing the good faith purchasers to acquire good title. Hoffer v.
Crawford, 65 N.W. 2 d

625 (N.D. 1954 ). The North Dakota court, acknowledging the
approach in the South Dakota case, endorsed a standard highly protective of
good faith

purchasers under which “ ‘the innocent purchaser should be
protected unless the fraud is _clear, unequivocal, and its force undiminished
by lack of care

on the part of a mentally competent, defrauded grantor_ .’ ”
Id. at 631 (quoting Dixon v. Kaufman, 58 N.W. 2 d 797 , 805 (N.D. 1953 ),
emphasis supplied

by the court in _Hoffer_ ). Is such a rule protecting good
faith purchasers where original owners have shown lack of care in the face of
fraud better than

applying more discretionary notions of estoppel to owners
like Hauck? Keep this question in mind when we take up land records later in
this Chapter.

Forgeries and frauds are but some of the “off-record risks”
in the land records.

```



891



```

4 .Another application of “estoppel” involves the doctrine
of estoppel by deed. Say A, who does not own Blackacre, gives B a deed for
Blackacre.

Then A acquires Blackacre. Can A prevail over B by claiming
under _nemo dat_ not to have conveyed anything to B? No: Under estoppel by
deed, A is

prevented from claiming superior title to his grantee. Under
another version of the doctrine, title automatically passes to B when A finally
acquires

Blackacre.

### E. PROVING OWNERSHIP

In this Part we consider the system of records for a variety
of types of property. Even under nemo dat apart from its exceptions, a
purchaser

would like to know if the title she is being offered is
valid—whether the transferor really has the rights to transfer. To the extent
we move away

from nemo dat and allow good faith purchasers to establish
title by routes other than the nemo dat principle, we also face the question of
what

constitutes notice and how to provide notice in a way that
is generally cost-effective. In any event, for various resources the issue is
what

combination of possession, markings on the asset, and
records (and of what type) is most cost-effective. Moreover, when things go
wrong, courts

will often be faced ex post with potential unfairness in the
operation of some of these systems.

Uncertainty, and the Transfer of Property

```



13 J. LEGAL STUD. 299 , 302 – 04 ( 1984 ).



```

Anglo-American law assumes for the most part that an
individual’s interest in enjoying property that is acquired, in good faith,
from

someone else who appears to be the owner is not as important
as recognizing the rights of the person who first owned it or who last owned it
by

wholly consensual transfers. Nevertheless, we shall want to
ensure, even in a legal regime that conditions ownership on consensual
transfer, that

legal rules make it easy for prospective purchasers to
investigate their chain of title. Consent, although usually a necessary
condition, is rarely a

sufficient one.

At one time, taking physical possession of real or tangible
personal property was necessary before a person could be relatively certain
that

his claim was, and would remain, superior to that of others.
This principle was affirmed in the case of personal property in 1601 in Twyne’s
Case.

A person had purported to sell some sheep, but he had
continued to take care of them, shear them, and treat them as his own. The
court struck the

transaction down as fraudulent, essentially on the ground
that there was something wrong with selling goods but keeping possession of
them.

Since the transaction would have been valid had the property
been physically transferred at the time of the sale, the sale itself was not at
issue.

Rather, the sticking point was the retention of possession.
The

#892

problem with retention of possession—ostensible
ownership—ultimately seems to return to a legal rule governing information as a
means of

reducing uncertainty. * * *

The system illustrated in Twyne’s Case depended on a very
simple legal rule and hence on minimal government intervention: to obtain

priority in an asset over third-party claimants, an
individual needed, in addition to the consent of the prior owner, to take
physical possession of

the asset. Under such a system, both obtaining information
regarding prior claims and disseminating information regarding one’s own claim
were

simple—one took possession. Between the parties to a
transaction, such as a lender and the true owner, their private contract
governed. But

against most of the rest of the world, possession was also
necessary.

Establishing ownership rights from possession, however,
brings costs. A possession-based rule, for example, impedes temporal divisions
of

ownership of property. Under such a rule, one who acquires a
remainder interest cannot easily take possession of the underlying property and

ensure that his rights are superior to the rights of anyone
else to whom his transferor might also try to convey the remainder interest.
Moreover, a

possession-based rule of title makes the tracing of claims
for more than one generation difficult and hence increases the risks of a thief
in the

chain of title—a risk that one or the other party must bear.
Certain attributes of particular kinds of property, in addition, may make such
property

more suitable to a system of filing claims to provide the
relevant information.

Filing systems have evolved as the principal alternative to
transfer rules based on possession. Public recording of interests in property
may

reduce the uncertainty concerning the transfer of property,
because they contain virtually all relevant information, apart from that
imparted by

possession itself. Filing systems may also aid in the
tracing of transfers over time and hence, compared to a possession-based
system, reduce the

risk of non-consensual transfers at the same time that they
provide assurance to subsequent purchasers that they can in fact acquire good
title. In

short, rules of transfer that require public recordation can
reduce the risks that a subsequent purchaser will not acquire good title
without

increasing the risk that a present owner will lose his
property by theft.

Filing systems can be mixed in a variety of ways with
possessory systems for determining rights to assets. * * *

Filing systems are not, however, equally suited to all kinds
of property. The desirability of a particular kind of filing system turns on
the

type of property it is to cover. Filing systems are
comparatively better than possessory systems when the property is valuable,
when the property

is not transferred often, and when it is important to share
ownership of the property among several individuals, such as by creating a
future

interest or a security interest. Filing systems, moreover,
are comparatively better when the property’s physical use is important or when
the

underlying property right is abstract and unembodied. In
such

#893

cases, requiring a transfer of possession as a condition of
acquiring paramount rights to the asset brings with it substantial costs that
do not

outweigh the significant benefits of allowing one party to
remain in possession despite his holding less than full ownership of the
property. Filing

systems, finally, will more easily accommodate title claims
to an asset, and not just security claims, when describing the property
identifies it

more precisely than possessing it, when the asset has a long
life, and when the property (or perhaps the debtor) is not likely to move. When
these

conditions hold, finding the property files and using them
are comparatively easy and cost effective.

Some types of property seem better suited for one set of
transfer rules than another. Real property is the paradigm of property for
which a

filing system of title claims is superior. One acquires
ownership of Blackacre by engaging in certain public acts. This permits others
who come

later to discover the true owner easily, and hence
facilitates consensual transfers by holders along the chain of title. As a
first approximation, one

has exclusive ownership of Blackacre to the extent that no
one else, outside the chain of title, has engaged in those acts before, and one
can learn

about all such earlier acts, because notations in a filing
system are both permanent and publicly accessible. * * *

The provisions requiring the recording of transfers of title
to real property deal successfully with the need of potential purchasers of

property for reliable information about who owns the land
they wish to acquire. The recording system has the effect of reducing the
uncertainty

surrounding a transfer of real property without undermining
the consensual nature of those transfers. And the more effective the set of
rules

governing the transfer of property is in increasing
acquisitional certainty and dispositional certainty, the more valuable it is to
own property in the

first instance.

But not all types of property are equally suited to an
informational system based on files. Money is the polar opposite of real
property in that

it is the best example of property that is not suitable for
a filing system * * *

Other kinds of personal property provide intermediate cases.
Recording systems that establish title of personal property are rare, at least

when the owner is in possession of the property. The
informational advantages that such a system provides do not, as a general
matter, seem

worth their costs. A piece of personal property is often
less valuable than a piece of real property and is likely to be more frequently
transferred.

Moreover, a title-based recording system is much harder to
organize for grain in a silo than it is for land. One has no easy way of
knowing that

this was the grain grown on Blackacre in one jurisdiction or
on Whiteacre in another. Possession is often more reliable than description in
sorting

personal property. One also has no easy way of knowing in
fact that the grain in the silo today was the grain that was there yesterday.
Grain or

#894

its owner can easily move from one jurisdiction to another,
and prospective purchasers may not know which file to check. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .How critical is the practice of secured lending (see
Chapter VII) to the development of filing systems for property rights? Most of
the types of

property that are covered by filing systems are also used as
security for loans. This includes land and associated real property interests,
major forms of

personal property like airplanes and automobiles, and
patents. Indeed, many types of personal property (such as machinery) are the
subject of recording

only if they are used as security for loans. On the other
hand, property interests that are not often used as security for loans, like
works of art, have been

slower to develop registries. Does the fact that security
interests are invisible help explain why registration or recording is necessary
in order for secured

lending to flourish? How important is taxation in explaining
the development of systematic title records for property rights? If the
government were to

rely heavily on personal property taxes on works of fine
art, would you expect a system of registration to emerge for these works? How
important is it

that property be difficult to alter in the development of a
registration system? See Abraham Bell & Gideon Parchomovsky, Of Property
and Information,

116 Colum. L. Rev. 237 , 280 – 81 ( 2016 ).

2 .Possession and title records are meant to serve as notice
to “all the world,” but among that large class of persons some will need more

information than others. Potential purchasers often need the
most, and the title records are designed for their use—or for the experts they
hire. How

accessible do title records need to be? Does a potential
trespasser need to look up the state of title? See, e.g., Mountain States Tel.
& Tel. Co. v. Kelton,

285 P. 2 d 168 , 170 – 71 (Ariz. 1955 ) (holding that
contractor is not deemed to have constructive notice of buried cable that was
subject of recorded right

of way because those with no interest in the title are not
bound to search title to land); Statler Mfg., Inc. v. Brown, 691 S.W. 2 d 445 ,
449 – 50 (Mo. Ct.

App. 1985 ) (holding no constructive notice to contractor
from properly recorded easement for aircraft right-of-way).

3 .As you read the materials in the balance of this Chapter,
ask yourself whether Baird and Jackson are too optimistic about the
effectiveness of the

recording system for property in land. See, e.g., D. Barlow
Burke, Jr., American Conveyancing Patterns: Past Improvements and Current
Debates 103 –

04 & n. 2 ( 1978 ) (noting the many risks that American
recording systems give rise to and how little protection a title search
provides, and citing

literature); Francis S. Philbrick, Limits of Record Search
and Therefore of Notice: Part I, 93 U. Pa. L. Rev. 125 ( 1944 ).

### 1 .LAND

The keeping of land records is a practice both old and new.
In the ancient Near East, records of land transactions and ownership were

sometimes kept in the household—as, for example, attested by
the story of Jeremiah’s purchase in 587 B.C. of a field at Anathoth from his

cousin

#895

Hanamel (Jer. 32:9–15)—and sometimes in central registries.
In ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, the centralized records were probably kept
for

purposes like tax collection rather than to bar the claims
of third parties. Robert C. Ellickson & Charles DiA. Thorland, Ancient Land
Law:

Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel, 71 Chi.–Kent L. Rev. 321, 373,
380–81, 384–85 (1995).

Land records designed to cut off the contrary claims of
third parties are a more recent development, which came earlier to the United
States

than to England. The first American recording act was the
1640 Massachusetts Bay recording statute, whose preamble states the act’s
purpose as

“[f]or avoyding fraudulent conveyances, and that every man
may know what estate or interest other men have.” 6 Powell on Real Property ¶
912

(1949) (quoting 1 Massachusetts Records at 306). In England,
deeds were kept by owners and later by lawyers; concerns with privacy are

thought to have delayed large-scale recording until the
twentieth century. Even the major overhaul of English property in the English
Land

Registration Act of 1925 contained provisions for secrecy.
C. Dent Bostick, Land Title Registration: An English Solution to an American

Problem, 63 Ind. L.J. 55, 75–76 99–100 (1987) (arguing
against these secrecy provisions for the United States). Might privacy
considerations re-

emerge to change land recording institutions in the near
future? With the rise of computerized land recording, some firms have begun
extracting

and commodifying the data in land records to sell the
personal and financial data these records reveal, often for targeted marketing.
See Reid K.

Weisbord & Stewart E. Sterk, The Commodification of
Public Land Records, 97 Notre Dame L. Rev. (forthcoming), https://ssrn.com/

abstract=3794846.

Land records make notice by publicizing transactions—a
method in evidence in the Hebrew Bible, the Middle Assyrian Laws, and medieval

English sources—less necessary and increasingly vestigial.
(Recall livery of seisin and the handing over of the twig or clod of dirt in
the sale of a

freehold estate, see Chapter V.) Nevertheless, notice by
possession has not completely died out. Consider in the following materials the
role of

possession in furnishing notice to third-party potential
purchasers.

Private Titling: Privacy of Claims as the Starting Point

Under the Roman Law tradition of private conveyance that was
dominant in Europe until the nineteenth century, private contracts on land

had in rem effects on third parties, even if they were kept
secret. The baseline legal principle was that no one could deliver what they
did not

have (nemo dat quod non habet) , which was closely related
to the

#896

principle “first in time, first in right.” So, in a double
sale * * * in which an owner O sells first to buyer B 1 and later to B 2 , the
land belongs to B 1

because when O sold to B 2 , O was not the owner. In cases
of conflict, the judge will allocate property and contract rights between both
claimants

( B 1 and B 2 )—that is, will “establish title”—on the basis
of evidence on possession and past transactions, whether or not these
transactions had

remained hidden.

This potential enforcement of adverse hidden rights made
gathering all relevant consents close to impossible, hindering trade and

specialization. Most transactions in land therefore gave
rise, totally or partially, to contract rights and the enforcement advantage of
property

rights remained unfulfilled, especially with respect to
abstract rights, such as mortgages. These difficulties are clear in the
functioning of the two

sources of evidence traditionally used to establish title
under privacy: possession and the “chain of title deeds.”

Reliance on Possession

First, the use of possession—that is, the fact of
controlling the asset—as the basis for establishing property rights is a poor
solution for

durable assets, because for such assets it is often valuable
to define multiple rights, at least separating ownership and possession.
However,

relying on possession to establish ownership makes it
possible for possessors to fraudulently use their position to acquire ownership
for

themselves or to convey owners’ rights to third parties. In
such cases, owners will often end up holding a mere contract right, an in
personam

right, against the possessor committing the fraud.
Understandably, under such conditions, owners will be reluctant to cede
possession

impersonally, for fear of losing their property. * * *

Documentary Formalization Through the Chain of Deeds

Second, some of the problems posed by possession are solved
by embodying abstract rights, such as ownership and liens, and even

complementary consents in the conveying contracts, which
then form a series or “chain” of title documents or deeds (“chain of deeds,”
for

brevity) that is based on what I have been calling
“documentary formalization.” This evidencing of rights with the chain of deeds
facilitates some

degree of separation of ownership and control because it is
the content and possession of deeds that provide evidence of ownership.
Therefore,

title experts can examine the history of transactions going
back to a “root of title” which is proof of ownership in itself—either because
it is an

original grant from the State or, more often, because of the
time that has lapsed beyond the period of prescription or the statute of
limitations.

This solution has also been used for a long time. For
example, in the Demotic titles used in Ptolemaic Egypt between 650 and 30 BCE,
the

consent of affected rightholders (usually the wife and
coheirs of the vendor) was stated in a specific clause (Manning 1995, 254–55).
But relying

on the chain of deeds also creates problems. Above all, new

#897

possibilities for error and fraudulent conveyance appear,
giving rise to multiple chains of title, which leave acquirers with contract
rights against

the fraudulent grantor and the professionals involved in the
transaction. Moreover, titles are less effective than possession in reducing
the

asymmetry of acquirers, as possession is observable but
adverse chains of title remain private to the acquirer. Furthermore, acquirers
remain fully

unprotected against those hidden charges that are not
voluntarily contracted, such as judgment and property tax liens. * * *

Traditional Conveyancing in England: Solicitors and the
Chain of Deeds. Despite these difficulties, transactions on unregistered land
in

England heavily relied on the chain of deeds up until the
last decades of the twentieth century. Typically, ownership was proved by
possession

and the whole series of deeds, which was often kept by the
owner’s solicitor. And mortgages were formalized by pledging the deeds with the

lender. This privacy system was able to survive, despite its
shortcomings, because agricultural land ownership was relatively concentrated
in a

few hands, which made personal transactions easier (Pottage
1998). In addition, the flaws of privacy were palliated in England by
parliamentary

interventions that reorganized obsolete and overly
fragmented property rights (Bogart and Richardson 2009), an example of
large-scale public

reallocation of rights.

The English case also illustrates a constant feature of
privacy regimes: to contain fraud, private conveyancing services provided by

solicitors and notaries tend to develop into professional
monopoly. * * *

Public Reallocation of Rights Through Judicial Purging of
Titles. In a situation of systematically unclear title, of the sort that may be

fostered by a privacy regime, many individuals demand that
the legal system afford them greater security for their rights, especially
owners who

plan to make additional investments or to sell land to third
parties who may be unsatisfied by personal guarantees. To fulfill this demand
for

greater security, legal systems often provide summary
judicial procedures that aim to call on all possible claimants and solve any
possible

contradiction in their claims, proceeding to what * * * is a
public reallocation of rights. For example, before the consolidation of
recordation and

registration systems, many countries in Europe resorted to
special judicial procedures for clarifying title, such as the French purge
(Cabrillac and

Mouly 1997, 732) and the Spanish purga (Pardo Núñez 1993).

Unsatisfied demand for greater security is also behind the
fake lawsuits that parties resort to with the objective of clarifying title
when the

law does not provide for specific summary procedures. A
famous example was the English “fine,” a simulated lawsuit that allowed the

transaction to be entered in the books of the court and made
it binding on everybody after a short period of limitation. It was used from
the

twelfth century until 1833 (Kolbert and Mackay 1977, 241).
This type of fictitious and amicable lawsuit is found in different historical
contexts,

from the Bible (Ellickson and Thorland 1995, 385) to
colonial

#898

Massachusetts (Konig 1974, 160–61). Unfortunately, however,
both specific purges and fake lawsuits are insecure under a privacy regime,

because judges must rely on proclamations to identify all
claims, given that many rights remain hidden. Therefore, their effects in many

jurisdictions are not general but are limited to any
identified claims.

Publicity of Claims

Whatever the palliatives applied, the costs of contracting
true property in rem rights under a regime of pure privacy are so high that
modern

systems of property law have abandoned privacy in an effort
to lower them. At a minimum, the law induces or requires the independent
publicity

of contracts, which makes them verifiable, as a prerequisite
for them to attain in rem effects—that is, to convey property rights and not
mere

contract rights. If they keep their claims private,
rightholders lose or risk losing in rem effects. Private contracts may create
obligations among

the conveying parties but do not bind third parties—all
other rightholders and, especially, potential future buyers and lenders.
Independent

publicity therefore facilitates finding out which property
rights are alive and which will be affected, thus making it possible to gather
consents,

purge titles, and reduce information asymmetries between the
conveying parties. * * *

Recordation of Deeds

The next logical step in the provision of publicity is to
deposit private transaction documents (“title deeds”) in a public registry so
that this

evidence on property claims can then be used by the courts
to verify them and allocate property, in rem , rights in case of litigation.
Moreover, by

making the register publicly accessible to potential
acquirers, these can ascertain the quality of the sellers’ title, thus reducing
their information

asymmetry.

After many failed attempts, such as the Statute of
Enrollments issued by Henry VIII in 1535 but never enforced, and the
Massachusetts

1640 Recording Act, recordation eventually started to
succeed in the nineteenth century and has been used in most of the United
States, part of

Canada, France, and some other countries, mostly those with
a French legal background. The key for its success was to switch the priority
rule,

because other incentives failed in convincing people to
record. Historically, recordation systems thus became effective only when, in
deciding on

a conflict with third parties, courts determined the
priority of claims from the date of recording in the public office and not from
the date of the

deed. This means that, instead of the conventional “first in
time, first in right” rule, courts adjudicated according to the rule “first to
record, first

in right.” For instance, in terms of a double sale * * * ,
the judge would give the land not to the first buyer, B 1 , but to the first
buyer to record the

purchase.

This change in the priority rule not only protects acquirers
but also avoids incomplete recording, which hampered many of the first

#899

recordation systems. The reason is that the switch in the
priority rule effectively motivates acquirers such as B 1 to record from fear
of losing title

through a second double sale or any other granting of rights
(e.g., a mortgage) by the former owner to an innocent acquirer such as B 2
(e.g., a

lender) who might record his claim first. Consequently, all
relevant evidence on property rights is available in the public records. From
the point

of view of third parties, the record, in principle, is
complete * * *. Other claims may not be recorded and may well be binding for
the parties

who have conveyed them, but these hidden claims have no
effect on third parties.^18

Moreover, as under the privacy regime, both contractual and
judicial procedures are used to remove title defects. Compared to privacy, deed

recordation provides more possibilities for contracting the
removal of defects, because defects are better known to buyers and insurers.
The

identification of rightholders also gives greater security
to the summary judicial hearings that serve to identify possible adverse claims
and

publicly reallocate in rem rights. These summary hearings
continue to exist today in, e.g., the French judicial purge and the US “quiet
title” suit.

In addition to purging titles directly, the existence of
such a court-ordered purging possibility also reduces bargaining costs
indirectly by

encouraging recalcitrant claimants to reach private
agreements (Cabrillac and Mouly 1997, 732–40).

However, the recording office accepts all deeds respecting
certain formal requirements (mainly, the date of the contract and the names of
the

conveying parties), whatever their legality and their
collision with preexisting property rights. In fact, the recording office is
often obliged by law

to file all documents fulfilling a set of formal
requirements, regardless of their legal status. For example, according to
Article 27201 of the

California Government Code, “the county recorder shall not
refuse to record any instrument, paper, or notice that is authorized or
required by

statute or court order to be recorded on the basis of its
lack of legal sufficiency.” The public record may therefore contain three kinds
of deed.

First, those resulting from private transactions made
without previous examination. Second, those granted after an examination but
without

having all defects removed. Finally, those that define
purged and non-contradictory property rights.

#900

Transactors who record clouded titles therefore produce a
negative externality for all future transactors.^20 Experts examining the title
of a

parcel do not know a priori which kinds of deed are recorded
concerning it. For each transaction, they will thus have to examine all
relevant

deeds dealing with that parcel in the past, even those which
may have been perfectly purged in previous transactions.

The cost of this repeated examining of deeds can be reduced
with proper organization of the registry. In the short run, the easiest way to

organize the information is by relying on indexes of
grantors and grantees to locate the chain of transactions for a given parcel.
However, this

method is subject to errors, such as, for example, those
caused by identical names and misspellings. * * *

Registration of Rights

Registration of rights (hereafter referred to as
“registration,” and often confusingly called “title registration”) goes one
crucial step further

than recordation of deeds: instead of providing information
about claims, it defines the rights. To do this, it performs a mandatory purge
of claims

before registering the rights. As in deed recordation,
claims stemming from private transactions gain priority when transaction
documents are

first lodged with the registry. They are then subject,
however, to substantive review by the registrar, in order to detect any
potential conflict that

might damage other property rights * * *. New and
reallocated rights are registered only when the registrar determines that the
intended

transaction does not affect any other property right or that
the holders of these affected rights have consented. When these conditions are
met, the

change in rights caused by the transaction is registered,
antedating the effects of registration to the lodging date. (In a sense, any
registry of rights

thus contains a recording of deeds: its “lodgment” or
“presentment” book is a temporary record of claims.) Otherwise, when the
consent of an

affected rightholder is lacking, registration is denied, and
the conveying parties have to obtain the consents relevant to the originally
intended

transaction, restructure it to avoid damaging other rights,
or desist.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .One can perhaps summarize Arruñada’s discussion of the
differences between registration and recordation as follows. Registration
resolves

potential disputes about title ex ante, at the time of the
transfer; recordation leaves disputes about title to be resolved ex post, once
they arise.

Registration confers rights in rem, in that the certificate
of title is binding on third parties as well as on the parties to the transfer.
Recordation by itself

has no binding effect on third parties; recordation does no
more than make

```



901



```

available for public inspection copies of in personam
transactions (contracts, deed, liens, etc.). Under recordation, however, ex
post litigation in the form

of a quiet title action may draw upon records of past
transactions to render judgments that have an in rem effect.

2 .In a sense, the registrar of deeds under the registration
system stands in for the public of in rem duty holders. The property rights are
given in

rem effect precisely because the registrar has put in the ex
ante effort to determine that such an effect is appropriate. Does this help
explain why,

according to an econometric study reported by Arruñada
elsewhere, a more definitive effect given to property rights by the
registration system correlates

with a smaller number of forms of property the system will
recognize (i.e., a stricter _numerus clausus_ of property rights)? Benito
Arruñada, Property

Enforcement as Organized Consent, 19 J. L. Econ & Org.
401 , 416 – 20 ( 2003 ). On one view, the _numerus clausus_ is enforced in
French law through the

formalities required for recording interests in order to get
in rem enforcement ex post. See Thomas W. Merrill & Henry E. Smith, Optimal

Standardization in the Law of Property: The _Numerus
Clausus_ Principle, 110 Yale L.J. 1 , 5 & n. 8 ( 2000 ). Something similar
may be true in Louisiana.

See Alejandro M. Garro, The Louisiana Public Records
Doctrine and the Civil Law Tradition 110 – 18 , 150 – 82 , 195 – 98 ( 1989 ).

3 .The registration system is thought to be more accurate
than the recording system, but also more expensive. Among other things, it
requires well-

trained and non-corrupt officials to administer it. Debate
about which system is better has raged for years. Compare Richard R. Powell,
Registration of

the Title to Land in the State of New York 69 ( 1938 )
(pro-recording); with Myres S. McDougal & John W. Brabner-Smith, Land Title
Transfer: A

Regression, 48 Yale L.J. 1125 ( 1939 ) (pro-registration).
See also Matthew Baker et al., Optimal Title Search, 31 J. Legal Stud. 139 (
2002 ) (the optimal

title search does not include the entire record, which
implies residual uncertainty). The Arruñada book excerpted above explores the
evidence on this

question as well as the incentives of the various actors
involved in a system of land records. Note that many countries setting up land
records for the first

time opt for registration, but advanced countries with
recordation face a somewhat different choice: whether the extra benefits of a
registration system

are worth the switching costs. See Joseph T. Janczyk, Land
Title Systems, Scale of Operations, and Operating and Conversion Costs, 8 J.
Legal Stud.

569 ( 1979 ). The benefits are likely to be less to the
extent that a title insurance industry has emerged to furnish additional
security of title to owners.

4 .Registration systems rely heavily on state officials and
uniform administrative procedures to certify title to land. Although gross
generalizations

are perilous, given the many variations among registration
systems, these features tend to make registration systems relatively
inflexible, both in terms

of how much effort officials put into any given title
inquiry and in terms of the speed with which those officials generate
registered deeds. Recording

systems, which rely mostly on competing private actors
(attorneys, title insurance companies) may be more flexible, in the sense that
the resources

devoted to title questions and the speed with which

```



902



```

title issues are resolved can be varied according to the
value of the property and the urgency of completing any given transaction. Does
this suggest that

recording acts may have certain efficiencies overlooked in
the traditional literature on tradeoffs between ex ante and ex post title
determination?

### 2 .AIRPLANES

Since the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, aviation law has
been almost entirely federal, and it requires the registration of civil
aircraft (which

in turn requires proof of ownership) and the recordation of
transfers of aircraft ownership as well as instruments affecting title such as
security

interests and leases. 49 U.S.C. § 44102(a) (2004); id. §
44107 (2004); 14 C.F.R. § 1 1; id. § 47.31(a) (2004). Until the conveyance or

encumbrance is recorded, it is good only against (1) the
transferor, and (2) third parties with actual notice. Id. § 44108(a). After
recordation, an

interest is good against “all persons.” Id. § 44108(b). In
Philko Aviation, Inc. v. Shacket , 462 U.S. 406, 409–1 1 (1983), the Supreme
Court

interpreted this provision as creating something like a
“race-notice” system (which we discuss further, infra), thereby preempting nemo
dat -style

state laws that would permit unrecorded transfers to be
valid against innocent third persons. Interestingly, while the statute speaks
of “actual

notice,” this has been taken to include “not only knowledge
that one’s seller lacks good title but also knowledge of facts that would lead
a

reasonable person to inquire further into the seller’s
title.” Shacket v. Philko Aviation, Inc., 841 F.2d 166, 170 (7th Cir. 1988)
(Posner, J.).

Suppose that on December 1, 2004, A sells Blackcraft (the
mythical prototypical airplane) to B, who then fails to file the bill of sale
with

the FAA. On January 15, 2005, A sells Blackcraft to C (who
doesn’t have notice of the earlier sale to B), who does file his bill of sale
with the

FAA. The holding in Philko Aviation implies that C, because
he recorded first and didn’t have notice, will own Blackcraft. C can rely on
the lack

of recordation at the time he bought Blackcraft, and the FAA
registry does indeed function as a recording system from C’s point of view.

### 3 .SHIPS

Starting with the Ship Mortgage Act of 1920, federal law has
provided for enforcement of mortgages on documented vessels of greater than

five tons. See 46 U.S.C. § 31301 et seq. (modified and
recodified in 1988). Conveyances of ships, including mortgages, are given full
in rem

effect against third parties only if they have been filed
with the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to 46 U.S.C. § 31321. Interests
which have

not been filed may still be enforced against the
grantor/mortgagor or his heir or devisee, or against “a person having actual
notice of the sale,

conveyance, mortgage, assignment or related instrument.” Id.
§ 31321 (a)(1)(C). Thus, the Ship Mortgage Act, like the FAA’s registration
system

for airplanes, operates in practice like a “race-notice”
recording act (again, see infra). The Ship Mortgage Act was designed to

#903

bring greater certainty to ship ownership, because many
liens on vessels are valid without filing or possession, leading one
commentator, quoting

a New Orleans attorney, to observe that “ ‘[l]iens on ships,
i.e. maritime liens, are often hidden and ships acquire liens like dogs get
fleas.’ ”

Matthew J. Bauer, Marine Title Insurance, 12 Conn. Ins. L.J.
17, 23 (2005); see also Grant Gilmore & Charles L. Black, Jr., The Law of

Admiralty 586–89 (2d ed. 1975). Because of these problems, a
maritime title insurance industry, roughly analogous to its land-based
counterpart,

has arisen. See Bauer, supra.

Smaller vessels are subject to state registration schemes
that operate much like automobile registration. See, e.g., Fla. Stat. Ann. §
328; Md.

Code, Nat. Res., § 8–7 01 et seq. State vessel registration
schemes vary in a fashion similar to those for auto registration. See 2
Benedict on

Admiralty § 68b (7th ed. 2006).

### 4 .AUTOMOBILES

In a way reminiscent of the federal regime for airplanes,
state law provides for registration and certification of title to automobiles.
Auto

registration is a system under which owners have to pay a
fee for the privilege of using the state’s highways. Certification of title
acts were

passed later, at first to prevent theft. But they developed
into a system for establishing the validity of ownership and security
interests. To obtain

a certificate of title, the owner submits an application
with information including a statement of the applicant’s title and each
security interest in

the automobile. When ownership is transferred, the owner
must endorse and deliver the certificate of title to the transferee, and the
transferee

must then apply at the Department of Motor Vehicles for a
new certificate of title within the prescribed time by presenting the endorsed

certificate of title from the transferor.

States vary in what effect they give to the certification
system. There are three varieties of statutes. First, “excepting” statutes
provide that,

when the statutory provisions on transfers of title aren’t
complied with, the transfer of title is invalid, except as between the two
parties to the

transaction. Second, “invalidating” statutes nullify a
noncompliant transfer of title even as between the two parties to the
transaction. Third,

“nondirective” statutes provide for some penalty for
noncompliance but do not affect the validity of the transfer of title. See
Pamela Trimble,

Rudiger Charolais Ranches v. Van De Graaf Ranches , and the
Impact of Other State Laws on the UCC Rights of a Good Faith Purchaser, 48

Consumer Fin. L.Q. Rep. 504, 507 (1994).

The last, nondirective type, is the easiest to integrate
with the Uniform Commercial Code: The UCC applies in full. Interestingly, even

excepting and invalidating statutes have been held to give
way to the UCC in allowing good faith purchasers in a noncomplying transaction
to

prevail. See, e.g., Island v. Warkenthien, 287 N.W.2d 487
(S.D. 1980); Heinrich v. Titus-Will Sales, 868 P.2d 169 (Wash. Ct. App. 1994).
The net

#904

effect is to make what sound like systems analogous to
Torrens-style (registration) systems for land into something like the recording
systems,

more equitable and oriented to the good faith purchaser. One
major problem with any attempt at a definitive automobile title record is that
cars

can easily be taken to other jurisdictions. And a potential
purchaser of an automobile has to worry that the vehicle is validly registered
in another

state.

Most states rely on state certificate of title acts for
purposes of recording security interests in automobiles under Article 9 of the
UCC (see

Chapter VII). The lien is recorded on a state certificate of
title, and potential transactors can ask the owner for a copy of the
certificate in order to

determine the status of the lien. The only potential problem
arises before an application for a certificate of title is filed, but no actual
case

involving this gap seems to have come up. For details, see
Lynn M. LoPucki & Elizabeth Warren, Secured Credit: A Systems Approach
423–38

(7th ed. 2012).

### 5 .ART

Another type of personal property that might be considered a
candidate for a registry is fine art. The ownership of art implicates two main

legal problems—theft and forgeries. Owners of well-known
works want to establish that they have the best rights in the work and that the
work

really is what it purports to be.

At present there is no central registry for title to art
works. Some owners feel nervous about publicizing their ownership—at least
before a

theft has occurred. Until recently there have only been
partial registries of stolen works.

To establish ownership of a work of art—and thereby avoid
the hazards of other claims and the possibility of fakery—one has to establish

the provenance of the work. Sources used include museum
catalogs and records of past exhibitions. Owners and transactors often rely on

catalogues raisonnés , which are usually compiled by an
acknowledged expert and contain information on every known piece by an
individual

artist, including a physical description and illustration of
the work, and its provenance and exhibition history. Other documentary evidence

(letters, memoirs, etc.) can also be used as evidence.

Researching a provenance is not only costly, but often far
less reliable than researching records in a central registry. A dramatic
illustration

of the problem is the famous recent forgery perpetrated by
two Britons, John Drewe ( né John Cockett) and John Myatt. Myatt forged over
200

paintings, many with acrylic paint and K-Y Jelly, and Drewe
sold the works, mostly though London auction houses. But unlike most forgeries

that rely on their resemblance to a master’s style, Drewe
forged the documents that would be used for the provenance of the works.

#905

After getting friends to sign letters attesting to their
ownership of the paintings and their authenticity, he then forged and altered

correspondence and catalogs in museum libraries. (The plot
was discovered only when Drewe’s girlfriend called the police.) Peter
Landesmann,

A 20th-Century Master Scam, N.Y. Times, July 18, 1999, at
SM32; Eamonn O’Neil, The Art of Deception, Scotsman, July 6, 2002, at 12.

Provenance is thus like recording in being based on a
history of transactions, but unlike recording, the evidence is not kept in a
systematic and

secure fashion. Recently, companies like Artory have begun
to provide a blockchain-based service that combines aspects of provenance and

chain or title in a more decentralized fashion. Because a
record is no better than its starting point, Artory will only register works
vetted by a

“record issuer.” Françoise Birnholz & Kelsey Barthold,
Back to the Future: Sorting Old Law from New Technology in Blockchain Smart

Contract Applications & Assessing the Need for
Regulation, 89 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. Arguendo 96, 1 12–14 (2021). In a
characteristically ironic

move, the non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that make such record
keeping possible are now being used in the art world to create unique digital

artworks with their own scarcity value.

### 6 .INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Intellectual property is a form of personal property. But
much of intellectual property law is federal law—unlike the law of personal

property generally. We consider here the registration
provisions for the major types of intellectual property: patent, trademark, and
copyright.

In the case of patents, part of one section of the Patent
Act deals with transfers and their effects against third parties:

An assignment, grant, or conveyance shall be void as against
any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration,

without notice, unless it is recorded in the Patent and
Trademark Office within three months from its date or prior to the date of such

subsequent purchase or mortgage.

35 U.S.C. § 261. This system is like a notice recording act
with a grace period. (For an explanation of the types of recording acts, see
infra Part

F.) Some have argued that “assignment, grant, or conveyance”
includes granting a security interest. See, e.g., Raymond T. Nimmer, Revised

Article 9 and Intellectual Property Asset Financing, 53 Me.
L. Rev. 287, 320–22, 335–37 (2001). The Ninth Circuit has held the opposite. In
re

Cybernetic Services, Inc., 252 F.3d 1039, 1052 (9th Cir.
2001).

Notice that the records kept by the patent office are like
registration in another respect: the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is
called

upon to evaluate the application for the patent, and those
questioning its validity can under some circumstances challenge a patent’s
validity at

the PTO. In the early nineteenth century, a system of
minimal examination prevailed, which relied more on the courts to sort out
which patents

were actually valid. Somewhat confusingly, this system of
minimal examination is called “registration” (as opposed to “examination”) in
the

patent context. Compare F. Scott Kieff, The Case for
Registering Patents and the Law and Economics of Patent-Obtaining Rules, 45
B.C. L. Rev.

55 (2003) (proposing “soft-look” registration) with Jay P.
Kesan, Carrots and Sticks to Create a Better Patent System, 17 Berkeley Tech.
L.J. 763,

775–76 (2002) (advocating tightened standard for granting
patents at the PTO for applicants who do not elect the “enhanced prior art
disclosure”

option). Historically, the United States was unique in
having a first-to-invent system, although this was recently changed in the
Leahy-Smith

America Invents Act of 201 1, adopting a first-to-file
system. This brings the U.S. into line with other countries and makes the
patent system

more like other registration regimes.

For federal trademarks, the Lanham Act sets up a similar
system for the “assignment” of trademarks:

An assignment shall be void against any subsequent purchaser
for valuable consideration without notice, unless the prescribed

information reporting the assignment is recorded in the
United States Patent and Trademark Office within 3 months after the date of

the assignment or prior to the subsequent purchase.

#907

15 U.S.C. § 1060(a)(4). Again, this is comparable to the
notice-plus-grace-period type of recording act. “Assignments” clearly include
transfers

of title but may not include security interests. For the
complex interaction between federal intellectual property registration and
(state law)

Article 9, see, e.g., Nimmer, supra.

Copyrights are subject to a much looser regime. The history
of copyright over the last century has been characterized by a move away from

formalities. Registration is not required to claim
copyright, but timely registration is advantageous for making statutory damages
available when

actual damages are hard to prove (and for being able to file
certain infringement actions, for evidentiary purposes, etc.). But failure to
register

does not invalidate a copyright. 17 U.S.C. § 409–412. To
comply with the Berne Convention, Congress eliminated the requirement of
registration

prior to suit for copyright owners from other Berne member
countries.

Some recent work has examined the emergence of extralegal
registries adjacent to intellectual property law in contexts where creators use

informal norms and rules to regulate use rather than formal
intellectual property protection. Skaters have established a registry for
roller derby

names, and a skater who steals a name that has been
registered might be ostracized in the derby community. David Fagundes, Talk
Derby to Me:

Emergent Intellectual Property Norms Governing Roller Derby
Pseudonyms, 90 Tex. L. Rev. 1093 (2012). Likewise, since 1946, an informal

“Clown Egg Register” has operated in England that permits
clowns to claim unique makeup designs by painting them on eggs. David Fagundes

& Aaron Perzanowski, Clown Eggs, 94 Notre Dame L. Rev.
1313 (2019). What does the emergence of these sorts of registries suggest about
the

functions, benefits, and costs of recording?

### 7 .CASH AND NEGOTIABILITY

As mentioned by Baird and Jackson, cash illustrates the good
faith purchaser rule at its widest. With cash there is no duty to inquire about

where it came from and whether the holder has good title.
This makes cash very liquid. A thief does not obtain title to stolen cash, but
one can

get good title to cash even from a thief. There is not only
no registry of cash, but even an original owner who could prove by using serial

numbers that certain cash was his cannot recover it from a
present good-faith holder.

Cash is sometimes said to be the extreme of “negotiability.”
A written instrument is “negotiable” when it is “capable of being transferred
by

delivery or indorsement when the transferee takes the
instrument for value, in good faith, and without notice of conflicting title
claims or

defenses.” Black’s Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009). Cashier’s
checks and bearer bonds would be examples. Negotiability is useful where the
issuer

is more able to bear the risk of loss or there is some
special value in avoiding inquiry on the part of transferees.

#908

Negotiability takes the good faith purchaser exception to
nemo dat the furthest. In U.S. law, an innocent holder can acquire good title
to

cash and negotiable instruments even with a thief in the
chain back to the original owner.

### F. RECORDING ACTS

As explored in the excerpt by Arruñada, land records can be
divided into recordation and registration. Nearly all localities in the United

States use recordation. The key attribute of recording is
that it generates, as a matter of law, constructive notice to all subsequent
purchasers in

the chain of title. Thus, recording acts create a powerful
incentive for purchasers to file their deeds (and mortgagees their mortgages,
etc.) in

order to block possible good faith purchaser claims by
subsequent transferees. Those interested in the state of title can examine the
records, or

more likely hire an expert to examine them (or a duplicate
set maintained privately by the title company) and produce an “abstract” or
report.

From time to time, various jurisdictions in the United
States have experimented with registration statutes, called Torrens Acts after
the Australian

law that inspired them. Most of these experiments failed,
and today Minneapolis-St. Paul is the only major area still covered by a
Torrens title

registration system. See Kimball Foster, Certificates of
Possessory Title: A Sensible Addition to Minnesota’s Successful Torrens System,
40

Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 112 (2013). As Arruñada recounts, most
of the rest of the world (including Germany, Great Britain, most of the other

commonwealth countries, and most developing countries) uses
registration.

The first recording acts were very simple and were what we
would now call the “race” type, under which the first of two property claimants

to record has the better claim. These acts in effect created
an exception to nemo dat much broader than the good faith purchaser rule,
allowing

any subsequent purchaser to prevail over the holder of a
prior unrecorded interest. (The race statute’s exception to nemo dat would be
unavailable

to anyone with respect to an interest that had been
previously recorded.) This led to great unfairness in certain circumstances, as
where someone

knowing of a prior transaction would “purchase” the land
from the grantor—who would have nothing to transfer under nemo dat —and then

would record first. The prior purchaser was out of luck. To
avoid this result, courts held that subsequent purchasers with notice of a
prior

conveyance would not get the protection of the statute.
Marshall v. Fisk, 6 Mass. (5 Tyng) 24, 30 (1809); Farnsworth v. Childs, 4 Mass.
(3 Tyng)

637, 639 (1808). Courts also developed robust doctrines of
constructive notice based on possession (especially open and notorious
possession),

M’Mechan v. Griffing, 20 Mass. (3 Pick.) 149, 154 (1825), or
even based on the publishing of the conveyance in the newspaper, Curtis v.

Mundy, 44 Mass. (3 Met.) 405, 408 (1841).

In response to these developments, legislatures, with
Massachusetts again in the lead, started to insert language in recording acts
requiring

good faith or lack of actual notice on the part of the
subsequent purchaser. See 14 Powell on Real Property § 82.02[1][c][iii]. These
“notice”

statutes fundamentally altered the nature of the recording
acts. Whereas a race statute in effect creates an exception to the good faith
purchaser

rule, a notice statute preserves the good faith purchaser
rule in full force, with the modification that recordation provides
constructive notice to

subsequent purchasers. In a third variation, the race-notice
statutes were adopted in the nineteenth century by several Middle Atlantic
states

(Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) in nearly
identical language. These acts combined the features of the race statutes and
the

notice statutes, requiring in effect that persons be both
good faith purchasers and be the first to record in order to prevail over other
claimants.

The Pennsylvania version spread to the Northwest Territory
with the result that many of the states of the Old Northwest (e.g., Indiana,
Ohio,

Michigan, and Wisconsin, but not Illinois) have race-notice
statutes.

Carol Rose has seen in the history of the recording acts a
story of legislatures adopting “crystalline” rules followed by judicial
decisions that

soften the rules with various equitable defenses and
qualifications, turning them into “mud.” Carol Rose, Crystals and Mud in
Property Law, 40

Stan. L. Rev. 577, 585– 90 (1988). (The portion of this
article dealing with mortgage foreclosures and redemptions is excerpted in
Chapter VII.)

The early history of recording acts certainly conforms to a
pattern of crystals followed by mud. But it is less clear that any cycling
between these

poles has continued. Perhaps because the notice and
race-notice statutes adopted in the nineteenth century have a built-in safety
valve to prevent

the worst abuses of the pure race statutes, courts were
nowhere as aggressive in their construction of notice and race-notice statutes
as they were

of race statutes. Later in the nineteenth century, courts
seem to have dropped the idea that possession by another (other than adverse
possession)

would itself cause subsequent purchasers to lose the
protection of the recording act. To be sure, courts did make exceptions for
situations of

direct misrepresentation by the first purchaser to the
second purchaser. See Marling v. Milwaukee Realty Co., 106 N.W. 844 (Wis.
1906); Guffey

v. O’Reiley, 88 Mo. 418 (1885). As with many equitable
interventions (and inventions), the protection of the good faith purchaser has
morphed

from a more contextual analysis to something more rule-like.
See Henry E. Smith, Equity as Meta-Law, 130 Yale L.J. 105, 1094–98, 1 108–10

(2021). Overall, however, it may be that we have achieved
something of a stable equilibrium with respect to the understanding and
application of

recording acts today. (Which is not to say that application
of the statutes is easy!)

#910

Before we turn in more detail to the various types of
recording acts, it is important to know how a title search does—and sometimes
does

not—work.

Title Search and “Chain of Title”

Recording acts require that public officials, such as the
county clerk or recorder of deeds, maintain an office in which deeds and other

documents affecting title may be recorded. Typically there
will be a recorder’s office in every county in a state. The employees who run
these

offices do little if any screening of the documents
submitted for recordation. Thus, not only deeds and mortgages, but also
judicial judgments,

letters, and memoranda may be recorded. Every recording
office has at least two indexes: a grantee index and a grantor index. As their
names

suggest, the grantee index includes, by name, all grantees
referenced in the documents that have been submitted for recordation; the
grantor

index includes, by name, all grantors referenced in the
documents that have been submitted for recordation. Grantors and grantees are
arranged

alphabetically, although there may be a separate index for
each year. Some recorders’ offices—but not all—also keep something called a
tract

index, in which all documents submitted for recordation are
listed by the legal description of the property under the surveying system
established

by the Land Ordinance of 1785 (or an equivalent parcel
indexing system developed for a metes and bounds state). This is extremely
useful, either

as a shortcut to doing a title search or as a check against
the search results produced using the grantor and grantee indexes.

In jurisdictions where the search mechanism is an index by
grantor and grantee, performing a title search involves tracing the series of

transactions from one’s would-be transferor back to a “root
of title” and then tracing forward. First one looks in the grantee index for
one’s

transferor to find the deed by which he took from his
predecessor, the deed from the predecessor’s predecessor, and so on. This
ensures that the

would-be transferor obtained his title through a chain of
legitimate transfers. In many states, marketable title acts (see below) allow
the search to

stop at some date in the past—say 30 or 40 years ago—rather
than needing to trace all the way to the sovereign or some other “root.”
Second,

once one has gone back far enough, one repeats the process
going forward in time through the grantor index. Tracing forward involves

investigating what each of the people discovered in the
grantee index did with the title in the relevant period. One might think that
this period is

the time between execution of the deed to the grantor and
the date of execution of the deed from the grantor to the next link in the
chain, but this

would be inadequate. Instead, for each of the people in the
chain, one must look in the grantor index between (i) the date of execution of
the deed

to that person and (ii) the date that the deed from that
person to the next person was recorded. One is responsible for knowing what
each

#911

person might have granted from the time of execution of the
deed to that person but before it is recorded, and one has to check for
possible

transactions after that person executed a deed to another
but before that deed was recorded. Anything outside the period bounded by (i)
and (ii)—

the period before the execution of the deed to X and after
the recording of the deed from X—is said to be outside the “chain of title” and
as to

such matters the land records do not furnish constructive
notice. Consequently, if something is outside the chain of title (outside the
legally

defined reasonable search), the good faith purchaser
exception to nemo dat applies.

The chain of title concept is a compromise between a more
thorough but more expensive search and a less thorough but more manageable

search. The mechanics are best appreciated though an
example.

Example. On April 15, 2021 you are considering a purchase
from D of a parcel known as Blackacre, located in the town of Springfield. You

must perform a title search to ascertain the state of the
title. Here is a sketch, assuming that the state only requires a title search
going back 40

years. More might be required in other jurisdictions.

Running backwards in the Grantee Index :

1.Look up D in the Grantee Index and find his grantor, C.
The index refers to a deed from C to D on April 1, 2010, recorded that day.

2.Search C backwards from April 1, 2010 until you find a
reference to a deed from B, dated October 1, 2001 and recorded on April 15,
2006.

3.Search under B backwards from October 1, 2001 and find a
deed from A on January 30, 1983 and recorded that day.

4.Search A backwards to 1981. A owned Blackacre on January
1, 1966.

Running forward in the Grantor Index :

1.Search A forward in the Grantor Index from January 1, 1981
to January 30, 1983 (deed to B).

2.Search B forward from January 30, 1983 until April 15,
2006 (recordation of deed to C).

3.Search C forward from October 1, 2001 (date of deed to C)
until April 1, 2010 (deed to D).

4.Search D forward from April 1, 2010 until the present.

Chain of Title (from the minimal search):

January 1, 1981—January 30, 1983: A owns and then conveys to
B.

January 30, 1983—October 1, 2001: B owns and then conveys to
C, but the deed is not recorded until April 15, 2006.

October 1, 2001—April 1, 2010: C owns and then conveys to D.

April 1, 2010—April 15, 2021: D owns.

#912

In a recording system, the official keeping the records has
a duty to accept and file records of the proper form, but has no duty to
investigate the

state of title. In this example, we assumed that all the
recorded deeds were legitimate. This is not always so.

Types of Recording Acts

Today in the United States, there are three types of
recording acts:

1.Race. Under a race statute, as between successive grantees
of interests in real property, the first to record prevails. This was the
original type

of statute, but now at most two states have a simple race
statute. So if O sells to A and then sells to B, but B records before A, then B
has title; A

has only a claim against O. Race statutes create an
exception to the nemo dat principle and a partial exception to the good faith
purchaser

doctrine, insofar as the first party to record wins even if
she has actual notice of a prior conveyance. An example of a race statute:

(a)No (i) conveyance of land, or (ii) contract to convey, or
(iii) option to convey, or (iv) lease of land for more than three years shall

be valid to pass any property interest as against lien
creditors or purchasers for a valuable consideration from the donor, bargainor
or

lessor but from the time of registration thereof in the
county where the land lies * * *

N.C. Stat. § 47–18. See Rowe v. Walker, 441 S.E.2d 156 (N.C.
Ct. App. 1994), aff’d, 455 S.E.2d 160 (N.C. 1995).

2.Notice. Under a notice statute, as between successive
grantees of an interest in real property, a subsequent purchaser for value
prevails over a

prior grantee only if the subsequent purchaser lacked notice
of the earlier conveyance. Jurisdictions have used varied terms to
differentiate

among forms of notice. See, e.g., Blevins v. Johnson Cty.,
746 S.W.2d 678, 683 (Tenn. 198 8) (noting that state’s courts consider “inquiry
notice”

a species of “actual notice” and citing others that treat it
as a species of “constructive notice”). In general, notice may be actual or
constructive. A

person has actual notice of an adverse interest if that
person has actual knowledge of it, while that person has constructive notice of
an adverse

interest if: (1) the person has implied notice of the
interest, because the person has acquired knowledge of particular facts related
to the interest in

question that would provoke a person of common sense and
prudence to make reasonable inquiries which would have led to the discovery of
the

adverse interest; or (b) the person has inquiry notice of
the interest, because a person conducting standard due diligence with common
sense and

prudence would have discovered the adverse interest; or (c)
the person has record notice of the interest, because a document evidencing an

adverse interest is recorded in the chain of title to the
property. Again, jurisdictions may vary in particulars as to how they describe
these forms of

notice or whether they recognize certain forms of notice at
all. See Restatement (Fourth) of Property, Vol. 5, Div. IV, Ch. 3, §§ 3.1–3.2
(Am.

#913

L. Inst. Council Draft No. 4, Sept. 24, 2021); In re
Daylight Dairy Prod., Inc., 125 B.R. 1, 3 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1991)
(“Massachusetts law does

not recognize inquiry notice of unrecorded deeds or
mortgages.”).

Because recording imparts constructive notice of an interest
to all others, note the incentive to record immediately in order to be
protected

from subsequent good faith purchasers. An example of a
notice statute:

A conveyance of an estate in fee simple, fee tail or for
life, or a lease for more than seven years from the making thereof, * * * shall

not be valid as against any person, except the grantor or
lessor, his heirs and devisees and persons having actual notice of it, unless
it

* * * is recorded in the registry of deeds for the county or
      district in which the land to which it relates lies.

Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. Ch. 183, § 4.

3.Race-Notice. Under a race-notice statute, as between
successive grantees of an interest in real property, a subsequent purchaser for
value

prevails over a prior grantee only if: (1) the subsequent
purchaser lacked notice of the earlier interest; and (2) the subsequent
purchaser records

first. This is like the race statute but solves the problem
of the unscrupulous subsequent buyer under the race approach. An example of a
race-

notice statute:

Every conveyance of real property or an estate for years
therein, other than a lease for a term not exceeding one year, is void as
against

any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee of the same property,
or any part thereof, in good faith and for a valuable consideration, whose

conveyance is first duly recorded * * *

Cal. Civ. Code § 1214.

4.Mixed regimes. Some states apply a race regime to
mortgages but another type of recording act to conveyances in general. Compare
the

following two Arkansas statutes:

Every mortgage of real estate shall be a lien on the
mortgaged property from the time it is filed in the recorder’s office for
record, and

not before. The filing shall be notice to all persons of the
existence of the mortgage.

Ark. Code Ann. § 18–40–102.

(a)Every deed, bond, or instrument of writing affecting the
title, in law or equity, to any real or personal property, within this state

which is, or may be, required by law to be acknowledged or
proved and recorded shall be constructive notice to all persons from the

time the instrument is filed for record in the office of the
recorder of the proper county.

(b)No deed, bond, or instrument of writing for the
conveyance of any real estate, or by which the title thereto may be affected in
law

or equity, made or executed after December 21, 1846, shall
be good or valid against a subsequent purchaser of the real

#914

estate for a valuable consideration without actual notice
thereof or against any creditor of the person executing such an instrument

obtaining a judgment or decree which by law may be a lien
upon the real estate unless the deed, bond, or instrument, duly executed

and acknowledged or proved as required by law, is filed for
record in the office of the clerk and ex officio recorder of the county where

the real estate is situated.

Ark. Code Ann. § 14–15–404. See also Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 21,
§ 351 (race-notice statute for conveyances other than mortgages); id. § 622
(race

statute for mortgages).

Some states allow a “grace period” for filing such that the
bona fide purchaser prevails over the prior grantee only if the prior grantee
fails

to record within the grace period. See, e.g., Del. Code Ann.
tit. 25, § 153 (providing for 15-day grace period).

The Shelter Rule

Finally, courts have interpreted recording acts to create an
exception for certain transferees who otherwise would be barred from obtaining

title because they are not good faith purchasers for value.
Suppose O conveys to A, who does not record. Then O conveys to B who gives
value

and has no notice of the prior conveyance to A. B then
records. Under a race, notice, or race-notice recording act, B should prevail
over A. But

what happens if B then gifts the land to C (so C is not a
bona fide purchaser for value under the recording act), or B sells to C, even
though C

was aware of the prior deed to A? A literal reading of the
statutes might lead one to think that C should lose to A under these
circumstances,

since C is not a good faith purchaser. But under what has
been called the Shelter Rule, courts have held that C prevails against A. See,
e.g., Jones

v. Independent Title Co., 147 P.2d 542, 543 (Cal. 1944).
Once B prevails against A, they have reasoned, B should be given all the
attributes of

ownership, including the right to make normal nemo-dat style
transfers of the property. If the rule were otherwise, then B would have less
than

full ownership, because he could not give away the property
or sell it to those with notice of the transfer to A.

The Shelter Rule has limits of its own: If B in our
hypothetical seeks to transfer the property back to O, the original owner, the
Shelter Rule

does not apply; under the “original owner exception” to the
Shelter Rule, O cannot shelter under B’s rights. See, e.g., Chergosky v.
Crosstown

Bell, Inc., 463 N.W.2d 522 (Minn. 1990). It is generally
thought that the opportunities for collusion in such an arrangement are too
great, and

precluding B from conveying B’s full rights to O does not
significantly curtail B’s market.

#915

Recording Doctrines Based on Chain of Title

The recording acts in conjunction with the notion of chain
of title define a legally required search for one who wishes to take advantage
of

the protection afforded good faith purchasers under the act.
If a deed or encumbrance would be revealed by the legally required
search—putting

it within the chain of title—then it affords constructive
notice. But if the deed or encumbrance is outside that search (not in the chain
of title), it

does not afford constructive notice to a subsequent
purchaser for value and so its holder loses out to the GFPV. As we will see,
things are not so

tidy in light of off-record matters that can affect the
title of even a GFPV, but even the notion of chain of title and legally
reasonable search can

be difficult to define around the edges. Consider some
perennial problems that arise when the only search mechanism is an index by
grantor and

grantee. (Note that these problems may be less likely to
arise where there is a tract index or searchable electronic land records.)

The “Wild Deed.” A wild deed is one deemed outside the chain
of title because a prior conveyance in the chain was not recorded. A wild

deed can arise (1) when a purported grantor records the
transfer of an interest that the grantor does not in fact have or (2) when a
grantee records

before her grantor, as the following example illustrates.
Say O grants to A, who does not record. O then grants to B, who does not
record. What if

then B conveys to C, and then C, A, and B record in that
order? Who would win in a notice or race-notice jurisdiction, A or C? C’s is a
wild deed

because it is not connected up to the common grantor by a
continuous chain of recording, and C is sometimes said to be a “stranger to the
title.”

Searchers of traditional records will not find the wild deed
in a conventional chain of title search, because the name of the grantee, here
B, would

be unknown to searchers. Moreover, in the period between A’s
recording and B’s recording, a purchaser from A would have no way of finding

C’s deed. See Board of Education of Minneapolis v. Hughes,
136 N.W., 1095 (Minn. 1912). The majority of courts agree that one cannot
benefit

from the recording act’s exception to nemo dat if one traces
one’s ownership to a wild deed. For recent examples, see Salt Lake County v.
Metro

West Ready Mix, Inc., 89 P.3d 155 (Utah 2004); Holland v.
Hattaway, 438 So.2d 456, 470 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1983); see also Zimmer v.
Sundell,

296 N.W. 589 (Wis. 1941). Some courts simply deny that the
holder of a wild deed is a good faith purchaser, on the rationale that someone
in C’s

position has constructive notice and could relatively easily
make sure that her grantor’s (B’s) deed is recorded before she records (or
purchases,

for that matter).

Late (and Early) Recorded Deeds. Problems can arise if
someone records so late that another branch of title gets started in the
meantime.

Consider this scenario: O sells to A and then to B, who has
actual notice of the O-to-A sale. B then records and then A records. Then B
sells to C,

who has no actual notice of the O-to-A sale. C then records.
First, C cannot take advantage of the shelter rule. (Do you see why?) Under the

#916

majority approach to this question, the chain of title
concept makes C the winner. When doing a search forward, C is supposed to
search O as a

grantor from the time O acquired the interest until the time
that B recorded. At that latter point A has not recorded yet, but it would be

burdensome for C to have to search O as grantor all the way
down to the present. See Morse v. Curtis, 2 N.E. 929 (Mass. 1885); see also

Restatement (Fourth) of Property, Vol. 5, Div. IV, Ch. 4, §
4.4 (Am. L. Inst. Council Draft No. 4, Sept. 24, 2021). Yet some courts do go
beyond

the classic chain of title and require searches from each
grantor in one’s chain of title down to the present, which would pick up A’s
deed in our

example. In such jurisdictions, C would have constructive
notice of A’s deed, and A would prevail over C. See Woods v. Garnett, 16 So.
390, 392

(Miss. 1894).

Similarly, if someone conveys land before acquiring it, the
earlier conveyance is outside the chain of title of a later purchaser and so
would

not, even if recorded, furnish constructive notice. Thus, if
O conveys Blackacre to A, then acquires Blackacre and records, and conveys it
to B, A

might invoke estoppel by deed. Nevertheless, most courts
would hold that there being no reasonable way for B to know of A, B prevails
over A.

See, e.g., Sabo v. Horvath, 559 P.2d 1038, 1044 (Alaska
1976); Wheeler v. Young, 55 A. 670 (Conn. 1903); see also Restatement (Fourth)
of

Property, Vol. 5, Div. IV, Ch. 4, § 4.3 (Am. L. Inst.
Council Draft No. 4, Sept. 24, 2021). But, as with the late recorded deed, some
courts do hold

that a deed like A’s if recorded furnishes constructive
notice to B, thereby holding B to a more stringent search. See 11 Thompson on
Real

Property § 92.09(c)(2)(B)(i), at 185–86 (David A. Thomas
ed., 3d ed. 2015).

“Mother Hubbard” Clauses. Sometimes deeds will use a general
description of a collection of lands without specifically enumerating

them. For example, a deed might convey “ ‘all interest of
whatsoever nature in all working interests and overriding royalty interest in
all Oil and

Gas Leases in Coffey County, Kansas, owned by them whether
or not the same are specifically enumerated above.. .’ ” Luthi v. Evans, 576
P.2d

1064, 1067 (Kan. 1978). Such a deed is valid as between the
parties, but such a deed does not impart constructive notice to subsequent

purchasers. Such a description does not permit the deed to
be indexed properly in a tract index, and even a subsequent purchaser who finds
such

a deed would have a lot of investigating to do to figure out
which parcels the deed covered and what happened to them. Generally “Mother

Hubbard” clauses do not on their own furnish constructive
notice to subsequent purchasers. A grantee of a deed with such a clause should
file in

the land records an affidavit with a specific description of
the lands conveyed or covered.

Restrictions on Adjacent Tracts. In a somewhat similar
fashion, an owner may convey parcels while restricting retained land. This is

particularly common in subdivisions. What if the developer
sells Lot 1 with a reciprocal covenant that Lot 1 and adjacent Lot 2 (and
perhaps

#917

other lots in the area) will be used for residential
purposes only? The developer then sells Lot 2 without any such restriction.
Some courts hew

closely to the chain of title and emphasize the burden on
the subsequent purchaser and hold that a purchaser of Lot 2 without actual
notice is not

bound. See, e.g., Spring Lakes v. O.F.M. Co., 467 N.E.2d 537
(Ohio 1984); Buffalo Academy of the Sacred Heart v. Boehm Bros., Inc., 196 N.E.

42 (N.Y. 1935). Other courts require searchers to look at
the deeds for adjacent parcels and find constructive notice, especially if the
parcels are

part of the same subdivision. See Guillette v. Daly Dry
Wall, 325 N.E.2d 572, 574 (Mass. 1975) (purchaser is required to look through
other

conveyances in the same subdivision by the same grantor);
Finley v. Glenn, 154 A. 299, 301 (Pa. 1931) (purchaser is responsible for
restrictions

contained in conveyances from his grantor that affect the
purchased parcel); see also Restatement (Fourth) of Property, Vol. 5, Div. IV,
Ch. 3,

§ 3.2 cmt. f (Am. L. Inst. Council Draft No. 4, Sept. 24,
2021) (“[A] subsequent purchaser is charged with inquiry notice of claims or

encumbrances that would be discovered by a purchaser
engaging in standard due diligence, i.e., those restrictions that would be
apparent based

on a reasonable examination of the property. When a party
argues that a purchaser is on inquiry notice by virtue of a common plan, an
evaluation

of the circumstances should take into account the degree of
uniformity of appearance or type of use, as well as the presence or absence of
other

facts (such as the existence of a homeowner’s association
for enforcement) suggesting the property may be encumbered.”). See also Sanborn
v.

McLean on the “common plan doctrine” in Chapter IX. Also in
that chapter we will see how easements can arise in ways other than by grant.

Such easements (by implication, necessity, estoppel)
constitute yet another source of off-record risks for the prospective
purchaser.

Improper Indexing. Sometimes instruments will be improperly
recorded. Somewhat surprisingly, a majority of courts have held that

indexing is not part of recordation and so not essential to
the giving of constructive notice. A minority of courts have held that a
failure to index,

or sometimes incorrect indexing, can prevent the giving of
constructive notice. As one Iowa court put it, without a means to locate it, a
single

deed in the voluminous land records “might as well be buried
in the earth as in a mass of records without a clue to its whereabouts, or...
the

instrument might as well be written on a slate or copied
into the Recorder’s family Bible.” Barney v. McCarty, 15 Iowa 510, 521 (1864);
see also

Restatement (Fourth) of Property, Vol. 5, Div. IV, Ch. 4, §
4.2 (Am. L. Inst. Council Draft No. 4, Sept. 24, 2021) (adopting minority
approach).

Variants of the same name may lead to difficulties in
constructing a chain of title. As between the recorder of an improperly indexed
interest and

a later searcher, who can more easily deal with the problem?

All errors are not created equal. Traditionally, a
reasonable searcher must search for very close variants of a name, especially
if they sound

#918

alike and the differences are small, but not distant ones,
especially if they begin with a different letter (“Cheffey” versus “Sheffey”).
Similarly,

errors in descriptions can deprive a deed of the
constructive notice-giving effect, depending on how confusing they are. (The
Mother Hubbard

clause presents a related problem.)

PROBLEMS

In the following conveyances for value, what is the result
under each type of statute? [Hint: In working though the problems, begin with
the last

conveyance, chronologically speaking, and then work back
toward conveyances earlier in time. Once you find a party that prevails under
the recording

act, that party will generally prevail against all earlier
claimants.]

```



1 .O conveys to A. O then conveys to B, who is unaware of
the conveyance to A. B records immediately. Then A records.



2 .O conveys to A. O then conveys to B, who is aware of the
conveyance to A. B records immediately. Then A records.



```

3 .O conveys to A, who does not record. Then O conveys to B,
who also does not record. Then O conveys to C, who does not record. First
assume

that B and C are each unaware of the previous grants from O.
Then consider: What if each of them _is_ aware?

4 .O conveys to A. O then conveys to B, who has no knowledge
of A’s deed. Then A records. B then records and sells to C.

5 .O conveys to A. O then conveys to B, who has no knowledge
of A’s deed. Then A records. B then records and sells to O. (This is the same

situation as in Problem 4 , except C is replaced by O).

6 .O conveys to A. O then conveys to B who has actual notice
of the deed from O to A. B records, and then A records. Then B sells to C.

7 .O conveys to A before O has any title. A immediately
records. O then acquires title from X and records. O then conveys to B.

8 .O conveys to A. O then conveys to B, who does not record.
B conveys to C who records immediately. A conveys to D. Then A and D both

record, and finally B records.

9 .O owns adjacent parcels and sells parcel 1 to A and
includes in the deed a covenant to restrict parcel 2 to residential use. Then O
sells parcel 2 to

B without mentioning the restriction, but mentions a
subdivision plan in the deed. Is B bound by the covenant?

10 .O conveys a fee simple to A, who does not record. O then
enters into a land sale contract with B, which obligates B to pay to O a down

payment and make a series of payments; after the last
payment is made, O will convey a deed to B in fee simple. B records the
contract but finds out

about the prior O-to-A deed before making the final payment.
Assume O is judgment-proof.

At this point the attentive reader may be wondering whether
there can be circular priorities. The answer is yes, especially in situations
of mortgages

and other liens, which present a classic brain-teaser.
Consider the situation where O owns Blackacre and mortgages it to A for $ 30 ,
000. A does not

record

the mortgage. O then mortgages Blackacre to B for $ 4000. B
records but has notice of A’s mortgage. O then mortgages to C for $ 5000 , and
C records.

The fund for distribution (say from a foreclosure) is
insufficient to satisfy all three liens. For a variety of solutions and

Electronic Land Records

Land records are increasingly computerized and even
available on the Internet. The first step in migrating to electronic
recordation is to

scan paper title documents and organize them into a simple
database, akin to a spreadsheet, with possibly the addition of a parcel
identifier

number. Statutes are needed in order to give electronic
filing, online notice, and electronic searches legal effect, and legislatures
are beginning to

do so, with a majority having passed the Uniform Real
Property Electronic Recording Act (URPERA). Further legal implications from

computerization of land records may be on the horizon. As
long as records can be searched electronically by grantor and grantee, the type
of

search that is cost-effective increases, which can be
expected to create pressure to expand the notions of “chain of title” and
constructive notice.

Recall that chain of title is based on the limited search,
described earlier, that is reasonable to expect a prospective purchaser to
engage in.

Electronic records can be expected to have an even greater
impact if they allow search by tract or property location rather just by
grantor and

grantee. The most advanced systems are beginning to use
geographic information systems (GIS) that integrate a variety of information on
an

interactive map. The demand for electronic record keeping is
reflected in the adoption by mortgage industry participants of the Mortgage

Electronic Registrations Systems, Inc. (MERS), which is
unlike the public records in not being transparent (a feature which has made it
the

subject of ongoing litigation, see Chapter VII). On the
other hand, online land records raise issues about privacy, including the
handling of

personal information. See, e.g., Ostergren v. Cuccinelli,
615 F.3d 263, 267–68 (4th Cir. 2010) (imperfect redaction of social security
numbers

from recorded documents); see also Reid K. Weisbord &
Stewart Sterk, The Commodification of Public Land Records, 97 Notre Dame L.
Rev.

(forthcoming).

The legal status of electronic records is still being
established but their principal advantage stems from their searchability.
Consider again

the concepts of constructive notice and chain of title in
the light of electronic search of land records. The wild deed, the late (and
early) recorded

deed, the restriction on adjacent land, and misindexing are
all easier for subsequent searchers to deal with in an electronic search,
especially if

search by tract is possible. Nonetheless, decisions will
have

#920

to be made, most probably in passing statutes, to redraw the
boundaries of the new broader notion of chain of title in some cases. Would a

subsequent searcher be able to prove that, after a diligent
search, she was still unable to find the earlier deed? Cases have yet to
establish the

required parameters of electronic search. Although overruled
on other grounds, one court has endorsed an overall “diligent search” or

reasonableness approach in evaluating the steps searchers
should have taken and the documents searchers should have located. First
Citizens Nat.

Bank v. Sherwood, 817 A.2d 501, 505 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2003),
rev’d on other grounds, 879 A.2d 178 (Pa. 2005). For a thorough discussion of
these

issues, see Emily Bayer-Pacht, The Computerization of Land
Records: How Advances in Recording Systems Affect the Rationale Behind Some

Existing Chain of Title Doctrines, 32 Cardozo L. Rev. 337
(2010); see also Dale A. Whitman, Are We There Yet? The Case for a Uniform

Electronic Recording Act, 24 W. New Eng. L. Rev. 245 (2002);
Tanya D. Marsh, Foreclosures and the Failure of the American Land Title

Recording System, 1 1 1 Colum. L. Rev. Sidebar 19 (2011).

Even more speculative are the first stirrings of the use of
blockchain to supplement land records and to reduce fraud. Blockchain uses a

distributed digital leger protected by practically
unreversible cryptographic functions to authenticate structured records
(“blocks”). Pilot projects

in Vermont and Cook County have been undertaken. For the
promises and limits of this technology in the area of property transactions,
see, e.g.,

Benito Arruñada, Blockchain’s Struggle to Deliver Impersonal
Exchange, 19 Minn. J.L. Sci. & Tech. 55 (2018); Matt Koronczak, The New

“Chain” of Title: How Blockchain Will Affect Land Title
Research, Recordation, and Insurance 5 Tex A&M J. Prop. L. 401 (2019). How
might

this lowering of information costs affect the duty to
search? Would you expect the availability of online records to lead to a
tightening or

loosening of the numerus clausus and related restrictions on
property forms?

Ease of search improves the usability of a recording system:
Electronic search makes the recording system better as a recording system and

indirectly makes rights more secure. In general, those
defects of the recording system stemming from practical limitations—the lack of
a tract

index, the difficulty of searching under multiple spellings,
and the like—are amenable to a technological solution.

Still, electronic land records do nothing directly to cut
off inconsistent rights, as a registration system does. Recall that the main
difference

between recordation and registration is that in the latter
an official (the registrar of deeds) will not only receive the transactional
documents but

will examine them and purge invalid or nonconforming
interests, with the result of a clean and indefeasible title. In a registration
system there are

two sets of records, the lodgment or presentation diary (the
set of incoming and as yet unexamined documents with the time of filing for
priority

purposes) and the definitive

#921

titles themselves (the result of the examination and purge).
The presentation diary is easiest to automate, along the lines discussed
earlier. In a

registration system there is the further question of how far
to try to automate the process of creating definitive title. Generally, this
part of the

process is still handled by humans. New Zealand is
attempting to automate all of its Torrens system. Automating registration is
likely to require

even more standardization of legal interests in land, and,
interestingly, New Zealand with its extreme automation of its Torrens
registration

system has made an effort to further standardize land
transaction documents, see https://www.linz.govt.nz/ land/ land-registration/
prepare-and-

submit-your-dealing. (A recent article assessing the
prospects of digitizing the Torrens Registration System used in Australia and
New Zealand

argues that this would make property less secure, by
increasing the opportunities for fraud. Rod Thomas, Australasian Torrens
Automation, Its

Integrity, and the Three Proof Requirements, 2012 NZ Law
Review 227 (2013).) If electronic registration causes delay, confusion, or
increased

incidents of fraud in the process of producing definitive
title (the move from the presentation diary to clean title), a registration
system can

become in effect a recordation system (as it in effect is
between presenting transaction documents and the issuance of clean title). For
a

discussion of the many issues raised by electronic
registration, see Benito Arruñada, Leaky Title Syndrome?, New Zealand L.J. 115
(April 2010).

How does the prospect of online land records affect the
choice between registration and recordation?

#### ———

Given that most modern recording acts are modifications of
the good faith purchaser rule, elements of that rule continue to play an

important role in the implementation of the recording acts.
One important and recurring requirement that is drawn from good faith purchaser

doctrine is that the recording acts only protect persons who
are good faith purchasers “for value.” Consider the following case.

#### Hood v. Webster

```



Court of Appeals of New York, 1936.



2 N.E. 2 d 43.



```

■
LOUGHRAN, JUDGE. Florence F. Hood owned a parcel of farm land in the town of
Phelps, Ontario county. This property had been devised to her

by her husband, whose will said that, should she predecease
him, he wanted his estate to go to his brother, the plaintiff here. In 1913
Mrs. Hood

executed a deed of the farm to the plaintiff and delivered
it to his attorney as an escrow to take effect on her death. The Appellate
Division has

confirmed a finding of the Equity Term that this delivery
was subject to no other condition. A majority of this court has come to the
conclusion

#922

that the contrary of the fact so found may not be declared
as matter of law on this record.

Having all along occupied the property, Mrs. Hood in 1928
granted it to the defendants (her brother and a nephew) by a deed then
recorded.

She died in 1933. The prior deed held as an escrow was
thereupon delivered over to the plaintiff who had it recorded. In this action
to annul the

subsequent deed to the defendants, it has been held that on
the foregoing facts the plaintiff was entitled to prevail.

On this appeal by the defendants, the parties concede that
the case made by the findings depends for its solution upon the force and
effect of

section 291 of the Real Property Law (Consol.Laws, c. 50).
It is thereby provided that every conveyance of real property not recorded “is
void as

against any subsequent purchaser in good faith and for a
valuable consideration, from the same vendor, his heirs or devisees, of the
same real

property or any portion thereof, whose conveyance is first
duly recorded.”

Did the single circumstance that the subsequent deed to the
defendants was first on record establish, in the absence of evidence to the

contrary, the matters thus essential to avoid the prior deed
to the plaintiff?

We think this question of burden of proof as fixed by the
recording act is not for us an open one. The defendants were bound to make out
by

a fair preponderance of evidence the affirmative assertion
of their status as purchasers in good faith and for a valuable consideration.

Brown v. Volkening, 64 N.Y. 76 (1876), and Constant v.
University of Rochester, 19 N.E. 631 (N.Y. (1899)), Id., 31 N.E. 26, as read by
us,

are not authorities to the contrary. In those cases the
court did say that the party who claimed under an unrecorded conveyance was
required to

prove that the subsequent record purchaser took with notice.
But here, as elsewhere, it must be kept in mind that the phrase “burden of
proof”

may stand in one connection “for the never changing burden
of establishing the proposition in issue,” and in another “for the constantly
changing

burden of producing evidence.” Thayer, Preliminary Treatise
on Evidence, 353–389. In the Brown and Constant Cases the controlling factor
was

that substantial value had been paid for the subsequent
conveyance. That fact was more than evidence of consideration. It was further
the basis

for the auxiliary inference that there was also good faith
in the transaction, and what was said respecting the burden of proof had
reference to the

duty of adducing evidence to repel that inference. For the
same reason, the burden of proof (in the same sense) is upon the holder of an

unrecorded conveyance when a subsequent deed first recorded
acknowledges receipt by the grantor of a consideration sufficient to satisfy
the

statute.

We have a different case here. Under their defense of
purchase for value without notice the defendants offered no evidence of actual

#923

considerations given. The subsequent deed to them expressed
their payment of “One Dollar and other good and valuable consideration.” This

recital was not enough to put them into the position of
purchasers for a valuable consideration in the sense of the statute. Ten Eyck
v. Whitbeck,

31 N.E. 994 (N.Y. 1892); Lehrenkrauss v. Bonnell, 92 N.E.
637 (N.Y. 1910).

The duty of maintaining the affirmative of the issue, and in
a primary sense the burden of proof, was cast upon the defendants by the

recording act. They failed to discharge that burden.

The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.

■ CRANE,
CHIEF JUDGE (dissenting). I cannot agree with Brother LOUGHRAN’S view of the
law nor with his conclusion on the evidence in this

case. * * *

It is conceded that the holder of a prior unrecorded deed
has the burden of proving the lack of good faith in the holder of a subsequent

recorded deed. The burden is upon him to prove notice or
such circumstances as would give notice to a reasonable man. I can see no
reason for

complicating this rule by shifting the burden of proof when
it comes to valuable consideration. It is just as easy to prove lack of
consideration in

this day when parties may be witnesses and examined before
trial as it is to prove notice or bad faith. We should not impair the force and
efficacy

of the recording statutes upon which it has become a habit
and custom to rely in the transfer of real property. A deed or mortgage on
record is

good as against prior unrecorded deeds or incumbrances until
notice or bad faith or a lack of consideration is proven. The burden of proof
should

rest with the person who asserts the invalidity. * * *

Naturally this burden of proof readily shifts and where
fraud is shown or circumstances which cast suspicion upon the transactions the

defendant—subsequent vendee—may be called upon to show or
prove his good faith and the consideration. * * *

I go still further, however, and hold that the plaintiff is
not entitled to recover on the evidence. Florence F. Hood was a widow of about
fifty-

five years of age, living alone on a small farm, which is
the subject of this action. The plaintiff, William J. Hood, is her
brother-in-law. She

married his brother. The defendant Almon B. Farwell is her
brother, and the defendant Howard A. Webster her nephew. Mrs. Hood was left by

her husband with this farm and no money with the exception
of a mortgage of $1,200 upon property in Nebraska. She was desirous and anxious

to get enough money to live on the farm and the plaintiff
proposed to give it to her during her natural life in exchange for the farm.
She was

brought in January of 1913 to the office of the plaintiff’s
lawyer, at which time she executed a deed of the farm to the plaintiff and also
an

agreement, which was part and parcel of one transaction,
wherein the plaintiff agreed to pay her $200 a year as long as she lived. The
deed was

not given

#924

to the plaintiff; it was given to the lawyer to hold in
escrow for no other purpose that can be imagined except to insure the
plaintiff’s paying the

$200 a year and keeping his agreement. The delivery of the
deed in escrow and the promise of the plaintiff were all one and the same
transaction,

and the payment of the money by the plaintiff was clearly a
condition precedent to be fulfilled before he was entitled to the deed.
Florence Hood

lived for twenty years thereafter and died on the 29th day
of January, 1933. The plaintiff broke all his promises and agreements. He never
paid

her a dollar, so far as this record shows. He owed her at
the time of her death $4,000, not counting simple interest, and the courts
below, dealing

in equity, have turned over to him the farm, without
requiring the plaintiff to do equity and pay to the estate the money he owes.

The agreement drawn by the plaintiff’s lawyer went so far as
to require Florence Hood, during all the years that she lived, to work the farm

and to pay out of its produce all the taxes and upkeep, and
this she did. Florence Hood repudiated the plaintiff, no doubt because of his
failure to

pay her any money or to keep his agreement, and in 1928
executed and delivered a deed of the farm to Howard A. Webster, her nephew, who
had

come to live with her and help her on the farm. This deed
has been recorded and is the one which the plaintiff seeks to set aside and
which the

courts below have set aside in the face of the plaintiff’s
default. In this I think the courts were clearly in error as there is no
evidence to justify the

conclusion that the farm was to be given or the deed to it
turned over to the plaintiff without any consideration or regard whatever to
his

obligations, acts, or responsibilities. Even the $1,200
mortgage on the Nebraska property was given to the plaintiff in 1913 on the
understanding

and agreement that he was to support and care for his
sister-in-law by paying $200 a year. This apparently he still keeps or has
disposed of.

When we consider that this elderly widow had nothing but a
farm which had to be worked, and was in fear and dread of financial distress,

there is only one possible conclusion, in my judgment, to be
drawn from the execution of these instruments. Florence Hood was to give the
farm

to William Hood at her death in consideration for his paying
to her $200 a year for her to live on; and that it was never her intention or
any part

of the transaction that he should have the farm for nothing
or in default of his obligation. The courts below have given him the farm for
nothing,

so far as this record shows, instead of to the nephew who
helped his aunt work the farm in order to meet taxes, upkeep, and a living.

The record is none too full, so that the conclusions which I
have drawn are based entirely upon the evidence or lack of evidence which

appeared on the trial. As a matter of law, therefore, on
this evidence, the plaintiff failed to make out a case entitling him to
equitable relief and

the removal of the defendants’ deed from the record.

#925

The judgment should be reversed and the complaint dismissed,
with costs in all courts. * * *

Judgment affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .What kind of recording act does New York have? Who should
have the burden of production on consideration and good faith? The burden of

persuasion?

2 .What should qualify as “consideration” in order to make
someone a purchaser “for value”? The original purpose of the “value”
requirement in

good faith purchase doctrine was to protect reasonable
reliance. Was there such reliance here? Most courts require substantial and not
nominal

consideration, do not require full market value to be paid,
but do not allow love and affection or familial relationship to count. See Dale
A. Whitman et

al., The Law of Property § 11. 10 , at 774 – 75 ( 4 th ed.
2019 ). Why doesn’t the nephew’s agreement to move onto the farm to help his
widowed aunt count

as “consideration”?

3 .Is the majority expressing a preference for the _nemo
dat_ baseline? Why is it assumed that _nemo dat_ favors the plaintiff? Note
that, because the

plaintiff’s deed was only delivered into escrow, it is not
prior to the nephew’s deed unless the court treats it equitably as “relating
back” to the time of

delivery into escrow. Should equity be applied here (see the
next Note)? Does the majority seem to think Mrs. Webster did something wrong?
Does its

decision undermine the policy of the recording act of
allowing good faith purchasers to rely on the land records? As far as making
the land records

reliable here, who is the cheapest cost avoider? Does the
fact that all of the parties here have some family connection influence the
dissent? How about

the majority?

4 .The action to annul a recorded deed is likewise an
equitable one. Because the holder of the prior unrecorded deed was seeking an
equitable

remedy, shouldn’t an equity court have asked whether he
himself had done equity—in accord with the maxim “he who seeks equity must do
equity.”

(See Chapter IV.) If one takes the dissent’s view of the
facts, should the court have denied relief on that ground alone, or at least
conditioned the

requested annulment on his paying Mrs. Webster’s estate
everything he had inequitably withheld from her, with interest? Is this an
example of New York

courts carrying out the merger of law and equity in the
wrong way?

The Limits of Title Searches

Performing the prescribed title search and applying the
recording act in effect in the jurisdiction do not necessarily resolve the
question of

who has title. A title search that turns up a clean title is
not the end of the story. There are off-record matters that may still bind (or
totally

deprive) a subsequent bona fide purchaser. As we have seen,
forgeries and frauds can lead to claims—especially if the fraud victim is
wholly

blameless—that a title search might not turn up. Similar
problems can

#926

arise from the incapacity of a grantor, deficiencies in the
formalities in the execution of an instrument, liens (such as those for taxes)
that are not

required to be recorded, and other matters. See Ralph L.
Straw, Jr., Off-Record Risks for Bona Fide Purchasers of Interests in Real
Property, 72

Dickinson L. Rev. 35 (1967); see also Restatement (Fourth)
of Property, Vol. 5, Div. IV, Ch. 5 (Am. L. Inst. Council Draft No. 4, Sept.
24, 2021)

(describing forgeries, fraud, duress, undue influence,
incapacitation, intoxication, minority, and legal disability as possible
problems in a chain of

title that may affect the rights of a subsequent bona fide
purchaser).

Sometimes the recording acts fail to apply on their own
terms. As we saw, most of the time this means that the nemo dat principle
applies.

In a jurisdiction with a notice statute, if O sells to A and
then to B, but B has notice, then A wins by nemo dat. Or in a race-notice
jurisdiction, if

O sells to A and then to B who has no notice, and A then
records before B, B fails to benefit from the recording act and A is the nemo
dat winner.

But when we add equitable interests into the mix, things can
get a little more complicated. A might have a beneficial interest in Blackacre
under

a trust, or A might have an equitable interest in property
in B’s hands under a constructive trust theory (say, because B stole from A and
invested

the proceeds in Blackacre). Especially in the latter
situation, A’s interest is not likely to be recorded. Generally, where a
recording act does not

apply, nemo dat or a closely related principle qui prior
tempore potior est jure (“prior in time is stronger in right”) will decide as
between the

competing interests (prior legal interest beats later legal
interest; prior equitable interest beats later equitable interest; and prior
legal interest

beats later equitable interest). But where a prior equitable
interest competes with a later legal interest, the legal interest only prevails
if it was

acquired for value and without notice. This interplay of two
equitable principles ( prior tempore , and good faith purchase for value) in
this last

scenario is indirectly the source of the notice element in
the recording acts themselves. See 14 Powell on Real Property § 82.02[3][c];
Ralph W.

Aigler, The Operation of the Recording Acts, 22 Mich. L.
Rev. 405 (1924).

As discussed earlier, the rise of electronic recording
promises to ameliorate some of these problems. Despite the convenience of
electronic

records, problems such as forged deeds and other off-record
defects remain. States differ as to whom to hold responsible in such
situations. Title

insurance helps manage some of these risks. Other risks,
like adverse possession, are not covered by title insurance policies. When
adverse

possession occurs, a new chain of title is started in the
adverse possessor. In the case of land, this can cause notice problems for
those relying on

land records, because adverse possession is not reflected in
the land records, and no recording system cuts off adverse possession claims.
This

explains the need for surveying and physical inspection
notwithstanding the cleanest of title chains as revealed by the recording
system. Probably

prospective owners are more able to detect such

#927

problems than are title companies, but before taking much
comfort in this thought, consider the following case.

#### Mugaas v. Smith

```



Supreme Court of Washington, 1949.



206 P. 2 d 332.



```

■ HILL,
JUSTICE. This is an action by Dora B. Mugaas, a widow, to quiet title to a
strip of land 135 feet in length and with a maximum width of 3

1/2 feet which she claims by adverse possession, and to
compel Delmar C. Smith and his wife to remove therefrom any and all buildings
and

encroachments. From a judgment quieting title to the strip
in Mrs. Mugaas and directing the removal of any and all buildings and
encroachments,

the Smiths appeal.

The appellants contend that the respondent has failed to
establish adverse possession of the tract in question. The character of the

respondent’s possession over the statutory period is one of
fact, and the trial court’s finding in that regard is to be given great weight
and will not

be overturned unless this court is convinced that the
evidence preponderates against that finding. We are of the opinion that the
evidence was

sufficient to sustain the trial court’s findings, and the
conclusions based thereon, that the respondent had acquired title to the strip
in question by

adverse possession. The evidence would have warranted a
finding that her adverse possession dated back to 1910.

The only serious questions raised by this appeal are
attributable to the fact that the fence which between 1910 and 1928 clearly
marked the

boundary line for which respondent contends, disappeared by
a process of disintegration in the years which followed, and, when appellants

purchased the property in 1941 by a legal description and
with a record title which included the disputed strip, there was no fence and
nothing to

mark the dividing line between the property of appellants
and respondent, or to indicate to the appellants that the respondent was
claiming title to

the strip in question.

We have on several occasions approved a statement which
appears in Towles v. Hamilton, 143 N.W. 935, 936 (Neb. 1913), that:

* * * It is elementary that, where the title has become
      fully vested by disseisin so long continued as to bar an action, it cannot be

divested by parol abandonment or relinquishment or by verbal
declarations of the disseizor, nor by any other act short of what would

be required in a case where his title was by deed.

The fact that the respondent had ceased to use the strip in
question in such a way that her claim of adverse possession was apparent did
not

divest her of the title she had acquired.

Appellants’ principal contention is that we have held, in a
long line of cases, that a bona fide purchaser of real property may rely upon
the

#928

record title. The cases cited by appellants construe our
recording statute, Rem.Rev.Stat. §§ 10596–1, 10596–2, and involve contests
between

those relying upon the record title and those relying upon a
prior unrecorded conveyance as conveyances are defined by Rem.Rev.Stat. §
10596–

1. The holdings in the cases cited give effect to that
   provision of § 10596–2 which states that any unrecorded conveyance “ * * * is
   void as

against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee in good faith
and for a valuable consideration from the same vendor, his heirs or devisees,
of the

same real property or any portion thereof whose conveyance
is first duly recorded. * * * ”

Appellants cite no cases, and we have found none, supporting
their contention that, under a recording statute such as Rem.Rev.Stat.

§§ 10596–1, 10596–2, a conveyance of the record title to a
bona fide purchaser will extinguish a title acquired by adverse possession. The
trial

judge, in his admirable memorandum decision, quoted the
following from the opinion in Ridgeway v. Holliday, 59 Mo. 444, 454 (1875):

* * * But it is contended by the defendant that he is a
      purchaser for value from Voteau who appeared from the record to be the owner,

and was in possession, without any notice of the prior
adverse possession which passed the title to Ridgeway, or of any claim on his

part to the premises; and that as against him, the
defendant, Ridgeway, cannot assert his title; that to permit him to do so,
would be

giving to an adverse possession greater force and efficacy
than is given to an unrecorded conveyance. These objections, it must be

admitted, are very forcible. The registry act, however,
cannot, in the nature of things, apply to a transfer of the legal title by
adverse

possession, and such title does not stand on the footing of
one acquired and held by an unrecorded deed, and of such title, the

purchaser may not expect to find any evidence in the
records.

He quoted, also, the following from Schall v. Williams
Valley R. Co., 35 Pa. 191, 204 (1860):

An unrecorded paper title does not affect a purchaser
without actual notice, and the learned judge pronounced a title by the statute
of

limitations, if unaccompanied by a continued possession, as
no more than an unrecorded paper title. If this be sound doctrine, then the

claimant under the statute, however he may have perfected
his right, must keep his flag flying for ever, and the statute ceases to be a

statute of limitations.

The first observation we have to make on his ruling is, that
titles matured under the statute of limitations, are not within the recording

acts. However expedient it might be to require some public
record of such titles to be kept, and however inconvenient it may be to

purchasers to ascertain what titles of that sort are
outstanding, still we have not as yet any legislation on the subject, and it is
not

competent for judicial decision to force upon

#929

them consequences drawn from the recording acts. Those acts
relate exclusively to written titles.

These cases seem to us to be directly in point, and to
afford a complete answer to appellants’ contention. However, appellants say
that these

and other cases are not applicable because legislation has
been enacted, i.e., Rem.Rev.Stat. § 10577, to bring possessory titles within
the

recording act. That section reads as follows:

Whenever any person, married or single, having in his or her
name the legal title of record to any real estate, shall sell or dispose of the

same to an actual bona fide purchaser, a deed of such real
estate from the person holding such legal record title to such actual bona fide

purchaser shall be sufficient to convey to and vest in such
purchaser the full legal and equitable title to such real estate free and clear
of

any and all claims of any and all persons whatsoever not
appearing of record in the auditor’s office of the county in which such real

estate is situated.

The appellants contend that, under this section of the
statute, the full legal and equitable title is vested in them as bona fide
purchasers from

the record title holder, and that the title acquired by
adverse possession is thereby extinguished. We again quote a sentence from the
Pennsylvania

decision:

* * * If this be sound doctrine, then the claimant under the
      statute, however he may have perfected his right, must keep his flag flying

for ever, and the statute ceases to be a statute of
limitations.

If Rem.Rev.Stat. § 10577 has the effect claimed for it by
the appellants, the only way in which a person who has acquired title by
adverse

possession could retain it against the purchaser of the
record title is to make his possession and use of the property so continuous,
so open, and so

notorious as to prevent anyone from becoming a bona fide
purchaser.

Immediately following this section in Rem.Rev.Stat., this
statement appears in italics: “This section relates to community property
only.” It

was § 1 of chapter 151 of the Laws of 1891, and the title of
the act was “An Act to protect innocent purchasers of community real property.”
The

other three sections of that act appear in Rem.Rev.Stat. as
§§ 10578, 10579, and 10580; and the act in its entirety, in accordance with its
title, is

for the protection of innocent purchasers against
undisclosed community interests. It is too clear for argument that the act
never was intended to

have, and could not have, constitutionally, in view of its
restricted title, any such application as that for which appellants contend. *

Appellants have placed too great a weight on too frail a
reed. * * *

The judgment is affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .We encountered adverse possession in Chapter II as a mode
of acquisition of property. Adverse possession can be seen as an exception to
the

_nemo dat_ principle, in that it allows shifts in title
other than by a chain of voluntary transfers. Nevertheless, recall that an
adverse possessor only holds

adversely against the present possessor. Thus, for example,
if the present possessor holds only a life estate, the adverse possessor
acquires only a life

estate at the end of the statutory period. This mimics _nemo
dat_ in that the forced transfer from the present title owner does not transfer
rights greater than

the owner had.

2 .The court seems to think that if adverse possession
claims are subject to the recording act, then the adverse possessor (AP) would
have to

maintain adverse possession forever, which would run counter
to its being based on a statute of limitations and its function to wipe away
stale claims.

How true is this? Couldn’t the AP file a quiet title action
and record the judgment, thus starting a new record chain of title? Wouldn’t it
be desirable for

the AP to do so? Does this case give the AP much incentive
to give notice? The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld statutes requiring owners of
dormant

mineral rights periodically to re-record their interest, on
pain of having the interest lapse. See Texaco, Inc. v. Short, 454 U.S. 516 (
1982 ). Would such a

lapse statute be desirable for claims based on adverse
possession?

3 .If adverse possession claims were trumped by interests
memorialized in recording acts, wouldn’t this greatly simplify the process of
ascertaining

whether the transferor of any particular piece of property
has good title? Or would it in fact make the process of ascertaining title even
more

complicated, if an adverse possessor is currently on the
property and there have also been multiple transfers and recordings of title in
the recent past?

4 .Many states have adopted legislation that reflects
something of a compromise between reliance on recording acts and allowing
claims of title

outside the record based on adverse possession. So-called
_marketable title acts_ set a period, often 30 or 40 years, beyond which claims
are deemed

extinguished and searchers need not inquire further in the
official records. See, e.g., Fla. Stat. Ann. §§ 712. 01 –. 10 ; Mich. Comp. L.
§ 565. 101 ; N.C.

Gen. Stat. § 47 B– 2 ; Utah Code Ann. §§ 57 – 9 – 1 to 57 –
9 – 10. The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws proposed
a Uniform

Marketable Title Act in 1977 as one section of the Uniform
Simplification of Land Transfers Act, which was then made into a stand-alone
model act in

1990. This act was based on an influential Michigan act,
      which was modeled on legislation adopted in 1950 in Ontario, Canada. See Walter
      E. Barnett,

Marketable Title Acts—Panacea or Pandemonium?, 53 Cornell L.
Rev. 45 , 47 , 52 – 60 ( 1967 ). Such a statute makes most interests
unenforceable after

the specified time period unless something is put in the
record within that time window. The idea is to allow people to stop title
searches at a given point

and not have to go all the way back to the sovereign. There
are exceptions (allowing continued enforcement) for interests in the nature of
easements that

give notice by their physical existence and for other

```



931



```

easements that were excepted or reserved by a recorded
instrument and evidenced by something physical.

5 .Do marketable title acts represent a kind of adverse
possession of claims based on adverse possession? Or do they have this function
only for

adverse possession claims that are no longer possessory?
Suppose the statute of limitations for adverse possession is 20 years and the
marketable title act

prescribes a period of 40 years for title examinations. B
enters A’s land in 1960 and remains on the land openly, notoriously,
continuously, exclusively,

and adversely under a claim of right for the next 45 years.
B has made no attempt to record the right to the land based on adverse
possession. In 2005 , A

transfers to C. Can C rely on the marketable title act to
extinguish B’s claim of title by adverse possession? See Dale A. Whitman et
al., The Law of

Property § 11. 12 , at 797 ( 4 th ed. 2019 ) (noting that “a
person who is occupying the land may, under some of the acts, have possession
treated as the

equivalent of notice of his or her claim”).

(^18) Some important caveats are in order. First, this ideal
completeness of the public record has often remained unfulfilled because of
organizational and legal problems, as exemplified by

the traditional problems of land records in the United
States (Cross 1957 ; Straw 1967 ). Moreover, in most jurisdictions, the
priority-of-recording rule applies only to innocent or good-faith

acquirers for value, and judges infer that such good faith
is lacking when the acquirer knew (had “notice”) of the previous transactions,
an aspect that is also illustrated by the different systems

being applied in different states in the United States
(Dukeminier and Krier 1998 , 675 – 77 ; and Merrill and Smith 2007 , 919 – 23
). Finally, acquirers must usually inspect the land to find out

about physical possession, as this inspection provides
actual notice as to the existence of a claim or right. * * *

(^20) The rationale here is similar to the theory of the
_numerus clausus_ of property rights in Merrill and Smith ( 2000 ), who argue
that the possibility that parties might invent idiosyncratic

rights _in rem_ would raise the information cost and thus
the cost of contracting for all other participants (mainly, 26 – 34 ).

## CHAPTER IX

# THE LAW OF NEIGHBORS

A world in which owners simply had the basic right to
exclude is one in which many problems would be left unsolved. As we have seen,

not all physical invasions are severe enough to warrant
giving the owner any power of veto—think of high-altitude airplane overflights.
Other

invasions, while significant, are closer cases in terms of
whether to permit owners to exclude, or not to exclude, or to force them to
allow the

invasion but at a judicially determined price. The uses to
which neighboring property is put can also have an impact on the value and
enjoyment

of land even if there is nothing in the nature of an
invasion at all.

This Chapter will consider a range of legal devices to
control conflicts among neighbors over incompatible uses of land. The principal

devices considered are nuisance liability, servitudes
(easements and covenants), and zoning. As solutions to land-use conflicts,
these devices

correspond roughly to tort, contract, and regulation. Each
of these devices presents some special issues, but they are often functional
substitutes;

for example, noise problems could be controlled by the law
of nuisance, by covenants negotiated by neighbors or their predecessors, or by

restrictions on commercial activities through the law of
zoning. Sometimes more than one device may apply to the same problem, and
sometimes

they complement each other.

### A. NUISANCE

### 1 .THE BASIC FRAMEWORK

Nuisance law has been termed a doctrinal “mess” and
“mystery”—and even a “garbage can of law”—but the traditional starting point
for

nuisance is where trespass leaves off. Recall from Chapter I
that relatively large intrusions of land are controlled by the law of trespass,
which at

least insofar as intentional intrusions are concerned,
imposes a simple rule (no trespassing) subject to some exceptions (considered
in Chapter IV,

such as the defense of necessity and antidiscrimination
laws). Lesser intrusions that go only to use and enjoyment of land are governed
by the

law of nuisance. In Chapter I, we encountered a nuisance
case, Hendricks v. Stalnaker , which involved the court in a balancing of a
water well

and a septic system. The court found the defendant’s well
not to be a nuisance even though under local spacing regulations the plaintiffs
were no

longer able to operate a septic system on their property.

Hendricks is not unusual in claiming that the law of
nuisance requires the court to balance the utility of two conflicting uses. The

Restatement of Torts , which the court invoked, says that
when a

#934

nontrespassory invasion of land is intentional, the question
is whether the interference is substantial and unreasonable. Because an
interference is

intentional when the actor knows or should know that the
conduct is causing harm, Restatement (Second) of Torts § 825 (1979), the

reasonableness of the interference is often an issue. The
reasonableness inquiry, according to the Restatement , calls for balancing the
value of the

competing landowners’ activities: An activity is
unreasonable if the social harm of the defendant’s activity outweighs its
social utility.

Restatement (Second) of Torts § 826–828 (1979); William L.
Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts § 87, at 581, § 89 at 596 (4th ed. 1971).
Not

all courts subscribe to the Restatement approach, however,
and where courts do not engage in explicit balancing one must ask whether some

other approach better explains the result. As we will see,
one of the reasons nuisance law appears so confused is that notions of
invasion—who

sent what where—continue to play a role in nuisance law.

#### Jost v. Dairyland Power Cooperative

```



Supreme Court of Wisconsin, 1969.



172 N.W. 2 d 647.



```

The action is one for damages for injury to crops and loss
of market value of farm lands. The plaintiffs are farmers living within, or
near, the

city limits of Alma, Wisconsin. Their farms are located on
the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River. In 1947 the Dairyland Power

Cooperative erected a coal burning electric generating plant
at Alma. It is the contention of the farmers that consumption of
high-sulfur-content

coal at this plant has increased from 300 tons per day in
1948 to 1,670 tons per day in 1967. There was testimony that the 1967 coal
consumption

resulted in discharging approximately 90 tons of
sulfur-dioxide gas into the atmosphere each day. There was substantial evidence
to show that the

sulphur-dioxide gas, under certain atmospheric conditions,
settled on the fields, causing a whitening of the alfalfa leaves and a dropping
off of

some of the vegetation. There was also testimony to show
that the sulphur compounds resulting from the industrial pollution killed pine
trees,

caused screens to rust through rapidly, and made flower
raising difficult or impossible. There was some testimony to show that some of
the

sulphur came from locomotives or from river barges, but
there was testimony that the power plant was the source of most of the
contamination.

Defendant’s witness, a farmer who was ‘hit’ less frequently
by the sulphurous fumes, estimated his crop damage at 5 percent. There was also

evidence of damage to apple trees, sumac, and wild grape, in
addition to the alfalfa damage.

Each of the plaintiff farmers testified that his land had
diminished in value as the result of the continuing crop loss.

Defendant offered testimony of realtors to the effect that
there had been no diminution of market value. One of these witnesses was the

#935

assessor of the city of Alma. Two of the three farms were on
the city’s tax roll. * * *

■
HEFFERNAN, JUSTICE. [The court begins by distinguishing nuisance and
negligence, the latter being based on injury stemming from a lack of due

care. Although some nuisances arise from negligent behavior,
a lack of due care is not required for a nuisance, and something can be a
nuisance

even if it is carried on according to industry standards of
due care.] * * *

The jury found that Dairyland Power Cooperative produced its
power in such a manner as to constitute a continuing nuisance to the

plaintiffs. The following question was, however, answered
“no” by the jury, “Did such nuisance cause substantial damage to their alfalfa
crops

and lands?” Nevertheless, the jury found the damage to the
Jost alfalfa crops amounted to $250 for each of the two years, the Andrew Noll

damage to $145 for each year, and the Norbert Noll damage to
$145 for each year. In addition, Andrew Noll’s farm was found to have sustained

a $500 diminution in market value.

Appellant claims that the trial judge erred in changing the
answer to the substantial damage question from “no” to “yes.” It should be
noted

that this question posed more than one point for the jury’s
determination; one, did the nuisance cause the damage, and, two, was the damage

substantial. The cause element of the question, however, is
not argued; and all that defendant contends is that the damage, though caused
by the

nuisance, was not substantial and that, therefore, the court
erred in changing the jury’s answer. The rule is clear. A trial court may not
change the

jury’s answer to a question unless it appears that the
answer is not supported by any “credible evidence.”

The damage to the alfalfa crop was undisputed. Even
Danzinger, the neighboring farmer who testified, ostensibly for the defendant,

estimated the crop damage at 5 percent. Moreover, the jury
found the damage to the alfalfa crop alone to be not less than $200 for the
least

damaged of the plaintiffs. The court defined substantial
damage as:

... a sum, assessed by way of damages, which is worth
having; opposed to nominal damages, which are assessed to satisfy a bare

legal right. Substantial damages are damages which are
considerable in amount and intended as a real compensation for a real injury.

The jury was properly instructed. The sums found for crop
damage, though meager, are supported by the evidence. Having found such sums

to be justly owing, it appears that by no rationalization
can it be concluded that the sums properly payable did not constitute
‘substantial

damage.’ In the oft-quoted case, Pennoyer v. Allen , 14 N.W.
609 (Wis. 1883), the court points out that only a “substantial injury” is

[compensable] or protected against by law. Substantial
injury is defined as “tangible” injury, or as a “discomfort perceptible to the
senses of

#936

ordinary people.” The Restatement, 4 Torts, p. 246, sec.
827, follows the same rationale:

... where the invasion involves physical damage to tangible
property, the gravity of the harm is ordinarily regarded as great even

though the extent of the harm is relatively small. But where
the invasion involves only personal discomfort and annoyance, the gravity

of the harm is generally regarded as slight unless the
invasion is substantial and continuing.’ See, also, Prosser, supra, p. 599.

Here the damage was to tangible property. The damage was
apparent and undisputed. * * *

We conclude that the injury was substantial as a matter of
law, since under the reasoning of Pennoyer , supra, and the Restatement, the
injury

was obvious injury to tangible property. Moreover, it was,
in fact, of such a nature that the jury placed more than a nominal value upon
the injury

done.

Defendant strenuously argues that it was prejudiced by the
court’s refusal to permit certain testimony, particularly testimony that tended
to

show that defendant had used due care in the construction
and operation of its plant, and to show that the social and economic utility of
the Alma

plant outweighed the gravity of damage to the plaintiffs.

Defendant’s contention that the evidence should have been
admitted rests on two theories; one, that due care, if shown, defeats a claim
for

nuisance, and, two, that, if the social utility of the
offending industry substantially outweighs the gravity of the harm, the
plaintiffs cannot recover

damages.

We can agree with neither proposition. As this court pointed
out in Bell v. Gray-Robinson Construction Co. , 62 N.W.2d 390, 392 (Wis.

1954):

A nuisance not rest on the degree of care used... but on the
degree of danger existing even with the best of care. (Citing

authority) To constitute a nuisance, the wrongfulness must
have been in the acts themselves ( i.e. , the consequence of the acts) rather

than in the failure to use the requisite degree of care in
doing them....

* * * In any event it is apparent that a continued invasion
      of a plaintiff’s interests by non-negligent conduct, when the actor knows of
      the

nature of the injury inflicted, is an intentional tort, and
the fact the hurt is administered non-negligently is not a defense to
liability. See Prosser,

supra, pp. 594 ff., sec. 88; Restatement, supra, p. 226,
sec. 822.

It is thus apparent that the facts tending to show freedom
from negligence would not have constituted a defense to plaintiffs’ nuisance

action. * * *

While there are some jurisdictions that permit the balancing
of the utility of the offending conduct against the gravity of the injury
inflicted,

#937

it is clear that the rule permitting such balancing, is not
approved in Wisconsin where the action is for damages. We said in Pennoyer v.
Allen ,

supra, 14 N.W. at 613:

When such comfort and enjoyment are so impaired, and
compensation is demanded, it is no defense to show that such business

was conducted in a reasonable and proper manner, and with
more than ordinary cleanliness, and that the odors so sent over and upon

such adjacent premises were only such as were incident to
the business when properly conducted. It is the interruption of such

enjoyment and the destruction of such comfort that furnishes
the ground of action, and it is no satisfaction to the injured party to be

informed that it might have been done with more aggravation.
The business is lawful; but such interruption and destruction is an

invasion of private rights, and to that extent unlawful. It
is not so much the manner of doing as the proximity of such a business to the

adjacent occupant which causes the annoyance. A business
necessarily contaminating the atmosphere to the extent indicated should be

located where it will not necessarily deprive others of the
enjoyment of their property, or less their comfort while enjoying the same.

In Dolata v. Berthelet Fuel & Supply Co. , 36 N.W.2d 97,
99 (Wis. 1949), relying on Pennoyer, this court concluded that even though a

coalyard was operated properly, nevertheless, it, a socially
and economically useful business, would be abated if it caused substantial
damage to

the adjoining plaintiff.

It appears clear that the doctrine of comparative injury is
not entertained in Wisconsin in damage suits for nuisance. In Abdella v. Smith
, 149

N.W.2d 537 (Wis. 1967), the doctrine was alluded to by a
citation from Prosser. The case involved not an action for damages, but an
injunction to

abate the nuisance. The same problem was discussed in the
earlier case of Holman v. Mineral Point Zinc Co. , 115 N.W. 327 (1908), where,
in an

action for damages occasioned by sulphurous fumes, defendant
sought to rely on the theory that injury to a socially and economically useful

factory by the granting of relief would outweigh the
possible or actual injury to the plaintiff. This court stated, in discussing a
case cited by the

parties therein:

“That was a suit to enjoin the operation of a copper smelter
as a nuisance, and for damages occasioned by the destruction of

timber on near-by lands. It is there held that, where an
owner of property cannot use the same at all without indirectly injuriously

affecting the property of another, the sound discretion of a
court of equity is invoked when it is appealed to and asked to abate such use

as a nuisance, and in such case the court will consider the
comparative injury which will result from the granting or refusing of an

injunction, and that it will not be

#938

granted when it would cause a large loss to the defendant,
while the injury to the plaintiff, if refused, will be comparatively slight and

can be compensated by damages. That decision could only be
applicable on the question of the abatement of the nuisance, as the right

of the plaintiff to recover damages is distinctly
recognized. As already stated, this is an action to abate the nuisance and for
damages,

and the complaint is not demurrable, if otherwise
sufficient, simply because the court on final hearing might not grant all the
relief that

is prayed for.” * * *

1 15 N.W. at 329.

As in Holman , the question of comparative injury is not
before us, since this is a suit for damages, not abatement of a nuisance.
Defendant

nevertheless urges us to adopt the rule of the Restatement,
which he contends applies the rule to damage suits for nuisance. It should be
pointed

out, however, that the Restatement recognizes that:

For the purpose of determining liability for damages for
private nuisance, conduct may be regarded as unreasonable even though

its utility is great and the amount of harm is relatively
small.... It may be reasonable to continue an important activity if payment is

made for the harm it is causing, but unreasonable to
continue it without paying.” Restatement, 4 Torts, p. 224, ch. 40.

Prosser, supra, page 621, too, states:

In an action for damages, the relative hardship upon the
plaintiff and the defendant is not material, once the nuisance is found to

exist.

We therefore conclude that the court properly excluded all
evidence that tended to show the utility of the Dairyland Cooperative’s

enterprise. Whether its economic or social importance
dwarfed the claim of a small farmer is of no consequence in this lawsuit. It
will not be said

that, because a great and socially useful enterprise will be
liable in damages, an injury small by comparison should so unredressed. We know
of

no acceptable rule of jurisprudence that permits those who
are engaged in important and desirable enterprises to injure with impunity
those who

are engaged in enterprises of lesser economic significance.
Even the government or other entities, including public utilities, endowed with
the

power of eminent domain—the power to take private property
in order to devote it to a purpose beneficial to the public good—are obliged to
pay

a fair market value for what is taken or damaged. To contend
that a public utility, in the pursuit of its praiseworthy and legitimate
enterprise, can,

in effect, deprive others of the full use of their property
without compensation, poses a theory unknown to the law of Wisconsin, and in
our

opinion would constitute the taking of property without due
process of law.

#939

We adhere to the rule of Pennoyer v. Allen. Although written
in 1 883, we believe it remains completely applicable under modern conditions.

We conclude that injuries caused by air pollution or other
nuisance must be compensated irrespective of the utility of the offending
conduct as

compared to the injury. Nor do we imply that a different
rule should apply where the remedy sought is abatement rather than damages.
That point

is not considered herein. We consider that the rule of
Dolata continues to be the law in Wisconsin where the action is for abatement.

We conclude, however, that the court erred in concluding
that the evidence failed to show a diminution in the market value. The evidence

was uncontradicted that the value of crops raised had
diminished in value and that certain types of vegetation were dying out or had
died out

completely. It is clear that the nuisance has continued for
several years and will continue for an indefinite period into the future.

The jury found there was a continuing nuisance. Under these
circumstances, we conclude that the injury was permanent and that, as a matter

of law, the market value of the land was diminished. See
McCormick, Damages (hornbook series), p. 500, sec. 127. How much it was
diminished

we need not determine, since we are satisfied that there
should be a new trial on the issue of diminution of market value only in regard
to the real

property of all plaintiffs.

We see no basis for the jury’s conclusion that the market
value of one of the farms was reduced by $500 and the value of the others not
at

all. Such a result—although there could have been a
differential—is completely unsupported by the evidence.

We conclude that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover for
the crops and damage to vegetation for the years complained of—1965 and 1966—

as found by the jury, but after those years recovery cannot
again be for specific items of damage on a year-by-year basis. Their avenue for

compensation is for permanent and continuing nuisance as may
be reflected in a diminution of market value. Of course, permitting a recovery

now for a permanent loss of market value presupposes that
the degree of nuisance will not increase. If such be the case, an award of
damages for

loss of market value is final. If, however, the level of
nuisance and air pollution should be increased above the level that may now be
determined

by a jury, with a consequent additional injury the
plaintiffs would have the right to seek additional permanent damage to
compensate them for the

additional diminished market value.

Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part consistent
with this opinion.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .In rejecting the pure balancing approach, the court in
_Jost_ acknowledges that other courts and to some extent the Restatement
(Second) of Torts

allow the value of the respective parties’ activities to
factor into the

```



940



```

determination of reasonableness. The term “reasonable” crops
up often in the common law, most prominently in the law of negligence. There it
refers to

an evaluation of the _defendant_ ’s activity, which includes
both its costs and benefits. The court in _Jost_ in parts of the opinion not
excerpted here was

adamant in keeping the two torts separate. For an argument
that negligence and nuisance should both be about balancing costs and benefits
of the

defendant’s activities, see, e.g., William M. Landes &
Richard A. Posner, The Economic Structure of Tort Law, 48 – 50 ( 1987 ). Like
the court in _Jost_ ,

others see nuisance as distinct and based on equal right
given background expectations about the use and enjoyment of land. See, e.g.,
Gregory C.

Keating, Nuisance as a Strict Liability Wrong, 4 J. Tort L.
1 ( 2012 ).

2 .Even if it is distinct from reasonableness in negligence,
pinpointing what is “reasonable” for purposes of nuisance has been hard to
formulate

(contributing to the “mystery” of nuisance). It is often
said that the focus in nuisance is on the reasonableness of the impact on the
use and enjoyment of

the plaintiff’s land, considering the nature of the locality
(as in the next case). In older law, this analysis traveled under the banner of
the maxim _sic utere

tuo ut alienum non laedas_ , “use what is yours so as not to
injure what belongs to another,” which we will encounter later. This idea is
often said to be

question begging, but often what it referred to was a
reconciliation of presumptive but conflicting rights in the two
parties—generating electricity and

growing alfalfa, treating waste in septic tanks and drawing
water from wells, etc. Resolving such conflicts involves a structured set of
inquiries about

how important uses are. For courts like _Jost_ , this is not
cost-benefit analysis, but turns on such factors as whether the intrusion
causes physical damage

to the plaintiff’s property. The touchstone is the impact on
the plaintiff’s use and enjoyment. Courts also tend to recognize that there are
some activities

—such as those that are prohibited by statute or extreme
interferences that would be offensive anywhere and anytime (nuisances per se)
or activities

done purely out of spite—that also count as nuisances. For
one formulation, see Restatement (Fourth) of Property, Vol. 2 , Div. I, § 7. 2
(Am. L. Inst.

Council Draft No. 4 , Sept. 24 , 2021 ). When all is said
and done, would all-things-considered balancing be better?

3 .Is the court in _Jost_ right that the value of the
offending activity should never be taken into account? The court itself alluded
to the possibility that

hardship to the defendant might factor into whether an
injunction is appropriate (more on this later). Are there any circumstances in
which physical

damage from an activity can fail to count as a nuisance even
for purposes of damages? What if the activity brings benefits to the entire
local

community? Does it matter that the polluter has not made any
attempt to acquire easements from surrounding landowners?

4 .Nuisance has always been called upon to handle conflicts
between agricultural and residential uses. Recently, in response to worries
about farms

being pushed out of business through nuisance suits, every
state has passed some kind of right-to-farm law that protects agricultural
operations against a

range of nuisance claims. A couple of states have even
amended their constitutions in this direction. See generally Jonathan Morris,
“One

```



941



```

Ought Not Have So Delicate A Nose”: CAFOs, Agricultural
Nuisance, and the Rise of the Right to Farm, 47 Envtl. L. 261 ( 2017 ).

5 .What would Coase say about the conflict in _Jost_? Recall
that the well-versus-septic-system conflict in _Hendricks v. Stalnaker_
(Chapter I)

presented at first glance a fairly reciprocal problem (but
did it?), which was reflected in the court’s rhetoric of balancing. In
rejecting balancing, the court

in _Jost_ sees nuisance as involving something other than
reciprocal harms. Is there another sense, though, in which the court emphasizes
symmetry at the

level of rights? If nuisance is about reconciling
conflicting presumptive rights, the process traditionally was required to be
symmetric: determining

which set of rights maximized mutual freedom or usefulness
of land. What A could do to B would be mirrored by what B could do to A.
Engaging in a

very valuable use did not give one special weight in the
determination of these mutual rights and duties. On the other hand, can one
always formulate

rights and duties as symmetric? Farmer Jost had a right in
the abstract to run an electricity-generating plant, but how realistic was
that? Or is the point

that special solicitude for running the plant would violate
prevailing norms and expectations in the locality? Consider the following case,
which reflects

a conflict similar to the one in _Jost_ , but reflects a
type of analysis that tended to prevail before the issue of whether to engage
in balancing (or not) came

to dominate nuisance law.

#### Campbell v. Seaman

```



Court of Appeals of New York, 1876.



63 N.Y. 568.



```

■ EARL,
J. The plaintiffs owned about forty acres of land, situate in the village of
Castleton, on the east bank of the Hudson river, and had owned

it since about 1849. During the years 1857, 1858 and 1859
they built upon it an expensive dwelling-house, and during those years, and
before

and since, they improved the land by grading and terracing,
building roads and walks through the same, and planting trees and shrubs, both

ornamental and useful.

The defendant had for some years owned adjoining lands,
which he had used as a brick-yard. The brick-yard is southerly of plaintiffs’

dwelling-house about 1,320 feet, and southerly of their
woods about 567 feet. In burning bricks defendant had made use of anthracite
coal.

During the burning of a kiln sulphuric acid gas is
generated, which is destructive to some kinds of trees and vines. The evidence
shows, and the

referee found, that gas coming from defendant’s kilns had,
during the years 1869 and 1870, killed the foliage on plaintiff’s white and
yellow,

pines and Norway spruce, and had, after repeated attacks,
killed and destroyed from 100 to 150 valuable pine and spruce trees, and had
injured

their grape vines and plum trees, and he estimated
plaintiff’s damages from the gas during those years at $500.

#942

This gas did not continually escape during the burning of a
kiln, but only during the last two days, and was carried into and over
plaintiff’s

land only when the wind was from the south.

It is a general rule that every person may exercise
exclusive dominion over his own property, and subject it to such uses as will
best

subserve his private interests. Generally, no other person
can say how he shall use or what he shall do with his property. But this
general right of

property has its exceptions and qualifications. Sic utere
tuo ut alienum non laedas * is an old maxim which has a broad application. It
does not

mean that one must never use his own so as to do any injury
to his neighbor or his property. Such a rule could not be enforced in civilized

society. Persons living in organized communities must suffer
some damage, annoyance and inconvenience from each other. For these they are

compensated by all the advantages of civilized society. If
one lives in the city he must expect to suffer the dirt, smoke, noisome odors,
noise and

confusion incident to city life. As Lord Justice James
beautifully said, in Salvin v. North Brancepeth Coal Co., (1874) L. R. 9 Ch.
App. 705: “If

some picturesque haven opens its arms to invite the commerce
of the world, it is not for this court to forbid the embrace, although the
fruit of it

should be the sights and sounds and smells of a common
seaport and ship-building town which would drive the Dryads and their masters
from

their ancient solitudes.”

But every person is bound to make a reasonable use of his
property so as to occasion no unnecessary damage or annoyance to his neighbor.

If he make an unreasonable, unwarrantable or unlawful use of
it, so as to produce material annoyance, inconvenience, discomfort or hurt to
his

neighbor, he will be guilty of a nuisance to his neighbor.
And the law will hold him responsible for the consequent damage. As to what is
a

reasonable use of one’s own property [this] cannot be
defined by any certain general rules, but must depend upon the circumstances of
each case.

A use of property in one locality and under some
circumstances may be lawful and reasonable, which, under other circumstances,
would be

unlawful, unreasonable and a nuisance. To constitute a
nuisance, the use must be such as to produce a tangible and appreciable injury
to

neighboring property, or such as to render its enjoyment
specially uncomfortable or inconvenient.

Within the rules thus referred to, that defendant’s brick
burning was a nuisance to plaintiffs cannot be doubted. Numerous cases might be

cited, but it will be sufficient to cite, mainly, those
where the precise question was involved in reference to brick burning. * * *

Hole v. Barlow , (1858) 140 Eng. Rep. 1113 (C.P.), * * * was
an action for a nuisance arising from the burning of bricks on defendant’s own

land near to the plaintiff’s dwelling-house, and the judge
at the trial told the jury that no action lies for the reasonable use of a
lawful trade in a

#943

convenient and proper place, even though some one may suffer
inconvenience from its being carried on * * *.

In Bamford v. Turnley, Cockburn, J., before whom the case
was tried, followed Hole v. Barlow, and charged the jury that if they thought
the

spot was convenient and proper, and that the use by the
defendant of his premises was, under the circumstances, a reasonable use of his
own

land, he would be entitled to a verdict. The jury found for
the defendant, but upon the hearing in the Exchequer Chamber it was held that
the

instructions were erroneous, and that it was no answer in an
action for a nuisance creating actual annoyance and discomfort in the enjoyment
of

neighboring property that the injury resulted from a
reasonable use of the property, and that the act was done in a convenient
place, nor that the

same business had been carried on in the same locality for
seventeen years. The doctrine of Hole v. Barlow was distinctly repudiated, and
that

case was in terms overruled. * * *

In this country, so far as I can ascertain, the question of
nuisance from brick burning has rarely been before the courts. The only case to

which our attention has been called is Huckenstine’s Appeal
, 70 Pa. 102 (1871). In that case Agnew, J., says: “Brick making is a useful
and

necessary employment and must be pursued near to towns and
cities where bricks are chiefly used. Brick burning, an essential part of the

business, is not a nuisance per se. (Attorney-General v.
Cleaver, (1 81 1) 34 Eng. Rep. 2 97, 301 (Ch.).) It, as many useful employments
do, may

produce some discomfort and even some injury to those near
by, but it does not follow that a chancellor would enjoin therefore.” He then
goes on

to say that the aid of an injunction is not matter of right,
but of grace, and concludes that there were so many similar nuisances in the
locality that

it was not clear that this nuisance increased the discomfort
from them, and that it was doubtful whether the plaintiff had suffered any
material

damage from the acts, and therefore held that an injunction
ought not to issue and that the plaintiff should be left to his remedy at law.

---

Without further citation of authority I think it may safely
be said that no definition of nuisance can be found in any text book or
reported decision

which will not embrace this case.

But the claim is made that although the brick burning in
this case is a nuisance, a court of equity will not and ought not to restrain
it, and the

plaintiffs should be left to their remedy at law to recover
damages, and this claim must now be examined.

Prior to Lord Eldon’s time, injunctions were rarely issued
by courts of equity. During the many years he sat upon the woolsack this remedy

was resorted to with increasing frequency, and with the
development of equity jurisprudence, which has taken place since his time, it
is well said

that the writ of injunction has become the right arm of the
court. It was formerly rarely issued in the case of a nuisance until
plaintiff’s right had

been established at law, and the doctrine which seems now to
prevail in Pennsylvania, that this writ is not matter of right, but of grace,
to a large

#944

extent prevailed. But now a suit at law is no longer a
necessary preliminary, and the right to an injunction, in a proper case, in
England and most

of the States, is just as fixed and certain as the right to
any other provisional remedy. The writ can rightfully be demanded to prevent
irreparable

injury, interminable litigation and a multiplicity of suits,
and its refusal in a proper case would be error to be corrected by an appellate
tribunal. It

is matter of grace in no sense except that it rests in the
sound discretion of the court, and that discretion is not an arbitrary one. If
improperly

exercised in any case either in granting or refusing it, the
error is one to be corrected upon appeal. Here the remedy at law was not
adequate. The

mischief was substantial and, within the principle laid down
in the cases above cited and others to which our attention has been called,

irreparable.

The plaintiffs had built a costly mansion and had laid out
their grounds and planted them with ornamental and useful trees and vines, for

their comfort and enjoyment. How can one be compensated in
damages for the destruction of his ornamental trees, and the flowers and vines

which surrounded his home? How can a jury estimate their
value in dollars and cents? The fact that trees and vines are for ornament or
luxury

entitles them no less to the protection of the law. Every
one has the right to surround himself with articles of luxury, and he will be
no less

protected than one who provides himself only with articles
of necessity. The law will protect a flower or a vine as well as an oak. (Cooke
v.

Forbes, (1867) 5 L.R. Eq. 166 (V.C.); Broadbent v. Imperial
Gas Co., (1857) 44 Eng. Rep. 170 (Ch.).) These damages are irreparable too,

because the trees and vines cannot be replaced, and the law
will not compel a person to take money rather than the objects of beauty and
utility

which he places around his dwelling to gratify his taste or
to promote his comfort and his health.

Here the injunction also prevents a multiplicity of suits.
The injury is a recurring one, and every time the poisonous breath from
defendant’s

brick-kiln sweeps over plaintiffs’ land they have a cause of
action. Unless the nuisance be restrained the litigation would be interminable.
The

policy of the law favors, and the peace and good order of
society are best promoted by the termination of such litigations by a single
suit.

The fact that this nuisance is not continual, and that the
injury is only occasional, furnishes no answer to the claim for an injunction.
The

nuisance has occurred often enough within two years to do
the plaintiffs large damage. Every time a kiln is burned some injury may be
expected,

unless the wind should blow the poisonous gas away from
plaintiffs’ lands. Nuisances causing damage less frequently have been
restrained.

It matters not that the brick-yard was used before
plaintiffs bought their lands or built their houses. One cannot erect a
nuisance upon his

land adjoining vacant lands owned by another and thus
measurably control the uses to which his neighbor’s land may in the future be
subjected.

He may make a reasonable and lawful use of his land and thus

#945

cause his neighbor some inconvenience, and probably some
damage which the law would regard as damnum absque injuria. * But he cannot

place upon his land any thing which the law would pronounce
a nuisance, and thus compel his neighbor to leave his land vacant, or to use it
in

such way only as the neighboring nuisance will allow.

It is claimed that the plaintiffs so far acquiesced in this
nuisance as to bar them from any equitable relief. I do not perceive how any

acquiescence short of twenty years can bar one from
complaining of a nuisance, unless his conduct has been such as to estop him.
There is no

proof that plaintiffs, when they bought their lands, knew
that any one intended to burn any bricks upon the land now owned by defendant.
From

about 1840 to 1853 no bricks were burned there. Then from
1853 to 1857 bricks were burned there, and then not again until 1867. From 1857
to

1867 the brick yard was plowed and used for agricultural
purposes. Before suit brought, plaintiffs objected to the brick burning. No act
or

omission of theirs induced the defendant to incur large
expenses or to take any action which could be the basis of an estoppel against
them, and

therefore there was no acquiescence or laches which should
bar the plaintiffs, within any rule laid down in any reported case.

It is true that if a party sleeps on his rights and allows a
nuisance to go on without remonstrance or without taking measures either by
suit at

law or in equity to protect his rights, and allows one to go
on making large expenditures about the business which constitutes the nuisance,
he

will sometimes be regarded as guilty of such laches as to
deprive him of equitable relief. But this is not such a case.

The defendant claims a prescriptive right to burn bricks
upon his land and to cause the poisonous vapors to flow over plaintiffs’ lands.

Assuming that defendant could acquire by lapse of time and
continuous user the prescriptive right which he claims, there has not here been
a

continuous use and exercise of the right for twenty
consecutive years. Anthracite coal was first used for burning bricks in this
yard in 1834, and

after six years brick burning was discontinued. It was not
resumed again until about 1853, and after four years it was again discontinued,
and it

was not resumed again until 1867. So that anthracite coal,
which caused plaintiffs’ damage, had not been used in all for twenty years and

certainly not continuously in burning bricks upon the yard
now owned by defendant. If he could acquire the right claimed by prescription,
he,

and those under whom he holds, must for twenty years have
caused the poisonous gases to flow over plaintiffs’ land whenever they burned

bricks and the wind blew from the direction of the kiln.
Such a prescription neither the allegations in the answer nor the proofs upon
the trial, nor

the findings of the referee, warrant. The referee finds that
the premises of defendant have been known and used as a brick-yard for over
twenty-

five years. This is not a finding that they have been used
as a brick-yard

#946

for twenty-five years continuously, or that they have caused
the poisonous gases to flow over plaintiffs’ land for that length of time
continuously.

Where the damage to one complaining of a nuisance is small
or trifling, and the damage to the one causing the nuisance will be large in
case

he be restrained, the courts will sometimes deny an
injunction. But such is not this case; here the damage to the plaintiffs, as
found by the referee,

is large and substantial. It does not appear how much damage
the defendant will suffer from the restraint of the injunction. He does not own
the

only piece of ground where bricks can be made. We know that
material for brick making exists in all parts of our State, and particularly at

various points along the Hudson river. An injunction need
not therefore destroy defendant’s business or interfere materially with the
useful and

necessary trade of brick making. It does not appear how
valuable defendant’s land is for a brick-yard, nor how expensive are his
erections for

brick making. I think we may infer that they are not
expensive. For aught that appears, his land may be put to other use just as
profitable to him.

It does not appear that defendant’s damage from an abatement
of the nuisance will be as great as plaintiffs’ damages from its continuance.
Hence

this is not a case within any authority to which our
attention has been called, where an injunction should be denied on account of
the serious

consequences to the defendant.

We cannot apprehend that our decision in this case can
improperly embarrass those engaged in the useful trade of brick making. Similar

decisions in England, where population and human habitations
are more dense, do not appear to have produced any embarrassment. In this

country there can be no trouble to find places where brick
can be made without damage to persons living in the vicinity. It certainly
cannot be

necessary to make them in the heart of a village or in the
midst of a thickly settled community. * * *

It follows from these views that the judgment should be
affirmed. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .When the court says “[a] use of property in one locality
and under some circumstances may be lawful and reasonable, which under other

circumstances, would be unlawful, unreasonable and a
nuisance,” it is stating what is often called the “locality rule.” Did the
locality rule determine the

result here? How do we define the locality? In one famous
statement it has been said that “what would be a nuisance in _Belgrave Square_
would not

necessarily be so in _Bermondsey_ .” Sturges v. Bridgman, (
1879 ) 11 Ch. D. 852 , 855 (Eng.). (Bermondsey was an industrial district back
then; today it is

“quite the foodie mecca, with fancy lofts to match.” Tom
Dyckhoff, Let’s move to: Bermondsey, London SE 1 , GUARDIAN,
[http://www.](http://www.) theguardian. com/

money/ 2012 / jan/ 13 / bermondsey-london-se 1 -
property-review. Does this make the locality rule an engine of inequality and
environmental injustice? See

Allan Beever, The Law of Private Nuisance 31 ( 2013 )
(arguing against locality rule on these grounds); but see Christopher Essert,
Nuisance and the

Normative Boundaries of Ownership, 52 Tulsa L. Rev. 85 115 –
18 ( 2016 ) (arguing that locality as an aspect of the boundaries of ownership
does not

have inegalitarian implications). Is locality to be taken in
a looser fashion (agricultural versus urban, manufacturing versus residential)?
See Restatement

(Fourth) of Property, Vol. 2 , Div. I, Ch. 7 (Am. L. Inst.
Council Draft No. 4 , Sept. 24 , 2021 ). If the locality mattered, why did this
cut against the

defendant? The Hudson Valley in the late nineteenth century
was the largest brickmaking region, serving the fastest growing city in the
world. George V.

Hutton, The Great Hudson River Brick Industry 7 ( 2003 ).
And Castleton in particular was known for brickmaking:

```



The business of brickmaking has been a prominent industry of
the town [of Schodack] for many years, and has chiefly been carried on in and



near Castleton, where the soil is well adapted for its
manufacture. The enterprise first assumed importance about the year 1825 , and
has since



been carried on by various persons. The principal yard is
now and has been for many years operated by Nathan N. Seaman, whose sons are



now in partnership with him. Peter Niser also has a yard at
Castleton. Many thousand brick are annually shipped from this point.



```

Nathaniel Bartlett Sylvester, History of Rensselaer Co., New
York 413 ( 1880 ), available at https://archive.org/ details/ historyofrenssel
00 sylv. And yet of

Castleton the same source also says that “[t]he cultivation
of the rich soil of the town has always constituted its principal industry.”
Id. Or was the court

swayed by the apparent flexibility of location and
relocation within the area, as evidenced by the sporadic use of the works in
question?

2 .One understanding is that the locality rule relaxes the
Blackstonian exclusion regime, but only tolerates invasions that reflect
mutually beneficial

forbearance, thus maximizing the neighbors’ mutual liberty.
As long as the uses in a given area are relatively uniform, each landowner gets
what

Richard Epstein calls “implicit in-kind compensation” in the
form of an ability by the (unsuccessful) plaintiff to engage in the
complained-of use as

well. See, e.g., Richard A. Epstein, Nuisance Law:
Corrective Justice and Its Utilitarian Constraints, 8 J. Legal Stud. 49 , 88 (
1979 ); see also J.E. Penner,

Nuisance and the Character of the Neighbourhood, 5 J. Envtl.
L. 1 , 14 – 25 ( 1993 ). This live-and-let-live principle was very unlikely to
extend to

activities that cause physical damage to land. Why might
that be? And yet, short of physical damage, if a location is particularly
suited to an intense use,

courts are more forgiving in the face of claims of nuisance.
In a later case, _Tucker v. Mack Paving Co._ , 70 N.Y.S. 688 (App. Div. 1901 ),
the New York

Appellate Division distinguished _Campbell v. Seaman_ where
the defendant was engaged in mining: The operations were being conducted with

reasonable care and could not be moved, unlike the brick
yard in _Campbell_ which could be more easily removed to a more remote area. On
the question

of the nature of the plaintiffs’ and defendant’s rights the
court had this to say:

```



948



```

```



Under these circumstances we think the plaintiff has no
legal ground of complaint. The protection of property is doubtless one of the
great



reasons for government. But it is equal protection to all
which the law seeks to secure. The rule governing the rights of adjacent
landowners



in the use of their property seeks an adjustment of
conflicting interests through a reconciliation by compromise, each surrendering
something



of his absolute freedom, so that both may live. To exclude
the defendant from blasting to adapt its lot to the contemplated uses, at the
instance



of the plaintiff, would not be a compromise between
conflicting rights, but an extinguishment of the right of the one for the
benefit of the



other. This sacrifice, we think, the law does not exact.



```

Id. at 692 , quoting Booth v. Rome, Watertown &
Ogdensburg Terminal R.R. Co., 35 N.E. 592 , 596 (N.Y. 1893 ) (Andrews, C.J.).
This sounds a lot like

natural rights and Epstein’s implicit in-kind compensation,
but is it? Or is it balancing in favor of the “more valuable” use?

3 .Since the nineteenth century there has been a trend
toward some form of balancing, at least in name, although some decisions like
_Jost_ have

rejected even that. The reformulation of nuisance law in the
_First Restatement of Torts_ subsumes the locality rule into a general
utilitarian balancing test.

Restatement (First) of Torts §§ 822 , 826 ( 1939 ). Perhaps
the way for the _Restatement_ ’s balancing approach was paved by courts
sympathetic to large

employers in the Great Depression. See, e.g., Bove v.
Donner-Hanna Coke Corp., 258 N.Y.S. 229 (N.Y. App. Div. 1932 ); Todd J.
Zywicki, A

Unanimity-Reinforcing Model of Efficiency in the Common Law:
An Institutional Comparison of Common Law and Legislative Solutions to Large-

Number Externality Problems, 46 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 961 ,
1020 – 21 ( 1996 ) (discussing Great Depression era case of Versailles Borough
v.

McKeesport Coal & Coke Co., 83 Pittsburgh Legal J. 379
(Pitt. Co. Ct. 1935 ), and noting “the poor economic conditions of the time
suggested that

people in the Pittsburgh area would be willing to sacrifice
some amount of environmental quality for the assurance that their jobs would
remain intact”

and that using balancing analysis “[i]n finding for the coal
company, the court did consider the community’s depressed economic
conditions”). Indeed,

commentators have long been on the lookout for evidence of
courts softening tort liability as a “subsidy” for industry. The evidence for
the subsidy

thesis in the nineteenth century has come in for heavy
criticism. Compare Lawrence M. Friedman, A History of American Law 475 ( 2 d.
ed. 1985 );

Morton J. Horwitz, The Transformation of American Law, 1780
– 1860 , at 85 – 89 ( 1977 ) (setting forth the subsidy thesis) with A.W. Brian
Simpson,

Leading Cases in the Common Law 163 – 94 ( 1995 ); Gary T.
Schwartz, Tort Law and the Economy in Nineteenth-Century America: A
Reinterpretation,

90 Yale L.J. 1717 , 1735 – 58 ( 1981 ) (critiquing the
subsidy thesis); Gary T. Schwartz, The Character of Early American Tort Law, 36
UCLA L. Rev. 641 ,

642 – 43 ( 1989 ) (arguing that courts in the nineteenth
century were generous in upholding tort liability against defendants in
emerging industry). Some

commentators have proposed a compromise approach under which
the locality would dictate the remedy available, with damages liability for

#949

activities deemed subnormal or unneighborly in light of
community standards. See, e.g., Robert C. Ellickson, Alternatives to Zoning:
Covenants,

Nuisance Rules, and Fines as Land Use Controls, 40 U. Chi.
L. Rev. 681 , 728 – 33 ( 1973 ); Edward Rabin, Nuisance Law: Rethinking
Fundamental

Assumptions, 63 Va. L. Rev. 1299 , 1317 – 21 ( 1977 ).

4 .Pro-balancing courts, Legal Realists, and even the stray
formalist have been sharply critical of the maxim _sic utere tuo ut alienum non
laedas_ ,

invoked in _Campbell_ and in many other older nuisance
cases. According to the critics, the maxim is empty or circular, without a
substantive definition of

what counts as an injury. See Lucas v. South Carolina
Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003 , 1031 ( 1992 ) (criticizing _sic utere_ maxim
as conclusory); Hale v.

Farmers Elec. Membership Corp., 99 P. 2 d 454 , 456 (N.M.
1940 ) (holding that although _sic utere_ is a good moral precept, it is
useless as a grounds for

decision because it does not determine any right or
obligation, and citing cases and commentary to this effect); Oliver Wendell
Holmes, Privilege,

Malice, and Intent, 8 Harv. L. Rev. 1 , 3 ( 1894 )
(criticizing “hollow deductions from empty general propositions like _sic utere
tuo ut alienum non laedas_ ,

which teaches nothing but a benevolent yearning”). Do you
agree that _sic utere_ is inevitably vacuous? (See Note 2 after _Jost_ ,
supra.)

5 .One problem that has called for a contextualized analysis
is “coming to the nuisance.” At first blush, someone who buys a parcel that is
located

next to an intensive use should know what they’re getting
into. And someone introducing a sensitive use like a residence into a district
that is uniformly

commercial or industrial will tend not to prevail on a
nuisance claim. See, e.g., Gilbert v. Showerman, 23 Mich. 448 ( 1871 ) (Cooley,
J.). But, as the

opinion in _Campbell_ points out, a flat rule making the
plaintiff’s coming to the nuisance a defense means that someone can acquire
rights against

neighbors simply by being first, and as we have seen this
incentive structure leads to wasteful races to be first. In general, courts are
reluctant to grant

the defense and instead balance a number of factors,
including timing, good faith and absence of spite, the public interest in the
defendant’s activities,

and estoppel-like notions. Giving both sides an incentive to
maximize joint value of the parcels is not a trivial problem. See, e.g., Robert
Innes, Coming

to the Nuisance: Revisiting _Spur_ in a Model of Location
Choice, 25 J.L. Econ. & Org. 286 ( 2009 ); Donald Wittman, First Come,
First Served: An

Economic Analysis of “Coming to the Nuisance,” 9 J. Legal
Stud. 557 ( 1980 ). Should the doctrine aim at defining optimal behavior? If so
what is that?

Or is the problem, again, one of reconciling conflicting
presumptive rights? John C.P. Goldberg & Henry E. Smith, Wrongful Fusion:
Equity and Torts,

in Equity and Law: Fusion and Fission 309 , 315 – 18 (John
C.P. Goldberg, Peter Turner & Henry E. Smith eds., 2019 ).

6 .If we say that someone buying in the face of the nuisance
has already paid a depressed price for the land, where does that leave the
seller?

Shouldn’t the right to bring the nuisance claim be bundled
with the land? (And isn’t the price dependent on the legal rule here anyway,
making any

argument based on the “price” circular?) One might then ask,
why didn’t the earlier owner (the seller) sue? Perhaps because the seller was
not bothered

yet—for example, by not having built a house on the parcel.

```



950



```

7 .In some states, one can acquire an easement to commit
what would otherwise be a nuisance by committing the nuisance for the statutory
period

for an easement by prescription. In _Campbell_ , the brick
yard did not acquire an easement to commit the pollution because its use of
anthracite coal to

make bricks had not been continuous for the statutory period
of 20 years. When should the clock start ticking on the potential plaintiff?
When the brick

yard opens in splendid isolation? Or when the plaintiff
wants to engage in a use, like building a house with a fancy garden, that the
brick yard interferes

with? Or at some other point? Tolling the statute of
limitations until a conflict arises allows the intensive use like the brick
yard to operate in the

meantime, and the conflict may never arise. See Richard A.
Epstein, A Clear View of The Cathedral: The Dominance of Property Rules, 106
Yale L.J.

2091 , 2105 ( 1997 ).

8 .What about the reverse situation, in which the more
intensive use is newer? Should it always be considered a nuisance? Courts
recognize the

dynamic nature of land use and are not willing to let the
sensitive use preclude the entrance of more intense commercial uses for all
time, as reflected in

Judge Earl’s embrace of Lord Justice James’s remark about
Dryads and the “ancient solitudes.” How can courts recognize such a trend? Does
the

disappointed resident have reason to complain? One could say
that in such situations all the landowners have a mutual right to engage in the
new use,

but is this cold comfort to the put-upon resident?

### 2 .THE NUISANCE-TRESPASS DIVIDE

On a doctrinal level, nuisance law literally picks up where
trespass leaves off: A nuisance is commonly defined as a “nontrespassory”

invasion of land of a certain sort. Restatement (Second) of
Torts § 821D (1979). As you consider the relationship between trespass and
nuisance

and the many twists to nuisance law, consider what aspects
of nuisance law help vindicate owners’ rights to exclude and which go beyond

exclusionary rights to prescribe a governance regime for
particular use conflicts. Does nuisance law reinforce or challenge the view
that the right

to exclude is fundamental to property? To what extent does

nuisance law

■
O’CONNELL, J. Defendants appeal as of right from a jury verdict awarding
damages in trespass for invasions of plaintiffs’ property by intrusions

of dust, noise, and vibrations. The gravamen of this appeal
presents the question whether Michigan recognizes a cause of action in trespass

stemming from invasions of these intangible agents. No
published decision of an appellate court of this state is directly on point.
Because of the

importance of this issue of first impression, we will

#951

expound on it in some detail. Following a recitation of
facts, we will examine the origins of the doctrines of trespass to land and
nuisance,

observe recent developments of those doctrines in this and
other jurisdictions, and then reaffirm for this state the traditional
requirements for a

cause of action in trespass.

We conclude that the law of trespass in Michigan does not
cover airborne particulate[s], noise, or vibrations, and that a complaint
alleging

damages resulting from these irritants normally sounds
instead in nuisance.

I.Facts

Plaintiffs brought suit seeking damages in both trespass and
nuisance, complaining of dust, noise, and vibrations emanating from the

Empire Mine, which is operated by defendant Cleveland-Cliffs
Iron Company and its subsidiary, defendant Empire Iron Mining Partnership.

The Empire Mine is one of the nation’s largest mines,
producing eight million tons of iron ore annually. The mine operates
twenty-four

hours a day, year round. At the time this action was
commenced, all but three plaintiffs lived near the mine, in the village of
Palmer in Marquette

County. Cleveland-Cliffs, which also operates the nearby
Tilden Mine, employs approximately 2,200 persons, making it the area’s largest
civilian

employer.

The Empire Mine was originally dug in the 1870s, then
expanded in the 1960s. A second pit was added in 1987, and a third in
1990–91.^2

The mine engages in blasting operations approximately three
times a week, year round, and the extraction and processing of the iron ore

generates a great deal of airborne dust. Plaintiffs complain
that the blasting sends tremors through their property and that defendants’
dust

constantly accumulates inside and outside plaintiffs’ homes.
Plaintiffs assert that these emanations aggravate their need to clean and
repaint their

homes, replace carpets and drapes, repair cracks in all
masonry, replace windows, and tend to cause plumbing leaks and broken sewer
pipes.

According to the testimony, the dust from the mine is fine,
gritty, oily, and difficult to clean. Some plaintiffs complained that they
seldom

opened their windows because of the dust, and virtually
every plaintiff complained that the snow in Palmer tended to be gray or black.
Evidence

presented at trial indicates that the emissions from the
mining operations have consistently remained within applicable air-quality
standards and

that the amount of particulate matter accumulating over
Palmer each month amounts to less than the thickness of a sheet of

#952

paper, but that this amount is nonetheless four times
greater than what normally settles onto surrounding communities.

In addition to concerns about the dust, many plaintiffs
testified that the noise and vibrations from the blasts caused them to suffer
shock,

nervousness, and sleeplessness. Finally, several plaintiffs
asserted that these conditions diminished the value of their homes, in some
cases to the

point of rendering them unmarketable.

At the close of proofs, the trial court instructed the jury
concerning both trespass and nuisance. The jury found that three of the
plaintiffs

were not entitled to recover under either theory. Concerning
the remaining fifty-two plaintiffs, however, the jury was unable to agree on a
verdict

regarding the nuisance claim, but returned a verdict in
favor of these plaintiffs with regard to the trespass claim, awarding damages
totaling

$599,199. The court denied defendants’ posttrial motions for
a new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict.

The sole issue that defendants raise on appeal is the
propriety of the trial court’s jury instruction concerning plaintiffs’ trespass
claim:

Every unauthorized intrusion onto the lands of another is a
trespass upon those lands, and it gives rise to a right to recover

damages for the trespass, if any damages were caused by the
trespass. So a landowner who causes emissions, dust, vibration, noise

from his property onto another [sic] property assumes the
risk of trespass, if the dust, vibration, noise affects the

#953

neighbor’s property, or if he causes by his actions, damages
or invasion of his neighbor’s land.

So again, to repeat. A trespass is an unauthorized intrusion
into the lands of another.

II.Trespass and Nuisance

The general concept of “property” comprises various rights—a
“bundle of sticks,” as it is often called—which is usually understood to

include “[t]he exclusive right of possessing, enjoying, and
disposing of a thing.” Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed., 1990), p. 1216. As this
latter

characterization suggests, the right to exclude others from
one’s land and the right to quiet enjoyment of one’s land have customarily been

regarded as separate sticks in the bundle. * * * Thus,
possessory rights to real property include as distinct interests the right to
exclude and the

right to enjoy, violations of which give rise to the
distinct causes of action respectively of trespass and nuisance. Prosser &
Keeton, Torts (5th

ed.), § 87, p. 622.

A.Historical Overview

“At common law, trespass was a form of action brought to
recover damages for any injury to one’s person or property or relationship with

another.” Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed.), p. 1502. This
broad usage of the term “trespass” then gave way to a narrower usage, referring
to

intrusions upon a person’s “tangible property, real or
personal.” Prosser & Keeton, supra at § 13, p. 67. Today, the general
concept of “trespass”

has been refined into several specific forms of trespass,
see Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed.), pp. 1502–1504, and related doctrines
known by

various names. Landowners seeking damages or equitable
relief in response to violations of their possessory rights to land now
generally proceed

under the common-law derivatives of strict liability,
negligence, nuisance, or trespass to land. It is the latter two products of
this evolution from

the general concept of trespass that are at issue in the
present case.

“ ‘[T]respass is an invasion of the plaintiff’s interest in
the exclusive possession of his land, while nuisance is an interference with
his use

and enjoyment of it.’ ” Hadfield v. Oakland Co. Drain
Comm’r, 422 N.W.2d 205 (Mich. 1988) (Brickley, J., joined by Riley, C.J., and
Cavanagh,

J.), quoting Prosser & Keeton, supra at § 87, p. 622.
Historically, “[e]very unauthorized intrusion upon the private premises of
another is a

trespass... .” Giddings v. Rogalewski, 158 N.W. 951 (Mich.
1916). Because a trespass violated a landholder’s right to exclude others from
the

premises, the landholder could recover at least nominal
damages even in the absence of proof of any other injury. Id. Recovery for
nuisance,

however, traditionally required proof of actual and
substantial injury. Further, the doctrine of nuisance customarily called for
balancing the

disturbance complained of against the social utility of its
cause.

#954

Traditionally, trespass required that the invasion of the
land be direct or immediate and in the form of a physical, tangible object.
See, e.g.,

Williams v. Oeder, 659 N.E.2d 379, 382 n.2 (Ohio App. 1995)
(noting then abandoning those traditional requirements); Davis v.
Georgia-Pacific

Corp., 445 P.2d 481, 483 (Or. 1968) (abandoning the
traditional requirements); Norwood v. Eastern Oregon Land Co., 5 P.2d 1057,
1061 (Or.

1931), modified 7 P.2d 996 (Or. 1932) (wrongful diversion of
water onto another’s land does not constitute trespass to land). Under these

principles, recovery in trespass for dust, smoke, noise, and
vibrations was generally unavailable because they were not considered tangible
or

because they came to the land via some intervening force
such as wind or water. Instead, claims concerning these irritants were
generally pursued

under a nuisance theory.

B.Recent Trends

Plaintiffs urge this Court to hold that they are entitled to
recover in trespass for invasions of their premises by intangible things
without

regard for how these annoyances came to their land.
Plaintiffs would have us follow the example of certain courts from other
jurisdictions, which

have eliminated the traditional requirements for trespass of
a direct intrusion by a tangible object, directing the inquiry instead toward
the nature

of the interest harmed. These courts have permitted recovery
in trespass for indirect, intangible invasions that nonetheless interfered with

exclusive possessory interests in the land. See 75 Am. Jur.
2d, Trespass, § 33, p. 33 and cases cited. See also Mercer v. Rockwell Int’l
Corp., 24

F.Supp.2d 7 35, 743 (W.D. Ky. 1998) (allowing an action in
“negligent trespass” concerning intrusions of invisible polychlorinated
biphenyls

[PCBs] that actually harm the property); Williams, supra
(airborne particulate matter from a sand and gravel processing facility, an
asphalt plant,

and a concrete plant constituted trespass); Martin v.
Reynolds Metals Co., 342 P.2d 790 (Or. 1959) (trespass may stem from fluoride
compounds

in the form of gases and particles). We agree with the
characterization of cases of this sort found in Prosser & Keeton as being
“in reality,

examples of the tort of private nuisance or liability for
harm resulting from negligence,” not proper trespass cases. Prosser &
Keeton, supra at

§ 13, pp. 71 –72 (concerning “decisions finding a trespass
constituted by the entry of invisible gases and microscopic particles, but only
if harm

results”). Accordingly, we decline plaintiffs’ invitation to
strip the tort of trespass to land of its distinctive accouterments and
commingle its

identity with other causes of action.

As stated above, the traditional view of trespass required a
direct entry onto the land by a tangible object. However, recent trends have
led to

an erosion of these requirements. Some courts have
eliminated the requirement of a direct entry onto the land. E.g., Bradley v.
American

Smelting & Refining Co., 709 P.2d 782, 787–88 (Wash.
1985); Borland v. Sanders Lead Co., Inc., 369 So.2d 523, 527 (Ala. 1979);
Martin, supra

at 797 (observing the trend without deciding whether to join
it), citing

#955

Prosser, Torts (2d ed.), p. 56; 1 Restatement, Torts, § 158,
comment h. Some courts have likewise eliminated the requirement of a tangible
object.

E.g., Bradley, supra at 787–88; Borland, supra at 529. See
also Martin, supra at 797 (trespass to land may be accomplished by “a ray of
light, by

an atomic particle, or by a particulate of fluoride”). In
some cases the direct-and-tangible inquiry has been supplanted by an inquiry
into the force

and energy of the intruding agent. E.g., Bradley, supra at
788; Borland, supra at 527; Martin, supra at 793–94.

The courts that have deviated from the traditional
requirements of trespass, however, have consequently found troublesome the
traditional

principle that at least nominal damages are presumed in
cases of trespass. Thus, under the so-called modern view of trespass, in order
to avoid

subjecting manufacturing plants to potential liability to
every landowner on whose parcel some incidental residue of industrial activity
might

come to rest, these courts have grafted onto the law of
trespass a requirement of actual and substantial damages. Bradley, supra at
791; Borland,

supra at 529. See also Martin, supra at 795 (observing that
“[t]here are adjudicated cases which have refused to find a trespass where the

intrusion is clearly established but where the court has
felt that the possessor’s interest should not be protected”). Logically
following from a

requirement of substantial damages is the weighing of those
damages against the social utility of the activity causing them. Martin, supra
at 795

(balancing “the intrusion... against the socially desirable
conduct of the defendant”). See also Bradley, supra at 787 (“While the strict
liability

origins of trespass encourage courts to eschew a balancing
test in name, there is authority for denying injunctive relief if defendant has
exhausted

his technological opportunities for control....
Acknowledging technological or economic justifications for trespassory
invasions does away with

the historically harsh treatment of conduct interfering with
another’s possessory interests.”).^11

We do not welcome this redirection of trespass law toward
nuisance law. The requirement that real and substantial damages be proved, and

balanced against the usefulness of the offending activity,
is appropriate where the issue is interference with one’s use or enjoyment of
one’s land;

applying it where a landowner has had to endure an
unauthorized physical occupation of the landowner’s land, however, offends
traditional

principles of ownership. The law should not require a
property owner to justify exercising the right to exclude. To countenance the
erosion of

presumed damages in cases of trespass is to endanger the
right of exclusion itself.

To summarize, the effects of recent trends in the law of
trespass have included eliminating the requirements of a direct invasion by a

tangible

#956

object, requiring proof of actual and substantial damages,
and weighing the plaintiff’s damages against the social utility of the
operation causing

them. This so-called “modern view of trespass” appears, with
all its nuances and add-ons, merely to replicate traditional nuisance doctrine
as

recognized in Michigan. Indeed, the trends recognized or
advanced by Bradley, Borland, Martin, and their kindred spirits have conflated

nuisance with trespass to the point of rendering it
difficult to delineate the difference between the two theories of recovery.

* * * We prefer to preserve the separate identities of
      trespass and nuisance. * * *

III.Holding

Recovery for trespass to land in Michigan is available only
upon proof of an unauthorized direct or immediate intrusion of a physical,

tangible object onto land over which the plaintiff has a
right of exclusive possession. Once such an intrusion is proved, the tort has
been

established, and the plaintiff is presumptively entitled to
at least nominal damages. Where the possessor of land is menaced by noise,
vibrations,

or ambient dust, smoke, soot, or fumes, the possessory
interest implicated is that of use and enjoyment, not exclusion, and the
vehicle through

which a plaintiff normally should seek a remedy is the
doctrine of nuisance. To prevail in nuisance, a possessor of land must prove
significant

harm resulting from the defendant’s unreasonable
interference with the use or enjoyment of the property. Cloverleaf Car Co. v.
Phillips

Petroleum Co., 540 N.W.2d 297, 301–02 (Mich.App. 1995),
citing Adkins, supra at 720. Thus, in nuisance, the plaintiff must prove all
damages,

which may be awarded only to the extent that the defendant’s
conduct was “unreasonable” according to a public-policy assessment of its
overall

value. In the present case, because the intrusions of which
plaintiffs complained were intangible things, the trial court erred in allowing
the jury

to award damages in trespass. Instead, any award of damages
would have had to proceed from plaintiffs’ alternative but (as yet)
unsuccessful

theory of nuisance. * * *

The trial court’s instruction regarding trespass, as set
forth above, recognized a right to recover in trespass “if any damages were
caused by

the trespass” and that the agents potentially causing the
damages included “emissions, dust, vibration, noise.” Thus the trial court
seems to have

mirrored (and indeed gone beyond) the so-called modern view
of trespass according to which intangible irritants could constitute trespass.
This

instruction thus erroneously conflated trespass with
nuisance and produced the anomalous result that the jury failed to reach
agreement on the

nuisance claim while awarding damages for intrusions of
intangible things pursuant to the trespass claim.

#957

A.Tangible

Because noise or vibrations are clearly not tangible
objects, we hold that they cannot give rise to an action in trespass in this
state.^12 We

further hold that dust must generally be considered
intangible and thus not actionable in trespass.

We realize, of course, that dust particles are tangible
objects in a strict sense that they can be touched and are comprised of
physical

elements. However, we agree with those authorities that have
recognized, for practical purposes, that dust, along with other forms of
airborne

particulate, does not normally present itself as a
significant physical intrusion. See anno: Recovery in trespass for injury to
land caused by

airborne pollutants, 2 A.L.R.4th 1054, 1055
(“[t]raditionally, an invasion of the exclusive possession of land by
intangible substances, such as an

airborne pollutant, was usually held by the court not to
constitute a trespass”); Williams, supra, 659 N.E.2d at 382 n.2 (observing that
some

courts have held that a “ ‘tangible invasion’ or ‘object’ ”
must be “more substantial than dust, gas, or fumes”), citing Bradley, supra at
787.

Dust particles do not normally occupy the land on which they
settle in any meaningful sense; instead they simply become a part of the

ambient circumstances of that space. If the quantity and
character of the dust are such as to disturb the ambiance in ways that
interfere

substantially with the plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the
land, then recovery in nuisance is possible.

B.Direct

“[S]ome courts have held that if an intervening force, such
as wind or water, carries pollutants onto the plaintiff’s land, then the entry
is not

‘direct.’ ” Williams, supra at 382, n. 2, citing Bradley,
supra at 787. However, in order to avoid harsh results most courts have avoided
an overly

strict distinction between direct and indirect invasions,
see Prosser & Keeton, supra at § 13, pp. 68–69. Still, “[t]he
differentiation between direct

and indirect results may not be absolutely dead.” Id. at 71.

* * * We hold that the direct invasion requirement for an
      action in trespass to land is still alive in Michigan. The question then
      becomes,

how strong must the connection between cause and effect be
in order to satisfy this requirement?

We agree with the Restatement view that “[i]t is enough that
an act is done with knowledge that it will to a substantial certainty result in
the

entry of the foreign matter.” 1 Restatement Torts, 2d, §
158, comment i,

#958

p. 279. Thus, a “direct or immediate” invasion for purposes
of trespass is one that is accomplished by any means that the offender knew or

reasonably should have known would result in the physical
invasion of the plaintiff’s land.^15

C.Damages

* * * The trial court told the jury that “trespass... gives
      rise to a right to recover damages for the trespass, if any damages were caused
      by

the trespass.” This instruction would be appropriate for
nuisance, or negligence, under which theories the plaintiff must prove all
damages, but

not for trespass. A jury instruction with respect to the
latter should announce that because the violation of the right to exclude
causes cognizable

injury in and of itself, a plaintiff proving that violation
is presumptively entitled to at least nominal damages. The jury should be
further

instructed that beyond the presumed damages, the plaintiff
may recover any additional, actual damages proved.

* * * We hold that recovery in trespass is appropriate for
      any appreciable intrusion onto land in violation of the plaintiff’s right to
      exclude,

while recovery in nuisance is appropriate for only
substantial and unreasonable interference with the plaintiff’s right to quiet
enjoyment.

IV.Conclusion

There is no need to reformulate the traditional law of
trespass to accommodate the problems of airborne pollution, noise, or
vibrations,

because the doctrines of nuisance and related causes of
action have always stood ready to provide remedies. Trespass in Michigan
remains a

distinct doctrine providing a remedy for violation of a
distinct property right. A possessor of land proving a direct or immediate
intrusion of a

physical, tangible object onto the land is presumptively
entitled to recover at least nominal damages even absent any proof of actual
injury and

may recover additional damages for any injuries actually
proved. * * *

Reversed and remanded. We do not retain jurisdiction.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

```



1 .At various times four tests have, singly or in
combination, been used to demarcate the boundary of trespass and nuisance: ( 1
) whether the



```

```



959



```

defendant’s action giving rise to the intrusion was
committed on the plaintiff’s land or outside the plaintiff’s land; ( 2 )
whether the harm to the plaintiff’s

land was direct or indirect; ( 3 ) whether the invasion was
committed by tangible matter or by some intangible substance; and ( 4 ) whether
the intrusion

deprives the plaintiff of possession of the land, or merely
of use and enjoyment of the land. See generally Thomas W. Merrill, Trespass,
Nuisance, and

the Costs of Determining Property Rights, 14 J. Legal Stud.
13 , 26 – 35 ( 1985 ). Does the _Adams_ court provide a helpful synthesis by
holding that trespass

requires an intrusion that is both “tangible” and “direct”?
Would it be more straightforward simply to ask whether the intrusion displaces
the plaintiff

from possession of some portion of her land?

2 .Although the _Adams_ court was not willing to conflate
trespass and nuisance, some jurisdictions would allow trespass to apply to what
would

traditionally be treated as very serious nuisances. One
court has justified this move by observing that “the now famous equation E =
mc^2 has taught us

that mass and energy are equivalents and that our concept of
‘things’ must be reframed.” See Martin v. Reynolds Metals Co., 342 P. 2 d 790 ,
793 (Or.

1959 ). Do you agree that relativity theory renders the
traditional distinction between trespass and nuisance obsolete? The cases
propounding what the

_Adams_ court calls the “modern view of trespass” may have
been motivated less by the discoveries of modern physics than by sympathy for
particular

plaintiffs whose actions would be barred by the
comparatively short statutes of limitations that generally apply to nuisance as
opposed to trespass. See

Martin v. Reynolds Metals Co., supra (plaintiff’s claim
barred by statute of limitations if characterized as a nuisance, but not if
regarded as a trespass);

Borland v. Sanders Lead Co., 369 So. 2 d 523 (Ala. 1979 )
(same). Why do you suppose trespass has a relatively long statute of
limitations as compared to

nuisance?

3 .As noted by the court in _Adams_ , courts adopting the
“modern” view do not follow the simple, strict liability approach to
traditionally

“nontangible” invasions. For example, would the entry by a
single particle not visible to the naked eye count as a trespass? Should
repeated invasion by

nonvisible and otherwise harmless particles give rise to an
injunction? One court, in deferring the question of which approach to take to
trespass made

the following observation:

```



We recognize that the dispersion of airborne particles,
whatever their nature, may technically be considered an entry onto land
creating



liability for trespass irrespective of whether any damage
was caused. Because the ambient environment always contains particulate matter



from many sources, such a technical reading of trespass
would subject countless persons and entities to automatic liability for
trespass absent



any demonstrated injury. Plainly, that cannot be the
law—and, as far as we can tell, no jurisdiction has so held.



```

John Larkin, Inc. v. Marceau, 959 A. 2 d 551 , 555 (Vt. 2008
).

```



960



```

4 .How do we tell whether an intrusion is “substantial”? The
_Adams_ court states that a need to balance the plaintiff’s damages against the
social

utility of the defendant’s activity “[l]ogically follow[s]”
from the requirement of substantial damages. Do you agree? Is the court
claiming that we can

only know if damages are substantial if they outweigh the
utility of the conduct that produces them? Would physical damage to the land
ever be

considered anything other than substantial? What if a plant
producing a desperately needed drug moves next door to a modest residential
community and

causes deafening noise day and night? Is that substantial
injury? Is the substantiality of the harm a question of fact? Despite the
court’s pronouncement,

courts have taken a variety of approaches to figuring out
what is substantial damage.

5 .When should a “noninvasive” nuisance be actionable? Was
the intrusion in _Hendricks v. Stalnaker_ , excerpted in Chapter I,
noninvasive? Many

cases involve aesthetic blight along with noises and odors,
but getting a court to recognize a purely aesthetic nuisance was once next to
impossible and is

still very difficult. Compare Foley v. Harris, 286 S.E. 2 d
186 (Va. 1982 ) (upholding injunction against storage of wrecked cars); Allison
v. Smith, 695

P. 2 d 791 (Colo. Ct. App. 1984 ) (nuisance from storage of
disused cars and other junk) with Carroll v. Hurst, 431 N.E. 2 d 1344 , 1349
(Ill. App. Ct. 1982 )

(rejecting junkyard and salvage operation as nuisance
because “under Illinois law, a landowner does not have a right to a pleasing
view of his neighbor’s

land”); Ness v. Albert, 665 S.W. 2 d 1 , 2 (Mo. Ct. App.
1983 ) (holding junk not to be a nuisance because aesthetic considerations are
subjective);

Mathewson v. Primeau, 395 P. 2 d 183 (Wash. 1964 )
(upholding injunction for odors from hog raising operation but not for
aesthetic harm from a pile of

junk); see generally Prosser and Keeton on Torts § 87 , at
626. Nor have courts been receptive to claims of nuisance based on the identity
of a land user.

See Rachel D. Godsil, Race Nuisance: The Politics of Law in
the Jim Crow Era, 105 Mich. L. Rev. 505 , 516 ( 2006 ) (showing that courts
even in the Jim

Crow South routinely denied nuisance claims based on race of
occupants of neighboring parcels, in contrast to their enforcement of racially
restrictive

covenants); see also Taja-Nia Y. Henderson & Jamila
Jefferson-Jones, #LivingWhileBlack: Blackness as Nuisance, 69 Am. U.L. Rev. 863
, 898 ( 2020 )

(noting that despite this history, “ideas about racial
inferiority feature prominently” in the decisions denying nuisance relief). In
contrast, courts have

been relatively receptive to noninvasive nuisance claims
based on the depressing effect of funeral homes and graveyards. Does this make
sense?

Some commentators have urged a more expansive use of
nuisance for noninvasive harms, on the ground that these harms are no less real
than those

flowing from noises and odors. See, e.g., John Copeland
Nagle, Moral Nuisances, 50 Emory L.J. 265 ( 2001 ); George P. Smith &
Griffin W. Fernandez,

The Price of Beauty: An Economic Approach to Aesthetic
Nuisance, 15 Harv. Envtl. L. Rev. 53 , 53 ( 1991 ). Others would hew closer to
the traditional

invasion test, at least presumptively. See, e.g., Eric R.
Claeys, Jefferson Meets Coase: Land-Use Torts, Law and Economics, and Natural
Property

Rights, 85 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1379 ( 2010 ); Richard A.
Epstein,

Smith, Exclusion and Property Rules in the Law of Nuisance, 90 Va. L. Rev. 965
( 2004 ).

Consider, in this regard, Mark v. State Department of Fish
and Wildlife, 974 P. 2 d 716 (Or. App. 1999 ), in which the appeals court held
the plaintiff

stated a cause of action in private and public nuisance
against a state agency for failing to prevent public nudity in an adjacent
wildlife area. Interestingly

the court employed the term “invasive nudity” despite the
fact that the nudists did not actually enter onto the plaintiff’s land. Rather,
what counted was

the unavoidability of seeing the “full adult nudity” and
“repeated acts of depravity, illegality and lewdness.” Id. at 718. What are the
grounds for

considering naked adults a nuisance, but not junked cars?

6 .All the foregoing questions about tangibility,
substantiality, and aesthetics have been raised more recently by groups
projecting messages with

light onto buildings. Sometimes, the purpose is to protest,
as when artist Robin Bell projected “Emoluments Welcome” over the doors of
then-President

Donald Trump’s D.C. hotel, or when pro-life groups projected
graphic images onto Planned Parenthood facilities and a nativity scene on an
American

Civil Liberties Union building. But light messages have also
been projected as “guerrilla” advertising, for instance, when T-Mobile
projected its logo

and quips about service quality onto the side of Comcast’s
headquarters. See Maureen E. Brady, Property and Projection, 133 Harv. L. Rev.
1143 , 1145

( 2020 ). Only a few courts have considered whether or how
the property torts apply to this conduct. Compare International Union of
Painters & Allied

Trades District Council 15 Local 159 v. Great Wash Park,
LLC, No. 67453 , 2016 WL 4499940 (Nev. Ct. App. Aug. 18 , 2016 ) (deciding the
plaintiff

would fail under either traditional or modern theory of
trespass because light is intangible and caused no damage); id. at * 8 (Tao,
J., concurring)

(expressing the view that nuisance’s “balancing of competing
interests” should permit examination of whether the “intensity, duration, or
other qualities

of the projection were unreasonable or excessive”); Urban

Should light projections be considered as trespasses,

meaningfully different

from other forms of intangible invasions?

Natural Intrusions

How should courts treat intrusions from neighboring property
that deprive the plaintiff of some portion of his column of space but are

attributable to forces of nature rather than intentional
human conduct? The classic problem involves trees planted on the defendant’s
land that,

over time, grow branches or roots that enter the plaintiff’s
column of space. The traditional common law rule here treats the intruding tree
as a

trespass, but limits the plaintiff to self-help in
remediating the trespass. Thus, the plaintiff can cut off the intruding limb or
root, but cannot force

the defendant to perform tree surgery, or extract a payment
of damages from the defendant for any injury or harm caused by the intrusion.
W.

Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts § 57, at 391
(5th ed. 1984); Daniel J. Wisniewski, Vegetation as a Nuisance, 8 J.L. Econ.
& Pol’y

931 (2012). Can you articulate a possible rationale or
rationales for this unusual rule? Does limiting the plaintiff to self-help in
this context

promote neighborly accommodation, or foment discord? Should
there be an exception if the defendant deliberately plants a fast-growing tree

next to the property line in order to harass the plaintiff?
What if cutting off the limb or roots causes the tree to die?

Recently, the Virginia Supreme Court departed from the
common law approach by holding that intrusions of tree roots, at least in a

suburban setting, should be governed by the law of nuisance.
Fancher v.

#963

Fagella, 650 S.E.2d 519 (Va. 2007). Thus, intruding tree
roots and limbs can give rise to liability if they “cause actual harm” and are

“unreasonable,” taking into account the nature of the
locality, and both damages and injunctive relief against the owner of the tree
are potentially

available. Limiting the scope of nuisance the court held
that “ ‘encroaching trees and plants are not nuisances merely because they cast
shade,

drop leaves, flowers, or fruit, or just because they happen
to encroach upon adjoining property either above or below the ground.’ ” Id. at
555–56

(quoting Lane v. W.J. Curry & Sons, 92 S.W.3d 355, 364
(Tenn. 2002)). Does shifting from trespass (limited to self-help) to nuisance
in this

context provide a better prospect of promoting neighborly
accommodation? Or is it likely to produce a lot of vexatious litigation when
neighbors

have different preferences about vegetation? Some states
relegate the intruded upon landowner to self-help, but allow an action in cases
of actual

or imminent harm from the offending tree. Another, less
common, approach is to limit actionability to “noxious” or “artificial”
vegetation.

Should access to tort law turn on evaluation of these
variables? Don’t forget that the law of negligence may apply to trees as well.

Another issue involving intrusions of nature concerns water.
It is clear that when a defendant interferes with the natural flow of a

watercourse, for example by building a dam, and this causes
the plaintiff’s land to be inundated by water, this deprivation of possession
can be

regarded as a trespass. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §
158 cmt. i , illus. 5. Yet, for a variety of reasons, flooding another’s land
has always

fallen in an ambiguous territory between trespass, nuisance,
and strict liability. Dan B. Dobbs, The Law of Torts 106 (2000). In the famous
case

of Rylands v. Fletcher , (1868) 3 L.R.E. & I. App. 330,
339–40 (H.L.), the English House of Lords held the defendant strictly liable
for flooding

caused by seepage of water from a holding pond into an
abandoned mining shaft, which then burst into the plaintiff’s mine. But the
court limited

its holding by characterizing the pond as a “non-natural”
use of the land. The notion seems to be that flooding will lead to more
automatic

liability when caused by some human manipulation of
property. American courts are divided about the rule in Rylands. Dobbs, supra §
347, at

On the other hand, if property is inundated by a natural
flood, courts have traditionally allowed landowners to exercise self-help to
protect

themselves from the waters, even if this results in more
water inundating a neighbor’s land. This is the so-called “common enemy”
doctrine,

briefly noted in Chapter III. The common enemy doctrine
obviously bears some resemblance to the common law treatment of tree limbs and

roots. Again, some courts have begun to question the
doctrine, and have started to apply more nuisance-like regimes in assessing
landowner

behavior in the face of flooding caused by forces of nature.
Smith, supra, 90 Va. L. Rev. at 1017–18.

### 3 .PROPERTY RULES, LIABILITY RULES, AND REMEDIES

Nuisance disputes raise squarely the question of whether to
enjoin the offending activity or to require the one committing the nuisance to

pay damages, or some combination of both. The question
whether courts should issue injunctions or award damages for violations of
property

rights is often discussed in the scholarly literature in
terms of the distinction between “property rules” and “liability rules.” Credit
for this

distinction goes to Guido Calabresi, one of the early
pioneers of law and economics who went on to become Dean of the Yale School and
then a

judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
and one of his Harvard Law School students, Douglas Melamed. As we shall see,

property rules do not always equate with injunctions and
damages do not always implement a liability rule. Nevertheless, property rights
are

strongly associated with “property rule” protection, while
contract rights and many rights protected by tort law are more closely
associated with

“liability rule” protection. In the hands of Calabresi and
Melamed, however, all types of entitlements were merged together, and analyzed
in

terms of the degree of protection provided against takings
by third parties or the state.

```

* * * The first issue which must be faced by any legal
      system is one we call the problem of “entitlement.” Whenever a state is
      presented

with the conflicting interests of two or more people, or two
or more groups of people, it must decide which side to favor. Absent such a
decision,

access to goods, services, and life itself will be decided
on the basis of “might makes right”—whoever is stronger or shrewder will win.
Hence

the fundamental thing that law does is to decide which of
the conflicting parties will be entitled to prevail. The entitlement to make
noise versus

the entitlement to have silence, the entitlement to pollute
versus the entitlement to breathe clean air, the entitlement to have children
versus the

entitlement to forbid them—these are the first order of
legal decisions. * * *

The state not only has to decide whom to entitle, but it
must also simultaneously make a series of equally difficult second order
decisions.

These decisions go to the manner in which entitlements are
protected and to whether an individual is allowed to sell or trade the
entitlement. In

any given dispute, for example, the state must decide not
only which side wins but also the kind of protection to grant. * * * We shall
consider

three types of entitlements—entitlements protected by
property rules, entitlements protected by liability rules, and inalienable
entitlements. * * *

#965

An entitlement is protected by a property rule to the extent
that someone who wishes to remove the entitlement from its holder must buy it

from him in a voluntary transaction in which the value of
the entitlement is agreed upon by the seller. It is the form of entitlement
which gives

rise to the least amount of state intervention: once the
original entitlement is decided upon, the state does not try to decide its
value. It lets each of

the parties say how much the entitlement is worth to him,
and gives the seller a veto if the buyer does not offer enough. Property rules
involve a

collective decision as to who is to be given an initial
entitlement but not as to the value of the entitlement.

Whenever someone may destroy the initial entitlement if he
is willing to pay an objectively determined value for it, an entitlement is

protected by a liability rule. This value may be what it is
thought the original holder of the entitlement would have sold it for. But the
holder’s

complaint that he would have demanded more will not avail
him once the objectively determined value is set. Obviously, liability rules
involve

an additional stage of state intervention: not only are
entitlements protected, but their transfer or destruction is allowed on the
basis of a value

determined by some organ of the state rather than by the
parties themselves.

An entitlement is inalienable to the extent that its
transfer is not permitted between a willing buyer and a willing seller. The
state intervenes

not only to determine who is initially entitled and to
determine the compensation that must be paid if the entitlement is taken or
destroyed, but

also to forbid its sale under some or all circumstances.
Inalienability rules are thus quite different from property and liability
rules. Unlike those

rules, rules of inalienability not only “protect” the
entitlement; they may also be viewed as limiting or regulating the grant of the
entitlement

itself.

It should be clear that most entitlements to most goods are
mixed. Taney’s house may be protected by a property rule in situations where

Marshall wishes to purchase it, by a liability rule where
the government decides to take it by eminent domain, and by a rule of
inalienability in

situations where Taney is drunk or incompetent. * * *

NOTES

1 .Most of the scholarship that follows Calabresi and
Melamed has focused on the distinction between property rules and liability
rules and has

assumed that “property rule” protection means mandatory
relief (an injunction or no liability) and “liability rule” means payments of
monetary

compensation (usually from defendant to plaintiff but
occasionally the other way around). This is an oversimplification. An
entitlement is protected by a

“property rule” when it cannot be taken without the holder’s
consent. An entitlement is protected by a “liability rule” when it can be taken
by what

amounts to a forced sale—the holder of the entitlement has
no choice but to give it up in return for an award of monetary compensation.
When we find

```



966



```

that an entitlement is protected by a property rule, this
understanding can be enforced in a variety of ways designed to preserve the
principle that the

entitlement cannot be taken without the holder’s consent,
including throwing violators of entitlements in jail or privileging entitlement
holders to use

self-help to deter violators. Recall that one purpose of the
punitive damages award in _Jacque v. Steenberg Homes_ (in Chapter I) was to
make the point

that entities like Steenberg Homes cannot enter real
property without the owner’s consent. Thus, it is inaccurate to suggest, as
some of the literature

does, that the court’s decision to enter an injunction
somehow “creates” a property rule. An injunction is an in personam order that
binds a particular

party to desist from certain acts or to perform certain
acts. An injunction thus will often _reflect_ a judicial judgment that a
certain entitlement is entitled to

property rule protection. But the underlying understanding
of what it means to protect an entitlement with a “property rule” is grounded
in an anterior

understanding about the nature of the rights that persons in
the position of the entitlement holder have, and in particular in the
perception that all other

persons have a duty to respect these rights. Analogous
points can be made about entitlements protected by liability rules. In general,
whether a court

decides to enter an injunction or award damages is
_evidence_ of the court’s conception of the degree of protection the
entitlement should be given, but

these remedial orders do not themselves define the
appropriate degree of protection. See Jules L. Coleman & Jody Kraus,
Rethinking the Theory of

Legal Rights, 95 Yale L.J. 1335 , 1345 ( 1986 ); Dale A.
Nance, Guidance Rules and Enforcement Rules: A Better View of the Cathedral, 83
Va. L. Rev.

837 ( 1997 ); see also John C. Harrison, Immunity Rules, in
The Legacy of Wesley Hohfeld: Edited Major Works, Select Personal Papers, and
Original

Commentaries (Shyam Balganesh, Ted Sichelman & Henry
Smith eds., forthcoming), https://ssrn. com/ abstract = 2918975 (arguing that
the Calabresi and

Melamed framework wrongly conflates accidents and takings);
Troy A. Rule, Entitlement-Shifting Rules, 62 B.C. L. Rev. 1193 ( 2021 )
(analyzing and

critiquing devices like proposed drone regulations as
“entitlement-shifting” rules).

2 .The common starting point in the literature discussing
property rules and liability rules is that courts have a “choice” along two
dimensions.

First, they can choose to assign the entitlement to either
the plaintiff or the defendant. Second, they can choose to protect this
entitlement with either a

property rule or a liability rule. This yields four “rules,”
conventionally diagrammed as follows:

```



967



```

Figure 9-2

Calabresi & Melamed box

The stock example used to illustrate these four
possibilities is a nuisance dispute like the ones in _Jost v. Dairyland Power
Cooperative_ and

_Campbell v. Seaman_ where the defendant is engaged in some
polluting activity and the plaintiff is a nearby farmer or resident who
objects. One possible

choice the court can make (Rule 1 ) is to award the
entitlement to the plaintiff and to protect this by a property rule. This means
(among other things) that

the plaintiff can insist on an injunction forcing the
defendant to abate the nuisance, or if this is not possible, to stop the
nuisance-generating activity.

_Campbell_ is an example, because the plaintiff obtained an
injunction.

A second choice (Rule 2 ) is again to award the entitlement
to the plaintiff, but this time to protect the entitlement with a liability
rule. This means

the defendant can take the plaintiff’s entitlement without
the plaintiff’s consent, typically upon payment of court-determined damages,
which here would

probably be the diminished market value of the land subject
to the nuisance. _Jost_ is an example of Rule 2. The famous case of _Boomer v.
Atlantic

Cement_ , 257 N.E. 2 d 870 (N.Y. 1970 ), a staple of torts
courses, is another example of Rule 2. In that case, plaintiffs sued the
defendant in nuisance for

dirt, smoke, and vibrations caused by their cement plant
near Albany, New York. At trial, a nuisance was found, but the court awarded
temporary

damages (compensating for the harm that had already
occurred) as opposed to an injunction. On appeal, the New York Court of Appeals
changed the

remedy, awarding the plaintiffs an injunction that could be
vacated upon the payment of permanent damages: the net present value of all
future damages

suffered by the plaintiffs. In other words, although the
plaintiffs were awarded the entitlement, the cement plant could continue
operating by paying.

_Boomer_ became a famous case, in part because when it was
decided the then-nascent law-and-economics movement was concerned with problems
of

high transaction costs and holdouts when the number of
affected parties is large. A conflict between a single polluter and multiple
residents was the

archetypal example of a high-transaction-cost

```



968



```

dispute in this literature. Most commentators came to agree
that in such a situation, damages (liability rules) are preferable to
injunctions (property

rules). The facts and the remedial outcome in _Boomer_
seemed to confirm this analysis. See, e.g., A. Mitchell Polinsky, Resolving
Nuisance Disputes:

The Simple Economics of Injunctive and Damage Remedies, 32
Stan. L. Rev. 1075 , 1076 ( 1980 ). More recently, some have begun to voice
doubts. See,

e.g., Daniel A. Farber, Reassessing _Boomer_ : Justice,
Efficiency, and Nuisance Law, in Property Law and Legal Education: Essays in
Honor of John E.

Cribbet 7 , 8 – 9 (Peter Hay & Michael H. Hoeflich eds.,
1988 ); Smith, supra, 90 Va. L. Rev. at 1037 – 45.

A third possibility (Rule 3 ) would be to award the
entitlement to the defendant protected by a property rule. This means the
offensive activity can

continue, and the plaintiff can get it abated or removed
only by getting the _defendant’s_ consent. Airplane overflight cases (such as
_Hinman v. Pacific Air

Transport_ in Chapter I) might be considered Rule 3
decisions: The court holds airline companies have the entitlement to use the
airspace at cruising

altitudes, meaning the surface owner would have to get their
consent to stop them from using it. Or _Tucker v. Mack Paving Co._ , cited in
Note 1 after

_Campbell_ , by refusing to find the defendant liable, might
be thought to create a de facto “entitlement” to pollute. (Or does it? We
return to this issue at

the end of this Section.)

Finally, a fourth possibility (Rule 4 ) is that the
entitlement is awarded to the defendant, but the plaintiff can force the
defendant to transfer the

entitlement to the plaintiff in return for a payment of
money compensation. We will encounter this possibility in the next case in this
Section, _Spur

Industries, Inc. v. Del E. Webb Development Co._ , where the
court held that the plaintiff can force the defendant to stop committing a
nuisance but only

upon paying compensation to the defendant for the cost that
this would entail.

3 .In discussing how to assign the initial entitlement, and
the choice of whether to protect that entitlement with a property rule or a
liability rule,

Calabresi and Melamed addressed three factors: “economic
efficiency,” “distributional preferences,” and “other justice considerations.”
Subsequent

commentators have tended to collapse the three factors into
two: efficiency and distributive justice. Although this simplifies
(oversimplifies?) matters,

the decisional calculus is still quite complex. We will
offer only a flavor of the type of discussion found in the literature.

4 .Much of the literature, building on Ronald Coase (Chapter
I), focuses on transaction costs. The central insight is that when transaction
costs are

low, thereby making consensual exchange of entitlements a
realistic possibility, courts should prefer property rule protection (Rules 1
and 3 ). This is

because efficiency concerns can be satisfied by the
possibility of exchange. If the plaintiff values the entitlement more than the
defendant, the plaintiff

will end up with the entitlement: Either the plaintiff will
refuse to sell to the defendant (under Rule 1 ) or the plaintiff will buy the
entitlement from the

defendant (under Rule 3 ). Conversely, if the defendant
values the entitlement more than the plaintiff, then the defendant will end up
with the entitlement:

Either the defendant will buy the entitlement from

```



969



```

the plaintiff (under Rule 1 ) or the defendant will refuse
to sell to the plaintiff (under Rule 3 ). Either way, the entitlement ends up
in the hands of the

party who values it the most, in terms of being willing to
pay the most for it. And the parties themselves will have made the valuation of
the entitlement,

ensuring that no subjective or idiosyncratic values have
been overlooked by the court. Thus, the court can concentrate on distributional
concerns or other

justice factors. If these non-efficiency factors favor the
plaintiff, use Rule 1. Under this rule, any post-decisional flow of funds will
go to the plaintiff. If

the non-efficiency factors favor the defendant, use Rule 3.
Any post-decisional flow of funds will then go to the defendant. Recently some
scholars have

argued that various more complicated liability rules can be
tailored to solve these other problems, and controversy continues over the
relative advantages

of liability rules and property rules in the low transaction
cost setting. See Note 7 infra.

5 .Things get a good deal more complicated when transaction
costs are high. Here, a variety of arguments about the relative merits of
property

rules and liability rules have been advanced, but one point
of consensus is that when transaction costs are high there may be circumstances
in which

shifting to liability rules is preferred, at least on
efficiency grounds. One argument, which originated with Calabresi and Melamed
themselves, focuses

on problems involving large numbers of parties on one side
or another of a dispute. See 85 Harv. L. Rev. at 1106 – 08. Consider property
rules. If the

numerous side wants to buy out the singular side, it will be
frustrated by free-rider problems, and if the singular side wishes to buy off
the numerous

side, there will tend to be hold-outs. Liability rules
appear to cut through these problems, although they do present problems of
their own, if plaintiffs

have to organize to sue. Further, the process of assessing
damages can be fraught with the same problems that would be encountered in
trying to

negotiate the buyout of an entitlement. Damages must be
calculated by the court, and if they vary from person to person or are
difficult to measure, the

assessment process may also encounter analogous difficulties
that render the apparent advantage of liability rules illusory. See James E.
Krier & Stewart

J. Schwab, Property Rules and Liability Rules: The Cathedral
in Another Light, 70 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 440 , 453 – 64 ( 1995 ).

6 .Another argument for liability rules under conditions of
high transaction costs posits that courts may have more limited information
than the

parties about the benefits and costs of allocating
entitlements. See, e.g., Polinsky, supra. Suppose, for example, that the court
has good information about

the plaintiff’s damages, but poor information about the
defendant’s costs of eliminating the harm. The court is reasonably certain that
the plaintiff’s

damages are $ 5 , 000 , based on testimony about the value
of the property before and after the nuisance arose. But the defendant claims
that abating the

nuisance will require new equipment, at a cost of tens of
thousands of dollars (or even shutting down a plant, wasting a large investment
and destroying

jobs). The court suspects that the defendant is bluffing,
and that the actual cost of eliminating the nuisance may be much less. In these
circumstances, the

argument goes, the court can adopt Rule 2 , in effect giving
the defendant the option of paying the plaintiff’s damages

```



970



```

($ 5 , 000 ) or eliminating the nuisance. Now the defendant
no longer has any incentive to bluff. If she can figure out a way of
eliminating the nuisance for

less than $ 5 , 000 , she will do so. If not, she will pay
the plaintiff $ 5 , 000. The result will be efficient, in the sense that the
defendant will choose the

lowest-cost solution for eliminating the plaintiff’s injury,
without any need for the court to dictate the solution or the parties to engage
in exchanges of

entitlements.

7 .The literature on property rules and liability rules is
vast. For an overview, see Carol M. Rose, The Shadow of the Cathedral, 106 Yale
L.J. 2175

( 1996 ). The Krier and Schwab article cited above provides
a particularly clear summary of the principal developments in the literature.
See also, e.g.,

Ian Ayres, Optional Law: The Structure of Legal Entitlements
( 2005 ) (arguing for general superiority of various liability rules); Keith N.
Hylton,

Property Rules and Defensive Conduct in Tort Law, 4 J. Tort
L. 1 ( 2011 ) (justifying property rules as obviating defensive conduct); Louis
Kaplow &

Steven Shavell, Property Rules Versus Liability Rules: An
Economic Analysis, 109 Harv. L. Rev. 713 ( 1996 ) (arguing that liability rules
are better when

the parties assert incompatible demands on a resource, but
property rules are better when the parties seek to make the same use of a
resource); Henry E.

Smith, Property and Property Rules, 79 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1719 (
2004 ) (defending widespread use of property rules based on information costs).
Recently

commentators have sought to extend the Calabresi and Melamed
framework with insights from organization theory and psychology. See, e.g.
Gregg P.

Macey, Coasean Blind Spots: Charting the Incomplete
Institutionalism, 98 Geo. L.J. 863 ( 2010 ); Jonathan Remy Nash & Stephanie
M. Stern, Property

Frames, 87 Wash. U. L. Rev. 449 ( 2010 ).

8 .Calabresi and Melamed also have interesting things to say
about inalienability rules, which prohibit the transfer of entitlements from
the original

holder. Inalienability rules usually apply to persons (e.g.,
you cannot sell yourself into slavery), body parts (e.g., sales of organs and
tissue are either

prohibited or tightly regulated), cultural patrimony (e.g.,
you cannot sell certain kinds of Native American cultural artifacts), and so
forth.

#### Spur Industries, Inc. v. Del E. Webb Development Co.

```



Supreme Court of Arizona, 1972.



494 P. 2 d 700.



```

■
CAMERON, VICE CHIEF JUSTICE. From a judgment permanently enjoining the
defendant, Spur Industries, Inc., from operating a cattle feedlot near

the plaintiff Del E. Webb Development Company’s Sun City,
Spur appeals. Webb cross-appeals. Although numerous issues are raised, we feel

that it is necessary to answer only two questions. They are:

1.Where the operation of a business, such as a cattle
feedlot is lawful in the first instance, but becomes a nuisance by reason of a
nearby

residential area, may the feedlot operation be enjoined in
an action brought by the developer of the residential area?

#971

2.Assuming that the nuisance may be enjoined, may the
developer of a completely new town or urban area in a previously agricultural
area

be required to indemnify the operator of the feedlot who
must move or cease operation because of the presence of the residential area
created by

the developer?

The facts necessary for a determination of this matter on
appeal are as follows. The area in question is located in Maricopa County,
Arizona,

some 14 to 15 miles west of the urban area of Phoenix, on
the Phoenix-Wickenburg Highway, also known as Grand Avenue. About two miles

south of Grand Avenue is Olive Avenue which runs east and
west. 11 1th Avenue runs north and south as does the Agua Fria River
immediately

to the west. See Exhibits A and B below.

Farming started in this area about 191 1. In 1929, with the
completion of the Carl Pleasant Dam, gravity flow water became available to the

property located to the west of the Agua Fria River, though
land to the east remained dependent upon well water for irrigation. By 1950,
the only

urban areas in the vicinity were the agriculturally related
communities of Peoria, El Mirage, and Surprise located along Grand Avenue.
Along

11 1th Avenue, approximately one mile south of Grand Avenue
and 1 1/2 miles north of Olive Avenue, the community of Youngtown was

commenced in 1954. Youngtown is a retirement community
appealing primarily to senior citizens.

In 195 6, Spur’s predecessors in interest, H. Marion Welborn
and the Northside Hay Mill and Trading Company, developed feed-lots, about

1/2 mile south of Olive Avenue, in an area between the
confluence of the usually dry Agua Fria and New Rivers. The area is well suited
for cattle

feeding and in 1959, there were 25 cattle feeding pens or
dairy operations within a 7 mile radius of the location developed by Spur’s

predecessors. In April and May of 1959, the Northside Hay
Mill was feeding between 6,000 and 7,000 head of cattle and Welborn
approximately

1,500 head on a combined area of 35 acres.

In May of 1 959, Del Webb began to plan the development of
an urban area to be known as Sun City. For this purpose, the Marinette and the

Santa Fe Ranches, some 20,000 acres of farmland, were
purchased for $15,000,000 or $750.00 per acre. This price was considerably less
than the

price of land located near the urban area of Phoenix, and
along with the success of Youngtown was a factor influencing the decision to
purchase

the property in question.

Figure 9-3

Exhibits A and B

By September 1959, Del Webb had started construction of a
golf course south of Grand Avenue and Spur’s predecessors had started to level

ground for more feedlot area. In 1960, Spur purchased the
property in question and began a rebuilding and expansion program extending
both to

the north and south of the original facilities. By 1962,
Spur’s expansion program was completed and had expanded from approximately 35
acres

to 114 acres. See Exhibit A[.]

Accompanied by an extensive advertising campaign, homes were
first offered by Del Webb in January 1960 and the first unit to be

completed was south of Grand Avenue and approximately 2 1/2
miles north of Spur. By 2 May 1960, there were 450 to 500 houses completed or

under construction. At this time, Del Webb did not consider
odors from the Spur feed pens a problem and Del Webb continued to develop in a

southerly direction, until sales resistance became so great
that the parcels were difficult if not impossible to sell. * * *

#973

By December 1967, Del Webb’s property had extended south to
Olive Avenue and Spur was within 500 feet of Olive Avenue to the north.

See Exhibit B above. Del Webb filed its original complaint
alleging that in excess of 1,300 lots in the southwest portion were unfit for

development for sale as residential lots because of the
operation of the Spur feedlot.

Del Webb’s suit complained that the Spur feeding operation
was a public nuisance because of the flies and the odor which were drifting or

being blown by the prevailing south to north wind over the
southern portion of Sun City. At the time of the suit, Spur was feeding between

20,000 and 30,000 head of cattle, and the facts amply
support the finding of the trial court that the feed pens had become a nuisance
to the people

who resided in the southern part of Del Webb’s development.
The testimony indicated that cattle in a commercial feedlot will produce 35 to
40

pounds of wet manure per day, per head, or over a million
pounds of wet manure per day for 30,000 head of cattle, and that despite the

admittedly good feedlot management and good housekeeping
practices by Spur, the resulting odor and flies produced an annoying if not

unhealthy situation as far as the senior citizens of
southern Sun City were concerned. There is no doubt that some of the citizens
of Sun City

were unable to enjoy the outdoor living which Del Webb had
advertised and that Del Webb was faced with sales resistance from prospective

purchasers as well as strong and persistent complaints from
the people who had purchased homes in that area. * * *

[N]either the citizens of Sun City nor Youngtown are
represented in this lawsuit and the suit is solely between Del E. Webb
Development

Company and Spur Industries, Inc.

MAY SPUR BE ENJOINED?

The difference between a private nuisance and a public
nuisance is generally one of degree. A private nuisance is one affecting a
single

individual or a definite small number of persons in the
enjoyment of private rights not common to the public, while a public nuisance
is one

affecting the rights enjoyed by citizens as a part of the
public. To constitute a public nuisance, the nuisance must affect a
considerable number of

people or an entire community or neighborhood. City of
Phoenix v. Johnson, 75 P.2d 30 (Ariz. 1938).

Where the injury is slight, the remedy for minor
inconveniences lies in an action for damages rather than in one for an
injunction. Kubby v.

Hammond, 198 P.2d 134 (Ariz. 1948). Moreover, some courts
have held, in the “balancing of conveniences” cases, that damages may be the
sole

remedy. See Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co., 257 N.E.2d 870
(N.Y. 1970), and annotation comments, 40 A.L.R.3d 601.

Thus, it would appear from the admittedly incomplete record
as developed in the trial court, that, at most, residents of Youngtown would be

entitled to damages rather than injunctive relief.

#974

We have no difficulty, however, in agreeing with the
conclusion of the trial court that Spur’s operation was an enjoinable public
nuisance as

far as the people in the southern portion of Del Webb’s Sun
City were concerned.

§ 36–601, subsec. A reads as follows:

§ 36–601. Public nuisances dangerous to public health

A.The following conditions are specifically declared public
nuisances dangerous to the public health:

1.Any condition or place in populous areas which constitutes
a breeding place for flies, rodents, mosquitoes and other insects

which are capable of carrying and transmitting
disease-causing organisms to any person or persons.

By this statute, before an otherwise lawful (and necessary)
business may be declared a public nuisance, there must be a “populous” area in

which people are injured:

[I]t hardly admits a doubt that, in determining the question
as to whether a lawful occupation is so conducted as to constitute a

nuisance as a matter of fact, the locality and surroundings
are of the first importance. A business which is not per se a public nuisance

may become such by being carried on at a place where the
health, comfort, or convenience of a populous neighborhood is affected.

* * * What might amount to a serious nuisance in one
      locality by reason of the density of the population, or character of the

neighborhood affected, may in another place and under
different surroundings be deemed proper and unobjectionable.

MacDonald v. Perry, 255 P. 494, 497 (Ariz. 1927).

It is clear that as to the citizens of Sun City, the
operation of Spur’s feedlot was both a public and a private nuisance. They
could have

successfully maintained an action to abate the nuisance. Del
Webb, having shown a special injury in the loss of sales, had a standing to
bring suit

to enjoin the nuisance. Engle v. Clark, 90 P.2d 994 (Ariz.
1939); City of Phoenix v. Johnson, supra. The judgment of the trial court
permanently

enjoining the operation of the feedlot is affirmed.

MUST DEL WEBB INDEMNIFY SPUR?

A suit to enjoin a nuisance sounds in equity and the courts
have long recognized a special responsibility to the public when acting as a
court

of equity:

§ 104.Where public interest is involved.

Courts of equity may, and frequently do, go much further
both to give and withhold relief in furtherance of the public interest than
they

are accustomed to go when only private interests are

#975

involved. Accordingly, the granting or withholding of relief
may properly be dependent upon considerations of public interest.

27 Am.Jur.2d, Equity, page 626.

In addition to protecting the public interest, however,
courts of equity are concerned with protecting the operator of a lawfully,
albeit

noxious, business from the result of a knowing and willful
encroachment by others near his business.

In the so-called “coming to the nuisance” cases, the courts
have held that the residential landowner may not have relief if he knowingly

came into a neighborhood reserved for industrial or
agricultural endeavors and has been damaged thereby * * *

Were Webb the only party injured, we would feel justified in
holding that the doctrine of “coming to the nuisance” would have been a bar to

the relief asked by Webb, and, on the other hand, had Spur
located the feedlot near the outskirts of a city and had the city grown toward
the

feedlot, Spur would have to suffer the cost of abating the
nuisance as to those people locating within the growth pattern of the expanding
city

---

We agree, however, with the Massachusetts court that:

The law of nuisance affords no rigid rule to be applied in
all instances. It is elastic. It undertakes to require only that which is fair
and

reasonable under all the circumstances. In a commonwealth
like this, which depends for its material prosperity so largely on the

continued growth and enlargement of manufacturing of diverse
varieties, “extreme rights” cannot be enforced.

Stevens v. Rockport Granite Co., 104 N.E. 371, 373 (Mass.
1914).

There was no indication in the instant case at the time Spur
and its predecessors located in western Maricopa County that a new city would

spring up, full-blown, alongside the feeding operation and
that the developer of that city would ask the court to order Spur to move
because of

the new city. Spur is required to move not because of any
wrongdoing on the part of Spur, but because of a proper and legitimate regard
of the

courts for the rights and interests of the public.

Del Webb, on the other hand, is entitled to the relief
prayed for (a permanent injunction), not because Webb is blameless, but because
of the

damage to the people who have been encouraged to purchase
homes in Sun City. It does not equitably or legally follow, however, that Webb,

being entitled to the injunction, is then free of any
liability to Spur if Webb has in fact been the cause of the damage Spur has
sustained. It does

not seem harsh to require a developer, who has taken
advantage of the lesser land values in a rural area as well as the availability
of large tracts of

land on which to build and develop a new town or city in the
area, to indemnify those who are forced to leave as a result.

#976

Having brought people to the nuisance to the foreseeable
detriment of Spur, Webb must indemnify Spur for a reasonable amount of the cost

of moving or shutting down. It should be noted that this
relief to Spur is limited to a case wherein a developer has, with
foreseeability, brought

into a previously agricultural or industrial area the
population which makes necessary the granting of an injunction against a lawful
business and

for which the business has no adequate relief.

It is therefore the decision of this court that the matter
be remanded to the trial court for a hearing upon the damages sustained by the

defendant Spur as a reasonable and direct result of the
granting of the permanent injunction. Since the result of the appeal may appear
novel and

both sides have obtained a measure of relief, it is ordered
that each side will bear its own costs.

Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .As noted after _Campbell v. Seaman_ , coming to the
nuisance is a perennial problem, and is usually handled with a multi-factor
balancing test. Is

coming to the nuisance like a prescriptive easement (see
Note 7 after _Campbell v. Seaman_ ) but without the expectation that the victim
of the nuisance

will sue? Should the first mover simply pay low damages to
owners of neighboring vacant lots ( _Boomer_ ) and benefit from a coming to the
nuisance

defense if development occurs?

2 .Recall again the framework of property rules and
liability rules developed by Calabresi and Melamed. This framework suggests the
existence of

four rules for handling nuisance disputes, based on which
party is given the entitlement and whether the entitlement is protected by a
property rule or

liability rule. The framework thus led to the “discovery” of
Rule 4 , in which the polluter would have the “entitlement” to pollute, but
protected only by a

liability rule. See also James R. Atwood, Note, An Economic
Analysis of Land Use Conflicts, 21 Stan. L. Rev. 293 ( 1969 ) (advocating
injunctions with

plaintiff compensating defendant in some coming to the
nuisance cases). That is, one or more residents could sue to stop the
pollution, but would have to

pay the polluter’s cost of abating or shutting down. The
fact that the Arizona Supreme Court came up with something that looks very much
like Rule 4

at roughly the same time Calabresi and Melamed wrote has
been cited by subsequent commentators as vindicating the utility of their
modeling exercise.

3 .Indeed, a number of commentators have sought to build on
the remedial innovation reflected in _Spur_ and Calabresi and Melamed’s Rule 4.
See,

e.g., Ellickson, Alternatives to Zoning, supra, at 744 – 46
(arguing for use of Rule 4 as a second stage option for the plaintiff when a
nuisance defendant

opts to pay Rule 2 damages and continues the nuisance); Jeff
L. Lewin, Compensated Injunctions and the Evolution of Nuisance Law, 71 Iowa L.
Rev.

775 , 827 – 31 ( 1986 ) (arguing for limited use of
compensated injunctions in the interest of fairness); Edward Rabin, Nuisance
Law: Rethinking

```

Fundamental Assumptions, 63 Va. L. Rev. 1299 , 1339 – 46 (
1977 ) (advocating compensated injunctions in cases of deserving plaintiffs
only); see also Ian

Ayres & Paul M. Goldbart, Optimal Delegation and
Decoupling in the Design of Liability Rules, 100 Mich. L. Rev. 1 ( 2001 ); Saul
Levmore, Unifying

Remedies: Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Startling
Rules, 106 Yale L.J. 2149 ( 1997 ). Others have been less enthusiastic about
the possibility of

Rule 4. See, e.g., Richard A. Epstein, A Clear View of _The
Cathedral_ : The Dominance of Property Rules, 106 Yale L.J. 2091 , 2103 – 05 (
1997 )

(criticizing Rule 4 as destabilizing property); Jeanne L.
Schroeder, Three’s a Crowd: A Feminist Critique of Calabresi and Melamed’s _One
View of the

Cathedral_ , 84 Cornell L. Rev. 394 , 438 ( 1999 )
(providing feminist critique of Rule 4 ); Henry E. Smith, Exclusion and
Property Rules in the Law of

Nuisance, 90 Va. L. Rev. 965 , 1007 – 21 ( 2004 )
(portraying Rule 4 as inconsistent with a system of basic entitlements that
minimizes information costs).

4 .In fact, it appears that _Spur_ has received much more
attention from law review articles than from courts. Andrew Morriss reports
that “ _Spur_ has

not had much direct influence” on the law of nuisance in
Arizona, and that “[t]he only reported decision from outside Arizona to
consider in detail the

doctrinal developments in _Spur_ came in an Ohio Common
Pleas Court decision rejecting _Spur_ as inapplicable because of the greater
amount of open

space in Arizona.” Andrew P. Morriss, Cattle v. Retirees:
Sun City and the Battle of _Spur Industries v. Del E. Webb Development Co._ ,
in Property Stories

337 (Gerald Korngold & Andrew P. Morriss eds., 2 d ed.
2009 ). What accounts for the paucity of judicial interest in the _Spur_
remedy? Consider what

would have happened if the conflict in _Spur_ had simply
been between the residents of Sun City and the feedlot. Does the court regard
the senior citizens

as innocent parties from whom it would not be appropriate to
require payments to Spur? Would the residents have had much success in coming
up with

the money to purchase an injunction closing the feedlot?
Given the collective-action difficulties this would have posed, how likely is
it that a court

would adopt such a remedy? See James E. Krier & Stewart
J. Schwab, Property Rules and Liability Rules: The Cathedral in Another Light,
70 N.Y.U. L.

Rev. 440 , 470 ( 1995 ).

5 .More fundamentally, what is the nature of “the
entitlement” under Rule 4? Does the Blackstonian package of rights ever come
with a “right to

pollute”? Would someone with such a “right to pollute” (in
the sense of not being liable in nuisance) be able to enjoin the resident from
blocking the

pollution—as with fans or a wall? (Probably not.) Again, one
might acquire an easement, by prescription or negotiation, to pollute and this
would add to

the polluter’s default package of entitlements. See Henry E.
Smith, Complexity and the Cathedral: Making Law and Economics More Calabresian,
48

Eur. J.L. & Econ. 43 , 54 – 57 ( 2019 ). Does the
Calabresi and Melamed framework rest on a flawed conception that whenever a
court rules against a

plaintiff the defendant has an entitlement that must either
be purchased (Rule 3 ) or taken for just compensation (Rule 4 ) in order to
achieve a different

result?

Public Nuisance

Note that Del Webb brought a public nuisance action in Spur
, whereas the other cases we have considered are private nuisance actions.

Public nuisance is as old as private nuisance, but has a
very different history. The original action for public nuisance was a criminal
proceeding

brought in local sheriffs’ courts called “leets.” The
paradigmatic public nuisance was blocking a public highway or a navigable
waterway,

although actions were also brought for a miscellany of harms
to community welfare such as “washing hemp or flax in streams or ponds used for

watering cattle,” letting animals “wander suffering from the
scab,” selling “unwholesome food,” or catching “immature fish or hunting out of

season.” J.R. Spencer, Public Nuisance—A Critical
Examination, 48 Cambridge L.J. 55 , 60 (1989). Public nuisance entered the
common law in a

limited fashion pursuant to a dictum in a 1535 decision
suggesting that persons who suffer “special injury” from a public nuisance like
blocking a

highway could sue for their individual harm in the common
law courts. Anon., Y.B. Mich. 27 Hen. 8, f. 27, pl. 10 (1535). Nevertheless,
most

public nuisance suits continued to be brought by public
officials like the attorney general (this remains true in both the U.K. and the
U.S. today).

Do you agree that Del Webb and his real estate development
company suffered special injury—usually interpreted to mean an injury different
in

kind from that suffered by other members of the
community—from the flies and odors emanating from the cattle feedlot?

Because public nuisance was historically regarded as a
crime, an action for public nuisance in the United States requires that it be

authorized by the legislature. Some states have enacted
generic statutes authorizing suits for a public nuisance, without meaningfully
defining the

term. Others, as in the Arizona statute quoted in Spur ,
provide more specific direction about the things that qualify as a public
nuisance. Over

time, through a combination of piecemeal legislation and
judicial extrapolations from conventional catalogues of public harms, the
concept came

to encompass a variety of threats to public health, safety,
and comfort. These have included keeping a vicious dog, cultivating black
currants

(thought to cause pine blister rust), and even putting on an
opera that threatens to cause a riot. See Star Opera Co. v. Hylan, 178 N.Y.S.
179 (N.Y.

Sup. Ct. 1919) (refusing to enjoin officials from
prohibiting the performance of a German-language opera until ratification of
peace treaty with

Germany, where the company’s past performances had led to
riotous conduct and police intervention).

Perhaps because actions by private parties pursuant to the
special injury exception look very much like a tort action, William Prosser, as

Reporter for the Restatement (Second) of Torts, decided in
the late 1960s that public nuisance should be added to the Restatement. The
result was

that the Second Restatement defines a public nuisance to
have many of the features of private nuisance, with its emphasis on balancing
and the

#979

understanding that courts have inherent authority to declare
something to be a public nuisance. See Thomas W. Merrill, Is Public Nuisance a

Tort?, 4 J. Tort L. Issue 2, Article 4 (2011). This
revisionism had little effect on the legal system until a coalition of state
attorneys general sued

the tobacco industry in the 1990s, claiming that misleading
marketing of cigarettes had created a public nuisance in the form of massive
health

care costs borne by state governments. Although no court
determined that this was a public nuisance, when the action settled for $246
billion, it

stimulated (and provided seed money for) a series of similar
actions seeking recovery of huge damage awards for various social ills such as
lead

paint residue in older buildings, injuries caused by the
widespread availability of firearms, the effects of climate change, and (most
recently) the

marketing of slow-release opioid pills like Oxycontin said
to be responsible for the opioid addiction crisis. Success in these various
litigation

campaigns has been mixed, but the large settlement achieved
in the tobacco case and significant settlements in some of the opioid cases
mean

that public nuisance’s role as a kind of supertort is far
from over. For background, see Donald G. Gifford, Suing the Tobacco and Lead
Pigment

Industries (2010); Nora Freeman Engstrom & Robert L.
Rabin, Pursuing Public Health Through Litigation: Lessons from Tobacco and
Opioids,

73 Stan. L. Rev. 285, 301–05 (2021).

### B. SERVITUDES

Nuisance law is hardly the last word on land-use conflict.
Conflicts among neighbors can also be resolved by contract. Any two neighbors

or even a group of neighbors can enter into a contract that
commits them to certain behavior regarding the use of their land, and this will
be

enforced like any other bilateral contract. But such
contracts would be of limited usefulness if they were binding only on the
initial parties to the

agreement. If one of the parties sold her land and moved
away, the original deal would no longer be of any use, and the remaining party
might

not be able to strike a new deal with the new owner. The
important contribution of property law here has been the development of
doctrines that

allow parties to enter into contracts that “run with the
land,” meaning the terms and conditions of the agreement are binding not only
on the

original owners but on all future owners of both the
benefited and the burdened parcels. Contracts that bind successors in ownership
are

generically called “servitudes.”

The two principal types of servitudes are easements and
covenants. Very roughly speaking, an easement is functionally like a contract
in

which an owner agrees to waive his or her right to exclude
certain kinds of intrusions by another and give the other a right to use; a
covenant is a

contract in which an owner agrees to abide by certain
restrictions on the use of his or her land for the benefit of one or more
others. Covenants

are thus more of a governance mechanism and more often than
easements prescribe affirmative behavior on the part of the burdened landowner.

#980

Covenants against commercial use, for maximum building
height, and even for door color have been used to control spillovers sometimes
of a

very subtle sort that would not fall under the law of
nuisance. Appurtenant easements always run with the land. Covenants sometimes
run with

the land if certain conditions are met, which we will
consider in some detail. Easements have always been regarded as a type of
property right,

the exact significance of this appellation (beyond the
understanding that easements run with the land) being somewhat unclear.
Covenants, even

when they run with the land, are less often described as a
type of property; rather they are usually spoken of as “promises respecting the
use of

land.” Although authority on this point is scant, it appears
that easements have an in rem effect, in the sense that third parties may not
interfere

with the performance of rights under an easement. Covenants,
however, generally do not give rise to any rights against third parties (other
than

successors to the burdened and benefited parcels), and in
this sense are more accurately thought to be in personam.

Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, 1938.



18 N.E. 2 d 362.



```

■
LUMMUS, JUSTICE. The plaintiff, engaged in the business of controlling
locations for billboards and signs and contracting with advertisers for the

exhibition of their placards and posters, obtained from the
defendant on October 9, 1934, a writing signed but not sealed by the defendant

whereby the defendant “in consideration of twenty-five
dollars * * * agrees to give” the plaintiff “the exclusive right and privilege
to maintain

advertising sign one ten feet by twenty-five feet on wall of
building 3003 Washington Street” in Boston, owned by the defendant, “for a
period of

one year with the privilege of renewal from year to year for
four years more at the same consideration.” It was provided that “all signs
placed on

the premises remain the personal property” of the plaintiff.
The writing was headed “Lease No. ___.” It was not to be effective until
accepted by

the plaintiff.

It was accepted in writing on November 10, 1934, when the
plaintiff sent the defendant a check for $25, the agreed consideration for the

first year. The defendant returned the check. The plaintiff
nevertheless erected the contemplated sign, and maintained it until February
23, 1937,

sending the defendant early in November of the years 1935
and 1936 checks for $25 which were returned. On February 23, 1937, the
defendant

caused the sign to be removed. On February 26, 1937, the
plaintiff brought this bill for specific performance, contending that the

#981

writing was a lease. The judge ruled that the writing was a
contract to give a license, but on November 2, 1937, entered a final decree for
specific

performance, with damages and costs. The defendant appealed.
It is stipulated that on November 3, 1937, the plaintiff tendered $25 for the

renewal of its right for another year beginning November 10,
1937, but the defendant refused the money.

The distinction between a lease and a license is plain,
although at times it is hard to classify a particular instrument. A lease of
land conveys

an interest in land, requires a writing to comply with the
statute of frauds though not always a seal and transfers possession. A license
merely

excuses acts done by one on land in possession of another
that without the license would be trespasses, conveys no interest in land, and
may be

contracted for or given orally. A lease of a roof or a wall
for advertising purposes is possible. Alfano v. Donnelly, 189 N.E. 610 (Mass.
193 4).

The writing in question, however, giving the plaintiff the
“exclusive right and privilege to maintain advertising sign * * * on wall of
building,”

but leaving the wall in the possession of the owner with the
right to use it for all purposes not forbidden by the contract and with all the

responsibilities of ownership and control, is not a lease.
Gaertner v. Donnelly, Mass., 5 N.E.2d 419 (Mass. 1936); and cases cited. The
fact that in

one corner of the writing are found the words, “Lease No.
___,” does not convert it into a lease. Those words are merely a misdescription
of the

writing.

Subject to the right of a licensee to be on the land of
another for a reasonable time after the revocation of a license, for the
purpose of

removing his chattels, it is of the essence of a license
that it is revocable at the will of the possessor of the land. * * * Am.Law
Inst. Restatement:

Torts, §§ 167–171. The revocation of a license may
constitute a breach of contract, and give rise to an action for damages. But it
is none the less

effective to deprive the licensee of all justification for
entering or remaining upon the land. * * * Compare Hurst v. Picture Theatres,
Ltd., [1915]

1 K.B. 1 (Ct. App.).

If what the plaintiff bargained for and received was a
license, and nothing more, then specific performance that might compel the
defendant

to renew the license, leaving it revocable at will, would be
futile and for that reason should not be granted. 5 Williston, Contracts
(Rev.Ed.)

§ 1 442; Am.Law.Inst.Restatement: Contracts, § 377. Specific
performance that might render the license irrevocable for the term of the
contract

would convert it into an equitable estate in land, and give
the plaintiff more than the contract gave. There can be no specific performance
of a

contract to give a license, at least in the absence of fraud
or estoppel.

The writing in the present case, however, seems to us to go
beyond a mere license. It purports to give “the exclusive right and privilege
to

maintain” a certain sign on the defendant’s wall. So far as
the law permits, it should be so construed as to vest in the plaintiff the
right

#982

which it purports to give. That right is in the nature of an
easement in gross, which, whatever may be the law elsewhere, is recognized in

Massachusetts. Goodrich v. Burbank, 94 Mass. (12 Allen) 459
(1866); Carville v. Commonwealth, 78 N.E. 735 (Mass. 1906); American

Telephone & Telegraph Co. of Massachusetts v. McDonald,
173 N.E. 502 (Mass. 1930); Jones v. Stevens, 177 N.E. 91 (Mass. 1931). We see
no

objection to treating the writing as a grant for one year
and a contract to grant for four more years an easement in gross thus limited
to five years.

Similar writings have been so treated in other
jurisdictions.

An easement, being inconsistent with seisin in the person
owning it, always lay in grant and could not be created by livery of seisin.
Randall

v. Chase, 133 Mass. 210, 214 (1882). It is an interest in
land within the statute of frauds and, apart from prescription, requires a
writing for its

creation. G.L.(Ter.Ed.) c. 183, § 3. Cook v. Stearns, 11
Mass. 533 (1814). Indeed, the creation of a legal freehold interest in an
easement, apart

from prescription, requires a deed. And differing from a
lease of land for not more than seven years (Alfano v. Donnelly, 189 N.E. 610,
612

(Mass. 1934)), a grant of an easement for as short a term as
five years apparently requires a deed in order to create a legal interest. Wood
v.

Leadbitter, 153 Eng. Rep. 351 (Ex. 1845) 13 M. & W. 8
38; Chadwick v. Covell, 23 N.E. 1068 (Mass. 1890); Walker Ice Co. v. American
Steel &

Wire Co., 70 N.E. 937 (Mass. 1904), and especially Loring,
J. at 70 N.E. 93 7. But in equity a seal is not necessary to the creation of an
easement.

Since equity treats an act as done where there is a duty to
do it enforceable in equity, or, as more tersely phrased, equity treats that as
done which

ought to be done, an enforceable unsealed contract such as
the writing in this case, providing for the creation of an easement, actually
creates an

easement in equity.

There is no error in the final decree granting specific
performance. The affirmance of this decree will not prevent an assessment of
the

damages as of the date of the final decree after rescript.

Interlocutory decree overruling demurrer affirmed.

Varieties of Easements

Easements are very common. They were recognized in Roman law
and exist in some form in virtually all modern legal systems. What are

the distinguishing features of an easement? On the one hand,
an easement differs from other property rights such as a fee simple or a lease

because an easement conveys the right to a particular use of
land, as opposed to the right to possession of land. One can think of a
possessory

right as being a kind of gatekeeper right that allows the
possessor to determine all of the uses to which the property will be devoted
(out of a

large and open-ended set of possibilities), and who will be
allowed to engage in them. An easement, in contrast, is a conveyance of a right
to

engage in one particular use, ordinarily given to one
particular person or set of persons. In terms of the bundle of sticks metaphor,
a possessory

#983

right conveys a full bundle of sticks; an easement conveys
just one stick out of the bundle. On the other hand, an easement differs from a
mere

license that permits someone to engage in a particular use
of the land. A license is a waiver of the right to exclude that often arises by
contract—

and is (ordinarily) regarded as being revocable (see Chapter
IV). An easement, however, is regarded as an irrevocable conveyance of the
right to

engage in a particular use of land. (It need not be
indefinitely irrevocable; it can be irrevocable for a term of years, as in
Baseball Publishing .)

Easements have always been regarded as a type of property
right, even though they convey only delimited use rights. One reason for

regarding easements as property is purely formal—they are
created by grant rather than by contract (see the next Section for more on what
this

means). But there is a danger of circularity, in that one
can just as easily argue that easements must be created by grant because they
are property

as that easements are property because they are created by
grant. A more substantive reason is the feature of irrevocability. Easements
have a

“vested” quality that distinguishes them from gratuitous
licenses and most licenses arising by contract. A third possible reason is that
easements

do have in rem features. Although the relationship between
the grantor and grantee of an easement looks much like a bilateral exchange of

promises, a valid easement also gives rise to a general duty
on the part of “all the world” not to interfere with the easement. Thus, for
example, if

B has an easement to cross the land of A, a third
party—C—would be guilty of a wrong if C attempted to block B’s passage across
A’s land.

A basic distinction within the universe of easements is
between easements appurtenant and easements in gross. An easement appurtenant
is

one that belongs to another parcel of land. So for example,
assume Whiteacre and Blackacre are adjacent parcels of land. Whiteacre is owned
by

Sally and Blackacre is owned by Dan. Sally grants Dan an
easement appurtenant to cross Whiteacre to reach Blackacre. Since the easement
is

appurtenant, it “belongs” to Blackacre, and is carved out of
Whiteacre. This means that the benefit of the easement belongs to whoever
happens

to own Blackacre, and the burden of the easement belongs to
whoever happens to own Whiteacre. The law speaks of Blackacre as being the

dominant tract (the tract benefited or enhanced by the
easement); and Whiteacre as being the servient tract (the tract burdened by or
out of which

is carved the easement). If Dan sells Blackacre to Daniella,
Daniella as the owner of the dominant tract now has the right to use the right
of way;

Dan no longer has any rights in the easement. Similarly, if
Sally sells Whiteacre to Saul, Saul is now the owner of the servient tract
burdened by

the easement; Sally is off the hook. Loosely speaking, an
easement in gross is one that belongs to a particular grantee, as opposed to
belonging to

a particular tract of land. Suppose Sally grants Dan an
easement in gross to fish in the pond on

#984

Whiteacre. Now, the benefit of the easement belongs to Dan
personally, not to whoever happens to be the owner of Blackacre. If Dan sells

Blackacre to Daniella, the easement in gross remains with
Dan; Daniella has no rights to fish in the pond unless she gets her own
easement.

English courts recognized only easements appurtenant. An
attempt to create an easement in gross created only a license personal to the

grantee. Such a conveyance was not inheritable, i.e., would
not pass on death to the heirs of the grantee, and was not transferable to a
third party.

American courts have been more sympathetic to easements in
gross. The usual explanation is the emergence of the railroad industry in

nineteenth-century America. In order to build a railroad, it
was necessary to acquire the right to operate along a long narrow strip of land
cutting

across hundreds of separately owned parcels of property. For
various reasons, many owners were willing to grant easements to railroads (or
were

willing to allow railroads to condemn easements), but were
more reluctant to convey a fee simple in a strip of land to a railroad. But
such an

easement, crossing many separate parcels, would not be
appurtenant to any particular tract of land; it would be in gross to the
railroad enterprise.

So, in order to accommodate the growth of the railroad
industry, many American courts concluded that easements in gross could be
created that

were inheritable and transferable—provided the grant was of
a commercial character. Thus, most American states permitted easements in gross

for railroad or utility purposes—or for the erection of
billboards, as in the Baseball Publishing case—whereas in England one would
have to use

grants of a fee simple or leases to accomplish these
purposes. Although courts have been increasingly liberal about permitting
parties to create

inheritable and transferable easements in gross, most courts
continue to hold that easements in gross for purely recreational purposes such
as

hunting, camping, boating, or fishing are not inheritable or
transferable. See Note, The Easement in Gross Revisited: Transferability and

Divisibility Since 1945, 39 Vand. L. Rev. 109 (1986).

Closely related to an easement in gross, but narrower in
purpose, is something called a profit à prendre , or “profit” for short. This
is the

right to enter on the land of another in order to extract
something of value, such as timber, or fruit from trees, or fish or game from a
lake or

forest. It is also used to permit extraction of surface
minerals, such as sand or gravel, although deep rock mining and oil and gas
extraction are

usually governed by mineral leases. Profits are very ancient
and were recognized by the English common law. They are generally governed by

the same rules as easements appurtenant. The grant of a
profit carries with it an implied license to enter the land for purposes of
carrying out the

profit, and this license remains irrevocable as long as the
profit continues.

Another basic distinction among easements is between
affirmative easements and negative easements. Affirmative easements permit the

easement holder to perform some affirmative act on the land
of another.

#985

One can think of an affirmative easement as permitting
action on the servient tract that otherwise would be a trespass or an invasive
nuisance. A

negative easement permits the easement holder to demand that
the owner of the servient tract desist from certain actions that might harm the

easement holder. Virtually all easements are affirmative
easements. English common law recognized only four narrow categories of
negative

easements: blocking sunlight from falling on windows on the
dominant tenement; interfering with the flow of air in a defined channel to the

dominant tenement; removing lateral support to a building on
the dominant tenement; and interfering with the flow of water in an artificial

stream to the dominant tenement. English law also permitted
easements to be established by prescription in these four narrow areas. (See

Fontainebleau Hotel Corp. v. Forty-Five Twenty-Five, Inc.,
infra.) American courts have been somewhat more adventuresome about permitting

express negative easements outside the traditional four
categories. For example, the California Supreme Court once upheld a negative
easement

for an unobstructed view of San Francisco Bay over a
neighboring property. Petersen v. Friedman, 328 P.2d 264 (Cal. Ct. App. 1958).
As a rule,

however, when someone wants to impose a negative duty on a
servient landowner to desist from taking action that might harm the dominant

tract, lawyers today will accomplish this by drafting a
covenant that runs with the land. Once running covenants were recognized in
Tulk v.

Moxhay , infra, the logical thing to do would have been to
have restricted easements to affirmative easements (waivers of exclusion
rights) and to

have required that all negative duties imposed on servient
landowners be embodied in written covenants. This is the general thrust of the
way

things are done, but the doctrine is not quite that tidy.

A final distinction that is sometimes of importance is
between private easements and public easements. Private easements authorize
specific

named parties (individuals or enterprises) to use land for
designated purposes. Public easements authorize the general public to use land
for

designated purposes. Public roads, highways, and navigable
waterways are most often owned in fee simple by some governmental entity,
subject

(in the case of navigable water) to a trust obligation to
the public (see Chapter III). But occasionally they are held as easements, in
which case the

public holds only a right to use the property, and the
underlying owner of the underlying fee retains all other rights. Public access
rights for

recreational purposes, such as beaches, bike trails, and
portages, are more likely to be held as public easements than are roads and
highways.

Sometimes the public holds negative easements, such as
scenic easements, conservation easements, or historic preservation easements.
These,

like public easements of access, can be acquired by
condemnation as well as by gift or purchase.

#986

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Why was the common law so hostile to the creation of
easements in gross? After the development of recording acts that permit the
recording of

property interests like easements, is there any continuing
reason to disfavor easements in gross?

2 .Easements ordinarily can be subdivided. For example, if
Blackacre has an easement of way over Whiteacre, and Blackacre is subdivided
into

four lots, absent previous agreement to the contrary each of
the new lot owners will have an easement over Whiteacre. Should parties be
permitted to

subdivide easements in gross? Suppose the Baseball
Publishing Company wants to subdivide its easement in gross in order to allow
three different firms

to post billboards in the space initially designated for the
Baseball Publishing Company. Do you foresee any problems in permitting this to
happen?

3 .How does the court in _Baseball Publishing_ weigh
different evidence in determining whether the agreement creates a license,
lease, or easement?

In a more recent decision considering whether a document
created a license or an easement, the Court of Appeals of Kansas weighed five
factors, none

dispositive on their own: ( 1 ) the manner of creation of
the right, including the existence or absence of words ordinarily used in the
conveyance of real

estate; ( 2 ) the nature of the right created, including
whether the holder of the right can maintain or improve the burdened property;
( 3 ) the duration of the

right, which if set or perpetual is more likely indicative
of an easement; ( 4 ) the amount of consideration given for the right, with a
more substantial

amount being indicative of an easement; and ( 5 ) whether
any right to revoke or terminate the right is reserved, with revocability more
likely to indicate a

license. Gilman v. Blocks, 235 P. 3 d 503 (Kan. Ct. App.
2010 ). In that case, similar to _Baseball Publishing_ , the court disregarded
frequent use of the term

“license” in the agreement. Should the express term used by
the parties carry more import? If not, which of these factors seems most
important?

4 .Notice that _Baseball Publishing_ is another illustration
of the _numerus clausus_ principle. The parties have an agreement that would
allow the

company to use the side of a building for a series of five
renewable one-year terms for purposes of putting up an advertising sign. In
order to ascertain

the legal effect of this agreement, the court feels
compelled to assign the agreement to one of several possible boxes: license,
lease, or easement in gross.

Should the court proceed this way, or should it just
recognize a new interest (“advertising sign privileges on buildings for
renewable terms”) that

corresponds with the apparent intentions of the parties?

b.CREATION OF EASEMENTS

Although easements are regarded as property rights, at
common law they could not be created by the quaint ceremony of livery of
seisin,

only by grant. To create property by grant, including an
easement, the grantor must deliver to the grantee a deed to the property. A
deed, in turn,

was originally understood to mean a writing under seal. The
seal was a

#987

unique mark or symbol, impressed on paper with melted wax.
Over the years, the requirement of melted wax was softened, to the point where

today in most jurisdictions a deed is just a piece of paper
that conveys a property right—although in some jurisdictions formalities such
as

attestation of signatures by notaries or witnesses are still
required. Because an easement is an interest in land, the Statute of Frauds
also requires

that easements be in writing.

The common law imposed another limitation on the creation of
easements that sometimes can provide a trap for the unwary. An easement

could be created by grant, of the direct A-to-B variety.
Alternatively, an easement could be created by reservation to the grantor, A,
in a grant to

B of a possessory interest in land. Thus, if A granted
Blackacre to B, A could in the deed granting Blackacre reserve to himself an
easement over

Blackacre, perhaps to access other land retained by the
grantor. But, at common law one could not create a grant by reservation in a
third party.

For example, if A granted Blackacre to B, A could not in the
deed to B reserve an easement in Blackacre running to C. Some modern American

courts have disapproved of this rule. See, e.g., Willard v.
First Church of Christ, Scientist, 498 P.2d 987 (Cal. 1972). They have reasoned
that the

original rationale for the rule was to prevent easements,
which were created by grant rather than livery of seisin, from being used to do
an end

run around the rules of seisin important to the feudal
system. Feudalism being dead, these courts have reasoned, the rule against
creating

easements in third parties by reservation should also be
rejected. Can you think of other possible rationales for the rule against
creating

easements by reservation in third parties? If the recording
system in the jurisdiction has only a grantor-grantee index, and does not have
a tract

index, might there be situations in which it would be hard
to discover that someone like C holds an easement created by reservation in a
deed

between A and B?

All this sounds reasonably straightforward: If you want to
create an easement, get a lawyer to put it in writing, follow whatever
formalities

are necessary to create a deed, and record the instrument in
the local registry of deeds. Unfortunately, people seem more prone to ignore
the need

for writings and lawyers where easements are concerned, than
they are when conveying possessory interests. There are a variety of possible

reasons for this. Easements are generally of lower value (in
the grand scheme of things) than possessory interests, and this may account for
more

rational ignorance about the requirements of the law. Also,
norms of neighborly accommodation often serve as a substitute for, or a
supplement

to, explicit easements. People may rely on these norms, and
may even feel that it is unneighborly to demand that informal understandings be

formalized in legal agreements. In any event, the need for a
writing is often ignored, and this has given rise to lots of litigation about
issues of

access to land. Courts have responded by creating a variety
of doctrines that allow easements or easement-like rights to be

#988

recognized without any writing: doctrines that recognize
easements by implication, necessity, prescription, or estoppel. Courts have
held that

when these doctrines apply, they constitute an implied
exception to the requirements of the Statute of Frauds.

#### Schwab v. Timmons

```



Supreme Court of Wisconsin, 1999.



589 N.W. 2 d 1.



```

■ JON P.
WILCOX, J. The petitioners, James and Katherine Schwab and Dorice McCormick
(petitioners), seek review of a decision affirming the

circuit court’s dismissal of their declaratory judgment
action requesting an easement by necessity or by implication for both ingress
and egress

and utilities over the properties owned by the respondents
in order to gain access to their landlocked parcels located in Door County. The
circuit

court, as affirmed by the court of appeals, concluded that
the historical circumstances in this case do not fit the typical situation from
which ways

of necessity are implied and that even if they did, the
easement would not have survived because it was not recorded.

On appeal, the petitioners claim they are entitled to an
easement by necessity or by implication over the respondents’ properties; or in
the

alternative, they seek an expansion of the common law in
this state to recognize an easement by necessity where property is landlocked
due to

geographical barriers and due to the actions of the common
owner and grantor, in this case the United States. We conclude that the
petitioners

have failed to establish entitlement to an easement by
implication or by necessity either because of actions by the federal government
or by

geographical barriers. Not only were the parcels at issue
not landlocked at the time of conveyance, but the petitioners themselves
created their

landlocked parcels when they conveyed away their highway
access. We refuse to turn 100-plus years of Wisconsin common law on its head to

accommodate such actions. Accordingly, we affirm the court
of appeals.

I.

The facts are not in dispute. The petitioners and the
respondents all own property that is located on Green Bay in the Village of
Ephraim in

Door County. The properties are situated between the waters
of Green Bay on the west and a bluff ranging in height from 37 to 60 feet on
the

east. [Figure 9-4] is a diagram of the properties (lots and
parcels) involved.

Prior to 1854, the property involved was owned by the United
States and was divided into three lots: Lot 2, the northernmost lot; Lot 3; and

Lot 4, the southernmost lot. In 1854, the United States
granted by patent Lot 4 to Ingebret Torgerson, but retained Lots 2 and 3. At
the time that

Lot 4 was severed from Lots 2 and 3, the United States did
not retain a right-of-way through Lot 4 to get to Lots 2 and 3. At oral
argument, it was

explained that at the time of this conveyance by the United
States,

#989

the eastern boundary of the lots extended to the east to
what is now a public roadway. The lots were comprised of property both above
and below

the bluff with access to a public roadway from above. In
1882, the United States granted Lots 2 and 3 to Halvor Anderson.

At some point after the United States granted the lots, they
were further subdivided into parcels. After 1854, Lots 2, 3, and 4 were never

fully owned by one person or entity * * *

The petitioners’ parcels are located in Lot 2, the
northernmost lot. McCormick owns the northernmost parcel and the Schwabs own
two

adjacent parcels directly south of McCormick. Together the
properties comprise over 1200 feet of frontage and over nine acres of property.

Directly south of the Schwabs’ parcels is a parcel owned by
the Timmons within Lot 2, followed to the south by a parcel owned by the
Lenzes,

also in Lot 2; all of the remaining respondents’ parcels
follow sequentially to the south, located in Lots 3 and 4, with the parcel
owned by Hobler

being the southernmost parcel located at the southern
boundary of Lot 4.

It was indicated at oral argument that the current eastern
boundary line, the bluff line—which produced parcels above and below the bluff—

was created at various unknown times. The Schwabs’ parcels
were originally purchased by James’ parents in the 1940s and were later gifted
to

James in 1965 and 1974. At purchase, the Schwabs’ parcels
extended east from the waters of Green Bay to property above the bluff where
there

was access to a public roadway and a house. Some time after
the 1974 inheritance, the Schwabs conveyed the property above the bluff to
James’

relatives and retained the parcel below. McCormick also
inherited her parcel which originally included land above and below the bluff
with

highway access from above, and she conveyed the property
above the bluff to a third party, retaining the parcel below.

As they currently stand, both of the petitioners’ parcels
are bordered by water on the east [sic] and the bluff on the west [sic].
Because their

properties are between the lake and the bluff, the
petitioners claim their only access is over the land to the south, owned by the
respondents, for

which they do not have a right-of-way.

A private road runs north from Hobler’s parcel across all of
the respondents’ properties terminating on the Lenz parcel. Timmons also has

the right to use the private road. This is the road that the
petitioners are seeking to extend for their use. Negotiations for an agreement
to extend

the road have failed.

#990

Figure 9-4

Map from Schwab v. Timmons

In 1988, the petitioners petitioned the Village of Ephraim,
pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 80.13 (1985–86), to extend a public road—North Shore

Drive—to the private road beginning at the Hobler property
northward over all of the respondents’ properties to McCormick’s property.
Section

80.13 allows a landowner to request the local government, in
its discretion, to construct a public roadway at the petitioning landowners’
expense.

The Village of Ephraim board, however, declined the request
finding that extending the road was not in the public’s interest.

Consequently, the petitioners brought this declaratory
judgment action seeking an easement by necessity or by implication to gain
access to

their land. The easement would include the perpetual right
to travel, including the right for ingress, egress and for public utilities,
over the now

private road, which stretches over 15 of the respondents’
parcels to the Lenz property, as well as the right to build a road over the
Lenz and

#991

Timmons properties up to the McCormick property. The
respondents filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint.^3 * * *

III.

The petitioners claim an easement by implication or by
necessity over the respondents’ properties. An easement is a “liberty,
privilege, or

advantage in lands, without profit, and existing distinct
from the ownership of the land.” Stoesser v. Shore Drive Partnership, 494
N.W.2d 204

(Wis. 1993). With an easement, there are two distinct
property interests—the dominant estate, which enjoys the privileges granted by
an

easement and the servient estate, which permits the exercise
of those privileges. An easement can be used only in connection with the real
estate

to which it belongs.

Easements by implication and by necessity are similar, but
legally distinguishable concepts. Since the early 1900s, the public policy in

Wisconsin has strongly opposed the implication of covenants
of conveyance, i.e., easements. Backhausen v. Mayer, 234 N.W. 904 (Wis. 1931);

Miller v. Hoeschler, 105 N.W. 790 (Wis. 1905).

An easement by implication arises when there has been a
“separation of title, a use before separation took place which continued so
long

and was so obvious or manifest as to show that it was meant
to be permanent, and it must appear that the easement is necessary to the
beneficial

enjoyment of the land granted or retained.” Bullis v.
Schmidt, 93 N.W.2d 476, 478–79 (Wis. 1958) (quoting 1 Thompson, Real Property §
390 at

630 (perm. ed.)).^4 Implied easements may only be created
when the necessity for the easement is “so clear and absolute that without the

easement the grantee cannot enjoy the use of the property
granted to him for the purposes to which similar property is customarily
devoted.”

Bullis, 93 N.W.2d at 480 (quoting Miller, 105 N.W. at 792).

The petitioners have failed to establish a claim for an
easement by implication. While a landlocked parcel may satisfy the necessity
element,

it is apparent from the amended complaint that the private
road the petitioners seek to extend does not and has never extended to the
petitioners’

properties. They have failed to allege that any use by the
United States was so obvious, manifest or continuous as to show that it was
meant to be

permanent. * * *

#992

An easement of necessity “arises where an owner severs a
landlocked portion of his [or her] property by conveying such parcel to
another.”

Ludke v. Egan, 274 N.W.2d 641 (Wis. 1979). To establish an
easement by necessity, a party must show common ownership of the two parcels

prior to severance of the landlocked parcel, and that the
owner of the now landlocked parcel cannot access a public roadway from his or
her own

property, Ludke, 274 N.W.2d at 645. If this can be
demonstrated, an easement by necessity will be implied over the land retained
by the grantor.

Id.

The petitioners argue that the United States ownership of
all three lots prior to 1854 satisfies the common ownership requirement—a

question never before addressed by this court. We conclude
that we need not reach that issue because even if the United States’ possession
of the

three lots could constitute common ownership, the
petitioners have conceded that neither Lot 2, nor Lot 3 were landlocked when
the United

States conveyed Lot 4. Rather, at the time of conveyance,
the eastern boundary of the lots was above and east of the bluff (the current
boundary

line). Access to a public roadway was possible above the
bluff. A party may only avail himself or herself of an easement by necessity
when the

common owner severs a landlocked portion of the property and
the owner of the landlocked portion cannot access a public roadway. Id. 274

N.W.2d 641. Because the United States never severed a
landlocked portion of its property that was inaccessible from a public roadway,
the

petitioners have failed to establish the elements for an
easement by necessity.

Nevertheless, petitioners insist that the property was
effectively landlocked because of the geographical barriers inhibiting access.
As the

petitioners see it, their land was landlocked because the
land to the south was owned by an individual, the land to the east and north
was bordered

by a cliff and rocky terrain, and the land to the west was
bordered by the waters of Green Bay. * * *

Wisconsin courts have never before recognized geographical
barriers alone as circumstances warranting an easement by necessity. In fact,

case law suggests otherwise. This court stated in Backhausen
that a way of necessity is not merely one of convenience, and “the law will not

imply such a way where it has provided another method for
obtaining the same at a reasonable expense to the landowner.” Backhausen, 234

N.W. at 905.

While the petitioners have provided evidence that the cost
of building a road over the bluff would cost approximately $700,000[,] an

unreasonable expense, it is apparent that they consider
other methods of access—a stairway, an elevator—unacceptable. Petitioners
narrowly

focus on vehicular access to the lake itself as the only
possible way to enjoy this property. Certainly it may be more convenient for
the petitioners

to seek an extension of the private road to their parcels
rather than travel across the property above the bluff and navigate the bluff,
but that in

itself does not create the right to an easement by
necessity. A grantor is not landlocked when he or she has difficulty getting
from his

#993

or her land to a public road as long as he or she can get
from his or her land to a public road. See Ludke, 274 N.W.2d 641. See also
Sicchio v.

Alvey, 103 N.W.2d 544 (Wis. 1960) (Access to building at
front, even though rear entry was used, does not allow for right-of-way by
necessity

to rear entry of store).

In this case, the petitioners had access to a public road,
albeit not ideal or the most convenient access, which they sold off. Thus, the

petitioners’ current ownership of landlocked property
resulted not from a grant of property to them but by their own acts in
conveying away their

highway access. They were not unwitting purchasers of
landlocked property (stemming from the United States 1854 sale).

An easement by necessity only exists where an owner sells a
landlocked parcel to another, in which case the law will recognize a way of

necessity in the grantee over the land retained by the
grantor. Rock Lake Estates Unit Owners Ass’n v. Township of Lake Mills, 536
N.W.2d

415, 424 (Wis. Ct. App. 1995) (citing Ludke, 274 N.W.2d at
645). The petitioners in this case are the grantors, not the grantees, and as
in Rock

Lake Estates, the conveyances which resulted in their
landlocked property were made by the petitioners when they sold off the
property above

the bluff. We conclude that it would be contrary to this
state’s policy against encumbrances for this court to award an easement to the
petitioners

over parcels of unrelated third parties under these
circumstances.

Finally, the petitioners assert that without an easement
their property will be virtually useless because they will have no way to get
to it.

Thus, the petitioners renew their request for a “drastic”
expansion of the law arguing that there is no rational basis for landlocked
property. The

petitioners suggest that this court set forth a “reasonable
use” test that balances the equities by weighing the competing interests of the
need and

benefit to allow access by easement to develop otherwise
useless land versus the detriment such a burden may place on other property to
use an

existing road. The petitioners insist that the benefit and
policy towards development far outweigh any anticipated costs to the burdened
property.

In order to adopt the petitioners’ proposal, we would have
to ignore not only long-standing precedent in this state, but also
well-established

public policy as illustrated in our recording and conveyance
statutes. Long ago this court recognized:

It is so easy, in conveying a defined piece of land, to
express either any limitations intended to be reserved over it, or to be
conveyed

with it over other land, that the necessity of raising any
such grant or reservation by implication is hardly apparent. Courts of equity

can afford relief where the grant is not of that understood
by both parties to be conveyed, or so understood by one by inducement of

the other. Such rights outside the limits of one’s proper
title seriously derogate from the policy of both

#994

our registry statutes and our statute against implication of
[covenants] in conveyances. That policy is that a buyer of land may rely on

the public records as information of all the conveyances,
and upon the words of the instruments for all rights thereunder.

Miller, 105 N.W. at 792.

More recently in Kordecki v. Rizzo , 317 N.W.2d 479 (Wis.
1982), this court reiterated that a purchaser of real estate has three sources
of

information from which to learn of rights to the land he or
she is about to purchase: (1) reviewing the chain of title; (2) searching other
public

records that may reveal other non-recorded rights, such as
judgments or liens; and (3) inspecting the land itself. These sources may be
irrelevant

under the petitioners’ proposal if someone with a landlocked
piece of property desired a right-of-way through another person’s property “in
the

interest of development.”

The petitioners are effectively asking this court to
sanction hidden easements. An easement which in this case was not created by,
but was,

according to petitioners, clearly intended by the United
States at conveyance. * * *

The decision of the court of appeals is affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .How do you suppose the Schwabs and Ms. McCormick got to
their lakefront parcels between the 1940 s and when the lawsuit was filed in
1996?

Note that Timmons, their neighbor immediately to the south,
is said to have the right to use the private road, even though it does not
extend to his parcel.

2 .In addition to refusing Schwab and McCormick access to
the private road, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin refused to create an easement
by

necessity over the parcels that Schwab and McCormick had
sold to the east, cutting off their previous access to a public road. The court
found that it

would be “contrary to this state’s policy” to create an
easement when the grantors’ actions resulted in them landlocking themselves.
This part of the

opinion was later distinguished by _McCormick v. Schubring_
, 672 N.W. 2 d 63 , 69 (Wisc. 2003 ), which clarified:

```



[O]ur statement in Schwab that, “An easement by necessity
only exists where an owner sells a landlocked parcel to another, in which case



the law will recognize a way of necessity in the grantee
over the land retained by the grantor ,” Schwab, 224 Wis. 2 d at 40 , 589 N.W.
2 d 1



(emphasis in the original), should be read to further
explain that an easement of necessity may traverse property that is or was held
by the



grantor who created the landlocked condition, but cannot
traverse property of an unrelated third party. And, it should not be read to
conclude



that only a grantee may obtain an easement of necessity for
landlocked property. This explanation is also in accord with legal treatises
that



have concluded that both grantees and grantors may seek an
easement



```

```

```



of necessity, Restatement (Third) of Prop.: Creation of
Servitudes § 2. 15 , and the long-standing public policy of this state that
favors



utilization of land. Dillman v. Hoffman, 38 Wis. 559 , 574 (
1875 ).



```

Under current Wisconsin law, then, the Schwabs and
McCormicks might have been able to get an easement by necessity over the
parcels to their east.

Why do you think the court was unsympathetic to this result
in _Schwab_? Which rule—the one suggested in _Schwab_ or the one mentioned in
the excerpt

—seems preferable? Should courts hold _grantors_ to a
stricter requirement of necessity than in cases where the _grantee_ is arguing
for an easement?

3 .Suppose the Schwab and McCormick parcels could be
accessed from the lake by boat during the summer months, and suppose further
that the

principal use of property in Door County is for summer
vacation homes. Would this by itself suffice to defeat a claim for an easement
by implication or

by necessity?

4 .The principal reason cited by the court for the hostility
toward claims of easements by implication and by necessity is that this would
“sanction

hidden easements.” In other words, prospective purchasers
and other persons attempting to ascertain the nature and extent of property
rights in the area

would not be able to discover the existence of the easement
by searching the public records. Why couldn’t the court solve this problem by
insisting that

the petitioners, as a condition of obtaining the equitable
relief they seek, record the judgment granting them an easement by implication
or necessity

along with the other deeds and instruments that pertain to
the title to these lots? Can you think of reasons besides problems of notice
why courts should

be reluctant to recognize easements by implication or
necessity?

5 .About half the states have adopted statutes that provide
for condemnation of private easements for access to landlocked or inaccessible
property.

See, e.g., Sorenson v. Czinger, 852 P. 2 d 1124 , 1127
(Wash. Ct. App. 1993 ), discussing Rev. Code Wash. § 8. 24. 010. Under these
statutes, the landlocked

owner can force the servient owner(s) to convey an easement,
but must pay just compensation (fair market value) for the rights so obtained.
(Typically,

these statutes also require the landlocked owner to apply to
a government official for permission and allow the owner of the proposed
servient land to

object.) Is this a better solution to the problem
illustrated by the principal case than either forcing the parties to negotiate
past a stalemate (as the

Wisconsin Supreme Court’s decision apparently contemplates)
or granting an easement based on a balancing of costs and benefits (as the
petitioners

suggest in their last-ditch argument for a “drastic”
expansion of easements by necessity)? Do rights of private condemnation for
easements of access

satisfy the “public use” requirement of the Fifth Amendment
and parallel provisions of state constitutions (see Chapter X.C)? If your
answer is no, then

why aren’t the common-law doctrines of easements by
implication or necessity also unconstitutional?

■
RICHARDSON, JUSTICE. We granted a hearing in this case to consider whether one
who acquires a valid prescriptive easement over another’s

property nonetheless may be required to compensate that
person for either (1) the fair market value of the easement, or (2) the cost of
removing

or relocating any encroaching structures which interfere
with use of the easement. We conclude that the statutes which define and
validate

prescriptive easements neither authorize nor contemplate an
award to the underlying property owner of compensation for the reasonable value
of

the easement, and that under the circumstances in this case
it would be improper to charge the owner of the easement with any portion of
the cost

of removing encroachments.

Although we disagree with the Court of Appeal’s resolution
of the foregoing issues, its opinion (per Compton, J.) correctly determined the

other issues on appeal from the trial court’s judgment
declaring that plaintiffs had acquired a prescriptive easement over defendant’s
property.

188 Cal.Rptr. 563. Accordingly, we adopt that portion of the
opinion as follows: *

This is an appeal from an equitable decree which declared
that plaintiffs had acquired an easement by prescription over the property of

defendant. Defendant was ordered to dismantle and relocate a
structure which had been erected on its own property but which interfered with

plaintiffs’ use of the easement. [ ]

This action involves two contiguous parcels of real estate
which front on [the west side of] Downey Road in the City of Vernon. Downey

Road runs in a generally north-south direction. The two
parcels are approximately 650 feet deep. Plaintiffs own the southerly parcel
and

defendant owns the northerly parcel. Both parcels were
acquired in 1972 from a common owner.

At the time of acquisition both parcels were unimproved.
Plaintiffs’ arrangement with the seller was that the seller would construct on
the

parcel to be purchased by plaintiffs a large commercial
building erected to plaintiffs’ requirements. The building covered almost the
entire parcel.

A 40 foot wide paved driveway was laid out along the
northern edge of plaintiffs’ property to provide access to loading docks on the
northern

side of plaintiffs’ building.

For its part defendant constructed on its property a
substantially smaller building which ran only about one-half the depth of the
northerly

#997

parcel and left vacant a strip of ground about 150 feet wide
along the side of the parcel which abutted plaintiffs’ property.

From the beginning it was apparent that plaintiff’s 40 foot
wide driveway was inadequate since the large trucks which carried material to

and from plaintiffs’ loading dock could not turn and
position themselves at these docks without traveling onto the defendant’s
property. The

inability of these trucks to make such use of defendant’s
property would destroy the commercial value of plaintiff’s building.

The court found that because of the fact that the
possibility of creating an easement over defendant’s property was considered
and rejected

in the original negotiations between the seller, plaintiffs
and defendant, no easement by implication was created. The trial court further
found that

the existence of the driveway on plaintiffs’ property
militated against the creation of an easement by necessity.

From 1972 until 1979 trucks and other vehicles servicing
plaintiffs’ facility used a portion of the vacant ground on defendant’s
property to

enter, turn, park and leave the area of plaintiffs’ loading
dock. On at least two occasions during that period plaintiffs sought,
unsuccessfully, to

acquire an easement from defendant or to create mutual
easements over plaintiffs’ and defendant’s property.

In 1979 defendant developed plans to construct a warehouse
on the southerly portion of the property including that portion of the property

being used by plaintiffs. A pad of earth was raised along
the southerly portion of defendant’s property approximately five feet from the
property

line. This grading effectively blocked plaintiffs’ use of
the area and plaintiffs commenced this action for injunctive and declaratory
relief.

When the trial court denied plaintiffs’ request for a
preliminary injunction to prevent further construction, defendant proceeded to
erect a

building on the contested area.

After a trial on the merits, the trial court found that
plaintiffs had acquired a 25 foot wide prescriptive easement over and along the
southern

portion of defendant’s property for the full depth of the
property. As noted defendant was ordered to remove that portion of the building
which

interfered with the described easement. Further the trial
court gave defendant 90 days to accomplish the removal and purported to reserve

jurisdiction to award damages for failure of defendant to
comply with the mandatory injunction. This appeal ensued.

The elements necessary to establish a prescriptive easement
are well settled. The party claiming such an easement must show use of the

property which has been open, notorious, continuous and
adverse for an uninterrupted period of five years. Whether the elements of
prescription

are established is a question of fact for the trial court,
and the findings of the court will not be disturbed where there is substantial
evidence to

support them.

#998

Further, the existence of a prescriptive easement must be
shown by a definite and certain line of travel for the statutory period. “The
line of

travel over a roadway which is claimed by prescription may
not be a shifting course, but must be certain and definite. Slight deviations
from the

accustomed route will not defeat an easement, but
substantial changes which break the continuity of the course of travel will
destroy the claim to

prescriptive rights.... [Citations.] [M]anifestly the
distance to which a roadway may be changed without destroying an easement will
be

determined somewhat by the character of the land over which
it passes, together with the value, improvements, and purposes to which the
land is

adapted.” (Matthiessen v. Grand, 268 P. 675, 678 (Cal. Dist.
Ct. App. 1928).)

The trial court found that “the truckers using [the disputed
parcel] did, in fact, follow a definite course and pattern, and while
admittedly, no

two truck drivers followed the exact course... and the
traffic situation... varied from day to day, the deviation taken by various
drivers over the

seven-year period was only slight.”

The evidence revealed that truck drivers who were making
deliveries to or receiving goods from plaintiffs used the parcel to approach
the

building, swing around and back into plaintiffs’ loading
dock. Since the drivers varied in their abilities, the space required to
complete this

[maneuver] was variable. No two drivers followed precisely
the same course, but all used the parcel for the same purpose—to turn their
vehicles

so they could enter plaintiffs’ loading docks. There was
substantial evidence to support the findings on this issue.

Defendant contends that there was no evidence supporting use
of several hundred feet of the westerly portion of the parcel. From the trial

transcript, it is difficult to discern exactly to which
portion of the parcel specific bits of testimony pertain. [ ] [Our review of
the record, however,

discloses substantial evidence supporting the establishment
of a prescriptive easement over the westerly portion at issue.]

Defendant contends that there was no substantial evidence
that plaintiffs’ use of the property was hostile rather than permissive. Again,
we

find that this contention is without merit.

The issue as to which party has the burden of proving
adverse or permissive use has been the subject of much debate. However, [ ] [we

agree with the view, supported by numerous authorities,]
that continuous use of an easement over a long period of time without the
landowner’s

interference is presumptive evidence of its existence and in
the absence of evidence of mere permissive use it will be sufficient to sustain
a

judgment. (MacDonald Properties, Inc. v. Bel-Air Country
Club, [140 Cal.Rptr. 367 (Cal. Ct. App. 1977), and cases cited].)

Defendant relies on evidence that plaintiffs at one time
attempted to purchase the disputed parcel from the seller and at various times

attempted to negotiate for an express easement. Whether the
use is

#999

hostile or is merely a matter of neighborly accommodation,
however, is a question of fact to be determined in light of the surrounding

circumstances and the relationship between the parties.

There was evidence adduced at trial that despite plaintiffs’
unsuccessful attempts to negotiate an express easement, their use of the
property

continued uninterrupted for approximately seven years. There
was no evidence that defendant had ever expressly permitted plaintiffs to use
the

parcel for truck and vehicular traffic. In fact defendant’s
adamant refusal to negotiate on the issue is evidence that no permission was
given or

contemplated.

Defendant’s next assignment of error is addressed to the
trial court’s order to remove that part of the completed structure which
interferes

with plaintiffs’ easement. Defendant argues that a mandatory
injunction may not issue to enjoin a completed act. However, there is extensive

authority standing for the proposition that a court of
equity may, in a proper case, issue a mandatory injunction for protection and
preservation of

an easement including, where appropriate, an order for
removal of an obstruction already erected. The determination as to whether such
remedy

is appropriate is within the sound discretion of the trial
court. A mandatory injunction may issue even if the cost of removal is great
under certain

circumstances, especially if the encroaching structure was
wilfully erected with knowledge of the claimed easement.

As the court in Morgan v. Veach , 139 P.2d 976 (Cal. Dist.
Ct. App. 1943), explained:

An appropriate statement relative to defendants’ assertion
that an injunction would work an inequitable burden is in 28 Am.Jur.,

section 56, page 253 as follows: “In view of the drastic
character of mandatory injunctions, the rule under consideration as to

balancing the relative conveniences of the parties applies
with special force to a prayer for such mandatory relief. Where, therefore, by

innocent mistake or oversight, buildings erected... slightly
encroach... and the damage to the owner of the buildings by their

removal would be greatly disproportionate to the injury...
the court may decline to order their removal.... But relief by way of a

mandatory injunction will not be denied on the ground that
the loss caused by it will be disproportionate to the good accomplished,

where it appears that the defendant acted with a full
knowledge of the complainant’s rights and with an understanding of the

consequences which might ensue... .”

In a note in 57 A.L.R., first column, page 343, it was said:
“Wilfulness on the part of the defendant in proceeding with the violation of

the restriction after warning by the complainant, especially
after suit is brought, is a ground for equitable relief by mandatory

injunction greatly stressed by the courts.” (139 P.2d at
980.)

#1000

In the case at bench, the structure to be removed was not
begun until after the underlying action was filed. It was completed while the

litigation was still pending. Defendant gambled on the
outcome of the action and lost. The fact that its decision may have been
reasonable in light

of the denial of the preliminary injunction does not change
the result. * * * (End of Court of Appeal opinion.)

We next consider whether defendant is entitled to any
offsetting monetary relief from plaintiffs. Defendant contends that the trial
court’s

judgment is overly harsh because it both granted plaintiffs
an easement over a 16,250-square-foot parcel of defendant’s property free of
charge

and also required defendant to incur the entire cost of
relocating or reconstructing its building. Would application of equitable
principles dictate

that plaintiffs either pay to defendant the fair market
value of the easement they acquired, or contribute a portion of the costs of
relocating? We

think not.

Initially, the statutory procedure for acquiring an easement
by prescription quite clearly retains the traditional common law rule that such
an

easement may be obtained without incurring any liability to
the underlying property owner. Civil Code section 1007, enacted in 1872,
provides

that “Occupancy for the period prescribed by the Code of
Civil Procedure as sufficient to bar any action for the recovery of the
property confers

a title thereto, denominated a title by prescription, which
is sufficient against all... .” (Italics added.) We have confirmed that if the
requisite

elements of a prescriptive use are shown, “Such use for the
five-year statutory period of Code of Civil Procedure section 321 confers a
title by

prescription. ” (Taormino v. Denny, 463 P.2d 711, 716 (Cal.
1970) fns. omitted, italics added.)

Thus, plaintiffs herein have acquired a title by
prescription which is “sufficient against all,” including defendant. That being
so, there is no

basis in law or equity for requiring them to compensate
defendant for the fair market value of the easement so acquired. To exact such
a charge

would entirely defeat the legitimate policies underlying the
doctrines of adverse possession and prescription “ ‘to reduce litigation and
preserve

the peace by protecting a possession that has been
maintained for a statutorily deemed sufficient period of time.’ ” (Italics
added, Gilardi v.

Hallam, 636 P.2d 588, 592 (Cal. 1981), quoting from an
earlier case; see also the Restatement of Property, intro. note at pp.
2922–2923; 3

Powell, The Law of Real Property (1981 ed.) ¶ 413, pp.
34–103—34–104.) As described by Professor Powell, “Historically, prescription
has had

the theoretical basis of a lost grant. Its continuance has
been justified because of its functional utility in helping to cause prompt
termination of

controversies before the possible loss of evidence and in
stabilizing long continued property uses.” (Ibid., fn. omitted, italics added.)
If the

doctrine of prescription is truly aimed at “protecting” and
“stabilizing” a long and continuous use or possession as against the claims of
an

alleged “owner”

#1001

of the property, then the latter’s claim for damages or fair
compensation for an alleged “taking” must be rejected.

The Court of Appeal recently described the rationale
underlying the related adverse possession doctrine as follows: “[I]ts
underlying

philosophy is basically that land use has historically been
favored over disuse, and that therefore he who uses land is preferred in the
law to he

who does not, even though the latter is the rightful owner.
[Fn. omitted.] Hence our laws of real property have sanctioned certain types of

otherwise unlawful taking of land belonging to someone else,
while, at the same time, our laws with respect to other types of property have

generally taken a contrary course. This is now largely
justified on the theory that the intent is not to reward the taker or punish
the person

dispossessed, but to reduce litigation and preserve the
peace by protecting a possession that has been maintained for a statutorily
deemed

sufficient period of time.... [¶ ] Quite naturally, however,
dispossessing a person of his property is not easy under this theory, and it
may even

be asked whether the concept of adverse possession is as
viable as it once was, or whether the concept always squares with modern ideals
in a

sophisticated, congested, peaceful society.... [¶ ] Yet this
method of obtaining land remains on the books, and if a party proves all five
of the

[requisite] elements [citation], he can claim title to
another’s land... .” (Finley v. Yuba County Water Dist., 160 Cal.Rptr. 423, 427
(Cal. Ct. App.

1979), italics added.)

Similarly, the system of acquiring an interest in land by
prescription “remains on the books,” and any decision to alter that system by

requiring the payment of compensation clearly would be a
matter for the Legislature. Defendant cites no authorities indicating that the
present

system is unconstitutional in any respect.

Assuming that an award of compensation for the value of the
easement is unavailable, may the courts nonetheless order the easement owner

to contribute all or part of the cost of relocating or
reconstructing an encroaching building? It is at least arguable that a court of
equity could

order, in an appropriate case, that the plaintiff contribute
a portion of the cost of relocating an innocent encroachment, as a condition to
an award

of injunctive relief. As previously noted, it is well
established that a court has discretion to balance the hardships and deny
removal of an

encroachment if it was innocently made and does not
irreparably injure the plaintiff, and where the cost of removal would greatly
exceed the

inconvenience to the plaintiff by its continuance. If, as
the foregoing cases establish, an outright denial of injunctive relief would be
sustained

under those circumstances, then no compelling reason exists
for depriving the trial court of the lesser power of granting the injunction on

condition that the plaintiff pay a reasonable portion of the
cost of relocation. (See Collester v. Oftedahl, 48 Cal.App.2d 756, 760–61 (Cal.
Dist.

Ct. App. 1941) [injunctive relief conditioned upon payment
of costs]; cf. Farmers Ins. Exch. v. Ruiz, 59 Cal.Rptr. 13, 17–18 (Cal. Ct.
App.

1967); 2 Witkin,

#1002

Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1970) Provisional Remedies, § 82, at
p. 1520; 2 Pomeroy’s Equity Jurisprudence (5th ed. 1941) § 385 et seq. [“He who

seeks equity must do equity”].)

In the present case, however, it is apparent that it would
be inequitable to charge plaintiffs, who lawfully perfected an easement by

prescription, for the cost of removing an encroaching
structure erected by defendant with prior notice of plaintiffs’ claim. As
previously noted,

defendant’s building was erected after plaintiffs’ suit was
filed and remained pending. Under similar circumstances, the courts have deemed
an

encroachment to be wilful and have ordered its removal
despite a disproportionate hardship to the defendant. Likewise, plaintiffs
should not be

required to contribute to the cost of relocating encroaching
structures which were erected by defendant with full knowledge of plaintiffs’
claim.

The judgment is affirmed.

■
GRODIN, JUSTICE, concurring. I cannot accept the majority’s attempted
justification for the current law of prescriptive easements. How, in

today’s urban society, litigation is reduced or the peace is
preserved by allowing persons situated as are these plaintiffs to acquire
rights in what is

concededly the land of another without a cent of payment is
beyond my comprehension. I therefore agree entirely with the policy criticisms

contained in Justice Reynoso’s dissenting opinion.

I am persuaded, however, that if change is to come to this
arcane area of the law it should come through the Legislature rather than
through

the courts. It is not alone the existence of Civil Code
section 1007 which persuades me, for as my dissenting colleague observes that
section,

adopted in 1872, was early interpreted as merely fixing the
time within which a right by prescription may be acquired. But, in 1965 the

Legislature modified the harsh application of the
prescriptive easement doctrine by adding Civil Code section 1008, which permits
a property

owner to avoid acquisition of an easement by the simple
expedient of posting a sign.^1 Given that modification, and that degree of
legislative

attention, I would leave the next move to Sacramento. I
therefore join in affirming the trial court’s judgment.

■
REYNOSO, JUSTICE, dissenting. I respectfully dissent from that portion of the
majority opinion which denies compensation of fair market value

for the easement. * * *

Plaintiffs called upon the power of the trial court, acting
in equity, to declare and protect a prescriptive easement. The court agreed.
Yet the

practical result, as indicated by the Court of Appeal
opinion (per Compton, J.), is that: “A simple affirmance of the judgment would
result

#1003

in plaintiffs, who are admittedly trespassers, acquiring
practical possession of a sixteen thousand two hundred fifty (16,250) square
foot parcel of

defendant’s valuable property free of charge... .”

The majority argues that the result, unjust or not, is
ordained by statute. I disagree. My review of the statutes cited by the
majority convinces

me that they have not removed from the courts the
traditional power to invoke the equitable doctrines which deal with fairness.
Those doctrines

persuade me that plaintiffs should pay fair market value for
the property interest acquired. * * *

The law of prescriptive easements and their enforcement
enjoyed a long history at common law before 1872. In that year Civil Code
section

1007 was enacted. It merely codified the general concept of
prescriptive easement found at common law. We must look, therefore, to common

law precepts to resolve the issue at hand.

At common law, the declaration of whether a prescriptive
easement existed was considered an action at law. It remains so. However, the

protection of the declared right was generally considered,
and still is, an action in equity.

Mere citation to Civil Code section 1007 resolves nothing.
The term “title by prescription,” for example, describes the rights which a
person

acquires upon establishing a prescriptive easement. Nothing
more. The case at bench assumes acquisition; the real issue deals with the
conditions

which the court may impose to protect that judicially
declared easement. Thus, in Taormino v. Denny , 463 P.2d 711 (Cal. 1970), cited
by the

majority, our court did no more than affirm the prescriptive
right over a private roadway. Not surprisingly, the parties have not cited the
section

before the trial court, the appellate court, or before us.
Neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeal mentioned it. And no papers
before us

mention the code section. Yet, the section erroneously forms
the basis for the majority opinion. * * *

The Court of Appeal correctly identified the nature of
plaintiff’s cause of action and the issue in this appeal when it wrote: “This
is an

appeal from an equitable decree which declared that
plaintiffs had acquired an easement by prescription over the property of
defendant.”

(Emphasis added.) Neither the parties nor the majority
disagree with that characterization.

We come, therefore, to the power of the court in equity.
Whether the trial court must order the plaintiffs to pay fair market value for
the

prescriptive easement, as the Court of Appeal concluded,
depends on the breadth of discretion which the court in equity enjoys. Let us
briefly

explore the concept of equity.

Equity’s origins lie in the King’s extraordinary judicial
power, exercised through the Chancery, to administer justice whenever “it was

probable that a fair trial in the ordinary Courts would be
impeded, and also whenever,... , the regular administration of justice was
hindered.”

#1004

(5 Pomeroy’s Equity Jurisprudence § 31 P. 37 (1941),
hereinafter Pomeroy.) The Chancellor was obliged to look only to “Honesty,
Equity, and

Conscience [ ]” to decide conflicts. (Id., § 35, p. 40.)
Today, it is only a matter of degree that separates the early Chancellors who
decided

“whether reason and conscience demanded special
intervention... .” (Walsh on Equity, § 53, p. 282 (1930)) from the modern
judges and their

grants of equitable relief. (Id.) The modern judge remains
the repositor of special relief; he stands in the states’ stead “modifying the
rigor of hard

and fast rules at law where reason and conscience demand
it.” (Ibid.) * * *

Traditionally the courts have not imposed a condition that
fair market value be paid before a prescriptive easement will be declared and

protected. However, in my view, the courts do not [sic] have
such power. In the case at bench that power should be exercised.

The role which the court in equity can play is seen in two
disparate examples, one old and one new. First, we look to the traditional case

wherein the building of one owner trespasses upon that of
another. Where the law recognizes a legal wrong in such a trespass, and would

normally order the removal of the encroaching building (as
was done in the case at bench), the court in equity may instead order that
money

damages be paid by the encroaching party as a condition of
protecting the encroachment, particularly where the encroachment was
unintentional.

(See Walsh, § 55, pp. 2 84–85.) Second, I cite a quite
different example which does not deal with property. The courts, pursuant to
their inherent

equitable powers, have created several exceptions to the
statutory rule (Code Civ.Proc., § 1021) which requires each party to pay his or
her own

attorney fees. (See Serrano v. Priest, 569 P.2d 1303,
1306–15 (Cal. 1977).) These examples simply illustrate the not too startling
notion that

courts of equity, in search of fairness, may (1) impose
conditions before a decree protecting rights will issue, (2) grant monetary
damages, and (3)

extend statutory rights. I cite these only to stress that no
reason abides in the history, concept or modern practice of equity which would
so restrict

the power of the court that it could not impose a
requirement that fair market value be paid by the trespasser who is granted a
prescriptive

easement.

Finally, I turn to the fairness issue. By permitting the
prescriptive easement in the case at bench the state, acting through the court,
endorses

a private action akin to eminent domain. Practically, it is
the taking of property rights from defendant and giving them to plaintiff. Can
it be fair

to reward a wrongdoer and punish an innocent property owner?

The majority says “yes.” It is fair, according to the
majority, for several reasons including (1) reducing litigation, (2) protecting
possession,

and (3) preference for use over [disuse] of land. None of
these reasons is convincing. First, no litigation was reduced. Society should
not be in

the business of forcing an owner of land to bring suit when
a trespass has occurred. Such a policy increases litigation. Second, the
possession of

the easement has in fact been protected; plaintiffs are only

#1005

required to pay for the easement. Third, modern society
evidences a preference for planned use, not the ad hoc use of a trespasser. It
is

questionable that in the urban setting of the case at bench,
such use by the trespasser is preferred by society.

I do not rely solely on my personal view of fairness.
Rather, it is my role as a judge, as it was with the chancellor, to apply a
“conception of

justice in accordance with the prevailing reason and
conscience of the time.” (Walsh, § 53 , p. 281.) (See also 5 Pomeroy, Equity
Jurisprudence,

§ 6 7, p. 89 ; “[Equity] is so constructed.. ., that it
possesses an inherent capacity of expansion, so as to keep abreast of each
succeeding

generation and age.”) The final decree of the trial court,
approved by the majority, contravenes today’s basic notions of fairness and
justice. A

requirement that plaintiffs pay fair market value for the
land use given them is the least our society expects. * * *

The suggestion of the concurring opinion that the
Legislature should study this area of law bears underscoring. The statutes need
to reflect

today’s realities. Certainly—they should at least ameliorate
the harsh consequences the majority feels compelled to enforce. However, I note
that

the recent legislative changes referred to in the
concurrence only provide a landowner relief from the creation of a prescriptive
easement. There

remains the need for an equitable avenue by which the courts
may relieve a landowner subject to a prescriptive easement of an otherwise

inequitable burden.

I would affirm the judgment. However, I would remand to the
trial court for further proceedings to fix an amount of reasonable

compensation to be paid by plaintiffs to defendant. That
compensation would be the fair market value of the property interest acquired.
From that

compensation damages, if any, sustained by plaintiff should
be subtracted.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .What is the best characterization of the state of mind of
the plaintiff in _Warsaw_ : good faith, bad faith, or unclear? What state of
mind does the

California Supreme Court seem to require to establish an
easement by prescription?

2 .The opinion recites that to establish an easement by
prescription, the use must be continuous and must follow a “definite course and
pattern.”

More direct issues with the continuity requirement were
raised in _United States v. Platt_ , a case involving the Zuni indigenous
tribe. As a part of their

religious practice, every four years, a maximum of eighty
members of the Zuni tribe go on a 110 - mile pilgrimage on the summer solstice
from their

reservation in northwest New Mexico to a mountain area the
tribe calls Kohlu/wala:wa in northeast Arizona. The Zuni believe that
Kohlu/wala:wa is

“their place of origin, the basis for their religious life,
and the home of their dead.” 730 F. Supp. 318 , 319 (D. Ariz. 1990 ). In 1985 ,
Earl Platt, the owner

of eighteen to twenty miles of the land crossed during the
pilgrimage,

```



1006



```

expressed an intent to interfere with future crossings. The
Arizona district court determined that, although the crossing occurs on one day
once every

four years, the Zuni had established an easement by
prescription over Platt’s land, noting that the pilgrimage extended at least
back to the early twentieth

century, that the route remained “consistent and relatively
unchanged,” that their claim to ongoing use was evidenced by their cutting down
of fences in

their way, and that the practice was “open visible and known
to the community.” Id. at 320 – 24. In what ways does this approach to the
continuity

requirement for prescriptive easements remind you of the
treatment of that requirement in adverse possession cases like _Scott v.
Anderson-Tully Co._ or

_Howard v. Kunto_ (see Chapter II)?

3 .What do you think of the idea of requiring the adverse
user (AU) (or adverse possessor, AP) to pay the true owner (TO) the fair market
value of

the easement (or the possessory rights) obtained through
prescription or adverse possession? The standard rules of prescription and
adverse possession

involve what Calabresi and Melamed call property rules. One
day before the statute of limitations runs, the TO has the entitlement
protected by a

property rule. This means the TO can block the AU or AP from
further using the property without the TO’s consent. The day after the statute
of

limitations runs, the AU or AP has the entitlement, also
protected by a property rule. This means that the AU or AP can now use
self-help or otherwise

stop the TO (or any other person) from interfering with her
use right or possessory right without her consent. The innovation embraced by
the California

Court of Appeal, but rejected by a majority of the
California Supreme Court, would mean that the passage of the statute of
limitations would transform

an entitlement in the TO protected by a property rule into
an entitlement in the TO protected by a liability rule. In other words, the AU
or AP could in

effect force a transfer of use rights or possessory rights
by the TO, but only upon payment of just compensation to the TO.

4 .Another way to frame the question would be to ask whether
we should consider the successful AU to have been unjustly enriched, giving
rise to

a claim of restitution. Is there any way to tell whether the
AU is unjustly enriched other than by reference to the legal entitlement? Which
is what?

(Consider in this regard that one who pays by mistake an
unenforceable debt cannot sue to get the payment back, and promising to pay a
debt that is past

the statute of limitations will cause the statute to start
over.) Does Justice Reynoso’s invocation of traditional equity support a
restitution theory?

Whether or not you agree with the idea of indemnification or
restitution by one claiming prescription (or adverse possession), do you think
an

indemnification requirement would make more sense, or less
sense, in the context of an irrevocable license by estoppel, as in _Holbrook v.
Taylor_ , the

next case?

5 .As in a number of other California cases we have
considered ( _Moore v. Regents of the University of California_ , _Intel Corp.
v. Hamidi_ , _Marvin v.

Marvin_ , _Kendall v. Ernest Pestana_ , _Nahrstedt v.
Lakeside Village Condominium_ ) the debate among the Justices here centers on
the question of

institutional choice: Which institution, legislature or
court, is primarily responsible for updating property law? Here all but one of
the Justices thinks

```



1007



```

the legislature must do the updating. But is the proposal
here really all that radical? Why isn’t the defendant simply in the position of
one seeking

restitution for unjust enrichment (see Chapter IV)?

Figure 9-5

Land at Issue in Warsaw v. Chicago Metallic Ceilings

6 .Under the liability rule regime endorsed by the Court of
Appeal, what happens if the TO has abandoned the property or cannot be located
to

receive the payment of compensation? At what point in time
would the property taken be valued—at the point of original entry or use, when
the statute

of limitations runs, or when the judgment awarding title to
the AP (or ownership of an easement to the AU) becomes final? How would the
shift from a

property rule in the AU or AP to a liability rule in the TO
affect the incentives of the parties to monitor for trespasses and negotiate
written easements

when appropriate? Would you allow compensation in all cases,
or only in certain kinds of cases, e.g., where the original entry was in bad
faith? For

discussion of these issues, see Thomas W. Merrill, Property
Rules, Liability Rules, and Adverse Possession, 79 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1123 ( 1985
).

■
STERNBERG, JUSTICE. This is an action to establish a right to the use of a
roadway, which is 10 to 12 feet wide and about 250 feet long, over the

unenclosed, hilly woodlands of another. The claimed right to
the use of the roadway is twofold: by prescription and by estoppel. Both issues
are

heatedly contested. The evidence is in conflict as to the
nature and type of use that had been made of the roadway. The lower court
determined

that a right to the use of the roadway by prescription had
not been

#1008

established, but that it had been established by estoppel.
The landowners, feeling themselves aggrieved, appeal. We will consider the two
issues

separately.

In Grinestaff v. Grinestaff , 318 S.W.2d 881 (Ky. 1958), we
said that an easement may be created by express written grant, by implication,
by

prescription, or by estoppel. It has long been the law of
this commonwealth that “(a)n easement, such as a right of way, is created when
the

owner of a tenement to which the right is claimed to be
appurtenant, or those under whom he claims title, have openly, peaceably,
continuously,

and under a claim of right adverse to the owner of the soil,
and with his knowledge and acquiescence, used a way over the lands of another
for as

much as 15 years.” Flener v. Lawrence, 220 S.W. 1041 (Ky.
1920); Rominger v. City Realty Company, 324 S.W.2d 806 (Ky. 1959).

In 1942 appellants purchased the subject property. In 1944
they gave permission for a haul road to be cut for the purpose of moving coal

from a newly opened mine. The roadway was so used until
1949, when the mine closed. During that time the appellants were paid a royalty
for

the use of the road. In 1957 appellants built a tenant house
on their property and the roadway was used by them and their tenant. The tenant

house burned in 1961 and was not replaced. In 1964 the
appellees bought their three-acre building site, which adjoins appellants, and
the

following year built their residence thereon. At all times
prior to 1965, the use of the haul road was by permission of appellants. There
is no

evidence of any probative value which would indicate that
the use of the haul road during that period of time was either adverse,
continuous, or

uninterrupted. The trial court was fully justified,
therefore, in finding that the right to the use of this easement was not
established by

prescription.

As to the issue on estoppel, we have long recognized that a
right to the use of a roadway over the lands of another may be established by

estoppel. In Lashley Telephone Co. v. Durbin , 228 S.W. 423
(Ky. 1921), we said:

Though many courts hold that a licensee is conclusively
presumed as a matter of law to know that a license is revocable at the pleasure

of the licensor, and if he expend money in connection with
his entry upon the land of the latter, he does so at his peril * * * , yet it
is

the established rule in this state that where a license is
not a bare, naked right of entry, but includes the right to erect structures
and

acquire an interest in the land in the nature of an easement
by the construction of improvements thereon, the licensor may not revoke

the license and restore his premises to their former
condition after the licensee has exercised the privilege given by the license
and

erected the improvements at considerable expense; * * *

#1009

In Gibbs v. Anderson , 156 S.W.2d 876 (Ky. 1941), Gibbs
claimed the right, by estoppel, to the use of a roadway over the lands of
Anderson.

The lower court denied the claim. We reversed. Anderson’s
immediate predecessor in title admitted that he had discussed the passway with
Gibbs

before it was constructed and had agreed that it might be
built through his land. He stood by and saw Gibbs expend considerable money in
this

construction. We applied the rule announced in Lashley
Telephone Co. v. Durbin , supra, and reversed with directions that a judgment
be entered

granting Gibbs the right to the use of the passway.

In McCoy v. Hoffman , 295 S.W.2d 560 (Ky. 1956), the facts
are that Hoffman had acquired the verbal consent of the landowner to build a

passway over the lands of the owner to the state highway.
Subsequently, the owner of the servient estate sold the property to McCoy, who
at the

time of the purchase was fully aware of the existence of the
roadway and the use to which it was being put. McCoy challenged Hoffman’s right

to use the road. The lower court found that a right had been
gained by prescription. In this court’s consideration of the case, we affirmed,
not on

the theory of prescriptive right but on the basis that the
owner of the servient estate was estopped. After announcing the rule for
establishing a

right by prescription, we went on to say:

* * * On the other hand, the right of revocation of the
      license is subject to the qualification that where the licensee has exercised
      the

privilege given him and erected improvements or made
substantial expenditures on the faith or strength of the license, it becomes

irrevocable and continues for so long a time as the nature
of the license calls for. In effect, under this condition the license becomes
in

reality a grant through estoppel. * * *.

In Akers v. Moore , 309 S.W.2d 758 (Ky. 1958), this court
again considered the right to the use of a passway by estoppel. Akers and
others

had used the Moore branch as a public way of ingress and
egress from their property. They sued Moore and others who owned property along
the

branch seeking to have the court recognize their right to
the use of the roadway and to order the removal of obstructions which had been
placed

in the roadway. The trial court found that Akers and others
had acquired a prescriptive right to the use of the portion of the road lying
on the left

side of the creek bed, but had not acquired the right to the
use of so much of the road as lay on the right side of the creek bed.
Consequently, an

appeal and a cross-appeal were filed. Considering the right
to the use of the strip of land between the right side of the creek bed and the
highway,

this court found that the evidence portrayed it very rough
and apparently never improved, that it ran alongside the house in which one of
the

protestors lived, and that by acquiescence or by express
consent of at least one of the protestors the right side of the roadway was
opened up so as

to change the roadway from its close proximity to the Moore
residence. The relocated portion of the highway had only been used as a passway

for about six years before the suit was filed. The trial

#1010

court found that this section of the road had not been
established as a public way by estoppel. We reversed. In doing so, we stated:

We consider the fact that the appellees, Artie Moore, et al.
had stood by and acquiesced in (if in fact they had not affirmatively

consented) the change being made and permitted the
appellants to spend money in fixing it up to make it passable and use it for
six

years without objecting. Of course, the element of time was
not sufficient for the acquisition of the right of way by adverse possession.

But the law recognizes that one may acquire a license to use
a passway or roadway where, with the knowledge of the licensor, he has

in the exercise of the privilege spent money in improving
the way or for other purposes connected with its use on the faith or strength

of the license. Under such conditions the license becomes
irrevocable and continues for so long a time as its nature calls for. This, in

effect, becomes a grant through estoppel. Gibbs v. Anderson,
288 Ky. 488, 156 S.W.2d 876 (Ky. 1941); McCoy v. Hoffman, Ky., 295

S.W.2d 560 (Ky. 1956). It would be unconscionable to permit
the owners of this strip of land of trivial value to revoke the license by

obstructing and preventing its use.

In the present case the roadway had been used since 1944 by
permission of the owners of the servient estate. The evidence is conflicting as

to whether the use of the road subsequent to 1965 was by
permission or by claim of right. Appellees contend that it had been used by
them and

others without the permission of appellants; on the other
hand, it is contended by appellants that the use of the roadway at all times
was by their

permission. The evidence discloses that during the period of
preparation for the construction of appellees’ home and during the time the
house

was being built, appellees were permitted to use the roadway
as ingress and egress for workmen, for hauling machinery and material to the

building site, for construction of the dwelling, and for
making improvements generally to the premises. Further, the evidence reflects
that after

construction of the residence, which cost $25,000, was
completed, appellees continued to regularly use the roadway as they had been
doing.

Appellant J. S. Holbrook testified that in order for
appellees to get up to their house he gave them permission to use and repair
the roadway. They

widened it, put in a culvert, and graveled part of it with
“red dog”, also known as cinders, at a cost of approximately $100. There is no
other

location over which a roadway could reasonably be built to
provide an outlet for appellees.

No dispute had arisen between the parties at any time over
the use of the roadway until the fall of 1970. Appellant J. S. Holbrook
contends

that he wanted to secure a writing from the appellees in
order to relieve him from any responsibility for any damage that might happen
to anyone

on the subject road. On the other hand, Mrs. Holbrook
testified that the writing was desired to avoid any claim which may be made by
appellees

#1011

of a right to the use of the roadway. Appellees testified
that the writing was an effort to force them to purchase a small strip of land
over which

the roadway traversed, for the sum of $500. The dispute was
not resolved and appellants erected a steel cable across the roadway to prevent
its

use and also constructed “no-trespassing” signs. Shortly
thereafter, the suit was filed to require the removal of the obstruction and to
declare the

right of appellees to the use of the roadway without
interference.

The use of the roadway by appellees to get to their home
from the public highway, the use of the roadway to take in heavy equipment and

material and supplies for construction of the residence, the
general improvement of the premises, the maintenance of the roadway, and the

construction by appellees of a $25,000 residence, all with
the actual consent of appellants or at least with their tacit approval, clearly

demonstrates the rule laid down in Lashley Telephone Co. v.
Durbin , supra, that the license to use the subject roadway may not be revoked.

The evidence justifies the finding of the lower court that
the right to the use of the roadway had been established by estoppel.

The judgment is affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .By extinguishing the title of true owner (TO), adverse
possession leads to the same result as a transfer of full possessory rights of
ownership

from the original true owner (TO) to the adverse possessor
(AP), after the statute of limitations runs (provided the other elements of
adverse possession

are satisfied—see Chapter II). An easement by prescription
mimics the transfer of an easement over the land of the TO to the adverse user
(AU), after

the statute of limitations runs. How does one know whether
the behavior of the adverse party constitutes adverse possession or adverse
use? Suppose in

_Holbrook_ that the appellees and their predecessors had
parked vehicles overnight on the roadway. Would this transform a prescriptive
easement case into

an adverse possession case? Why doesn’t placing the “red
dog” on the driveway make this adverse possession rather than prescription?

2 .Recall that the five standard elements for establishing
adverse possession are that the possession must be ( 1 ) actual, ( 2 )
exclusive, ( 3 ) open and

notorious, ( 4 ) continuous, and ( 5 ) adverse under a claim
of right. Which of these elements are relaxed or modified in establishing an
easement by

prescription?

3 .It would appear that prescription requires lack of
permission and that estoppel requires permission, or at least acquiescence
(coupled with

reliance). Why? Although modern easements by prescription
closely track adverse possession, this was not always the case. An older
theory, now less in

favor, rested prescription on the fiction of a “lost grant”:
The running of the prescriptive period raises an irrebuttable presumption that
sometime in the

past the owner of the servient land granted an easement
(satisfying the statute of frauds) but that the grant was lost. See, e.g.,
Shellow v. Hagen,

```



1012



```

101 N.W. 2 d 694 , 696 – 97 (Wis. 1960 ); Romans v. Nadler,
14 N.W. 2 d 482 , 485 (Minn. 1944 ); Bryant v. Foot, ( 1867 ) 2 L.R.–Q.B. 161 ,
181 (Eng.).

Although this fiction has been much criticized, see
Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes) § 2. 17 cmt. b ( 2000 ), it does
raise the question whether

the acquisition of an easement by prescription should be
associated with an adverse stance by the potential acquirer. Would allowing the
acquisition of

an easement after accommodating behavior foster neighborly
behavior? How do (and should) potential servient owners protect themselves from
claims

of prescription or estoppel?

4 .If an encroaching user obtains an easement by
prescription, this results in a perpetual easement in all respects equivalent
to an easement by

grant. What rights are established when the encroaching user
obtains an irrevocable license by estoppel? Does an irrevocable license run
with the land?

Does it create rights enforceable against third parties? The
court in the principal case quotes an earlier Kentucky decision, which says the
interest

“continues for so long as its nature calls for.” What does
this mean?

5 .Suppose landowner A, knowing where the lot line is,
observes neighboring landowner B building a driveway over the land of owner A.

Landowner B does not know he is trespassing and in fact
thinks the driveway is on his own land. If landowner A simply watches the
construction day

after day without giving any permission, express or implied,
to use his land for the driveway, and landowner B proceeds to complete the
driveway, can

landowner B claim an irrevocable license by estoppel?

6 .Why does the law have so many different doctrines for
bailing out owners of dominant tracts of land who fail to negotiate a written
grant of an

easement from the owner(s) of servient tracts? Can you think
of ways of reducing the number of doctrines? Would you advocate replacing them
all with

something like the private condemnation statutes in use in
about half the states?

Inc.

District Court of Appeal of Florida, Third District, 1959.



114 So. 2 d 357.



```

■ PER
CURIAM. This is an interlocutory appeal from an order temporarily enjoining the
appellants from continuing with the construction of a

fourteen-story addition to the Fontainebleau Hotel, owned
and operated by the appellants. Appellee, plaintiff below, owns the Eden Roc
Hotel,

which was constructed in 1955, about a year after the
Fontainebleau, and adjoins the Fontainebleau on the north. Both are luxury
hotels, facing

the Atlantic Ocean. The proposed addition to the
Fontainebleau is being constructed twenty feet from its north property line,
130 feet from the

mean high water mark of the Atlantic Ocean, and 76 feet 8
inches from the ocean bulkhead line. The 14-story tower will extend 160 feet
above

grade in height and is 416 feet long from east to west.
During the winter months, from around two o’clock in the afternoon for the
remainder of

the

#1013

day, the shadow of the addition will extend over the cabana,
swimming pool, and sunbathing areas of the Eden Roc, which are located in the

southern portion of its property.

In this action, plaintiff-appellee sought to enjoin the
defendants-appellants from proceeding with the construction of the addition to
the

Fontainebleau (it appears to have been roughly eight stories
high at the time suit was filed), alleging that the construction would
interfere with

the light and air on the beach in front of the Eden Roc and
cast a shadow of such size as to render the beach wholly unfitted for the use
and

enjoyment of its guests, to the irreparable injury of the
plaintiff; further, that the construction of such addition on the north side of
defendants’

property, rather than the south side, was actuated by malice
and ill will on the part of the defendants’ president toward the plaintiff’s
president;

and that the construction was in violation of a building
ordinance requiring a 100-foot setback from the ocean. It was also alleged that
the

construction would interfere with the easements of light and
air enjoyed by plaintiff and its predecessors in title for more than twenty
years and

“impliedly granted by virtue of the acts of the plaintiff’s
predecessors in title, as well as under the common law and the express
recognition of

such rights by virtue of Chapter 9837, Laws of Florida 1923

* * * .” Some attempt was also made to allege an easement by implication in
      favor

of the plaintiff’s property, as the dominant, and against
the defendants’ property, as the servient, tenement.

The defendants’ answer denied the material allegations of
the complaint, pleaded laches and estoppel by judgment.

The chancellor heard considerable testimony on the issues
made by the complaint and the answer and, as noted, entered a temporary

injunction restraining the defendants from continuing with
the construction of the addition. His reason for so doing was stated by him, in
a

memorandum opinion, as follows:

In granting the temporary injunction in this case the Court
wishes to make several things very clear. The ruling is not based on any

alleged presumptive title nor prescriptive right of the
plaintiff to light and air nor is it based on any deed restrictions nor
recorded plats

in the title of the plaintiff nor of the defendant nor of
any plat of record. It is not based on any zoning ordinance nor on any
provision

of the building code of the City of Miami Beach nor on the
decision of any court, nisi prius or appellate. It is based solely on the

proposition that no one has a right to use his property to
the injury of another. In this case it is clear from the evidence that the

proposed use by the Fontainebleau will materially damage the
Eden Roc. There is evidence indicating that the construction of the

proposed annex by the Fontainebleau is malicious or
deliberate for the purpose of injuring the Eden Roc, but it is scarcely
sufficient,

standing alone, to afford a basis for equitable relief.

#1014

This is indeed a novel application of the maxim sic utere
tuo ut alienum non laedas. This maxim does not mean that one must never use his

own property in such a way as to do any injury to his
neighbor. Beckman v. Marshall, 85 So.2d 552 (Fla. 1956). It means only that one
must use

his property so as not to injure the lawful rights of
another. Cason v. Florida Power Co., 76 So. 535 (Fla. 1918). In Reaver v.
Martin Theatres, 52

So.2d 682, 683 (Fla. 1951), under this maxim, it was stated
that “it is well settled that a property owner may put his own property to any

reasonable and lawful use, so long as he does not thereby
deprive the adjoining landowner of any right of enjoyment of his property which
is

recognized and protected by law, and so long as his use is
not such a one as the law will pronounce a nuisance.” [Emphasis supplied.]

No American decision has been cited, and independent
research has revealed none, in which it has been held that—in the absence of
some

contractual or statutory obligation—a landowner has a legal
right to the free flow of light and air across the adjoining land of his
neighbor. Even

at common law, the landowner had no legal right, in the
absence of an easement or uninterrupted use and enjoyment for a period of 20
years, to

unobstructed light and air from the adjoining land. Blumberg
v. Weiss, 17 A.2d 823 (N.J. 1941); 1 Am.Jur., Adjoining Landowners, § 51. And

the English doctrine of “ancient lights” has been
unanimously repudiated in this country. 1 Am.Jur., Adjoining Landowners, § 49,
p. 533; Lynch

v. Hill, 6 A.2d 614 (Del. Ch. 1939), overruling Clawson v.
Primrose, 4 Del.Ch. 643 (1873).

There being, then, no legal right to the free flow of light
and air from the adjoining land, it is universally held that where a structure
serves a

useful and beneficial purpose, it does not give rise to a
cause of action, either for damages or for an injunction under the maxim sic
utere tuo ut

alienum non laedas, even though it causes injury to another
by cutting off the light and air and interfering with the view that would
otherwise be

available over adjoining land in its natural state,
regardless of the fact that the structure may have been erected partly for
spite.

We see no reason for departing from this universal rule. If,
as contended on behalf of plaintiff, public policy demands that a landowner in

the Miami Beach area refrain from constructing buildings on
his premises that will cast a shadow on the adjoining premises, an amendment of
its

comprehensive planning and zoning ordinance, applicable to
the public as a whole, is the means by which such purpose should be achieved.
(No

opinion is expressed here as to the validity of such an
ordinance, if one should be enacted pursuant to the requirements of law. Cf.
City of Miami

Beach v. State ex rel. Fontainebleau Hotel Corp., 108 So.2d
614, 619 (Fla. App. 1959).) But to change the universal rule—and the custom

followed in this state since its inception—that adjoining
landowners have an equal right under the law to build to the line of their
respective tracts

and to such a height as is desired by them (in the absence,
of course, of building restrictions or regulations) amounts, in our

#1015

opinion, to judicial legislation. As stated in Musumeci v.
Leonardo, [75 A.2d 177 (R.I. 1950)], “So use your own as not to injure
another’s

property is, indeed, a sound and salutary principle for the
promotion of justice, but it may not and should not be applied so as
gratuitously to

confer upon an adjacent property owner incorporeal rights
incidental to his ownership of land which the law does not sanction.”

We have also considered whether the order here reviewed may
be sustained upon any other reasoning, conformable to and consistent with

the pleadings, regardless of the erroneous reasoning upon
which the order was actually based. We have concluded that it cannot.

The record affirmatively shows that no statutory basis for
the right sought to be enforced by plaintiff exists. The so-called Shadow

Ordinance enacted by the City of Miami Beach at plaintiff’s
behest was held invalid in City of Miami Beach v. State ex rel. Fontainebleau
Hotel

Corp., supra. It also affirmatively appears that there is no
possible basis for holding that plaintiff has an easement for light and air,
either express

or implied, across defendants’ property, nor any
prescriptive right thereto—even if it be assumed, arguendo, that the common-law
right of

prescription as to “ancient lights” is in effect in this
state. And from what we have said heretofore in this opinion, it is perhaps
superfluous to add

that we have no desire to dissent from the unanimous holding
in this country repudiating the English doctrine of ancient lights.

The only other possible basis—and, in fact, the only one
insisted upon by plaintiff in its brief filed here, other than its reliance
upon the law

of private nuisance as expressed in the maxim sic utere tuo
ut alienum non laedas —for the order here reviewed is the alleged violation by

defendants of the setback line prescribed by ordinance. The
plaintiff argues that the ordinance applicable to the Use District in which
plaintiff’s

and defendants’ properties are located, prescribing “a front
yard having a depth of not less than one hundred (100) feet, measured from the
ocean,

* * * ,” should be and has been interpreted by the City’s
      zoning inspector as requiring a setback of 100 feet from an established ocean
      bulkhead

line. As noted above, the addition to the Fontainebleau is
set back only 76 feet 8 inches from the ocean bulkhead line, although it is 130
feet from

the ocean measured from the mean high water mark.

While the chancellor did not decide the question of whether
the setback ordinance had been violated, it is our view that, even if there was

such a violation, the plaintiff would have no cause of
action against the defendants based on such violation. The application of
simple

mathematics to the sun studies filed in evidence by
plaintiff in support of its claim demonstrates conclusively that to move the
existing structure

back some 23 feet from the ocean would make no appreciable
difference in the problem which is the subject of this controversy. The
construction

#1017

of the 14-story addition is proceeding under a permit issued
by the city pursuant to the mandate of this court in City of Miami Beach v.
State ex

rel. Fontainebleau Hotel Corp., supra, which permit
authorizes completion of the 14-story addition according to a plan showing a
76-foot setback

from the ocean bulkhead line. Moreover, the plaintiff’s
objection to the distance of the structure from the ocean appears to have been
made for

the first time in the instant suit, which was filed almost a
year after the beginning of the construction of the addition, at a time when it
was

roughly eight stories in height, representing the
expenditure by defendants of several million dollars. In these circumstances,
it is our view that

the plaintiff has stated no cause of action for equitable
relief based on the violation of the ordinance—assuming, arguendo, that there
has been a

violation.

Since it affirmatively appears that the plaintiff has not
established a cause of action against the defendants by reason of the structure
here in

question, the order granting a temporary injunction should
be and it is hereby reversed with directions to dismiss the complaint.

Reversed with directions.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The Fontainebleau, designed by architect Morris Lapidus,
was the premier hotel of Miami Beach when it was constructed. It was originally

owned by two partners, Ben Novack and Harry Mufson. When
they had a falling out, Mufson proceeded to build the Eden Roc, immediately to
the north

of the Fontainebleau. Novack retaliated by ordering an
addition, called the Fontainebleau Towers, on the site of the “kit kat”
swimming pool, which was

originally north of the main pool and hence abutted the Eden
Roc property. This is the addition at issue in the principal case. When it was
completed, the

Towers nearly doubled the capacity of the Fontainebleau (to
1 , 000 rooms). Not only did the Towers cast a shadow on the Eden Roc swimming
pool,

Novack also ordered that the north wall of the addition,
facing the Eden Roc, remain windowless and unpainted, thereby degrading the
view of the Eden

Roc patrons—though some sources say the wall retained some
windows in Novack’s own special suite, where he could look down on the shadow
his

structure cast. However, after Mufson was defeated in his
attempt to enjoin the addition, he was able to extend the deck of the Eden Roc,
with a new

pool, further to the east, thereby escaping the shadow cast
in the winter months by the Towers. See Seth Bramson, Miami Beach 106 , 108 (
2005 ). In

2008 , the owners of the Eden Roc remodeled their hotel to
build a twenty-one-story tower alongside the border with the Fontainebleau,
thereby bringing

the longstanding battle started by Novack and Mufson to an
end. See Joseph Brown, Eden Roc Hotel Miami Beach: A New Tower that Ends the
Feud,

South Beach Magazine, Jan. 9 , 2008 , at https://

2 .Is there a simple explanation for the conclusion in
_Fontainebleau Hotel_ that one cannot create an easement by prescription in the
flow of

sunlight across land? A prescriptive easement arises when an
adverse user

```



1018



```

repeatedly trespasses on the land of the true owner, and the
true owner allows the statute of limitations for an action in trespass to run.
Where is the

trespass in _Fontainebleau Hotel_?

3 .Can one obtain an easement by grant for the flow of
sunlight across a neighbor’s property? Some jurisdictions have said yes. See,
e.g., Pacifica

Homeowners’ Ass’n v. Wesley Palms Retirement Community, 224
Cal.Rptr. 380 (Cal. Ct. App. 1986 ); Pierce v. Northeast Lake Washington Sewer
and

Water Dist., 870 P. 2 d 305 (Wash. 1994 ). But the most
common way of providing for something like the flow of sunlight across land
(other than through

zoning ordinances) would be through negotiation of a
restrictive covenant that limits the height of the neighboring building.
Interestingly, one cannot

obtain a restrictive covenant by prescription. The simple
explanation, again, would be that the conduct required by the typical
restrictive covenant does

not involve any trespass by the benefited property owner on
the land of the burdened property owner. Similarly, no state’s common law
provides for a

right to acquire an easement of light by prescription. Might
some form of liability rule be applied in this context? Iowa has passed a
statute that allows

something like a solar easement by private eminent domain,
with ex ante application to a public official and a requirement of just
compensation. Iowa

Code §§ 564 A. See generally Sara C. Bronin, Solar Rights,
89 B.U. L. Rev. 1217 ( 2009 ); Troy A. Rule, Shadows on the Cathedral: Solar
Access Laws

in a Different Light, 2010 U. Ill. L. Rev. 851.

4 .But here is a complication: In England and in most
American jurisdictions, one can acquire by grant an easement to commit a
nuisance on the

land of another. For example, if A wants to construct a
smelly smelter on his land, but anticipates that this will create a nuisance
for B who lives next

door, A can try to acquire an easement from B permitting A
to cast smelly fumes on the land of B. (Of course, A will have to pay dearly
for such an

easement.) Also, as noted earlier, in England, and in some
American states, one can also acquire an easement by prescription to commit a
nuisance. See

Campbell v. Seaman, supra. Thus, if A builds a smelter that
casts smelly fumes on the land of B, and the statute of limitations for B to
bring a nuisance

action against A runs, A can claim to have acquired an
easement by prescription to create the nuisance. If one can acquire an easement
by prescription to

commit a nuisance on the land of a neighbor in the form of
smelly fumes, why cannot one acquire an easement by prescription to be free of
having the

flow of sunlight blocked by a neighbor’s building? Courts
have generally rejected claims that blocking solar access is a nuisance. See
Sher v.

Leiderman, 226 Cal.Rptr. 698 (Cal. Ct. App. 1986 ); American
Nat’l Bank & Trust Co. v. City of Chicago, 568 N.E. 2 d 25 (Ill. App. Ct.
1990 ). However,

two jurisdictions have ruled to the contrary, holding that
blocking sunlight can be a nuisance. See Tenn v. 889 Associates, Ltd., 500 A. 2
d 366 (N.H.

1985 ) (Souter, J.); Prah v. Maretti, 321 N.W. 2 d 182 (Wis.
1982 ). In such a jurisdiction, would _Fontainebleau Hotel_ come out
differently?

5 .In the case of the smelly fumes, the put-upon landowner
has had its attention drawn to the adverse use. Can the same be said for
someone whose

neighbor claims later to have been relying on access to
sunlight? If

```



1019



```

one accepts that blocking light could be a nuisance, how
should a court resolve the conflict? Can any landowner with a worthy project
acquire rights

over adjacent land with no notice? If not, how should
nuisance law evolve in response to changing conditions?

6 .As we saw in Chapter III, many Western states employ the
doctrine of prior appropriation to allocate water, and some Western states have

adopted legislation providing for prior appropriation rights
in solar access, N.M. Stats. §§ 47 – 3 – 1 to 42 – 3 – 5 ; Wyoming Stat. § 34 –
22 – 101 , et seq.; see

also Note, The Allocation of Sunlight: Solar Rights and the
Prior Appropriation Doctrine, 47 Colo. L. Rev. 421 ( 1976 ). Does a “me first”
approach to

solar collectors make sense? If the plaintiff had prevailed
in _Fontainebleau Hotel_ , would there be a potential for a wasteful race to
build? If building and

maintaining a swimming pool restricts the rights of the
neighboring landowner, would each of the landowners be encouraged to build more
quickly than

they would otherwise? Is this a situation in which
first-in-time should prevail, or one where its dangers of wasteful racing are
prominent?

7 .The court in _Fontainebleau Hotel_ states that it does
not matter whether the addition to the Fontainebleau may have been constructed
partly out

of spite. But pure spite can sometimes lead to greater
intervention. Particularly where one landowner erects a fence solely to block
light and air from a

neighbor, many courts have been willing to find a nuisance
and issue an injunction. See, e.g., Flaherty v. Moran, 45 N.W. 381 (Mich. 1890
). Mixed

motives will usually lead to no liability. See, e.g.,
Kuzniak v. Kozminski, 65 N.W. 275 (Mich. 1895 ). See also Nadav Shoked, Two
Hundred Years of

Spite, 110 Nw. U. L. Rev. 357 ( 2016 ). Compare in this
regard _Keeble v. Hickeringill_ , in Chapter II. Might the spite fence doctrine
be a solution to the

problem of a landowner seeking to use the _ad coelum_ rule
to exclude highflying airplanes?

c.TERMINATION OF EASEMENTS

Easements may be terminated in a number of ways. The most
approved method is by deed, releasing or extinguishing the easement.

Easements are also terminated as a matter of law when the
dominant and servient tract come under common ownership. This is said to result
in a

merger of the easement into the larger fee simple. A third
method of termination is adverse possession or prescription. If the owner of
the

servient tract blocks the easement, and the owner of the
dominant tract fails to object before the statute of limitations runs, then the
easement will

be extinguished. Finally, easements may be extinguished if
prolonged nonuse gives rise to an inference that the easement has been
abandoned.

However, changed circumstances are generally not considered
a ground for modification or termination of an easement, unless the easement is

stated in terms of a particular purpose that has become
obsolete. See Jon W. Bruce & James W. Ely, Jr., The Law of Easements and
Licenses in

Land § 9.03 (1988).

#1020

Abandonment of railroad rights-of-way has given rise to
extensive litigation under the Rails-to-Trails Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1247(d),
adopted in

1983. The Act provides a mechanism whereby rail lines that
      are scheduled to be abandoned can be taken over for public use as recreational
      trails.

Many landowners who live next to these lines object. They
argue that railroad rights-of-way were often established as easements for
“railroad

purposes,” and when the easement ceases to be used for
railroad purposes, the land should revert to them, as servient owners under
these original

easements. The owners argue that if the government insists
on converting the easements into public recreational trails, this constitutes a
taking of

their property for which they are entitled to just
compensation. In Preseault v. ICC , 494 U.S. 1 (1990), the Supreme Court upheld
the

constitutionality of the Rails-to-Trails Act, but also
recognized that servient landowners might have a claim for a taking based on
the language of

the particular deeds authorizing railroad operations over
their property. Later decisions have established that resolution of such a
takings claim

requires courts to interpret the nature of the property
interest originally acquired by the railroad (easement or fee simple); the
scope of the interest

acquired by the railroad (unrestricted or limited to
railroad purposes); and when the railroad abandoned the property. For recent
decisions

adjudicating specific disputes involving rails-to-trails
projects, see, Samuel C. Johnson 1988 Trust v. Bayfield County Wisconsin, 649
F.3d 799

(7th Cir. 201 1); Thompson v. United States, No. 09-612L,
2011 WL 4914782 (Fed. Cl. 201 1); see also Marvin M. Brandt Revocable Trust v.

United States, 572 U.S. 93 (2014) (holding that railroad
right of way was an easement, which when abandoned was extinguished, leaving an

unburdened fee simple).

d.MISUSE OF EASEMENTS

#### Penn Bowling Recreation Center, Inc. v. Hot Shoppes,

Inc.

```



United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia
Circuit, 1949.



179 F. 2 d 64.



```

■
MCALLISTER, CIRCUIT JUDGE. In 1938, the Norment Estate conveyed a portion of
its real property to appellee, Hot Shoppes, Inc., and subjected

a part thereof to a sixteen-foot right of way for ingress
and egress. This resulted in an easement for the benefit of the balance of the
unconveyed

property, adjacent thereto, which was retained by the
Estate, and which, by virtue of the easement, became the dominant tenement. A
part of this

dominant estate came into ownership of appellant, Penn
Bowling Recreation Center, Inc., by mesne conveyances, in 1940, two years after
the

creation of the right of way.

On February 5, 1948, appellee, Hot Shoppes, erected a
barrier of iron posts and cement concrete blocks within the right of way and

alongside it, interfering with the full enjoyment of the
easement by Penn Bowling;

#1021

and shortly thereafter, appellant filed its complaint to
enjoin appellee from maintaining the structure within the right of way and
interfering with

the use thereof. Appellee, in its answer denied that
appellant was entitled to the use of the right of way, and asked for a
permanent injunction

against such use by appellant, as well as for a judgment
declaring it to be permanently forfeited and extinguished by abandonment. Both
parties

filed motions for a preliminary injunction, but before a
hearing was had on these motions, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment,
asking

dismissal of the complaint, a permanent injunction against
the use by appellant of the right of way, and a declaratory judgment declaring
that it

had been permanently forfeited and extinguished by
abandonment. The district court granted appellee’s motion for summary judgment
as prayed;

and from such judgment, the Penn Bowling Recreation Center
appeals.

The arguments that appellee addressed to the district court
on the hearing on the motion for summary judgment embraced the contentions

that appellant, as owner of the dominant tenement, had
forfeited and extinguished the right of way by abandonment, as the result of
subjecting

the servient tenement to an additional and enlarged use or
servitude in connection with other premises to which the easement was not

appurtenant; that it had been guilty of the misuse of the
easement of the right of way by reason of having used it for the parking of
motor

vehicles; and that, by certain masonry constructions,
appellant had, in any event, made it impossible to use the right of way for
egress and

ingress.

With regard to the claim that appellant had subjected the
servient tenement to a burden in excess of that imposed by the original
easement, it

appears that after the creation of the right of way for the
benefit of the dominant tenement, appellant purchased not only that tenement
but other

real property adjacent thereto, the latter property not
being entitled to the enjoyment of the easement. Appellant then constructed a
building

occupying a part of the dominant tenement, as well as the
additional property adjacent thereto. Not all of the dominant tenement is
occupied by

the building. In fact, the total of the area of that portion
of the dominant tenement, together with the non-dominant property over which
the

building is constructed, is a smaller area than the area of
the original dominant tenement. The building, thus constructed, houses a large
bowling

alley and restaurant. Appellant in the past has been using
the right of way to bring fuel oil, food, equipment, and supplies to the
building, and

removing trash, garbage, and other material therefrom.

It is contended by appellant that since the area of the
dominant and non-dominant land served by the easement is less than the original
area

of the dominant tenement, the use made by appellant of the
right of way to serve the building located on the lesser area is not materially

increased or excessive. It is true that where the nature and
extent of the use of an easement is, by its terms, unrestricted, the use by the
dominant

tenement may be increased or enlarged. McCullough et al. v.
Broad

#1022

Exchange Company et al., 92 N.Y.S. 533 (App. Div. N.Y.
1905). But the owner of the dominant tenement may not subject the servient
tenement

to use or servitude in connection with other premises to
which the easement is not appurtenant. See Williams v. James, Eng. Law. Rep.
(1867), 2

C.P. 577. And when an easement is being used in such a
manner, an injunction will be issued to prevent such use. Appellant, therefore,
may not

use the easement to serve both the dominant and non-dominant
property, even though the area thereof is less than the original area of the

dominant tenement.

The disposition of the foregoing issue brings us to the
principal legal question in the case: whether appellant’s use of the right of
way

resulted in the forfeiture and extinguishment of the
easement by abandonment, and thereby entitled appellee, on a motion for summary
judgment,

to a decree permanently enjoining appellant from using the
right of way.

Misuse of an easement right is not sufficient to constitute
a forfeiture, waiver, or abandonment of such right. The right to an easement is
not

lost by using it in an unauthorized manner or to an
unauthorized extent, unless it is impossible to sever the increased burden so
as to preserve to

the owner of the dominant tenement that to which he is
entitled, and impose on the servient tenement only that burden which was
originally

imposed upon it.

From the record before us, we are unable to ascertain what
the total additional burden is that has been cast upon the servient tenement as
the

result of appellant’s use of the right of way for ingress
to, and egress from, the building which was located on part of the dominant and
the non-

dominant property. As has been mentioned, the building
houses a bowling alley and restaurant. From affidavits on file, it appears that
a soda

fountain and luncheonette used in connection with the
restaurant are located in that part of the building situate on the non-dominant
real estate,

which, of course, is not entitled to enjoyment of the
easement; and it further appears that the right of way is used for the purpose
of bringing

supplies for the fountain and luncheonette and removing
trash and garbage therefrom. It is not disclosed whether other supplies or
materials

brought to, or removed from, the building over the right of
way are required for the use of that part of the structure located on the
dominant estate

or on the non-dominant property, or both. Affidavits filed
by appellant indicate, however, that oil for heating purposes is delivered to
the loading

platform over the right of way. Whether the oil furnace is
located on the dominant or non-dominant property does not appear. But it is
declared

on the part of Penn Bowling that if the right of way were
barred to appellant, a great hardship would result in the operation of the
building

housing the bowling alley and other facilities, and would
necessitate large and expensive alterations of its building. Appellant may well
be

obliged to remodel its structure in order to operate, but it
would appear that this can be done and, consequently, appellee is not entitled
to a

decree extinguishing the easement or to a permanent
injunction on

#1023

the pleadings and proofs before us. Furthermore, appellant’s
building fronts on a public thoroughfare and changes conceivably could be made
so

that the non-dominant property could be served from the
street. In any event, appellant can use the right of way only to serve the
dominant

tenement.

An authorized use and an unauthorized use may be
intermingled in such a way as to justify enjoining any use until the
circumstances have

so changed that the authorized use may be permitted without
affording opportunity for the unauthorized use, which it would be difficult to

discover or prove. In such a case, the issuance of an
injunction may be justified restraining any use until the building is so
altered or changed that

that part of it which is on the dominant tenement may enjoy
the easement without permitting its enjoyment by the other part of the building

having no right thereto. So where it can not be ascertained
whether the easement of a right of way is being used solely for the enjoyment
of the

dominant tenement, or for additional property also, an
injunction may be granted against further use of the easement until such time
as it may be

shown that only the dominant tenement is served by the
easement.

Appellee claims that appellant itself has made the use of
the right of way for ingress and egress impossible, by constructing adjacent to
its

building a wall and loading platform which occupies the
space between the building and the right of way, and that, therefore, appellant
can not

get onto its premises from the right of way but can only
come up to them. To this contention, appellant replies that the platform, which
occupies a

space ten feet wide, can easily be demolished and leveled
off even with the right of way, and thus afford ample space for any of its
trucks to park

on appellant’s own land for purposes of loading or
unloading. If the loading dock were removed so as to permit the use of the
right of way for the

dominant estate, appellee’s contention that appellant has
made it impossible to use the easement for ingress or egress could not be
sustained. This

is a question, however, to be determined by the trial court
after the taking of proofs in regard thereto.

Moreover, it is asserted by appellant that, in any event, in
using the right of way for ingress to and egress from the dominant tenement,

appellant is not required to cross over the line separating
its property from the right of way, but that ingress and egress not only mean
passing

over the easement onto appellant’s property and going from
such property back over the easement, but also comprehend the coming to, and
going

away from, the line of the dominant tenement. On this
question, we here express no opinion, as the determination of such issue is, in
the first

instance, for the trial court.

Appellee further complains that appellant misused the
easement by parking motor vehicles on the right of way. The use of the easement
for

purposes of ingress and egress does not include its use for
parking purposes and an injunction may issue to prevent such a use. However, it

#1024

is to be said that appellant is entitled to a reasonable use
and enjoyment of the easement for purposes of ingress and egress. In
determining what

is a reasonable use, the easement is to be construed in the
light of the situation of the property and the surrounding circumstances for
the purpose

of giving effect to the intention of the parties. The long
continued use of the right of way for the purpose of loading or unloading
supplies at

appellant’s premises may indicate an intention of the
parties that the easement might be used for that purpose. But appellant would
thereby

acquire no right to make any use of the easement which would
unreasonably interfere with its use by appellee. Appellee has located on the

premises in question its central offices and commissary,
which is engaged in supplying sixteen restaurants in Washington and vicinity,
and

requires almost constant use of the driveway by appellee.
Appellant’s parking of vehicles on the right of way at a time when appellee
needs its

use would constitute an unlawful interference with the
latter’s right. The determination of these questions largely depends upon the

circumstances of the case and is properly for the district
court.

In accordance with the foregoing, the judgment is set aside
and the case remanded to the district court for further proceedings consonant

with this opinion, with the reservation of right to the
appellee to apply for a temporary injunction pending final decision of the
court.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .What is Hot Shoppes’ real complaint here? Does the
court’s disposition promise to achieve a resolution of the dispute? Why did the
parties

resort to litigation rather than working out the conflict
among themselves like good neighbors?

2 .Suppose Penn Bowling does not use the easement for
nonappurtenant property, but simply experiences a surge in patronage that
requires more

intensive use of the easement. What standard should a court
employ in assessing a claim of “overuse” of an easement? See Hayes v. Aquia
Marina, Inc.,

414 S.E. 2 d 820 (Va. 1992 ) (applying a standard of
reasonableness in assessing such a claim); Bartholomew v. Staheli, 195 P. 2 d
824 (Cal. App. 1948 )

(upholding injunction against increased use of an easement
where an “easement for access to a tranquil home and farm was converted into a
turbulent

route to reach a hilarious nudist colony”). Does it make
sense to apply a rule of strict liability to claims of nonappurtenant use,
while assessing other

claims of overuse under a standard of reasonableness?

3 .The court in this case considers only injunctive relief
(a property rule) rather than damages (a liability rule). Would a liability
rule provide a

better mechanism for mediating conflicts over misuse of an
easement? In a widely noted case that also involved the use of an easement to
serve after-

acquired nonappurtenant property, the court decided to award
damages rather than injunctive relief. Brown v. Voss, 715 P. 2 d 514 (Wash.
1986 ); see also

Lee J. Strang, Damages as the Appropriate Remedy for “Abuse”
of an Easement: Moving Toward Consistency, Efficiency, and Fairness in Property

Law, 15 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 933 ( 2008 ). In _Brown_ , since
no actual harm could

```



1025



```

be shown (the intensity of use did not increase), only $ 1
in nominal damages was awarded. Is such an award likely to achieve a resolution
of the issues

between the parties?

### 2 .COVENANTS

Closely related to easements are covenants or promises
respecting the use of land. Easements are paradigmatically about the right to
go onto

land; they are abrogations of the servient owner’s right to
exclude. Covenants are generally about the right to insist on the use or nonuse
of land;

as such, they typically prescribe a more or less elaborate
system of governance rules. Easements are nearly always affirmative, but
covenants can

be either affirmative or negative.

There is little doubt that a contract between two neighbors,
A and B, respecting the way they use their respective properties can be
enforced

by either one against the other. Thus, if A and B promise
each other to plant only red geraniums in their window boxes, and A decides
instead to

plant white geraniums, B can sue A for breach of contract,
assuming the usual contractual formalities (consideration, etc.) are met. The

difficulties arise when one of the original parties, let’s
say A, has transferred her interest, and the question becomes whether the
promise is

enforceable against A’s successor when A’s successor decides
to plant white geraniums. Over the years, courts have developed two theories
that

will allow promises respecting the use of the land to run
with the land. One theory asks whether the promise is enforceable against
successors as

an “equitable servitude.” The other asks whether the promise
is enforceable against successors as a “real covenant.” In a throwback to the
old

division between common-law courts and courts of equity,
often the critical factor in determining which theory applies is the nature of
the relief

that the plaintiff seeks. If an injunction is sought, then
the matter lies in equity, and courts will generally apply the equitable
servitude theory. If

damages are sought, then the matter falls on the common-law
side of the old division, and courts will generally apply the real covenant
theory. It

is important to appreciate, however, that equitable
servitudes and real covenants are not two different things. They are the same
thing—promises

respecting the use of land—and the label that attaches in
deciding whether these promises run with the land is determined by the theory
for

enforcing the promise against successors, not by any thing
intrinsic in the nature of the promise itself.

Notwithstanding the different theories for determining
whether they run with the land, all covenants share certain features in common.

Covenants are less “property like” than easements and lie
closer to the contract end of the property-contract spectrum. Thus, it appears
that

covenants impose no duties of forbearance on third parties.
Moreover, one cannot acquire a covenant by prescription, implication,
necessity, or

estoppel. The Statute of Frauds applies, and all covenants
must be in writing. Generally speaking, covenants function like “add ons” to
the

#1026

basic package of rights and liabilities that landowners
normally have—specific modifications that originate in written contractual
undertakings

that relate to particular parcels of land.

a.EQUITABLE SERVITUDES

English common law recognized only one circumstance in which
covenants regarding the use of land would run to successors in interest:

when either a lessor or a lessee transferred his interest in
property subject to a lease (see Chapter VI). The common-law courts refused to
enforce

covenants between neighboring landowners as interests
running with the land. This proved to be a major inconvenience in efforts to
control

incompatible land uses by contract. Eventually, the court of
equity came to the rescue.

#### Tulk v. Moxhay

```



Court of Chancery, England, 1848.



2 Phillips 774 , 41 Eng. Rep. 1143.



```

In the year 1808 the Plaintiff, being then the owner in fee
of the vacant piece of ground in Leicester Square, as well as of several of the

houses forming the Square, sold the piece of ground by the
description of “Leicester Square garden or pleasure ground, with the equestrian
statue

then standing in the centre thereof, and the iron railing
and stone work round the same,” to one Elms in fee: and the deed of conveyance

contained a covenant by Elms, for himself, his heirs, and
assigns, with the Plaintiff, his heirs, executors, and administrators, “that
Elms, his heirs,

and assigns should, and would from time to time, and at all
times thereafter at his and their own costs and charges, keep and maintain the
said

piece of ground and square garden, and the iron railing
round the same in its then form, and in sufficient and proper repair as a
square garden and

pleasure ground, in an open state, uncovered with any
buildings, in neat and ornamental order; and that it should be lawful for the
inhabitants of

Leicester Square, tenants of the Plaintiff, on payment of a
reasonable rent for the same, to have keys at their own expense and the
privilege of

admission therewith at any time or times into the said
square garden and pleasure ground.”

The piece of land so conveyed passed by divers mesne
conveyances into the hands of the Defendant, whose purchase deed contained no

similar covenant with his vendor: but he admitted that he
had purchased with notice of the covenant in the deed of 1808.

The Defendant having manifested an intention to alter the
character of the square garden, and asserted a right, if he thought fit, to
build upon

it, the Plaintiff, who still remained owner of several
houses in the square, filed this bill for an injunction; and an injunction was
granted by the

Master of the Rolls to restrain the Defendant from
converting or using the piece of ground and square garden, and the iron railing
round the

#1027

same, to or for any other purpose than as a square garden
and pleasure ground in an open state, and uncovered with buildings. * * *

■ THE
LORD CHANCELLOR [Cottenham] * * * That this Court has jurisdiction to enforce a
contract between the owner of land and his neighbour

purchasing a part of it, that the latter shall either use or
abstain from using the land purchased in a particular way, is, what I never
knew disputed.

Here there is no question about the contract: the owner of
certain houses in the square sells the land adjoining, with a covenant from the

purchaser not to use it for any other purpose than as a
square garden. And it is now contended, not that the vendee could violate that
contract, but

that he might sell the piece of land, and that the purchaser
from him may violate it without this Court having any power to interfere. If
that were

so, it would be impossible for an owner of land to sell part
of it without incurring the risk of rendering what he retains worthless. It is
said that,

the covenant being one which does not run with the land,
this Court cannot enforce it; but the question is, not whether the covenant
runs with the

land, but whether a party shall be permitted to use the land
in a manner inconsistent with the contract entered into by his vendor, and with
notice

of which he purchased. Of course, the price would be
affected by the covenant, and nothing could be more inequitable than that the
original

purchaser should be able to sell the property the next day
for a greater price, in consideration of the assignee being allowed to escape
from the

liability which he had himself undertaken.

That the question does not depend upon whether the covenant
runs with the land is evident from this, that if there was a mere agreement and

no covenant, this Court would enforce it against a party
purchasing with notice of it; for if an equity is attached to the property by
the owner, no

one purchasing with notice of that equity can stand in a
different situation from the party from whom he purchased. * * *

With respect to the observations of Lord Brougham in Keppell
v. Bailey (2 M. & K. 517), [39 Eng. Rep. 1042 (Ch. 1834),] he never could

have meant to lay down that this Court would not enforce an
equity attached to land by the owner, unless under such circumstances as would

maintain an action at law. If that be the result of his
observations, I can only say that I cannot coincide with it.

I think the cases cited before the Vice-Chancellor and this
decision of the Master of the Rolls perfectly right, and, therefore, that this
motion

must be refused, with costs.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

```



1 .Leicester Square has had a long history that implicates
many of the themes of this course:



In the middle of the seventeenth century the Earl of
Leicester laid out Leicester Square and built Leicester House on its north side
* * *



The basin [in the center] was replaced in 1748 by a gilded
equestrian statue, in metal, of George I by Van Nost. [The property descended
to



two married Sidney sisters, one of whose shares was sold to
James S. Tulk in 1772. Later, partition was had.] Meanwhile, the social status
of



Leicester Square had declined, and since the division of
ownership the central garden had fallen on evil days * * * The enclosure became
a



wilderness, a receptacle for rubbish, and a last resting
place for dead cats. King George lost an arm and his horse a leg.



Both Tulk and Moxhay died in 1849. In 1851 (the year of the
first International Exposition, at the Crystal Palace) Wyld, a geographer,



purchased the garden from Moxhay’s widow for the purpose of
erecting thereon a building to contain a large model of the earth. As the Tulk



family objected, Wyld made an agreement with them, which
refers to the very ruinous and dilapidated condition of the garden and the iron



railings, and in which Wyld was licensed to erect a globe
for ten years in return for an option to the Tulks to purchase an undivided
half of the



garden at the end of that time for £ 500. The owners of the
former Sidney houses on the north side of the Square refused to participate in
this



agreement. A vast domed structure known as “Wyld’s Globe”
was then erected and used for geographical and historical lectures and
exhibits.



In



```

1029



```

```



1861 John A. Tulk, the grandson of Charles, exercised the
option, so that he and Wyld became co-tenants of the garden. The Globe was
taken



down and the battered statue again set up, to be treated to
the jokes of Punch and the pranks of idlers, who on October 17 , 1866 , painted
the



horse white with black spots and put a foolscap on the head
of King George.



By this time the public authorities had become active. In
1863 a bill was introduced in Parliament for a public market in the Square,



which was successfully opposed. In 1865 the Metropolitan
Board of Works took possession of the garden under the Town Gardens Protection



Act of 1863 ( 26 Vict. c. 13 ), which empowered the Board to
take charge of any grounds which had been set apart for the use of the
inhabitants



of a surrounding square, when the body appointed for the
care of the same had neglected to keep it in proper order. John A. Tulk at once



brought an action of trespass quare clausum fregit against
the Board and won a decision that Leicester Square was not within the statute *
* *



Thus Tulk succeeded in keeping the Square in its desolate
condition. Tulk hoped to convert the garden into building land, as Moxhay had



formerly tried to do. The maintenance of billboards around
the enclosure was prevented by another equity decree (unreported), probably at



the suit of the north side owners. While an appeal was
pending, the Metropolitan Board of Works obtained compulsory powers of
acquisition



by the Leicester Square Act, 1874 ( 27 & 38 Vict. c. 10
).



```

```



Before condemnation took place, Albert Grant, M.P.,
purchased Tulk’s rights, opened negotiations with the other owners, took



possession of the garden, and offered it free of cost to the
Board of Works for public enjoyment. The unfortunate horse was removed in



February, 1874 and replaced by a statue of Shakespeare,
while the four corners of the garden were ornamented with statues of former



residents of Leicester Square—Reynolds, Newton, Hogarth, and
Dr. John Hunter. After Mr. Grant had laid out the park in its present form at a



total expenditure of £ 28 , 000 , it was handed over to the
public on July 2 , 1874.

Equity, Jurisdiction and Specific Performance 704 – 06 , 710 – 11 ( 1934 ).

2 .Is the Chancellor’s reasoning here circular? That one is
bound to perform an obligation of which he has notice cannot be doubted, but
just

because one has notice does not mean that he has an
obligation. Is the charge of circularity overcome by the observation that “the
price would be

affected by the covenant, and nothing could be more
inequitable than that the original purchaser should be able to sell the
property the next day for a

greater price”? If the covenant is understood not to be
binding on a subsequent purchaser, wouldn’t this be reflected in the price?

3 .Is _Tulk v. Moxhay_ consistent with the _numerus
clausus_? In order to meet the understandable demand for enforcement of
covenants, the court in

_Tulk_ was well aware that it had to limit the holding in
_Keppell v. Bailey_ , 39

```



1030



```

Eng. Rep. 1042 (Ch. 1834 ), the leading English case holding
that courts lack authority to transform contract rights into new forms of
property rights. In

_Keppell_ , the purchasers of an iron works covenanted on
behalf of themselves and their successors and assigns to purchase all limestone
required by the

works from a particular quarry and to ship the limestone to
the works on a particular railroad. In the court’s view such an arrangement was
enforceable

as a contract between the original parties and would not
work as an unreasonable restraint on alienation, but the Court of Chancery held
that this type of

agreement did not fall within the recognized types of
servitudes enforceable against subsequent purchasers as a property right
running with the land:

```



There can be no harm to allowing the fullest latitude to men
in binding themselves and their representatives, that is, their assets real and



personal, to answer in damages for breach of their
obligations. This tends to no mischief, and is a reasonable liberty to bestow;
but great



detriment would arise and much confusion of rights if
parties were allowed to invent new modes of holding and enjoying real property,
and to



impress upon their lands and tenements a peculiar character,
which should follow them into all hands, however remote. Every close, every



messuage, might thus be held in several fashion; and it
would hardly be possible to know what rights the acquisition of any parcel
conferred,



or what obligations it imposed.



```

39 Eng. Rep. at 1049. Lord Chancellor Brougham seemed to
object to “fancies,” as they have been called, on the grounds that they create
excessive

third-party information costs. For development of this idea,
see Thomas W. Merrill & Henry E. Smith, Optimal Standardization in the Law
of Property:

The _Numerus Clausus_ Principle, 110 Yale L.J. 1 ( 2000 ).
Is _Tulk_ inconsistent with this view? Who needs to look out for the content of
covenants? Or

does notice, such as that provided by modern land records,
mean that any restriction should be able to run with the land? See, e.g.,
Richard A. Epstein,

Notice and Freedom of Contract in the Law of Servitudes, 55
S. Cal. L. Rev. 1353 ( 1982 ); see also Alfred F. Conard, Easement Novelties,
30 Cal. L.

Rev. 125 , 131 – 33 ( 1942 ). Is this an example of
“equitable property,” the prominent example being the trust (Chapter VI)? If so
what exactly is equitable

property? See Ben McFarlane, _Tulk v. Moxhay_ ( 1848 ), in
Landmark Cases in Equity (Charles Mitchell & Paul Mitchell eds., 2012 ).

4 .Given its origins in equity, it follows that general
considerations of equity apply in determining whether to issue an injunction
enforcing an

equitable servitude. For example, in _Wrotham Park Estate
Co. Ltd. v. Parkside Homes Ltd_ ., [ 1974 ] 1 W.L.R. 798 (Eng.), the court
declined to grant a

permanent injunction against a developer who had constructed
homes on land in violation of a servitude (of which the developer had notice)
requiring

advance permission of the layout plan by the dominant owner.
The court found that the homes had already been built and were occupied, and
that the

dominant owner had not sought a preliminary injunction
before construction started, and thus a permanent injunction requiring
demolition of the homes

would cause undue hardship. The developer was, however,
required to pay

```



1031



```

damages, based on a percentage of the profits earned from
the development. Compare _Boomer v. Atlantic Cement_ , supra, in the context of
nuisance.

b.REAL COVENANTS

American courts did not consider themselves bound by the
English view that covenants run to successors in interest only in the
lessor-lessee

context. Instead, they developed the concept of the real
covenant—a covenant attached to fee simple property that, under certain
circumstances

analogous to the lessor-lessee doctrine of running
covenants, will bind successors in an action at law. The following case applies
this American

invention to a subdivision that featured an early version of
the common-interest communities so prevalent today (see Chapter VI).

Court of Appeals of New York, 1938.



15 N.E. 2 d 793.



```

■
LEHMAN, JUDGE. The plaintiff, as assignee of Neponsit Realty Company, has
brought this action to foreclose a lien upon land which the

defendant owns. The lien, it is alleged, arises from a
covenant, condition or charge contained in a deed of conveyance of the land
from Neponsit

Realty Company to a predecessor in title of the defendant.
The defendant purchased the land at a judicial sale. The referee’s deed to the

defendant and every deed in the defendant’s chain of title
since the conveyance of the land by Neponsit Realty Company purports to convey
the

property subject to the covenant, condition or charge
contained in the original deed. * * *

It appears that in January, 191 1, Neponsit Realty Company,
as owner of a tract of land in Queens county, caused to be filed in the office
of

the clerk of the county a map of the land. The tract was
developed for a strictly residential community, and Neponsit Realty Company
conveyed

lots in the tract to purchasers, describing such lots by
reference to the filed map and to roads and streets shown thereon. In 1917,
Neponsit Realty

Company conveyed the land now owned by the defendant to
Robert Oldner Deyer and his wife by deed which contained the covenant upon

which the plaintiff’s cause of action is based.

That covenant provides:

And the party of the second part for the party of the second
part and the heirs, successors and assigns of the party of the second

part further covenants that the property conveyed by this
deed shall be subject to an annual charge in such an amount as will be fixed

by the party of the first part, its successors and assigns,
not, however exceeding in any year the sum of four ($4.00) Dollars per lot

20x100 feet. The assigns of the party of

#1032

the first part may include a Property Owners’ Association
which may hereafter be organized for the purposes referred to in this

paragraph, and in case such association is organized the
sums in this paragraph provided for shall be payable to such association. The

party of the second part for the party of the second part
and the heirs, successors and assigns of the party of the second part covenants

that they will pay this charge to the party of the first
part, its successors and assigns on the first day of May in each and every
year, and

further covenants that said charge shall on said date in
each year become a lien on the land and shall continue to be such lien until
fully

paid. Such charge shall be payable to the party of the first
part or its successors or assigns, and shall be devoted to the maintenance of

the roads, paths, parks, beach, sewers and such other public
purposes as shall from time to time be determined by the party of the first

part, its successors or assigns. And the party of the second
part by the acceptance of this deed hereby expressly vests in the party of the

first part, its successors and assigns, the right and power
to bring all actions against the owner of the premises hereby conveyed or any

part thereof for the collection of such charge and to
enforce the aforesaid lien therefor.

These covenants shall run with the land and shall be
construed as real covenants running with the land until January 31st, 1940,

when they shall cease and determine.

Every subsequent deed of conveyance of the property in the
defendant’s chain of title, including the deed from the referee to the
defendant,

contained, as we have said, a provision that they were made
subject to covenants and restrictions of former deeds of record.

There can be no doubt that Neponsit Realty Company intended
that the covenant should run with the land and should be enforceable by a

property owners association against every owner of property
in the residential tract which the realty company was then developing. The
language

of the covenant admits of no other construction. Regardless
of the intention of the parties, a covenant will run with the land and will be

enforceable against a subsequent purchaser of the land at
the suit of one who claims the benefit of the covenant, only if the covenant
complies

with certain legal requirements. These requirements rest
upon ancient rules and precedents. The age-old essentials of a real covenant,
aside from

the form of the covenant, may be summarily formulated as
follows: (1) It must appear that grantor and grantee intended that the covenant
should

run with the land; (2) it must appear that the covenant is
one “touching” or “concerning” the land with which it runs; (3) it must appear
that there

is “privity of estate” between the promisee or party
claiming the benefit of the covenant and the right to enforce it, and the
promisor or party who

rests under the burden of the covenant. Clark on Covenants
and Interests Running with Land, p. 74. Although the deeds of Neponsit Realty

#1033

Company conveying lots in the tract it developed “contained
a provision to the effect that the covenants ran with the land, such provision
in the

absence of the other legal requirements is insufficient to
accomplish such a purpose.” Morgan Lake Co. v. New York, N. H. & H. R. R.
Co., 186

N.E. 6 85, 686 (N.Y. 1933). In his opinion in that case,
Judge Crane posed but found it unnecessary to decide many of the questions
which the

court must consider in this case.

Figure 9-8

Street Scene in Neponsit Subdivision, June 2006

The covenant in this case is intended to create a charge or
obligation to pay a fixed sum of money to be “devoted to the maintenance of the

roads, paths, parks, beach, sewers and such other public
purposes as shall from time to time be determined by the party of the first
part [the

grantor], its successors or assigns.” It is an affirmative
covenant to pay money for use in connection with, but not upon, the land which
it is said

is subject to the burden of the covenant. Does such a
covenant “touch” or “concern” the land? These terms are not part of a statutory
definition, a

limitation placed by the State upon the power of the courts
to enforce covenants intended to run with the land by the parties who entered
into the

covenants. Rather they are words used by courts in England
in old cases to describe a limitation which the courts themselves created or to

formulate a test which the courts have devised and which the
courts voluntarily apply. Cf. Spencer’s Case, 5 Co. Rep. 16a, 77 Eng. Rep. 72
(K.B.

1583) Coke, vol. 3, part 5, 16a; Mayor of Congleton v.
      Pattison, 10 East 13 0, 103 Eng. Rep. 725 (Ch. 1808). In truth such a
      description or test so

formulated is too vague to be of much assistance and judges
and academic scholars alike have struggled, not with entire success, to
formulate a

test at once more satisfactory and more accurate. “It has
been found impossible to state any absolute tests to determine what covenants
touch and

concern land and what do not. The question is one for the
court

#1034

to determine in the exercise of its best judgment upon the
facts of each case.” Clark, op. cit. p. 76.

Even though that be true, a determination by a court in one
case upon particular facts will often serve to point the way to correct
decision in

other cases upon analogous facts. Such guideposts may not be
disregarded. It has been often said that a covenant to pay a sum of money is a

personal affirmative covenant which usually does not concern
or touch the land. Such statements are based upon English decisions which hold
in

effect that only covenants, which compel the covenanter to
submit to some restriction on the use of his property, touch or concern the
land, and

that the burden of a covenant which requires the covenanter
to do an affirmative act, even on his own land, for the benefit of the owner of
a

“dominant” estate, does not run with his land. Miller v.
Clary, 103 N.E. 1114 (N.Y. 1913). In that case the court pointed out that in
many

jurisdictions of this country the narrow English rule has
been criticized and a more liberal and flexible rule has been substituted. In
this State the

courts have not gone so far. We have not abandoned the
historic distinction drawn by the English courts. So this court has recently
said: “Subject

to a few exceptions not important at this time, there is now
in this state a settled rule of law that a covenant to do an affirmative act,
as

distinguished from a covenant merely negative in effect,
does not run with the land so as to charge the burden of performance on a
subsequent

grantee [citing cases]. This is so though the burden of such
a covenant is laid upon the very parcel which is the subject-matter of the

conveyance.” Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, v. New York
& Queens County Ry. Co., 170 N.E. 887, 892 (N.Y. 1930), opinion by Cardozo,
Ch.

J.

Both in that case and in the case of Miller v. Clary, supra,
the court pointed out that there were some exceptions or limitations in the

application of the general rule. Some promises to pay money
have been enforced, as covenants running with the land, against subsequent
holders

of the land who took with notice of the covenant. Cf.
Greenfarb v. R. S. K. Realty Corp., 175 N.E. 649 (N.Y. 1931); Morgan Lake Co.
v. New

York, N. H. & H. R. R. Co., supra. It may be difficult
to classify these exceptions or to formulate a test of whether a particular
covenant to pay

money or to perform some other act falls within the general
rule that ordinarily an affirmative covenant is a personal and not a real
covenant, or

falls outside the limitations placed upon the general rule.
At least it must “touch” or “concern” the land in a substantial degree, and
though it may

be inexpedient and perhaps impossible to formulate a rigid
test or definition which will be entirely satisfactory or which can be applied

mechanically in all cases, we should at least be able to
state the problem and find a reasonable method of approach to it. It has been
suggested

that a covenant which runs with the land must affect the
legal relations—the advantages and the burdens—of the parties to the covenant,
as

owners of particular parcels of land and not merely as
members of the community in general, such as taxpayers or owners of

#1035

other land. Clark, op. cit. p. 76. Cf. Professor Bigelow’s
article on The Contents of Covenants in Leases, 12 Mich.L.Rev. 639 (1914); 30
Law

Quarterly Review, 319 (1914). That method of approach has
the merit of realism. The test is based on the effect of the covenant rather
than on

technical distinctions. Does the covenant impose, on the one
hand, a burden upon an interest in land, which on the other hand increases the
value

of a different interest in the same or related land?

Even though we accept that approach and test, it still
remains true that whether a particular covenant is sufficiently connected with
the use

of land to run with the land, must be in many cases a
question of degree. A promise to pay for something to be done in connection
with the

promisor’s land does not differ essentially from a promise
by the promisor to do the thing himself, and both promises constitute, in a
substantial

sense, a restriction upon the owner’s right to use the land,
and a burden upon the legal interest of the owner. On the other hand, a
covenant to

perform or pay for the performance of an affirmative act
disconnected with the use of the land cannot ordinarily touch or concern the
land in any

substantial degree. Thus, unless we exalt technical form
over substance, the distinction between covenants which run with land and
covenants

which are personal, must depend upon the effect of the
covenant on the legal rights which otherwise would flow from ownership of land
and

which are connected with the land. The problem then is: Does
the covenant in purpose and effect substantially alter these rights?

The opinion in Morgan Lake Co. v. New York, N. H. & H.
R. R. Co., supra, foreshadowed a classification based upon substance rather
than

upon form. It was not the first case, however, in which this
court has based its decision on the substantial effect of a covenant upon legal
relations

of the parties as owners of land. Perhaps the most
illuminating illustration of such an approach to the problem may be drawn from
the “party

wall” cases in this State which are reviewed in the opinion
of the court in Sebald v. Mulholland, 50 N.E. 260 (N.Y. 1898). The court there
pointed

out that in cases, cited in the opinion, where by covenant
between owners of adjoining parcels of land, “a designated party was authorized
to

build a party wall, the other agreeing to pay a portion of
its value when it should be used by him,” the court was constrained to hold
that “the

agreement was a present one. The party who was to build and
the one who was to pay were expressly designated, and the covenant to pay was

clearly a personal one” (50 N.E. page 263). At the same
time, the court also pointed out that such covenants must be distinguished from
the

covenants (passed upon by the court in the earlier case of
Mott v. Oppenheimer, 31 N.E. 1097 (N.Y. 1892)), “by which the parties
conferred, each

upon the other, the authority to erect such [party] wall,
and dedicated to that use a portion of each of their lots, with an agreement
that, if either

should build, the other might have the right to use it by
paying his share of the expense” ( 50 N.E. page 262). In such a case, it was
said by the

court: “It was not and could not then be known who would

#1036

build, or who was to pay when the wall was used. The
agreement was wholly prospective, and its purpose was to impose upon the land
of each,

and not upon either personally, the burden of a future party
wall, and to secure to the land, and thus to its subsequent owners, a
corresponding

right to the use of the wall by paying one-half of its
value. * * * In that case the character of the agreement, its obvious purpose,
its prospective

provisions, and the situation of the lands when the
agreement was made, all concurred in showing an intent that its covenants
should run with the

land, and clearly justified the court in so holding” (50
N.E. page 262).

Looking at the problem presented in this case from the same
point of view and stressing the intent and substantial effect of the covenant

rather than its form, it seems clear that the covenant may
properly be said to touch and concern the land of the defendant and its burden
should

run with the land. True, it calls for payment of a sum of
money to be expended for “public purposes” upon land other than the land
conveyed by

Neponsit Realty Company to plaintiff’s predecessor in title.
By that conveyance the grantee, however, obtained not only title to particular
lots,

but an easement or right of common enjoyment with other
property owners in roads, beaches, public parks or spaces and improvements in
the

same tract. For full enjoyment in common by the defendant
and other property owners of these easements or rights, the roads and public
places

must be maintained. In order that the burden of maintaining
public improvements should rest upon the land benefited by the improvements,
the

grantor exacted from the grantee of the land with its
appurtenant easement or right of enjoyment a covenant that the burden of paying
the cost

should be inseparably attached to the land which enjoys the
benefit. It is plain that any distinction or definition which would exclude
such a

covenant from the classification of covenants which “touch”
or “concern” the land would be based on form and not on substance.

Another difficulty remains. Though between the grantor and
the grantee there was privity of estate, the covenant provides that its benefit

shall run to the assigns of the grantor who “may include a
Property Owners’ Association which may hereafter be organized for the purposes

referred to in this paragraph.” The plaintiff has been
organized to receive the sums payable by the property owners and to expend them
for the

benefit of such owners. Various definitions have been
formulated of “privity of estate” in connection with covenants that run with
the land, but

none of such definitions seems to cover the relationship
between the plaintiff and the defendant in this case. The plaintiff has not
succeeded to

the ownership of any property of the grantor. It does not
appear that it ever had title to the streets or public places upon which
charges which are

payable to it must be expended. It does not appear that it
owns any other property in the residential tract to which any easement or right
of

enjoyment in such property is appurtenant. It is created
solely to act as the assignee of the benefit of the covenant, and it has no
interest of its

own in the enforcement of the covenant.

#1037

The arguments that under such circumstances the plaintiff
has no right of action to enforce a covenant running with the land are all
based

upon a distinction between the corporate property owners
association and the property owners for whose benefit the association has been
formed.

If that distinction may be ignored, then the basis of the
arguments is destroyed. How far privity of estate in technical form is
necessary to enforce

in equity a restrictive covenant upon the use of land,
presents an interesting question. Enforcement of such covenants rests upon
equitable

principles (Tulk v. Moxhay, 2 Phillips, 774, 41 Eng. Rep.
1143 (Ch. 1848); Trustees of Columbia College v. Lynch, 70 N.Y. 440 (1877);
Korn v.

Campbell, 85 N.E. 687 (N.Y. 1908)), and at times, at least,
the violation “of the restrictive covenant may be restrained at the suit of one
who

owns property or for whose benefit the restriction was
established, irrespective of whether there were privity either of estate or of
contract

between the parties, or whether an action at law were
maintainable.” Chesebro v. Moers, 134 N.E. 842, 843 (N.Y. 1922). The covenant
in this

case does not fall exactly within any classification of
“restrictive” covenants, which have been enforced in this State, and no right
to enforce even

a restrictive covenant has been sustained in this State
where the plaintiff did not own property which would benefit by such
enforcement so that

some of the elements of an equitable servitude are present.
In some jurisdictions it has been held that no action may be maintained without
such

elements. But cf. VanSant v. Rose, 103 N.E. 194 (Ill. 1913).
We do not attempt to decide now how far the rule of Trustees of Columbia
College v.

Lynch, supra, will be carried, or to formulate a definite
rule as to when, or even whether, covenants in a deed will be enforced, upon
equitable

principles, against subsequent purchasers with notice, at
the suit of a party without privity of contract or estate. Cf. Equitable Rights
and

Liabilities of Strangers to a Contract, by Harlan F. Stone,
18 Columbia Law Review, 291 (1918). There is no need to resort to such a rule
if the

courts may look behind the corporate form of the plaintiff.

The corporate plaintiff has been formed as a convenient
instrument by which the property owners may advance their common interests. We

do not ignore the corporate form when we recognize that the
Neponsit Property Owners’ Association, Inc., is acting as the agent or
representative

of the Neponsit property owners. As we have said in another
case: when Neponsit Property Owners’ Association, Inc., “was formed, the
property

owners were expected to, and have looked to that
organization as the medium through which enjoyment of their common right might
be

preserved equally for all.” Matter of City of New York,
Public Beach, Borough of Queens, 199 N.E. 5, 9 (N.Y. 1935). Under the
conditions thus

presented we said: “It may be difficult, or even impossible
to classify into recognized categories the nature of the interest of the
membership

corporation and its members in the land. The corporate
entity cannot be disregarded, nor can the separate interests of the members of
the

corporation” (199 N.E. page 8). Only blind adherence to

#1038

an ancient formula devised to meet entirely different
conditions could constrain the court to hold that a corporation formed as a
medium for the

enjoyment of common rights of property owners owns no
property which would benefit by enforcement of common rights and has no cause
of

action in equity to enforce the covenant upon which such
common rights depend. Every reason which in other circumstances may justify the

ancient formula may be urged in support of the conclusion
that the formula should not be applied in this case. In substance if not in
form the

covenant is a restrictive covenant which touches and
concerns the defendant’s land, and in substance, if not in form, there is
privity of estate

between the plaintiff and the defendant. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The action here is to foreclose a lien on the property in
order to secure payment of a debt. Foreclosure was originally regarded as a
proceeding

in equity. Why then does the court apply the real covenant
doctrine as opposed to the equitable servitude theory of _Tulk v. Moxhay_?

2 .Covenants in leases run to successors of the original
lessor or lessee if ( 1 ) the lessor and lessee intend that they will run; and
( 2 ) the covenant is

one that “touches and concerns” the land. The court here
adds a third requirement: that there be “privity of estate” between the party
claiming the benefit

of the covenant and the party subject to the burden of the
covenant. This is obviously designed to mimic the privity of estate that exists
in lease law

between the lessor and a lessee in possession (see Chapter
VI). But what function does the privity-of-estate requirement perform here?
Would it be

better to require that the party to be burdened must have
notice of the covenant, as under the theory of equitable servitudes? Does
privity of estate serve

as a stand-in for a requirement that the benefit of the
promise be appurtenant to a particular parcel of land? Does it make sense to
restrict running

covenants to those that benefit particular land? The English
law of equitable servitudes, as it has developed since _Tulk_ , limits running
covenants to those

appurtenant to particular interests in land. See Robert
Megarry & William Wade, The Law of Real Property § 32 – 044 , at 1352
(Charles Harpum et al.

eds., 7 th ed. 2008 ).

3 .The court paraphrases with approval Professor Bigelow’s
definition of “touch and concern” as a promise that affects “the advantages and
the

burdens” of the owners of the parcels of land either
benefited or burdened by the promise. How helpful is this in singling out those
promises respecting

land which should run? If the owner of Blackacre promises to
cut the hair of the owner of Whiteacre, and the owner of Whiteacre promises in
return to

pay $ 10 a month to the owner of Blackacre, would not this
affect “the advantages and the burdens” of owning either Blackacre or
Whiteacre? Can you

formulate a better test for giving content to what it means
for a promise to touch and concern the land?

4 .Now that the jurisdictions of law and equity have merged,
the distinction between equitable servitudes and real covenants grounded in the
nature

of the relief being sought no longer makes any sense. And
indeed,

```

there is authority suggesting that one can get damages under
an equitable servitude theory and an injunction under a real covenant theory.
See Joseph

William Singer, Property § 6. 5 ( 5 th ed. 2017 ). Most
parties want specific performance—an injunction—anyway ( _Neponsit_ is
something of an

exceptional case in this regard). Having these two bodies of
doctrine does give plaintiffs some flexibility in choosing which path to pursue
in seeking

enforcement. Let us then restate the elements that must be
satisfied under the two approaches to running covenants.

c.THE REQUIREMENTS FOR COVENANTS TO RUN

The major issue with covenants is whether the benefits and
burdens of the deal between the original parties will extend to successors of

those parties—whether the benefits and burdens “run with the
land.” The traditional approaches at law and equity are set out in the American

Law Institute’s Restatement (First) of Property (1944). As
you walk through each approach below, the following diagram may be helpful. In
it,

the original parties (A and B) stand in a relationship
called “horizontal” privity (denoted by horizontal arrows), and successors (C1,
C2, etc., and

D1, D2, etc.) stand in a relationship of “vertical” privity
to the original parties, respectively.

Real Covenant Theory

At law (traditionally in a damages action), for the burden
of a promise to run to the successors in interest to the promisor, one would
have to

establish:

(i) Intent for the burden to run. This can be by language or
inferable “from the circumstances under which the promise was made.”

Restatement (First) of Property § 531 cmt. c. So if B
covenants with A, who is allergic to peanuts, that B will not eat peanuts in
the backyard, the

benefit probably won’t run to A’s successor unless the
circumstances indicate otherwise (for example, A is running an allergy clinic
and sells to

another allergy clinic).

(ii) Horizontal privity. Traditionally a lessor-lessee
relationship was required. Later this was expanded to include other
relationships bonded

by a strong “community of interest” between the parties. See
id. § 534 cmts. a, f. This included relationships defined by a transfer of at
least

some interest in the benefitted or burdened land. Id. §
534(a). Many have questioned whether this requirement has real content. This
requirement

(or lack of it) is illustrated in the following scenario:
Two neighbors sign an agreement wherein they both agree to restrict their use
of their

parcels to residential use and they record. Because they are
not in a grantor-grantee relationship (NB: they could have done this with a
straw),

there is no horizontal privity and so traditionally the
burden does not run. Under the Restatement (Third) of Property (about which
more later),

which doesn’t require horizontal privity, the burden would
run.

#1040

Figure 9-9

Running Covenants

(iii) Vertical privity. For the burden to run at law, the
successor in interest to the promisor who covenanted for the burden must hold
the

entire durational interest held by the promisor at the time
she made the covenant. See id. at § 535. In a lessor-lessee situation, vertical
privity

would be present in assignments (where these are determined
by whether the whole interest is transferred, see Chapter VI), but not in a
sublease.

(iv) Touch and concern. The covenant must touch and concern
the land, as discussed in the cases. As we will see this requirement is

abandoned in the Restatement (Third) of Property, but no
court has yet clearly followed this proposed approach.

At law, for the benefit of a promise to run, there are fewer
requirements, presumably because a selling landowner would have an incentive

to advertise benefits, as opposed to burdens:

(i) Intent for the benefit to run.

(ii) Vertical privity. For the benefit to run, the successor
in interest to the promisee or beneficiary need only succeed to some estate or

interest , not necessarily an estate or interest of the same
duration as was held by the promisee or beneficiary (so this is a less
stringent

requirement than in the case of the vertical privity
required for burden to run). See id. § 547.

(iii) Touch and concern.

Equitable Servitude Theory

In equity, courts starting with Tulk v. Moxhay , supra, have
been more accommodating in granting enforcement. Traditionally equity

#1041

would give specific performance, which is the remedy that
parties usually want in these cases. Equity was more hospitable to affirmative

covenants than was the common law. And by allowing equitable
enforcement of negative covenants, parties were able to expand somewhat upon

the limited menu of negative easements (light, air,
subjacent/lateral support, flow of artificial stream).

For the burden of a promise to run in equity, there must be:

(i) Intent.

(ii) Notice. This is characteristic of equity. If the
covenant is in the deed given to the successor in interest to the promisor,
there is no

problem enforcing it against the successor. If it is not in
the deed, then actual or inquiry notice must be present. Inquiry notice is
furnished by

facts that would make a reasonable person inquire further
and find the covenant. If the successor has neither actual nor inquiry notice,
then she is

considered a bona fide purchaser (like a good faith
purchaser considered in Chapter VIII) and the burden cannot be enforced against
her. See

Restatement (First) of Property § 539. With the advent of
recording acts, constructive notice through filing in the land records is
another avenue

for satisfying the notice requirement.

(iii) Touch and concern (sometimes expressed in equity as
“affecting the use of the land”).

For the benefit of a promise to run in equity, there must
be:

(i) Intent.

(ii) Touch and concern (again, with variant language).

Can you see why notice would not be required for the benefit
to run in equity?

The Third Restatement

The American Law Institute’s Restatement (Third) of
Property: Servitudes (2000) (hereinafter “Restatement”) relaxes some of these

requirements. By and large, it takes a more contractarian
approach to servitudes. The Restatement advocates abolishing the traditional
property-

law requirements for the running of servitudes, such as the
touch and concern doctrine and the privity requirements. In place of the
traditional

requirements for enforcing servitudes against successors
that made the running of a servitude exceptional, the Restatement makes
enforceability

the default. Broadly speaking, this would give servitudes a
strongly contractarian flavor. Like the law of contracts, the Restatement
features

writing requirements and exceptions for violations of public
policy, unconscionability, and the like. These exceptions are perhaps stronger
than in

current contract law but differ from them mostly in degree.

The Restatement provides for a baseline for the creation of
servitudes that is grounded in contract and party intent: “A servitude is
created

(1)

#1042

if the owner of the property to be burdened (a) enters into
a contract or makes a conveyance intended to create a servitude that complies
with

§ 2.7 (Statute of Frauds) or § 2.9 (exception to the Statute
of Frauds).. .” Restatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes § 2.1 (2000). The

associated commentary makes clear the motivation for this
approach:

This Chapter’s [Chapter 2, Creation of Servitudes] treatment
of servitude creation reflects the basic position that servitudes are useful

devices that people ought to be able to use without
artificial constraints. The primary function of the law is to ascertain and
give effect

to the intent of the parties, not to force them into
arbitrary transactional forms. If they meet minimal formal requirements, their

expressed intent is effective to create a servitude, unless
the transaction violates a constitutional, statutory, or public-policy norm.

Id. Introductory Note at 49.

The Restatement itself is, if anything, clearer in making
validity conform to a contract-like rather than a property-like vision of
servitudes:

A servitude created as provided in Chapter 2 is valid unless
it is illegal or unconstitutional or violates public policy.

Servitudes that are invalid because they violate public
policy include, but are not limited to:

(1)a servitude that is arbitrary, spiteful, or capricious;

(2)a servitude that unreasonably burdens a fundamental
constitutional right;

(3)a servitude that imposes an unreasonable restraint on
alienation under § 3.4 or § 3.5;

(4)a servitude that imposes an unreasonable restraint on
trade or competition under § 3.6; and

(5)a servitude that is unconscionable under § 3.7.

Restatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes § 3.1 (2000).
Comment a, entitled “Historical note and rationale” states:

This section applies the modern principle of freedom of
contract to creation of servitudes. The Restatement of Contracts explains the

principle: “In general, parties may contract as they wish,
and courts will enforce their agreements without passing on their

substance.... The principle of freedom of contract is rooted
in the notion that it is in the public interest to recognize that individuals

have broad powers to order their own affairs.”

Id. § 3.1 cmt. a. (footnote omitted, citing to Restatement
Second, Contracts, Introductory Note to Chapter 8.). As noted earlier, this
means that, as

under contract law, servitudes are presumed valid. Id. (“The

#1043

effect of the rule is to shift to the party claiming
invalidity of a servitude the burden to establish that it is illegal or
unconstitutional, or violates

public policy.”). Id.

As of this writing no court has clearly adopted this
approach, to the annoyance of the Reporter. See Susan F. French, Symposium on

Servitudes, Part II, Can Covenants Not to Sue, Covenants
Against Competition and Spite Covenants Run with Land? Comparing Results Under

the Touch or Concern Doctrine and the Restatement Third,
Property (Servitudes), 38 Real Prop. Prob. & Tr. J. 267 (2003). Some courts
have

loosened the touch and concern requirement, for example by
making it one factor in a reasonableness inquiry, see Davidson Bros., Inc. v.
D. Katz

& Sons, Inc., 579 A.2d 288 (N.J. 1990); and one court
approvingly (and confusingly) cited a tentative draft of the Restatement in a
case

involving an easement in gross (easements were never
required to touch and concern in order to be enforceable against successor
servient

landowners), Bennett v. Commissioner of Food and
Agriculture, 576 N.E.2d 1365, 1367–68 (Mass. 1 991). Mostly courts have ignored
the

Restatement. Note, Touch and Concern, the Restatement
(Third) of Property: Servitudes, and a Proposal, 122 Harv. L. Rev. 938, 944–45
(2009).

Some commentators have argued that the older doctrines serve
a useful purpose in allowing courts to police servitudes more closely. See,
e.g., A.

Dan Tarlock, Touch and Concern is Dead, Long Live the
Doctrine, 77 Neb. L. Rev. 804 (1998); Jeffrey E. Stake, Toward an Economic

Understanding of Touch and Concern, 1988 Duke L.J. 925. For
discussion of the policies of allowing servitudes to run, and the differences

between servitudes in real, personal, and intellectual
property, see Carol M. Rose, Servitudes, in Research Handbook on the Economics
of

Property Law 296 (Kenneth Ayotte & Henry E. Smith, eds.
2011); Molly Shaffer Van Houweling, The New Servitudes, 96 Geo. L.J. 885
(2008).

Court of Appeals of New York, 1976.



349 N.E. 2 d 816.



```

■
GABRIELLI, JUSTICE. In 1951, Orchard Hill Realties, Inc., a subdivider and
developer, conveyed certain property in the subdivision of Orchard

Hill in Orange County to William and Pauline Baum. The deed
to the Baums contained the following provision:

The party of the first part shall supply to the party of the
second part, seasonably from May 1st to October 1st, of each year, water

for domestic use only, from the well located on other
property of the party of the first part, and the party of the second part
agrees to

take said water and to pay the party of the first part, a
fee of Thirty-five ($35.00) dollars per year, for said water so supplied.

#1044

In addition, the deed also contained the following:

It is expressly provided that the covenants herein contained
shall run with the land * * * and shall bind and shall enure to the

benefit of the heirs, distributees, successors, legal
representatives and assigns of the respective parties hereto.

Appellant is the successor in interest of Orchard Hill
Realties, Inc., and respondent, after a series of intervening conveyances, is
the

successor in interest of the Baums. The deed conveying title
to respondent does not contain the aforementioned covenant to purchase water
and,

in fact, none of the deeds following the original deed to
the Baums contained the mutual promises regarding water supply. While some of
the

deeds in the chain of title from Baum contained a provision
that they were made subject to the restrictions in the deed from Orchard Hill
Realties

to Baum, the deed to respondents contained no such
covenants, restrictions or “subject to” clause.

According to the stipulated facts, respondent has refused to
accept and pay for water offered by appellant since he has constructed his own

well to service what is now a year-round dwelling.
Appellant, therefore, instituted this action to collect the fee specified in
the covenant

(contained only in the original deed to Baum) for the supply
of water which, appellant contends, respondent is bound to accept. The action
was

styled as one “for goods sold and delivered” even though
respondent did not utilize any of appellant’s water. Two of the lower courts
found that

the covenant “ran” with the land and, hence, was binding
upon respondent as successor to the Baums, but the Appellate Division reversed
and

held that the covenant could not be enforced against
respondent. We must now decide whether the promise of the original grantees to
accept and

make payment for a seasonal water supply from the well of
their grantor is enforceable against subsequent grantees and may be said to
“run with

the land”. We agree with the determination of the Appellate
Division and affirm its order.

Regardless of the express recital in a deed that a covenant
will run with the land, a promise to do an affirmative act contained in a deed
is

generally not binding upon subsequent grantees of the
promisor unless certain well-defined and long-established legal requisites are
satisfied

(Nicholson v. 300 Broadway Realty Corp., 164 N.E.2d 832, 834
(N.Y. 1959); Neponsit Prop. Owners’ Assn. v. Emigrant Ind. Sav. Bank, 15

N.E.2d 793 , 794–95 (N.Y. 1938); see, also, Morgan Lake Co.
v. New York, New Haven & Hartford R.R. Co., 186 N.E. 685, 687 (N.Y. 1933);

Miller v. Clary, 103 N.E. 1114 (N.Y. 1913); Mygatt v. Coe,
42 N.E. 17 (N.Y. 1895); 13 N.Y.Jur., Covenants and Restrictions, § 12, pp.
252–253).

In the landmark Neponsit case (supra), we adopted and
clarified the following test, originating in the early English decisions, for
the

enforceability of affirmative covenants (cf. Spencer’s Case,
77 Eng. Rep. 72 (K.B. 1583)), and reaffirmed the requirements that in order for
a

covenant to run with the land, it must be shown that:

#1045

(1)The original grantee and grantor must have intended that
the covenant run with the land.

(2)There must exist “privity of estate” between the party
claiming the benefit of the covenant and the right to enforce it and the

party upon whom the burden of the covenant is to be imposed.

(3)The covenant must be deemed to “touch and concern” the
land with which it runs.

Even though the parties to the original deed expressly state
in the instrument that the covenant will run with the land, such a recital is

insufficient to render the covenant enforceable against
subsequent grantees if the other requirements for the running of an affirmative
covenant

are not met. The rule is settled that “[r]egardless of the
intention of the parties, a covenant will run with the land and will be
enforceable against a

subsequent purchaser of the land at the suit of one who
claims the benefit of the covenant, only if the covenant complies with certain
legal

requirements” (Neponsit, supra, 15 N.E.2d p. 795; see, also,
Morgan Lake Co. v. New York, New Haven & Hartford R.R. Co. , supra, 262 186

N.E. p. 686 ). Thus, although the intention of the original
parties here is clear and privity of estate exists, the covenant must still
satisfy the

requirement that it “touch and concern” the land.

It is this third prong of the tripartite rule which presents
the obstacle to appellant’s position and which was the focus of our decisions
in

Neponsit and Nicholson v. 300 Broadway Realty Corp. (164
N.E. 2d 832, 834, supra). Neponsit first sought to breathe substance and
meaning

into the ritualistic rubric that an affirmative covenant
must “touch and concern” the land in order to be enforceable against subsequent
grantees.

Observing that it would be difficult to devise a rule which
would operate mechanically to resolve all situations which might arise, Judge
Lehman

observed that “the distinction between covenants which run
with land and covenants which are personal, must depend upon the effect of the

covenant on the legal rights which otherwise would flow from
the ownership of land and which are connected with the land” (Neponsit, 15

N.E.2d p. 796). Thus, he posed as the key question whether
“the covenant in purpose and effect substantially alter[s] these rights” (15
N.E.2d p.

796). In Nicholson , this court reaffirmed the soundness of
the reasoning in Neponsit as “a more realistic and pragmatic approach” (supra,
164

N.E.2d p. 835). * * *

A close examination of the covenant in the case before us
leads to the conclusion that it does not substantially affect the ownership
interest

of landowners in the Orchard Hill subdivision. The covenant
provides for the supplying of water for only six months of the year; no claim
has

been advanced by appellant that the lands in the subdivision
would be waterless without the water it supplies. Indeed, the facts here point
to the

converse conclusion since respondent has obtained his own
source of water. The record, based on and consisting of an agreed stipulation
of

#1046

facts, does not demonstrate that other property owners in
the subdivision would be deprived of water from appellant or that the price of
water

would become prohibitive for other property owners if
respondent terminated appellant’s service. Thus, the agreement for the seasonal
supply of

water does not seem to us to relate in any significant
degree to the ownership rights of respondent and the other property owners in
the

subdivision of Orchard Hill. The landowners in Neponsit
received an easement in common to utilize public areas in the subdivision; this
interest

was in the nature of a property right attached to their
respective properties. The obligation to receive water from appellant resembles
a personal,

contractual promise to purchase water rather than a
significant interest attaching to respondent’s property. It should be
emphasized that the

question whether a covenant is so closely related to the use
of the land that it should be deemed to “run” with the land is one of degree,

dependent on the particular circumstances of a case
(Neponsit, supra, 15 N.E.2d p. 796). Here, the meager record before us is
lacking and

woefully insufficient to establish that the covenant
“touches and concerns” the land, as we have interpreted that requirement.

There is an additional reason why we are reluctant to
enforce this covenant for the seasonal supply of water. The affirmative
covenant is

disfavored in the law because of the fear that this type of
obligation imposes an “undue restriction on alienation or an onerous burden in

perpetuity” ( Nicholson v. 300 Broadway Realty Corp. , 164
N.E.2d 832, 835, supra). In Nicholson , the covenant to supply heat was not
interdicted

by this concern because it was conditioned upon the
continued existence of the buildings on both the promisor’s and the promisee’s
properties.

Similarly, in Neponsit , the original 1917 deed containing
the covenant to pay an annual charge for the maintenance of public areas
expressly

provided for its own lapse in 1940. Here, no outside
limitation has been placed on the obligation to purchase water from appellant.
Thus, the

covenant falls prey to the criticism that it creates a
burden in perpetuity, and purports to bind all future owners, regardless of the
use to which the

land is put. Such a result militates strongly against its
enforcement. On this ground also, we are of the opinion that the covenant
should not be

enforced as an exception to the general rule prohibiting the
“running” of affirmative covenants. * * *

Order affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Does _Eagle Enterprises_ clarify the legal meaning of
“touch and concern” in any respect beyond the exposition in _Neponsit_? Why
doesn’t the

promise to take water from the common well in return for a
fee satisfy Professor Bigelow’s definition—altering the advantages and burdens
of owning

particular tracts of land—endorsed in _Neponsit_?

```



2 .Why did this covenant fail the touch and concern test? If
there were visible pipes to bring the water to the land, would that serve as
notice to



```

```

```

successors? What if every house had a pipe leading to the
central source? Is the problem that the later deeds did not contain the
covenant? What if the

developer had filed a plan for the entire subdivision
containing the restrictions? Does _Eagle Enterprises_ suggest that touch and
concern functions as a

kind of changed circumstances doctrine? For discussion, see
Stake, supra.

3 .What if each of the owners had also covenanted not to dig
wells? Would the covenant to purchase water then touch and concern?

4 .Should servitudes on personal property run to successive
owners? The running of servitudes is more of an issue in the case of land
because it

lasts much longer than typical personal property. The law
has reflected some suspicion of servitudes on personal property, often without
a clear

articulation for the reasons. See Zechariah Chafee, Jr.,
Equitable Servitudes on Chattels, 41 Harv. L. Rev. 945 ( 1928 ). Unlike land,
where servitudes

address spillovers that affect identifiable neighbors,
personal property servitudes often restrict use or the terms of resale of an
item of personal property.

Mostly the law has regulated these in terms of antitrust.
See Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park, 220 U.S. 373 ( 1911 ), overruled on other
grounds, Leegin

Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877
( 2007 ). The issue of servitudes on personal property has gained more
prominence recently

with the increased importance of intellectual property. See
Glen O. Robinson, Personal Property Servitudes, 71 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1449 ( 2004
). The

arrangement in _ProCD v. Zeidenberg_ , see Chapter IV, was
in effect a sale of the software coupled with a servitude; the seller intended
the restriction on

the use of the software to bind any successor owner of the
software as well. Patent owners sometimes impose single-use only restrictions
that are meant

to override a default license in the buyer to repair an
item. Should holders of IP rights be able to contract for servitudes that will
run with some property,

tangible or intangible? An alternative to such servitudes
would be to license the IP rights themselves and include the restrictions in
the terms of the

license. If so, should the result be any different?

d.NOTICE AND THE COMMON PLAN

One of the requirements for covenants to run in equity is
notice. If A personally deals with B, notice is an automatic by-product. In

subdivisions, though, covenants trace back to a deal between
the developer and the original purchasers, not directly between the purchasers

themselves. Such a procedure saves greatly on transaction
costs if what is desired is a set of interlocking identical mutual covenants.
For a group

of 100 parcels, the developer can substitute 100 similar
covenants as part of the package on offer, as opposed to the 4,950 deals
required for each

parcel owner to covenant with each of the 99 others. Things
can still go wrong, as in the following case.

#1048

#### Sanborn v. McLean

```



Supreme Court of Michigan, 1925.



206 N.W. 496.



```

■ WIEST,
J. Defendant Christina McLean owns the west 35 feet of lot 86 of Green Lawn
subdivision, at the northeast corner of Collingwood

avenue and Second boulevard, in the city of Detroit, upon
which there is a dwelling house, occupied by herself and her husband, defendant
John

A. McLean. The house fronts Collingwood avenue. At the rear
of the lot is an alley. Mrs. McLean derived title from her husband, and, in the

course of the opinion, we will speak of both as defendants.
Mr. and Mrs. McLean started to erect a gasoline filling station at the rear end
of their

lot, and they and their contractor, William S. Weir, were
enjoined by decree from doing so and bring the issues before us by appeal. Mr.
Weir will

not be further mentioned in the opinion.

Collingwood avenue is a high grade residence street between
Woodward avenue and Hamilton boulevard, with single, double, and

apartment houses, and plaintiffs, who are owners of land
adjoining and in the vicinity of defendants’ land, and who trace title, as do
defendants,

to the proprietors of the subdivision, claim that the
proposed gasoline station will be a nuisance per se, is in violation of the
general plan fixed for

use of all lots on the street for residence purposes only,
as evidenced by restrictions upon 53 of the 91 lots fronting on Collingwood
avenue, and

that defendants’ lot is subject to a reciprocal negative
easement barring a use so detrimental to the enjoyment and value of its
neighbors.

Defendants insist that no restrictions appear in their chain
of title and they purchased without notice of any reciprocal negative easement,
and

deny that a gasoline station is a nuisance per se. We find
no occasion to pass upon the question of nuisance, as the case can be decided
under the

rule of reciprocal negative easement.

This subdivision was planned strictly for residence
purposes, except lots fronting Woodward avenue and Hamilton boulevard. The 91
lots

on Collingwood avenue were platted in 1891, designed for and
each one sold solely for residence purposes, and residences have been erected

upon all of the lots. Is defendants’ lot subject to a
reciprocal negative easement? If the owner of two or more lots, so situated as
to bear the

relation, sells one with restrictions of benefit to the land
retained, the servitude becomes mutual, and, during the period of restraint,
the owner of

the lot or lots retained can do nothing forbidden to the
owner of the lot sold. For want of a better descriptive term this is styled a
reciprocal

negative easement. It runs with the land sold by virtue of
express fastening and abides with the land retained until loosened by
expiration of its

period of service or by events working its destruction. It
is not personal to owners, but operative upon use of the land by any owner
having actual

or constructive notice thereof. It is an easement passing
its benefits and carrying its obligations to all purchasers of land, subject to
its affirmative

or negative mandates. It originates for mutual benefit and
exists with

#1049

vigor sufficient to work its ends. It must start with a
common owner. Reciprocal negative easements are never retroactive; the very
nature of their

origin forbids. They arise, if at all, out of a benefit
accorded land retained, by restrictions upon neighboring land sold by a common
owner. Such

a scheme of restriction must start with a common owner; it
cannot arise and fasten upon one lot by reason of other lot owners conforming
to a

general plan. If a reciprocal negative easement attached to
defendants’ lot, it was fastened thereto while in the hands of the common owner
of it

and neighboring lots by way of sale of other lots with
restrictions beneficial at that time to it. This leads to inquiry as to what
lots, if any, were

sold with restrictions by the common owner before the sale
of defendants’ lot. While the proofs cover another avenue, we need consider
sales

only on Collingwood.

December 2 8, 1892, Robert J. and Joseph R. McLaughlin, who
were then evidently owners of the lots on Collingwood avenue, deeded lots

37 to 41 and 58 to 62, inclusive, with the following
restrictions:

No residence shall be erected upon said premises which shall
cost less than $2,500, and nothing but residences shall be erected

upon said premises. Said residences shall front on Helene
(now Collingwood) avenue and be placed no nearer than 20 feet from the

front street line.

July 24, 1893, the McLaughlins conveyed lots 17 to 21 and 78
to 82, both inclusive, and lot 98 with the same restrictions. Such restrictions

were imposed for the benefit of the lands held by the
grantors to carry out the scheme of a residential district, and a restrictive
negative easement

attached to the lots retained, and title to lot 86 was then
in the McLaughlins. Defendants’ title, through mesne conveyances, runs back to
a deed

by the McLaughlins dated September 7, 189 3, without
restrictions mentioned therein. Subsequent deeds to other lots were executed by
the

McLaughlins, some with restrictions and some without.
Previous to September 7, 1893, a reciprocal negative easement had attached to
lot 86 by

acts of the owners, as before mentioned, and such easement
is still attached and may now be enforced by plaintiffs, provided defendants,
at the

time of their purchase, had knowledge, actual or
constructive, thereof. The plaintiffs run back with their title, as do
defendants, to a common

owner. This common owner, as before stated, by restrictions
upon lots sold, had burdened all the lots retained with reciprocal
restrictions.

Defendants’ lot and plaintiff Sanborn’s lot, next thereto,
were held by such common owner, burdened with a reciprocal negative easement,
and,

when later sold to separate parties, remained burdened
therewith, and right to demand observance thereof passed to each purchaser with
notice of

the easement.

#1050

Figure 9-10

Sanborn Fire Insurance Map of Area in

Sanborn v. McLean

_Source_ : 9 Sanborn Map Co., Insurance Maps of Detroit,
Michigan, No. 12 (1925).

The restrictions were upon defendants’ lot while it was in
the hands of the common owners, and abstract of title to defendants’ lot showed

the common owners, and the record showed deeds of lots in
the plat restricted to perfect and carry out the general plan and resulting in
a

reciprocal negative easement upon defendants’ lot and all
lots within its scope, and defendants and their predecessors in title were
bound by

constructive notice under our recording acts. The original
plan was repeatedly declared in subsequent sales of lots by restrictions in the
deeds,

and, while some lots sold were not so restricted, the
purchasers thereof, in every instance, observed the general plan and purpose of
the

restrictions in building residences. For upward of 30 years
the united efforts of all persons interested have carried out the common
purpose of

making and keeping all the lots strictly for residences, and
defendants are the first to depart therefrom.

#1051

When Mr. McLean purchased on contract in 1910 or 191 1,
there was a partly built dwelling house on lot 86, which he completed and now

occupies. He had an abstract of title which he examined and
claims he was told by the grantor that the lot was unrestricted. Considering
the

character of use made of all the lots open to a view of Mr.
McLean when he purchased, we think, he was put thereby to inquiry, beyond
asking

his grantor, whether there were restrictions. He had an
abstract showing the subdivision and that lot 86 had 97 companions. He could
not avoid

noticing the strictly uniform residence character given the
lots by the expensive dwellings thereon, and the least inquiry would have
quickly

developed the fact that lot 86 was subjected to a reciprocal
negative easement, and he could finish his house, and, like the others, enjoy
the

benefits of the easement. We do not say Mr. McLean should
have asked his neighbors about restrictions, but we do say that with the notice
he

had from a view of the premises on the street, clearly
indicating the residences were built and the lots occupied in strict accordance
with a

general plan, he was put to inquiry, and, had he inquired,
he would have found of record the reason for such general conformation, and the

benefits thereof serving the owners of lot 86 and the
obligations running with such service and available to adjacent lot owners to
prevent a

departure from the general plan by an owner of lot 86.

While no case appears to be on all fours with the one at
bar, the principles we have stated, and the conclusions announced, are
supported by

Allen v. City of Detroit, 133 N. W. 317 (Mich. 191 1);
McQuade v. Wilcox, 183 N. W. 771 (Mich. 1921); French v. White Star Refining
Co., 201

N. W. 444 (Mich. 1924); Silberman v. Uhrlaub, 102 N. Y. S.
299 (N.Y. App. Div. 1907); Boyden v. Roberts, 111 N. W. 701 (Wis. 1907);

Howland v. Andrus, 83 A. 982 (N.J. Ch. 1912).

We notice the decree in the circuit directed that the work
done on the building be torn down. If the portion of the building constructed
can

be utilized for any purpose within the restrictions, it need
not be destroyed.

With this modification, the decree in the circuit is
affirmed, with costs to plaintiffs.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The court here refers to the promises as “negative
reciprocal easements,” but what it is talking about would more commonly be
called covenants

or equitable servitudes today. You will find that the
terminology used by courts exhibits some variability here (as elsewhere).

2 .Some courts do not go as far as the Michigan Supreme
Court in recognizing the common plan doctrine. Some would not imply reciprocal

negative easements at all, see, e.g., Riley v. Bear Creek
Planning Comm., 551 P. 2 d 1213 (Cal. 1976 ), and others require a high
proportion of the lots to

have been sold with the restrictions, see, e.g., Whitton v.
Clark, 151 A. 305 (Conn. 1930 ). The language in _Sanborn_ if taken literally
would imply a

```



1052



```

restriction based on the sale of one lot with the
restriction. Another variable is the degree of uniformity of the restrictions
required for a court to find a

common scheme or plan. See Restatement (Third) of Property:
Servitudes § 2. 14 ( 2000 ) (allowing common plan to be found even with some
variation

in restrictions). Notice that the likelihood that a
purchaser will have notice is greatly increased if her individual deed makes
reference to a recorded

subdivision map. Restrictions incorporated in this way will
satisfy even the strictest courts’ standards for notice.

3 .Recall that restrictions not appearing in the land
records make title searches more difficult. The restrictions on neighboring
parcels here were not

in the McLeans’ chain of title. Instead, in the court’s
view, Mr. McLean had inquiry notice based on the uniformity of the
neighborhood. If such

uniformity could arise spontaneously, would there then be a
need for covenants or for zoning (which did not exist in Detroit at the time
this case arose)?

Should the subsequent rise of zoning affect a court’s
willingness to find inquiry notice in this scenario?

#### Bolotin v. Rindge

```



District Court of Appeal, Second District, Division 3 ,
California, 1964.



41 Cal.Rptr. 376.



```

■ FILES,
JUSTICE. This is an action for declaratory relief and to quiet title against
tract-wide deed restrictions which limit the use of plaintiffs’

property to single family residential purposes. The trial
court gave judgment declaring the restrictions to be unenforceable in part.
Defendants

have appealed. It is necessary to reverse the judgment
because of the absence of a finding of fact on an issue which must be resolved
before the

controversy can be decided.

Plaintiffs own an unimproved lot situated at the northeast
corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Hudson Avenue in the City of Los Angeles.

This lot is a part of a tract which was subdivided by G.
Allen Hancock in 1923 in the area now known as Hancock Park. Defendants are
owners

of other lots in the same tract. All the lots in the tract
are subject to deed restrictions imposed by the original subdivider. These
restrictions

require, among other things, that each lot shall be used
solely for single, private residences and that each residence shall front on a
northsouth

street. These restrictions will expire January 1, 1970. All
the lots in the tract except four have been improved with single family
residences. The

four lots which have never been improved are the northeast
and northwest corners of Wilshire and Hudson, and the two lots which are

immediately north of the two corner lots.

#1053

Figure 9-1 1

Hudson Avenue Looking Toward

Wilshire Boulevard, 2006

As this photograph reveals, the undeveloped northeast corner
lots at issue in _Bolotin_ are now occupied by a substantial commercial
building, as are the companion lots

across the street.

There is no dispute that the Hancock Park area is one of the
most desirable and expensive residential areas in the community. It is also

undisputed that the character of Wilshire Boulevard has
changed greatly since 1923. A stipulation of facts lists these changes in some
detail.

Plaintiffs’ evidence also includes the testimony of a
qualified real estate broker and appraiser who testified that in his opinion
plaintiffs’ lot was

not suitable for single family residential use, that there
was no commonsense use to which the property could be put so long as the deed

restrictions remained, and that the highest and best use for
the property would be a commercial building similar to others which have been
built

on Wilshire Boulevard, both east and west of the subject
property. He expressed the opinion that such a development would have no
adverse

effect upon either the market values of the residences in
the tract or upon the amenities of living there. In his opinion, a building on
plaintiffs’ lot

would help to protect the residences from the noise of the
Wilshire traffic. There is an office building on the south side of Wilshire
whose parking

lot is directly across the street from plaintiff’s lot. The
witness pointed out that the use of plaintiffs’ property for a commercial
building would

bring the commercial influence only 100 feet closer to the
defendants’ residences.

Defendants produced the testimony of a real estate broker
that an office building on plaintiffs’ lot would make the residences in the
tract

much less desirable as homes. In his opinion, a commercial
building

#1054

would inevitably bring more traffic and more parking, and
would shut out sunlight. Defendants’ witness was also of the opinion that the
market

value of the residences would decrease if a commercial
building were built on plaintiffs’ lot.

The findings of fact made by the trial court consist of
these two paragraphs:

The changes in the uses of property abutting Wilshire
Boulevard in the vicinity of lot 212 of tract 6388 in the City of Los Angeles

and the increase of vehicular traffic on said boulevard
along said lot, have resulted in said lot having no substantial value solely
for

single family residential purposes, but said lot has a
market value in excess of $200,000.00 for business uses.

The refusal to enforce the single family residence
restriction and the prohibition of commercial use of said lot 212, contained in

the deeds to said lot and adjacent lots issued in 1923 and
subsequent thereto, will not have an adverse effect upon the market value of

other lots in said tract or tract 7040.

The only formal conclusion of law made by the trial court
was that plaintiffs are entitled to a judgment declaring that the deed
restrictions

are not enforceable in specified respects.

A court will declare deed restrictions to be unenforceable
when, by reason of changed conditions, enforcement of the restrictions would be

inequitable and oppressive, and would harass plaintiff
without benefiting the adjoining owners. (Wolff v. Fallon, 284 P.2d 802 (Cal.
1955).) In

that case there was a finding of fact, supported by expert
testimony, that the use of the plaintiff’s property for commercial purposes
would not

detrimentally affect the adjoining property or neighborhood.
A judgment quieting title against the restrictions was affirmed.

In Marra v. Aetna Construction Co. , 101 P.2d 490 (Cal.
1940), at pages 492–493, the court said:

Also well recognized is the rule that a building restriction
in the nature of a servitude will not be enforced where changed conditions in

the neighborhood have rendered the purpose of the
restrictions obsolete. [Citations.] But, if the original purpose of the
covenant can

still be realized, it will be enforced even though the
unrestricted use of the property would be more profitable to its owner.

In that case the evidence showed that the lot for whose
benefit the restriction had been imposed was no longer being used for
residential

purposes, and hence the Supreme Court concluded it was no
longer equitable to restrict the servient lot to residential purposes.

The difficulty in the present case is that there is no
finding that the purposes of the restrictions have become obsolete, or that the

#1055

enforcement of the restrictions on the plaintiffs’ property
will no longer benefit the defendants. The trial court’s finding as to the
effect upon

defendants is limited to the statement that there will be no
adverse effect upon market value. This is not the test.

The purpose of the deed restrictions, it seems clear enough,
was to preserve the tract as a fine residential area by excluding from the
tract

many of the activities which might be offensive to the
residents or which would create noise, traffic, congestion, or other conditions
which would

lessen the comfort and enjoyment of the residents. Bringing
the prohibited activities into the neighborhood might or might not depreciate
the

market value of the homes. If the restrictions should be
broken, and a commercial building erected on the Wilshire frontage, speculators
might be

willing to pay more for the other parcels in anticipation of
future expansion of the commercial development. Thus the intrusion of an office

building might increase market values even though it
offended the senses of the residents and destroyed the physical conditions
which had made

their neighborhood a desirable one for them.

In Miles v. Clark , 187 P. 167 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1919),
at p. 1 72, where a decree enjoining a breach of deed restrictions was
affirmed, the

court said:

The fact that apart from and surrounding the tract some
business has grown up, and that the land has become more valuable in

consequence, in no manner entitles defendants to be relieved
of the restrictions they have created. This condition is but the natural

result of the improvement of the various tracts, and the
fact that the property may have become more valuable thereby for business

purposes is immaterial. [Citations.] Courts in such cases
are not controlled exclusively by money value, but may protect a home.

Plaintiffs have not cited any cases in which deed
restrictions have been held unenforceable upon findings which were limited to
the

economic consequences.^1 In Hirsch v. Hancock , 343 P.2d 959
(Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1959), a case which plaintiffs characterize as “strikingly

similar” to this one, the court granted relief against the
deed restrictions on the property at the northeast corner of Wilshire Boulevard
and

Rossmore

#1056

Avenue. The trial court in that case found that the
enforcement of the restrictions would be of no substantial benefit to the
owners of the other

lots in the tract. That finding of fact distinguishes that
case from the present one. There is no suggestion in the Hirsch case that the
courts are

concerned only with economic benefits.

* * * It is for the trial court to resolve this issue of
      fact.

The judgment is reversed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Hancock Park was developed in the 1920 s as a high-end
residential neighborhood. The deed restrictions on the lots included racial
restrictions,

minimum lot sizes of 15 , 000 square feet, and requirements
that the lots be devoted to single-family use. See Robert C. Ellickson, Stale
Real Estate

Covenants (August 21 , 2020 ), available at
[http://dx.doi.org/](http://dx.doi.org/) 10. 2139 / ssrn. 3678927. As Wilshire
Boulevard developed into a thoroughfare, some owners

of lots in Hancock Park along Wilshire opted to keep their
lots vacant until 1970 , when the restrictions would expire, hoping that the
city might rezone

to permit commercial use. This eerie stretch of land became
known as the “Dead Mile,” a reference to the “Miracle Mile” immediately to the
west, a

developed commercial strip. As of 2020 , most of Hancock
Park is zoned for single-family residential use and requires lots of at least
15 , 000 square feet,

and the median value of Hancock Park homes is now around
five million dollars. Id. Does this change your view of how the case should
have come out,

or does it suggest the court was correct in assessing that
the restrictions still carried substantial value for residents? Should an
analysis of changed

circumstances address considerations beyond whether the
restrictions still benefit the adjoining owners?

2 .The problem of changed circumstances is a general one.
What is special about the covenants here is that many have an interest in their

enforcement. How does this situation compare to the cy pres
cases discussed in Chapter VI?

3 .How else might the problem of stability versus
flexibility over time be handled? Some covenants contain sunset provisions.
Sometimes the

judicial doctrine of changed circumstances is applied, and
in a few states covenants are time-limited by statute. See Robert C. Ellickson
et al., Land Use

Controls: Cases and Materials 532 – 36 ( 5 th ed. 2021 ).
Would purchasers systematically make mistakes in this area?

4 .If courts were more inclined to refuse enforcement of
covenants at the edges of an area, what should happen when the owners on the
new

commercial-residential divide invoke changed circumstances?
Might this explain the court’s reluctance to intervene here?

#### Peckham v. Milroy

```



Court of Appeals of Washington, 2001.



17 P. 3 d 1256.



```

■
SWEENEY, J. A neighborhood covenant prohibits home businesses. So, the trial
court enjoined Thomas Milroy’s wife from operating a home

day care after [a] neighbor complained.

The question before us is whether the trial court erred by
enjoining the day-care business because the covenant was abandoned, or violated

public policy. The trial court’s findings are amply
supported by the evidence here. And those findings amply support the court’s
conclusions of

law that the covenant had not been abandoned through disuse.
Nor does it violate public policy. We also agree that neither laches nor
estoppel

bars Mr. Peckham’s claim here. We, therefore, affirm the
court’s summary dismissal.

FACTS

The material facts are not disputed. Spokane Terrace was
platted in 1907. It includes the houses at issue here. The neighborhood is
called

the Spokane Terrace Addition (STA). The developer subjected
some of the lots to restrictive covenants in 1955. One prohibited use of the

property “for business purposes of any kind whatsoever... .”
Clerk’s Papers at 38.

Gordon Peckham moved into the STA in 1958. Thomas Milroy’s
parents moved into the STA in 1992. The Milroy property is subject to the

restriction.

Mr. Milroy’s mother fell and broke her hip in 1994. She
required assistance after that. Mr. Milroy, his wife, and family decided to
move into

his mother’s home in the STA.

They remodeled the home to accommodate the Milroy family,
which included five children. They began to remodel in August 1995 and

completed in December 1995. Mr. Peckham watched and
photographed the construction. He complained to the county about the
construction in

November 1 995. And he filed zoning complaints in February
1996. The Milroys moved into the home in December 1995. Mrs. Milroy obtained

a day-care license and began running a day care.

The children are noisy. Mr. Peckham can hear them from
inside his home. Parents of the children parked in front of Mr. Peckham’s
house.

They walk across his yard. And they park in the alley behind
his house.

Mr. Milroy’s mother passed away in July 1996. He inherited
the home. Mr. Peckham told Mrs. Milroy she was violating the covenants in

July 1996. Mr. Peckham sued to enjoin the day-care operation
in November 1997.

Several home businesses operated in the STA in violation of
the restrictive covenant. These include a drapery business, a painting
business,

a small construction business, and a TV repair service.

#1058

Following a trial the court concluded that Mrs. Milroy’s day
care was a business. And that Mr. Peckham had an equitable right to enforce

the covenant. The court enjoined the Milroys from operating
the day care.

ANALYSIS

ABANDONMENT.

Mr. Milroy first argues the covenant prohibiting home
businesses has been abandoned.

Abandonment requires proof that prior violations have eroded
the general plan and enforcement is therefore inequitable. Mountain Park

Homeowners Ass’n v. Tydings, 883 P.2d 1383, 1386 (Wash.
1994). A covenant is abandoned when it has been “habitually and substantially

violated... .” Id. But a few violations do not constitute
abandonment. White v. Wilhelm, 665 P.2d 407, 411 (Wash. App. 1983).

Mr. Milroy presented evidence of four home businesses in the
STA. A drapery business has been run from a home in the STA since the late

1970s. A painting business was run from 1994 to 1997. A
small construction and TV repair business was operated between 1963 and 1972.
And

a craft business has been operated from a home for the past
five to six years.

The STA covers 41 blocks and includes approximately 38 to 40
lots each. The violations are neither habitual nor substantial. See Mountain

Park Homeowners, supra. They comprise a very small
percentage of the subdivision. A few violations do not constitute abandonment.
White,

supra.

Substantial evidence supports the trial court’s
determination that the covenant has not been abandoned.

LACHES AND ESTOPPEL.

Mr. Milroy next contends that Mr. Peckham knew Mrs. Milroy
intended to operate a home day care as early as August 1995. Yet Mr.

Peckham waited until November 1997 to file this action. The
delay caused injury to the Milroys and was therefore unreasonable.

Laches. Laches requires: “(1) knowledge or reasonable
opportunity to discover on the part of a potential plaintiff that he has a
cause of

action against a defendant; (2) an unreasonable delay by the
plaintiff in commencing that cause of action; (3) damage to defendant resulting
from

the unreasonable delay.” Buell v. City of Bremerton, 495
P.2d 1358, 1361 (Wash. 1972); see Valley View Indus. Park v. City of Redmond,
733

P.2d 182, 191 (Wash. 1987).

Mr. Peckham saw the Milroys remodel. But he did not know
they intended to build a day-care center until after the construction started.
The

Milroys incurred construction expenses before Mr. Peckham
knew they intended to violate the covenant.

#1059

Mr. Peckham objected to the project through early 1996. Mr.
Peckham tried to enlist the aid of the county to stop the day-care operation.
He

told Mrs. Milroy that she was violating the covenants in
July 1996.

Mr. Milroy testified that the original purpose of remodeling
was to provide room for his family, not a commercial day care. Mr. Milroy

stated he and his wife did not originally plan to continue
the day-care service. But then they decided they needed the money. He testified
the

decision to operate the day care was made in late 1995,
after remodeling the home.

The defense of laches requires showing all three elements.
See Buell, supra. The Milroys intended to remodel for reasons other than the
day

care. The cost of the remodel could not, then, result from
Mr. Peckham’s delay in bringing this action.

The court found that Mr. Peckham did not unreasonably delay
the suit. That finding is amply supported by this record.

Equitable Estoppel. Equitable estoppel requires: “(1) an
admission, statement or act inconsistent with the claim asserted afterward; (2)

action by the other party in reasonable reliance on that
admission, statement or act; and (3) injury to that party when the first party
is allowed to

contradict or repudiate its admission, statement or act.”
Wilhelm v. Beyersdorf, 999 P.2d 54, 62 (Wash. App. 2000). Each element must be
proven

by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. Id. Equitable
estoppel is not favored. Robinson v. City of Seattle, 830 P.2d 318, 345 (Wash.
1992).

Mr. Milroy has not established any of the elements of
equitable estoppel. Mr. Peckham made no statements and he took no actions

inconsistent with his current position—the day care violates
the covenant.

Mr. Milroy argues that Mr. Peckham acquiesced to the day
care through his silence. Silence can lead to equitable estoppel—“[w]here a

party knows what is occurring and would be expected to
speak, if he wished to protect his interest, his acquiescence manifests his
tacit consent.”

Bd. of Regents v. City of Seattle, 741 P.2d 11 , 16 (Wash.
1987). Mr. Peckham was not silent. He complained to the county. He complained
to

Mrs. Milroy.

Neither can the Milroys show that they relied on Mr.
Peckham’s acquiescence. Mrs. Milroy talked to representatives of the city,
county, and

state about the day-care operation. She did not rely on Mr.
Peckham. * * * [The court then upholds the trial court’s determination that the

character of the neighborhood had not changed for purposes
of the doctrine of changed neighborhood conditions.]

#1060

PUBLIC POLICY.

Mr. Milroy argues that Washington public policy makes
quality child care a priority. And this public policy should override
restrictive

covenants preventing home day care.

Mr. Milroy cites statutes which prohibit cities, towns, and
counties from prohibiting home day care in residentially zoned areas. RCW

35.63.185; RCW 36.70A.450. The regulations do not, however,
limit private parties from restricting land use. Restrictive covenants in
residential

neighborhoods are enforceable. Metzner v. Wojdyla, 886 P.2d
154, 156–57 (Wash. 1994).

If restrictive covenants that incidentally prohibit home day
care should be repealed on public policy grounds, the decision should come from

the Legislature—not this court. See Mut. of Enumclaw Ins.
Co. v. Wiscomb, 622 P.2d 1234, 1236–37 (Wash. 1980) (determining public policy
is

not the judiciary’s function).

Affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .We have seen abandonment and estoppel before. How are
they similar or different in the context of covenants?

2 .One might ask whether covenants can be _created_ by
estoppel. In general, there are no covenants by estoppel, implication, or
prescription. Why?

Do covenants typically deal with matters as serious as those
involved in easements?

3 .The Court of Appeals declined to find these covenants
against public policy, but that argument met a very different response in
_Taylor v.

Northam_ , which held that the governor of Virginia could
abrogate a covenant that required the state to hold a monument to Confederate
general Robert

E. Lee and the land on which it stood “perpetually sacred to
the monumental purpose to which it has been devoted.” 862 S.E. 2 d 458 , 461
(Va. 2021 ).

After owners in the neighboring area sued to require the
state to continue displaying the monument, the Supreme Court of Virginia found
that the

covenant was terminated both by changed conditions and as
against public policy. In discussing changed conditions, the court noted that
in the time

since the covenant was drafted in 1890 , both Virginia and
federal courts invalidated many laws valorizing the pre-Civil-War way of life
in the American

South. It cited _Shelley v. Kraemer_ , supra Chapter IV, and
other decisions striking down devices meant to reinforce racial subordination.
As for public

policy, the court recited that “applicable public policy for
a given time may be gathered from the enactments of the legislative branch, the
expressions of

the executive branch, and the opinions of this Court.” Id.
at 469. Even if there were not a law expressly authorizing the Governor to
remove the

monument, the Virginia Supreme Court would have found the
state’s other recent removals of monuments, the elimination of a holiday
honoring Lee,

and broader concerns about compelling particular government
speech sufficient justifications for terminating the covenant. It rejected the

```



1061



```

owners’ argument that Virginia’s public policy in favor of
historic preservation supported the covenant’s continued enforcement. What
sources of

evidence for “public policy” should courts take into
account—broad public sentiment, specific legislation, or constitutional values?
Cf. Skutt v. Grand

Rapids, 266 N.W. 344 (Mich. 1936 ) (defining public policy
as “community common sense and common conscience”). How should a court evaluate
a

covenant that purports to ban the display of flags or

4 .Courts in different states have reached different
conclusions about whether covenants that have been abrogated by the state
require the payment

of compensation pursuant to state or federal takings clauses
(see Chapter X). See Glen O. Robinson, Explaining Contingent Rights: The Puzzle
of

“Obsolete” Covenants, 91 Colum. L. Rev. 546 , 563 ( 1991 ).
Should the government have to pay when it expressly changes public policy in a
way that

abrogates covenants? Several states have passed laws
terminating covenants that ban solar panels, see, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §
33 – 439 A ( 2007 ), or

“accessory dwelling units” that expand housing on a
particular lot, see Cal. Civ. Code § 4751 ( 2020 ).

Conservation Easements

Perhaps the fastest growing type of covenant in the United
States is the conservation easement. According to one estimate, the amount of

land in the United States subject to conservation easements
exploded from very little in 1980 to over 56 million acres by 2015. Land Trust

Alliance, 2015 National Land Trust Census Report, at
http://s3. amazonaws.com/landtrustalliance.org/2015NationalLandTrustCensus
Report.pdf.

Conservation easements are servitudes that restrict the
future development of land. The most common type of restriction prohibits
subdivision

and commercial development but permits existing agricultural
and residential uses. Conservation easements come in a wide variety of forms,

however, ranging from prohibitions on cutting timber to
requiring the preservation of historic building facades.

The term “conservation easement” is something of a misnomer
in that these restrictions are more accurately classified as negative covenants

in gross. They are negative because they prohibit the
servient landowner from engaging in certain kinds of activities; they are
probably more

accurately described as covenants rather than easements
because they do not fit any of the traditional four categories of negative
easements; and

they are in gross because the power to enforce the
restriction is typically given not to another landowner but to a unit of local
government or a

charitable land trust like the Nature Conservancy. A
negative covenant in gross probably would not run with the land at common law.
It could not

be enforced as a real covenant, since the privity

#1062

requirements would not be met. And courts generally refused
to enforce covenants in gross as equitable servitudes; only appurtenant
covenants

were eligible for enforcement against successors with
notice. See Gerald Korngold, Privately Held Conservation Servitudes: A Policy
Analysis

in the Context of In Gross Real Covenants and Easements, 63
Tex. L. Rev. 433, 470–79 (1984). Conservation easements therefore exist only

because of legislation specifically authorizing them. Today
virtually all states have enacted conservation easement laws, about half of
which are

based on the Uniform Conservation Easement Act promulgated
in 1981. See Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes § 1.3, cmt. a &

Statutory Note. In this sense, conservation easements are
another example of a new form of property being created by legislation,
consistent with

the idea of the numerus clausus.

There appear to be multiple forces driving the rapid
proliferation of conservation easements. First, many owners of land with
significant

aesthetic and environmental value worry about these lands
succumbing to pressure for subdivision or commercial development. Of course, as

long as the owners are living and hold the land in fee
simple, they can reject the entreaties of developers. But many owners are
apprehensive that

the family farm, or woodlot, or waterfront retreat will be
sold by their heirs or otherwise fall into the hands of developers after they
die. A

perpetual conservation easement is designed to “give
peace-of-mind to current landowners worried about the future of a beloved
property,

whether forest or ranch, stretch of river or family farm.”
The Nature Conservancy, Conservation Easements: All About Conservations

Easements, at http:// http://www. nature. org/ about us/
private lands conservation/ conservation easements/ all- about- conservation-
easements. xml. In this

sense, the impulse behind the movement for conservation
easements is reminiscent of the aspirations of the English landed gentry to
keep their

country houses in the family in perpetuity.

Second, there are significant tax benefits to donating a
conservation easement to a local unit of government or a charitable land trust.
It is no

accident that the boom in conservation easements started
after the Internal Revenue Code was amended in 1976 specifically to permit tax-

deductible donations of such interests. See IRC § 170(h).
The instrument of donation must provide that the land is being restricted for
one of

several general purposes: outdoor recreation, wildlife
habitat, scenic enjoyment, agricultural use, or historical importance. And the
donation must

be “perpetual.” If these requirements are met, the landowner
can deduct from her income taxes the difference between the appraised value of
the

land in an unrestricted state and the value of the land as
restricted. Meanwhile, the landowner can continue to own the land in fee
simple, pass it

to heirs, or even sell it, subject to the restriction. Many
states also provide that landowners are entitled to a reduction in property
taxes to reflect

the lower assessed value of the property after the
restriction is in place. There are no reliable data on the total amount of
deductions

#1063

claimed for conservation easements, but according to one
estimate “the charitable value of claimed donations nationwide was in the

neighborhood of $20.7 billion from 2001 to 2003.” Dominic P.
Parker, Conservation Easements: A Closer Look at Federal Tax Policy 10 (PERC

Policy Series, October 2005).

Third, many environmentalists, particularly those concerned
about preserving local environmental values, have seen conservation easements

as a potentially powerful tool in combating new commercial
development. Traditional regulatory tools for fighting developers, such as
restrictive

zoning laws, encounter fierce resistance from particular
landowners and developers and generate expensive litigation over regulatory
takings

claims (see Chapter X). Conservation easements are the
product of a voluntary agreement between a landowner and a unit of local
government or

a land trust, and hence encounter little or no opposition.
Moreover, insofar as conservation easements are financed, at least in
significant part, by

off-budget tax benefits given to landowners, they do not
encounter the same type of public scrutiny that would be given to direct
government

acquisition of new parkland or nature preserves. See
generally, Symposium, Perpetual Conservation Easements in the 21st Century,
2013 Utah L.

Rev. 1.

The rapid emergence of conservation easements has not gone
unnoticed, and is beginning to generate critical commentary. Julia Mahoney

has written that the perpetual nature of conservation
easements raises some of the same concerns about dead hand control we have seen
in other

contexts, such as the rule against restraints on alienation
and the Rule against Perpetuities. See Julia D. Mahoney, Perpetual Restrictions
on Land

and the Problem of the Future, 88 Va. L. Rev. 739 (2002).
She writes that conservation easements reflect a kind of hubris that “the
ability of the

present generation to predict the needs and preferences of
future generations is so good that the present generation should save their
descendants

trouble and transaction costs by making a substantial number
of land use decisions for them.” Id. at 744. In addition, making easements
perpetual

presupposes that decisions about land use are irreversible,
such that “the present generation represents nature’s last or near-to-last
chance,

because once land is developed, it will never or almost
never go back to being undeveloped.” Id. at 745. This, she says, is contrary to
historical

experience, and reflects naiveté about “the instability of
the categories of ‘development’ and ‘preservation.’ ” Id.

The use of generous tax deductions to spur conservation
easements has also encountered criticism as leading to abuses and poor
planning.

Despite safeguards in the tax code and regulations, many
donors have overvalued conservation easements and taken deductions out of line
with

public benefits. See, e.g., Timothy Lindstrom, Income Tax
Aspects of Conservation Easements, 5 Wyo. L. Rev. 1, 17–18 (2005). On the
benefit

side, an exposé by two reporters for the Washington Post
reported that conservation easements have been used to generate tax deductions
for

#1064

real estate developers in circumstances where it is doubtful
that any public benefit is created. See Joe Stephens & David B. Ottaway,
Developers

Find Payoff in Preservation, Washington Post, Dec. 21, 2003,
at A1. For example, some developers have built homes around a golf course and

have then deducted the value of a donated conservation
easement in the golf course fairways. Others have pointed out the tax deduction
strategy

results in a pattern of expenditures that favors horse
farms, trophy ranches, Nantucket cottages, and other getaways of the wealthy,
which may

not be the best way to allocate resources for conservation
of environmentally and historically significant resources. For example,
preserving land

for hiking or as habitat may require the preservation of
multiple contiguous parcels of land, whereas conservation easements generate
only a

scattershot pattern of preserved lands. Despite some
subsequent efforts to address these problems by tightening requirements and
improving

appraisals, no broader reforms have been enacted, and abuses
continue. See K. King Burnett, John D. Leshy & Nancy A. McLaughlin,
Building

Better Conservation Easements for America the Beautiful,
Harv. Envtl. L. Rev. Online (Sept. 15, 2021) https:// papers.ssrn.com/ sol3/
papers.cfm?

abstract_id=3925094.

Finally, some traditional environmentalists have objected to
conservation easements on the ground that they deprive the public of any input

into the development of conservation policy. See, e.g., John
D. Echeverria, Revive the Legacy of Land Use Controls, 2 Open Space 12 (Summer

2004). Conservation easements represent a strategy of
providing a type of public good (e.g., environmental amenities) by private
contract. This

largely eliminates any role for public input or oversight
into decisions about what to preserve and what sorts of public access will be
provided to

the resources subject to preservation controls. Since the
public is paying for the conservation, both directly through tax subsidies and
indirectly

through foregone development opportunities, the public
should have some say into the process. Instead, conservation easements are
created

through private negotiations between landowners and land
trusts, typically with no notice to the public even after they have been
created.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Because of the voluntary nature of conservation
easements, their creation is rarely accompanied by litigation. Over time,
however, conflicts

inevitably arise over the interpretation and enforcement of
these agreements. These are usually resolved by interpreting the language of
the easement or

the authorizing statute. See, e.g., Ephrata Area School
Dist. v. County of Lancaster, 938 A. 2 d 264 (Pa. 2007 ) (question whether
consent of easement

holder was required to construct a public access road across
an open space easement to reach a newly constructed school); Tennessee
Environmental

Council, Inc. v. Bright Par 3 Assocs., L.P., No. E 2003 -
01982 - COA-R 3 - CV, 2004 WL 419720 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004 ) (question whether

```



1065



```

members of the public have standing to seek enforcement of a
conservation easement).

2 .Although the major objections to conservation easements
relate to their perpetual nature, the use of tax subsidies, and the lack of
public

oversight, these objections are interrelated. For example,
the Internal Revenue Code provides that a donation will be deductible only if
the easement is

“perpetual.” Why might Congress be reluctant to allow
deductions for time-limited conservation easements? The IRS will allow an
easement to be

extinguished in the future if a change in conditions makes
it “impractical or impossible” for the easement to serve its intended purpose,
and if the funds

acquired in extinguishing the easement are used for a
conservation purpose similar to the one initially intended by the easement.
Treas. Reg. § 1. 170 A–

14 (c)( 2 ). Should a citizens’ group have standing to
intervene in a proceeding before the IRS to challenge either a finding that an
easement had become

“impractical or impossible” or the proposed use of the
proceeds? See Carol Necole Brown, A Time to Preserve: A Call for Formal
Private-Party Rights

in Perpetual Conservation Easements, 40 Ga. L. Rev. 85 (
2005 ) (advocating a broad right of private party standing).

3 .Would you favor imposing some time limitation on
conservation easements? What about subjecting such easements to the equitable
doctrine of

cy pres (see Chapter VI)? See Gerald Korngold, Solving the
Contentious Issues of Private Conservation Easements: Promoting Flexibility for
the Future

and Engaging the Public Land Use Process, 2007 Utah L. Rev.
1039 ; Nancy A. McLaughlin, Rethinking the Perpetual Nature of Conservation

Easements, 29 Harv. Envtl. L. Rev. 421 ( 2005 ). Would these
reforms reduce the incentives of persons to make donations of such easements?

### C. ZONING AND OTHER LAND-USE REGULATION

These days the main source of land-use control of a public
character is zoning and related land-use regulation. Zoning in the United
States

arose in the early twentieth century in response to the
perceived inadequacies of nuisance and covenants to secure a stable regime of
residential

land use in a rapidly urbanizing country.

Zoning is the regulation of land uses through a general
regime permitting and forbidding particular uses of land in certain locations.
In a

proto-zoning period in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, a number of municipalities adopted ordinances prohibiting
a select few

uses—for example, brick making in a residential area. Modern
zoning ordinances, which are far more comprehensive, date from the landmark

New York Zoning Ordinance of 1916. This prescribed three
zones—residence, business, and unrestricted; today New York City’s zoning

ordinance provides for 176 use districts. Contemporary
zoning also covers matters such as lot size and shape, and building bulk and
placement.

There are several types of zoning, including more recently
zoning that involves a contract-like deal between developers and local
government.

When reading the following materials ask yourself to what
extent zoning is public or private law or some mixture of the two. Related

#1066

to this is the question of how great an impact zoning has on
owner sovereignty—and how far it should.

Zoning of the type familiar today, which governs the types
of uses to which parcels may be put, took off in the 1920s. Interestingly,
zoning

was heavily supported by some developers, particularly those
of “high class” housing. Zoning originally targeted nuisances but now commonly

zoning makes fine distinctions among uses and often also
restricts height, bulk, area, and exterior design. As we will see, these
measures can

sometimes be used to keep out those who cannot afford large
lots and large houses. The earliest zoning often explicitly targeted
characteristics of

the user (rather than just the use), and was used to enforce
racial and economic segregation. In Buchanan v. Warley , 245 U.S. 60 (1917),
the

Supreme Court struck down such schemes as violating the
Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee not to be deprived of the right to dispose of

property without due process of law—in that case the white
seller’s right to dispose of the property by selling to black people. (The
lawsuit was a

challenge by the local president of the NAACP, William
Warley, and a white realtor friendly to the NAACP, Charles Buchanan, by having

Buchanan sell to Warley on condition that Warley be able to
occupy, and then having Warley breach and claim the condition as excusing

performance.) The Louisville ordinance at issue in the case
was designed to maintain segregation between whites and blacks and forbade any

person from occupying a house on a block in which the
majority of the other houses were occupied by members of the other race. See
Benno C.

Schmidt, Jr., Principle and Prejudice: The Supreme Court and
Race in the Progressive Era, Part 1: The Heyday of Jim Crow, 82 Colum. L. Rev.

444, 498–523 (1982). We take up more subtle racial and class
effects of zoning later in this Section.

Zoning ordinances and the apparatus for giving them effect
are a matter of state and local law. Because local governments are creatures of

their respective states, the authority to engage in zoning
must come from the state. States can delegate the police power in the area of
zoning to

local governments. State constitutions or legislation,
termed “home rule” provisions, can give some or all local governments sweeping
powers to

regulate, and zoning is within this broad authorization. Or
the state can pass a zoning enabling act setting out the authority of local
governments

to act in this area.

Consider the typical zoning enabling act. Such legislation
calls for a comprehensive plan. In many states, this requirement is in practice
easy

to meet, because the plan need not be in writing, or it is
sometimes considered to be implicit in the zoning ordinance. Under the enabling
act,

relevant local governments—county commissions, city
councils, etc.—are authorized to and expected to pass a zoning ordinance. Under
such an

ordinance, people can seek changes in zoning designations,
but there is a danger that individually tailored adjustments will be attacked
as

unlawful “spot zoning.” In general, it is fair to say that
those envisioning

#1067

the workings of zoning at the time it came into being
seriously underestimated the dynamic aspect of land-use planning. Implementing
change in

a zoning scheme is not an easy process.

Under zoning, permits are commonly required for
subdivisions, site plans, and building projects. A designated local official
will be in

charge of granting and denying requests for building
permits, and the official will enforce the provisions of the zoning ordinance
in the process of

considering the request for a permit. Those dissatisfied
with a denial of a permit, as well as those aggrieved by the granting of a
permit, and

certain other officials can appeal to a Board of Zoning
Appeals, which can carry one of several similar sounding names and which
reviews these

decisions but cannot make changes in basic zoning
designations themselves. Consider who is likely to have enough of a stake and
low enough

organizing costs to be able to mount effective opposition to
a zoning decision. Developers and neighbors often fit this description, but
those who

might become residents in the future are much less likely to
have their voices heard directly.

The Board of Zoning Appeals not only hears appeals from
denials of building permits but also hears requests for variances (which allow
for

relaxation of zoning requirements in cases of undue
hardship), and hears requests for special approvals (which go under various
other names as

well, such as “special exceptions,” “special permits,” and
“conditional uses,” and which permit uses only if conditions specified in the
ordinance

are met). The difference between a variance and a special
approval is that if one satisfies criteria set forth in the zoning ordinance,
one has a right

to a special approval, whereas a variance is given for
special hardship as determined within a broad grant of discretion to the Board
under the

ordinance. Aggrieved landowners can seek judicial review of
the Board’s decision in the regular state courts. Variances and special
approvals can

be termed “flexibility tools.” See generally Restatement
(Fourth) of Property, Vol. 7, Div. I, Ch. 6 (Am. L. Inst. Council Draft No. 3,
Sept. 29,

2020).

Violators of zoning ordinances are theoretically liable for
civil and criminal sanctions, although enforcement is sometimes spotty. Recall
the

ex ante versus ex post discussion in connection with
building encroachments (see Chapter IV). Should those who have already built in
violation

of zoning be required to tear the offending structure down,
even at great cost? Sometimes this happens. In early 2020, a New York trial
court

judge ordered the developers of a condominium building to
remove twenty completed floors found to exceed what was permitted under zoning

law, though the decision was ultimately overturned on
appeal. See Stefanos Chen, Judge Orders Nearly Built Tower to Lose About 20
Floors,

N.Y. Times, Feb. 14, 2020, at A25; Comm. for Environmentally
Sound Dev. v. Amsterdam Ave. Redevelopment Assocs. LLC, 144 N.Y.S.3d 1

(App. Div. 2021). In Naples, Florida, a building approved by
the County Commission in violation of a comprehensive plan was

#1068

demolished under court order. Aisling Swift, Florida Courts
Agree: If Buildings Violate Laws, They Must Be Razed, Naples Daily News, Sept.
5,

florida-courts-agree-if-buildings-violate-laws-they-must-be-razed-ep-405826699-330950031.
html.

In the courts, the Board of Zoning Appeals is treated like a
quasi-judicial administrative agency in that principles of due process and

administrative law apply. Principally challenges to zoning
are based on due process (substantive and procedural), the takings clause
(state and/or

federal), equal protection, free speech, free association,
and freedom of religion. We return to some of these issues later in this
Section.

Zoning comes in a number of varieties, one of which is
called “Euclidean” after the scheme in the following case.

#### Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.

```



Supreme Court of the United States, 1926.



272 U.S. 365.



```

■ MR.
JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court. The village of Euclid is
an Ohio municipal corporation. It adjoins and practically

is a suburb of the city of Cleveland. Its estimated
population is between 5,000 and 10,000, and its area from 12 to 14 square
miles, the greater

part of which is farm lands or unimproved acreage. It lies,
roughly, in the form of a parallelogram measuring approximately three and
one-half

miles each way. East and west it is traversed by three
principal highways: Euclid Avenue, through the southerly border, St. Clair
Avenue, through

the central portion, and Lake Shore Boulevard, through the
northerly border, in close proximity to the shore of Lake Erie. The Nickel
Plate

Railroad lies from 1,500 to 1,800 feet north of Euclid
Avenue, and the Lake Shore Railroad 1,600 feet farther to the north. The three
highways

and the two railroads are substantially parallel.

Appellee is the owner of a tract of land containing 68
acres, situated in the westerly end of the village, abutting on Euclid Avenue
to the

south and the Nickel Plate Railroad to the north. Adjoining
this tract, both on the east and on the west, there have been laid out
restricted

residential plats upon which residences have been erected.

On November 13, 1922, an ordinance was adopted by the
village council, establishing a comprehensive zoning plan for regulating and

restricting the location of trades, industries, apartment
houses, two-family houses, single family houses, etc., the lot area to be built
upon, the size

and height of buildings, etc.

The entire area of the village is divided by the ordinance
into six classes of use districts, denominated U-1 to U-6, inclusive; three
classes of

height districts, denominated H-1 to H-3, inclusive; and
four classes of area districts, denominated A–1 to A–4, inclusive. The use
districts are

#1069

classified in respect of the buildings which may be erected
within their respective limits, as follows: U-1 is restricted to single family
dwellings,

public parks, water towers and reservoirs, suburban and
interurban electric railway passenger stations and rights of way, and farming,
non-

commercial greenhouse nurseries, and truck gardening; U-2 is
extended to include two-family dwellings; U-3 is further extended to include

apartment houses, hotels, churches, schools, public
libraries, museums, private clubs, community center buildings, hospitals,
sanitariums, public

playgrounds, and recreation buildings, and a city hall and
courthouse; U-4 is further extended to include banks, offices, studios,
telephone

exchanges, fire and police stations, restaurants, theaters
and moving picture shows, retail stores and shops, sales offices, sample rooms,

wholesale stores for hardware, drugs, and groceries,
stations for gasoline and oil (not exceeding 1,000 gallons storage) and for ice
delivery,

skating rinks and dance halls, electric substations, job and
newspaper printing, public garages for motor vehicles, stables and wagon sheds
(not

exceeding five horses, wagons or motor trucks), and
distributing stations for central store and commercial enterprises; U-5 is
further extended to

include billboards and advertising signs (if permitted),
warehouses, ice and ice cream manufacturing and cold storage plants, bottling
works,

milk bottling and central distribution stations, laundries,
carpet cleaning, dry cleaning, and dyeing establishments, blacksmith,
horseshoeing,

wagon and motor vehicle repair shops, freight stations,
street car barns, stables and wagon sheds (for more than five horses, wagons or
motor

trucks), and wholesale produce markets and salesroom; U-6 is
further extended to include plants for sewage disposal and for producing gas,

garbage and refuse incineration, scrap iron, junk, scrap
paper, and rag storage, aviation fields, cemeteries, crematories, penal and
correctional

institutions, insane and feeble-minded institutions, storage
of oil and gasoline (not to exceed 25,000 gallons), and manufacturing and
industrial

operations of any kind other than, and any public utility
not included in, a class U-1, U-2, U-3, U-4, or U-5 use. There is a seventh
class of uses

which is prohibited altogether.

Class U-1 is the only district in which buildings are
restricted to those enumerated. In the other classes the uses are
cumulative-that is to say,

uses in class U-2 include those enumerated in the preceding
class U-1; class U-3 includes uses enumerated in the preceding classes, U-2,
and U-

1; and so on. In addition to the enumerated uses, the
ordinance provides for accessory uses; that is, for uses customarily incident
to the principal

use, such as private garages. Many regulations are provided
in respect of such accessory uses.

The height districts are classified as follows: In class
H-1, buildings are limited to a height of two and one-half stories, or
thirty-five feet; in

class H-2, to 4 stories, or fifty feet; in class H-3, to
eighty feet. To all of these, certain exceptions are made, as in the case of
church spires, water

tanks, etc.

#1070

The classification of area districts is: In A–1 districts,
dwellings or apartment houses to accommodate more than one family must have at

least 5,000 square feet for interior lots and at least 4,000
square feet for corner lots; in A– 2 districts, the area must be at least 2,500
square feet

for interior lots, and 2,000 square feet for corner lots; in
A–3 districts, the limits are 1,250 and 1,000 square feet, respectively; in A–4
districts,

the limits are 900 and 700 square feet, respectively. The
ordinance contains, in great variety and detail, provisions in respect of width
of lots,

front, side, and rear yards, and other matters, including
restrictions and regulations as to the use of billboards, signboards, and
advertising signs.

A single family dwelling consists of a basement and not less
than three rooms and a bathroom. A two-family dwelling consists of a

basement and not less than four living rooms and a bathroom
for each family, and is further described as a detached dwelling for the
occupation

of two families, one having its principal living rooms on
the first floor and the other on the second floor.

Appellee’s tract of land comes under U-2, U-3 and U-6. The
first strip of 620 feet immediately north of Euclid Avenue falls in class U-2,
the

next 130 feet to the north, in U-3, and the remainder in
U-6. The uses of the first 620 feet, therefore, do not include apartment
houses, hotels,

churches, schools, or other public and semipublic buildings,
or other uses enumerated in respect of U-3 to U-6, inclusive. The uses of the
next

130 feet include all of these, but exclude industries,
theaters, banks, shops, and the various other uses set forth in respect of U-4
to U-6, inclusive.

Annexed to the ordinance, and made a part of it, is a zone
map, showing the location and limits of the various use, height, and area
districts,

from which it appears that the three classes overlap one
another; that is to say, for example, both U-5 and U-6 use districts are in A–4
area

district, but the former is in H-2 and the latter in H-3
height districts. The plan is a complicated one, and can be better understood
by an

inspection of the map * * *

The lands lying between the two railroads for the entire
length of the village area and extending some distance on either side to the
north

and south, having an average width of about 1,600 feet, are
left open, with slight exceptions, for industrial and all other uses. This
includes the

larger part of appellee’s tract. Approximately one-sixth of
the area of the entire village is included in U-5 and U-6 use districts. That
part of the

village lying south of Euclid avenue is principally in U-1
districts. The lands lying north of Euclid Avenue and bordering on the long
strip just

described are included in U-1, U-2, U-3, and U-4 districts,
principally in U-2.

Zoning of Properties near the Ambler Realty Tract

_Source_ : Timothy Alan Fluck, _Euclid v. Ambler_ : A
Retrospective, 52 J. Am. Planning Ass’n 326, 329, Map 2 (Summer 1986).

The enforcement of the ordinance is entrusted to the
inspector of buildings, under rules and regulations of the board of zoning
appeals.

Meetings of the board are public, and minutes of its
proceedings are kept. It is authorized to adopt rules and regulations to carry
into effect

provisions of the ordinance. Decisions of the inspector of
buildings may be appealed to the board by any person claiming to be adversely
affected

by any such decision. The board is given power in specific
cases of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship to interpret the
ordinance in

harmony with its general purpose and intent, so that the
public health, safety and general welfare may be secure and substantial justice
done.

Penalties are prescribed for violations, and it is provided
that the various provisions are to be regarded as independent and the holding
of any

provision to be unconstitutional, void or ineffective shall
not affect any of the others.

The ordinance is assailed on the grounds that it is in
derogation of § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution in
that it

deprives appellee of liberty and property without due
process of law and denies it the equal protection of the law, and that it
offends against

certain provisions of the Constitution of the state of Ohio.
The prayer of the bill is for an injunction restraining the enforcement of the
ordinance

and all attempts to impose or maintain as to appellee’s
property any of the restrictions, limitations or conditions. The court below
held the

ordinance to be unconstitutional and void, and enjoined its
enforcement, 297 F. 307.

Before proceeding to a consideration of the case, it is
necessary to determine the scope of the inquiry. The bill alleges that the
tract of land

in question is vacant and has been held for years for the
purpose of selling and developing it for industrial uses, for which it is
especially adapted,

being immediately in the path of progressive industrial
development;

#1072

that for such uses it has a market value of about $10,000
per acre, but if the use be limited to residential purposes the market value is
not in

excess of $2,500 per acre; that the first 200 feet of the
parcel back from Euclid Avenue, if unrestricted in respect of use, has a value
of $150 per

front foot, but if limited to residential uses, and ordinary
mercantile business be excluded therefrom, its value is not in excess of $50
per front

foot.

It is specifically averred that the ordinance attempts to
restrict and control the lawful uses of appellee’s land, so as to confiscate
and destroy

a great part of its value; that it is being enforced in
accordance with its terms; that prospective buyers of land for industrial,
commercial, and

residential uses in the metropolitan district of Cleveland
are deterred from buying any part of this land because of the existence of the
ordinance

and the necessity thereby entailed of conducting burdensome
and expensive litigation in order to vindicate the right to use the land for
lawful and

legitimate purposes; that the ordinance constitutes a cloud
upon the land, reduces and destroys its value, and has the effect of diverting
the

normal industrial, commercial, and residential development
thereof to other and less favorable locations.

The record goes no farther than to show, as the lower court
found, that the normal and reasonably to be expected use and development of

that part of appellee’s land adjoining Euclid Avenue is for
general trade and commercial purposes, particularly retail stores and like

establishments, and that the normal and reasonably to be
expected use and development of the residue of the land is for industrial and
trade

purposes. Whatever injury is inflicted by the mere existence
and threatened enforcement of the ordinance is due to restrictions in respect
of these

and similar uses, to which perhaps should be added—if not
included in the foregoing—restrictions in respect of apartment houses.
Specifically

there is nothing in the record to suggest that any damage
results from the presence in the ordinance of those restrictions relating to
churches,

schools, libraries, and other public and semipublic
buildings. It is neither alleged nor proved that there is or may be a demand
for any part of

appellee’s land for any of the last-named uses, and we
cannot assume the existence of facts which would justify an injunction upon
this record in

respect to this class of restrictions. For present purposes
the provisions of the ordinance in respect of these uses may therefore be put
aside as

unnecessary to be considered. It is also unnecessary to
consider the effect of the restrictions in respect of U-1 districts, since none
of appellee’s

land falls within that class. * * *

Building zone laws are of modern origin. They began in this
country about twenty-five years ago. Until recent years, urban life was

comparatively simple; but, with the great increase and
concentration of population, problems have developed, and constantly are
developing,

which require, and will continue to require, additional
restrictions in respect of the use and occupation of private lands in urban
communities.

#1073

Regulations, the wisdom, necessity, and validity of which,
as applied to existing conditions, are so apparent that they are now uniformly

sustained, a century ago, or even half a century ago,
probably would have been rejected as arbitrary and oppressive. Such regulations
are

sustained, under the complex conditions of our day, for
reasons analogous to those which justify traffic regulations, which, before the
advent of

automobiles and rapid transit street railways, would have
been condemned as fatally arbitrary and unreasonable. And in this there is no

inconsistency, for, while the meaning of constitutional
guaranties never varies, the scope of their application must expand or contract
to meet the

new and different conditions which are constantly coming
within the field of their operation. In a changing world it is impossible that
it should be

otherwise. But although a degree of elasticity is thus
imparted, not to the meaning , but to the application of constitutional
principles, statutes and

ordinances, which, after giving due weight to the new
conditions, are found clearly not to conform to the Constitution, of course,
must fall.

The ordinance now under review, and all similar laws and
regulations, must find their justification in some aspect of the police power,

asserted for the public welfare. The line which in this
field separates the legitimate from the illegitimate assumption of power is not
capable of

precise delimitation. It varies with circumstances and
conditions. A regulatory zoning ordinance, which would be clearly valid as
applied to the

great cities, might be clearly invalid as applied to rural
communities. In solving doubts, the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas ,
which lies

at the foundation of so much of the common law of nuisances,
ordinarily will furnish a fairly helpful clew. And the law of nuisances,
likewise,

may be consulted, not for the purpose of controlling, but
for the helpful aid of its analogies in the process of ascertaining the scope
of, the power.

Thus the question whether the power exists to forbid the
erection of a building of a particular kind or for a particular use, like the
question

whether a particular thing is a nuisance, is to be
determined, not by an abstract consideration of the building or of the thing
considered apart, but

by considering it in connection with the circumstances and
the locality. A nuisance may be merely a right thing in the wrong place, like a
pig in

the parlor instead of the barnyard. If the validity of the
legislative classification for zoning purposes be fairly debatable, the
legislative judgment

must be allowed to control.

There is no serious difference of opinion in respect of the
validity of laws and regulations fixing the height of buildings within
reasonable

limits, the character of materials and methods of
construction, and the adjoining area which must be left open, in order to
minimize the danger of

fire or collapse, the evils of overcrowding and the like,
and excluding from residential sections offensive trades, industries and
structures likely to

create nuisances.

Here, however, the exclusion is in general terms of all
industrial establishments, and it may thereby happen that not only offensive or

#1074

dangerous industries will be excluded, but those which are
neither offensive nor dangerous will share the same fate. But this is no more
than

happens in respect of many practice-forbidding laws which
this court has upheld, although drawn in general terms so as to include
individual

cases that may turn out to be innocuous in themselves. The
inclusion of a reasonable margin, to insure effective enforcement, will not put
upon a

law, otherwise valid, the stamp of invalidity. Such laws may
also find their justification in the fact that, in some fields, the bad fades
into the good

by such insensible degrees that the two are not capable of
being readily distinguished and separated in terms of legislation. In the light
of these

considerations, we are not prepared to say that the end in
view was not sufficient to justify the general rule of the ordinance, although
some

industries of an innocent character might fall within the
proscribed class. It cannot be said that the ordinance in this respect “passes
the bounds of

reason and assumes the character of a merely arbitrary
fiat.” Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, 226 U.S. 192, 204 (1912). Moreover, the
restrictive

provisions of the ordinance in this particular may be
sustained upon the principles applicable to the broader exclusion from
residential districts of

all business and trade structures, presently to be
discussed.

It is said that the village of Euclid is a mere suburb of
the city of Cleveland; that the industrial development of that city has now
reached and

in some degree extended into the village, and in the obvious
course of things will soon absorb the entire area for industrial enterprises;
that the

effect of the ordinance is to divert this natural
development elsewhere, with the consequent loss of increased values to the
owners of the lands

within the village borders. But the village, though
physically a suburb of Cleveland, is politically a separate municipality, with
powers of its own

and authority to govern itself as it sees fit, within the
limits of the organic law of its creation and the state and federal
Constitutions. Its governing

authorities, presumably representing a majority of its
inhabitants and voicing their will, have determined, not that industrial
development shall

cease at its boundaries, but that the course of such
development shall proceed within definitely fixed lines. If it be a proper
exercise of the police

power to relegate industrial establishments to localities
separated from residential sections, it is not easy to find a sufficient reason
for denying

the power because the effect of its exercise is to divert an
industrial flow from the course which it would follow, to the injury of the
residential

public, if left alone, to another course where such injury
will be obviated. It is not meant by this, however, to exclude the possibility
of cases

where the general public interest would so far outweigh the
interest of the municipality that the municipality would not be allowed to
stand in the

way.

We find no difficulty in sustaining restrictions of the kind
thus far reviewed. The serious question in the case arises over the provisions
of

the ordinance excluding from residential districts apartment
houses, business houses, retail stores and shops, and other like
establishments.

#1075

This question involves the validity of what is really the
crux of the more recent zoning legislation, namely, the creation and
maintenance of

residential districts, from which business and trade of
every sort, including hotels and apartment houses, are excluded. Upon that
question this

court has not thus far spoken. The decisions of the state
courts are numerous and conflicting; but those which broadly sustain the power
greatly

outnumber those which deny it altogether or narrowly limit
it, and it is very apparent that there is a constantly increasing tendency in
the

direction of the broader view. * * *

The matter of zoning has received much attention at the
hands of commissions and experts, and the results of their investigations have
been

set forth in comprehensive reports. These reports which bear
every evidence of painstaking consideration, concur in the view that the
segregation

of residential, business and industrial buildings will make
it easier to provide fire apparatus suitable for the character and intensity of
the

development in each section; that it will increase the
safety and security of home life, greatly tend to prevent street accidents,
especially to

children, by reducing the traffic and resulting confusion in
residential sections, decrease noise and other conditions which produce or
intensify

nervous disorders, preserve a more favorable environment in
which to rear children, etc. With particular reference to apartment houses, it
is

pointed out that the development of detached house sections
is greatly retarded by the coming of apartment houses, which has sometimes

resulted in destroying the entire section for private house
purposes; that in such sections very often the apartment house is a mere
parasite,

constructed in order to take advantage of the open spaces
and attractive surroundings created by the residential character of the
district.

Moreover, the coming of one apartment house is followed by
others, interfering by their height and bulk with the free circulation of air
and

monopolizing the rays of the sun which otherwise would fall
upon the smaller homes, and bringing, as their necessary accompaniments, the

disturbing noises incident to increased traffic and
business, and the occupation, by means of moving and parked automobiles, of
larger portions

of the streets, thus detracting from their safety and
depriving children of the privilege of quiet and open spaces for play, enjoyed
by those in more

favored localities,—until, finally, the residential
character of the neighborhood and its desirability as a place of detached
residences are utterly

destroyed. Under these circumstances, apartment houses,
which in a different environment would be not only entirely unobjectionable but
highly

desirable, come very near to being nuisances.

If these reasons, thus summarized, do not demonstrate the
wisdom or sound policy in all respects of those restrictions which we have

indicated as pertinent to the inquiry, at least, the reasons
are sufficiently cogent to preclude us from saying, as it must be said before
the

ordinance can be declared unconstitutional, that such
provisions are clearly

#1076

arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation
to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.

It is true that when, if ever, the provisions set forth in
the ordinance in tedious and minute detail, come to be concretely applied to
particular

premises, including those of the appellee, or to particular
conditions, or to be considered in connection with specific complaints, some of
them,

or even many of them, may be found to be clearly arbitrary
and unreasonable. But where the equitable remedy of injunction is sought, as it
is

here, not upon the ground of a present infringement or
denial of a specific right, or of a particular injury in process of actual
execution, but upon

the broad ground that the mere existence and threatened
enforcement of the ordinance, by materially and adversely affecting values and

curtailing the opportunities of the market, constitute a
present and irreparable injury, the court will not scrutinize its provisions,
sentence by

sentence, to ascertain by a process of piecemeal dissection
whether there may be, here and there, provisions of a minor character, or
relating to

matters of administration, or not shown to contribute to the
injury complained of, which, if attacked separately, might not withstand the
test of

constitutionality. In respect of such provisions, of which
specific complaint is not made, it cannot be said that the landowner has
suffered or is

threatened with an injury which entitles him to challenge
their constitutionality. * * *

The relief sought here is of the same character, namely, an
injunction against the enforcement of any of the restrictions, limitations, or

conditions of the ordinance. And the gravamen of the
complaint is that a portion of the land of the appellee cannot be sold for
certain enumerated

uses because of the general and broad restraints of the
ordinance. What would be the effect of a restraint imposed by one or more of
the

innumerable provisions of the ordinance, considered apart,
upon the value or marketability of the lands, is neither disclosed by the bill
nor by the

evidence, and we are afforded no basis, apart from mere
speculation, upon which to rest a conclusion that it or they would have any
appreciable

effect upon those matters. Under these circumstances,
therefore, it is enough for us to determine, as we do, that the ordinance in
its general scope

and dominant features, so far as its provisions are here
involved, is a valid exercise of authority, leaving other provisions to be
dealt with as cases

arise directly involving them.

And this is in accordance with the traditional policy of
this Court. In the realm of constitutional law, especially, this Court has
perceived the

embarrassment which is likely to result from an attempt to
formulate rules or decide questions beyond the necessities of the immediate
issue. It

has preferred to follow the method of a gradual approach to
the general by a systematically guarded application and extension of
constitutional

principles to particular cases as they arise, rather than by
out of hand attempts to establish general rules to which future cases must be
fitted. This

process applies with peculiar force to the solution of
questions

#1077

arising under the due process clause of the Constitution as
applied to the exercise of the flexible powers of police, with which we are
here

concerned.

Decree reversed.

JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER, MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS, and MR. JUSTICE BUTLER dissent.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Euclid’s scheme involved cumulative zoning; that is, the
ordinance defined a hierarchy of uses, roughly from most sensitive and least
invasive

to those that are least sensitive but most objectionable to
others. In any zone of a given level, one can have uses of that level or any
“higher” use. Thus,

as in Euclid, one could if one wished build a residence in
an industrial zone but not vice versa. By contrast, in noncumulative zoning one
can only have

enumerated uses in any given zone. So unless it happened to
be an allowable mixture, one would not be permitted to build a residence in an
industrial

zone. Which scheme is preferable in your view?

2 .As with any scheme there is some limit as to how
finegrained zoning can be, in an ex ante sense. As we saw in the case of
area-wide covenants,

borders between areas or zones tend to present problems. In
Euclid, before the zoning, residences on the edge of the zone might be less
desirable

because of the prospect of nearby industry. In fact, the
zoning in some sense creates the reverse “externality” at the zoning border
(the actual border

being within the tract that straddles the border), in that
the restriction to residences makes nearby valuable industrial use less viable.
Ambler wanted to

use the entire tract for industrial use, but the owners of
the residential tracts wanted to see industrial development nearby blocked.
What would a unitary

owner of all the land in the area likely want to do?
Incidentally, under the pressure of wartime industrial mobilization Euclid
later rezoned the entire area

for industrial use and a GM plant long occupied the site
after World War II. Since 1999 a portion of the by then shut-down plant was
converted into a

sports facility, and the area now features a mixture of
commercial, industrial, and residential uses. See Ellickson et al., supra, at
112.

3 .When land-use regulations are analyzed—especially under
the Takings Clause, as we will see—analogies are often drawn to nuisance.
Although

nuisance law itself is not the primary tool of
externality-control these days, it forms for better or worse a common
vocabulary and possible baseline for

evaluating the bads that stem from land use. _Euclid_ is no
exception. What do you think of Justice Sutherland’s invocation of the notion
of nuisance? Are

apartment houses nuisances? Are duplexes (U- 2 ) nuisances
to owners of single-family homes (U- 1 )? For that matter, why do you think
Justice

Sutherland, one of the “Four Horsemen” of the pre- 1937
Supreme Court, would uphold the zoning scheme here at issue in the face of the
claims of a

private property owner? See Barry Cushman, The Secret Lives
of the Four Horsemen, 83 Va. L. Rev. 559 ( 1997 ) (arguing that the Four
Horsemen were

“closet liberals”). The other Horsemen (Justices Butler,
McReynolds,

```



1078



```

and Van Devanter) were in dissent in _Euclid_. For a summary
of views on Sutherland’s reasons, see Ellickson et al., supra, at 110.

4 .Are apartment buildings “parasites,” as Justice
Sutherland would have it? By contrast, the trial court in _Euclid_ was highly
critical of the

exclusionary and class-segregating aspect of zoning. The
ordinance was innovative in keeping out apartment buildings, with the result of
segregation by

class and race. By upholding this kind of zoning, the
Supreme Court’s decision made zoning an available tool for exclusion. On the
background of racial

zoning in the Cleveland area in this era and the attitudes
of those involved in the _Euclid_ case, see William M. Randle, Professors,
Reformers,

Bureaucrats, and Cronies: The Players in _Euclid v. Ambler_
, in Zoning and the American Dream 31 , 38 – 43 (Charles M. Haar & Jerrold
S. Kayden eds.,

1989 ).

5 .After _Euclid_ and _Nectow v. City of Cambridge_ , 277
U.S. 183 ( 1928 ) (striking down on due process grounds the residential
designation of a

parcel pursuant to zoning), the Supreme Court has had little
to say about the constitutionality of zoning schemes under the Takings and Due
Process

Clauses. Much more happens at the state level, under state
constitutions, and state courts vary greatly in how deferential they are to
local zoning

authorities. For example, Illinois and Pennsylvania are
stricter than most about due process in the area of zoning.

6 .Zoning is not the only public tool of land-use control.
Also important are subdivision controls, which regulate new subdivisions, and
prescribe

features of streets, utility lines, and other public
infrastructure and amenities—and deal with more obvious externalities.
Environmental laws and

regulations can have major consequences for land use.
Federal environmental laws like the Clean Water Act or Endangered Species Act
can limit use of

parcels. And some states require environmental impact
statements for major new developments.

Nonconforming Uses

Zoning ordinances typically grandfather nonconforming uses
of property in existence when a zoning scheme is enacted. For example, a

commercial establishment in a residential area will be
allowed to continue. Widespread intuition has it that once a use of property is
established it

becomes a “vested right.” In contrast, before a zoning law
is adopted an owner of undeveloped land has no vested right to any particular
type of

use, nor does the owner of property dedicated to a
particular use have a vested right to switch to a different use. However poorly
articulated and

defended these assumptions may be, they have become
established points of reference in zoning law.

#### Harbison v. City of Buffalo

```



Court of Appeals of New York, 1958.



152 N.E. 2 d 42.



```

■
FROESSEL, JUDGE. Petitioner Andrew Harbison, Sr., purchased certain real
property located at 35 Cumberland Avenue in the city of Buffalo on

January 5, 1924. Shortly thereafter he erected a 30-by
40-foot frame building thereon, and commenced operating a cooperage business,
which,

with his son, he has continued to date. The building has not
been enlarged, and the volume of petitioners’ business is stated to be the same
now

as then. The only difference is that, whereas petitioners
formerly dealt mainly with wooden barrels, they now recondition, clean and
paint “used”

steel drums or barrels. No issue of that difference is made
here. These drums, or barrels, are stacked to a height of about 10 feet in the
yard, and

on an average day about 600 or 700 barrels are stored there.

When petitioner Andrew Harbison, Sr., established his
business in 1924, the street upon which it was located was an unpaved extension
of

an existing street, the city operated a dump in the area,
and there was a glue factory in the vicinity. At the present time, the glue
factory has gone,

and there are residences adjoining both sides of
petitioners’ property and across the street. The change in the surrounding area
is reflected by the

fact that in 1924 the land was unzoned, but since 1926
(except for the period between 1949 and 1953, when it was zoned for business),
the land

has been zoned for residential use; and it is presently in
an “R3” dwelling district.

Thus it is clear that at the time of the enactment of the
first zoning ordinance affecting the premises, petitioners had an existing

nonconforming use, that is, the conduct of a cooperage
business in a residential zone. In 19 36, under an ordinance which included the
operations

of petitioners in a definition of “junk dealers”,
petitioners applied for and received a license to carry on their business.
Licenses were obtained by

petitioners every year from 1936 through the fiscal year of
1956.

However, the ordinances of the City of Buffalo were amended,
effective as of July 30 , 1953, so as to state in chapter LXX (§ 18):

“1. Continuing existing uses: Except as provided in this
section, any non-conforming use of any building, structure, land or premises
may be

continued. Provided, however, that on premises situate in
any ‘R’ district each use which is not a conforming use in the ‘R5’ district
and which

falls into one of the categories hereinafter enumerated
shall cease or shall be changed to a conforming use within 3 years from the
effective date

of this amended chapter. The requirements of this
subdivision for the termination of non-conforming uses shall apply in each of
the following

cases: * * * (d) Any junk yard’ ” (Defined in § 23, subd.
24.).

On November 27, 1956 the director of licenses of the City of
Buffalo sent a letter to petitioners stating: “At a meeting of the Common

Council

#1080

under date of November 13, 1956 * * * [it] evinced its
intention not to amend to modify the provisions of Chapter 18, Subdivision I of
Chapter

LXX of the Ordinances relation to non-conforming uses by
junk yards * * * in ‘R’ districts. * * * you are hereby notified to discontinue
the

operation of your junk yard * * * at once”. A subsequent
application by petitioners for a wholesale junk license and one for a “drum

reconditioning license” were refused on the ground that
“said premises lie within an area zoned as ‘R3’ Dwelling District * * * and the
operation

of a junk yard and the outside storage of used materials is
prohibited therein.” Petitioners then brought this article 78 proceeding in the
nature of

mandamus in which they sought an order directing the city to
issue a wholesale junk license to them, and the lower courts sustained them.

On this appeal, the City of Buffalo argues * * * that the
ordinance, held invalid by the courts below, is a valid exercise of the police
power.

---

In the major point involved on this appeal, the city argues
that the ordinance requiring the termination of petitioners’ nonconforming use
of

the premises as a junk yard within three years of the date
of said ordinance is a valid exercise of its police power. Its claim is not
based on the

theory of nuisance, and indeed this record contains little
evidence as to the manner of operation of petitioners’ business and the nature
of the

surrounding neighborhood. Rather, in this case, the city
bases its claim largely on out-of-State decisions which have sustained
ordinances

requiring the termination of nonconforming uses or
structures after a period of permitted continuance, where such “amortization”
period was

held reasonable.

When zoning ordinances are initially adopted to limit
permissible uses of property, or when property is rezoned so as to prevent uses
of

property previously allowed, a degree of protection is
constitutionally required to be given owners of property then using their
premises in a

manner forbidden by the ordinance. Thus we have held that,
where substantial expenditures were made in the commencement of the erection of
a

building, a zoning ordinance may not deprive the owner of
the “vested right” to complete the structure (People ex rel. Ortenberg v.
Bales, 166

N.E. 339 (N.Y. 1929); see City of Buffalo v. Chadeayne, 31
N.E. 443, 443–44 (N.Y. (1892)). So, where the owner already has structures on
the

premises, he cannot be directed to cease using them, just as
he has the right to continue a prior business carried on there.

However, where the benefit to the public has been deemed of
greater moment than the detriment to the property owner, we have sustained

the prohibition of continuation of prior nonconforming uses.
These cases involved the prior use of property for parking lots. We have also
upheld

the restriction of projected uses of the property where, at
the time of passage of the ordinance, there had been no substantial investment
in the

nonconforming use. In these cases, there is no doubt that
the property owners incurred a loss in the value of their property and
otherwise as a

#1081

result of the fact that they were unable to carry out their
prospective uses; but we held that such a deprivation was not violative of the
owners’

constitutional rights. In People v. Miller , 106 N.E.2d 34,
35 (N.Y. 1952), we explained these cases by stating that they involved
situations in

which the property owners would sustain only a “relatively
slight and insubstantial” loss.

It should be noted that even where the zoning authorities
may not prohibit a prior nonconforming use, they may adopt regulations which

restrict the right of the property owner to enlarge or
extend the use or to rebuild or make alterations to the structures on the
property.

As these cases indicate, our approach to the problem of
permissible restrictions on nonconforming uses has recognized that, while the

benefit accruing to the public in terms of more complete and
effective zoning does not justify the immediate destruction of substantial
businesses

or structures developed or built prior to the ordinance
(People v. Miller, 106 N.E.2d at 35), the policy of zoning embraces the concept
of the

ultimate elimination of nonconforming uses, and thus the
courts favor reasonable restriction of them. But, where the zoning ordinance
could have

required the cessation of a sand and gravel business on one
year’s notice, we have held it unconstitutional (Town of Somers v. Camarco, 127

N.E.2d 327 (N.Y. 1955)).

The development of the policy that nonconforming uses should
be protected and their existence preserved at the stage of development

existing at the time of passage of the ordinance seems to
have been based upon the assumption that the ultimate ends of zoning would be

accomplished as the nonconforming use terminated with time.
But this has not proven to be the case, as commentators have noted that the

tendency of many of these uses is to flourish capitalizing
on the fact that no new use of that nature could be begun in the area. Because
of this

situation, communities have sought new forms of ordinances
restricting nonconforming uses, and in particular have turned to provisions
which

require termination after a given period of time.

With the exception of a decision of the Ohio Supreme Court
(which may be explained on the basis of the particular language and

application of the ordinance) * * * the decisions have
sustained ordinances where the time provided was held reasonable[.] * * *

A number of States and municipal bodies have adopted
statutes authorizing this approach to the problem (as e. g., Ill.Ann.Stat.,
S.H.A., ch.

24, § 73–1; 3 Va.Code (1950), § 15–843); and the textwriters
generally express the opinion that they would be constitutional if reasonable
(1

Antieau on Municipal Corporation Law, § 7.03(3); Bassett on
Zoning, pp. 1 15–116; 8 McQuillin on Municipal Corporations (3d ed.), §
25.190).

Bassett, in his text on Zoning, states (p. 1 15) that
“Several ordinances in Long Island provide (for) * * * the ousting of
automobile junk yards

with accessory buildings * * * the owner being given from
three to six years to amortize.”

#1082

Leaving aside eminent domain and nuisance, we have often
stated in our decisions that the owner of land devoted to a prior nonconforming

use, or on which a prior nonconforming structure exists (or
has been substantially commenced), has the right to continue such use, but we
have

never held that this right may continue virtually in
perpetuity. Now that we are for the first time squarely faced with the problem
as to whether or

not this right may be terminated after a reasonable period,
during which the owner may have a fair opportunity to amortize his investment
and to

make future plans, we conclude that it may be, in accordance
with the overwhelming weight of authority found in the courts of our sister
States,

as well as with the textwriters and commentators who have
expressed themselves upon the subject.

With regard to prior nonconforming structures , reasonable
termination periods based upon the amortized life of the structure are not, in
our

opinion, unconstitutional. They do not compel the immediate
destruction of the improvements, but envision and allow for their normal life

without extensive alterations or repairs. Such a regulation
is akin to those we have sustained relating to restrictions upon the extension
or

substantial repair or replacement of prior nonconforming
structures.

As to prior nonconforming uses , the closest case we have
had is Town of Somers v. Camarco, 127 N.E.2d 327, supra. In that case we held

that, in view of defendant’s investment and the business
which had been built up and carried on over the years, the provisions of the
ordinance

which required defendant to apply for a permit to continue
its business every year, and provided further that on the termination of any
approval

period any structure or improvement on the premises could be
ordered removed and the premises restored to their original condition as nearly
as

practicable, were unreasonable. There the land involved had
unusual resources which made it especially suitable for the nonconforming use

carried on; the improvements were necessary for the
operation of the business, and the period of termination was unreasonably
short. Under these

circumstances the ordinance would have deprived the property
owner of his “vested rights”. As was pointed out in the opinion (127 N.E.2d at

328), “The courts, in order to afford stability to property
owners who do have existing nonconforming uses, have imposed the test of

reasonableness upon such exercise of the police powers.
Therefore broad general rules and tests, such as expressed in People v. Miller,
304 N.Y.

105, 106 N.E.2d 34, must always be considered in this
context.”

If, therefore, a zoning ordinance provides a sufficient
period of permitted nonconformity, it may further provide that at the end of
such

period the use must cease. This rule is analogous to that
with respect to nonconforming structures. In ascertaining the reasonable period
during

which an owner of property must be allowed to continue a
nonconforming use, a balance must be found between social harm and private
injury.

We cannot say that a legislative body may not in any case,
after consideration of the factors involved, conclude that the termination of a
use after

a

#1083

period of time sufficient to allow a property owner an
opportunity to amortize his investment and make other plans is a valid method
of solving

the problem.

To enunciate a contrary rule would mean that the use of land
for such purposes as a tennis court, an open air skating rink, a junk yard or a

parking lot—readily transferable to another site—at the date
of the enactment of a zoning ordinance vests the owner thereof with the right
to

utilize the land in that manner in perpetuity, regardless of
the changes in the neighborhood over the course of time. In the light of our
ever

expanding urban communities, such a rule appears to us to
constitute an unwarranted restriction upon the Legislature in dealing with what
has

been described as “One of the major problems in effective
administration of modern zoning ordinances” (1951 Wis.L.Rev. 685). When the

termination provisions are reasonable in the light of the
nature of the business of the property owner, the improvements erected on the
land, the

character of the neighborhood, and the detriment caused the
property owner, we may not hold them constitutionally invalid.

In the present case, the two lower courts have expressed the
view that, “Whatever the law may be in California or Florida or other

jurisdictions, in this State” no regulation infringing at
any time the perpetual right of an owner to continue a prior nonconforming use
is valid.

Accordingly, neither court considered the question of
whether the particular period prescribed by the ordinance was reasonable under
the facts of

this case.

Their conclusion is not in accord with the general rule
applicable to protection of nonconforming uses as stated in People v. Miller ,
106

N.E.2d 34, 35, supra. In that case we decided that where the
enforcement of an ordinance requiring the termination of a prior nonconforming
use

caused “relatively slight and insubstantial” loss to the
property owner, it would be constitutional. While it is true that the ordinance
there

involved did not have an “amortization” provision,
nevertheless the general test enunciated is no less germane when such a
provision is included

in the ordinance. As previously pointed out, the period of
“amortization” allowed by the ordinance is a crucial factor in determining
whether the

ordinance has been constitutionally applied in a given case.

Here, petitioners are engaged in the business of
reconditioning barrels or used steel drums. We are told that the value of the
property

together with the improvements is $20,000; but there is no
indication of the relative value of the land and improvements separately. It
was further

alleged that the improvement consists of a 30- by 40-foot
frame building erected in 1924, and, in addition thereto, petitioners claim
that at the

insistence of the City of Buffalo, three years before the
ordinance went into effect, they were obliged to install a special sewage
system at a cost

of $2,000 and a boiler at a cost of $700.

Material triable issues of fact thus remain, and a further
hearing should adduce evidence relating to the nature of the surrounding

#1084

neighborhood, the value and condition of the improvements on
the premises, the nearest area to which petitioners might relocate, the cost of
such

relocation, as well as any other reasonable costs which bear
upon the kind and amount of damages which petitioners might sustain, and
whether

petitioners might be able to continue operation of their
business if not allowed to continue storage of barrels or steel drums outside
their frame

building. It is only upon such evidence that it may be
ascertained whether the resultant injury to petitioners would be so substantial
that the

ordinance would be unconstitutional as applied to the
particular facts of this case.

The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed,
without costs, and the matter remanded to Special Term for a trial of the
material

issues and further proceedings as outlined in this opinion.

■ VAN
VOORHIS, JUDGE (dissenting). The decision which is about to be rendered marks,
in my view, the beginning of the end of the constitutional

protection of property rights in this State in pre-existing
nonconforming uses under zoning ordinances. Special Term and the Appellate
Division

unanimously followed the existing law in holding this
amendment to the zoning ordinance of the City of Buffalo to be
unconstitutional. In my

view the traditional rule is right, and should not be
abrogated. * * *

The phraseology of this 1953 zoning amendment is important.
It reads as follows:

“§ 18. Non-conforming uses and buildings. 1. Continuing
existing uses: Except as provided in this section, any non-conforming use of
any

building, structure, land or premises may be continued.
Provided, however, that on premises situate in any ‘R’ district each use which
is not a

conforming use in the ‘R5’ district and which falls into one
of the categories hereinafter enumerated shall cease or shall be changed to a

conforming use within 3 years from the effective date of
this amended chapter. The requirements of this subdivision for the termination
of non-

conforming uses shall apply in each of the following cases:

“(a) Any such non-conforming use involving the use of land
only and not accessory to an adjacent building or structure assessed as a real

estate improvement.

“(b) Any such non-conforming use involving the use of or
accessory to one or more buildings or structures on the same lot, the aggregate

assessed value of which improvements for tax purposes is not
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00).

“(c) Any such non-conforming use consisting of a sign.

“(d) Any junk yard, auto wrecking or dismantling
establishment.” * * *

The plaintiffs’ business [is] being confiscated, as has been
mentioned, not on the basis that the improvements are assessed within

#1085

$500, but regardless of how much the improvements may be
worth. It is being terminated under the language of this ordinance for the sole
reason

that it is classified as a junk yard. I agree with what was
said by the Appellate Division (169 N.Y.S.2d 599) that “Whatever the law may be
in

California or Florida or other jurisdictions, in this state,
the rule is as stated in People v. Miller, 304 N.Y. 105, 107, 109, 106 N.E.2d
34, 35, to

wit: ‘It is the law of this state that non-conforming uses
or structures, in existence when a zoning ordinance is enacted, are, as a
general rule,

constitutionally protected and will be permitted to
continue, notwithstanding the contrary provision of the ordinance.’ ” Not less
than nine cases

are cited in our opinion in People v. Miller, 106 N.E.2d 34
(N.Y. 1952), as authority for this statement ( 106 N.E.2d at 34). Plaintiffs’
business is

not a nuisance. It is not injurious to life or health or
morals. The neighbors whose sensibilities are offended would have found
difficulty in

abating it (even if it were a nuisance) for the reason that
they “came to the nuisance,” in the time honored phrase, by purchasing and
moving into

the neighborhood while petitioners’ business was in
operation. Neither, in my mind, can the city abolish this business under this
ordinance. Even

if this case came under the clause abrogating nonconforming
uses where the buildings or structures on the lot do not exceed $500 in
assessed

value, the ordinance would still be unconstitutional. Zoning
relates to the future development of municipalities. Areas in cities that have
already

been developed cannot be zoned retroactively. That is the
function of municipal redevelopment, which is constitutionally authorized by
statutes

directing payment of just compensation for property that is
appropriated. It is arbitrary, in my view, to draw the line at buildings or
structures

valued at $500 or less. That sum is negligible in the case
of large stores or factories, whereas it may represent the savings of years to
small

proprietors. If the line can be drawn at $500, it will soon
be extended to $5,000 or perhaps to $50,000. If, in principle, the city is
allowed to

confiscate property without payment of just compensation, it
is no answer to say that it is taking only $500. It would be a novel
proposition that a

municipality can take private property for a public use
without compensation provided that it does not take too much. Retroactive
zoning, as this

clearly is, resembles slum clearance more than zoning, which
is for the future. If $500 is so small an amount, then why should not the city
be

obliged to pay it before confiscating this use, by the same
token whereby it would be required to pay just compensation in cases of slum

clearance? That there is no existing statutory authority to
make such a payment in this case is not justification for confiscating the
prior use

which is a vested right. It would be no answer to argue that
the small businessman does not need to be compensated provided that he is small

enough. No such rule as that can be applied in zoning
administration. If any distinction of that kind were relevant, it would be more
appropriate

to be guided by what proportion of the businessman’s assets
have been invested in improvements to his property. Observing the vagaries of

modern zoning, many a businessman

#1086

(large or small) might properly hesitate to invest his life
savings in a store or other commercial or industrial property knowing that his
investment

is liable to be expropriated after the enterprise has been
successfully launched, if some pressure group succeeds in obtaining favorable
action

from a municipal legislature. That is not in the public
interest. Constitutional security against such developments is infinitely more
important to

the public at large than the occasional presence of a
nonconforming use, or the possibility that a nonconforming use may acquire some
advantage

by way of monopoly in the use district. * * *

In this instance, as has been said, the limitation to $500
assessed valuation in this zoning ordinance does not apply. Petitioners come
under a

different subdivision which outlaws after three years “Any
junk yard, auto wrecking or dismantling establishment.” * * *

The circumstance that this is a cooperage establishment or
junk yard ought not to obscure that the principle of the decision applies to
any

kind of business which, due to lapse of time, has been
overtaken by changes in the neighborhood. The principle of the decision applies
equally to

stores, shops or service organizations which are
retroactively legislated out of existence by the abolition of prior
nonconforming uses. If

petitioners’ establishment is not secure against this kind
of invasion, no one else’s business is better protected. The neighbors or the
officials of a

municipality in one year may look askance at a junk or
cooperage yard, and in another year may frown upon the conduct in a particular
locality

of any other type of commerce or industry. The people who
moved into petitioners’ vicinity and now find their business offensive may not
be

aware that the principle of this decision unsettles their
own property rights, and that it may suddenly be used against them in
unexpected ways if

agitation arises to legislate them out of business by a
similar procedure. It makes little difference what the nature of their
businesses may be. The

smaller they are the more vulnerable they become to this
kind of attack, which is based on the misfortune of unpopularity. Democracy
depends

upon respect for the individual as well as upon majority
rule. The relaxation of constitutional safeguards protecting commonly accepted
personal

and property rights, goes hand in hand with the
multiplication of pressure groups. People should not be obliged to organize to
preserve rights the

safeguarding of which is the proper function of law. The
small manufacturer or merchant feels this acutely, since he ordinarily finds it
more

difficult to succeed in wielding organized power for his own
protection when property rights depend upon the discretion of legislative
bodies. No

question is raised here concerning the good faith of the
enactment or administration of this ordinance. Nevertheless petitioners find
themselves

confronted by the organized civil power of the municipality,
set in motion by the complaints of their neighbors who wish to eliminate them
from

the locality in which petitioners settled first. If this
part of the city is to be redeveloped, it should be done through the enactment
of a statute

similar in principle to

#1087

slum clearance acts, whereby just compensation can be paid
for private property that is confiscated for a public use. Petitioners have
well-

recognized legal property rights which ought to be protected
in court.

Zoning, as originally conceived, related to the future
development of municipalities. It was not an attempt to reconstruct the past.
Cases

such as Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365
(1926), and Lincoln Trust Co. v. Williams Bldg. Corp., 128 N.E. 209 (N.Y.
1920),

were decided in this frame of reference. Pre-existing
nonconforming uses were uniformly excepted from the operation of zoning
ordinances, and

the proprietors thereof were held to have the constitutional
right to continue such uses. We are now told that the protection of
nonconforming

uses in the beginning was a [stratagem] of city planners,
“prompted by a fear that the courts would hold unconstitutional any zoning
ordinance

which attempted to eliminate existing nonconforming uses.”
(1951 Wis.L.Rev. 685; 35 Va.L.R. 352, citing Bassett on Zoning, p. 108, n. 1;
also

Noel, Retroactive Zoning and Nuisances, 41 Col.L.Rev. 457,
473.) The Virginia Law Review note, citing these authorities, states: “Those
who

led the zoning movement in its early stages adopted a
lenient attitude towards nonconforming buildings. They did so because they did
not wish to

arouse the animosity of a large segment of property owners
at a time when opposition might have jeopardized the whole success of zoning.”
The

reasoning of these and other commentators, and of some
decisions in other States, is that all zoning interferes with property rights
to some

degree, even in case of unused vacant land, and that now
another step should be taken by eliminating pre-existing uses which were
formerly held

to constitute vested property rights * * *

In practice this spells confusion, instability, inability to
diagnose what are legal rights, inconsistency, arbitrariness and discrimination
in

administrative and court decisions, and an avalanche of
litigation. That Pandora’s box is opened, regardless of the best possible
intentions on the

part of all concerned. Nor is the judgment appealed from an
unwarranted interference by the courts in the province of the municipal
legislature. It

simply follows precedent from the beginning of zoning
practice. The new rule has the additional infirmity that it opens wide new
fields of

discretion in administrative law without any workable
standards by which it is to be guided.

The lack of any principle in applying the novel theory of
“amortization” betrays a fundamental weakness in the theory. Zoning, like other

public programs, is not always best administered at the
hands of its enthusiasts. The existence of non-conforming uses has spoiled the
symmetry

in the minds of zoning experts. It has bulked so large in
this context that, desirable as the elimination of nonconforming uses may be,
it has

sometimes been presented as though it were more important
than ordinary property rights. “Many means of eliminating and controlling

nonconforming uses have been proposed and tried. Among these
means are retroactive zoning, amortization of nonconforming uses, abatement

#1088

of nonconforming uses as nuisances, public purchase and
eminent domain, prohibition of the resumption of a non-conforming use after a
period

of discontinuance, and refusal to provide governmental
services to nonconforming users” (1951 Wis.L.Rev. 687). This Wisconsin Law
Review

article points out how most of these different proposals
have been tried and found wanting, particularly the method by exercising the
power of

eminent domain which is said to have been discarded mainly
for the reason that it is too expensive. The same is said at page 93 of Volume
102 of

the Pennsylvania Law Review. The fault found with eminent
domain is that it failed to achieve the object of destroying the owner’s right
in his

property without paying for it. Consequently the most
promising legal theory at the moment is known as “amortization”. * * *

This theory to justify extinguishing nonconforming uses
means less the more one thinks about it. It offers little more promise of
ultimate

success than the other theories which have been tried and
abandoned. In the first place, the periods of time vary so widely in the cases
which

have been cited from different States where it has been
tried, and have so little relation to the useful lives of the structures, that
this theory cannot

be used to reconcile these discordant decisions. Moreover
the term “amortization”, as thus employed, had not the same meaning which it
carries

in law or accounting. It is not even used by analogy. It is
just a catch phrase, and the reasoning is reduced to argument by metaphor. Not
only has

no effort been made in the reported cases where this theory
has been applied to determine what is the useful life of the structure, but
almost all

were decided under ordinances or statutes which prescribe
the same time limit for many different kinds of improvements. This demonstrates
that

it is not attempted to measure the life of the particular
building or type of building, and that the word “amortization” is used as an
empty

shibboleth. This comment applies to the ordinance at issue
on this appeal. There could be no presumption that all junk yards, all auto
wrecking or

dismantling establishments, and all improvements assessed
for tax purposes at not more than $500 will or have any tendency to depreciate
to

zero in three years. This shows that the ordinance in suit
could not possibly have been based on the amortization theory.

Moreover this theory, if it were seriously advanced, would
imply that the owner should not keep up his property by making necessary

replacements to restore against the ravages of time. Such
replacements would be money thrown away. The amortization theory would thus

encourage owners of nonconforming uses to allow them to
decay and become slums.

Although the courts of other States are divided on this
question, the better reason seems to me to be on the side of the rule
heretofore

established in this State, wherefore I vote to affirm. * * *

Order reversed, etc.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The problem of nonconforming uses is more of an issue in
older cities. The accommodation here is narrow; usually a zoning ordinance
forbids a

change of one nonconforming use to another. Some schemes
allow a change to a “higher” nonconforming use. Originally it was thought that

nonconforming uses would disappear fairly quickly as
buildings aged and fell into disrepair. This did not always happen. One
possible reason is that

having the only use of a kind in an area is often valuable.
Being the only bar in a residential neighborhood is advantageous to the bar
owner. Eminent

domain (taking the right to the specific use or taking
ownership of the parcel) is a potential solution, but as noted in the dissent
in _Harbison_ ,

compensation must be paid. “Amortization” or phasing out the
use is another solution that does not involve compensation. Some states do not
allow it,

see, e.g., PA Northwestern Distributors, Inc. v. Zoning
Hearing Board, 584 A. 2 d 1372 (Pa. 1991 ), and others do, using a multi-factor
test as in the

principal case.

2 .What is the difference between a use already undertaken
and one only planned, or even merely potential? In terms of efficiency?
Fairness? If, as

Harold Demsetz argues (see Chapter III), the owner acts as a
broker between the future and the present, should there be any difference
between a use the

owner has in mind and one she has invested in developing
already? Or does an aversion to depriving an owner of an actual use reflect the
psychology of

ownership? Should it? Should uses that reflect personhood
property in Margaret Jane Radin’s sense (see Chapter III) get more protection
than other

uses? For an argument that the distinction between existing
and future uses is not justified, see Christopher Serkin, Existing Uses and the
Limits of Land

Use Regulation, 84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1222 ( 2009 ).

3 .Amortization may be prohibited or constrained by state
constitutions or statutes, especially zoning enabling acts. Uncertainty
sometimes lingers

about whether amortization may be found to be a taking. Many
of the themes here—nuisance, investment-backed uses, compensation,
“blight”—will

make a reappearance in Chapter X, on government forbearance
and takings. Both vested rights and takings reflect a tension between stability
in property

rights and flexibility in government responses to new
problems.

Zoning Policy

Despite its prevalence, zoning has always been very
controversial. The case for zoning rests on its potential to deal with land-use

externalities. For those who see rampant market failure and
collective-action problems, private solutions such as covenants cannot be the
entire

solution. The case for the inadequacy of covenants is
greatest in older neighborhoods that lack covenants that would be desired now.
The

transaction costs of setting up covenants to govern
micro-decisions like door color would be enormous and holdout problems loom
large. (By

contrast, in a new development, as we have seen, developers
can insert whatever package of covenants that they think will maximize
profits.)

Furthermore, proponents of zoning view judicial efforts to
control

#1090

incompatible land uses through nuisance law as inadequate as
well. Particularly where land-use controls involve specific targets—such as
set-

backs or lot coverage—or commercial uses like gas stations
that may not rise to the level of a common-law nuisance, judges are
ill-equipped to

supply detailed governance regimes to prescribe proper use.
This problem becomes more acute when zoning and land-use planning are regarded

as involving choices on an area-wide or city-wide basis.
Suburban growth controls can even involve regional planning.

Zoning also can play a role in the competition of localities
for residents. If localities can offer different packages of taxes and public
goods,

residents can sort themselves into the places that most suit
them. This sort of positive interjurisdictional competition is sometimes termed
the

Tiebout Hypothesis (“Tiebout” is pronounced “Tee-BOWE”).
Charles M. Tiebout, A Pure Theory of Local Expenditures, 64 J. Pol. Econ. 416

(1956). Essential to this type of competition is that those
who do not pay can be excluded from the benefits. Bruce W. Hamilton, Zoning and

Property Taxation in a System of Local Governments, 12 Urb.
Stud. 205 (1975). That is, only people paying taxes will enjoy the schools,
parks,

etc. that those taxes fund. For those who support this type
of interjurisdictional competition, zoning is viewed as a tool to prevent
“fiscal

freeriding,” by allowing municipalities to select the types
of land uses they wish to attract or avoid. Moreover, the benefits and costs
from the

flow of municipal services and taxes in such a model seem to
be capitalized into the price of houses, which would lead one to expect

homeowners to support value-maximizing packages of public
goods. Homeowners can be expected to care deeply about these values, because a

home is most people’s single largest investment. And because
it is very difficult to diversify this investment (or to insure against drops
in market

value), one should expect to find risk-averse behavior among
homeowners (with NIMBY-ism—the not-in-my-backyard phenomenon—being its

most extreme form). William A. Fischel, The Homevoter
Hypothesis: How Home Values Influence Local Government Taxation, School
Finance,

and Land-Use Policies (2001).

The case against zoning emphasizes the flip-side of the
benefits of zoning. The notion of comprehensive planning itself has its
skeptics.

They point to the sorry record of planning and urban renewal
in the mid-to-late twentieth century, which emphasized largeness and

rationalization and extreme separation of uses, leaving even
the pro-planning side advocating new approaches emphasizing a greater mix of
uses

and consequently more vibrant street life. Zoning is subject
to the limits of bureaucratic decisionmaking, including rigidity, high
administrative

costs, and blunt incentives, resulting in uniformity and
lack of attention to widely dispersed knowledge. See Jane Jacobs, The Life and
Death of

Great American Cities (1961). Developers and homeowners may
use the zoning process to engage in rent-seeking, restricting the supply of

housing and creating local monopolies.

#1091

Requirements of large lots cause urban sprawl, raise housing
costs, and promote class and racial segregation. Basically, tools to exclude
those

who cannot afford prescribed types of housing can be used to
prevent both fiscal freeriding and to keep out those undesired by current
owners.

Most U.S. cities have zoning, and the only major city not to
have zoning is Houston. This case has been much studied and opponents of

zoning point to it as a relatively successful example of
land use without zoning. Bernard H. Siegan, Land Use Without Zoning (1972). It
should

be remembered, though, that Houston is not devoid of
land-use regulations. In addition to widespread use of covenants, Houston also
has

subdivision controls, which regulate matters like lot size.
Nevertheless, Houston has a greater proximity of residential and commercial
uses than

other cities of its size. In an econometric study on
Houston, Janet Spreyer finds that after controlling for a number of factors,
zoning and

covenants are equally and independently effective at raising
home prices over a hypothetical nuisance-only regime. Janet Furman Spreyer, The

Effect of Land Use Restrictions on the Market Value of
Single Family Homes in Houston, 2 J. Real Estate Fin. & Econ. 117 (1989).
Another

jurisdiction that has attracted a lot of attention is New
Haven. Compare Andrew J. Cappel, A Walk Along Willow: Patterns of Land Use

Coordination in Pre-Zoning New Haven (1870–1926), 101 Yale
L.J. 617 (1991) (finding large degree of land-use coordination in one
pre-zoning

New Haven neighborhood) with Stephen Clowney, A Walk Along
Willard: A Revised Look at Land Use Coordination in Pre-Zoning New

Haven, 115 Yale L.J. 116 (2005) (finding more mixed success
and failure in four pre-zoning neighborhoods in New Haven).

Recently zoning has attracted additional interest of
economists using advanced statistical techniques. One problem in drawing
conclusions

from studies of zoning based on housing prices is that
zoning may increase prices (i) because it prevents negative externalities and
thereby makes

housing more valuable to its current and future owners or
(ii) because it causes local monopolies in the market for housing and therefore

decreases welfare. Or both. Even the original interest in
zoning on the part of developers of high-grade housing in the early twentieth
century is

consistent with either the optimistic or the pessimistic
story (or, again, both). Edward Glaeser and Joseph Gyourko manage to tease
these effects

apart by comparing housing prices and minimum profitable
production costs in localities across the United States. They find that the
cost of

housing in some places is quite close to the minimum
profitable production cost, but in a growing number of jurisdictions especially
in California

and some Eastern cities, where housing prices are
significantly higher than cost. This suggests that zoning and other land-use
controls are the

major reason for the high cost of housing in those areas and
that this regulatory tax probably exceeds the externalities from new
construction.

The implications for the economy and society are potentially
quite substantial. Edward L. Glaeser & Joseph Gyourko, The

#1092

Economic Implications of Housing Supply, 32 J. Econ. Persp.
3 (Winter 2018). In a similar paper, these authors and Raven Saks isolate the

contribution of increasingly difficult regulatory approval
for new building to the increase in housing costs between 1950 and 1970. Edward
L.

Glaeser, Joseph E. Gyourko, & Raven E. Saks, Why Have
Housing Prices Gone Up?, 95 Am. Econ. Rev. 329 (2005) (Pap. & Proc.).
Artificially

pumped up housing prices have likely prevented labor
migration and stalled income convergence between regions in the U.S. Peter
Ganong &

Daniel Shoag, Why Has Regional Income Convergence in the
U.S. Declined?, 102 J. Urban Econ. 76 (2017).

In part as a result of these studies, several cities and
states have begun trying to reduce or eliminate the single-family use districts
perceived

as contributing to housing unaffordability. Minneapolis, for
instance, passed legislation in 2019 allowing duplexes and triplexes in any
single-

family area. See Emily Badger & Quoctrung Bui, Cities
Start to Question an American Ideal: A House with a Yard on Every Lot, N.Y.
Times

(June 18, 2019), https://nyti.ms/ 37QtS8Z. The debate over
ending single-family zoning sometimes involves broader questions about local
versus

state power. In late 2021, California passed a law
authorizing duplexes in single-family districts that preempts more restrictive
local zoning

ordinances. See also John Infranca, The New State Zoning:
Land Use Preemption Amid a Housing Crisis, 60 B.C. L. Rev. 823 (2019). Some

critics have worried that broad preemptive legislation in
this context may legitimize other forms of preemption that target innovative
city

policymaking. Richard C. Schragger, The Perils of Land Use
Deregulation, 170 U. Pa. L. Rev. 125 (2022). Others have defended zoning for
its

role in constraining the pace of change, noting the
possibility that deed restrictions will replace zoning with more pernicious
consequences. See

Christopher Serkin, A Case for Zoning, 96 Notre Dame L. Rev.
749 (2020). These arguments have met with substantial opposition on the

grounds that they only serve to empower NIMBYs. See, e.g.,
David Schleicher, Constitutional Law for NIMBYs: A Review of ‘Principles of

Home Rule for the 21st Century’ by the National League of
Cities, 81 Ohio St. L.J. 883 (2020); David Schleicher, Exclusionary Zoning’s

Confused Defenders, 2021 Wis. L. Rev. 1315. Nevertheless,
despite some successes for those seeking to liberalize zoning, there remains

opposition, including some from organizers concerned that
deregulation is a poor substitute for increased public housing subsidies and
that it will

contribute to gentrification. See Jenna Davis, The
Double-Edged Sword of Upzoning, Brookings, July 15, 2021,

On a worldwide scale, land-use regulation has had a major
impact on the shape of cities, with profound economic consequences. The

strength of the regulatory regime tends to flatten and
sometimes invert the usual sharply downward-sloping (negative exponential)
population

gradient. Alain Bertaud & Stephen Malpezzi, The Spatial
Distribution of

#1093

Population in 48 World Cities: Implications for Economies in
Transition (working paper Dec. 17, 2003); Alain Bertaud & Bertrand Renaud,

Socialist Cities without Land Markets, 41 J. Urban Econ. 137
(1997). These authors present a model and empirical results, but we will
consider

some illustrative examples drawn from their papers. What the
authors call “market cities” like Paris have the usual pattern (or one variant
of it)

with a low population density downtown, then rising steeply
and then dropping density as one goes further out. In highly regulatory regimes

housing supply is government-driven, leading sometimes to
inverted density gradients; these cities include those shaped by socialism,
like

Moscow (see below) and cities with heavy planning like
Brasilia.

High density far from the center makes development of
transportation more difficult and commuting times greater, and can lead to
eventual

abandonment of such housing. In general, these patterns have
major implications for economic development and for economies making the

transition from socialism to capitalism, in particular.

Exclusionary Zoning

We now take a closer look at one aspect of the zoning
controversy—exclusionary zoning. As noted above, some accuse zoning of

promoting class and race segregation, while local officials
will claim that the devices in question are designed to maintain a robust tax
base.

Consider the following case.

#1094

#### Southern Burlington County N.A.A.C.P. v. Township of

Mount Laurel

```



Supreme Court of New Jersey, 1975.



336 A. 2 d 713.



```

■ HALL,
J. This case attacks the system of land use regulation by defendant Township of
Mount Laurel on the ground that low and moderate

income families are thereby unlawfully excluded from the
municipality. The trial court so found, 290 A.2d 465 (N.J. Super. Law Div.
1972), and

declared the township zoning ordinance totally invalid. * *
*

Plaintiffs represent the minority group poor (black and
Hispanic)^3 seeking such quarters. But they are not the only category of
persons

barred from so many municipalities by reason of restrictive
land use regulations. We have reference to young and elderly couples, single
persons

and large, growing families not in the poverty class, but
who still cannot afford the only kinds of housing realistically permitted in
most places—

relatively high-priced, single-family detached dwellings on
sizeable lots and, in some municipalities, expensive apartments. We will,
therefore,

consider the case from the wider viewpoint that the effect
of Mount Laurel’s land use regulation has been to prevent various categories of
persons

from living in the township because of the limited extent of
their income and resources. In this connection, we accept the representation of
the

municipality’s counsel at oral argument that the regulatory
scheme was not adopted with any desire or intent to exclude prospective
residents on

the obviously illegal bases of race, origin or believed
social incompatibility. * * *

* * * [The township’s] candid position is that, conceding
      its land use regulation was intended to result and has resulted in economic

discrimination and exclusion of substantial segments of the
area population, its policies and practices are in the best present and future
fiscal

interest of the municipality and its inhabitants and are
legally permissible and justified. * * *

I

The Facts

Mount Laurel is a flat, sprawling township, 22 square miles,
or about 14,000 acres, in area, on the west central edge of Burlington County.
It

is roughly triangular in shape, with its base, approximately
eight miles long, extending in a northeasterly-southwesterly direction roughly
parallel

with and a few miles east of the Delaware River. Part of its
southerly side abuts Cherry Hill in Camden County. That section of the

#1095

township is about seven miles from the boundary line of the
city of Camden and not more than 10 miles from the Benjamin Franklin Bridge

crossing the river to Philadelphia.

In 1950, the township had a population of 2817, only about
600 more people than it had in 1940. It was then, as it had been for decades,

primarily a rural agricultural area with no sizeable
settlements or commercial or industrial enterprises. The populace generally
lived in individual

houses scattered along country roads. There were several
pockets of poverty, with deteriorating or dilapidated housing (apparently 300
or so units

of which remain today in equally poor condition). After
1950, as in so many other municipalities similarly situated, residential
development and

some commerce and industry began to come in. By 1960 the
population had almost doubled to 5249 and by 1970 had more than doubled again
to

1 1,221. These new residents were, of course, “outsiders”
from the nearby central cities and older suburbs or from more distant places
drawn here

by reason of employment in the region. The township is now
definitely a part of the outer ring of the South Jersey metropolitan area,
which area

we define as those portions of Camden, Burlington and
Gloucester Counties within a semicircle having a radius of 20 miles or so from
the heart

of Camden city. And 65% of the township is still vacant land
or in agricultural use.

The growth of the township has been spurred by the
construction or improvement of main highways through or near it. * * * This
highway

network gives the township a most strategic location from
the standpoint of transport of goods and people by truck and private car. There
is no

other means of transportation.

The location and nature of development has been, as usual,
controlled by the local zoning enactments. The general ordinance presently in

force, which was declared invalid by the trial court, was
adopted in 1964. We understand that earlier enactments provided, however,
basically the

same scheme but were less restrictive as to residential
development. The growth pattern dictated by the ordinance is typical.

Under the present ordinance, 29.2% of all the land in the
township, or 4,121 acres, is zoned for industry. * * * Only industry meeting

specified performance standards is permitted. The effect is
to limit the use substantially to light manufacturing, research, distribution
of goods,

offices and the like. Some nonindustrial uses, such as
agriculture, farm dwellings, motels, a harness racetrack, and certain retail
sales and service

establishments, are permitted in this zone. At the time of
trial no more than 100 acres, mostly in the southwesterly corner along route 73
adjacent

to the turnpike and I–295 interchanges, were actually
occupied by industrial uses. * * * [I]t appeared clear that, as happens in the
case of so many

municipalities, much more land has been so zoned than the
reasonable potential for industrial movement or expansion warrants. At

#1096

the same time, however, the land cannot be used for
residential development under the general ordinance.

The amount of land zoned for retail business use under the
general ordinance is relatively small—169 acres, or 1.2% of the total. * * *

The balance of the land area, almost 10,000 acres, has been
developed until recently in the conventional form of major subdivisions. The

general ordinance provides for four residential zones,
designated R-1, R-1D, R-2 and R-3. All permit only single-family, detached
dwellings, one

house per lot—the usual form of grid development. Attached
townhouses, apartments (except on farms for agricultural workers) and mobile

homes are not allowed anywhere in the township under the
general ordinance. This dwelling development, resulting in the previously
mentioned

quadrupling of the population, has been largely confined to
the R-1 and R-2 districts in two sections[.] * * * The result has been quite
intensive

development of these sections, but at a low density. The
dwellings are substantial[.] * * *

A variation from conventional development has recently
occurred in some parts of Mount Laurel, as in a number of other similar

municipalities, by use of the land use regulation device
known as “planned unit development” (PUD). This scheme differs from the
traditional in

that the type, density and placement of land uses and
buildings, instead of being detailed and confined to specified districts by
local legislation in

advance, is determined by contract, or “deal,” as to each
development between the developer and the municipal administrative authority,
under

broad guidelines laid down by state enabling legislation and
an implementing local ordinance. The stress is on regulation of density and

permitted mixture of uses within the same area, including
various kinds of living accommodations with or without commercial and
industrial

enterprises. The idea may be basically thought of as the
creation of “new towns” in virgin territory, full-blown or in miniature,
although most

frequently the concept has been limited in practice, as in
Mount Laurel, to residential developments of various sizes having some variety
of

housing and perhaps some retail establishments to serve the
inhabitants. * * *

These projects, three in the southwesterly sector and one in
the northeasterly sector, are very substantial and involve at least 10,000 sale
and

rental housing units of various types to be erected over a
period of years. Their bounds were created by agreement rather than legislative

specification on the zoning map, invading industrial, R-1,
R-1D, R-3 and even flood plain zones. If completed as planned, they will in

themselves ultimately quadruple the 1970 township
population, but still leave a good part of the township undeveloped. (The
record does not

indicate how far development in each of the projects has
progressed.) While multi-family housing in the form of rental garden, medium
rise and

high rise apartments and attached townhouses is for the
first time provided for, as well as single-family detached dwellings for sale,
it is not

designed to

#1097

accommodate and is beyond the financial reach of low and
moderate income families, especially those with young children. The aim is
quite the

contrary; as with the single-family homes in the older
conventional subdivisions, only persons of medium and upper income are sought
as

residents.

A few details will furnish sufficient documentation. Each of
the resolutions of tentative approval of the projects contains a similar fact

finding to the effect that the development will attract a
highly educated and trained population base to support the nearby industrial
parks in the

township as well as the business and commercial facilities.
The approvals also sharply limit the number of apartments having more than one

bedroom. Further, they require that the developer must
provide in its leases that no school-age children shall be permitted to occupy
any one-

bedroom apartment and that no more than two such children
shall reside in any two-bedroom unit. The developer is also required, prior to
the

issuance of the first building permit, to record a covenant,
running with all land on which multi-family housing is to be constructed,
providing

that in the event more than .3 school children per
multi-family unit shall attend the township school system in any one year, the
developer will

pay the cost of tuition and other school expenses of all
such excess numbers of children. In addition, low density, required amenities,
such as

central air conditioning, and specified developer
contributions help to push rents and sales prices to high levels. These
contributions include fire

apparatus, ambulances, fire houses, and very large sums of
money for educational facilities, a cultural center and the township library.

Still another restrictive land use regulation was adopted by
the township through a supplement to the general zoning ordinance enacted in

September 1972 creating a new zone, R-4, Planned Adult
Retirement Community (PARC). * * * The extensive development requirements

detailed in the ordinance make it apparent that the scheme
was not designed for, and would be beyond the means of, low and moderate income

retirees. * * *

All this affirmative action for the benefit of certain
segments of the population is in sharp contrast to the lack of action, and
indeed hostility,

with respect to affording any opportunity for decent housing
for the township’s own poor living in substandard accommodations, found largely
in

the section known as Springville (R-3 zone). * * * In 1968 a
private non-profit association sought to build subsidized, multi-family housing
in

the Springville section with funds to be granted by a higher
level governmental agency. Advance municipal approval of the project was
required.

The Township Committee responded with a purportedly
approving resolution, which found a need for “moderate” income housing in the
area,

but went on to specify that such housing must be constructed
subject to all zoning, planning, building and other applicable ordinances and
codes.

This meant single-family detached dwellings on 20,000 square
foot lots. (Fear was also expressed that such housing would attract low

#1098

income families from outside the township.) Needless to say,
such requirements killed realistic housing for this group of low and moderate

income families.

The record thoroughly substantiates the findings of the
trial court that over the years Mount Laurel “has acted affirmatively to
control

development and to attract a selective type of growth” and
that “through its zoning ordinances has exhibited economic discrimination in
that the

poor have been deprived of adequate housing and the
opportunity to secure the construction of subsidized housing, and has used
federal, state,

county and local finances and resources solely for the
betterment of middle and upper-income persons.”

There cannot be the slightest doubt that the reason for this
course of conduct has been to keep down local taxes on property (Mount Laurel

is not a high tax municipality) and that the policy was
carried out without regard for non-fiscal considerations with respect to people
, either

within or without its boundaries. * * *

This policy of land use regulation for a fiscal end derives
from New Jersey’s tax structure, which has imposed on local real estate most of

the cost of municipal and county government and of the
primary and secondary education of the municipality’s children. The latter
expense is

much the largest, so, basically, the fewer the school
children, the lower the tax rate. Sizeable industrial and commercial ratables
are eagerly

sought and homes and the lots on which they are situate are
required to be large enough, through minimum lot sizes and minimum floor areas,
to

have substantial value in order to produce greater tax
revenues to meet school costs. Large families who cannot afford to buy large
houses and

must live in cheaper rental accommodations are definitely
not wanted, so we find drastic bedroom restrictions for, or complete
prohibition of,

multi-family or other feasible housing for those of lesser
income.

This pattern of land use regulation has been adopted for the
same purpose in developing municipality after developing municipality. Almost

every one acts solely in its own selfish and parochial
interest and in effect builds a wall around itself to keep out those people or
entities not

adding favorably to the tax base, despite the location of
the municipality or the demand for varied kinds of housing. There has been no
effective

intermunicipal or area planning or land use regulation. * *

* One incongruous result is the picture of developing municipalities rendering
  it

impossible for lower paid employees of industries they have
eagerly sought and welcomed with open arms (and, in Mount Laurel’s case, even

some of its own lower paid municipal employees) to live in
the community where they work. * * *

II

The Legal Issue

The legal question before us, as earlier indicated, is
whether a developing municipality like Mount Laurel may validly, by a system of

#1099

land use regulation, make it physically and economically
impossible to provide low and moderate income housing in the municipality for
the

various categories of persons who need and want it and
thereby, as Mount Laurel has, exclude such people from living within its
confines

because of the limited extent of their income and resources.
Necessarily implicated are the broader questions of the right of such
municipalities to

limit the kinds of available housing and of any obligation
to make possible a variety and choice of types of living accommodations.

We conclude that every such municipality must, by its land
use regulations, presumptively make realistically possible an appropriate
variety

and choice of housing. More specifically, presumptively it
cannot foreclose the opportunity of the classes of people mentioned for low and

moderate income housing and in its regulations must
affirmatively afford that opportunity, at least to the extent of the
municipality’s fair share of

the present and prospective regional need therefor. These
obligations must be met unless the particular municipality can sustain the
heavy burden

of demonstrating peculiar circumstances which dictate that
it should not be required so to do.^10

We reach this conclusion under state law and so do not find
it necessary to consider federal constitutional grounds urged by plaintiffs. We

begin with some fundamental principles as applied to the
scene before us.

Land use regulation is encompassed within the state’s police
power. * * *

It is elementary theory that all police power enactments, no
matter at what level of government, must conform to the basic state

constitutional requirements of substantive due process and
equal protection of the laws. These are inherent in Art. I, par. 1 of our
Constitution,^11

the requirements of which may be more demanding than those
of the federal Constitution. It is required that, affirmatively, a zoning
regulation,

like any police power enactment, must promote public health,
safety, morals or the general welfare. (The last term seems broad enough to

encompass the others.) Conversely, a zoning enactment which
is contrary to the general welfare is invalid. * * *

* * * Frequently the decisions in this state * * * have
      spoken only in terms of the interest of the enacting municipality, so that it
      has been

thought, at least in some quarters, that such was the only
welfare requiring consideration. It is, of course, true that many cases have
dealt

#1100

only with regulations having little, if any, outside impact
where the local decision is ordinarily entitled to prevail. However, it is
fundamental and

not to be forgotten that the zoning power is a police power
of the state and the local authority is acting only as a delegate of that power
and is

restricted in the same manner as is the state. So, when
regulation does have a substantial external impact, the welfare of the state’s
citizens

beyond the borders of the particular municipality cannot be
disregarded and must be recognized and served. * * *

This essential was distinctly pointed out in Euclid, where
Mr. Justice Sutherland specifically referred to “ * * * the possibility of
cases

where the general public interest would so far outweigh the
interest of the municipality that the municipality would not be allowed to
stand in the

way.” (272 U.S. at 390). * * *

This brings us to the relation of housing to the concept of
general welfare just discussed and the result in terms of land use regulation
which

that relationship mandates. There cannot be the slightest
doubt that shelter, along with food, are the most basic human needs. * * *

It is plain beyond dispute that proper provision for
adequate housing of all categories of people is certainly an absolute essential
in

promotion of the general welfare required in all local land
use regulation. Further the universal and constant need for such housing is so

important and of such broad public interest that the general
welfare which developing municipalities like Mount Laurel must consider extends

beyond their boundaries and cannot be parochially confined
to the claimed good of the particular municipality. It has to follow that,
broadly

speaking, the presumptive obligation arises for each such
municipality affirmatively to plan and provide, by its land use regulations,
the

reasonable opportunity for an appropriate variety and choice
of housing, including, of course, low and moderate cost housing, to meet the
needs,

desires and resources of all categories of people who may
desire to live within its boundaries. Negatively, it may not adopt regulations
or policies

which thwart or preclude that opportunity.

It is also entirely clear, as we pointed out earlier, that
most developing municipalities, including Mount Laurel, have not met their

affirmative or negative obligations, primarily for local
fiscal reasons. * * *

We have spoken of this obligation of such municipalities as
“presumptive.” The term has two aspects, procedural and substantive.

Procedurally, we think the basic importance of appropriate
housing for all dictates that, when it is shown that a developing municipality
in its

land use regulations has not made realistically possible a
variety and choice of housing, including adequate provision to afford the
opportunity

for low and moderate income housing or has expressly
prescribed requirements or restrictions which preclude or substantially hinder
it, a facial

showing of violation of substantive due process or equal
protection under the state constitution has been made out and the burden, and
it is a

heavy one, shifts to the municipality to establish a valid
basis for its

#1101

action or non-action. The substantive aspect of
“presumptive” relates to the specifics, on the one hand, of what municipal land
use regulation

provisions, or the absence thereof, will evidence invalidity
and shift the burden of proof and, on the other hand, of what bases and
considerations

will carry the municipality’s burden and sustain what it has
done or failed to do. Both kinds of specifics may well vary between
municipalities

according to peculiar circumstances.

We turn to application of these principles in appraisal of
Mount Laurel’s zoning ordinance, useful as well, we think, as guidelines for
future

application in other municipalities. * * *

[O]ur opinion is that Mount Laurel’s zoning ordinance is
presumptively contrary to the general welfare and outside the intended scope of

the zoning power in the particulars mentioned. A facial
showing of invalidity is thus established, shifting to the municipality the
burden of

establishing valid superseding reasons for its action and
non-action. We now examine the reasons it advances.

The township’s principal reason in support of its zoning
plan and ordinance housing provisions, advanced especially strongly at oral

argument, is the fiscal one previously adverted to, i.e. ,
that by reason of New Jersey’s tax structure which substantially finances
municipal

governmental and educational costs from taxes on local real
property, every municipality may, by the exercise of the zoning power, allow
only

such uses and to such extent as will be beneficial to the
local tax rate. * * *

We have previously held that a developing municipality may
properly zone for and seek industrial ratables to create a better economic

balance for the community vis-a-vis educational and
governmental costs engendered by residential development, provided that such
was “ * * *

done reasonably as part of and in furtherance of a
legitimate comprehensive plan for the zoning of the entire municipality.”
Gruber v. Mayor and

Township Committee of Raritan Township, 186 A.2d 489, 493
(N.J. 1962). We adhere to that view today. But we were not there concerned
with,

and did not pass upon, the validity of municipal exclusion
by zoning of types of housing and kinds of people for the same local financial
end. We

have no hesitancy in now saying, and do so emphatically,
that, considering the basic importance of the opportunity for appropriate
housing for all

classes of our citizenry, no municipality may exclude or
limit categories of housing for that reason or purpose. While we fully
recognize the

increasingly heavy burden of local taxes for municipal
governmental and school costs on homeowners, relief from the consequences of
this tax

system will have to be furnished by other branches of
government. It cannot legitimately be accomplished by restricting types of
housing through

the zoning process in developing municipalities. * * *

By way of summary, what we have said comes down to this. As
a developing municipality, Mount Laurel must, by its land use regulations,

#1102

make realistically possible the opportunity for an
appropriate variety and choice of housing for all categories of people who may
desire to live

there, of course including those of low and moderate income.
It must permit multifamily housing, without bedroom or similar restrictions, as

well as small dwellings on very small lots, low cost housing
of other types and, in general, high density zoning, without artificial and

unjustifiable minimum requirements as to lot size, building
size and the like, to meet the full panoply of these needs. Certainly when a

municipality zones for industry and commerce for local tax
benefit purposes, it without question must zone to permit adequate housing
within the

means of the employees involved in such uses. (If planned
unit developments are authorized, one would assume that each must include a

reasonable amount of low and moderate income housing in its
residential “mix,” unless opportunity for such housing has already been

realistically provided for elsewhere in the municipality.)
The amount of land removed from residential use by allocation to industrial and

commercial purposes must be reasonably related to the
present and future potential for such purposes. In other words, such
municipalities must

zone primarily for the living welfare of people and not for
the benefit of the local tax rate.^20

* * * Frequently it might be sounder to have more of such
      housing, like some specialized land uses, in one municipality in a region than
      in

another, because of greater availability of suitable land,
location of employment, accessibility of public transportation or some other
significant

reason. But, under present New Jersey legislation, zoning
must be on an individual municipal basis, rather than regionally. So long as
that

situation persists under the present tax structure, or in
the absence of some kind of binding agreement among all the municipalities of a
region,

we feel that every municipality therein must bear its fair
share of the regional burden. (In this respect our holding is broader than that
of the trial

court, which was limited to Mount Laurel-related low and
moderate income housing needs.)

The composition of the applicable “region” will necessarily
vary from situation to situation and probably no hard and fast rule will serve
to

furnish the answer in every case. Confinement to or within a
certain county appears not to be realistic, but restriction within the
boundaries of the

state seem practical and advisable. (This is not to say that
a developing municipality can ignore a demand for housing within its boundaries
on

the part of people who commute to work in another state.)
Here we have already defined the region at present as “those portions of
Camden,

Burlington and Gloucester Counties within a semicircle
having a radius of 20 miles or so from the heart of Camden City.” The concept
of “fair

share” is coming into more general use and, through the
expertise of the municipal planning adviser, the county planning boards and the
state

planning agency, a reasonable figure for Mount Laurel can be

#1103

determined, which can then be translated to the allocation
of sufficient land therefor on the zoning map. * * *

There is no reason why developing municipalities like Mount
Laurel, required by this opinion to afford the opportunity for all types of

housing to meet the needs of various categories of people,
may not become and remain attractive, viable communities providing good living
and

adequate services for all their residents in the kind of
atmosphere which a democracy and free institutions demand. They can have
industrial

sections, commercial sections and sections for every kind of
housing from low cost and multi-family to lots of more than an acre with very

expensive homes. Proper planning and governmental
cooperation can prevent over-intensive and too sudden development, insure
against future

suburban sprawl and slums and assure the preservation of
open space and local beauty. We do not intend that developing municipalities
shall be

overwhelmed by voracious land speculators and developers if
they use the powers which they have intelligently and in the broad public
interest.

Under our holdings today, they can be better communities for
all than they previously have been.

III

The Remedy

* * * We are of the view that the trial court’s judgment
      should be modified in certain respects. We see no reason why the entire zoning

ordinance should be nullified. Therefore we declare it to be
invalid only to the extent and in the particulars set forth in this opinion.
The township

is granted 90 days from the date hereof, or such additional
time as the trial court may find it reasonable and necessary to allow, to adopt

amendments to correct the deficiencies herein specified. It
is the local function and responsibility, in the first instance at least,
rather than the

court’s, to decide on the details of the same within the
guidelines we have laid down. If plaintiffs desire to attack such amendments,
they may do

so by supplemental complaint filed in this cause within 30
days of the final adoption of the amendments.

We are not at all sure what the trial judge had in mind as
ultimate action with reference to the approval of a plan for affirmative public

action concerning the satisfaction of indicated housing
needs and the entry of a final order requiring implementation thereof. Courts
do not build

housing nor do municipalities. That function is performed by
private builders, various kinds of associations, or, for public housing, by
special

agencies created for that purpose at various levels of
government. The municipal function is initially to provide the opportunity
through

appropriate land use regulations and we have spelled out
what Mount Laurel must do in that regard. It is not appropriate at this time,
particularly

in view of the advanced view of zoning law as applied to
housing laid down by this opinion, to deal with the matter of the further
extent of

judicial power in the field or to exercise any such power.
The municipality should first have full opportunity to itself act without

#1104

judicial supervision. We trust it will do so in the spirit
we have suggested, both by appropriate zoning ordinance amendments and whatever

additional action encouraging the fulfillment of its fair
share of the regional need for low and moderate income housing may be indicated
as

necessary and advisable. (We have in mind that there is at
least a moral obligation in a municipality to establish a local housing agency
pursuant

to state law to provide housing for its resident poor now
living in dilapidated, unhealthy quarters.) * * * Should Mount Laurel not
perform as we

expect, further judicial action may be sought by
supplemental pleading in this cause.

The judgment of the Law Division is modified as set forth
herein. No costs.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .New Jersey’s experience with judicial remedies for
exclusionary zoning has been almost unique. After this case, developers still
found it

difficult to get approval for low- and moderate-income
housing, in the face of the many obstacles towns could set up. In _Southern
Burlington County

NAACP v. Township of Mount Laurel_ ( _Mount Laurel II_ ),
456 A. 2 d 390 (N.J. 1983 ), the court sought to strengthen its approach with a
“builder’s remedy”

(an injunction requiring a permit for a builder who has
succeeded in _Mount Laurel_ - type litigation) and the possibility that a court
would order a revision

in the zoning ordinance. The court also held that
affirmative measures by municipalities, such as incentive zoning and
set-asides, were within the

constitutionally delegated power to zone and within the
range of remedies that a court could order. More recently the New Jersey
Supreme Court has

upheld as constitutional New Jersey legislation that set up
a Council on Affordable Housing that would decide what a municipality’s fair
share of low-

and moderate-income housing would be, would pass on whether
measures satisfy this obligation, and would approve regional agreements. Hills

Development Co. v. Township of Bernards, 510 A. 2 d 621
(N.J. 1986 ) (sometimes known as “ _Mount Laurel III_ ”). Other states have
either not found any

violation in exclusionary zoning or have adopted milder
approaches than New Jersey’s. For example, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has
adopted a

“fair share” analysis but generally restricts remedies to
cases in which localities try to impose blanket prohibitions on certain types
of uses. See BAC,

Inc. v. Board of Supervisors, 633 A. 2 d 144 (Pa. 1993 )
(holding that challenger had not met its burden where some mobile homes were
allowed).

2 .Many techniques have been alleged to be implicated in
exclusionary zoning. These include minimum lot sizes and restrictions or
prohibition on

mobile homes. What if a town has never used any of these
measures but still has little low- or moderate-income housing? According to the
_Mount

Laurel_ line of decisions, would an already developed town
have an affirmative obligation to provide low- and moderate-income housing?
What about an

older town that is gentrifying? Like zoning in general,
various techniques serve multiple purposes, potentially benign and
exclusionary, and the mix can

change over time. Historically, ordinances ostensibly aimed

```



1105



```

at preserving open space were often regarded as cover for
exclusionary zoning. These days for a variety of reasons, open space
initiatives have gained in

popularity. Does this make them less exclusionary? How

Open-Space

3 .The court cites to the _Euclid_ case. Recall Justice
Sutherland’s nuisance analogy and characterization of apartment houses as
“parasites.” Also,

the scheme there even limited duplexes. Was Euclid’s scheme
an example of exclusionary zoning?

4 .The _Mount Laurel_ cases rested on the state
constitution. Although the federal constitution has never been interpreted in a
similar way, other

federal law is relevant to the problem of exclusionary
zoning. Consider the Fair Housing Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 , supra
Chapter IV. For

some of the literature on racial and social exclusion, see,
e.g., Charles M. Haar, Suburbs Under Siege: Race, Space, and Audacious Judges (
1996 );

Richard Thompson Ford, The Boundaries of Race: Political
Geography in Legal Action, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 1941 ( 1994 ).

5 .The type of housing at issue in _Mount Laurel_ was
finally unanimously approved in 1997 , despite protests by opponents. For
developments

subsequent to _Mount Laurel_ and a discussion of the
effectiveness of the moves and countermoves of government and housing
organizations, see

Ellickson et al., supra, at 679 – 90. A legislative
alternative to _Mount Laurel_ - style cases is Massachusetts’ “anti-snob
zoning” act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch.

40 B, §§ 20 to 23 , which provides for a builder’s remedy if
a locality fails to achieve targets such as a housing stock with 10 %
affordable housing. The

evidence of how much _Mount Laurel_ or the Massachusetts
statute has contributed to the supply of low- and moderate-income housing is
mixed at best.

One problem is that municipalities can keep the denominator
in their housing stock low by pursuing open space initiatives with extra vigor.

“overburden,” consisting of soil, subsoil, and rock was blasted loose then

was dug deeper, waste rock was likewise blasted loose and
stockpiled. The resulting mass of overburden and waste rock is unsightly and so
large that residents of Palmer have nicknamed it

“Mt. Palmer” and say that it causes their town to have early

(^11) We are of the opinion that this kind of analysis is
generally only required in a nuisance case and that it is better to preserve
that aspect of traditional trespass analysis requiring no

proof of actual injury because the invasion of the
plaintiff’s right to exclude was regarded as tortious by itself.

(^12) This holds even if the noise or vibrations are so
intense as to shatter all glass and fell all masonry or otherwise so persistent
as to drive all persons from the premises. Although such

hazards would indeed infringe on a landowner’s possessory
interest, it is the interest in use and enjoyment of the premises, not in
exclusion from them, and therefore the cause of action lies

not in trespass, but in nuisance or the related doctrines of
negligence or strict liability.

(^15) We note that the Restatement itself presents its rule
as a departure from the traditional requirement of a direct or immediate
invasion. 1 Restatement Torts, 2 d, § 158 , comment i, pp.

278 – 279 (“it is not necessary that the foreign matter
should be thrown directly and immediately upon the other’s land”). We would,
however, adopt the Restatement’s formulation as a

liberalization, not a rejection, of the strictest sense of
the traditional requirement for a direct or immediate invasion. Accordingly,
rather than reject this traditional requirement, we preserve

this requirement as something akin to proximate cause,
meaning “that which, in a natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any
efficient intervening cause, produces the injury and

without which the accident could not have happened, if the
injury be one which might be reasonably anticipated or foreseen.” Black’s Law
Dictionary ( 6 th ed.), p. 1225.

(^4) The traditional elements of an implied easement are:

( 2 ) before severance, the common owner used part of the
property for the benefit of the other part, a use that was apparent, obvious,
continuous and [permanent];

( 3 ) and the claimed easement is necessary and beneficial
to the enjoyment of the parcel previously benefitted.

elements as the law of this state and we do not do so here.

(^1) Civil Code section 1008 provides: “No use by any person
or persons, no matter how long continued, of any land, shall ever ripen into an
easement by prescription, if the owner of such

property posts at each entrance to the property or at
intervals of not more than 200 feet along the boundary a sign reading
substantially as follows: ‘Right to pass by permission, and subject to

control, of owner: Section 1008 , Civil Code.’ ”

(^1) We note in passing that the Restatement of Property,
section 537 , takes the position that a promise as to the use of land is
binding upon successors of the promisor only if the

performance will result in benefit “in the physical use or
enjoyment of the land.” Comment (f) states: “ _Physical use or enjoyment_. For
a promise to run with the land of the promisor it is not

enough that the performance of the promise operates to
benefit either the promisor or the beneficiary of the promise in the use of his
land but it must operate to benefit him in the physical use

of his land. It must in some way make the use or enjoyment
more satisfactory to his physical senses. It is not enough that the income from
it is increased by virtue of it.” (Accord: Daniels v.

Notor, 389 Pa. 510 , 133 A. 2 d 520 .)

Since the validity of the restrictions, as such, is not in
issue in the present case, it is unnecessary to consider whether section 537 is
the law of California. The section is mentioned as

further recognition that deed restrictions have some legally
protected purpose other than economic benefit.

desire to secure decent housing and accompanying advantages within

their means elsewhere; ( 4 ) three organizations
representing the housing and other interests of racial minorities. * * *

(^10) While, as the trial court found, Mount Laurel’s
actions were deliberate, we are of the view that the identical conclusion
follows even when municipal conduct is not shown to be

intentional, but the effect is substantially the same as if
it were.

(^11) The paragraph reads:

All persons are by nature free and independent, and have
certain natural and unalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and
defending life and liberty, of acquiring,

possessing, and protecting property, and of pursuing and
obtaining safety and happiness.

(^20) This case does not properly present the question of
whether a developing municipality may time its growth and, if so, how. * * *

## CHAPTER X

# GOVERNMENT FORBEARANCE AND TAKINGS

There is a longstanding debate about the relationship
between government and property. Locke famously argued that property rights

originate in the state of nature, and government was created
to protect these rights. See John Locke, Two Treatises of Civil Government bk.
II,

ch. V (1690). Bentham responded bluntly that “[p]roperty and
law are born together, and die together. Before laws were made there was no

property; take away laws, and property ceases.” Jeremy
Bentham, The Theory of Legislation 113 (C.K. Ogden ed., 1931) (1802). The
debate is

largely philosophical; the historical record is too murky to
provide a definite answer to the question whether property is “pre-political”
or “post-

political,” at least insofar as most property rights that
exist today are concerned. Whatever the role of the state in bringing property
into being,

there is no question that government action affects property
rights in a great many important ways. As Blackstone observed, even if “[t]he

original of private property is probably founded in nature,”
nevertheless “the method of conserving it in the present owner, and of
translating it

from man to man, are entirely derived from society.” 1
Blackstone, Commentaries *134.

In this Chapter, we focus on the question of how much the
government should forbear from interfering with, or frustrating, previously

recognized property rights. This general inquiry entails
several subsidiary questions: How explicit must the government’s promise of
forbearance

be before property owners can justifiably rely upon it? What
sort of reasons suffice to permit the government to break its promise of
forbearance?

If the government breaks its promise, and has no adequate
justification for doing so, what sort of remedies should the courts give to
someone

who has been injured by the government’s lack of
forbearance?

In the United States, these questions have commonly been
addressed as a matter of constitutional law. During roughly the first century
after

the adoption of the U.S. Constitution, the clause invoked
most frequently as a basis for adjudicating claims of inadequate forbearance
was the

Contracts Clause of Article I, § 10, which provides that no
state shall pass any law “impairing the obligation of contract.” The Supreme
Court

held in Fletcher v. Peck , 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 87 (1810),
that the obligation of contract includes grants of property in land, and then
ruled in

Dartmouth College v. Woodward , 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 518
(1819), that it also includes corporate charters. These decisions laid the
groundwork for

a jurisprudence in which the Court reviewed a wide

#1108

range of claims of inadequate government forbearance under
the Contracts Clause. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the action
shifted

toward the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments, which the courts interpreted to impose certain substantive
restraints on

government action depriving individuals of private rights.
Lochner v. New York , 198 U.S. 45 (1905), in which the Court invalidated a
maximum

hours regulation as interfering with liberty of contract, is
the most famous decision of this era. But the Court also held that state
interferences

with the expectations of property owners could violate due
process. See, e.g., Truax v. Corrigan, 257 U.S. 312 (1921); Missouri Pac. Ry.
v.

Nebraska, 164 U.S. 403 (1896); see Ronald J. Krotoszynski,
Jr., Fundamental Property Rights, 85 Geo. L.J. 555, 561–67 (1997).

In recent decades, the dominant clause for addressing these
issues has become the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which has been

held to apply to the states through the Fourteenth
Amendment. The Takings Clause provides: “nor shall private property be taken
for public use

without just compensation.” This Clause functions in part to
regulate the power of eminent domain, considered in Part C. But the Court has
also

drawn upon the Clause for the understanding that certain
regulations of property can go “too far,” to the point where the government
must

proceed by eminent domain, i.e. compensate the owner, rather
than by police power regulation. This understanding, which is called the

“regulatory takings” doctrine, is taken up in Part D.

Although constitutional constraints have been the focal
point for discussion about the proper degree of government forbearance in

interfering with property rights, government forbearance is
also encouraged by nonconstitutional doctrines. In Part B we consider some of
these

doctrines, including the rule of construction favoring
vested rights, the doctrine favoring a strong version of stare decisis in
matters involving

property rights, and foreign investment protection treaties.
But first, we consider a classic Supreme Court decision that raises questions
about

government forbearance with a degree of explicitness that
has rarely been matched in any subsequent decision.

### A. THE GENERAL PROBLEM

#### Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge

```



Supreme Court of the United States, 1837.



36 U.S. ( 11 Pet.) 420.



```

■ MR.
CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY delivered the opinion of the court. The questions involved
in this case are of the gravest character, and the court have

given to them the most anxious and deliberate consideration.

---

It appears, from the record, that in the year 1 650, the
legislature of Massachusetts granted to the president of Harvard College “the
liberty

and power,” to dispose of the ferry from Charlestown to
Boston, by lease

#1109

or otherwise, in the behalf, and for the behoof, of the
college; and that under that grant, the college continued to hold and keep the
ferry, by its

lessees or agents, and to receive the profits of it, until
1785. In the last-mentioned year, a petition was presented to the legislature,
by Thomas

Russell and others, stating the inconvenience of the
transportation by ferries, over Charles river, and the public advantages that
would result from

a bridge; and praying to be incorporated, for the purpose of
erecting a bridge in the place where the ferry between Boston and Charlestown
was

then kept. Pursuant to this petition, the legislature, on
the 9th of March 1785, passed an act incorporating a company, by the name of
“The

Proprietors of the Charles River Bridge,” for the purposes
mentioned in the petition. Under this charter, the company were empowered to
erect a

bridge, in “the place where the ferry was then kept;”
certain tolls were granted, and the charter was limited to forty years from the
first opening

of the bridge for passengers; and from the time the toll
commenced, until the expiration of this term, the company were to pay £200,
annually, to

Harvard College; and at the expiration of the forty years,
the bridge was to be the property of the commonwealth; “saving (as the law
expresses

it) to the said college or university, a reasonable annual
compensation, for the annual income of the ferry, which they might have
received, had

not the said bridge been erected.”

The bridge was accordingly built, and was opened for
passengers on the 17th of June 1786. In 1792, the charter was extended to
seventy

years from the opening of the bridge; and at the expiration
of that time, it was to belong to the commonwealth. The corporation have
regularly

paid to the college the annual sum of £200 and have
performed all of the duties imposed on them by the terms of their charter.

In 1828, the legislature of Massachusetts incorporated a
company by the name of “The Proprietors of the Warren Bridge,” for the purpose
of

erecting another bridge over Charles river. This bridge is
only sixteen rods, at its commencement, on the Charlestown side, from the

commencement of the bridge of the plaintiffs; and they are
about fifty rods apart, at their termination on the Boston side. The travellers
who pass

over either bridge, proceed from Charlestown square, which
receives the travel of many great public roads leading from the country; and
the

passengers and travellers who go to and from Boston, used to
pass over the Charles River bridge, from and through this square, before the

erection of the Warren bridge.

The Warren bridge, by the terms of its charter, was to be
surrendered to the state, as soon as the expenses of the proprietors in
building and

supporting it should be reimbursed; but this period was not,
in any event, to exceed six years from the time the company commenced receiving

toll.

When the original bill in this case was filed, the Warren
bridge had not been built; and the bill was filed, after the passage of the
law, in

order to obtain an injunction to prevent its erection, and
for general relief. The bill, among other things, charged as a ground for
relief, that the act

for the erection of the Warren bridge impaired the
obligation of the contract between the commonwealth and the proprietors of the
Charles River

bridge; and was, therefore, repugnant to the constitution of
the United States. Afterwards, a supplemental bill was filed, stating that the
bridge

had then been so far completed, that it had been opened for
travel, and that divers persons had passed over, and thus avoided the payment
of the

toll, which would otherwise have been received by the
plaintiffs. * * * In the argument here, it was admitted, that since the filing
of the

supplemental bill, a sufficient amount of toll had been
reserved by the proprietors of the Warren bridge to reimburse all their
expenses, and that

the bridge is now the property of the state, and has been
made a free bridge; and that the value of the franchise granted to the
proprietors of the

Charles River bridge, has by this means been entirely
destroyed. * * *

A good deal of evidence has been offered, to show the nature
and extent of the ferry-right granted to the college; and also to show the
rights

claimed by the proprietors of the bridge, at different
times, by virtue of their charter; and the opinions entertained by committees
of the

legislature, and others, upon that subject. But as these
circumstances do not affect the judgment of this court, it is unnecessary to
recapitulate

them.

The plaintiffs in error insist, mainly, upon two grounds:
1st. That by virtue of the grant of 1650, Harvard College was entitled, in
perpetuity,

to the right of keeping a ferry between Charlestown and
Boston; that this

#1111

right was exclusive; and that the legislature had not the
power to establish another ferry on the same line of travel, because it would
infringe the

rights of the college; and that these rights, upon the
erection of the bridge in the place of the ferry, under the charter of 1785,
were transferred to,

and became vested in “The Proprietors of the Charles River
Bridge;” and that under, and by virtue of this transfer of the ferry-right, the
rights of

the bridge company were as exclusive in that line of travel,
as the rights of the ferry. 2d. That independently of the ferry-right, the acts
of the

legislature of Massachusetts, of 1785 and 179 2, by their
true construction, necessarily implied, that the legislature would not
authorize another

bridge, and especially, a free one, by the side of this, and
placed in the same line of travel, whereby the franchise granted to the
“Proprietors of

the Charles River Bridge” should be rendered of no value;
and the plaintiffs in error contend, that the grant of the ferry to the
college, and of the

charter to the proprietors of the bridge, are both contracts
on the part of the state; and that the law authorizing the erection of the
Warren bridge in

1828, impairs the obligation of one or both of these
contracts.

It is very clear, that in the form in which this case comes
before us (being a writ of error to a state court), the plaintiffs, in claiming
under

either of these rights, must place themselves on the ground
of contract, and cannot support themselves upon the principle, that the law
divests

vested rights. It is well settled, by the decisions of this
court, that a state law may be retrospective in its character, and may divest
vested rights,

and yet not violate the constitution of the United States,
unless it also impairs the obligation of a contract. [Satterlee v. Matthewson,
27 U.S. (2

Pet.) 380 (1829); Watson v. Mercer, 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 88
(1834)]: * * * After these solemn decisions of this court, it is apparent, that
the plaintiffs

in error * * * must show, that the state had entered into a
contract with them, or those under whom they claim, not to establish a free
bridge at the

place where the Warren bridge is erected. Such, and such
only, are the principles upon which the plaintiffs in error can claim relief in
this case.

The nature and extent of the ferry right granted to Harvard
College, in 1650, must depend upon the laws of Massachusetts; and the character

and extent of this right has been elaborately discussed at
the bar. But in the view which the court take of the case before them, it is
not necessary

to express any opinion on these questions. * * *

The fact that such a right was granted to the college,
cannot, by any sound rule of construction, be used to extend the privileges of
the

bridge company, beyond what the words of the charter
naturally and legally import. Increased population, longer experience in
legislation, the

different character of the corporations which owned the
ferry from that which owned the bridge, might well have induced a change in the
policy

of the state in this respect * * *. The charter to the
bridge is a written

#1112

instrument which must speak for itself, and be interpreted
by its own terms. * * *

Much has been said in the argument of the principles of
construction by which this law is to be expounded, and what undertakings, on
the

part of the state, may be implied. The court think there can
be no serious difficulty on that head. It is the grant of certain franchises,
by the public,

to a private corporation, and in a matter where the public
interest is concerned. The rule of construction in such cases is well settled,
both in

England, and by the decisions of our own tribunals. In the
case of the Proprietors of the Stourbridge Canal v. Wheeley and others , (1831)
109

Eng. Rep. 1336 (K.B.), the court say, “the canal having been
made under an act of parliament, the rights of the plaintiffs are derived
entirely from

that act. This, like many other cases, is a bargain between
a company of adventurers and the public, the terms of which are expressed in
the

statute; and the rule of construction in all such cases, is
now fully established to be this—that any ambiguity in the terms of the
contract, must

operate against the adventurers, and in favor of the public,
and the plaintiffs can claim nothing that is not clearly given them by the
act.” And the

doctrine thus laid down is abundantly sustained by the
authorities referred to in this decision. * * *

Borrowing, as we have done, our system of jurisprudence from
the English law; and having adopted, in every other case, civil and criminal,

its rules for the construction of statutes; is there
anything in our local situation, or in the nature of our political
institutions, which should lead us

to depart from the principle, where corporations are
concerned? * * * We think not; and it would present a singular spectacle, if,
while the courts

in England are restraining, within the strictest limits, the
spirit of monopoly, and exclusive privileges in nature of monopolies, and
confining

corporations to the privileges plainly given to them in
their charter; the courts of this country should be found enlarging these
privileges by

implication; and construing a statute more unfavorably to
the public, and to the rights of community, than would be done in a like case
in an

English court of justice. * * *

Adopting the rule of construction above stated as the
settled one, we proceed to apply it to the charter of 1785, to the proprietors
of the

Charles River bridge. This act of incorporation is in the
usual form, and the privileges such as are commonly given to corporations of
that kind. It

confers on them the ordinary faculties of a corporation, for
the purpose of building the bridge; and establishes certain rates of toll,
which the

company are authorized to take: this is the whole grant.
There is no exclusive privilege given to them over the waters of Charles river,
above or

below their bridge; no right to erect another bridge
themselves, nor to prevent other persons from erecting one, no engagement from
the state,

that another shall not be erected; and no undertaking not to
sanction competition, nor to make improvements that may diminish the amount of
its

income. Upon all these subject, the charter is silent; and
nothing is

#1113

said in it about a line of travel, so much insisted on in
the argument, in which they are to have exclusive privileges. No words are
used, from

which an intention to grant any of these rights can be
inferred; if the plaintiff is entitled to them, it must be implied, simply,
from the nature of the

grant; and cannot be inferred, from the words by which the
grant is made.

The relative position of the Warren bridge has already been
described. It does not interrupt the passage over the Charles River bridge, nor

make the way to it, or from it, less convenient. None of the
faculties or franchises granted to that corporation, have been revoked by the

legislature; and its right to take the tolls granted by the
charter remains unaltered. In short, all the franchises and rights of property,
enumerated in

the charter, and there mentioned to have been granted to it,
remain unimpaired. But its income is destroyed by the Warren bridge; which,
being

free, draws off the passengers and property which would have
gone over it, and renders their franchise of no value. This is the gist of the

complaint; for it is not pretended, that the erection of the
Warren bridge would have done them any injury, or in any degree affected their
right of

property, if it had not diminished the amount of their
tolls. In order, then, to entitle themselves to relief, it is necessary to
show, that the

legislature contracted not to do the act of which they
complain; and that they impaired, or in other words, violated, that contract,
by the erection

of the Warren bridge. * * *

If a contract on that subject can be gathered from the
charter, it must be by implication; and cannot be found in the words used. Can
such an

agreement be implied? The rule of construction before stated
is an answer to the question: in charters of this description, no rights are
taken from

the public, or given to the corporation, beyond those which
the words of the charter, by their natural and proper construction, purport to
convey.

There are no words which import such a contract as the
plaintiffs in error contend for, and none can be implied[.] * * *

Indeed, the practice and usage of almost every state in the
Union, old enough to have commenced the work of internal improvement, is

opposed to the doctrine contended for on the part of the
plaintiffs in error. Turnpike roads have been made in succession, on the same
line of

travel; the later ones interfering materially with the
profits of the first. These corporations have, in some instances, been utterly
ruined by the

introduction of newer and better modes of transportation and
travelling. In some cases, railroads have rendered the turnpike roads on the
same

line of travel so entirely useless, that the franchise of
the turnpike corporation is not worth preserving. Yet in none of these cases
have the

corporation supposed that their privileges were invaded, or
any contract violated on the part of the state. * * * The absence of any such

controversy, when there must have been so many occasions to
give rise to it, proves, that neither states, nor individuals, nor
corporations, ever

imagined that such a contract could be implied from such
charters. * * *

#1114

And what would be the fruits of this doctrine of implied
contracts, on the part of the states, and of property in a line of travel, by a

corporation, if it would now be sanctioned by this court? To
what results would it lead us? If it is to be found in the charter to this
bridge, the

same process of reasoning must discover it, in the various
acts which have been passed, within the last forty years, for turnpike
companies. And

what is to be the extent of the privileges of exclusion on
the different sides of the road? The counsel who have so ably argued this case,
have not

attempted to define it by any certain boundaries. How far
must the new improvement be distant from the old one? How near may you
approach,

without invading its rights in the privileged line? If this
court should establish the principles now contended for, what is to become of
the

numerous railroads established on the same line of travel
with turnpike companies; and which have rendered the franchises of the turnpike

corporations of no value? Let it once be understood, that
such charters carry with them these implied contracts, and give this unknown
and

undefined property in a line of traveling; and you will soon
find the old turnpike corporations awakening from their sleep, and calling upon
this

court to put down the improvements which have taken their
place. The millions of property which have been invested in railroads and
canals,

upon lines of travel which had been before occupied by
turnpike corporations, will be put in jeopardy. We shall be thrown back to the

improvements of the last century, and obliged to stand
still, until the claims of the old turnpike corporations shall be satisfied;
and they shall

consent to permit these states to avail themselves of the
lights of modern science, and to partake of the benefit of those improvements
which are

now adding to the wealth and prosperity, and the convenience
and comfort, of every other part of the civilized world. Nor is this all. This
court

will find itself compelled to fix, by some arbitrary rule,
the width of this new kind of property in a line of travel; for if such a right
of property

exists, we have no lights to guide us in marking out its
extent, unless, indeed, we * * * are prepared to decide that when a turnpike
road from one

town to another, had been made, no railroad or canal,
between these two points, could afterwards be established. This court are not
prepared to

sanction principles which must lead to such results. * * *

The judgment of the supreme judicial court of the
commonwealth of Massachusetts, dismissing the plaintiffs’ bill, must,
therefore, be

affirmed, with costs.

■ MR.
JUSTICE MCLEAN. [omitted].

■ MR.
JUSTICE STORY, dissenting. * * * [B]efore we can properly enter upon the
consideration of this subject, a preliminary inquiry is presented,

as to the proper rules of interpretation applicable to the
charter. * * *

It is a well-known rule in the construction of private
grants, if the meaning of the words be doubtful, to construe them most strongly
against

the grantor. But it is said, that an opposite rule prevails
in cases of grants by the king; for, where there is any doubt, the construction
is made most

#1115

favorably for the king, and against the grantee. The rule is
not disputed; but it is a rule of very limited application. To what cases does
it apply?

---

[T]his doctrine in relation to the king’s prerogative of
having a construction in his own favor, is exclusively confined to cases of
mere

donation , flowing from the bounty of the crown. Whenever
the grant is upon a valuable consideration, the rule of construction ceases;
and the

grant is expounded exactly as it would be in the case of a
private grant—favorably to the grantee. Why is this rule adopted? Plainly,
because the

grant is a contract, and is to be interpreted according to
its fair meaning. It would be to the dishonor of the government, that it should
pocket a

fair consideration, and then quibble as to the obscurities
and implications of its own contract. * * *

But it has been argued, and the argument has been pressed in
every form which ingenuity could suggest, that if grants of this nature are to
be

construed liberally, as conferring any exclusive rights on
the grantees, it will interpose an effectual barrier against all general
improvements of

the country. * * * For my own part, I can conceive of no
surer plan to arrest all public improvements, founded on private capital and
enterprise,

than to make the outlay of that capital uncertain and
questionable, both as to security and as to productiveness. No man will hazard
his capital in

any enterprise, in which, if there be a loss, it must be
borne exclusively by himself; and if there be success, he has not the slightest
security of

enjoying the rewards of that success, for a single moment.
If the government means to invite its citizens to enlarge the public comforts
and

conveniences, to establish bridges, or turnpikes, or canals,
or railroads, there must be some pledge, that the property will be safe; that
the

enjoyment will be co-extensive with the grant; and that
success will not be the signal of a general combination to overthrow its rights
and to take

away its profits. The very agitation of a question of this
sort is sufficient to alarm every stockholder in every public enterprise of
this sort,

throughout the whole country. Already, in my native state,
the legislature has found it necessary expressly to concede the exclusive
privilege here

contended against; in order to insure the accomplishment of
a railroad for the benefit of the public. And yet, we are told, that all such
exclusive

grants are to the detriment of the public. * * *

I go further, and maintain, not only that it is not a case
for strict construction; but that the charter, upon its very face, by its
terms, and for its

professed objects, demands from the court, upon undeniable
principles of law, a favorable construction for the grantees. * * * [T]hey are
to take

upon themselves the chances of success; and if the
enterprise fails, the loss is exclusively their own. Nor let any man imagine,
that there was not,

at the time when this charter was granted, much solid ground
for doubting success. In order to entertain a just view of this subject, we
must go

back to that period of general bankruptcy, and distress and
difficulty. The constitution of the United States was not only

#1116

not then in existence, but it was not then even dreamed of.
The union of the states was crumbling into ruins, under the old confederation.

Agriculture, manufactures and commerce were at their lowest
ebb. There was infinite danger to all the states, from local interests and
jealousies,

and from the apparent impossibility of a much longer
adherence to that shadow of a government, the continental congress. And even
four years

afterwards, when every evil had been greatly aggravated, and
civil war was added to other calamities, the constitution of the United States
was

all but shipwrecked, in passing through the state
conventions; it was adopted by very slender majorities. These are historical
facts, which

required no coloring to give them effect, and admitted of no
concealment, to seduce men into schemes of future aggrandizement. I would even

now put it to the common sense of every man, whether, if the
constitution of the United States had not been adopted, the charter would have
been

worth a forty years’ purchase of the tolls.

This is not all. It is well known, historically, that this
was the very first bridge ever constructed, in New England, over navigable
tide-waters

so near the sea. The rigors of our climate, the dangers from
sudden thaws and freezing, and the obstructions from ice in a rapid current,
were

deemed by many persons to be insuperable obstacles to the
success of such a project. It was believed, that the bridge would scarcely
stand a

single severe winter. And I myself am old enough to know,
that in regard to other arms of the sea, at much later periods, the same doubts
have

had a strong and depressing influence upon public
enterprises. If Charles River bridge had been carried away, during the first or
second season

after its erection, it is far from being certain, that up to
this moment, another bridge, upon such an arm of the sea, would ever have been
erected

in Massachusetts. I state these things, which are of public
notoriety, to repel the notion that the legislature was surprised into an
incautious grant,

or that the reward was more than adequate to the perils.
There was a full and adequate consideration, in a pecuniary sense, for the
charter. But, in

a more general sense, the erection of the bridge, as a
matter of accommodation, has been incalculably beneficial to the public.
Unless, therefore,

we are wholly to disregard the declarations of the
legislature, and the objects of the charter, and the historical facts of the
times; and indulge in

mere private speculations of profit and loss, by our present
lights and experience; it seems to me, that the court is bound to come to the

interpretation of this charter, with a persuasion that it
was granted in furtherance, and not in derogation, of the public good. * * *

The argument of the defendants is, that the plaintiffs are
to take nothing by implication. Either (say they) the exclusive grant extends
only to

the local limits of the bridge; or it extends the whole
length of the river, or, at least, up to old Cambridge bridge. The latter
construction would be

absurd and monstrous; and therefore, the former must be the
true one. Now, I utterly deny the alternative involved in the dilemma. The
right to

#1117

build a bridge over a river, and to take toll, may well
include an exclusive franchise, beyond the local limits of the bridge; and yet
not extend

through the whole course of the river, or even to any
considerable distance on the river. There is no difficulty, in common sense, or
in law, in

maintaining such a doctrine. But then, it is asked, what
limits can be assigned to such a franchise? The answer is obvious; the grant
carries with it

an exclusive franchise, to a reasonable distance on the
river; so that the ordinary travel to the bridge shall not be diverted by any
new bridge, to

the injury or ruin of the franchise. A new bridge, which
would be a nuisance to the old bridge, would be within the reach of its
exclusive right.

The question would not be so much as to the fact of
distance, as it would be as to the fact of nuisance. There is nothing new in
such expositions

of incorporeal rights; and nothing new in thus
administering, upon this foundation, remedies in regard thereto. The doctrine
is coeval with the

common law itself. Suppose, an action is brought for
shutting up the ancient lights belonging to a messuage; or for diverting a
water-course; or

for flowing back a stream; or for erecting a nuisance near a
dwelling-house; the question in such cases is not one of mere distance; of mere
feet

and inches, but of injury—permanent, real and substantial
injury—to be decided upon all the circumstances of the case. * * *

Let us see what is the result of the narrow construction
contended for by the defendants. * * * Now, I put it to the common sense of
every

man, whether if, at the moment of granting the charter, the
legislature had said to the proprietors; you shall build the bridge; you shall
bear the

burdens; you shall be bound by the charges; and your sole
reimbursement shall be from the tolls of forty years: and yet we will not even
guaranty

you any certainty of receiving any tolls; on the contrary;
we reserve to ourselves the full power and authority to erect other bridges,
toll or free

bridges, according to our own free will and pleasure,
contiguous to yours, and having the same termini with yours; and if you are
successful, we

may thus supplant you, divide, destroy your profits, and
annihilate your tolls, without annihilating your burdens: if, I say, such had
been the

language of the legislature, is there a man living, of
ordinary discretion or prudence, who would have accepted such a charter, upon
such terms? I

fearlessly answer, no. There would have been such a gross
inadequacy of consideration, and such a total insecurity of all the rights of
property,

under such circumstances, that the project would have
dropped still-born. And I put the question further, whether any legislature,
meaning to

promote a project of permanent, public utility (such as this
confessedly was), would ever have dreamed of such a qualification of its own
grant,

when it sought to enlist private capital and private
patronage to insure the accomplishment of it? * * *

[I]t is conceded, that the legislature cannot revoke or
resume this grant. Why not, I pray to know? There is no negative covenant in
the

charter; there is no express prohibition to be found there.
The reason is plain. The prohibition arises by natural, if not by necessary,
implication.

#1118

It would be against the first principles of justice, to
presume that the legislature reserved a right to destroy its own grant. That
was the doctrine in

Fletcher v. Peck , 10 U.S. ( 6 Cranch) 87 (1810), in this
court; and in other cases turning upon the same great principle of political
and

constitutional duty and right. Can the legislature have
power to do that indirectly, which it cannot do directly? If it cannot take
away, or resume,

the franchise itself, can it take away its whole substance
and value? If the law will create an implication, that the legislature shall
not resume its

own grant, is it not equally as natural and as necessary an
implication, that the legislature shall not do any act directly to prejudice
its own grant,

or to destroy its value? * * *

It is upon this ground, and this ground only, that we can
explain the established doctrine in relation to ferries. When the crown grants
a ferry

from A. to B., without using any words which import it to be
an exclusive ferry, why is it (as will be presently shown), that by the common
law,

the grant is construed to be exclusive of all other ferries
between the same places or termini; at least, if such ferries are so near that
they are

injurious to the first ferry, and tend to a direct
diminution of its receipts? Plainly, it must be, because from the nature of
such a franchise, it can

have no permanent value, unless it is exclusive; and the
circumstance that during the existence of the grant, the grantee has public
burdens

imposed upon him, raises the implication, that nothing shall
be done to the prejudice of it, while it is a subsisting franchise. * * *

In the case of a ferry, there is a public charge and duty.
The owner must keep the ferry in good repair, upon the peril of an indictment.
He

must keep sufficient accommodations for all travellers, at
all reasonable times. He must content himself with a reasonable toll. Such is
the jus

publicum. In return, the law will exclude all injurious
competition, and deem every new ferry a nuisance, which subtracts from him the
ordinary

custom and toll. * * * The same principle applies, without a
shadow of difference that I am able to perceive, to the case of a bridge; for
the duties

are publici juris , and pontage and passage are but
different names for exclusive toll for transportation. * * *

Wherever any other bridge or ferry is so near, that it
injures the franchise, or diminishes the toll, in a positive and essential
decree, there it is

a nuisance, and is actionable. It invades the franchise, and
ought to be abated. But whether there be such an injury or not, is a matter,
not of law,

but of fact. Distance is no otherwise important than as it
bears on the question of fact. All that is required, is, that there should be a
sensible,

positive injury. In the present case, there is no room to
doubt upon this point, for the bridges are contiguous; and Warren bridge, after
it was

opened, took away three-fourths of the profits of the travel
from Charles River bridge; and when it became free (as it now is), it
necessarily took

away all the tolls, or all except an unimportant and trivial
amount. * * *

#1119

But it is said, if this is the law, what then is to become
of turnpikes and canals? Is the legislature precluded from authorizing new
turnpikes

or new canals, simply because they cross the path of the old
ones, and incidentally diminish their receipt of tolls? The answer is plain.
Every

turnpike has its local limits and local termini; its points
of beginning and of end. No one ever imagined, that the legislature might grant
a new

turnpike, with exactly the same location and termini. That
would be to rescind its first grant. The grant of a turnpike between A. and B.,
does not

preclude the legislature from the grant of a turnpike
between A. and C., even though it should incidentally intercept some of the
travel; for it is

not necessarily a nuisance to the former grant. The termini
being different, the grants are or may be substantially different. But if the
legislature

should grant a second turnpike, substantially taking away
the whole travel from the first turnpike, between the same local points; then,
I say, it is

a violation of the rights of the first turnpike. * * *

But then again, it is said, that all this rests upon
implication, and not upon the words of the charter. I admit, that it does; but
I again say, that

the implication is natural and necessary. It is
indispensable to the proper effect of the grant. The franchise cannot subsist
without it, at least, for

any valuable or practical purpose. What objection can there
be to implications, if they arise from the very nature and objects of the
grant? If it be

indispensable to the full enjoyment of the right to take
toll, that it should be exclusive within certain limits, is it not just and
reasonable, that it

should be so construed? * * *

To the answer already given to the objection, that, unless
such a reservation of power exists, there will be a stop put to the progress of
all

public improvements; I wish, in this connection, to add,
that there never can any such consequence follow upon the opposite doctrine. If
the

public exigencies and interests require that the franchise
of Charles River bridge should be taken away, or impaired, it may be lawfully
done,

upon making due compensation to the proprietors. “Whenever,”
says the constitution of Massachusetts, “the public exigencies require that the

property of any individual should be appropriated to public
uses, he shall receive a reasonable compensation therefor;” and this franchise
is

property—is fixed determinate property. * * *

But it is said, that if the doctrine contended for be not
true, then every grant to a corporation becomes, ipso facto , a monopoly or
exclusive

privilege. The grant of a bank, or of an insurance company,
or of a manufacturing company, becomes a monopoly, and excludes all injurious

competition. With the greatest deference and respect for
those who press such an argument, I cannot but express my surprise that it
should be

urged. * * * [I]n cases of ferries and bridges, and other
franchises of a like nature (as has been shown), they are affected with a jus
publicum.

Such grants are made for the public accommodation; and
pontage and passage are authorized to be levied upon travellers (which can only
be by

public authority); and in return, the proprietors are bound
to keep up all

#1120

suitable accommodations for travellers, under the penalty of
indictment for their neglect. * * *

It has been further argued, that even if the charter of the
Charles River bridge does imply such a contract on the part of the legislature,
as is

contended for, it is void for want of authority in the
legislature to make it * * *. But let us see what the argument is, in relation
to sovereignty in

general. It admits, that the sovereign power has, among its
prerogatives, the right to make grants, to build bridges, to erect ferries, to
lay out

highways; and to create franchises for public and private
purposes. If it has a right to make such grants, it follows, that the grantees
have a right

to take, and to hold, these franchises. It would be a
solecism, to declare that the sovereign power could grant, and yet no one could
have a right to

take. * * *

It follows, from this view of the subject, that if the
sovereign power grants any franchise, it is good and irrevocable, within the
limits

granted, whatever they may be; or else, in every case, the
grant will be held only during pleasure; and the identical franchise may be
granted to

any other person, or may be revoked at the will of the
sovereign. This latter doctrine is not pretended; and, indeed, is
unmaintainable in our

systems of free government. * * * Thus, for example, if the
sovereign power should expressly grant an exclusive right to build a bridge
over

navigable waters, between the towns of A. and B., and should
expressly contract with the grantees, that no other bridge should be built
between

the same towns; the grant would, upon the principles of the
argument, be equally void in regard to the franchise, within the planks of the
bridge,

as it would be in regard to the franchise, outside of the
planks of the bridge; for, in each case, it would, pro tanto , abridge or
surrender the right of

the sovereign to grant a new bridge within the local limits.
I am aware, that the argument is not pressed to this extent; but it seems to me
a

necessary consequence flowing from it. The grant of the
franchise of a bridge, twenty feet wide, to be exclusive within those limits,
is certainly,

if obligatory, an abridgment or surrender of the sovereign
power to grant another bridge within the same limits; if we mean to say, that
every

grant that diminishes the things upon which that power can
rightfully act, is such an abridgment. Yet the argument admits, that within the
limits

and planks of the bridge itself, the grant is exclusive; and
cannot be recalled. There is no doubt, that there is a necessary exception in
every such

grant, that if it is wanted for public use, it may be taken
by the sovereign power for such use, upon making compensation. Such a taking is
not a

violation of the contract; but it is strictly an exception,
resulting from the nature and attributes of sovereignty; implied from the very
terms, or at

least, acting upon the subject-matter of the grant, suo
jure. * * *

Upon the whole, my judgment is, that the act of the
legislature of Massachusetts granting the charter of Warren Bridge, is an act
impairing

the obligation of the prior contract and grant to the
proprietors of Charles River bridge; and, by the constitution of the United
States, it

#1121

is, therefore, utterly void. I am for reversing the decree
to the state court (dismissing the bill); and for remanding the cause to the
state court for

further proceedings, as to law and justice shall appertain.

JUSTICE THOMPSON. [omitted]

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .For background on the case, see Stanley I. Kutler,
Privilege and Creative Destruction: The Charles River Bridge Case ( 1971 );
Charles Warren,

The Charles River Bridge Case, 3 Green Bag 2 d 78 ( 1999 ).
Tolls on the Charles River Bridge were fixed by its legislative charter of 1785
and were

never adjusted. Once the original construction costs were
paid off, routine operating expenses were relatively low. As population and
commercial

activity surged in the Boston area following the adoption of
the Constitution, the bridge was soon generating enormous profits; shares in
the corporation

eventually increased to over 300 % of their original value.
The perception that the bridge shareholders were making handsome profits
contributed to

agitation for construction of a new “free” bridge and may
also help account for the relatively unsympathetic attitude of the judiciary
toward the claims of

the Charles River Bridge proprietors. Kutler reports that as
long as the Warren Bridge was charging tolls up through the early 1830 s, the
Charles River

Bridge managed to remain profitable, although at a
much-reduced level. Once the Warren Bridge stopped charging tolls, in 1836 ,
the Charles River

Bridge could no longer cover its operating costs and
defaulted on the £ 200 annuity to Harvard (then worth $ 666 ). After the
Supreme Court decision, the

proprietors of the Charles River Bridge sold their franchise
to the state for a mere $ 25 , 000. In 1847 , the state eventually granted
Harvard $ 3 , 333 in

recognition of its lost annuities; this was the last revenue
Harvard would see from its ferry monopoly. Ironically, both the buyout of the
Charles River

Bridge and the payment to Harvard were funded out of renewed
tolls imposed by the state on both bridges.

2 .Is it a fair inference from the facts of _Charles River
Bridge_ that the Massachusetts legislature chartered the Warren Bridge
precisely for the

purpose of putting the Charles River bridge out of business?
In other words, that the motive of the legislature was to expropriate the
investment of the

shareholders of the Charles River Bridge Company? If so,
this would sharply distinguish the legislative action here from other types of
governmental

actions that inadvertently disadvantage existing
enterprises. For example, a government decision to start chartering railroads
might put turnpike roads or

river barges out of business, even if the railroad does not
operate along a directly parallel line. But is it possible for a court to
distinguish among

different types of governmental actions based on the
motivations of the legislature? What if the motivations are mixed or ambiguous?
Would it be

unseemly or perhaps even violate principles of separation of
powers for courts to take evidence on or speculate about the motivations of the
legislature?

On the other hand, is it possible for judges not to be
influenced by inferences of legislative motivation in passing on the
constitutionality of laws that are

enacted?

3 .Corporate charters and franchises were often viewed in
the nineteenth century as a type of special privilege or monopoly that served
to enrich a

well-connected rentier class at the expense of the common
people. The Second Bank of the United States, which Taney, serving as Attorney
General,

had shut down on orders from President Jackson, was a great
symbol for those holding this political perspective. _Charles River Bridge_ was
also a contest

over political symbols—the Proprietors of the Warren Bridge
represented the anti-monopoly, anti-privilege views of the Jacksonian
Democrats, whereas

the Proprietors of the Charles River Bridge represented the
pro-property rights, pro-internal improvement ideology of the Whigs like Joseph
Story and

Daniel Webster (who argued the cause for the Proprietors of
the Charles River Bridge).

4 .The principal case involves a corporate charter or
franchise, which all Justices agreed should be considered a constitutionally
protected right.

But the doctrine of strict construction has also been
applied to government grants of more conventional property rights. For example,
in Watt v. Western

Nuclear, Inc., 462 U.S. 36 ( 1983 ), certain Homesteading
Acts granting land to settlers had reserved to the government “all the coal and
other minerals”

in those lands. The question was whether the reservation of
“other minerals” included gravel. The Court held that the gravel belonged to
the United

States, relying in part on “the established rule that land
grants are construed favorably to the Government, that nothing passes except
what is conveyed

in clear language, and that if there are doubts they are
resolved for the Government, not against it.” Id. (quoting United States v.
Union Pac. R.R. Co.,

353 U.S. 112 , 116 ( 1957 )). (Recall also that the public
trust doctrine, discussed in Chapter III, sometimes functions as a rule of
construction protecting

public rights against alienation.) Do you agree that the
same considerations cited by Chief Justice Taney for construing corporate
charters favorably to

the government also require that courts construe land grants
to settlers favorably to the government? For example, do considerations about
the need to

facilitate the development of new technology and prevent
monopoly apply with the same force to grants of land to homesteaders? Another
problem here

is that the incidents associated with conventional grants of
property like land are typically not spelled out in the grant, but are defined
by common law

(although in _Western Nuclear_ the reservation was written
in the grant, albeit in ambiguous terms). How, if at all, does one apply the
doctrine of strict

construction to property rights, the incidents of which are
defined by common law?

5 .Is Taney’s proposed accommodation between change and
reliance only a temporary one? In effect, the principle of strict construction
is just a

default rule, around which future charter promoters and
legislatures are free to contract. If the response to the decision is simply to
require that all

charters be made explicitly exclusive, as Story suggests it
will be, then what exactly has been accomplished by the holding in the case?
Will the new

generation of charters at least be clearer and less subject
to disputes and litigation? In _Bridge Proprietors v. Hoboken Co._ , 68 U.S. (
1 Wall.) 116 ( 1863 ),

the Court considered a 99 - year charter that expressly
barred “any other bridge” from being built near the plaintiff’s bridge. The
Court held that the

```



1123



```

charter was not impaired when the state permitted a railroad
bridge to be constructed nearby, because the word “bridge” did not clearly
encompass a

railroad bridge.

6 .Taney and Story are acutely aware of the technological
dynamism of the American economy, discussing how ferries have been superseded
by

bridges and turnpikes by railroads. When an old-technology
enterprise that enjoys some kind of government charter is being displaced by a
new-

technology enterprise that also enjoys some kind of
government support, how does one distinguish between the impact of a change in
government policy

and a change in technology? In _Market Street Ry. Co. v.
Railroad Comm’n_ , 324 U.S. 548 ( 1945 ), the Court was faced with the claim by
a street railway

company that a state regulatory commission was driving it
out of business. But the Court concluded that the real problem was competition
from new

technology, in the form of bus companies. Today, local
wire-line telephone companies have lost market share to wireless and
internet-based

communication technologies. Their loss of business is partly
due to government policy and partly due to new technology. How can courts
disentangle

these causes?

7 .One modern analogue of the dispute in _Charles River
Bridge_ is provided by controversies over what have been called “deregulatory
takings.”

Traditionally, public utility services like electric, gas,
water, and local telephone service were thought to be natural monopolies, and
so only one firm

was given a franchise to serve any given area. Advances in
technology and new thinking about the best method of utility regulation have
led to attempts

to introduce competition into these industries (with mixed
success). When the government sets policy to deliberately inject competition
into a market

that has previously been served by a monopoly, does the
incumbent monopolist have a right to block the change or demand compensation
for lost

revenues? Should it matter if the utility franchise
explicitly confers monopoly privileges on the incumbent carrier (most do not)?
For a variety of

perspectives on this problem, see J. Gregory Sidak &
Daniel F. Spulber, Deregulatory Takings and the Regulatory Contract ( 1997 );
William J. Baumol

& Thomas W. Merrill, Deregulatory Takings, Breach of the
Regulatory Contract, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 , 72 N.Y.U. L. Rev.
1037

( 1997 ); Susan Rose-Ackerman & Jim Rossi, Disentangling
Deregulatory Takings, 86 Va. L. Rev. 1435 ( 2000 ); Jim Chen, The Death of the
Regulatory

Compact: Adjusting Prices and Expectations in the Law of
Regulated Industries, 67 Ohio St. L.J. 1265 , 1295 – 1304 ( 2006 ).

8 .Another modern analogue is the debate over the welfare
effects of granting monopolies to holders of intellectual property rights such
as patents

and copyrights. Compare Michele Boldrin & David K.
Levine, Against Intellectual Monopoly ( 2008 ); Mark A. Lemley & Mark P.
McKenna, Is Pepsi

Really a Substitute for Coke? Market Definition in Antitrust
and IP, 100 Geo. L.J. 2055 ( 2012 ) with Jonathan Barnett, Patent Groupthink
Unravels, 34

Harv. J.L. & Tech. 419 ( 2021 ); Edmund W. Kitch,
Elementary and Persistent Errors in the Economic Analysis of Intellectual
Property, 53 Vand. L. Rev.

1727 ( 2000 ). As Eric Posner and Glen Weyl point out, all
property rights, i.e. rights to exclude others from particular resources,
create a

```



1124



```

monopoly with respect to the particular resource in
question. Eric A. Posner & E. Glen Weyl, Radical Markets: Uprooting
Capitalism and Democracy

for a Just Society ( 2018 ). But the welfare effect of
exclusion rights depends significantly on whether there are reasonable
substitutes for the monopoly in

question. If A owns a car, and does not want to sell it to
B, the welfare effect on B depends on whether someone else has a similar car
they are willing to

sell to B on reasonable terms. If there are good
substitutes, the monopoly right associated with property does not pose large
adverse effects on social

welfare. If there are no good substitutes, some form of
public intervention, in the form of antitrust law, regulation of terms of
service and pricing, or

compulsory licensing, may be appropriate.

Forbearance Values

The dueling opinions in Charles River Bridge emphasize
different values in trying to determine how strictly the government should be

required to forbear from interfering with existing rights.
Chief Justice Taney underlines the importance of accommodating change, so as to

promote competition, encourage the development of new
technologies like railroads, and free the present generation from the dead hand
of old

monopolies. Justice Story stresses the importance of
protecting reliance interests, in order to encourage investors to put capital
at risk in new

projects. Both sets of values are still regarded today as
being important in determining the optimal level of government forbearance. But
there are

other values to consider as well.

Chief Justice Taney emphasizes how over-protecting existing
interests can stultify economic growth by stifling competition. Today,

commentators would probably also consider distributive
justice as a factor that might warrant government modification of property
rights.

Suppose, for example, that we conclude the extension of
existing intellectual property rights confers a windfall on a lucky few at the
expense of

higher license costs and transaction costs for the many.
Should the government be allowed to rescind the legislation on the ground that
the

extension was distributively unjust? One general question
here is how often it is necessary to interfere with specific property rights on

distributive justice grounds, given the option of imposing
progressive taxes which can be paid from a variety of sources. Expropriation or

abolition of rights in specific property is deeply
unsettling to owners and very likely discourages future investment. Ratcheting
up tax rates,

particularly when the increases apply only in future years,
is arguably a less disruptive and more effective mechanism for achieving
greater

distributional equity. The contending positions are set
forth in Louis Kaplow & Steven Shavell, Why the Legal System Is Less
Efficient than the

Income Tax in Redistributing Income, 23 J. Legal Stud. 667
(1994); Louis Kaplow & Steven Shavell, Should Legal Rules Favor the Poor?

Clarifying the Role of Legal Rules and the Income Tax in
Redistributing Income, 29 J. Legal Stud. 821 (2000); Ronen Avraham, David
Fortus, &

Kyle Logue, Revisiting the Roles of Legal Rules and Tax

#1125

Rules in Income Redistribution: A Response to Kaplow &
Shavell, 89 Iowa L. Rev. 1125 (2004). Still, there may be circumstances where

interfering with specific property rights or expectations is
the only course available to achieving what is regarded as a more just
distribution of

wealth. See Lee Anne Fennell & Richard H. McAdams, The
Distributive Deficit in Law and Economics, 100 Minn. L. Rev. 1051 (2016);

Rule Design Should Incorporate Equity as Well as Efficiency, 123 Yale L.J. 2478

(2014).

Justice Story also invokes economic growth, but he takes the
perspective of those who have investment capital available for new

undertakings. Is Justice Story’s concern about protecting
reliance interests focused on the level of return to investments or on
uncertainty

regarding the level of return to investments? Both are
obviously relevant to any entrepreneur thinking about making an investment in a
new

enterprise. But there is reason to think that uncertainty is
a particular concern where government forbearance is at issue. If the
government

engages in random acts of expropriation, this may not change
the expected level of return for other investments very much (on an ex ante
basis).

But it is likely to raise grave concerns about the future
course of government behavior and may have a disproportionate impact on
discouraging

new investment. (We consider at the end of Part B whether
private insurance may be a solution to the problem of uncertainty about
government

behavior and policy.) Today, commentators would probably
also emphasize another factor: A weak commitment on the part of government to

forbear from interfering with property may encourage some
people to spend time and money on efforts to secure legislation interfering
with other

people’s property and may in turn cause other people to
spend time and money to head off such legislation in order to protect their
property from

interference. Economists often refer to this kind of
jockeying for government favor as “rent-seeking,” with the implication that
this kind of

competition is a dead-weight loss to society. The issue is
extremely complicated, however, as sometimes competition for the recognition or

modification of property rights can lead to policy changes
that benefit society. Determining the optimal level of political agitation for
change in

policy regarding property is therefore an almost impossible
task, although it may be possible to identify some measures—like laws that
seize A’s

property and transfer it to B without any change in the
anticipated use of the resources—as being presumptively unjustified.

What we are calling forbearance can be seen as an aspect of
the rule of law. Lon Fuller set out a famous list of criteria for the rule of
law,

including generality, clarity, non-contradiction, constancy,
and non-retroactivity. See Lon L. Fuller, The Morality of Law 33–91 (2d ed.
1969).

How are these criteria related to forbearance? Notice that
these criteria are very similar to the possible advantages of legislatures over
courts in

#1126

altering the menu of property rights—the numerus clausus as
a principle of institutional choice. Thomas W. Merrill & Henry E. Smith,
Optimal

Standardization in the Law of Property: The Numerus Clausus
Principle, 110 Yale L.J. 1, 58–68 (2000). Would that choice be less plausible
in

the absence of the devices explored in this Chapter? There
are many versions of the rule of law, and how to promote the rule of law—and
what

exactly to promote—have been controversial topics in law and
development. See Private Law and the Rule of Law (Lisa M. Austin & Dennis

Klimchuk eds., 2014); Brian Z. Tamanaha, On the Rule of Law:
History, Politics, Theory (2004).

Recently, a number of scholars have attempted to determine
empirically what kind of impact government forbearance has on the general

level of economic activity in different countries. See,
e.g., Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson & James Robinson, The Colonial Origins
of

Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation, 91 Am.
Econ. Rev. 1369 (2001); Kevin E. Davis & Michael J. Trebilcock, The

Relationship Between Law and Development: Optimists and
Skeptics, 56 Am. J. Comp. L. 895 (2008); Simon Johnson, John McMillan &

Christopher Woodruff, Property Rights and Finance, 92 Am.
Econ. Rev. 1335 (2002); Terra Lawson-Remer, Property Insecurity, 38 Brooklyn J.

Int’l L. 145 (2012); Paul G. Mahoney, The Common Law and
Economic Growth: Hayek Might Be Right, 30 J. Legal Stud. 503 (2001). These

studies adopt a variety of measures of forbearance, although
government commitment to pay just compensation when property is taken is one

common yardstick. Whatever measures are used, virtually all
these studies find a positive correlation between what we are calling
forbearance

and rates of aggregate economic growth. In any event, the
law and development literature provides at least some empirical support for
Justice

Story’s concerns, if not for his particular application of
those concerns in Charles River Bridge.

Legislative Entrenchment

Another way to consider the problem in Charles River Bridge
is to ask: To what extent should one legislature be able to tie the hands of a

subsequent legislature? We live in a democracy, and a
central tenet of democracy is majority rule. Ordinarily, majority rule is
understood to mean

rule by the current majority. Thus, if last year’s
duly-elected legislature enacts a particular measure, such as “no vehicles in
the park,” it is

understood that this year’s duly-elected legislature can
adopt a different measure, such as “vehicles in the park are okay.” We might
think it

incompatible with democracy for last year’s legislature to
enact a statute that says: “No vehicles in the park, and this rule cannot be
repealed.” If

such a statute were enforced to block today’s legislature
from repealing the rule against vehicles in the park, this would seem like a
type of dead

hand control: A previous legislature, elected by a previous
majority, is overriding the preferences of today’s legislature, elected by

#1127

today’s majority, in violation of the general principle of
majority rule. Commentators have taken a variety of positions on whether
legislative

entrenchment is permissible or desirable. For further
discussion, see David Dana & Susan P. Koniak, Bargaining in the Shadow of
Democracy,

148 U. Pa. L. Rev. 473 (1999); Julian Eule, Temporal Limits
on the Legislative Mandate: Entrenchment and Retroactivity, 1987 Am. B. Found.

Res. J. 379 ; Michael J. Klarman, Majoritarian Judicial
Review: The Entrenchment Problem, 85 Geo. L.J. 491 (1997); John O. McGinnis
&

Michael B. Rappaport, Symmetric Entrenchment: A
Constitutional and Normative Theory, 89 Va. L. Rev. 385 (2003); Eric A. Posner
& Adrian

Vermeule, Legislative Entrenchment: A Reappraisal, 111 Yale
L.J. 1665 (2002); John C. Roberts & Erwin Chemerinsky, Entrenchment of

Ordinary Legislation: A Reply to Professors Posner and
Vermeule, 91 Cal. L. Rev. 1773 (2003); Stewart E. Sterk, Retrenchment on

Entrenchment, 71 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 231 (2003).

The proposition that government should be required to
forbear from interfering with property presupposes that at least some
legislative

entrenchment is permissible. In particular, the hands of
future legislatures must be tied insofar as they seek to repudiate promises,
express or

implied, to forbear from interfering with property rights.
But while modern commentators often embrace extreme positions (never entrench,

entrench whenever you like), notice that both Chief Justice
Taney and Justice Story adopt more nuanced views. Justice Taney is relatively
hostile

to legislative entrenchment, but even he believes that an
express promise by the legislature to make a charter exclusive would be binding
on a

successor legislature and would be enforced under the
Contracts Clause. Justice Story is more sympathetic to entrenchment, but even
he

acknowledges that a future legislature can get rid of a
corporate charter using the power of eminent domain. So it is likely that in
practice the

legal system will take up a position between the polar
extremes staked out by the commentators. The critical issues are what sort of
doctrines will

be used to impose a limited degree of entrenchment, and what
kinds of circumstances will justify departures from entrenchment.

### B. OTHER SOURCES OF GOVERNMENT FORBEARANCE

The Contracts Clause, U.S. Const. art. I § 10, which
prohibits states from enacting laws “impairing the obligation of contract,” is

encountered less frequently today than it was when the
Supreme Court decided Charles River Bridge. But there are multiple sources of
constraint

on governments that can act as a brake on actions that upset
expectations associated with property. In this Part we consider briefly
constraints

associated with procedural due process, the doctrine of
vested rights (and the associated canon of interpretation disfavoring
retroactive laws), the

strong version of stare decisis associated with property
rights, and international investment treaties, which typically include
provisions

#1128

protecting investors against certain types of government
interference with investment property.

### 1 .DUE PROCESS

The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution provides that no
person shall “be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of

law.” U.S. Const. amend V. This language binds the federal
government. In 1868 the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, extending the same

language to state governments (and local governmental
authorities that derive their powers from the states). U.S. Const. amend. XIV.

Commentators and (some) judges have pointed out that “due
process of law” sounds like a requirement of procedural regularity. See, e.g.,
Frank

H. Easterbrook, Substance and Due Process, 1982 Sup. Ct.
Rev. 85. Nevertheless, “due process of law” has long been understood as
providing

both procedural and substantive protection for property
rights. The substantive protections include a requirement that courts give
extra scrutiny to

retroactive legislation affecting property, see, e.g., Usery
v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1, 16–18 (1976), and protections against

excessive penalties and civil damages awards, see, e.g., BMW
of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (1996). The core procedural

protections are a requirement of notice and an opportunity
to contest the legality of government deprivations of property before they
occur. See,

e.g., Jones v. Flowers, 547 U.S. 220 (2006) (state must take
measures reasonably designed to provide notice to owner before seizing home for

nonpayment of taxes); United States v. James Daniel Good
Real Property, 510 U.S. 43 (1993) (state must afford owner an opportunity to
contest

legality of forfeiture proceeding before seizing property).

Somewhat surprisingly, however, it was not until the 1970s
that the Supreme Court began to attend to the question of what sorts of
interests

are encompassed within the term “property” in the Due
Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The decision that
brought the

question to the fore was Goldberg v. Kelly , 397 U.S. 254
(1970), where the Court—without explicitly so deciding—assumed that the right
to

receive future welfare benefits was a form of “property”
protected by procedural due process. Goldberg cited favorably to the work of
Yale Law

School professor Charles Reich. See id. at 262 n.8 (citing
Charles Reich, Individual Rights and Social Welfare: The Emerging Legal Issues,
74

Yale L.J. 1245 (1965) and Charles Reich, The New Property,
73 Yale L.J. 733 (1964)). Reich’s visionary scholarship did not focus on the

question how the word “property” should be defined for
conventional legal purposes, including implementation of the due process
clauses. He

offered a much more far-reaching thesis about the function
of property in a world in which government plays a larger role in everyday life
than

had been the case before the advent of the modern
administrative state. In the modern world of the activist state, Reich argued,
it is imperative

radically to expand the concept of property in order to
protect individuals

#1129

against majoritarian tyranny. A brief excerpt from his
leading article advancing this thesis follows.

```

The institution called property guards the troubled boundary
between individual man and the state. It is not the only guardian; many other

institutions, laws, and practices serve as well. But in a
society that chiefly values material well-being, the power to control a
particular portion of

that well-being is the very foundation of individuality.

One of the most important developments in the United States
during the past decade has been the emergence of government as a major

source of wealth. Government is a gigantic syphon. It draws
in revenue and power, and pours forth wealth: money, benefits, services,
contracts,

franchises, and licenses. Government has always had this
function. But while in early times it was minor, today’s distribution of
largess is on a

vast, imperial scale.

The valuables dispensed by government take many forms, but
they all share one characteristic. They are steadily taking the place of

traditional forms of wealth—forms which are held as private
property. Social insurance substitutes for savings; a government contract
replaces a

businessman’s customers and goodwill. The wealth of more and
more Americans depends upon a relationship to government. Increasingly,

Americans live on government largess—allocated by government
on its own terms, and held by recipients subject to conditions which express

“the public interest.”

The growth of government largess, accompanied by a
distinctive system of law, is having profound consequences. It affects the

underpinnings of individualism and independence. It
influences the workings of the Bill of Rights. It has an impact on the power of
private

interests, in their relation to each other and to
government. It is helping to create a new society. * * *

The characteristics of the public interest state are varied,
but there is an underlying philosophy that unites them. This is the doctrine
that the

wealth that flows from government is held by its recipients
conditionally, subject to confiscation in the interest of the paramount state.
This

philosophy is epitomized in the most important of all
judicial decisions concerning government largess, the case of Flemming v.
Nestor.^175

Ephram Nestor, an alien, came to this country in 1913, and
after a long working life became eligible in 1955 for old-age benefits under
the

Social Security Act. From 1936 to 1955 Nestor and his
employers had contributed payments to the government which went into a special
old-

#1130

age and survivors insurance trust fund. From 1933 to 1939
Nestor was a member of the Communist Party. Long after his membership ceased,

Congress passed a law retroactively making such membership
cause for deportation, and a second law, also retroactive, making such
deportation

for having been a member of the Party grounds for loss of
retirement benefits. In 1956 Nestor was deported, leaving his wife here. Soon
after his

deportation, payment of benefits to Nestor’s wife was
terminated.

In a five to four decision, the Supreme Court held that
cutting off Nestor’s retirement insurance, although based on conduct completely

lawful at the time, was not unconstitutional. Specifically,
it was not a taking of property without due process of law; Nestor’s benefits
were not

an “accrued property right.”^176 The Court recognized that
each worker’s benefits flow “from the contributions he made to the national
economy

while actively employed,” but it held that his interest is
“noncontractual” and “cannot be soundly analogized to that of the holder of an

annuity.”^177 The Court continued:

To engraft upon the Social Security system a concept of
“accrued property rights” would deprive it of the flexibility and boldness in

adjustment of ever-changing conditions which it demands...
It was doubtless out of an awareness of the need for such flexibility that

Congress included... a clause expressly reserving to it
“[t]he right to alter, amend or repeal any provision” of the Act.... That

provision makes express what is implicit in the
institutional needs of the program.^178

The Court stated further that, in any case where Congress
“modified” social security rights, the Court should interfere only if the
action is

“utterly lacking in rational justification.”^179 This, the
Court said, “is not the case here.” As the Court saw it, it might be deemed
reasonable for

Congress to limit payments to those living in this country;
moreover, the Court thought it would not have been “irrational for Congress to
have

concluded that the public purse should not be utilized to
contribute to the support of those deported on the grounds specified in the
statute.”^180

The implications of Flemming v. Nestor are profound. No form
of government largess is more personal or individual than an old age

pension. No form is more clearly earned by the recipient,
who, together with his employer, contributes to the Social Security fund during
the

years of his employment. No form is more obviously a
compulsory substitute for private property; the tax on wage earner and employer
might

readily have gone to higher pay and higher private savings
instead. No form is more relied on, and more often thought of as property. No
form is

more vital to the independence and dignity of the
individual.

#1131

Yet under the philosophy of Congress and the Court, a man or
woman, after a lifetime of work, has no rights which may not be taken away to

serve some public policy. The Court makes no effort to
balance the interests at stake. The public policy that justifies cutting off
benefits need not

even be an important one or a wise one—so long as it is not
utterly irrational, the Court will not interfere. In any clash between
individual rights

and public policy, the latter is automatically held to be
superior.

The philosophy of Flemming v. Nestor * * * resembles the
philosophy of feudal tenure. Wealth is not “owned,” or “vested” in the holders.

Instead, it is held conditionally, the conditions being ones
which seek to ensure the fulfillment of obligations imposed by the state. Just
as the

feudal system linked lord and vassal through a system of
mutual dependence, obligation, and loyalty, so government largess binds man to
the

state. And, it may be added, loyalty or fealty to the state
is often one of the essential conditions of modem tenure. In the many decisions
taking

away government largess for refusal to sign loyalty oaths,
belonging to “subversive” organizations, or other similar grounds, there is
more than a

suggestion of the condition of fealty demanded in older
times. * * *

Property is a legal institution the essence of which is the
creation and protection of certain private rights in wealth of any kind. The

institution performs many different functions. One of these
functions is to draw a boundary between public and private power. Property
draws a

circle around the activities of each private individual or
organization. Within that circle, the owner has a greater degree of freedom
than without.

Outside, he must justify or explain his actions, and show
his authority. Within, he is master, and the state must explain and justify any

interference. It is as if property shifted the burden of
proof; outside, the individual has the burden; inside, the burden is on
government to

demonstrate that something the owner wishes to do should not
be done.

Thus, property performs the function of maintaining
independence, dignity and pluralism in society by creating zones within which
the

majority has to yield to the owner. Whim, caprice,
irrationality and “antisocial” activities are given the protection of law; the
owner may do what

all or most of his neighbors decry. The Bill of Rights also
serves this function, but while the Bill of Rights comes into play only at
extraordinary

moments of conflict or crisis, property affords day-to-day
protection in the ordinary affairs of life. Indeed, in the final analysis the
Bill of Rights

depends upon the existence of private property. Political
rights presuppose that individuals and private groups have the will and the
means to act

independently. But so long as individuals are motivated
largely by self-interest, their well-being must first be independent. Civil
liberties must

have a basis in property, or bills of rights will not
preserve them.

Property is not a natural right but a deliberate
construction by society. If such an institution did not exist, it would be
necessary to create it,

in order to have the kind of society we wish. The majority
cannot be

#1132

expected, on specific issues, to yield its power to a
minority. Only if the minority’s will is established as a general principle can
it keep the

majority at bay in a given instance. Like the Bill of
Rights, property represents a general, long range protection of individual and
private

interests, created by the majority for the ultimate good of
all. * * *

From the individual’s point of view, it is not any
particular kind of power, but all kinds of power, that are to be feared. This
is the lesson of

the public interest state. The mere fact that power is
derived from the majority does not necessarily make it less oppressive. Liberty
is more than

the right to do what the majority wants, or to do what is
“reasonable.” Liberty is the right to defy the majority, and to do what is
unreasonable.

The great error of the public interest state is that it
assumes an identity between the public interest and the interest of the
majority.

The reform, then, has not done away with the importance of
private property. More than ever the individual needs to possess, in whatever

form, a small but sovereign island of his own. * * *

The most clearly defined problem posed by government largess
is the way it can be used to apply pressure against the exercise of

constitutional rights. A first principle should be that
government must have no power to “buy up” rights guaranteed by the
Constitution. It should

not be able to impose any condition on largess that would be
invalid if imposed on something other than a “gratuity.” * * *

Beyond the limits deriving from the Constitution, what
limits should be imposed on governmental power over largess? Such limits,

whatever they may be, must be largely self-imposed and
self-policed by legislatures; the Constitution sets only a bare minimum of
limitations on

legislative policy. * * *

[P]rocedure offers a valuable means for restraining
arbitrary action. * * * The grant, denial, revocation, and administration of
all types of

government largess should be subject to scrupulous
observance of fair procedures. Action should be open to hearing and contest,
and based upon

a record subject to judicial review. The denial of any form
of privilege or benefit on the basis of undisclosed reasons should no longer be

tolerated. Nor should the same person sit as legislator,
prosecutor, judge and jury, combining all the functions of government in such a
way as to

make fairness virtually impossible. There is no
justification for the survival of arbitrary methods where valuable rights are
at stake. * * *

Eventually those forms of largess which are closely linked
to status must be deemed to be held as of right. * * * Confiscation, if used at
all,

should be the ultimate, not the most common and convenient
penalty. The presumption should be that the professional man will keep his
license,

and the welfare recipient his pension. These interests
should be “vested.” If revocation is necessary, not by reason of the fault of
the individual

holder, but by reason of overriding demands of public
policy,

#1133

perhaps payment of just compensation would be appropriate.
The individual should not bear the entire loss for a remedy primarily intended
to

benefit the community.

The concept of right is most urgently needed with respect to
benefits like unemployment compensation, public assistance, and old age

insurance. These benefits are based upon a recognition that
misfortune and deprivation are often caused by forces far beyond the control of
the

individual, such as technological change, variations in
demand for goods, depressions, or wars. The aim of these benefits is to
preserve the self-

sufficiency of the individual, to rehabilitate him where
necessary, and to allow him to be a valuable member of a family and a
community; in

theory they represent part of the individual’s rightful
share in the commonwealth. Only by making such benefits into rights can the
welfare state

achieve its goal of providing a secure minimum basis for
individual well-being and dignity in a society where each man cannot be wholly
the

master of his own destiny. * * *

If the individual is to survive in a collective society, he
must have protection against its ruthless pressures. There must be sanctuaries
or

enclaves where no majority can reach. To shelter the
solitary human spirit does not merely make possible the fulfillment of
individuals; it also

gives society the power to change, to grow, and to
regenerate, and hence to endure. These were the objects which property sought
to achieve, and

can no longer achieve. The challenge of the future will be
to construct, for the society that is coming, institutions and laws to carry on
this work.

Just as the Homestead Act was a deliberate effort to foster
individual values at an earlier time, so we must try to build an economic basis
for

liberty today—a Homestead Act for rootless twentieth century
man. We must create a new property.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Reich sounds a theme that plays an increasingly prominent
role in theorizing about property—its role in promoting individual autonomy.
See,

e.g., Hanoch Dagan, A Liberal Theory of Property ( 2021 );
Gregory S. Alexander, The Complex Core of Property, 94 Cornell L. Rev. 1063 (
2009 ).

Reich’s focus is on the importance of property in shielding
individuals from explicit or implicit coercion by the government. In this
respect, his thesis is

about the importance of government forbearance. Others have
argued that widely dispersed private property ownership is vital to the
formation of

political parties, dissident organizations, and a free
press. See, e.g., Milton Friedman, Capitalism and Freedom 7 – 21 ( 1962 );
Richard Pipes, Property and

Freedom 209 – 81 ( 1999 ). Reich notes that when wealth
takes the form of government “largesse”—government jobs, transfer payments, and
licenses and

permits—not only are the means to resist government eroded,
but the affirmative opportunities for government manipulation and control of
individual

beliefs and practices are greatly enhanced, by conditioning
the receipt of largesse on conformity to government-approved behavior. His
proposed

solution, that government largesse should be treated more
like

```



1134



```

conventional private property, in order to provide a source
of security in individuals that would promote autonomy and liberty, was equally
innovative.

2 .Does Reich exaggerate the extent to which government has
taken over (or is about to take over) the functions previously served by
private

property? Would the size of the government’s budget be a
good proxy for how much government largesse has displaced traditional property,
or can

government achieve the same effect through regulatory
mandates and exceptions? Is the problem that governments do not face
competition? In some

contexts, state and local governments compete for residents
and businesses. On the local level this idea is associated with the Tiebout
Hypothesis we

encountered in Chapter IX in connection with zoning. Does
the federal government face increasing competition from abroad?

3 .Does Reich provide a persuasive account of how government
“largesse” is going to be transformed into a right that the government cannot

manipulate in order to induce individual conformity? He
urges courts to enforce constitutional rights (to free speech, for example)
when the government

tries to condition receipt of government largesse on
forgoing the exercise of constitutional rights, and he urges courts to strictly
enforce procedural

limitations on the termination of government entitlements.
In these respects his counsel was, on the whole, very successful, as courts
moved strongly to

support these positions in the years after the publication
of his article. But he was cautious about advocating strict judicial review of
legislation

qualifying or eliminating largesse, and in this respect his
caution has also characterized the judicial attitude going forward. The Court
has never

recognized anything like a “takings” claim for a government
reduction in benefits or employment opportunities. More broadly, can one say
that there is a

right to exclude others or the government from interfering
with government largesse? Does this mean the analogy to property breaks down?
For

example, owners of private property can use self-help to
protect their assets against intrusions or depredations. There is no obvious
“self-help” remedy

for those who are dependent on government largesse. Does
this mean that the aspiration to transform largesse into a kind of “new
property” is doomed to

failure? Or is group action though politics the main avenue
of self-help to protect government largesse? If so, does this reduce the new
property to the

playing out of politics? For an effort to revive Reich’s
vision in a modern progressive vein, see David A. Super, A New New Property,
113 Colum. L.

Rev. 1773 ( 2013 ).

4 .Reich acknowledges that property performs many functions,
but his focus throughout is on property’s role in promoting individual
autonomy. In

other words, his vision of why property is valuable is
largely a “consumerist” one rather than a “producerist” one. Property is
regarded as important

because it promotes individual freedom in the way we
organize our private lives; its role as a means of organizing resources for
production is ignored. In

practice, are these roles more closely linked than Reich
acknowledges?

```



5 .Whether or not it was inspired by Reich’s writing, the
Supreme Court’s decision in Goldberg unleashed a “due process revolution,” as
lower



```

```



1135



```

courts began requiring that claimants holding a variety of
government “entitlements” critical to their wellbeing be given hearings before
such

entitlements were terminated. See Henry J. Friendly, “Some
Kind of Hearing,” 123 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1267 , 1273 ( 1975 ). Perhaps taken aback,
the Court

quickly perceived that it was necessary to provide clearer
guidance about when different types of government benefits should be regarded
as “property”

sufficient to trigger due process protection. The effort to
provide that guidance came in the following landmark decisions.

#### Board of Regents v. Roth

```



Supreme Court of the United States, 1972.



408 U.S. 564.



```

■ MR.
JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court. In 1968 the respondent,
David Roth, was hired for his first teaching job as assistant

professor of political science at Wisconsin State
University-Oshkosh. He was hired for a fixed term of one academic year. The
notice of his

faculty appointment specified that his employment would
begin on September 1, 1968, and would end on June 30, 1969. The respondent

completed that term. But he was informed that he would not
be rehired for the next academic year.

The respondent had no tenure rights to continued employment.
Under Wisconsin statutory law a state university teacher can acquire tenure

as a “permanent” employee only after four years of
year-to-year employment. Having acquired tenure, a teacher is entitled to
continued

employment “during efficiency and good behavior.” A
relatively new teacher without tenure, however, is under Wisconsin law entitled
to nothing

beyond his one-year appointment. There are no statutory or
administrative standards defining eligibility for re-employment. State law thus

clearly leaves the decision whether to rehire a nontenured
teacher for another year to the unfettered discretion of university officials.

The procedural protection afforded a Wisconsin State
University teacher before he is separated from the University corresponds to
his job

security. As a matter of statutory law, a tenured teacher
cannot be “discharged except for cause upon written charges” and pursuant to
certain

procedures. A nontenured teacher, similarly, is protected to
some extent during his one-year term. Rules promulgated by the Board of Regents

provide that a nontenured teacher “dismissed” before the end
of the year may have some opportunity for review of the “dismissal.” But the
Rules

provide no real protection for a nontenured teacher who
simply is not re-employed for the next year. He must be informed by February 1

“concerning retention or non-retention for the ensuing
year.” But “no reason for non-retention need be given. No review or appeal is
provided in

such case.”

In conformance with these Rules, the President of Wisconsin
State University-Oshkosh informed the respondent before February 1, 1969,

#1136

that he would not be rehired for the 1969–1970 academic
year. He gave the respondent no reason for the decision and no opportunity to
challenge

it at any sort of hearing.

The respondent then brought this action in Federal District
Court alleging that the decision not to rehire him for the next year infringed
his

Fourteenth Amendment rights. He attacked the decision both
in substance and procedure. First, he alleged that the true reason for the
decision

was to punish him for certain statements critical of the
University administration, and that it therefore violated his right to freedom
of speech.

Second, he alleged that the failure of University officials
to give him notice of any reason for nonretention and an opportunity for a
hearing

violated his right to procedural due process of law.

The District Court granted summary judgment for the
respondent on the procedural issue, ordering the University officials to
provide him

with reasons and a hearing. The Court of Appeals, with one
judge dissenting, affirmed this partial summary judgment. We granted
certiorari. The

only question presented to us at this stage in the case is
whether the respondent had a constitutional right to a statement of reasons and
a hearing

on the University’s decision not to rehire him for another
year. We hold that he did not.

I

The requirements of procedural due process apply only to the
deprivation of interests encompassed by the Fourteenth Amendment’s

protection of liberty and property. When protected interests
are implicated, the right to some kind of prior hearing is paramount. But the
range of

interests protected by procedural due process is not
infinite.

The District Court decided that procedural due process
guarantees apply in this case by assessing and balancing the weights of the
particular

interests involved. It concluded that the respondent’s
interest in re-employment at Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh outweighed the

University’s interest in denying him re-employment
summarily. Undeniably, the respondent’s re-employment prospects were of major
concern to

him—concern that we surely cannot say was insignificant. And
a weighing process has long been a part of any determination of the form of

hearing required in particular situations by procedural due
process. But, to determine whether due process requirements apply in the first
place,

we must look not to the “weight” but to the nature of the
interest at stake. We must look to see if the interest is within the Fourteenth

Amendment’s protection of liberty and property.

“Liberty” and “property” are broad and majestic terms. They
are among the “[g]reat [constitutional] concepts... purposely left to gather

meaning from experience.... [T]hey relate to the whole
domain of social and economic fact, and the statesmen who founded this Nation
knew

too well that only a stagnant society remains unchanged.”
National Mutual

#1137

Ins. Co. v. Tidewater Transfer Co., 337 U.S. 582, 646 (1949)
(Frankfurter, J., dissenting). For that reason, the Court has fully and finally
rejected

the wooden distinction between “rights” and “privileges”
that once seemed to govern the applicability of procedural due process
rights.^9 The

Court has also made clear that the property interests
protected by procedural due process extend well beyond actual ownership of real
estate,

chattels, or money. By the same token, the Court has
required due process protection for deprivations of liberty beyond the sort of
formal

constraints imposed by the criminal process.

Yet, while the Court has eschewed rigid or formalistic
limitations on the protection of procedural due process, it has at the same
time

observed certain boundaries. For the words “liberty” and
“property” in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment must be given

some meaning.

II

“While this court has not attempted to define with exactness
the liberty... guaranteed [by the Fourteenth Amendment], the term has

received much consideration and some of the included things
have been definitely stated. Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from

bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to
contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful
knowledge,

to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship
God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy
those

privileges long recognized... as essential to the orderly
pursuit of happiness by free men.” Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923).
In a

Constitution for a free people, there can be no doubt that
the meaning of “liberty” must be broad indeed. See, e.g., Bolling v. Sharpe,
347 U.S.

497, 499–500 (1954); Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645
(1972).

There might be cases in which a State refused to re-employ a
person under such circumstances that interests in liberty would be implicated.

But this is not such a case.

The State, in declining to rehire the respondent, did not
make any charge against him that might seriously damage his standing and

associations in his community. It did not base the
nonrenewal of his contract on a charge, for example, that he had been guilty of
dishonesty, or

immorality. Had it done so, this would be a different case.
For “[w]here a person’s good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake
because

of what the government is doing to him, notice and an
opportunity to be heard are essential.” Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S.
433, 437

(1971). In such a case, due process would accord an
opportunity to refute the charge before University officials. In the present
case, however,

there is no suggestion whatever that the respondent’s “good
name, reputation, honor, or integrity” is at stake.

#1138

Similarly, there is no suggestion that the State, in
declining to re-employ the respondent, imposed on him a stigma or other
disability that

foreclosed his freedom to take advantage of other employment
opportunities. The State, for example, did not invoke any regulations to bar
the

respondent from all other public employment in state
universities. Had it done so, this, again, would be a different case. * * *

To be sure, the respondent has alleged that the nonrenewal
of his contract was based on his exercise of his right to freedom of speech.
But

this allegation is not now before us. The District Court
stayed proceedings on this issue, and the respondent has yet to prove that the
decision not

to rehire him was, in fact, based on his free speech
activities.

Hence, on the record before us, all that clearly appears is
that the respondent was not rehired for one year at one university. It
stretches the

concept too far to suggest that a person is deprived of
“liberty” when he simply is not rehired in one job but remains as free as
before to seek

another.

III

The Fourteenth Amendment’s procedural protection of property
is a safeguard of the security of interests that a person has already acquired

in specific benefits. These interests—property interests—may
take many forms.

Thus, the Court has held that a person receiving welfare
benefits under statutory and administrative standards defining eligibility for
them

has an interest in continued receipt of those benefits that
is safeguarded by procedural due process. Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254
(1970). See

Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 611 (1960). Similarly, in
the area of public employment, the Court has held that a public college
professor

dismissed from an office held under tenure provisions,
Slochower v. Board of Education, 350 U.S. 551 (1956), and college professors
and staff

members dismissed during the terms of their contracts,
Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183 (1952), have interests in continued
employment that

are safeguarded by due process. Only last year, the Court
held that this principle “proscribing summary dismissal from public employment

without hearing or inquiry required by due process” also
applied to a teacher recently hired without tenure or a formal contract, but
nonetheless

with a clearly implied promise of continued employment.
Connell v. Higginbotham, 403 U.S. 207, 208 (1971).

Certain attributes of “property” interests protected by
procedural due process emerge from these decisions. To have a property interest
in a

benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract
need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.
He must,

instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it. It is
a purpose of the ancient institution of property to protect those claims upon
which

people rely in their daily lives, reliance that must not be
arbitrarily

#1139

undermined. It is a purpose of the constitutional right to a
hearing to provide an opportunity for a person to vindicate those claims.

Property interests, of course, are not created by the
Constitution. Rather they are created and their dimensions are defined by
existing rules

or understandings that stem from an independent source such
as state law—rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that
support

claims of entitlement to those benefits. Thus, the welfare
recipients in Goldberg v. Kelly , supra, had a claim of entitlement to welfare
payments

that was grounded in the statute defining eligibility for
them. The recipients had not yet shown that they were, in fact, within the
statutory terms

of eligibility. But we held that they had a right to a
hearing at which they might attempt to do so.

Just as the welfare recipients’ “property” interest in
welfare payments was created and defined by statutory terms, so the
respondent’s

“property” interest in employment at Wisconsin State
University-Oshkosh was created and defined by the terms of his appointment.
Those terms

secured his interest in employment up to June 30, 1969. But
the important fact in this case is that they specifically provided that the
respondent’s

employment was to terminate on June 30. They did not provide
for contract renewal absent “sufficient cause.” Indeed, they made no provision

for renewal whatsoever.

Thus, the terms of the respondent’s appointment secured
absolutely no interest in re-employment for the next year. They supported

absolutely no possible claim of entitlement to
re-employment. Nor, significantly, was there any state statute or University
rule or policy that

secured his interest in re-employment or that created any
legitimate claim to it. In these circumstances, the respondent surely had an
abstract

concern in being rehired, but he did not have a property
interest sufficient to require the University authorities to give him a hearing
when they

declined to renew his contract of employment.

IV

Our analysis of the respondent’s constitutional rights in
this case in no way indicates a view that an opportunity for a hearing or a
statement

of reasons for nonretention would, or would not, be
appropriate or wise in public colleges and universities. For it is a written
Constitution that we

apply. Our role is confined to interpretation of that
Constitution.

We must conclude that the summary judgment for the
respondent should not have been granted, since the respondent has not shown
that he

was deprived of liberty or property protected by the
Fourteenth Amendment. The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is
reversed and

the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion. It is so ordered. Reversed and remanded.

#### Perry v. Sindermann

```



Supreme Court of the United States, 1972.



408 U.S. 593.



```

■ MR.
JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court. From 1959 to 1969 the
respondent, Robert Sindermann, was a teacher in the state

college system of the State of Texas. After teaching for two
years at the University of Texas and for four years at San Antonio Junior
College, he

became a professor of Government and Social Science at
Odessa Junior College in 1965. He was employed at the college for four
successive

years, under a series of one-year contracts. He was
successful enough to be appointed, for a time, the cochairman of his
department.

During the 1968–1969 academic year, however, controversy
arose between the respondent and the college administration. The respondent

was elected president of the Texas Junior College Teachers
Association. In this capacity, he left his teaching duties on several occasions
to testify

before committees of the Texas Legislature, and he became
involved in public disagreements with the policies of the college’s Board of
Regents.

In particular, he aligned himself with a group advocating
the elevation of the college to four-year status—a change opposed by the
Regents. And,

on one occasion, a newspaper advertisement appeared over his
name that was highly critical of the Regents.

Finally, in May 1969, the respondent’s one-year employment
contract terminated and the Board of Regents voted not to offer him a new

contract for the next academic year. The Regents issued a
press release setting forth allegations of the respondent’s insubordination.
But they

provided him no official statement of the reasons for the
nonrenewal of his contract. And they allowed him no opportunity for a hearing
to

challenge the basis of the nonrenewal. * * *

[T]he Court of Appeals held that, despite the respondent’s
lack of tenure, the failure to allow him an opportunity for a hearing would
violate

the constitutional guarantee of procedural due process if
the respondent could show that he had an “expectancy” of re-employment. * * *

The respondent’s lack of formal contractual or tenure
security in continued employment at Odessa Junior College * * * is highly
relevant to

his procedural due process claim. But it may not be entirely
dispositive.

We have held today in Board of Regents v. Roth that the
Constitution does not require opportunity for a hearing before the nonrenewal
of a

nontenured teacher’s contract, unless he can show that the
decision not to rehire him somehow deprived him of an interest in “liberty” or
that he

had a “property” interest in continued employment, despite
the lack of tenure or a formal contract. In Roth the teacher had not made a
showing

on either point to justify summary judgment in his favor.

#1141

Similarly, the respondent here has yet to show that he has
been deprived of an interest that could invoke procedural due process
protection.

As in Roth , the mere showing that he was not rehired in one
particular job, without more, did not amount to a showing of a loss of liberty.
Nor

did it amount to a showing of a loss of property.

But the respondent’s allegations—which we must construe most
favorably to the respondent at this stage of the litigation—do raise a

genuine issue as to his interest in continued employment at
Odessa Junior College. He alleged that this interest, though not secured by a
formal

contractual tenure provision, was secured by a no less
binding understanding fostered by the college administration. In particular,
the respondent

alleged that the college had a de facto tenure program, and
that he had tenure under that program. He claimed that he and others
legitimately

relied upon an unusual provision that had been in the
college’s official Faculty Guide for many years * * *.

Moreover, the respondent claimed legitimate reliance upon
guidelines promulgated by the Coordinating Board of the Texas College and

University System that provided that a person, like himself,
who had been employed as a teacher in the state college and university system
for

seven years or more has some form of job tenure. Thus, the
respondent offered to prove that a teacher with his long period of service at
this

particular State College had no less a “property” interest
in continued employment than a formally tenured teacher at other colleges, and
had no

less a procedural due process right to a statement of
reasons and a hearing before college officials upon their decision not to
retain him.

We have made clear in Roth, supra , that “property”
interests subject to procedural due process protection are not limited by a few
rigid,

technical forms. Rather, “property” denotes a broad range of
interests that are secured by “existing rules or understandings.” A person’s
interest

in a benefit is a “property” interest for due process
purposes if there are such rules or mutually explicit understandings that
support his claim of

entitlement to the benefit and that he may invoke at a
hearing.

A written contract with an explicit tenure provision clearly
is evidence of a formal understanding that supports a teacher’s claim of

entitlement to continued employment unless sufficient
“cause” is shown. Yet absence of such an explicit contractual provision may not
always

foreclose the possibility that a teacher has a “property”
interest in re-employment. For example, the law of contracts in most, if not
all,

jurisdictions long has employed a process by which
agreements, though not formalized in writing, may be “implied.” 3 A. Corbin on
Contracts

§§ 561–572A (1960). Explicit contractual provisions may be
supplemented by other agreements implied from “the promisor’s words and conduct

in the light of the surrounding circumstances.” Id., at §
562. And, “the meaning of [the promisor’s] words and acts is found by relating
them to

the usage of the past.” Ibid.

#1142

A teacher, like the respondent, who has held his position
for a number of years, might be able to show from the circumstances of this
service

—and from other relevant facts—that he has a legitimate
claim of entitlement to job tenure. Just as this Court has found there to be a
“common

law of a particular industry or of a particular plant” that
may supplement a collective-bargaining agreement, United Steelworkers v.
Warrior &

Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U.S. 574, 579 (1960), so there may be an
unwritten “common law” in a particular university that certain employees shall
have

the equivalent of tenure. This is particularly likely in a
college or university, like Odessa Junior College, that has no explicit tenure
system even

for senior members of its faculty, but that nonetheless may
have created such a system in practice. See C. Byse & L. Joughin, Tenure in

American Higher Education 17–28 (1959).^7

In this case, the respondent has alleged the existence of
rules and understandings, promulgated and fostered by state officials, that may

justify his legitimate claim of entitlement to continued
employment absent “sufficient cause.” We disagree with the Court of Appeals
insofar as it

held that a mere subjective “expectancy” is protected by
procedural due process, but we agree that the respondent must be given an
opportunity

to prove the legitimacy of his claim of such entitlement in
light of “the policies and practices of the institution.” Proof of such a
property interest

would not, of course, entitle him to reinstatement. But such
proof would obligate college officials to grant a hearing at his request, where
he

could be informed of the grounds for his nonretention and
challenge their sufficiency. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Whatever else one makes of these decisions, do they tend
to confirm Charles Reich’s insight that threats to terminate government
largesse—here

efforts to terminate public university teachers after they
have taken controversial political positions—can be used to punish dissidents
and induce

conformity to officially-favored viewpoints? On remand from
the decision in _Roth_ , a jury concluded that Wisconsin State
University-Oshkosh had

declined to renew Roth’s employment contract in retaliation
for his exercise of First Amendment rights. He was awarded $ 6 , 746 in
damages. The issue

of reinstatement was not pressed, since Roth had found new
employment teaching political science at Purdue. See Chronicle of Higher
Education, Nov.

26 , 1973 , p. 3 col. 1. Sindermann settled his case with
the

```



1143



```

Texas Regents, declining an offer of reinstatement and
accepting a payment of $ 48 , 000 instead. Odessa American, Nov. 12 , 1972 p. 1
col. 1.

2. _Roth_ and _Sindermann_ were apparently designed to
   legitimize the due process revolution sparked by _Goldberg v. Kelly_ (and by
   Reich’s advocacy

of a “new property”?), by reconciling it with the language
of the Constitution and broad constitutional traditions. In the years after
these decisions, the

Court recognized due process “property” interests in a wide
variety of government entitlements. These included rights to a public
education, Goss v.

Lopez, 419 U.S. 565 ( 1975 ); utility services, Memphis
Light, Gas & Water Div. v. Craft, 436 U.S. 1 ( 1978 ); a horse trainer’s
license, Barry v. Barchi,

443 U.S. 55 ( 1979 ); and a cause of action against
discrimination, Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422 , 430 ( 1982 ). More
recently, the Court

has adopted a more cautious attitude, and the expansion of
due process rights appears to have halted. See generally Richard J. Pierce,
Jr., The Due

Process Counterrevolution of the 1990 s?, 96 Colum. L. Rev.
1973 ( 1996 ). See, for example, Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales _,_ 545 U.S.
748 ( 2005 ),

where the Court held a judicial restraining order against a
woman’s ex-husband did not give rise to a protected “property” right, even
though the order

had a warning printed on it in large caps indicating that
enforcement was mandatory. The police failed to heed her repeated reports that
the ex-husband

had violated the order and taken their three children, whom
he ultimately murdered. The Court declined to read the warning on the
restraining order

literally and remarked that the order did not “resemble any
traditional conception of property.” Id. at 766.

3 .Do you agree with the Court in _Roth_ that the language
of the Due Process Clauses requires a threshold determination that the claimant
has an

interest in either “liberty” or “property” (or, presumably,
“life”) at stake? This aspect of _Roth_ reflects an important change in the
law:

```



Prior to Roth , Supreme Court definitions of ‘liberty’ and
‘property’ had amounted to taking the words ‘life, liberty, and property’ as a
unitary



concept embracing all interests valued by sensible men.
After Roth , however, each word of the clause must be examined separately; so



examined, we find that they do not embrace the full range of
state conduct having serious impact upon individual interests.



```

Henry Paul Monaghan, Of “Liberty” and “Property,” 62 Cornell
L. Rev. 405 , 409 ( 1977 ). Did the Framers of the Constitution intend this
kind of careful

parsing of each word as a threshold condition applying due
process? Consider that the words chosen by the Framers appear to describe the
three types of

punishment the state is likely to mete out for violation of
a crime—execution (life), imprisonment (liberty), or fines and forfeitures
(property)—and that

the Clause appears in the Fifth Amendment, which is largely
concerned with criminal procedure. (But not exclusively—it also contains the
Takings

Clause!) This might suggest the Framers understood these
words collectively to embrace any action by the state that would constitute a
“punishment” or

“sanction” directed against an individual. Consider also the
Declaration of Independence, which refers to “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
Happiness” as

a general phrase descriptive of inalienable human rights.
What are the

```



1144



```

pros and cons of having a very broad and general threshold
trigger for due process protection (“all interests valued by sensible men”) as
opposed to three

more narrowly defined triggers with strong common-law
connotations?

4 .Notice that the Court in _Roth_ seemed to prescribe
different methodologies for ascertaining whether an interest is “liberty” as
opposed to

“property.” The methodology for ascertaining liberty is not
discussed in any detail, other than to quote a long list of rights from Meyer
v. Nebraska, 262

U.S. 390 , 399 ( 1923 ), a case holding that parents have a
substantive due process right to teach their children German. In discussing the
methodology for

identifying property rights, however, the Court notes that
property rights are “not created by the Constitution.” Does this imply that the
Court views

liberty as being created by the Constitution, whereas
property is created by statutes, common-law decisions, and other types of
subconstitutional law? In

later decisions, some Justices would quarrel with the notion
that liberty is created by the Constitution, insisting that liberties are
“inalienable rights” that

are recognized by but not created by the Constitution. See
Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 , 489 ( 1995 ) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting);
Meachum v. Fano, 427

U.S. 215 , 230 ( 1976 ) (Stevens, J., dissenting). On this
view, liberty is a “natural right” that exists independently of the
Constitution; the significance of

the Due Process Clauses is that they recognize this right
and provide that it may not be taken without due process. Why cannot “property”
also be

regarded as an inalienable or natural right? Is there
something about property that would make it more problematic to attempt to
develop a “list” of

inalienable property rights, analogous to the list of
liberties set forth in _Meyer_ and endorsed in _Roth_? In this regard,
reconsider the material in Chapter III

about different values subject to ownership, and how the
scope of property rights has changed over time. By the way, what happened to
“life” in the

_Roth_ discussion? What do you suppose the _Roth_ Court
would say about the proper method for ascertaining the meaning of “life”?

5 .When the Court announces that property rights are “not
created by the Constitution” but rather “are created and their dimensions are
defined by

existing rules and understandings” such as those grounded in
state law, does the Court mean that courts should look to state law to
determine what the

state regards to be property? Or does it mean only that
courts should look to state law to see what sorts of interests are recognized
and protected and

should then independently determine as a matter of federal
constitutional law whether these interests are property? See Monaghan, Of
“Liberty” and

“Property,” supra; Thomas W. Merrill, The Landscape of
Constitutional Property, 86 Va. L. Rev. 885 , 916 – 42 ( 2000 ). The question
is closely related to

the more general issue, considered in Chapter I, whether
“property” has some essentialist meaning, or should be considered as merely a
contingent

bundle of rights. If the Court understands that “property”
has some distinctive federal constitutional meaning, did it provide adequate
guidance in

spelling out that meaning?

6 .The Court proclaims that it has rejected the “wooden
distinction” between “rights” and “privileges” in determining the scope of the
Due Process

Clause. But how, if at all, does the rights/privileges
distinction differ from the entitlements/unilateral-expectancies distinction
adopted by the Court in

```



1145



```

its place? Is it because “entitlements” are grounded in law?
But aren’t the “rights” that were juxtaposed to “privileges” also grounded in
law, such as the

common law? The Court doesn’t seem to mean that entitlements
must be grounded in written law; _Sindermann_ clearly holds that entitlements
can also

be implied as a matter of common law. Is the shift in
locution from rights/privileges to entitlements/expectancies merely a verbal
cover for the fact that

the Court has shifted the boundary of property for due
process purposes to include various types of contractual or programmatic
government benefits

previously thought to be excluded?

7 .Is the Court’s approach to defining property—looking to
settled expectations rooted in objective sources like state statutory and
common law—

broadly consistent with the understanding of “property”
reflected in _Charles River Bridge_? Recall that all the Justices in that case
appeared to accept the

idea that a corporate franchise to operate a toll bridge is
a type of “property” entitled to constitutional protection. A corporate
franchise or charter is a

type of “entitlement” that did not exist at common law, but
is purely the creature of legislation. In this sense, it is not too fanciful to
describe corporate

charters as a kind of “new property,” analogous to the new
property rights given due process protection in _Goldberg_ and _Roth_. See
Kenneth J.

Vandevelde, The New Property of the Nineteenth Century: The
Development of the Modern Concept of Property, 29 Buff. L. Rev. 325 ( 1980 ).
Or does

this overlook one potentially critical difference? Corporate
charters and franchises, like common-law property, include the right to exclude
others from

certain assets; the government entitlements recognized to be
property in _Goldberg_ and _Roth_ do not confer any right to exclude, but are
more like

contractual promises to a future stream of payments. Did the
Court push the concept of “property” one step too far in _Roth_?

8 .Recall the case of Ephram Nestor, discussed in the
excerpt from Charles Reich, who was stripped of his Social Security benefits
when Congress

passed a statute retroactively eliminating benefits for
aliens who had been members of the Communist Party. See Flemming v. Nestor, 363
U.S. 603

( 1960 ). The decisions in _Goldberg_ , _Roth,_ and
_Sindermann_ , stimulated hope among many that the Supreme Court would grant
substantive constitutional

protection under the takings or due process clauses to
government “largesse” like Social Security and disability benefits. Such was
not to be. The Court

drew the line at procedural due process protection for the
“new property,” and steadfastly refused to give more than rational basis review
to legislation

eliminating or reducing government entitlements. See Bowen
v. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587 , 605 ( 1987 ); Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to
Social

Security Entrapment, 477 U.S. 41 ( 1986 ); Richardson v.
Belcher, 404 U.S. 78 , 81 – 84 ( 1971 ). Although it is not unlikely that
_Flemming v. Nestor_ would

come out differently today if challenged under the First
Amendment, the Court’s conclusion that Social Security benefits are not
“property” for

substantive constitutional purposes seems well entrenched.
Does it make sense to say that government entitlements are “property” for
procedural due

process purposes but not for purposes of the Takings Clause
or substantive due process?

```



1146



```

9 .Consider procedural due process as yet another general
strategy for resolving the government forbearance puzzle debated in _Charles
River

Bridge_. Implicit in the strategy is the principle of
legality—that the government may deprive persons of property only in accordance
with principles of

law previously laid down. A central purpose of requiring
notice and an opportunity for a hearing before any deprivation occurs is to
give the owner a

chance to show that the government lacks legal justification
for its action. In effect, the government must forbear from interfering with
previously

recognized property rights unless it has a clear legal and
factual justification for doing so. See John Harrison, Substantive Due Process
and the

Constitutional Text, 83 Va. L. Rev. 493 , 497 ( 1997 ). Of
course, this strategy does not provide full protection against frustration of
expectations. If the

government recognizes property at T 1 , then changes the law
at T 2 in such a way as to authorize the property to be taken, and then gives
the owner a

hearing at T 3 in order to challenge the legality of the
taking, the hearing will show that the government deprivation has been legally
authorized at T 2.

This is a point of time before the proposed taking, and thus
satisfies the principle of legality, even though it is also a point in time
after T 1 , and thus may

frustrate expectations formed at T 1. Still, if one of the
lessons of _Charles River Bridge_ is the need for some compromise between
accommodating

change and protecting expectations, doesn’t the procedural
due process strategy provide a kind of accommodation? As a compromise, does it
lean too

far toward accommodating change or toward protecting
expectations? Does the answer depend on the nature of the government promise in
question?

### 2 .VESTED RIGHTS AND THE CANON DISFAVORING RETROACTIVE

LAWS

Recall that Chief Justice Taney, in Charles River Bridge ,
remarks that “[i]t is well settled, by the decisions of this court, that a
state law may

be retrospective in its character, and may divest vested
rights, and yet not violate the constitution of the United States, unless it
also impairs the

obligation of a contract.” This was arguably accurate when
it was written in 1837. There was no federal constitutional protection against

impairment of “vested rights” by state governments other
than the Contracts Clause of Article I, § 10; consequently, any federal
constitutional

claim that a state had impaired vested rights had to be
characterized as an impairment of contract. The doctrine of substantive due
process and the

regulatory takings doctrine developed somewhat later, and
there was no basis for applying either doctrine as a matter of federal
constitutional law

to the states until the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in
1868. See Barron v. Baltimore, 32 U.S. 243 (1833) (original Takings Clause of
Fifth

Amendment does not apply to the states). This does not mean
that state courts applying state constitutional law were similarly limited in
their

efforts to protect vested rights. Protection of vested
rights was arguably the single most important theme of American constitutional
law in the

early decades of the Republic. See Edward S. Corwin, The
Basic Doctrine of American

#1147

Constitutional Law, 12 Mich. L. Rev. 247 (1914); see also
Gordon S. Wood, The Origins of Vested Rights in the Early Republic, 85 Va. L.
Rev.

1421 (1999). If federal courts were confined largely to the
Contracts Clause, state courts applied a variety of doctrines to reinforce
government

forbearance from interfering with so-called vested rights,
including the insistence that legislation had to be prospective and general,
restrictive

definitions of the police power, and natural rights
theories. Corwin, supra, at 255–76.

What exactly was included in the concept of “vested rights”?
We have encountered this concept before. Recall from Chapter V that property

law distinguishes between vested and nonvested future
interests and that certain consequences follow from this; for example,
nonvested future

interests are subject to the Rule against Perpetuities and
vested interests are not. We noted there that “vesting” is ambiguous because
sometimes it

means vested in interest and sometimes it means vested in
possession. Recall too from Chapter IX that many state courts in the context of
zoning

have treated established uses of property as vested, in the
sense that a zoning law cannot be enacted that would have the effect of making
an

existing nonconforming use unlawful.

In constitutional law as it developed in the nineteenth
century, vested rights came to be understood as including, paradigmatically,
private

rights of property previously acquired. As Professor
Woolhandler has explained,

That private rights [were] involved [was] understood to mean
that legislatures [could] not make such laws retroactive. Thus, while

state legislatures could relax the requirements for adverse
possession in the future, they could not provide that past acts meeting the

new requirements had already effected the transfer of
property; likewise, while state legislatures could change their inheritance
laws

prospectively, they could not declare that property that had
already descended to A now belonged instead to B. Retroactive laws of this

sort were often said either to deprive people of property
without “due process of law” or to cross the line between “legislative” and

“judicial” power. These two formulations drew on the same
idea: the process that was considered “due” for an authoritative disposition

of core private rights involved “judicial” application of
the standing laws, and the separation of powers kept legislatures from

supplying this process.

Ann Woolhandler, Public Rights, Private Rights, and
Statutory Retroactivity, 94 Geo. L.J. 1015, 1024–25 (2006). See also Corwin,
supra, at 275

(concluding that the core interest encompassed by the
doctrine of vested rights was the right “of one who had already acquired some
title of

control over some particular piece of property, in the
physical sense, to continue in that control”).

#1148

Over time, the concept of “vested rights” gradually lost its
allure as a basis for constitutional protection of property rights. This was
due in

significant part to persistent academic criticism. The Legal
Realists in particular savaged the vested rights doctrine in the early decades
of the

twentieth century. See generally James L. Kainen, The
Historical Framework for Reviving Constitutional Protection for Property and
Contract

Rights, 79 Cornell L. Rev. 87, 103–11 (1993). Three
especially telling points were advanced in that era.

First, the vested rights doctrine assumed that interests
were either vested or not vested, when in fact legal interests came with
different

degrees of expectation about how secure they were against
legal change. The classic example was provided by the repeal of married women’s

dower rights. Dower was the right of a widow to a life
estate in one-third of the real property of which her husband was seized during
the

marriage. Modification of dower rights was often a matter of
controversy in the nineteenth century, see Kainen, supra, at 105–06. Dower has
now

been replaced in all states by some form of gender-neutral
spousal share. See Chapter V on the Married Women’s Property Acts. Before the

legislation, at what point in time would a woman’s
expectation of receiving dower be strong enough to be regarded as a “vested”
right? Before

marriage? After marriage? After the acquisition of real
property during marriage? After the death of the husband? There is no clearly
correct

answer to this question, and it seemed artificial to insist
that there was a single condition or set of circumstances that defined when the
interest

became vested.

Second, the vested rights doctrine was prone to circularity.
This was because whether an interest was regarded as “vested” was in part a

function of whether courts found legislative interference
with the interest to be a violation of the Constitution. Thus, critics
maintained that the

identification of an interest as “vested” often simply
begged the question; courts enjoined legislation interfering with vested rights
or required the

state to compensate for taking vested rights, but the right
was regarded as vested—of high security—because the court deemed it to be
immune

from legislative abrogation or deemed its taking to require
compensation.

Third, and perhaps most importantly, the concept of vested
rights was not embodied in the language of the U.S. Constitution nor did it

appear in most state constitutions. As courts were
challenged to justify their authority to intercede to protect property rights
against popularly

enacted legislation, they found it increasingly desirable to
rest their decisions on specific constitutional clauses, like the Contracts
Clause and the

Takings Clause, rather than on the more amorphous concept of
vested rights. The U.S. Supreme Court led the way. After a few early decisions

that flirted with the idea of protecting vested rights as a
matter of natural law, see Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. ( 3 Dall.) 386 (1798);
Fletcher v. Peck, 10

U.S. (6 Cranch) 87 (1810), the Court after the second decade
of the nineteenth century consistently identified some specific textual

#1149

authority for its interventions (recall again Chief Justice
Taney’s comments in Charles River Bridge ). State supreme courts clung to the
idea of

vested rights much longer, but gradually followed the
example of the U.S. Supreme Court.

Yet notwithstanding its general demise as a doctrine of
constitutional law, the doctrine of vested rights reemerged as a canon of
construction

for interpreting legislation that arguably frustrates the
expectations of owners of established property rights. The most complete modern

discussion of the canon that statutes should be interpreted
as applying only prospectively unless Congress clearly intends the contrary is
found in

the following decision.

#### Landgraf v. USI Film Products

```



Supreme Court of the United States, 1994.



511 U.S. 244.



```

■
JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court. [The Civil Rights Act of
1991 imposed new types of liability on employers who engage in

certain types of discrimination. At issue was whether the
new Act applied to cases that were pending but not finally adjudicated on the
effective

date of the new Act. The Act said that it would “take effect
upon enactment” and did not specifically address whether it would apply

retroactively to conduct that took place or litigation that
was commenced before enactment. The Court held that the Act should be
interpreted to

apply only to future conduct. Its decision includes the
following discussion:]

[T]he presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply
rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than

our Republic. Elementary considerations of fairness dictate
that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to
conform

their conduct accordingly; settled expectations should not
be lightly disrupted. For that reason, the “principle that the legal effect of
conduct

should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed
when the conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal.” Kaiser Aluminum
&

Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 855 (1990) (Scalia,
J. concurring). In a free, dynamic society, creativity in both commercial and
artistic

endeavors is fostered by a rule of law that gives people
confidence about the legal consequences of their actions.

It is therefore not surprising that the antiretroactivity
principle finds expression in several provisions of our Constitution. [The
Court briefly

discusses the Ex Post Facto Clause, the Contracts Clause,
the Takings Clause, the Bill of Attainder Clause, and the Due Process Clause.]

---

These provisions demonstrate that retroactive statutes raise
particular concerns. The Legislature’s unmatched powers allow it to sweep away

settled expectations suddenly and without individualized
consideration. Its responsivity to political pressures poses a risk that it

#1150

may be tempted to use retroactive legislation as a means of
retribution against unpopular groups or individuals. * * *

The Constitution’s restrictions, of course, are of limited
scope. Absent a violation of one of those specific provisions, the potential

unfairness of retroactive civil legislation is not a
sufficient reason for a court to fail to give a statute its intended scope.
Retroactivity provisions

often serve entirely benign and legitimate purposes, whether
to respond to emergencies, to correct mistakes, to prevent circumvention of a
new

statute in the interval immediately preceding its passage,
or simply to give comprehensive effect to a new law Congress considers
salutary.

However, a requirement that Congress first make its
intention clear helps ensure that Congress itself has determined that the
benefits of

retroactivity outweigh the potential for disruption or
unfairness.

While statutory retroactivity has long been disfavored,
deciding when a statute operates “retroactively” is not always a simple or
mechanical

task. Sitting on Circuit, Justice Story offered an
influential definition in Society for Propagation of the Gospel v. Wheeler, 22
F.Cas. 756 (No.

13,156) (CCNH 1814), a case construing a provision of the
New Hampshire Constitution that broadly prohibits “retrospective” laws both

criminal and civil. Justice Story first rejected the notion
that the provision bars only explicitly retroactive legislation, i.e.,
“statutes... enacted to

take effect from a time anterior to their passage.” Id., at
767. Such a construction, he concluded, would be “utterly subversive of all the
objects”

of the prohibition. Ibid. Instead, the ban on retrospective
legislation embraced “all statutes, which, though operating only from their
passage,

affect vested rights and past transactions.” Ibid. “Upon
principle,” Justice Story elaborated, “every statute, which takes away or
impairs vested

rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new
obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in respect to
transactions or

considerations already past, must be deemed retrospective...
.” Ibid. (citing Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386 (1798), and Dash v. Van Kleeck, 7
Johns.

477 (N.Y. 1811)).

Though the formulas have varied, similar functional
conceptions of legislative “retroactivity” have found voice in this Court’s
decisions and

elsewhere.

A statute does not operate “retrospectively” merely because
it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute’s
enactment, or

upsets expectations based in prior law. Rather, the court
must ask whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events

completed before its enactment. The conclusion that a
particular rule operates “retroactively” comes at the end of a process of
judgment

concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law
and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a
relevant past

event. Any test of retroactivity will leave room for
disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of
legal changes

with perfect philosophical clarity. However, retroactivity
is a matter on

#1151

which judges tend to have “sound... instinct[s],” see
Danforth v. Groton Water Co., 59 N.E. 1033, 1034 (Mass. 1901) (Holmes, J.), and
familiar

considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and
settled expectations offer sound guidance.

Since the early days of this Court, we have declined to give
retroactive effect to statutes burdening private rights unless Congress had
made

clear its intent. * * * The largest category of cases in
which we have applied the presumption against statutory retroactivity has
involved new

provisions affecting contractual or property rights, matters
in which predictability and stability are of prime importance. The presumption
has

not, however, been limited to such cases. * * *

The presumption against statutory retroactivity had special
force in the era in which courts tended to view legislative interference with

property and contract rights circumspectly. In this century,
legislation has come to supply the dominant means of legal ordering, and

circumspection has given way to greater deference to
legislative judgments. See Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S., at
15–16; Home

Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398,
436–444 (1934). But while the constitutional impediments to retroactive civil
legislation are

now modest, prospectivity remains the appropriate default
rule. Because it accords with widely held intuitions about how statutes
ordinarily

operate, a presumption against retroactivity will generally
coincide with legislative and public expectations. Requiring clear intent
assures that

Congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential
unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable
price to pay

for the countervailing benefits. Such a requirement
allocates to Congress responsibility for fundamental policy judgments
concerning the proper

temporal reach of statutes, and has the additional virtue of
giving legislators a predictable background rule against which to legislate. *

When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the
events in suit, the court’s first task is to determine whether Congress has
expressly

prescribed the statute’s proper reach. If Congress has done
so, of course, there is no need to resort to judicial default rules. When,
however, the

statute contains no such express command, the court must
determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether
it would

impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a
party’s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to
transactions

already completed. If the statute would operate
retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern
absent clear

congressional intent favoring such a result. * * *

■
JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY and JUSTICE THOMAS join, concurring
in the judgment. I of course agree with the Court that there

exists a judicial presumption, of great antiquity, that a
legislative enactment affecting substantive rights does not apply retroactively
absent clear

statement to the contrary. * * * [But I disagree] with the

#1152

Court’s analysis of * * * the meaning of retroactivity. * *

* The critical issue, I think, is not whether the rule affects “vested rights,”
  or governs

substance or procedure, but rather what is the relevant
activity that the rule regulates. Absent clear statement otherwise, only such
relevant

activity which occurs after the effective date of the
statute is covered. Most statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct, and
hence will not be

applied in trials involving conduct that occurred before
their effective date. But other statutes have a different purpose and therefore
a different

relevant retroactivity event. A new rule of evidence
governing expert testimony, for example, is aimed at regulating the conduct of
trial, and the

event relevant to retroactivity of the rule is introduction
of the testimony. Even though it is a procedural rule, it would unquestionably
not be

applied to testimony already taken —reversing a case on
appeal, for example, because the new rule had not been applied at a trial which
antedated

the statute. * * *

[S]tatutes eliminating previously available forms of
prospective relief provide [a] challenge to the Court’s approach. Courts
traditionally

withhold requested injunctions that are not authorized by
then-current law, even if they were authorized at the time suit commenced and
at the

time the primary conduct sought to be enjoined was first
engaged in. See, e.g., American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades
Council, 257

U.S. 184 (1921); Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254
U.S. 443, 464 (1921). The reason, which has nothing to do with whether it is

possible to have a vested right to prospective relief, is
that “obviously, this form of relief operates only in futuro ,” ibid. Since the
purpose of

prospective relief is to affect the future rather than
remedy the past, the relevant time for judging its retroactivity is the very
moment at which it is

ordered.^3

[Dissenting opinions omitted.]

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Recall from Chapter V that the common law also contains
constructional rules favoring the protection of vested rights. For example, if
a

remainder can be interpreted as being either vested or
contingent, courts favor the vested interpretation. This saves the remainder
from possible

invalidation under the Rule against Perpetuities, and from
other doctrines like the Destructibility of Contingent Remainders. Similarly,
courts developed

rules for construing defeasible fees so as to make it less
likely that the grantee would experience a forfeiture. A constructional rule
similar to _Landgraf_

also applies in the administrative law context. See Bowen v.
Georgetown University Hospital, 488 U.S. 204 ( 1988 ) (holding that a federal

```



1153



```

administrative agency may promulgate rules with retroactive
effect only if clearly authorized to do so by Congress).

2 .The clear intent rule of _Landgraf_ , together with the
various common-law rules favoring the preservation of vested rights, represents
yet another

strategy for reaching an accommodation between the forces of
change and the need to protect reliance interests. What are the advantages and

disadvantages of this strategy, relative to other
strategies, such as the rule of strict construction of charters, the
requirement of due process hearings

before property is taken, and the requirement of
compensation for takings of property? Suppose A owns Blackacre and builds a
waste recycling plant on

it. At the time the plant is constructed, waste recycling is
a lawful use. After the plant is up and running, the legislature adopts a
statute that says: “All

recycling plants are hereby prohibited. This statute takes
effect upon enactment.” Does the canon of interpretation in _Landgraf_ provide
any protection

for A’s investment in the recycling plant?

3 .Is the clear intent rule of _Landgraf_ consistent with
the rule of strict construction of _Charles River Bridge_? The rule of strict
construction is

designed to minimize the creation of vested rights. The
clear statement rule is designed to minimize the frustration of vested rights.
So working in

tandem, they do not directly conflict. But is the rationale
for the clear statement rule, as set forth in _Landgraf_ , more in keeping with
the general position

of Chief Justice Taney or Justice Story as to where the
balance of accommodation should be struck between change and reliance?

Academic Perspectives on Retroactivity

Issues about the optimal policy toward legal retroactivity
come up in many contexts, but nowhere more than in taxation, where the issue is

often described in terms of “transition policy.” A
prototypical example of a change in tax law arguably requiring transition
relief would be

repealing the tax exemption from a previously tax-exempt
class of bonds. Academic commentators have come to widely varying conclusions
at

different times about the wisdom of worrying about
retroactivity and providing transition relief, such as paying damages or
providing for some

kind of grandfathering of existing arrangements (e.g.,
allowing existing tax-exempt bonds to continue to remain tax-exempt and
applying the

change only to newly issued bonds).

The idea with the longest history—extending back to Justice
Story and beyond—is that the government should provide transition relief in

order to internalize the harm of a taking or other new
measure that defeats settled expectations. See Daniel E. Troy, Retroactive
Legislation

(1998); Richard A. Epstein, Beware of Legal Transitions: A
Presumptive Voice for the Reliance Interest, 13 J. Contemp. Legal Issues 69
(2003).

In the commentary on retroactivity, this “Old School” has
been challenged by (what else?) a “New School,” which argues that transition
relief is

inappropriate because of actions that owners can take to
foresee and mitigate a taking or other retroactive law. See, e.g., Michael J.
Graetz, Legal

Transitions: The Case of Retroactivity in Income Tax
Revision, 126

#1154

U. Pa. L. Rev. 47, 65 (1977); Louis Kaplow, An Economic
Analysis of Legal Transitions, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 511 (1986). These scholars tend
to

emphasize the need for flexibility and the benefits of
public-regarding projects. (Recall Chief Justice Taney’s arguments about
changed

conditions and the need to accommodate new technology in
Charles River Bridge. ) They also analogize government-created risk to market-

created risk, the latter of which we normally assume parties
can deal with on their own, through insurance or diversification.

More recently in what is sometimes termed a “New New School”
(or is it “New Old School”?), some have proposed that transition relief

may be appropriate when government is making a commitment
upon which it is desirable for people to rely. Sometimes the government may

want to make a specific commitment to forbear from change or
to provide transition relief. It might want to do this in order to avoid having
to

pay a premium to induce persons to take certain actions
(given the risk of future governmental changes in policy) or to obviate
wasteful

anticipatory private efforts at trying to avoid being bitten
by change. See, e.g., Daniel Shaviro, When Rules Change: An Economic and
Political

Analysis of Transition Relief and Retroactivity (2000); Kyle
D. Logue, Tax Transitions, Opportunistic Retroactivity, and the Benefits of

Government Precommitment, 94 Mich. L. Rev. 1129 (1996).
Other times, the government may want to avoid all transition relief in order to
force

people to anticipate desirable change. An example would be a
polluter who may face new regulations restricting effluent about which the
polluter

has had good information. See Saul Levmore, Changes,
Anticipations, and Reparations, 99 Colum. L. Rev. 1657, 1661–86 (1999); see
also

Michael Doran, Legislative Compromise and Tax Transition
Policy, 74 U. Chi. L. Rev. 545 (2007); Saul Levmore, Retroactive Taxation, 3
New

Palgrave Dictionary of Economics and the Law 340 (1998);
Kyle D. Logue, If Taxpayers Can’t Be Fooled, Maybe Congress Can: A Public

Choice Perspective on the Tax Transition Debate, 67 U. Chi.
L. Rev. 1507 (2000) (book review); Jonathan S. Masur & Jonathan R. Nash,
The

Institutional Dynamics of Transition Relief, 85 N.Y.U. L.
Rev. 391 (2010); Richard L. Revesz & Allison L. Westfahl Kong, Regulatory
Change

and Optimal Transition Relief, 105 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1581
(2011). The general issue then becomes: When if at all is it desirable for
government to

make general commitments to provide transition relief, or
should government commitments of transition relief be channeled into formal

contracts limited to specific situations?

### 3 .STARE DECISIS

Another general legal doctrine that promotes government
forbearance is stare decisis—the practice of “standing by what has been
decided.”

Courts have long said that the duty to follow precedent
carries special force where property rights are involved. As the Court put it
in Payne v.

Tennessee , 501 U.S. 808, 828 (1991), “[c]onsiderations in
favor

#1155

of stare decisis are at their acme in cases involving
property and contract rights, where reliance interests are involved.” In
contrast, the Court

continued, “stare decisis carries comparatively less weight
in cases ‘involving procedural and evidentiary rules.’ ” Id. As the following
excerpt

suggests, this distinction is well supported by...
precedent!

From the Founding Era to the Rehnquist Court

1999 ).



```

IV.Rules of Property and Reliance Interests

Chief Justice Rehnquist’s opinion for the Court in Payne v.
Tennessee relied extensively on the notion of a sliding stare decisis scale on

commercial reliance grounds. In abandoning the previously
held view that the Eighth Amendment precluded victim-impact evidence in capital

cases, Rehnquist asserted that “[c]onsiderations in favor of
stare decisis are at their acme in cases involving property and contract
rights, where

reliance interests are involved.” Because the question in
Payne “involve[ed] procedural and evidentiary rules,” Rehnquist concluded that

considerations in favor of stare decisis were at a minimum,
and error correction was more freely available. * * *

A.Rules of Property in the Founding Era

History provides ample support for Chief Justice Rehnquist’s
side of the Payne debate. Blackstone’s explication of error correction drew no

express distinction between commercial cases and other
decisions, but the distinction had already taken hold in the English courts.
One early

English statement appeared in Morecock v. Dickins , a 1768
case in the High Court of Chancery.^222 The issue in that case was whether
Dickins,

the holder of a legal mortgage on property, should be
considered to have received constructive notice of a prior equitable mortgage
held by

Morecock, by virtue of Morecock’s registration of the deed.
Counsel for Morecock argued that registration should serve as constructive
notice.

Although Lord Camden indicated his inclination to agree with
this argument on its merits, he refused to abandon settled precedent on the
point:

If this was a new point, it might admit of difficulty; but
the determination in Bedford v. Bacchus seems to have settled it, and it would

be mischievous to disturb it.... Much property has been
settled, and conveyances have proceeded upon the ground of that

determination.... A thousand neglects to search have been
occasioned by that determination, and therefore I cannot take upon me to

alter it. If this was a new case, I should have

#1156

my doubts; but the point is closed by that determination,
which has been acquiesced in ever since.

The commercial reliance interests in Morecock were
unmistakable. “A thousand neglects to search” the registries had been premised
on the

proposition that registration of an equitable mortgage was
not constructive notice to a legal mortgagee, and thus Lord Camden preserved
the

precedent despite his doubts about its merits.

The converse position was also recognized in the English
courts of the founding era. In Robinson v. Bland , the court determined, among

other things, to abandon the general rule limiting a
prevailing plaintiff in a breach of contract suit to interest accruing to “the
day that the writ is

sued out.”^227 The general rule was abandoned as certainly
unreasonable, and replaced with a new standard awarding interest accruing “down
to

the time of the last act done by the Court, to liquidate the
demand.” Judge Wilmot’s opinion offered a reliance-based justification for the
court’s

correction of this error:

Where an error is established and has taken root, upon which
any rule of property depends, it ought to be adhered to by the Judges, till

the Legislature thinks proper to alter it: lest the new
determination should have a retrospect, and shake many questions already
settled:

but the reforming erroneous points of practice can have no
such bad consequences; and therefore they may be altered at pleasure, when

found to be absurd or inconvenient.

Thus, Judge Wilmot conceived of a bifurcated stare decisis
standard that is reminiscent of that offered by Chief Justice Rehnquist in
Payne. A

decision establishing “any rule of property” must be
retained, Wilmot says, even when in error. But error in “points of practice” is
a different

matter. A change of course on such issues does not affect
reliance interests, and thus the courts may abandon precedents of this nature
with fewer

misgivings.

James Kent’s conception of stare decisis similarly
recognized the increased importance of stability as to rules of property. * * *
He

recognized that the policy of stability and certainty was
more important in certain areas of the law than in others. When decisions
“create a

practical rule of property,” Kent explained, they should be
adhered to even when subsequent judges “may feel the hardship, or not perceive
the

reasonableness, of the rule.”^232

B.Rules of Property in the Supreme Court

Although the dominant stare decisis question addressed by
the Marshall Court was the extent of the Court’s power to abandon precedent on

the basis of its correctness, several Marshall Court
decisions

#1157

acknowledged the notion of enhanced deference to property
rules in the context of yielding to purportedly erroneous decisions of the
state courts.

In addition, the Marshall Court adverted to a similar
approach in the context of suggesting that some deference was owed to a
legislative

construction of the Constitution, especially where property
rights were implicated. Otherwise, the application and development of the rule
of

property standard in the Supreme Court occurred in the Taney
era.

Indeed, the Taney Court’s principal contribution to the
stare decisis dialogue was to consider whether the Court’s power of error
correction

varied depending on the extent of property and contract
rights at stake. * * *

Chief Justice Taney [emphasized] the rule of property theme
in his opinion for the Court in The Propeller Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh.^262
The

Genesee Chief presented the question whether the federal
courts’ admiralty jurisdiction extended to a suit arising out of a collision on
Lake

Ontario. Presumably, the federal courts would have lacked
jurisdiction under the Court’s earlier pronouncement as to the scope of Article
III’s

Admiralty Clause in The Steam-Boat Thomas Jefferson.^264
Justice Story’s opinion for the Court in The Thomas Jefferson had held that
admiralty

under Article III extended only to cases where the voyage at
issue “was substantially performed, or to be performed, upon the sea, or upon
waters

within the ebb and flow of the tide.” Because the Missouri
River voyage in The Thomas Jefferson “not only in its commencement and

termination, but in all its intermediate progress, was
several hundreds of miles above the ebb and flow of the tide,” Story’s opinion
held that any

exercise of admiralty jurisdiction in the case was beyond
that authorized by Article III.

Chief Justice Taney’s opinion in The Genesee Chief candidly
overruled The Thomas Jefferson and adopted a new test for admiralty

jurisdiction. Taney argued that the Thomas Jefferson test
would undermine the goal of “a perfect equality in the rights and the
privileges of the

citizens of the different states,” in that the benefits of
“safety and convenience of commerce, and the speedy decision of controversies”
presented

by the admiralty courts would be reserved only for “states
bordering on the Atlantic.” Moreover, Taney asserted that the “ebb and flow”
test was

“arbitrary, without any foundation in reason” in that “there
is certainly nothing in the ebb and flow of the tide that makes the waters
peculiarly

suitable for admiralty jurisdiction, nor any thing in the
absence of a tide that renders it unfit.” Thus, even though the ebb and flow
test

concededly was the prevailing standard in England at the
time of the framing of the Constitution, Chief Justice Taney rejected it as
“purely

artificial and arbitrary as well as unjust.” Accordingly,
Taney concluded that the admiralty jurisdiction properly turned on whether the

#1158

waters at issue are navigable, and not on whether they are
within the ebb and flow of the tide.

Despite the conviction of Taney’s disdain for the rationale
and correctness of The Thomas Jefferson , he expressly admitted to a certain

degree of angst in overruling the case: “It is the decision
in the case of the Thomas Jefferson which mainly embarrasses the court in the
present

inquiry. We are sensible of the great weight to which it is
entitled.” Having noted the general importance of adherence to precedent,
however,

Taney emphasized that “[t]he case of the Thomas Jefferson
did not decide any question of property, or lay down any rule by which the
right of

property should be determined.” Taney explained that if The
Thomas Jefferson had established a rule of property, stare decisis would have

demanded adherence to that decision:

If it had, we should have felt ourselves bound to follow it
notwithstanding the opinion we have expressed. For every one would

suppose that after the decision of this court, in a matter
of that kind, he might safely enter into contracts, upon the faith that rights
thus

acquired would not be disturbed. In such a case, stare
decisis is the safe and established rule of judicial policy and should always
be

adhered to.... But the decision referred to has no relation
to rights of property. It was a question of jurisdiction only, and the judgment

we now give can disturb no rights of property nor interfere
with any contracts heretofore made.... And as we are convinced that the

former decision was founded in error, and that the error, if
not corrected, must produce serious public as well as private inconvenience

and loss, it becomes our duty not to perpetuate it.^273 * *
*

C.Rules of Property and Reliance Interests: A Comparative
Analysis

By the founding era, English courts and American
commentators had embraced the notion of an enhanced rule of stare decisis in
cases

involving rules of property. That principle also dominated
the Court’s treatment of precedent during the Taney era. Indeed, on closer
scrutiny

even the apparent anomalies noted above disappear. The
extent of the Taney Court’s willingness to correct apparently erroneous
precedent turned

entirely on whether a change of course would “disturb...
rights of property... or interfere with any contracts heretofore made.” * * *

By the Taney era, then, the Court had settled on a
bifurcated stare decisis standard comparable to that advocated by Chief Justice
Rehnquist

in Payne.

#1159

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .As Lee suggests, the idea that respect for precedent is
especially important where property rights are concerned has very old roots.
Note that

before the merger of law and equity, one of the maxims of
equity was to forbear from undoing the common law (and its predictability) with
respect to

property. See Charles Grey, The Boundaries of the Equitable
Function, 20 Am. J. Legal Hist. 192 ( 1976 ).

2 .Notwithstanding its ancient roots, is the principle of
respect for precedent honored more in the breach? We have considered a number
of cases in

this book where courts have either explicitly or implicitly
overruled earlier decisions. Some examples: Pardee v. Camden Lumber Co.,
Chapter I,

overruling a decision prohibiting injunctive relief for
cutting timber on land; _Oregon ex rel. Thornton v. Hay_ , Chapter III,
recognizing for the first time a

customary public right to use beach property in coastal
Oregon; _Higday v. Nickolaus_ , Chapter III, arguably departing from Missouri
law in adopting a

rule of reasonable use for groundwater rights; _Berg v.
Wiley_ , Chapter IV, adopting for the first time a rule prohibiting self-help
in the recovery of real

property; _Shelley v. Kraemer_ , Chapter IX, disregarding
prior decisional law suggesting that enforcement of racial covenants did not
violate the

Fourteenth Amendment; _Javins v. First National Realty_ ,
Chapter VI, adopting an implied warranty of habitability for residential
leases; _Sommer v.

Kridel_ , Chapter VI, adopting a duty to mitigate damages
when a tenant abandons; _Kendall v. Ernest Pestana_ , Chapter VI, overruling
prior caselaw

allowing a landlord to withhold consent to assignment of a
lease for any or no reason at all; _Tulk v. Moxhay_ , Chapter IX, permitting
equitable servitudes

to run with the land, contrary to prior decisions limiting
running covenants to landlord-tenant relations. Do these decisions support the
proposition,

reflected in the Lee excerpt and endorsed in _Payne_ , that
courts will generally avoid “disturbing rules of property” whereas they are
more inclined to

overrule rules of evidence and procedure? Do these cases
suggest that a neat division of “property rules” and other kinds of rules is
difficult or even

infeasible? Or are cases reproduced in property casebooks
likely to contain an unrepresentative sample of decisions in terms of stare
decisis, insofar as

they include a disproportionate percentage of controversial
or pathbreaking decisions?

3 .Note that the strong rule of stare decisis in property is
designed to encourage forbearance by a different branch of government than the
one

usually of concern in this connection: the courts. Is
unanticipated change in the rules a greater cause for concern when it comes
from the courts, or a

lesser concern? One factor here is that rule changes by
courts are nearly always retroactive, in that they apply to the parties in the
case where the change

is announced. See Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 509
U.S. 86 ( 1993 ). Another factor is that courts are usually regarded as more
independent than

legislatures, and hence less likely to succumb to pressure
from the public or particular interest groups to interfere with established
property rights.

Which factor is more important in determining how much
weight we should give to the need for forbearance by courts? See, e.g., Ronald
A. Cass,

Decisionmaking, 75

### 4 .FOREIGN INVESTMENT TREATIES

Government forbearance is increasingly an issue in
international law. Specifically, developed nations like the United States
frequently

negotiate foreign investment treaties which include among
their provisions agreements by the host nation to forbear from interfering with
capital

projects owned or financed by firms in the developed nation.
The most famous of the foreign investment protection regimes was contained in

Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement or
NAFTA, entered into by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This has been

superseded by the passage of the
United-States-Mexican-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but the investor-protection
provisions of NAFTA have

been copied to one degree or another in numerous bilateral
and multilateral investor protection treaties.

A basic purpose of these investor protection treaties is to
provide assurances to private investors that if they commit significant capital
to

projects in another country they will not encounter
discriminatory treatment or attempts by the host country to expropriate the
investment after it

has been made. In order to provide these assurances, the
treaties commit the signatory countries to binding arbitration with disgruntled
foreign

investors. The arbitrators are given authority take evidence
and review the dispute, and if they find the host country has committed a
violation,

they can order the host country to pay damages.

Perhaps the most controversial decision rendered by an
arbitration panel established by NAFTA was Metalclad Corp. v. United Mexican

States, Arbitration Panel, International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes, 2000, Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, 40 I.L.M. 36,
40 I.L.M. 36

(2001), 2001 WL 313693. Metalclad, a U.S. corporation,
formed a Mexican subsidiary, COTERIN, to purchase land in Guadalcazar, Mexico,
for

the purpose of constructing a hazardous waste disposal site.
Before Metalclad purchased the property, the Federal Government of Mexico and
the

Mexican State of San Luis Potosi informed Metalclad that
they would issue all the necessary permits. Construction of the facility began
in May

1994, and was completed in March 1995. Demonstrators
disrupted a planned open house or “inauguration” of the site. Later that year,
Metalclad

was informed that the Guadalcazar municipal authorities had,
without notice to Metalclad, denied a construction permit for the facility.

Subsequent efforts to resolve the impasse though litigation
in the Mexican courts failed to achieve a resolution. Metalclad then initiated
an

arbitration proceeding against the Mexican government under
Chapter 11 of NAFTA.

#1161

The arbitration panel found that the Mexican government had
denied Metalclad “fair and equitable treatment” under NAFTA, in violation of

Article 1 105, by promising that all necessary permits had
been issued and then allowing municipal authorities to insist on a building
permit,

which was denied. The panel found that the building permit
was not justified by Article 11 14, which allows the host country to ensure
that

investment activity is undertaken in a manner sensitive to
environmental concerns. This was because federal permits had been issued
indicating

that the project satisfied all environmental requirements,
and the local building permit was denied without reference to any defects in
the facility

that might indicate environmental concerns. Because the
action of the municipal authorities violated the “fair and equal treatment”
requirement,

the panel found that it was “tantamount to expropriation”
under Article 1110 of NAFTA. The panel ordered Mexico to pay Metalclad

$16,685,000 in damages. Mexico brought an action alleging
that the panel had acted beyond the scope of its authority, which was tried, as

required by the treaty, in a Canadian court. United Mexican
States v. Metalclad Corp., 89 B.C. L. R. 3d 359 (2001). The court upheld the
award,

with modifications, and Mexico paid up.

Some commentators have condemned decisions like Metalclad
for offering foreign investors more protection against a lack of government

forbearance than domestic investors receive. Compare Vicki
Been & Joel C. Beauvais, The Global Fifth Amendment? NAFTA’s Investment

Protections and the Misguided Quest for an International
“Regulatory Takings” Doctrine, 78 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 30, 59 (2003) (decrying
Metalclad

for suggesting “that Article 1110 may be interpreted to
require compensation in several circumstances in which the Fifth Amendment has
never

before been applied”) with Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez &
William W. Park, The New Face of Investment Arbitration: NAFTA Chapter 1 1, 28

Yale J. Int’l L. 365, 366 (2003) (arguing that “arbitration
under investment treaties such as NAFTA will enhance the type of asset
protection that

facilitates wealth-creating cross-border capital flows,
bringing net gains for both host state and foreign investor”) and Charles S.
Brower &

Stephan W. Schill, Is Arbitration a Threat or a Boon to the
Legitimacy of International Investment Law?, 9 Chi. J. Int’l L. 471 (2009)
(arguing in

favor of a system of arbitration as promoting international
investment).

Metalclad would likely come out differently if it arose
today under the USMCA. The new treaty clarifies that “fair and equitable
treatment”

means only that the host country must comply with the
requirements of customary international law and does not impose any more
exacting

requirement. The treaty also includes a list of regulatory
actions that do not constitute indirect expropriation, including
non-discriminatory

actions that protect the environment. See Jerry L. Lai, A
Tale of Two Treaties: A Study of NAFTA and the USMCA’s Investor-State Dispute

#1162

Settlement Mechanisms, 35 Emory Int’l L. Rev. 259, 262–65
(2021). Perhaps most notably, the USMCA no longer allows arbitration panels to

find that host nations have committed acts that are
“tantamount” to expropriation; only actual expropriation is actionable.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Should liability under NAFTA Chapter 11 or the USMCA
apply to circumstances in which foreign investors suffer discrimination or
differential

regulatory burdens relative to domestic investors? Consider
the saga of the Keystone XL Pipeline, designed to transfer oil from Canada to
refineries on

the Gulf Coast in the United States. When the Obama
Administration denied a permit allowing the pipeline to cross the border into
the United States, the

Canadian firm planning to build the pipeline sued the United
States for $ 15 billion in damages for violating NAFTA. See Todd Tucker,
TransCanada is

suing the U.S. over Obama’s rejection of the Keystone XL
pipeline. The U.S. might lose, Wash. Post (Jan. 8 , 2016 ),
[http://www.](http://www.) washingtonpost. com/

news/ monkey-cage/ wp/ 2016 / 01 / 08 / transcanada-i. The
action was dropped when the Trump Administration reversed the decision and
issued the required

permit. The Biden Administration promptly reversed the
decision once again, and now TransCanada has renewed its action demanding $ 15
billion in

damages from the U.S. under NAFTA. The pipeline has become a
primary political symbol for those concerned about climate change and opposed
to

further petrochemical exploration and development. Did the
fact that it was a Canadian project, or that it was to transport Canadian oil,
contribute to the

hostility? Note that the Obama and Biden Administrations
were able to block the project only because it crossed an international border;
a purely

domestic pipeline (say from North Dakota to Louisiana) would
not have been subject to the same approval requirement. Is this enough to
establish

discrimination or differential treatment?

2 .What would Chief Justice Taney, author of the majority
opinion in _Charles River Bridge_ , say about the decision of the arbitration
panel in the

_Metalclad_ case? Did the Mexican government promise
Metalclad with sufficient clarity that the company would be allowed to build a
hazardous waste

disposal facility without a local building permit?

Political Risk Insurance

One of the charges Been and Beauvais level against the
Metalclad decision is that the need for compensation as ex post insurance for
the

risk of legal and regulatory change is obviated in part by
the availability of ex ante insurance against political risk. 78 N.Y.U. L. Rev.
at 38. This

raises an important question about all the devices to
encourage government forbearance we have considered: Can and should they be
replaced by

the purchase of insurance by persons anxious about the
possible risk to their property from future changes in government policy? We
expect

property owners to purchase insurance against fires, floods,
and theft. Why not require them to purchase insurance against

#1163

government expropriation or other changes in government
policy that destroy or devalue property rights?

The possibility of relying on insurance to compensate for
takings of property or changes in government regulatory policy that adversely

affect property has been discussed by a variety of scholars.
See, e.g., Jonathan S. Masur & Jonathan Remy Nash, The Institutional
Dynamics of

Transition Relief, 85 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 391, 406–28 (2010);
Steve P. Calandrillo, Eminent Domain Economics: Should “Just Compensation” Be

Abolished, and Would “Takings Insurance” Work Instead?, 60
Ohio St. L.J. 451 (2003); Louis Kaplow, An Economic Analysis of Legal

Transitions, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 511 (1986); Lawrence Blume
& Daniel L. Rubinfeld, Compensation for Takings: An Economic Analysis, 72
Cal. L.

Rev. 569 (1984). These authors pose the question: Are
takings and other types of risks of adverse government action adequately
addressed by

political risk insurance that would spread these risks over
time and across multiple owners? Early commentators recognized that private

insurance would face two difficulties in this context. One
is the problem of adverse selection : Those people who face the greatest
likelihood of

having their property taken or regulated may be ones most
likely to purchase insurance, which would increase the costs of claims. Blume
&

Rubinfeld, supra, at 59 5–96. Another problem is moral
hazard : Once persons have insurance, they may not put up much resistance to
having

their property taken or regulated, which would also increase
the cost of claims. Id. at 594. More recently commentators have observed that

private insurance typically requires a large set of
experiential data that insurers can use to predict the size and frequency of
losses and thus set a

price for insurance; takings and other types of adverse
government action, in contrast, occur relatively infrequently and have
hard-to-predict

effects on property owners. Masur & Nash, supra, at
421–26. Given these difficulties, most commentators have concluded that the
government

probably must step in and provide insurance (in the form of
ex post compensation for takings) for persons unable to self-insure or purchase

private insurance. In theory, however, if these problems
could somehow be overcome, private insurance would do the trick just fine.

The political risks faced by overseas investors provide an
interesting test of the proposition that insurance can provide a substitute for

government forbearance. Political risk insurance has been
available to U.S. firms investing overseas since 1971, when Congress created
the

Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), a
semi-public corporation capitalized by the federal government and backed by the
full faith

and credit of the federal government. For many years,
political risk insurance was available only through OPIC and a similar agency
of the World

Bank. Commentators suggested that political risk insurance
was not available without government subsidy, or perhaps that government-

supported insurance has an inherent advantage over private
insurers because the government-backed insurers can intervene with host

#1164

countries to reduce the incidence of loss. See Maura B.
Perry, A Model for Efficient Foreign Aid: The Case for the Political Risk
Insurance

Activities of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation,
36 Va. J. Int’l L. 511 (1996).

Interestingly, however, the private insurance industry has
recently made significant inroads into the political risk insurance market, to
the

point where private insurance now accounts for 48% of the
market. See Jennifer M. DeLeonardo, Are Public and Private Political Risk
Insurance

Two of a Kind? Suggestions for a New Direction for
Government Coverage, 45 Va. J. Int’l L. 737, 745 (2005). DeLeonardo cites a
number of

factors that may account for the new viability of private
political risk insurance, including improved information about political risks
in

developing countries and rising demand for such insurance
after 9/11. But one of the most important reasons she cites is the emergence of

bilateral investment treaties, with their prohibitions on
expropriation and their provisions for mandatory dispute settlement through
arbitration.

Id. at 757–59. These treaty commitments, she argues,
function as a warranty of forbearance by the host country and offer a type of
co-insurance

(payable by the host country) for any investment losses. “By
putting private source insurers more on par with public source insurers in
terms of

obtaining payments after settling claims, the U.S.
government may have enabled private source insurers to offer products that more
closely

resemble public source [political risk insurance].” Id. at
759–60.

If DeLeonardo is correct that private, non-subsidized
political risk insurance becomes viable only if host governments make credible

commitments to forbear from interfering with property, then
this suggests that private insurance cannot be a perfect substitute for other
legal

mechanisms to promote forbearance. To the contrary, it
appears that legal mechanisms (such as a right to compensation) may be a
precondition to

the development of a functioning insurance market—at least a
private market not subsidized by taxpayers. Evidently, these other mechanisms

reduce the risk of government expropriation or interference
to the point where private insurance can handle the residual (uncompensated)
risk. So

perhaps insurance is not the complete answer to political
risk after all. See also William A. Fischel & Perry Shapiro, Takings,
Insurance, and

Michelman: Comments on Economic Interpretations of Just
Compensation Law, 17 J. Legal Stud. 269 (1988) (arguing that insurance only
evens

out the timing and variance of losses but does not eliminate
the demoralization caused by expropriations and other government
interferences).

#1165

### C. THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN

“[N]or shall private property be taken for public use
without just compensation.”

—U.S. Const., amend. V.

The power of eminent domain presents the starkest
confrontation between private property and government forbearance. When the

government exercises the power of eminent domain, it
“condemns” property, meaning the government compels a transfer of the property
in

return for monetary compensation determined by a government
entity, typically a court. Eminent domain actions are regarded as “in rem,”

meaning the condemning authority proceeds against the
property being taken, not against the owner or owners personally. That is why
eminent

domain cases often have names like United States v. 564.54
Acres of Land, 441 U.S. 506 (1979) or 275.81 Acres of Land, More or Less,
Situated

in Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania, 2014
WL 1248205 (W.D. Pa. 2014). Eminent domain is deeply unsettling to property

owners, especially if the condemnation involves the forced
exchange of a fee simple or long-term lease which forms the basis for the

condemnee’s home or business. Recent experience suggests
that takings of property by eminent domain are likely to encounter more
resistance

from property owners than is regulation of the uses of
property, by zoning for example.

When does the government—or an entity exercising a delegated
power of eminent domain—seek to condemn property? As a matter of

practice, it is clear that eminent domain is used as an
alternative to the purchase of some recognized interest in property, like a fee
simple, a lease,

or an easement. In theory, eminent domain could be used to
acquire almost anything, like a pleasant view from a window or an individual’s
labor.

(The military draft represents a forced acquisition of
individual labor—and potentially life—but the government power of military
conscription is

viewed as distinct from eminent domain and does not include
a just compensation requirement.) In nearly every case in which eminent domain
is

used, the government or other condemning authority starts by
offering to purchase some exchangeable interest in property, like a fee simple,
a

lease or an easement. Often, the condemning authority will
reach an agreement with the owner about a price, and the interest will be
transferred

at this price voluntarily. But if the condemning authority
and the owner cannot agree on a price, the condemning authority will file an
action in

court to compel a transfer of the property. If the court is
satisfied that the legal requirements for the use of eminent domain have been
met, the

court will direct a forced exchange of the relevant interest
in property and determine the price the condemning authority must pay. Bear in
mind,

however, that even if the condemning authority reaches an
agreement with the owner about a price, the bargaining between the condemning

authority and the owner

#1166

will take place under the shadow of eminent domain. Cf.
Goldberg et al., Bargaining in the Shadow of Eminent Domain: Valuing and

Apportioning Condemnation Awards Between Landlord and
Tenant, 34 UCLA L. Rev. 1083 (1987). The owner will know that if push comes to

shove, the condemning authority can force a transfer of the
property and some government entity (usually a court) will determine the price.
This

unquestionably increases the condemning authority’s
bargaining power relative to that of the owner.

Who may exercise the power of eminent domain? The Supreme
Court has held that the power of eminent domain is an inherent attribute of

political sovereignty. PennEast Pipeline Co., LLC v. New
Jersey, 141 S. Ct. 2244, 2254–55 (2021). Thus, the federal government can
exercise the

power of eminent domain, even though that power is not
expressly mentioned in the Constitution and it was not until 1876 that the
Court

recognized a federal power of eminent domain. Kohl v. United
States, 91 U.S. 367, 372 (1876). Before then, when the federal government

wanted to engage in a forced exchange of property, it
generally asked the relevant state to exercise the power of eminent domain, and
then to

transfer the property to the federal government. Compare
William Baude, Rethinking the Federal Eminent Domain Power, 122 Yale L.J. 1738,

1761–77 (2013) (expressing skepticism about whether the
federal government was originally thought to have the power of eminent domain)
with

Christian R. Bursett, The Messy History of the Federal
Eminent Domain Power: A Response to William Baude, 4 Cal. L. Rev. Circuit 187
(2013)

(maintaining that the evidence on this point is mixed). Each
of the states, as part of their reserved sovereign powers not delegated to the
federal

government, also has the power of eminent domain.

Courts have long held that the power of eminent domain can
be delegated by the sovereign (the federal government or the states) to other

entities. This must be done by statute. States have commonly
delegated the power of eminent domain to subordinate governmental bodies like

counties and cities, as well as to state agencies like
highway departments and redevelopment authorities. In the nineteenth century it
was

common for states to delegate eminent domain authority to
corporations chartered to construct canals, turnpikes, and railroads, and it
became an

accepted understanding that these common carriers could be
given such a delegated power of eminent domain. The federal government can also

delegate its eminent domain authority. For example, the
Court in PennEast Pipeline , supra, recently upheld the power of a private
interstate

pipeline company to condemn state-owned land, pursuant to a
delegated power adopted in the Federal Power Act in 1947. Nevertheless, it is

important to remember that only a political sovereign has
inherent authority to engage in takings by eminent domain; anyone else claiming
such

a power must show that it has been delegated by statute.

The use of eminent domain authority is directly constrained
by the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment (quoted above). This provision

#1167

originally applied only to the federal government, Barron v.
Baltimore, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 243 (1833), and because the federal government
rarely

exercised a power of eminent domain before 1876, the
constitutional constraint was rarely invoked. The Court eventually held that
similar

principles apply to the states under the Due Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R.R. Co. v.
Chicago,

166 U.S. 226, 238–39 (1897). Today, the Takings Clause is
understood to be directly incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment, Penn

Central Transp. Co. v. City of New York, 438 U.S. 104, 122
(1978), so the same constraints apply to both the federal government and the
states

as a matter of federal constitutional law. Similarly worded
clauses appear in the state constitutions of nearly all the states. These
federal and state

takings clauses directly constrain the use of eminent domain
by the government. They have also been held to limit the power of government to

adopt regulations of property that have an impact
functionally equivalent to the exercise of eminent domain—the so-called
regulatory takings

doctrine. In both contexts, decisions of the United States
Supreme Court have sought to define limits on the ability of government to
rearrange

property rights or to restrict the uses of property rights
in the name of some public interest.

The Takings Clause is a fitting subject to conclude our
study of property, because the Court, in applying the words of the Clause in
different

contexts, has drawn upon numerous themes and issues covered
throughout the course. These include questions about how we define “property,”

how far property may be unbundled into discrete rights for
purposes of legal analysis, how far claims of owner sovereignty should give way
to

concerns about public or community interests, the
distinction between trespass and nuisance, the difference between possessory
rights and

servitudes, and—perhaps most centrally—how important it is
that the government forbear from frustrating settled expectations about
property.

We start this Part with takings by eminent domain. Because
eminent domain trumps ordinary property rights, the power has always been

viewed with some suspicion in America. Exercises of eminent
domain authority must satisfy both statutory and constitutional requirements.

Statutory requirements vary, but typically the condemning
authority must show that it has been delegated the power of eminent domain by
the

legislature and that the delegated power is broad enough to
encompass the proposed project. Some states require that the exercise of
eminent

domain be shown to be “necessary” to complete the project,
and some states require that the condemning authority show it has made a good
faith

effort to acquire the property by voluntary exchange before
invoking eminent domain. In many states, some types of projects, such as urban

renewal or economic development takings, may include
additional statutory requirements, such as a finding that the property in
question is

“blighted.” The principal constitutional

#1168

requirements are that the project be a “public use” and that
the condemning authority has offered the property owner “just compensation.”
The

Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments
also presumably require notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the issue of

government authority before property is seized, although
surprisingly there is some contrary authority in state courts. See Rhode Island

Economic Development Corp. v. The Parking Company, 892 A.2d
87 (R.I. 2006) (reaffirming state precedent holding that due process does not

require notice or a hearing before property is taken under
expedited “quick take” eminent domain procedures).

### 1 .THE PUBLIC USE REQUIREMENT

One potentially significant constitutional limitation on the
power of eminent domain is that it must be deployed for a “public use.” There

has been much debate about what this means. From the
mid-nineteenth century through the early decades of the twentieth, a number of
state

courts (mostly applying state constitutional provisions)
held that public use means actual “use by the public.” See Philip Nichols, Jr.,
The

Meaning of Public Use in the Law of Eminent Domain, 20 B.U.
L. Rev. 615, 633 (1940). Under this understanding, property could be taken for

highways or parks or railroads that would be used by the
public. But it could not be taken for a private home or factory. This
restrictive view has

never gained favor with the U.S. Supreme Court, however,
which by the time it got around to being clear on the subject has always
construed the

public use requirement in the Fifth Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution to mean public advantage or benefit. See Berman v. Parker, 348
U.S. 26,

33 (1954); Rindge Co. v. Los Angeles County, 262 U.S. 700,
707 (1923). Under this broader interpretation, eminent domain can be used for
any

project that has some public interest rationale. The U.S.
Supreme Court has also said that courts should give great deference to
legislative bodies

in their determinations of what sorts of projects satisfy
the U.S. Constitution’s public use requirement. Hawaii Housing Authority v.
Midkiff, 467

U.S. 229, 241–43 (1984).

Given the Supreme Court’s broad interpretation of the
“public use” language in the Fifth Amendment and its deferential standard of
review,

federal courts have almost never invalidated a taking of
property for failing the public use requirement. State courts applying takings
clauses in

state constitutions are somewhat more likely to say that
some purposes—like a condemnation to create a private access road or to acquire
a

parking lot for a commercial enterprise—are not public uses.
Surveys of appellate decisions in the fifty years after Berman have found that
state

courts presented with public use challenges (nearly always
under state constitutions) invalidated about one of six takings challenged on
this

ground. See Thomas W. Merrill, The Economics of Public Use,
72 Cornell L. Rev. 61, 101 (1986); Corey J. Wilk, The Struggle over the Public

Use Clause: Survey of Holdings and Trends, 1986–2003, 39
Real

#1169

Prop. Prob. & Tr. J. 251, 262 (2004). Still, eminent
domain has been used in recent years for projects that many observers have
found unsettling.

Perhaps the most controversial decision was Poletown
Neighborhood Council v. City of Detroit , 304 N.W.2d 455 (Mich. 1981), which
upheld the

condemnation of 465 acres of property in and near Detroit,
Michigan for retransfer to General Motors for an auto assembly plant. The
“public

use” was said to be the preservation of jobs that would
otherwise leave the city, contributing to a declining industrial and population
base. In

another case, the California Supreme Court left the door
open for the City to argue that eminent domain could be used to condemn the
Oakland

Raiders professional football team, in order to keep it from
leaving the City of Oakland. See City of Oakland v. Oakland Raiders, 646 P.2d
835,

843–44 (Cal. 1982).

At the beginning of the twenty-first century, criticisms of
the use of eminent domain for economic development purposes began to mount. A

number of lower court decisions invalidated exercises of
eminent domain as a means of acquiring real estate for particular commercial
entities.

See, e.g., Southwestern Ill. Dev. Auth. v. National City
Env., L.L.C., 768 N.E.2d 1 (Ill. 2002) (invalidating condemnation of recycling
center for

re-transfer to an auto race track for use as a parking lot);
99 Cents Only Stores v. Lancaster Redevelopment Agency, 237 F. Supp. 2d 1123
(C.D.

Cal. 2 001), appeal dismissed as moot, 60 Fed. Appx. 123
(9th Cir. 2003) (invalidating condemnation of lease in shopping center for
retransfer to

another store for expansion); Casino Reinvestment
Development Authority v. Banin, 727 A.2d 102 (N.J. Super. 1998) (invalidating

condemnation of land for future expansion of a commercial
casino). Perhaps most dramatically, the Michigan Supreme Court overruled its

decision in Poletown , holding that property cannot be
condemned and retransferred to a commercial entity when the sole rationale is
economic

development. See County of Wayne v. Hathcock, 684 N.W.2d 765
(Mich. 2004). The Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm devoted to

protecting private property rights, published a study
collecting thousands of instances of property being condemned for retransfer to
commercial

entities throughout the nation. Dana Berliner, Public Power,
Private Gain (2003). The Institute then convinced the U.S. Supreme Court to
review

one of the cases it had brought on behalf of objecting
landowners in order to revisit the question of the meaning of public use. The
upshot was

the following intensely controversial decision.

#### Kelo v. City of New London, Connecticut

```



Supreme Court of the United States, 2005.



545 U.S. 469.



```

■
JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court. In 2000, the city of New
London approved a development plan that, in the words of the

Supreme Court of Connecticut, was “projected to create in
excess of 1,000 jobs, to increase tax and other revenues, and to revitalize an

economically

#1170

distressed city, including its downtown and waterfront
areas.” 843 A.2d 500, 507 (Conn. 2004). In assembling the land needed for this
project,

the city’s development agent has purchased property from
willing sellers and proposes to use the power of eminent domain to acquire the

remainder of the property from unwilling owners in exchange
for just compensation. The question presented is whether the city’s proposed

disposition of this property qualifies as a “public use”
within the meaning of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution.

I

The city of New London (hereinafter City) sits at the
junction of the Thames River and the Long Island Sound in southeastern
Connecticut.

Decades of economic decline led a state agency in 1990 to
designate the City a “distressed municipality.” In 1996, the Federal Government

closed the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, which had been
located in the Fort Trumbull area of the City and had employed over 1,500
people. In

1998, the City’s unemployment rate was nearly double that of
the State, and its population of just under 24,000 residents was at its lowest
since

These conditions prompted state and local officials to
target New London, and particularly its Fort Trumbull area, for economic

revitalization. To this end, respondent New London
Development Corporation (NLDC), a private nonprofit entity established some
years earlier

to assist the City in planning economic development, was
reactivated. In January 1998, the State authorized a $5.35 million bond issue
to support

the NLDC’s planning activities and a $10 million bond issue
toward the creation of a Fort Trumbull State Park. In February, the
pharmaceutical

company Pfizer Inc. announced that it would build a $300
million research facility on a site immediately adjacent to Fort Trumbull;
local

planners hoped that Pfizer would draw new business to the
area, thereby serving as a catalyst to the area’s rejuvenation. After receiving
initial

approval from the city council, the NLDC continued its
planning activities and held a series of neighborhood meetings to educate the
public

about the process. In May, the city council authorized the
NLDC to formally submit its plans to the relevant state agencies for review.
Upon

obtaining state-level approval, the NLDC finalized an
integrated development plan focused on 90 acres of the Fort Trumbull area.

The Fort Trumbull area is situated on a peninsula that juts
into the Thames River. The area comprises approximately 115 privately owned

properties, as well as the 32 acres of land formerly
occupied by the naval facility (Trumbull State Park now occupies 18 of those 32
acres). The

development plan encompasses seven parcels. Parcel 1 is
designated for a waterfront conference hotel at the center of a “small urban
village” that

will include restaurants and shopping. This parcel will also
have marinas for both recreational and commercial uses. A pedestrian
“riverwalk”

will originate here and continue down the coast, connecting
the waterfront areas of the development. Parcel 2 will be the site of
approximately 80

#1171

new residences organized into an urban neighborhood and
linked by public walkway to the remainder of the development, including the
state

park. This parcel also includes space reserved for a new
U.S. Coast Guard Museum. Parcel 3, which is located immediately north of the
Pfizer

facility, will contain at least 90,000 square feet of
research and development office space. Parcel 4A is a 2.4-acre site that will
be used either to

support the adjacent state park, by providing parking or
retail services for visitors, or to support the nearby marina. Parcel 4B will
include a

renovated marina, as well as the final stretch of the
riverwalk. Parcels 5, 6, and 7 will provide land for office and retail space,
parking, and water-

dependent commercial uses.

The NLDC intended the development plan to capitalize on the
arrival of the Pfizer facility and the new commerce it was expected to attract.

In addition to creating jobs, generating tax revenue, and
helping to “build momentum for the revitalization of downtown New London,” the
plan

was also designed to make the City more attractive and to
create leisure and recreational opportunities on the waterfront and in the
park.

The city council approved the plan in January 2000, and
designated the NLDC as its development agent in charge of implementation. See

Conn. Gen.Stat. § 8–188 (2005). The city council also
authorized the NLDC to purchase property or to acquire property by exercising
eminent

domain in the City’s name. § 8–193. The NLDC successfully
negotiated the purchase of most of the real estate in the 90-acre area, but its

negotiations with petitioners failed. As a consequence, in
November 2000, the NLDC initiated the condemnation proceedings that gave rise
to

this case.

II

Petitioner Susette Kelo has lived in the Fort Trumbull area
since 1997. She has made extensive improvements to her house, which she prizes

for its water view. Petitioner Wilhelmina Dery was born in
her Fort Trumbull house in 1918 and has lived there her entire life. Her
husband

Charles (also a petitioner) has lived in the house since
they married some 60 years ago. In all, the nine petitioners own 15 properties
in Fort

Trumbull—4 in parcel 3 of the development plan and 11 in
parcel 4A. Ten of the parcels are occupied by the owner or a family member; the

other five are held as investment properties. There is no
allegation that any of these properties is blighted or otherwise in poor
condition; rather,

they were condemned only because they happen to be located
in the development area.

In December 2000, petitioners brought this action in the New
London Superior Court. They claimed, among other things, that the taking of

their properties would violate the “public use” restriction
in the Fifth Amendment. After a 7-day bench trial, the Superior Court granted a

permanent restraining order prohibiting the taking of the
properties

#1172

located in parcel 4A (park or marina support). It, however,
denied petitioners relief as to the properties located in parcel 3 (office
space).^4

After the Superior Court ruled, both sides took appeals to
the Supreme Court of Connecticut. That court held, over a dissent, that all of
the

City’s proposed takings were valid. * * *

We granted certiorari to determine whether a city’s decision
to take property for the purpose of economic development satisfies the “public

use” requirement of the Fifth Amendment.

III

Two polar propositions are perfectly clear. On the one hand,
it has long been accepted that the sovereign may not take the property of A for

the sole purpose of transferring it to another private party
B, even though A is paid just compensation. On the other hand, it is equally
clear that a

State may transfer property from one private party to
another if future “use by the public” is the purpose of the taking; the
condemnation of land

for a railroad with common-carrier duties is a familiar
example. Neither

#1173

of these propositions, however, determines the disposition
of this case. * * *

The disposition of this case therefore turns on the question
whether the City’s development plan serves a “public purpose.” Without

exception, our cases have defined that concept broadly,
reflecting our longstanding policy of deference to legislative judgments in
this field.

In Berman v. Parker , 348 U.S. 26 (1954), this Court upheld
a redevelopment plan targeting a blighted area of Washington, D.C., in which

most of the housing for the area’s 5,000 inhabitants was
beyond repair. Under the plan, the area would be condemned and part of it
utilized for

the construction of streets, schools, and other public
facilities. The remainder of the land would be leased or sold to private
parties for the

purpose of redevelopment, including the construction of
low-cost housing.

The owner of a department store located in the area
challenged the condemnation, pointing out that his store was not itself
blighted and

arguing that the creation of a “better balanced, more
attractive community” was not a valid public use. Id., at 31. Writing for a
unanimous Court,

Justice Douglas refused to evaluate this claim in isolation,
deferring instead to the legislative and agency judgment that the area “must be
planned

as a whole” for the plan to be successful. Id., at 34. The
Court explained that “community redevelopment programs need not, by force of
the

Constitution, be on a piecemeal basis—lot by lot, building
by building.” Id., at 35. The public use underlying the taking was
unequivocally

affirmed:

#1174

We do not sit to determine whether a particular housing
project is or is not desirable. The concept of the public welfare is broad and

inclusive.... The values it represents are spiritual as well
as physical, aesthetic as well as monetary. It is within the power of the

legislature to determine that the community should be
beautiful as well as healthy, spacious as well as clean, well-balanced as well
as

carefully patrolled. In the present case, the Congress and
its authorized agencies have made determinations that take into account a

wide variety of values. It is not for us to reappraise them.
If those who govern the District of Columbia decide that the Nation’s Capital

should be beautiful as well as sanitary, there is nothing in
the Fifth Amendment that stands in the way. Id., at 33.

In Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 (1984),
the Court considered a Hawaii statute whereby fee title was taken from

lessors and transferred to lessees (for just compensation)
in order to reduce the concentration of land ownership. We unanimously upheld
the

statute and rejected the Ninth Circuit’s view that it was “a
naked attempt on the part of the state of Hawaii to take the property of A and
transfer it

to B solely for B’s private use and benefit.” Id., at 235
(internal quotation marks omitted). Reaffirming Berman’s deferential approach
to

legislative judgments in this field, we concluded that the
State’s purpose of eliminating the “social and economic evils of a land
oligopoly”

qualified as a valid public use. 467 U.S., at 241–242. Our
opinion also rejected the contention that the mere fact that the State
immediately

transferred the properties to private individuals upon
condemnation somehow diminished the public character of the taking. “[I]t is
only the

taking’s purpose, and not its mechanics,” we explained, that
matters in determining public use. Id., at 244. * * *

Viewed as a whole, our jurisprudence has recognized that the
needs of society have varied between different parts of the Nation, just as
they

have evolved over time in response to changed circumstances.

* * * For more than a century, our public use jurisprudence has wisely eschewed

rigid formulas and intrusive scrutiny in favor of affording
legislatures broad latitude in determining what public needs justify the use of
the

takings power.

IV

Those who govern the City were not confronted with the need
to remove blight in the Fort Trumbull area, but their determination that the

area was sufficiently distressed to justify a program of
economic rejuvenation is entitled to our deference. The City has carefully
formulated an

economic development plan that it believes will provide
appreciable benefits to the community, including—but by no means limited to—new

jobs and increased tax revenue. As with other exercises in
urban planning and development, the City is endeavoring to coordinate a variety
of

commercial, residential, and recreational uses of

#1175

land, with the hope that they will form a whole greater than
the sum of its parts. To effectuate this plan, the City has invoked a state
statute that

specifically authorizes the use of eminent domain to promote
economic development. Given the comprehensive character of the plan, the

thorough deliberation that preceded its adoption, and the
limited scope of our review, it is appropriate for us, as it was in Berman, to
resolve the

challenges of the individual owners, not on a piecemeal
basis, but rather in light of the entire plan. Because that plan unquestionably
serves a

public purpose, the takings challenged here satisfy the
public use requirement of the Fifth Amendment.

To avoid this result, petitioners urge us to adopt a new
bright-line rule that economic development does not qualify as a public use.
Putting

aside the unpersuasive suggestion that the City’s plan will
provide only purely economic benefits, neither precedent nor logic supports

petitioners’ proposal. Promoting economic development is a
traditional and long accepted function of government. There is, moreover, no

principled way of distinguishing economic development from
the other public purposes that we have recognized. * * * [I]n Berman, we
endorsed

the purpose of transforming a blighted area into a
“well-balanced” community through redevelopment, 348 U.S., at 33;^13 in
Midkiff, we upheld

the interest in breaking up a land oligopoly that “created
artificial deterrents to the normal functioning of the State’s residential land
market,” 467

U.S., at 242; and in [Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S.
986 (1984)], we accepted Congress’ purpose of eliminating a “significant
barrier to

entry in the pesticide market,” 467 U.S., at 1014–1015. It
would be incongruous to hold that the City’s interest in the economic benefits
to be

derived from the development of the Fort Trumbull area has
less of a public character than any of those other interests. Clearly, there is
no basis

for exempting economic development from our traditionally
broad understanding of public purpose.

Petitioners contend that using eminent domain for economic
development impermissibly blurs the boundary between public and private

takings. Again, our cases foreclose this objection. Quite
simply, the government’s pursuit of a public purpose will often benefit
individual private

parties. For example, in Midkiff, the forced transfer of
property conferred a direct and significant benefit on those lessees who were
previously

unable to purchase their homes. In Monsanto, we recognized

#1176

that the “most direct beneficiaries” of the data-sharing
provisions were the subsequent pesticide applicants, but benefiting them in
this way was

necessary to promoting competition in the pesticide market.
467 U.S., at 1014. The owner of the department store in Berman objected to
“taking

from one businessman for the benefit of another
businessman,” 348 U.S., at 33, referring to the fact that under the
redevelopment plan land

would be leased or sold to private developers for
redevelopment. Our rejection of that contention has particular relevance to the
instant case:

“The public end may be as well or better served through an
agency of private enterprise than through a department of government—or so the

Congress might conclude. We cannot say that public ownership
is the sole method of promoting the public purposes of community

redevelopment projects.” Id., at 34.^16

It is further argued that without a bright-line rule nothing
would stop a city from transferring citizen A ’s property to citizen B for the
sole

reason that citizen B will put the property to a more
productive use and thus pay more taxes. Such a one-to-one transfer of property,
executed

outside the confines of an integrated development plan, is
not presented in this case. While such an unusual exercise of government power
would

certainly raise a suspicion that a private purpose was
afoot,^17 the hypothetical cases posited by petitioners can be confronted if
and when they

arise.^18 They do not warrant the crafting of an artificial
restriction on the concept of public use.

Alternatively, petitioners maintain that for takings of this
kind we should require a “reasonable certainty” that the expected public
benefits

will actually accrue. Such a rule, however, would represent
an even greater departure from our precedent. “When the legislature’s purpose
is

legitimate and its means are not irrational, our cases make
clear that empirical debates over the wisdom of takings—no less than debates
over the

wisdom of other kinds of socioeconomic legislation—are not
to be carried out in the federal courts.” Midkiff, 467 U.S., at 242. * * * The

disadvantages of a heightened form of review are especially
pronounced

#1177

in this type of case. Orderly implementation of a
comprehensive redevelopment plan obviously requires that the legal rights of
all interested

parties be established before new construction can be
commenced. A constitutional rule that required postponement of the judicial
approval of

every condemnation until the likelihood of success of the
plan had been assured would unquestionably impose a significant impediment to
the

successful consummation of many such plans.

Just as we decline to second-guess the City’s considered
judgments about the efficacy of its development plan, we also decline to
second-

guess the City’s determinations as to what lands it needs to
acquire in order to effectuate the project. “It is not for the courts to
oversee the choice

of the boundary line nor to sit in review on the size of a
particular project area. Once the question of the public purpose has been
decided, the

amount and character of land to be taken for the project and
the need for a particular tract to complete the integrated plan rests in the
discretion of

the legislative branch.” Berman, 348 U.S., at 35–36.

In affirming the City’s authority to take petitioners’
properties, we do not minimize the hardship that condemnations may entail,

notwithstanding the payment of just compensation. We
emphasize that nothing in our opinion precludes any State from placing further

restrictions on its exercise of the takings power. Indeed,
many States already impose “public use” requirements that are stricter than the
federal

baseline. Some of these requirements have been established
as a matter of state constitutional law,^22 while others are expressed in state
eminent

domain statutes that carefully limit the grounds upon which
takings may be exercised.^23 As the submissions of the parties and their amici
make

clear, the necessity and wisdom of using eminent domain to
promote economic development are certainly matters of legitimate public
debate.^24

This Court’s authority, however, extends only to determining
whether the City’s proposed condemnations are for a “public use” within the

meaning of the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.
Because over a century of our case law interpreting that provision dictates an

affirmative answer to that question, we may not grant
petitioners the relief that they seek.

#1178

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Connecticut is
affirmed.

It is so ordered.

■
JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring. I join the opinion for the Court and add these
further observations. * * *

A court applying rational-basis review under the Public Use
Clause should strike down a taking that, by a clear showing, is intended to

favor a particular private party, with only incidental or
pretextual public benefits, just as a court applying rational-basis review
under the Equal

Protection Clause must strike down a government
classification that is clearly intended to injure a particular class of private
parties, with only

incidental or pretextual public justifications. See Cleburne
v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 446–447, 450 (1985); Department
of

Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 533–536 (1973). * * *

A court confronted with a plausible accusation of
impermissible favoritism to private parties should treat the objection as a
serious one and

review the record to see if it has merit, though with the
presumption that the government’s actions were reasonable and intended to serve
a public

purpose. Here, the trial court conducted a careful and
extensive inquiry into “whether, in fact, the development plan is of primary
benefit to...

the developer [ i.e., Corcoran Jennison], and private
businesses which may eventually locate in the plan area [ e.g., Pfizer], and in
that regard, only

of incidental benefit to the city.” The trial court
considered testimony from government officials and corporate officers;
documentary evidence of

communications between these parties ; respondents’
awareness of New London’s depressed economic condition and evidence
corroborating the

validity of this concern; the substantial commitment of
public funds by the State to the development project before most of the private

beneficiaries were known; evidence that respondents reviewed
a variety of development plans and chose a private developer from a group of

applicants rather than picking out a particular transferee
beforehand; and the fact that the other private beneficiaries of the project
are still

unknown because the office space proposed to be built has
not yet been rented.

The trial court concluded, based on these findings, that
benefiting Pfizer was not “the primary motivation or effect of this development

plan”; instead, “the primary motivation for [respondents]
was to take advantage of Pfizer’s presence.” Likewise, the trial court
concluded that

“[t]here is nothing in the record to indicate that...
[respondents] were motivated by a desire to aid [other] particular private
entities.” Even the

dissenting justices on the Connecticut Supreme Court agreed
that respondents’ development plan was intended to revitalize the local
economy,

not to serve the interests of Pfizer, Corcoran Jennison, or
any other private party. 843 A.2d 500, 595 (Conn. 2004) (Zarella, J.,
concurring in part

and dissenting in part). This case, then, survives the
meaningful rational basis review that in my view is required under the Public
Use Clause.

---

#1179

■
JUSTICE O’CONNOR, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE
THOMAS join, dissenting. Over two centuries ago, just after the

Bill of Rights was ratified, Justice Chase wrote:

An ACT of the Legislature (for I cannot call it a law)
contrary to the great first principles of the social compact, cannot be
considered a

rightful exercise of legislative authority.... A few
instances will suffice to explain what I mean.... [A] law that takes property
from

A. and gives it to B: It is against all reason and justice,
for a people to entrust a Legislature with SUCH powers; and, therefore, it

cannot be presumed that they have done it. Calder v. Bull, 3
Dall. 386, 388 (1798) (emphasis deleted).

Today the Court abandons this long-held, basic limitation on
government power. Under the banner of economic development, all private

property is now vulnerable to being taken and transferred to
another private owner, so long as it might be upgraded— i.e., given to an owner
who

will use it in a way that the legislature deems more
beneficial to the public—in the process. To reason, as the Court does, that the
incidental

public benefits resulting from the subsequent ordinary use
of private property render economic development takings “for public use” is to
wash

out any distinction between private and public use of
property—and thereby effectively to delete the words “for public use” from the
Takings

Clause of the Fifth Amendment. * * *

II

* * * [W]e have read the Fifth Amendment’s language to
      impose two distinct conditions on the exercise of eminent domain: “the taking

must be for a ‘public use’ and ‘just compensation’ must be
paid to the owner.” Brown v. Legal Foundation of Wash., 538 U.S. 216, 231–232

(2003).

These two limitations serve to protect “the security of
Property,” which Alexander Hamilton described to the Philadelphia Convention as

one of the “great obj[ects] of Gov[ernment].” 1 Records of
the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 302 (M. Farrand ed. 1934). Together they
ensure

stable property ownership by providing safeguards against
excessive, unpredictable, or unfair use of the government’s eminent domain
power—

particularly against those owners who, for whatever reasons,
may be unable to protect themselves in the political process against the
majority’s

will.

While the Takings Clause presupposes that government can
take private property without the owner’s consent, the just compensation

requirement spreads the cost of condemnations and thus
“prevents the public from loading upon one individual more than his just share
of the

burdens of government.” Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United
States, 148 U.S. 312, 325 (1893); see also Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S.
40,

49 (1960). The public use requirement, in turn, imposes a
more basic limitation, circumscribing the very scope of the eminent domain
power:

#1180

Government may compel an individual to forfeit her property
for the public’s use, but not for the benefit of another private person. This

requirement promotes fairness as well as security.

Where is the line between “public” and “private” property
use? We give considerable deference to legislatures’ determinations about what

governmental activities will advantage the public. But were
the political branches the sole arbiters of the public-private distinction, the
Public

Use Clause would amount to little more than hortatory fluff.
An external, judicial check on how the public use requirement is interpreted,

however limited, is necessary if this constraint on
government power is to retain any meaning. See Cincinnati v. Vester, 281 U.S.
439, 446 (1930)

(“It is well established that... the question [of] what is a
public use is a judicial one”).

Our cases have generally identified three categories of
takings that comply with the public use requirement, though it is in the nature
of

things that the boundaries between these categories are not
always firm. Two are relatively straightforward and uncontroversial. First, the

sovereign may transfer private property to public
ownership—such as for a road, a hospital, or a military base. Second, the
sovereign may

transfer private property to private parties, often common
carriers, who make the property available for the public’s use—such as with a
railroad,

a public utility, or a stadium. But “public ownership” and
“use-by-the-public” are sometimes too constricting and impractical ways to
define the

scope of the Public Use Clause. Thus we have allowed that,
in certain circumstances and to meet certain exigencies, takings that serve a
public

purpose also satisfy the Constitution even if the property
is destined for subsequent private use. See, e.g., Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S.
26 (1954);

Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 (1984).

This case returns us for the first time in over 20 years to
the hard question of when a purportedly “public purpose” taking meets the
public

use requirement. It presents an issue of first impression:
Are economic development takings constitutional? I would hold that they are
not. * * *

In [ Berman and Midkiff ] we emphasized the importance of
deferring to legislative judgments about public purpose. Because courts are
ill-

equipped to evaluate the efficacy of proposed legislative
initiatives, we rejected as unworkable the idea of courts’ “ ‘deciding on what
is and is

not a governmental function and... invalidating legislation
on the basis of their view on that question at the moment of decision, a
practice

which has proved impracticable in other fields.’ ” Id., at
240–241 (quoting United States ex rel. TVA v. Welch, 327 U.S. 546, 552 (1946));
see

Berman, supra, at 32 (“[T]he legislature, not the judiciary,
is the main guardian of the public needs to be served by social legislation”).
Likewise,

we recognized our inability to evaluate whether, in a given
case, eminent domain is a necessary means by which to pursue the legislature’s
ends.

Midkiff, supra, at 242; Berman, supra, at 103.

#1181

Yet for all the emphasis on deference, Berman and Midkiff
hewed to a bedrock principle without which our public use jurisprudence would

collapse: “A purely private taking could not withstand the
scrutiny of the public use requirement; it would serve no legitimate purpose of

government and would thus be void.” Midkiff, supra, at 245.
To protect that principle, those decisions reserved “a role for courts to play
in

reviewing a legislature’s judgment of what constitutes a
public use... [though] the Court in Berman made clear that it is ‘an extremely
narrow’

one.” Midkiff, supra, at 240 (quoting Berman, supra, at 32).

The Court’s holdings in Berman and Midkiff were true to the
principle underlying the Public Use Clause. In both those cases, the

extraordinary, precondemnation use of the targeted property
inflicted affirmative harm on society—in Berman through blight resulting from

extreme poverty and in Midkiff through oligopoly resulting
from extreme wealth. And in both cases, the relevant legislative body had found
that

eliminating the existing property use was necessary to
remedy the harm. Berman, supra, at 28–29; Midkiff, supra, at 232. Thus a public
purpose

was realized when the harmful use was eliminated. Because
each taking directly achieved a public benefit, it did not matter that the
property was

turned over to private use. Here, in contrast, New London
does not claim that Susette Kelo’s and Wilhelmina Dery’s well-maintained homes
are

the source of any social harm. Indeed, it could not so claim
without adopting the absurd argument that any single-family home that might be

razed to make way for an apartment building, or any church
that might be replaced with a retail store, or any small business that might be
more

lucrative if it were instead part of a national franchise,
is inherently harmful to society and thus within the government’s power to
condemn.

In moving away from our decisions sanctioning the
condemnation of harmful property use, the Court today significantly expands the

meaning of public use. It holds that the sovereign may take
private property currently put to ordinary private use, and give it over for
new,

ordinary private use, so long as the new use is predicted to
generate some secondary benefit for the public—such as increased tax revenue,
more

jobs, maybe even aesthetic pleasure. But nearly any lawful
use of real private property can be said to generate some incidental benefit to
the

public. Thus, if predicted (or even guaranteed) positive
side-effects are enough to render transfer from one private party to another
constitutional,

then the words “for public use” do not realistically exclude
any takings, and thus do not exert any constraint on the eminent domain power.

There is a sense in which this troubling result follows from
errant language in Berman and Midkiff. In discussing whether takings within a

blighted neighborhood were for a public use, Berman began by
observing: “We deal, in other words, with what traditionally has been known as

the police power.” 348 U.S., at 32. From there it declared
that

#1182

“[o]nce the object is within the authority of Congress, the
right to realize it through the exercise of eminent domain is clear.” Id., at
33. Following

up, we said in Midkiff that “[t]he ‘public use’ requirement
is coterminous with the scope of a sovereign’s police powers.” 467 U.S., at
240. This

language was unnecessary to the specific holdings of those
decisions. Berman and Midkiff simply did not put such language to the
constitutional

test, because the takings in those cases were within the
police power but also for “public use” for the reasons I have described. The
case before us

now demonstrates why, when deciding if a taking’s purpose is
constitutional, the police power and “public use” cannot always be equated. The

Court protests that it does not sanction the bare transfer
from A to B for B’s benefit. It suggests two limitations on what can be taken
after today’s

decision. First, it maintains a role for courts in ferreting
out takings whose sole purpose is to bestow a benefit on the private
transferee—without

detailing how courts are to conduct that complicated
inquiry. For his part, Justice KENNEDY suggests that courts may divine illicit
purpose by a

careful review of the record and the process by which a
legislature arrived at the decision to take—without specifying what courts
should look

for in a case with different facts, how they will know if
they have found it, and what to do if they do not. Whatever the details of
Justice

KENNEDY’s as-yet-undisclosed test, it is difficult to
envision anyone but the “stupid staff[er]” failing it. See Lucas v. South
Carolina Coastal

Council, 505 U.S. 1003 , 1025–1026, n. 12 (1992). The
trouble with economic development takings is that private benefit and
incidental public

benefit are, by definition, merged and mutually reinforcing.
In this case, for example, any boon for Pfizer or the plan’s developer is
difficult to

disaggregate from the promised public gains in taxes and
jobs.

Even if there were a practical way to isolate the motives
behind a given taking, the gesture toward a purpose test is theoretically
flawed. If it

is true that incidental public benefits from new private use
are enough to ensure the “public purpose” in a taking, why should it matter, as
far as

the Fifth Amendment is concerned, what inspired the taking
in the first place? How much the government does or does not desire to benefit
a

favored private party has no bearing on whether an economic
development taking will or will not generate secondary benefit for the public.
And

whatever the reason for a given condemnation, the effect is
the same from the constitutional perspective—private property is forcibly

relinquished to new private ownership.

A second proposed limitation is implicit in the Court’s
opinion. The logic of today’s decision is that eminent domain may only be used
to

upgrade—not downgrade—property. At best this makes the
Public Use Clause redundant with the Due Process Clause, which already
prohibits

irrational government action. The Court rightfully admits,
however, that the judiciary cannot get bogged down in predictive judgments
about

whether the public will actually be better off after a
property transfer. In

#1183

any event, this constraint has no realistic import. For who
among us can say she already makes the most productive or attractive possible
use of

her property? The specter of condemnation hangs over all
property. Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a
Ritz-

Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a
factory. Cf. Institute for Justice, D. Berliner, Public Power, Private Gain: A
Five-

Year, State-by-State Report Examining the Abuse of Eminent
Domain (2003) (collecting accounts of economic development takings).

The Court also puts special emphasis on facts peculiar to
this case: The NLDC’s plan is the product of a relatively careful deliberative

process; it proposes to use eminent domain for a multipart,
integrated plan rather than for isolated property transfer; it promises an
array of

incidental benefits (even aesthetic ones), not just
increased tax revenue; it comes on the heels of a legislative determination
that New London is a

depressed municipality. Justice KENNEDY, too, takes great
comfort in these facts. But none has legal significance to blunt the force of
today’s

holding. If legislative prognostications about the secondary
public benefits of a new use can legitimate a taking, there is nothing in the
Court’s

rule or in Justice KENNEDY’s gloss on that rule to prohibit
property transfers generated with less care, that are less comprehensive, that
happen

to result from less elaborate process, whose only projected
advantage is the incidence of higher taxes, or that hope to transform an
already

prosperous city into an even more prosperous one.

Finally, in a coda, the Court suggests that property owners
should turn to the States, who may or may not choose to impose appropriate

limits on economic development takings. This is an
abdication of our responsibility. States play many important functions in our
system of dual

sovereignty, but compensating for our refusal to enforce
properly the Federal Constitution (and a provision meant to curtail state
action, no less)

is not among them.

---

It was possible after Berman and Midkiff to imagine
unconstitutional transfers from A to B. Those decisions endorsed government

intervention when private property use had veered to such an
extreme that the public was suffering as a consequence. Today nearly all real

property is susceptible to condemnation on the Court’s
theory. * * *

Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another
private party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random. The

beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with
disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large
corporations and

development firms. As for the victims, the government now
has license to transfer property from those with fewer resources to those with
more.

The Founders cannot have intended this perverse result.
“[T]hat alone is a just government,” wrote James Madison, “which impartially
secures to

every man, whatever is his own. ” For the National Gazette,

#1184

Property, (Mar. 29, 1792), reprinted in 14 Papers of James
Madison 266 (R. Rutland et al. eds. 1983).

I would hold that the takings in both Parcel 3 and Parcel 4A
are unconstitutional, reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of

Connecticut, and remand for further proceedings.

■
JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting. * * * Today’s decision is simply the latest in a
string of our cases construing the Public Use Clause to be a virtual

nullity, without the slightest nod to its original meaning.
In my view, the Public Use Clause, originally understood, is a meaningful limit
on the

government’s eminent domain power. Our cases have strayed
from the Clause’s original meaning, and I would reconsider them.

I

* * * Though one component of the protection provided by the
      Takings Clause is that the government can take private property only if it

provides “just compensation” for the taking, the Takings
Clause also prohibits the government from taking property except “for public
use.”

Were it otherwise, the Takings Clause would either be
meaningless or empty. If the Public Use Clause served no function other than to
state that

the government may take property through its eminent domain
power—for public or private uses—then it would be surplusage. * * *

Alternatively, the Clause could distinguish those takings
that require compensation from those that do not. That interpretation, however,
“would

permit private property to be taken or appropriated for
private use without any compensation whatever.” Cole v. La Grange, 113 U.S. 1,
8 (1885)

(interpreting same language in the Missouri Public Use
Clause). In other words, the Clause would require the government to compensate
for

takings done “for public use,” leaving it free to take
property for purely private uses without the payment of compensation. This
would contradict

a bedrock principle well established by the time of the
founding: that all takings required the payment of compensation. 1 Blackstone
135; 2 J.

Kent, Commentaries on American Law 275 (1827) (hereinafter
Kent); J. Madison, for the National Property Gazette, (Mar. 27, 1792), in 14

Papers of James Madison 266, 267 (R. Rutland et al. eds.
1983) (arguing that no property “shall be taken directly even for public use
without

indemnification to the owner”). The Public Use Clause, like
the Just Compensation Clause, is therefore an express limit on the government’s

power of eminent domain.

The most natural reading of the Clause is that it allows the
government to take property only if the government owns, or the public has a

legal right to use, the property, as opposed to taking it
for any public purpose or necessity whatsoever. At the time of the founding,
dictionaries

primarily defined the noun “use” as “[t]he act of employing
any thing to any purpose.” 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language
2194

(4th ed. 1773). The term “use,” moreover, “is from the Latin
utor, which means ‘to use, make use of, avail one’s self of, employ, apply,
enjoy,

etc.’ ” J. Lewis, Law of Eminent Domain § 165, p. 224, n. 4

#1185

(1888) (hereinafter Lewis). When the government takes
property and gives it to a private individual, and the public has no right to
use the

property, it strains language to say that the public is
“employing” the property, regardless of the incidental benefits that might
accrue to the public

from the private use. The term “public use,” then, means
that either the government or its citizens as a whole must actually “employ”
the taken

property. See id., at 223 (reviewing founding-era
dictionaries). * * *

Tellingly, the phrase “public use” contrasts with the very
different phrase “general Welfare” used elsewhere in the Constitution. See
ibid.

(“Congress shall have Power To... provide for the common
Defence and general Welfare of the United States”); preamble (Constitution

established “to promote the general Welfare”). The Framers
would have used some such broader term if they had meant the Public Use Clause
to

have a similarly sweeping scope. * * *

II

Early American eminent domain practice largely bears out
this understanding of the Public Use Clause. This practice concerns state
limits

on eminent domain power, not the Fifth Amendment, since it
was not until the late 19th century that the Federal Government began to use
the

power of eminent domain, and since the Takings Clause did
not even arguably limit state power until after the passage of the Fourteenth

Amendment. See Note, The Public Use Limitation on Eminent
Domain: An Advance Requiem, 58 Yale L.J. 599, 599–600, and nn. 3–4 (1949);

Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243,
250–251 (1833) (holding the Takings Clause inapplicable to the States of its
own

force). Nevertheless, several early state constitutions at
the time of the founding likewise limited the power of eminent domain to
“public uses.”

Their practices therefore shed light on the original meaning
of the same words contained in the Public Use Clause.

States employed the eminent domain power to provide
quintessentially public goods, such as public roads, toll roads, ferries,
canals,

railroads, and public parks. Lewis §§ 166, 168 –171, 175, at
227–228, 234–241, 243. Though use of the eminent domain power was sparse at the

time of the founding, many States did have so-called Mill
Acts, which authorized the owners of grist mills operated by water power to
flood

upstream lands with the payment of compensation to the
upstream landowner. See, e.g., id., § 178, at 245–246; Head v. Amoskeag Mfg.
Co., 113

U.S. 9, 16–19, and n. 2 (1885). Those early grist mills
“were regulated by law and compelled to serve the public for a stipulated toll
and in

regular order,” and therefore were actually used by the
public. Lewis § 178, at 246, and n. 3 ; see also Head, supra, at 18–19. They
were common

carriers—quasi-public entities. These were “public uses” in
the fullest sense of the word, because the public could legally use and benefit
from

them equally. See Public Use Limitations 903 (common-carrier
status traditionally afforded to “private beneficiaries of a state franchise or

#1186

another form of state monopoly, or to companies that
operated in conditions of natural monopoly”).

To be sure, some early state legislatures tested the limits
of their state-law eminent domain power. Some States enacted statutes allowing
the

taking of property for the purpose of building private
roads. See Lewis § 167, at 230. These statutes were mixed; some required the
private

landowner to keep the road open to the public, and others
did not. See id., § 167, at 230–234. Later in the 19th century, moreover, the
Mill Acts

were employed to grant rights to private manufacturing
plants, in addition to grist mills that had common-carrier duties. See, e.g.,
M. Horwitz,

The Transformation of American Law 1780–1860, pp. 51–52
(1977).

These early uses of the eminent domain power are often cited
as evidence for the broad “public purpose” interpretation of the Public Use

Clause, but in fact the constitutionality of these exercises
of eminent domain power under state public use restrictions was a hotly
contested

question in state courts throughout the 19th and into the
20th century. Some courts construed those clauses to authorize takings for
public

purposes, but others adhered to the natural meaning of
‘‘public use.” As noted above, the earliest Mill Acts were applied to entities
with duties to

remain open to the public, and their later extension is not
deeply probative of whether that subsequent practice is consistent with the
original

meaning of the Public Use Clause. See McIntyre v. Ohio
Elections Comm’n, 514 U.S. 334, 370 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring in
judgment). At

the time of the founding, “[b]usiness corporations were only
beginning to upset the old corporate model, in which the raison d’être of
chartered

associations was their service to the public,” Horwitz,
supra, at 49–50, so it was natural to those who framed the first Public Use
Clauses to think

of mills as inherently public entities. The disagreement
among state courts, and state legislatures’ attempts to circumvent public use
limits on

their eminent domain power, cannot obscure that the Public
Use Clause is most naturally read to authorize takings for public use only if
the

government or the public actually uses the taken property. *

IV

The consequences of today’s decision are not difficult to
predict, and promise to be harmful. So-called “urban renewal” programs provide

some compensation for the properties they take, but no
compensation is possible for the subjective value of these lands to the
individuals

displaced and the indignity inflicted by uprooting them from
their homes. Allowing the government to take property solely for public
purposes is

bad enough, but extending the concept of public purpose to
encompass any economically beneficial goal guarantees that these losses will
fall

disproportionately on poor communities. Those communities
are not only systematically less likely to put their lands to the highest and
best

social use, but are also the least politically powerful. If
ever there were

#1187

justification for intrusive judicial review of
constitutional provisions that protect “discrete and insular minorities,”
United States v. Carolene

Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152, n. 4 (1938), surely that
principle would apply with great force to the powerless groups and individuals
the

Public Use Clause protects. The deferential standard this
Court has adopted for the Public Use Clause is therefore deeply perverse. It
encourages

“those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in
the political process, including large corporations and development firms” to

victimize the weak. Ante, (O’Connor, J., dissenting).

Those incentives have made the legacy of this Court’s
“public purpose” test an unhappy one. In the 1950’s, no doubt emboldened in
part by

the expansive understanding of “public use” this Court
adopted in Berman, cities “rushed to draw plans” for downtown development. B.
Frieden

& L. Sagalyn, Downtown, Inc. How America Rebuilds Cities
17 (1989). “Of all the families displaced by urban renewal from 1949 through

1963, 63 percent of those whose race was known were
nonwhite, and of these families, 56 percent of nonwhites and 38 percent of
whites had

incomes low enough to qualify for public housing, which,
however, was seldom available to them.” Id., at 28. Public works projects in
the 1950’s

and 1960’s destroyed predominantly minority communities in
St. Paul, Minnesota, and Baltimore, Maryland. Id., at 28–29. In 1981 , urban

planners in Detroit, Michigan, uprooted the largely
“lower-income and elderly” Poletown neighborhood for the benefit of the General
Motors

Corporation. J. Wylie, Poletown: Community Betrayed 58
(1989). Urban renewal projects have long been associated with the displacement
of

blacks; “[i]n cities across the country, urban renewal came
to be known as ‘Negro removal.’ ” Pritchett, The “Public Menace” of Blight:
Urban

Renewal and the Private Uses of Eminent Domain, 21 Yale L.
& Pol’y Rev. 1, 47 (2003). Over 97 percent of the individuals forcibly
removed

from their homes by the “slum-clearance” project upheld by
this Court in Berman were black. 348 U.S., at 30. Regrettably, the predictable

consequence of the Court’s decision will be to exacerbate
these effects. * * *

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The decision in _Kelo_ provoked a storm of protest, as
Internet bloggers, editorial writers, and politicians across the country
condemned the

decision as a threat to property rights. The U.S. House of
Representatives passed a resolution expressing its “grave disapproval” of the
decision, and

legislation was introduced in both Houses of Congress and in
virtually every state to discourage or prohibit the use of eminent domain for
economic

development. According to a recent count, 44 states have
adopted new laws or ballot measures in response to the _Kelo_ decision. See
Dana Berliner,

Looking Back Ten Years After _Kelo_ , 125 Yale L.J. Forum 82
( 2015 ). The responses are highly diverse, ranging from broad amendments to
state

constitutions prohibiting any use of eminent domain that
yields a “private use” (New Hampshire) or a transfer to a “private party”
(Nevada), to

```



1188



```

relatively minor adjustments in eminent domain procedures.
See generally, Ilya Somin, The Grasping Hand: _Kelo v. City of New London_ and
the Limits

of Eminent Domain 141 – 64 ( 2015 ). After _Kelo_ , or more
accurately, after the political backlash to _Kelo_ , many state supreme courts
began to rule on state

constitutional grounds that eminent domain cannot be used
for economic development purposes. See, e.g., Norwood v. Horney, 853 N.E. 2 d
1115 (Ohio

2006 ) (holding that under the Ohio Constitution property
cannot be condemned solely for economic development); Board of County Comm’rs
of

Muskogee County v. Lowery, 136 P. 3 d 639 , 653 – 54 (Okla.
2006 ) (holding that economic development is not a public purpose under
Oklahoma law);

Benson v. State, 710 N.W. 2 d 131 , 146 (S.D. 2006 )
(concluding that public use is better understood to require actual use by the
government or the public

rather than public purpose). The New York courts, in
contrast, have adhered to a broad conception of public use that includes some
economic

development projects. See Kaur v. New York State Urban Dev.
Corp., 15 N.Y. 3 d 235 , 933 N.E. 2 d 721 ( 2010 ) (upholding finding of blight
in use of

eminent domain to create Columbia University’s new West
Harlem campus); Develop Don’t Destroy (Brooklyn) v. Urban Dev. Corp., 874
N.Y.S. 2 d 414

(N.Y. App. Div. 2009 ) (upholding use of eminent domain in
creating the Atlantic Yards redevelopment project in Brooklyn). See generally
Somin, supra

at 181 – 203. Overall, the judicial response to _Kelo_ is
consistent with the pre- _Kelo_ historical pattern: more deference to public
use determinations by

federal courts than by state courts, and significant state
variation in the enforcement of the public use limitation. See Lynda J. Oswald,
The Role of

Deference in Judicial Review of Public Use Determinations,
39 B.C. Envtl. Aff. L. Rev. 243 ( 2012 ) (providing a comparative study). What
accounts for

this disuniformity?

2 .What was it about _Kelo_ that generated the profound
backlash? Was it the media accounts of the facts of the case, which were
repeatedly

characterized as involving a taking of occupied (and
nonblighted) residential homes to satisfy the demands of the Pfizer
Corporation? Was it the rhetoric

of Justice O’Connor’s dissent, with its apocalyptic vision
of a world in which every home is up for grabs if coveted by some real estate
developer? Was

it because the public has become increasingly skeptical of
government efforts to intervene in the economy in order to promote economic
growth or job

creation? For a close analysis of the public response to
_Kelo_ , suggesting that contextual variables such as the pre-existing use of
the property and the

identity of the project beneficiary make a large difference
in public attitudes toward eminent domain, see Janice Nadler et al., Government
Takings of

Private Property 286 – 309 , in Public Opinion and
Constitutional Controversy (Nathaniel Persily et al. eds., 2008 ).

3 .For further details about the homeowners in _Kelo_ and
the aftermath of the decision, see Jeff Benedict, Little Pink House: A True
Story of

Defiance and Courage ( 2009 ). Once the Court’s mandate
issued, the judgment of condemnation became final, and legal title to the
properties passed to

the City of New London. Nevertheless, a number of residents,
including Susette Kelo and the Derys, refused to vacate their properties. In
September

2005 , the New London Development Corporation served the

```



1189



```

former owners with eviction notices informing them that if
they did not vacate they would be held liable for rent for holding over in
buildings now

owned by the City. This triggered a new round of public
outcry. Connecticut Governor Jodi Rell ordered the Corporation to rescind the
eviction notices,

on pain of losing any further state redevelopment aid. The
Governor then appointed a mediator to try to reach a compromise between the
City and the

former owners. Aided by a legal opinion from the state
attorney general that the City could use redevelopment funds to negotiate
settlements in amounts

larger than the values set in the condemnation proceedings,
the former owners gradually began to settle. In March 2006 , Wilhelmina Dery
died at the

age of 89 , in the same room in which she was born. Her
family settled shortly thereafter. Finally, only two former owners, Susette
Kelo and Michael

Cristofaro, remained intransigent. The City Council voted in
June 2006 to commence eviction proceedings against them. The Governor sought to
broker

a last minute compromise, which the City rebuffed. The City
combined its tough stance with sweetened settlement offers, which Kelo and
Cristofaro

accepted before any eviction could take place. The
settlement with Kelo included an agreement by the City to pay to move her house
to a new location,

and forgive all claims of unpaid rents and taxes. One source
reported the value of her settlement at $ 442 , 000 , compared to the appraised
value of her

home of $ 123 , 000 in 2000. See Our View: Eminent Domain
Ends Badly for Those Involved, Norwich Bulletin, August 29 , 2006 , at 7 A. The
house was

moved in 2008. Ms. Kelo eventually decided to use her
settlement money to purchase another home on the opposite side of the Thames
River. Given the

negative publicity about the decision, the economic
recession starting in 2008 , and a sharp downturn in the real estate market,
the developer slated to

receive the property for $ 1 per year, Corcoran Jennison
(see footnote 4 , supra), abandoned the project. Pfizer closed the research
facility it had built

adjacent to the site, as a cost-saving measure. Today, the
Fort Trumbull Redevelopment site consists of 90 acres of bare ground, with no
prospect of

generating additional jobs or tax revenues in the
foreseeable future. Is this sad ending attributable to a misguided use of
eminent domain for economic

development, a misguided assault on use of eminent domain
for economic development, or just bad timing?

4 .In its most complete discussion of the public use
requirement prior to _Kelo_ , the Supreme Court had said that the public use
requirement was

“coterminous with the scope of the sovereign’s police
powers,” and that courts should review exercises of eminent domain only to
assure that they are

“rationally related to a conceivable public purpose.” Hawaii
Housing Auth. v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 , 240 , 242 – 43 ( 1984 ).
(Interestingly, the Court’s

unanimous opinion in _Midkiff_ was written by Justice
O’Connor.) Courts understood this to mean that the Fifth Amendment’s public use
language

required only the most deferential type of “rationality
review,” under which legislation is upheld as long as the court can conceive of
a legitimate

purpose the legislature might have harbored and a rational
person might believe that the taking would achieve this purpose. Does _Kelo_
reaffirm this

highly deferential position, or does the Court suggest a
more demanding standard of review?

```



1190



```

5 .Note that the majority does not quote the line in
_Berman_ and _Midkiff_ about eminent domain being coterminous with the police
power, and

Justice O’Connor, in her dissent, says “[t]his language was
unnecessary to the specific holding” in _Midkiff_ and “the police power and
‘public use’ cannot

always be equated.” The point the Court seemed to be making
in _Berman_ and _Midkiff_ when it uttered these words was that the government
could use the

power of eminent domain to achieve any purpose within the
permissible ends of government. Since government at all levels does all kinds
of things to

try to promote economic development, from regulating the
money supply to providing tax incentives for new business investment to
mandating that all

children receive an education that allows them to be
productive members of the workforce, the “coterminous powers” idea would seem
to compel the

conclusion that eminent domain can be used for economic
development. Has the Court now embraced the notion that the power of eminent
domain is

narrower, in terms of the purposes for which it can be used,
than the police power or the power to tax and spend? What is the justification
for confining

the power of eminent domain—which always requires the
payment of just compensation—to a narrower sphere than the power to regulate or
tax

property—neither of which requires the payment of
compensation?

6 .None of the opinions in _Kelo_ discusses the holdout
problem, which most commentators today regard as an important justification for
the power

of eminent domain. See Ilya Somin, The Grasping Hand, supra
at 90 – 99 ; Richard A. Posner, The Supreme Court 2004 Term, Foreword: A
Political

Court, 119 Harv. L. Rev. 31 , 83 – 94 ( 2005 ); see also
James E. Krier, The Takings-Puzzle Puzzle, 38 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 1143 (
1997 ). Did the New

London redevelopment face a holdout problem? The NLDRC
acquired about 100 parcels in the 90 - acre site through voluntary negotiations
but had

reached an impasse with the nine owners of the last 15
parcels. Could it have built around these pockets of resistance? The answer is
not clear, because it

was not the focus of the judicial inquiry in the lower
courts. One explanation for the need to acquire all parcels is that this would
make the re-transfer to

a developer more appealing, since the developer could then
work on the equivalent of a greenfield site rather than have to make costly
adjustments to

accommodate existing structures. But this argument is just a
matter of costs. As the Institute for Justice has noted in some of its public
statements, the

plan also called for the preservation of one structure—the
Italian Dramatic Club—a private club patronized by many of the city’s leading
figures. So the

project could have proceeded without the nonconsenting
parcels, provided the City was prepared to offer additional subsidies to the
developer. Another

explanation is that much of the area is below the 100 - year
floodplain, and thus had to be re-graded in order to make it eligible for new
development.

Whether this could be accomplished without moving or at
least jacking up existing structures is doubtful. Some type of coercion of the
nonconsenting

owners, whether through the use of eminent domain or the
police power, may thus have been necessary to complete the project. Should
courts pay more

attention to the severity of the holdout problem in
determining whether exercises of eminent domain are for a “public use”?

7 .Does Justice O’Connor’s dissenting opinion offer a
normatively justifiable theory of what “public use” means? Her opinion
acknowledges that

public use has been defined to mean public purpose, and that
property can be condemned and retransferred to another private owner if there
is a valid

public purpose. But, she insists, when public use is defined
to mean public purpose, the purpose must be to rectify some “precondemnation
use of the

targeted property [that inflicts] affirmative harm on
society.” What is the constitutional theory that would justify restricting
eminent domain to the

rectification of undesirable conditions inherent in property
or in the pattern of ownership of property, as opposed to the provision of
public goods or

positive externalities not attainable under the current
pattern of ownership of property? What might Ronald Coase, see Chapter I, say
about this

distinction? Is this bad-prevention versus good-promotion
distinction just a way to draw a line in the sand in order to avoid the
slippery slopes Justice

O’Connor perceives ahead if condemnation is permitted for
economic development or other types of general public goods? If so, why draw
the line at

the bad/good distinction rather than someplace else, such as
the no-pretext formulation of the majority?

8 .Would restricting eminent domain for economic development
to cases involving blighted property protect minority and low-income

neighborhoods, as Justice O’Connor implies? Or would
minority and low-income neighborhoods be more likely to be targeted under a
regime that

requires a determination of “blight,” as Justice Thomas
argues? For evidence that traditional urban renewal programs, which typically
begin with a

determination that a neighborhood is blighted,
disproportionately affect poor and minority neighborhoods, see Wendell E.
Pritchett, The Public Menace

of Blight: Urban Renewal and the Private Uses of Eminent
Domain, 21 Yale L. & Pol’y Rev. 1 ( 2003 ).

9 .Many of the post- _Kelo_ statutes and newly-restrictive
state court decisions prohibit the use of eminent domain for “economic
development _.”_

What does this mean? Does it mean that economic development
cannot be _a_ purpose of condemnation? If so, then nearly all takings would be

unconstitutional, since nearly all takings for highways or
utility easements are motivated in part by a desire to encourage economic
development. Does it

mean that economic development cannot be the _sole_ purpose
of condemnation? But was economic development the sole purpose of the taking in
New

London? Would it be relatively easy to evade such a
restriction, by tacking a public walkway or small park onto condemnation
projects otherwise

designed to further some commercial development?

10 .Both Justice O’Connor and Justice Thomas argue that the
words “for public use” would be meaningless unless they are understood to
restrict

the scope of the power of eminent domain. But why would
these words be meaningless if they were understood to be a synonym for eminent
domain? In

other words, is it possible the Fifth Amendment can be read
to say: Nor shall private property be taken _by eminent domain_ without just
compensation?

This would not be a trivial provision: It would mandate just
compensation whenever the government takes property by eminent domain (or by
other

processes tantamount to eminent domain), as opposed to in
some

#1192

other way, such as by committing a tort or by taxation. See
Matthew P. Harrington, “Public Use” and the Original Understanding of the
So-Called

“Takings” Clause, 53 Hastings L.J. 1245 ( 2002 ); Daniel B.
Kelly, The “Public Use” Requirement in Eminent Domain Law: A Rationale Based on
Secret

Purchases and Private Influence, 92 Cornell L. Rev. 1 , 8 (
2006 ). As long as we are looking closely at the language of the Fifth
Amendment, why would

the Framers put the word “without” before “just
compensation,” rather than before “public use,” if public use were understood
to be a restriction on the

scope of the power of eminent domain? On the other hand, if
the public use language does not imply any restriction, would this mean that a
taking from

A to give to B would pass muster as long as compensation was
provided? Or are there some purpose-related limits implicit in “tak[ing] for
public

use”/eminent domain after all?

11 .The actual drafting history of the Takings Clause is
very thin. See David A. Dana & Thomas W. Merrill, Property: Takings ch. 2 (
2002 ).

Blackstone, on whom Justice Thomas relies, did not argue
that eminent domain could be exercised only for public uses. Blackstone thought
the power of

condemnation required the constructive consent of the
property owner, which could be obtained only through the approval of the
legislature. 1 William

Blackstone, Commentaries * 135 ( 1768 ). The public use or
public purpose requirement appears to have entered American law through the
influence of

natural rights jurists such as Grotius, Pufendorf, and
Vattel. Dana & Merrill, supra, at 19 – 22. These writers were the ones who
first used the word

“eminent domain,” and this term, along with the movement to
restrict eminent domain to actual public uses, entered American law in the 1830
s. The

debate over the original understanding of “for public use”
thus may boil down to whether one thinks the Framers were more influenced by
Blackstone

and Locke (who would require the consent of the legislature)
or by continental thinkers like Grotius (who would require a public use or
purpose).

### 2 .JUST COMPENSATION

The other significant constitutional limitation on eminent
domain is that the condemning authority must pay “just compensation.” The

following case discusses several difficult issues that arise
in attempting to fix a “just” price on property when the owner and the
condemning

authority have not been able to negotiate a value acceptable
to both sides.

```

■ MR.
JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court. This case presents
important questions respecting standards for valuing property taken

for public use. * * *

The United States condemned a strip across the respondents’
lands for tracks of the Central Pacific Railroad, relocation of which was

#1193

necessary on account of the prospective flooding of the old
right-of-way by waters to be impounded by [the creation of a federally-funded
dam]

in California. * * *

In his report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1937, the
Secretary of the Interior stated that Shasta, California, had been selected for
the

site of the Sacramento River dam. Its construction involved
relocation of some thirty miles of the line of the railroad.

Portions of respondents’ lands were required for the
relocated right-of-way. Alternate routes were surveyed by March 1936 and staked
at

intervals of 100 feet. Prior to the authorization of the
project, the area of which respondents’ tracts form a part was largely
uncleared brush land.

In the years 1936 and 1937 certain parcels were purchased
with the intention of subdividing them and, in 1937, subdivisions were plotted
and

there grew up a settlement known as Boomtown, in which the
respondents’ lands lie. Two of the respondents were realtors interested in

developing the neighborhood. By December 1938 the town had
been built up for business and residential purposes.

December 14, 1938, the United States filed in the District
Court for Northern California a complaint in eminent domain against the

respondents and others whose lands were needed for the
relocation of the railroad. On that day the Government also filed a declaration
of taking.

In this declaration the estimate of just compensation to be
paid for a tract belonging to three of the respondents as co-tenants was
estimated at

$2,550 and that sum was deposited in court. On the
application of these owners the court directed the Clerk to pay each of them
one-third of the

deposit, or $850, on account of the compensation they were
entitled to receive.

The action in eminent domain was tried to a jury. The
respondents offered opinion evidence as to the fair market value of the tracts
involved

and also as to severance damage to lots of which portions
were taken. Each witness was asked to state his opinion as to market value of
the land

taken as at December 14, 1938, the date of the filing of the
complaint. Government counsel objected to the form of the question on the
ground

that, as the United States was definitely committed to the
project August 26, 1937, the respondents were not entitled to have included in
an

estimate of value, as of the date the lands were taken, any
increment of value due to the Government’s authorization of, and commitment to,
the

project. The trial court sustained the objection and
required the question to be reframed so as to call for market value at the date
of the taking,

excluding therefrom any increment of value accruing after
August 26, 1937, due to the authorization of the project. Under stress of the
ruling,

and over objection and exception, questions calling for
opinion evidence were phrased to comply with the court’s decision. The jury
rendered

verdicts in favor of various respondents.

The three respondents who had received $850 each on account
of compensation were awarded less than the total paid them. The court

#1194

entered judgment that title to the lands was in the United
States and judgment in favor of respondents respectively for the amounts
awarded them.

Judgment was entered against the three respondents and in
favor of the United States for the amounts they had received in excess of the
verdicts

with interest. They moved to set aside the money judgments
against them on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to enter them.
The

motions were overruled. All of the respondents appealed * *
*

The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment holding,
by a divided court, that the trial judge erred in his rulings and in his
charge,

and unanimously that the District Court was without
jurisdiction to award the United States a judgment for amounts overpaid. A
majority of the

court were of opinion the witnesses should have been asked
to state the fair market value of the lands as of the date of taking without

qualification, and the judge should have charged that this
value measured the compensation to which the respondents were entitled.

1.The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution provides that
private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.

Such compensation means the full and perfect equivalent in
money of the property taken. The owner is to be put in as good position
pecuniarily

as he would have occupied if his property had not been
taken.

It is conceivable that an owner’s indemnity should be
measured in various ways depending upon the circumstances of each case and that
no

general formula should be used for the purpose. In an
effort, however, to find some practical standard, the courts early adopted, and
have

retained, the concept of market value. The owner has been
said to be entitled to the “value”, the “market value”, and the “fair market
value” of

what is taken. The term “fair” hardly adds anything to the
phrase “market value”, which denotes what “it fairly may be believed that a
purchaser

in fair market conditions would have given”, or, more
concisely, “market value fairly determined.”

Respondents correctly say that value is to be ascertained as
of the date of taking. But they insist that no element which goes to make up

value as at that moment is to be discarded or eliminated. We
think the proposition is too broadly stated. Where, for any reason, property
has no

market resort must be had to other data to ascertain its
value; and, even in the ordinary case, assessment of market value involves the
use of

assumptions, which make it unlikely that the appraisal will
reflect true value with nicety. It is usually said that market value is what a
willing

buyer would pay in cash to a willing seller. Where the
property taken, and that in its vicinity, has not in fact been sold within
recent times, or in

significant amounts, the application of this concept
involves, at best, a guess by informed persons.

Again, strict adherence to the criterion of market value may
involve inclusion of elements which, though they affect such value, must in

fairness be eliminated in a condemnation case, as where the
formula is attempted to be applied as between an owner who may not want to part

#1195

with his land because of its special adaptability to his own
use, and a taker who needs the land because of its peculiar fitness for the
taker’s

purposes. These elements must be disregarded by the fact
finding body in arriving at “fair” market value.

Since the owner is to receive no more than indemnity for his
loss, his award cannot be enhanced by any gain to the taker. Thus although the

market value of the property is to be fixed with due
consideration of all its available uses, its special value to the condemnor as
distinguished

from others who may or may not possess the power to condemn,
must be excluded as an element of market value. The district judge so charged

the jury and no question is made as to the correctness of
the instruction.

There is, however, another possible element of market value,
which is the bone of contention here. Should the owner have the benefit of any

increment of value added to the property taken by the action
of the public authority in previously condemning adjacent lands? If so, were
the

lands in question so situate as to entitle respondents to
the benefit of this increment?

Courts have to adopt working rules in order to do
substantial justice in eminent domain proceedings. One of these is that a
parcel of land

which has been used and treated as an entity shall be so
considered in assessing compensation for the taking of part or all of it.

This has begotten subsidiary rules. If only a portion of a
single tract is taken the owner’s compensation for that taking includes any
element

of value arising out of the relation of the part taken to
the entire tract. Such damage is often, though somewhat loosely, spoken of as
severance

damage. On the other hand, if the taking has in fact
benefited the remainder the benefit may be set off against the value of the
land taken.

As respects other property of the owner consisting of
separate tracts adjoining that affected by the taking, the Constitution has
never been

construed as requiring payment of consequential damages; and
unless the legislature so provides, as it may, benefits are not assessed
against such

neighboring tracts for increase in their value.

If a distinct tract is condemned, in whole or in part, other
lands in the neighborhood may increase in market value due to the proximity of

the public improvement erected on the land taken. Should the
Government, at a later date, determine to take these other lands, it must pay
their

market value as enhanced by this factor of proximity. If,
however, the public project from the beginning included the taking of certain
tracts but

only one of them is taken in the first instance, the owner
of the other tracts should not be allowed an increased value for his lands
which are

ultimately to be taken any more than the owner of the tract
first condemned is entitled to be allowed an increased market value because
adjacent

lands not immediately taken increased in value due to the
projected improvement.

#1196

The question then is whether the respondents’ lands were
probably within the scope of the project from the time the Government was

committed to it. If they were not, but were merely adjacent
lands, the subsequent enlargement of the project to include them ought not to
deprive

the respondents of the value added in the meantime by the
proximity of the improvement. If, on the other hand, they were, the Government
ought

not to pay any increase in value arising from the known fact
that the lands probably would be condemned. The owners ought not to gain by

speculating on probable increase in value due to the
Government’s activities.

In which category do the lands in question fall? The
project, from the date of its final and definite authorization in August 1937,
included

the relocation of the railroad right-of-way, and one
probable route was marked out over the respondents’ lands. This being so, it
was proper to tell

the jury that the respondents were entitled to no increase
in value arising after August 1937 because of the likelihood of the taking of
their

property. If their lands were probably to be taken for
public use, in order to complete the project in its entirety, any increase in
value due to that

fact could only arise from speculation by them, or by
possible purchasers from them, as to what the Government would be compelled to
pay as

compensation. * * *

2.We think the court below erred in holding the District
Court without power to enter a judgment against three of the respondents to
whom

payments in excess of the jury’s verdicts had been made out
of the funds deposited with the Court.

Examination of the Act of February 26, 1931, discloses that
the declaration of taking is to be filed in the proceeding for condemnation at
its

inception or at any later time. When the declaration is
filed the amount of estimated compensation is to be deposited with the court to
be paid as

the court may order “for or on account” of the just
compensation to be awarded the owners. Thus the acquisition by the Government
of title and

immediate right to possession, and the deposit of the
estimated compensation, occur as steps in the main proceeding.

The purpose of the statute is twofold. First, to give the
Government immediate possession of the property and to relieve it of the burden
of

interest accruing on the sum deposited from the date of
taking to the date of judgment in the eminent domain proceeding. Secondly, to
give the

former owner, if his title is clear, immediate cash
compensation to the extent of the Government’s estimate of the value of the
property. The Act

recognizes that there may be an error in the estimate and
appropriately provides that, if the judgment ultimately awarded shall be in
excess of the

amount deposited, the owner shall recover the excess with
interest. But there is no correlative provision for repayment of any excess by
the

owner to the United States. The necessary result is, so the
respondents say, that any sum paid them in excess of the jury’s award is their
property,

which the United States may not recover.

#1197

All the provisions of the Act taken together require a
contrary conclusion. The payment is of estimated compensation; it is intended
as a

provisional and not a final settlement with the owner; it is
a payment “on account of” compensation and not a final settlement of the amount
due.

To hold otherwise would defeat the policy of the statute and
work injustice; would be to encourage federal officials to underestimate the
value of

the property with the result that the Government would be
saddled with interest on a larger sum from date of taking to final award, and
would be

to deny the owner the immediate use of cash approximating
the value of his land.

Respondents assert that whatever the substantive right of
the United States to repayment of the surplus, the District Court in rendering

judgment against them deprived them of property without due
process of law. We think the contention is unsound.

The District Court was dealing with money deposited in its
chancery to be disbursed under its direction in connection with an action

pending before it. The situation is like that in which
litigants deposit money as security or to await the outcome of litigation.
Notwithstanding the

fact that the court released the fund to the respondents,
the parties were still before it and it did not lose control of the fund but
retained

jurisdiction to deal with its retention or repayment as
justice might require.

Denial of notice and hearing is asserted. But, while it is
true that the court included the judgment of restitution in its general
judgment in the

condemnation proceedings without notice to the parties or
hearing, the respondents made motions to set aside the judgment against them,
and the

court heard and acted on the motions. The respondents had
full opportunity to urge any meritorious reasons why judgment of restitution
should

not be entered against them. We think they were entitled to
no more. * * *

The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and
that of the District Court affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The idea of “fair market value” as the measure of just
compensation is inherently paradoxical. Eminent domain is typically used when

negotiations for a market transaction break down, so by
definition there is no “market value” in the sense of an arm’s length
negotiated price for the

property in question. Instead, fair market value refers to a
hypothetical price—a guess about what the property would have fetched if it had
followed the

path of voluntary as opposed to compelled exchange. Real
estate appraisers have developed a variety of approaches for estimating fair
market value. The

most common are ( 1 ) examining recent transactions in which
the property in question was sold, and adjusting for general changes in market
prices in the

area since the date of those transactions; ( 2 ) examining
recent transactions of other parcels of property in the area similar to the
property in question, and

adjusting for differences in size, location, and quality of

```



1198



```

improvements; ( 3 ) estimating the rental value of the
property in question, and capitalizing this to reach a purchase price using a
rate of return commonly

used as a benchmark for real estate investments in the area;
( 4 ) determining the replacement cost of the land and improvements taken, and
adjusting

downward to reflect depreciation due to age and wear and
tear. See 4 Julius L. Sackman, Nichols on Eminent Domain § 12. 02 ( 3 d ed.
2005 ); 1 Lewis

Orgel, Valuation Under the Law of Eminent Domain §§ 136 – 38
, 176 – 87 (James C. Bonbright ed., 2 d ed. 1953 ); 2 id. §§ 188 – 89.

2 .In economic terms, the _Miller_ Court can be read as
saying that the owner should be awarded the _opportunity cost_ of having his
land taken away.

The opportunity cost is the highest and best use of the land
_other than_ the use proposed by the condemning authority. See, e.g., Armen A.
Alchian, Cost,

in 3 International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences 404 ,
404 (David L. Sills ed., 1968 ) (“[T]he cost of an event is the highest-valued
opportunity

necessarily forsaken.”). Thus, suppose the property is
currently being used as a farm, the highest and best use would be a suburban
subdivision, and the

government proposes to take the land for a highway. On
condemnation, the government must pay the value the land would obtain if sold
for

development as a subdivision, the highest and best economic
use (other than as a highway). What might be the justification for basing
compensation

awards on opportunity cost rather than existing use? See
generally Katrina M. Wyman, The Measure of Just Compensation, 41 U.C. Davis L.
Rev. 239

( 2007 ).

3 .The _Miller_ Court also concludes that just compensation
means that the owner is not entitled to an award based on the
after-condemnation value

of property in the area. Thus, for example, if the current
use is “uncleared brush land,” and the government proposes to use the property
to relocate a

railroad displaced by a government-built reservoir, the
value should be based on the highest and best use of uncleared brush land, not
the value of land

next to a government reservoir. The intuition behind this,
presumably, is that awarding the condemnee the value of land next to a
reservoir would confer

a windfall on the condemnee. The condemnee has done nothing
to create this enhanced value—it is a product of the resources that will be
expended by

the government in building the dam, which will be paid for
by the taxpayers. Valuing condemned property on a post-condemnation basis would
also be

partially self-defeating, insofar as the public benefits of
the taking would be capitalized in the land values and transferred to the
condemnee.

4 .The issue in _Miller_ is trickier. Suppose the government
builds the reservoir, paying for the land according to its pre-reservoir value.
Then, one

year later, the government decides to build a highway around
the edge of the reservoir. What is the proper valuation of the land taken for
the highway—

uncleared brush land in the middle of nowhere or land in the
vicinity of a reservoir? Here it seems clear that, under the opportunity-cost
approach, the

proper value is the value of land in the vicinity of a
reservoir. See Christopher Serkin, The Meaning of Value: Assessing Just
Compensation for

Regulatory Takings, 99 Nw. U. L. Rev. 677 , 688 – 89 ( 2005
). But doesn’t this also confer a windfall on the condemnee? Perhaps it does,
if we focus on

the original cost

```



1199



```

of the land to the condemnee, and the fact that the
newly-enhanced value of the land is largely attributable to the resources the
government expended in

creating the reservoir. Yet there is a strong efficiency
argument for awarding the condemnee the current value of the land: We want the
government to

select a route for the highway that takes into account all
the costs of building the highway, including the costs of land. Perhaps there
is a better route for

the highway farther away from the reservoir, one that goes
through cheaper land that has fewer alternative uses. Pricing the land at its
current

opportunity cost sends the right signals on highway location
to the government. Note too that if the condemnee had sold the land between the
time the

reservoir was built and the highway project was announced,
the condemnee would have obtained a price that reflects the value of land in
the vicinity of

a reservoir, not the price of uncleared brush land in the
middle of nowhere. So in this sense there is no windfall. Do you see now why
the critical issue in

_Miller_ is whether the substitute right-of-way for the
railroad was part of the scope of original project, as opposed to being a
separate project that arose

after the reservoir was built?

5 .Ordinarily, as the Court notes, the temporal reference
point for determining fair market value is the date at which title transfers.
Does the Court

inject an element of indeterminacy into the rules for
determining just compensation by departing from this reference point in
determining whether the

respondents’ property was part of a single government
project? For these purposes, the Court says that the temporal reference point
is “the time the

Government was committed to” the project. Isn’t it likely
that the government’s “commitment” to a project like a major reservoir
solidifies gradually

over time, making the Court’s test inherently problematic?
Why was the Court willing to subject eminent domain to the added administrative
costs of its

“committed to the project” test? Was it simply a dislike of
rewarding land speculators? Or is there a more substantive reason for moving
the temporal

reference point for the scope of the project to an earlier
point in time than the transfer of title? See Serkin, The Meaning of Value,
supra, at 696 – 99.

6 .Another objection to the fair-market-value formula is
that it provides no recovery for the subjective value that owners attach to
their property.

Most people attach some premium above market value to
property they own. Otherwise, they would sell for market value. The premium may
be based

on the fact that they are psychologically attached to the
property, or they like the neighborhood, or they have made special
modifications to the property

to suit their particular needs, or simply because they want
to avoid the inconvenience of moving. Under the fair-market-value standard, no
compensation

is expressly given for this subjective premium above market
value. Many commentators therefore have assumed that the fair market value
measure

results in systematic undercompensation of property owners,
especially where the property is occupied by a residence or a functioning
business. Does

the problem of uncompensated subjective value suggest that
condemnation of certain kinds of property likely to have high subjective value
should be off

limits or subject to a higher standard of review under the
public use requirement? See Margaret Jane Radin, Property and

```



1200



```

Personhood, 34 Stan L. Rev. 957 , 1007 – 12 ( 1982 )
(excerpted in Chapter III). Would private residential homes be included in this
category? What about

a small business or farm that has been in the same family
for many years?

7 .A less drastic proposal for dealing with the problem of
subjective value would be to pay a bonus above fair market value at least in
certain

categories of takings. See, e.g., Robert C. Ellickson,
Alternatives to Zoning: Covenants, Nuisance Rules, and Fines as Land Use
Controls, 40 U. Chi. L.

Rev. 681 , 736 – 37 ( 1973 ). Some of the Mill Acts
mentioned in _Kelo_ (footnote 8 , omitted in the excerpt) provided for such
bonus compensation. See

Head v. Amoskeag Mfg. Co., 113 U.S. 9 ( 1885 ) (quoting New
Hampshire Mill Act, providing that compensation be set at 150 % of appraised
value).

And in the aftermath of _Kelo_ , some states have passed
statutes mandating higher compensation of 125 % or 150 % of fair market value
depending on

various defined circumstances, mainly residential use. See
Wyman, 41 U.C. Davis L. Rev. at 257 & n. 61. But would such a system of
bonus

compensation create a risk of overcompensating property
owners who, for whatever reason, do not attach much subjective value to their
holdings? The

federal government and many states have partially responded
to the undercompensation problem by enacting relocation acts, which give
persons whose

property is condemned additional monies for some
transitional expenses like moving costs. See Uniform Relocation Assistance Act
of 1970 , 42 U.S.C.

4601 et seq. A recent study suggests that property owners,
aided by generous interpretations of federal and state relocation acts, often
receive substantial

premiums above fair market value, especially where takings
are politically controversial. See Nicole Stelle Garnett, The Neglected
Political Economy of

Eminent Domain, 105 Mich. L. Rev. 101 ( 2006 ). Does this
suggest that caution is in order before mandating additional awards of bonus
compensation?

8 .The reasons for sticking to fair market value and denying
any compensation for assembly gain or subjective values are several. The reason

mentioned most often in the cases is the difficulty of
valuing things like psychological attachment or consequential damages like lost
business good will.

Including such increments of value would therefore increase
the administrative costs of eminent domain proceedings. See, e.g., United
States v. 564. 54

Acres of Land, 441 U.S. 506 , 516 – 17 ( 1979 ) (declining
to award replacement cost in condemnation of a summer camp). Another reason
harkens back to

the public use issue again. We presume eminent domain will
be used only for public projects like highways and schools that provide public
goods that

benefit everyone in the community. These sorts of projects
arguably deserve public subsidies, and one form the subsidies can take is by
providing less

than full indemnification to those whose property is
condemned to make way for the project. So there is a linkage between the public
use limitation and

incomplete compensation for takings. See Thomas W. Merrill,
Incomplete Compensation for Takings, 11 N.Y.U. Envtl. L.J. 110 ( 2002 ). The
stronger the

public use limit, the stronger the case for incomplete
compensation. Does it follow that a weak public use justification, like the one
upheld in _Kelo_ ,

should be coupled with a more complete measure of just
compensation? For an argument to this effect, see James E. Krier &
Christopher Serkin, Public

Ruses, 2004 Mich. St. L. Rev. 859.

9 .In an important article, Brian Angelo Lee, Just
Undercompensation: The Idiosyncratic Premium in Eminent Domain, 113 Colum. L.
Rev. 593

( 2013 ), argues that the concern about uncompensated
subjective value is overstated. Lee points out that many of the values not
expressly compensated in

eminent domain, such as moving costs, attorneys’ fees,
neighborhood amenities, and even the psychological attachment to property
associated with

longstanding occupancy, are taken into account by owners in
deciding whether to sell voluntarily. Owners will sell voluntarily only when
all the costs of

relocating are exceeded by the benefits of the price they
obtain when they sell. Thus, insofar as fair market value is based on data
about previous sales of

the property, sales of comparable properties, or even the
capitalization of market rents, the standard measure of compensation will
capture these sorts of

costs. Lee argues that commentary about just compensation
should shift from “subjective value” to the question whether it is fair to
compensate for

“idiosyncratic value,” that is, for costs (including
psychological costs) associated with relocation that are idiosyncratically high
relative to those of the

average owner of comparable property. Lee is surely correct
that fair market value captures indirectly many of the costs of relocation that
are not

expressly compensated. But is there reason to think that the
set of owners who decide to sell voluntarily may, on average, value the costs
of relocation at

a lower level than owners who do not want to relocate? If
so, does it remain the case that fair market value undercompensates those who
do not want to

move, even if to a more qualified degree than is often
assumed?

The Flight 93 Case

A version of Miller’s holding that condemned property should
be valued when the government becomes committed to the project, as

opposed to when title formally changes hands, was recently
presented in a case in which the federal government condemned land in rural

Pennsylvania as a memorial for the victims who died on
Flight 93 on September 1 1, 2001. Flight 93 was the fourth airplane
commandeered by

hijackers on 9/11, who were evidently targeting either the
White House or the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., for a suicide attack
similar

to the ones that brought down the World Trade Center towers
and struck the Pentagon. The terror attack was foiled when passengers on the
plane

attempted to take over the cockpit, which resulted in the
plane crashing in an empty field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. All persons on
the

plane were killed, but the bravery of the passengers likely
averted more widespread death and destruction. The passengers were regarded as

national heroes.

The land on which the plane crashed was owned by a family
corporation called Svonavec, Inc. It had once been strip-mined, but had no

active use at the time of the crash other than as the site
of some oil and gas leases. Once the debris from the crash was cleared and the
FBI

completed its investigation, people began driving to the
site to pay their respects to the victims. Svonavec constructed a temporary
viewing area

#1202

on the property. Eventually between 1 17,000 and 167,000
people traveled to the site each year. In 2002, Congress enacted legislation
establishing

the site as a national memorial, to be administered by the
National Park Service. Svonavec, Inc. nevertheless continued to operate a
private

memorial on the site for several more years. Eventually, the
government instituted an eminent domain proceeding, which resulted in a formal

transfer of title to the government on September 2, 2009.

There was no issue in the case about whether the taking was
a legitimate public use. The fact that the memorial would be constructed and

operated by the National Park Service and would be open to
the public meant the taking satisfied the public use requirement under even the
most

restrictive understanding of that term (government ownership
or actual use by the public). Interestingly, the Supreme Court’s first case
dealing

with public use involved a condemnation of the site of the
Gettysburg Civil War battlefield as a memorial to the fallen. United States v.

Gettysburg Elec. R. Co., 160 U.S. 668, 682 (1896) (holding
that the taking “touches the heart, and comes home to the imagination of every

citizen, and greatly tends to enhance his love and respect
for those institutions for which these heroic sacrifices were made.”).

The most difficult legal issue in the Flight 93 case
involved the proper date for undertaking the valuation, a question the trial
court called

“the scope of the project rule.” The district judge ruled
that the proper date was 2002, when Congress authorized a national memorial.

Consequently, any evidence about possible value that emerged
between 2002 and 2009, when title formally transferred to the government, could

not be considered. 275.81 Acres of Land, More or Less,
Situated in Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania, 2014 WL 1248205

(W.D. Pa. 2014).

Even so, the parties submitted wildly different proposed
valuations. Svonavec hired Randall Bell as an expert witness, who had made a

reputation proposing valuations for memorials at other
disaster sites, including the destruction of the World Trade Center towers and
the bombing

of the federal building in Oklahoma City. He testified that
the highest and best use of the property would be for a private memorial and
museum.

Adopting a method based on capitalization of expected
profits, including a generous estimate of annual visitation, significant
revenues for

admission charges and sales of souvenirs, and a low discount
rate (reflecting low risk of failure for such a project), he proposed that the
fair

market value of the land was $23.3 million. The government’s
expert witness countered that the economic success of any private memorial was

too speculative to be taken into account. He testified that
the highest and best use was as bare land, and looking to sales of comparative
land in

the area proposed a value of $610,000.

The district court judge appointed a three-person
commission, consisting of real estate appraisers, to recommend a fair market
value. The

commission largely adopted the views and methods of Mr.
Bell. It

#1203

concluded that the highest and best use of the land in 2002
would be as a private memorial park. Neither a comparable sales approach nor an

approach based on the reproduction cost was feasible, since
the property, as the site of an infamous airplane crash, was utterly unique.
The

commission nevertheless adjusted downward Mr. Bell’s
estimate of the probable number of annual visitors, reduced his proposed
admissions

charge, decided that a private memorial would not include a
museum that sold souvenirs, and raised the discount rate to reflect higher
risk. After

making these and other adjustments, the commission proposed
a value of $1,535,000, which the district court accepted.

The Constitution requires the payment of “just
compensation.” If the rationale of Miller is that compensation should be
determined in such a

manner as to avoid an unjustified windfall to the owner, why
is it “just” to compensate Svonavec, Inc. for the added value created by the
fortuity

that a plane crashed on its land? Surely, Svonavec did
nothing to generate this extra value. If the value of Svonavec’s land the day
before the

plane crashed was $610,000, based on sales of comparable
land, why is the corporation entitled to an extra $925,000 after the crash?
Should the

principle of the Miller decision be extended to exclude from
the determination of market value not only any increment in value created by
the

government’s proposed taking, but also any other fortuitous
event for which the owner can claim no responsibility? Or is Svonavec’s
entitlement

to the windfall simply a function of the general principle
of accession, which automatically awards unanticipated increments in value to
the

owner of the relevant asset, in this case land? Recall in
this connection Goddard v. Winchell (Chapter II), awarding a meteorite to the
owner of

the land on which it falls.

Partial Takings

Miller discusses another problem: how to determine just
compensation when the government takes a portion of a parcel rather than the

whole thing. Here, the established rule is that the
landowner is entitled to the fair market value of what is taken plus so-called
“severance

damages” for any loss in value to the part that is not
taken. 4A Julius L. Sackman, Nichols on Eminent Domain § 14A.03 (3d ed. 2005).
For

example, if the government condemns a 200-foot strip of land
across an owner’s property for a highway, the owner is entitled to the fair
market

value of the 200-foot strip of land. In addition, if the
highway diminishes the value of the remaining land—perhaps by making access to
the

remaining land more difficult—the owner will be entitled to
severance damages reflecting the reduced market value of the land not taken.

As the Court observes, many jurisdictions, including the
federal government, will also make adjustments for any offsetting benefits that
the

taking creates for the portion of the property that is not
taken. To continue with the example, if the partial taking for a highway
results in

#1204

an increase in the value of the land not taken—perhaps
because the highest and best use of the remaining land is now for commercial
uses like

gas stations and motels given the proximity of the
highway—then the government is entitled to subtract the increase in value of
the remaining

land from the compensation it must pay for the strip of land
taken.

The practice of subtracting offsetting benefits became
controversial during the railroad construction boom in the nineteenth century.
The

problem was one of horizontal equity. The introduction of
the railroad would raise the value of all land in the vicinity of the railroad.
But if only

the landowners whose land was taken for the railroad
right-of-way were charged for offsetting benefits, they could end up getting
nothing for the

strip of land taken, while everyone whose land was not taken
would get the benefit of the higher land values without giving up anything in

return. Many states responded to this situation by
developing a distinction between “general” offsetting benefits and “special”
offsetting benefits.

General benefits, like the increased value of all land in
the community due to the arrival of the railroad, were not subject to offset.
Only special

benefits—those that inured to the particular owner who
suffered a partial taking—were eligible for offset. The distinction between
general and

special benefits, however, proved to be difficult to apply
in many circumstances. More recently, a trend of sorts has emerged in which
state courts

have rejected the general/special distinction as unworkable,
and instead have adopted a simple rule in partial takings cases that compares
the fair

market value of the property before the taking to the fair
market value of the property after the taking, awarding the difference (if any)
to the

condemnee. See Borough of Harvey Cedars v. Karan, 70 A.3d
524 (N.J. 2013) (reviewing history, adopting the before-and-after test, and

reducing compensation for a partial taking of beachfront
property to install a dune providing enhanced protection against storm surges).
The

before-and-after approach is easy to apply, and
automatically incorporates all benefits and detriments to the owner in
determining compensation

for a partial taking. But does it solve the horizontal
equity problem that led to the general/special distinction?

The rules for partial takings apply only to those who
experience a partial taking of their property. Those whose property is not
subject to a

partial taking but whose property values are affected by the
exercise of eminent domain, such as neighbors, are not eligible for severance

damages, nor are they charged for offsetting benefits. As
Miller observes, the rules also apply only when a partial taking affects a
single parcel. If

a landowner owns two different parcels, any damage that a
taking on one parcel does to the second parcel is not compensated (nor are
offsetting

benefits to the second parcel recouped). What is the
rationale for limiting severance damages and offsetting benefits to the “single
parcel” subject

to a partial taking, rather than applying these rules more
generally to all parcels affected by the exercise of eminent domain?

#1205

The Treatment of Assembly Gain

The Court in Miller observes: “Since the owner is to receive
no more than indemnity for his loss, his award cannot be enhanced by any gain

to the taker. Thus although the market value of the property
is to be fixed with due consideration of all its available uses, its special
value to the

condemnor as distinguished from others who may or may not
possess the power to condemn, must be excluded as an element of market value.”

This is a longstanding principle of just compensation law.
See, e.g., City of New York v. Sage, 239 U.S. 57 (1915). But in certain
circumstances

it raises questions about whether it is consistent with what
is “just.” Indeed, this principle may be responsible in significant part for
what the

Institute of Justice (which represented the plaintiffs in
the Kelo case) has called “eminent domain abuse,” i.e., the use of eminent
domain to

acquire large development sites in urban areas which are
then transferred at bargain prices to private entities for a development
project.

The basic problem can be illustrated by a simple example.
Suppose the condemnor (the government or an entity like a redevelopment

corporation) proposes to condemn ten contiguous parcels of
land in order to create one large parcel of land. Each of the ten parcels is
exactly

one-acre in size, and each has a fair market value before
the condemnation of $100,000. The aggregate compensation payable to the ten
owners

of the ten parcels is therefore $1,000,000. After the
condemnation, however, the ten-acre site has a fair market value (without
regard to its

proposed use) of $2,000,000. Why is that possible? It is
because ten-acre sites, especially in highly developed urban areas, are scarce
relative to

smaller parcels. And because they are scarce, they command a
higher market value on a per-acre basis under standard valuation techniques
used

by real estate appraisers (comparable sales, prior sales, or
capitalization of future rents or profits). In effect, the assembly of ten
separate parcels

into one large parcel has produces an “assembly gain” that
doubles the value of each parcel on a per-parcel basis. Yet under the principle
stated in

Miller , this assembly gain is captured by the condemnor not
by the condemnees.

The allocation of 100 percent of the assembly gain to the
condemnor may be justifiable when the taking is for a conventional public use,

such as a new public school or a municipal office building.
But it is more troublesome if the properties are taken with the intent to
transfer the

assembled parcel to a for-profit corporation for
construction of a shopping center or a “big box” retail store. It appears that
what happens in many

of these condemn-and-retransfer schemes is that the
condemning authority (e.g., a redevelopment corporation) transfers the
assembled parcel to

the transferee at the price paid to the individual
condemnees ($100,000 per parcel as in the example above). As a consequence, the
transferee gets

the assembled parcel at a substantial discount relative to
what it would have to pay if it acquired such a large parcel without using
eminent

domain ($1,000,000 rather than $2,000,000, in the example).
In other words, the Miller principle that the condemnor captures any gain

#1206

from the taking constitutes a subsidy to the use of eminent
domain, which without other limiting principles can lead to over-use of eminent

domain.

There are many potential solutions to the potential over-use
of eminent domain reflected in condemn-and-retransfer situations. One, of

course, would be to restrict or eliminate the use of the
eminent domain for such projects (see the Notes and Questions following the
Kelo case).

Another would be to require the transferees in such schemes
to pay the fair market value of the fully assembled parcel, rather than a price
based

on the aggregate of the compensation paid to the individual
owners of the pre-assembled parcels. This would at least eliminate the subsidy
to the

transferees, which should reduce their incentive to lobby
for the use of eminent domain to facilitate such projects. But if the local
government or

the redevelopment corporation can pocket the assembly gain,
this would not eliminate the incentive of local officials to promote such
schemes. A

third potential solution would be to require that the
assembly gain be shared with the owners of the individual parcels taken for
assembly. But

this would present complex problems about the appropriate
sharing principle (100%, 50% or what?) and about whether sharing would be

required for all exercises of eminent domain, including
highways and power lines, or would be limited to some subset of condemnations,
such as

those for “economic development” (however defined). These
complexities would almost certainly require legislation in order to implement
any

such reform.

A variation on the assembly gain issue is presented when the
government condemns a single parcel that is legally subdivided into two or

more lesser interests in property. The most common situation
is when property is legally subdivided between a lessor and lessee. But it can
also

occur when property is subject to a present possessory
interest (like a life estate) and a future interest (like a remainder) or is a
fee simple subject

to an easement. Here the courts have adopted a rule that is
subtly different from the Miller rule about the assembly gain created by
combining

multiple physically separate parcels. The dominant rule
(followed by the federal government and most states) is that the condemnor pays
the fair

market value of an undivided fee simple or what is called
the “unit fee” for short. See generally Victor P. Goldberg et al., Bargaining
in the

Shadow of Eminent Domain: Valuing and Apportioning
Condemnation Awards Between Landlord and Tenant, 34 U.C.L.A. L. Rev. 1083
(1987).

Thus, if the property is leased (or divided between present
and future interests or between a fee simple and an easement), the condemnor
pays the

fair market value of what the property would be worth
without the legal division into separate interests. Once this award is
deposited with the

court, the court then apportions the compensation between
the respective interest holders. For example, if the property is divided
between a

tenant who holds a 99-year ground lease developed by a
commercial office building and a landlord

#1207

who has a reversion in the land that will come into
possession in 99 years, the tenant will get virtually the entire award, and the
landlord will get

close to nothing. Conversely, if the property is divided
between a tenant who rents a house under a year-to-year periodic lease with an
adjustment

clause that adjusts the rent to market rates annually, and a
landlord who has a reversion, the landlord will get virtually the entire award
and the

tenant will get close to nothing (can you see why?).

Interestingly, the unit fee rule (unlike the physical
assembly rule) generally operates to award any “assembly gain” created by
wiping out

the separate legal interests created by divided ownership to
the condemnees, rather than the condemnor. To illustrate, suppose the land is
divided

between a fee simple and a conservation easement held by a
non-profit land preservation foundation (see Chapter IX). The conservation

easement requires that the land be maintained in perpetuity
for agricultural use. As restricted to such use, the market value of the land
is $50,000.

But if the land is taken for a highway project, under the
unit fee rule the government will pay the value of an unrestricted fee simple,
which may

be much higher, if the highest and best use of the parcel
(in economic terms) is, say, for a residential subdivision. Suppose the higher
value is

$100,000. By wiping out the conservation easement, the
condemnation generates an additional $50,000 in value, which is deposited with
the

court and must be apportioned between the owner of the fee
and the land preservation foundation. (Presumably the additional $50,000 would
be

paid to the foundation, which has lost the entire benefit of
the restriction.)

On occasion, the unit fee rule can generate what appear to
be unjust results. Consider, for example, City of Milwaukee Post No. 2874

Veterans of Foreign Wars v. Redevelopment Authority of the
City of Milwaukee, 768 N.W.2d 749 (Wis. 2009). The VFW owned some land in

downtown Milwaukee which it used as its headquarters and a
social club. It agreed to convey the property to a company for construction of
a

high-rise hotel. In return, the company agreed to lease a
large space on the ground floor of the hotel for the VFW to use as its
headquarters and a

social club, for a term of 99-years (renewable) at a rent of
$1 per year. The company also agreed to provide all utilities, perform periodic

maintenance, and pay all taxes for the VFW space. Over time,
the hotel fell into disrepair. It was transferred to two different universities
for use

as a student dormitory. But the deterioration of the living
areas above the ground floor became so serious, and the repair cost became so
great,

that the use of the building as a dormitory was eventually
abandoned. The Milwaukee Redevelopment Authority brought an action to condemn

the property, tear the hotel down, and resell the land for
some more promising use. Based on expert testimony, the court agreed that the
unit value

of the land and building was zero (actually it was negative,
since the costs of rehabilitation or demolition of the building exceeded its
potential

rental value). The VFW presented testimony that the value of
a rent-free, cost-

#1208

free ground floor space for 99-years (renewable) was
$1,800,000. The Wisconsin Supreme Court, over a dissent, nevertheless declined
to depart

from the unit fee rule, which it characterized as settled. A
unit fee value of zero divided by anything is zero, so the decision left the
VFW without

any facility for its activities and without any
compensation. The dissent argued that this result was fundamentally unjust, and
that the VFW’s

interest should have been valued separately from the rest of
the property.

If a rule (like the unit fee rule) generally produces
desirable results—in terms of simplifying valuation proceedings, creating
incentives for

parties to anticipate the proper allocation of condemnation
awards by contract, and awarding any assembly gain to condemnees—when if ever

should courts recognize an exception to the rule? In part,
this is yet another version of the perennial debate between rules and
standards. Should

separate valuation be permitted in any case in which one of
the condemnees would obtain more under separate valuation than under

apportionment of the award for an undivided fee? Or would
this introduce an element of gamesmanship into eminent domain proceedings that

would not be worth the additional complexity and cost it
would generate? Should the Milwaukee Redevelopment Corporation have compensated

the VFW for the fair market value of its sweetheart lease,
followed by a suit against the current owner of the hotel for restitution? The
argument

would be that the current owner was unjustly enriched by
having the redevelopment authority take a negative value asset off its hands.
What if

the current owner is insolvent or cannot generate the funds
to reimburse the government for compensating the VFW for the loss of its

headquarters and social club?

Quick Take Statutes

The condemnation in Miller occurred pursuant to the federal
version of what are called “quick take” statutes. These statutes, which also

exist in a majority of states, are designed to streamline
eminent domain proceedings by transferring title to the condemning authority
before all

contested issues raised by the condemnation have been
resolved. See Goodwill Community Chapel v. General Motors Corp., 503 N.W.2d
705,

707 (Mich. Ct. App. 19 93); 6 Julius L. Sackman, Nichols on
Eminent Domain § 24.10 (3d ed. 2005). In the early years, title to property
acquired

by eminent domain did not pass to the condemning authority
until all issues, including the amount of compensation to be paid, had been

resolved. The result was that condemnation proceedings
frequently were long, drawn-out affairs, which increased the costs of using
eminent

domain. This also gave property owners an incentive to
contest as many issues as possible, since the more issues they raised in the
pre-

condemnation hearing, the longer the condemning authority
would have to wait to gain possession of the property.

Governments eventually responded by enacting quick take
statutes. These statutes generally provide that if the government deposits with

the

#1209

court the estimated value of the property, and the court is
satisfied that the government has legal authority to condemn and that the
project is for a

public use, then the government can obtain title to the
property before a final judgment fixing the amount of compensation is reached.
As soon as

the title transfers, the condemned party must move out. The
condemnee collects the money deposited with the court, and then, as the
respondents

did in Miller , can continue to litigate the question of
whether the compensation is adequate. If the government’s estimate reflected in
the money

deposited with the court is too low, then the government
must make up the difference (with interest) once a final judgment is entered.
Miller

holds that if the government’s estimate turns out to be too
high, the government is entitled to sue to get the money back. (Note that this
is another

example of the principle of restitution.)

The Supreme Court rejected due process challenges to early
statutes that allowed the government to take title to property before the
amount

of compensation owed was finally determined. See, e.g.,
Bragg v. Weaver, 251 U.S. 57 (1919); Sweet v. Rechel, 159 U.S. 380, 395 (1895).
Thus,

it is settled that quick take procedures are constitutional,
provided the government deposits a fair estimate of just compensation with the
court

before title passes and the taking is otherwise legally
justified. But what if the condemnation is not legally justified, for example
because the

public use requirement is not met? Shouldn’t property owners
be entitled to a hearing to challenge the statutory authority for the
condemnation

and the government’s assertion of a public use before title
passes, even in the quick take situation? The Supreme Court has not addressed
this

question directly. See 6 Julius L. Sackman, Nichols on
Eminent Domain § 24.10[2] (3d ed. 2005); Nicole Stelle Garnett, The Public-Use

Question as a Takings Problem, 71 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 934,
970–74 (2003). Arguably, the scope of the public use requirement should be

inversely related to the due process entitlement to a prior
hearing. The broader the understanding of public use, the less the need for a
prior

hearing to determine if the taking is warranted. Thus, if
state courts and legislatures respond to Kelo by narrowing the scope of
permissible uses

of eminent domain, this should increase the rationale for
due process hearings before title transfers. In Norwood v. Horney , 853 N.E.2d
1115

(Ohio 2006), the Ohio Supreme Court, in the course of
narrowing the meaning of public use as a matter of Ohio law, also held that an
Ohio quick

take statute prohibiting judicial stays pending appeal to
challenge a public use determination violated state separation of powers
doctrine. Could

this be a harbinger of things to come? Courts in Rhode
Island and Maryland have also substantially curbed quick take condemnations in
recent

years. See Rhode Island Econ. Dev. Corp v. The Parking Co.,
892 A.2d 87, 107 (R.I. 2006); Mayor of Baltimore v. Valsamaki, 916 A.2d 324,
356

(Md. 2007).

The use of quick take authority has become an issue in the
on-going controversy about construction of a fence along the southern border of

#1210

the United States with Mexico. When construction of a border
fence was originally proposed (with bipartisan support) in 2005, Congress
enacted

a statute that directed the fence be built with the utmost
speed. Indeed, the statute authorizing the fence delegated authority to the
Secretary of

Homeland Security to “waive all legal requirements such
Secretary, in the Secretary’s sole discretion, determines necessary to ensure
expeditious

construction of [the fence].” P.L. No. 109–13, § 102, 119
Stat. 302, 206 (2005) (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. § 1103 note (2006).
Congress

nevertheless recognized that the Secretary could not waive
the Takings Clause, so it provided that courts would have jurisdiction to hear
claims

“alleging a violation of the Constitution of the United
States.” Id. § 102(c)(2)(A). Given existing federal quick take authority, this
meant that the

government could take the required land without a hearing
and settle the matter of compensation after the fence was built. The Obama

Administration concluded that a border fence was not needed,
and funding for construction was allowed to lapse. When President Trump

demanded that construction of “the wall” resume, the border
fence became a matter of intense partisan controversy. Congress refused to

appropriate funds to resume construction of the fence, and
the President responded by diverting funds from other military appropriations
to allow

construction to go forward. Opponents countered, in part, by
proposing legislation that would strip the Trump Administration of legal
authority

to use quick take procedures to acquire the necessary
property rights. See Eminent Domain Just Compensation Act, H.R. 4 40, 1 16th
Cong.

(2019) (preventing the federal government from obtaining
title to land for construction of a fence “until a final judgment has been
issued in a

condemnation proceeding initiated under judicial process”).

condemnation actions settle before trial. Curtis J. Berger & Patrick J.

government having to file an eminent domain action. Of course, the amount they
receive

in the negotiated sale is affected by the shadow cast by a
possible eminent domain action. Even if a voluntary transfer is not reached,
and the

government files a condemnation proceeding, most persons
settle with the government, usually after some preliminary legal skirmishing,
rather

than going to trial. In most cases that go to trial, the
amount of compensation will be fixed at some level between the government’s
figure and the

owner’s figure. Yun-chien Chang, An Empirical Study of
Compensation Paid in Eminent Domain Settlements: New York City, 1990–2002, 39
J.

Legal Stud. 201 (2010) (finding in a large-scale study of
New York condemnations that more than 50 percent of awards were for less than
fair

market value, 40 percent for more than FMV, and less than 10
percent for FMV; that extreme awards of less than

#1211

50 percent or more than 150 percent of FMV were common and
due to inaccuracies in the appraisal methods; and that compensation levels were

not correlated with other factors); see also Yun-chien
Chang, Private Property and Takings Compensation (2013). Both sides know this
and can

save legal fees by reaching a settlement that approximates
what the court would determine after a trial. From this perspective, the main

significance of quick take statutes is that they alter the
relative bargaining power of the government and the individual property owner.
By

allowing the government to take title to the property before
this issue is resolved, the government’s bargaining power relative to that of
the owner

is significantly enhanced. To the extent that due process
concerns require modifications in quick take procedures, the balance of power
will shift

back somewhat to property owners.

### D. REGULATORY TAKINGS

We turn to the most debated (but not the most litigated)
issue presented by the Takings Clause, which generally goes by the name of

regulatory takings. This arises when the government takes
action other than a formal exercise of eminent domain, and the property owner

contends that the effect of the action is such that the
government should pay compensation to owner, as if the government had proceeded
by

eminent domain. In other words, the owner claims the
government should have used eminent domain—with its requirement of just
compensation

—but did not. Better terms might be “inverse condemnation”
or “implicit takings.” The term “regulatory takings” may imply that the issue
arises

only when the government regulates the use of property in a
way that severely affects its value. While this is often the basis for a claim,
whether

the government has engaged in action that is functionally
equivalent to an exercise of eminent domain can also arise in contexts that do
not

involve use regulations, such as government-authorized
invasions or appropriations of property. (See Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid,
excerpted

and discussed infra.) Nevertheless, the phrase “regulatory
taking” is conventionally used to describe every type of implicit taking, so we
adhere

to that terminology in these materials.

### 1 .FOUNDATIONS

Virtually everything about the regulatory takings doctrine
is controversial, including its origins. There is little evidence that
regulations of

property—even quite severe ones—were thought to require
compensation in the colonial era or at the time of the adoption of the
Constitution.

See John F. Hart, Colonial Land Use Law and its Significance
for Modern Takings Doctrine, 109 Harv. L. Rev. 1252 (1996); William Michael

Treanor, The Original Understanding of the Takings Clause
and the Political Process, 95 Colum. L. Rev. 782 (1995). Some claim the
regulatory

takings doctrine can be traced in state court decisions
decided in the middle of the nineteenth century. See Kris W.

#1212

Kobach, The Origins of Regulatory Takings: Setting the
Record Straight, 1996 Utah L. Rev. 121 1. But most observers would agree that
the

Supreme Court’s 1922 decision in Mahon , excerpted here, is
where the modern doctrine began to take shape.

#### Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon

```



Supreme Court of the United States, 1922.



260 U.S. 393.



```

■ MR.
JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court. This is a bill in equity
brought by the defendants in error to prevent the Pennsylvania

Coal Company from mining under their property in such way as
to remove the supports and cause a subsidence of the surface and of their
house.

The bill sets out a deed executed by the Coal Company in
1878, under which the plaintiffs claim. The deed conveys the surface but in
express

terms reserves the right to remove all the coal under the
same and the grantee takes the premises with the risk and waives all claim for
damages

that may arise from mining out the coal. But the plaintiffs
say that whatever may have been the Coal Company’s rights, they were taken away
by

an Act of Pennsylvania, approved May 27, 1921 (P. L. 1198),
commonly known there as the Kohler Act. * * *

The statute forbids the mining of anthracite coal in such
way as to cause the subsidence of, among other things, any structure used as a

human habitation, with certain exceptions, including among
them land where the surface is owned by the owner of the underlying coal and is

distant more than one hundred and fifty feet from any
improved property belonging to any other person. As applied to this case the
statute is

admitted to destroy previously existing rights of property
and contract. The question is whether the police power can be stretched so far.

Government hardly could go on if to some extent values
incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such
change

in the general law. As long recognized some values are
enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power. But
obviously the

implied limitation must have its limits or the contract and
due process clauses are gone. One fact for consideration in determining such
limits is

the extent of the diminution. When it reaches a certain
magnitude, in most if not in all cases there must be an exercise of eminent
domain and

compensation to sustain the act. So the question depends
upon the particular facts. The greatest weight is given to the judgment of the
legislature

but it always is open to interested parties to contend that
the legislature has gone beyond its constitutional power.

This is the case of a single private house. No doubt there
is a public interest even in this * * *. But usually in ordinary private
affairs the

public interest does not warrant much of this kind of
interference. A source of damage to such a house is not a public nuisance even
if similar

damage is inflicted on others in different places. The
damage is not

#1213

common or public. Wesson v. Washburn Iron Co., 95 Mass. (13
Allen) 95, 103 (1866). The extent of the public interest is shown by the
statute to

be limited, since the statute ordinarily does not apply to
land when the surface is owned by the owner of the coal. Furthermore, it is not
justified

as a protection of personal safety. That could be provided
for by notice. Indeed the very foundation of this bill is that the defendant
gave timely

notice of its intent to mine under the house. On the other
hand the extent of the taking is great. It purports to abolish what is
recognized in

Pennsylvania as an estate in land—a very valuable estate—and
what is declared by the Court below to be a contract hitherto binding the

plaintiffs. If we were called upon to deal with the
plaintiffs’ position alone we should think it clear that the statute does not
disclose a public

interest sufficient to warrant so extensive a destruction of
the defendant’s constitutionally protected rights.

But the case has been treated as one in which the general
validity of the act should be discussed. The Attorney General of the State, the
City

of Scranton and the representatives of other extensive
interests were allowed to take part in the argument below and have submitted
their

contentions here. It seems, therefore, to be our duty to go
farther in the statement of our opinion, in order that it may be known at once,
and that

further suits should not be brought in vain.

It is our opinion that the act cannot be sustained as an
exercise of the police power, so far as it affects the mining of coal under
streets or

cities in places where the right to mine such coal has been
reserved. As said in a Pennsylvania case, “For practical purposes, the right to
coal

consists in the right to mine it.” Commonwealth v. Clearview
Coal Co., 100 A. 820, 821 (Pa. 1917). What makes the right to mine coal
valuable

is that it can be exercised with profit. To make it
commercially impracticable to mine certain coal has very nearly the same effect
for

constitutional purposes as appropriating or destroying it.
This we think that we are warranted in assuming that the statute does.

It is true that in Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, 232
U.S. 531 (1914), it was held competent for the legislature to require a pillar
of coal

to be left along the line of adjoining property, that with
the pillar on the other side of the line would be a barrier sufficient for the
safety of the

employees of either mine in case the other should be
abandoned and allowed to fill with water. But that was a requirement for the
safety of

employees invited into the mine, and secured an average
reciprocity of advantage that has been recognized as a justification of various
laws.

The rights of the public in a street purchased or laid out
by eminent domain are those that it has paid for. If in any case its
representatives

have been so short sighted as to acquire only surface rights
without the right of support we see no more authority for supplying the latter
without

compensation than there was for taking the right of way in
the first place and refusing to pay for it because the public wanted it very
much. The

protection of private property in the Fifth Amendment
presupposes that

#1214

it is wanted for public use, but provides that it shall not
be taken for such use without compensation. A similar assumption is made in the

decisions upon the Fourteenth Amendment. Hairston v.
Danville & Western Ry. Co., 208 U.S. 598, 605 (1908). When this seemingly
absolute

protection is found to be qualified by the police power, the
natural tendency of human nature is to extend the qualification more and more
until at

last private property disappears. But that cannot be
accomplished in this way under the Constitution of the United States.

The general rule at least is that while property may be
regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized
as a

taking. It may be doubted how far exceptional cases, like
the blowing up of a house to stop a conflagration, go—and if they go beyond the

general rule, whether they do not stand as much upon
tradition as upon principle. Bowditch v. Boston, 101 U.S. 16 (1879). In general
it is not

plain that a man’s misfortunes or necessities will justify
his shifting the damages to his neighbor’s shoulders. Spade v. Lynn &
Boston Ry. Co., 52

N.E. 747, 747 (Mass. 1899). We are in danger of forgetting
that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to
warrant

achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the
constitutional way of paying for the change. As we already have said this is a
question of degree—

and therefore cannot be disposed of by general propositions.
But we regard this as going beyond any of the cases decided by this Court. The
late

decisions upon laws dealing with the congestion of
Washington and New York, caused by the war, dealt with laws intended to meet a
temporary

emergency and providing for compensation determined to be
reasonable by an impartial board. They were to the verge of the law but fell
far

short of the present act. Block v. Hirsh, 256 U.S. 135
(1921); Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman, 256 U.S. 170 (1921); Levy Leasing
Co. v.

Siegel, 258 U.S. 242 (1922).

We assume, of course, that the statute was passed upon the
conviction that an exigency existed that would warrant it, and we assume that
an

exigency exists that would warrant the exercise of eminent
domain. But the question at bottom is upon whom the loss of the changes desired

should fall. So far as private persons or communities have
seen fit to take the risk of acquiring only surface rights, we cannot see that
the fact that

their risk has become a danger warrants the giving to them
greater rights than they bought.

Decree reversed.

■ MR.
JUSTICE BRANDEIS dissenting. The Kohler Act prohibits, under certain
conditions, the mining of anthracite coal within the limits of a city in

such a manner or to such an extent “as to cause the * * *
subsidence of * * * any dwelling or other structure used as a human habitation,
or any

factory, store, or other industrial or mercantile
establishment in which human labor is employed.” Act Pa. May 27, 1921, § 1 (P.
L. 1198). Coal in

place is land, and the right of the owner to use his land is
not absolute. He may not so use it as to create a public

#1215

nuisance, and uses, once harmless, may, owing to changed
conditions, seriously threaten the public welfare. Whenever they do, the
Legislature

has power to prohibit such uses without paying compensation;
and the power to prohibit extends alike to the manner, the character and the

purpose of the use. Are we justified in declaring that the
Legislature of Pennsylvania has, in restricting the right to mine anthracite,
exercised this

power so arbitrarily as to violate the Fourteenth Amendment?

Every restriction upon the use of property imposed in the
exercise of the police power deprives the owner of some right theretofore
enjoyed,

and is, in that sense, an abridgment by the state of rights
in property without making compensation. But restriction imposed to protect the
public

health, safety or morals from dangers threatened is not a
taking. The restriction here in question is merely the prohibition of a noxious
use. The

property so restricted remains in the possession of its
owner. The state does not appropriate it or make any use of it. The state
merely prevents the

owner from making a use which interferes with paramount
rights of the public. Whenever the use prohibited ceases to be noxious—as it
may

because of further change in local or social conditions—the
restriction will have to be removed and the owner will again be free to enjoy
his

property as heretofore.

The restriction upon the use of this property cannot, of
course, be lawfully imposed, unless its purpose is to protect the public. But
the

purpose of a restriction does not cease to be public,
because incidentally some private persons may thereby receive gratuitously
valuable special

benefits. Thus, owners of low buildings may obtain, through
statutory restrictions upon the height of neighboring structures, benefits
equivalent

to an easement of light and air. Welch v. Swasey, 214 U.S.
91 (1909). Compare Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U.S. 61 (1911);
Walls

v. Midland Carbon Co., 254 U.S. 300 (1920). Furthermore, a
restriction, though imposed for a public purpose, will not be lawful, unless
the

restriction is an appropriate means to the public end. But
to keep coal in place is surely an appropriate means of preventing subsidence
of the

surface; and ordinarily it is the only available means.
Restriction upon use does not become inappropriate as a means, merely because
it deprives

the owner of the only use to which the property can then be
profitably put. The liquor and the oleomargarine cases settled that. Mugler v.
Kansas,

123 U.S. 62 3, 668, 669 (1887); Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127
U.S. 678 (1888); see also Hadacheck v. Los Angeles, 239 U.S. 394 (1915); Pierce

Oil Corporation v. City of Hope, 248 U.S. 498 (1919). Nor is
a restriction imposed through exercise of the police power inappropriate as a

means, merely because the same end might be effected through
exercise of the power of eminent domain, or otherwise at public expense. Every

restriction upon the height of buildings might be secured
through acquiring by eminent domain the right of each owner to build above the

limiting height; but it is settled that the state need not
resort to that power. Compare Laurel Hill Cemetery v. San Francisco, 216 U.S.

#1216

358 (1910); Missouri Pacific Railway Co. v. Omaha, 235 U.S.
121 (1914). If by mining anthracite coal the owner would necessarily unloose

poisonous gases, I suppose no one would doubt the power of
the state to prevent the mining, without buying his coal fields. And why may
not the

state, likewise, without paying compensation, prohibit one
from digging so deep or excavating so near the surface, as to expose the
community to

like dangers? In the latter case, as in the former, carrying
on the business would be a public nuisance.

It is said that one fact for consideration in determining
whether the limits of the police power have been exceeded is the extent of the

resulting diminution in value, and that here the restriction
destroys existing rights of property and contract. But values are relative. If
we are to

consider the value of the coal kept in place by the
restriction, we should compare it with the value of all other parts of the
land. That is, with the

value not of the coal alone, but with the value of the whole
property. The rights of an owner as against the public are not increased by
dividing

the interests in his property into surface and subsoil. The
sum of the rights in the parts can not be greater than the rights in the whole.
The estate

of an owner in land is grandiloquently described as
extending ab orco usque ad coelum. But I suppose no one would contend that by
selling his

interest above 100 feet from the surface he could prevent
the state from limiting, by the police power, the height of structures in a
city. And why

should a sale of underground rights bar the state’s power?
For aught that appears the value of the coal kept in place by the restriction
may be

negligible as compared with the value of the whole property,
or even as compared with that part of it which is represented by the coal
remaining

in place and which may be extracted despite the statute. * *
*

Nor can existing contracts between private individuals
preclude exercise of the police power. “One whose rights, such as they are, are

subject to state restriction cannot remove them from the
power of the state by making a contract about them.” Hudson Water Co. v.
McCarter,

209 U.S. 349, 357 (1908); Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville,
189 U.S. 434, 438 (1903); Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., 240 U.S. 342
(1916).

The fact that this suit is brought by a private person is,
of course, immaterial. To protect the community through invoking the aid, as
litigant, of

interested private citizens is not a novelty in our law.
That it may be done in Pennsylvania was decided by its Supreme Court in this
case. And it

is for a state to say how its public policy shall be
enforced.

This case involves only mining which causes subsidence of a
dwelling house. But the Kohler Act contains provisions in addition to that

quoted above; and as to these, also, an opinion is
expressed. These provisions deal with mining under cities to such an extent as
to cause

subsidence of—

(a)Any public building or any structure customarily used by
the public as a place of resort, assemblage, or amusement,

#1217

including, but not limited to, churches, schools, hospitals,
theaters, hotels, and railroad stations.

(b)Any street, road, bridge, or other public passageway,
dedicated to public use or habitually used by the public.

(c)Any track, roadbed, right of way, pipe, conduit, wire, or
other facility, used in the service of the public by any municipal

corporation or public service company as defined by the
Public Service Law, section 1.

A prohibition of mining which causes subsidence of such
structures and facilities is obviously enacted for a public purpose; and it
seems,

likewise, clear that mere notice of intention to mine would
not in this connection secure the public safety. Yet it is said that these
provisions of

the act cannot be sustained as an exercise of the police
power where the right to mine such coal has been reserved. The conclusion seems
to rest

upon the assumption that in order to justify such exercise
of the police power there must be “an average reciprocity of advantage” as
between the

owner of the property restricted and the rest of the
community; and that here such reciprocity is absent. Reciprocity of advantage
is an important

consideration, and may even be an essential, where the
state’s power is exercised for the purpose of conferring benefits upon the
property of a

neighborhood, as in drainage projects (Wurts v. Hoagland,
114 U.S. 606 (1885); Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, 164 U.S. 112
(1896)); or

upon adjoining owners, as by party wall provisions (Jackman
v. Rosenbaum Co., 260 U.S. 22 (1922)). But where the police power is exercised,

not to confer benefits upon property owners but to protect
the public from detriment and danger, there is in my opinion, no room for
considering

reciprocity of advantage. There was no reciprocal advantage
to the owner prohibited from using his oil tanks in 248 U.S. 498; his
brickyard, in

239 U.S. 394, his livery stable, in 237 U.S. 171; his
billiard hall, in 225 U.S. 623; his margarine factory, in 127 U.S. 678; his
brewery, in 123

U.S. 6 23; unless it be the advantage of living and doing
business in a civilized community. That reciprocal advantage is given by the
act to the

coal operators.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The factual circumstances underlying _Mahon_ have been
much investigated by scholars. See, e.g., William Fischel, Regulatory Takings:
Law,

Economics, and Politics 25 – 47 ( 1995 ); Carol M. Rose,
_Mahon_ Reconstructed: Why the Takings Issue is Still a Muddle, 57 S. Cal. L.
Rev. 561 ( 1984 );

Robert Brauneis, “The Foundations of Our ‘Regulatory
Takings’ Jurisprudence”: The Myth and Meaning of Justice Holmes’s Opinion in
_Pennsylvania

Coal Co. v. Mahon_ , 106 Yale L.J. 613 ( 1996 ); Stewart E.
Sterk, The Federalist Dimension of Regulatory Takings Jurisprudence, 114 Yale
L.J. 203 , 208 –

210 ( 2004 ). Fischel reports that the practice among
anthracite mining companies in eastern Pennsylvania was to provide compensation
to surface owners

if their property was damaged by subsidence, even if the

```



1218



```

surface owner (or her predecessor in title) had waived the
support right. The litigation in _Mahon_ was motivated not by a desire to end
this practice, but

by the objections of the companies to another statute, the
Fowler Act, which required them to contribute to a fund to provide compensation
to surface

owners whose property was damaged by mining activity of
_other_ companies which had gone bankrupt. Even after their victory in the
Supreme Court,

the mining companies continued to pay compensation for
subsidence damage caused by their own operations. Why do you suppose they did
that?

2 .In a reprise of _Mahon_ , the Supreme Court in _Keystone
Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis_ , 480 U.S. 470 ( 1987 ), considered a
similar

Pennsylvania statute that made coal companies responsible
for subsidence damage caused by mining bituminous coal. Applying the approach
initially

adopted in _Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New
York_ , the next case you will read, the Court upheld this statute against a
takings claim.

Although the Court purported to distinguish _Mahon_ rather
than overrule it, there is little doubt that _Mahon_ can no longer be
considered good law with

respect to the question whether anti-subsidence laws give
rise to a takings claim.

3. _Mahon_ is still a very important decision, however,
   because it is generally regarded as the source of the regulatory takings
   doctrine—the idea that

some exercises of the police power “go too far” and hence
must be pursued through an exercise of eminent domain. A proper exercise of the
police

power—the power to regulate crimes, public nuisances, and
other activities that threaten the public health, safety, morals, or
welfare—does not require

that compensation be paid to those who must comply with the
relevant regulations. The power of eminent domain, in contrast, can be
exercised only if

the government pays just compensation for property taken.
_Mahon_ can be read as recognizing that there must be some limit or boundary on
the scope of

the police power, or else the state could simply use the
police power to acquire property for public use—but without having to pay just
compensation.

The regulatory takings doctrine recognized by the decision
is, from this perspective, simply a boundary-maintenance or anti-circumvention
principle

designed to preserve the basic distinction between two basic
powers of sovereign government. Few would quarrel with the general proposition
that as

long as we recognize these two powers, and as long as they
have very different consequences in terms of the government’s duty of
compensation, _some_

kind of judicial policing is necessary in order to preserve
the integrity of the boundary between them. (By the way, since only the states
are thought to

exercise a general police power, whereas the federal
government is said to exercise only enumerated powers, what is it that the
power of eminent domain

is being juxtaposed against when the federal government is
alleged to have engaged in a regulatory taking?)

4 .From this humble and rather uncontroversial foundation,
however, the doctrine of _Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon_ has grown into something
much

more controversial. The regulatory takings doctrine today is
the most powerful substantive constitutional constraint on governmental
interference with

property rights. Other doctrines, such as the Contracts
Clause and the doctrine of substantive due process, served this function in the
past. With

```



1219



```

the passage of time, however, the Court has come to apply
these other limits in a deferential fashion, at least insofar as they are used
to protect property

rights. The regulatory takings doctrine, especially after
1986 when William Rehnquist became Chief Justice of the United States, emerged
from the

shadow of these other doctrines to become the more important
constraint on government.

5 .One highly significant difference among these doctrines
is that the Contracts Clause and substantive due process mark boundaries beyond
which

the power of government may not extend. Hence, when these
limits are violated, the proper remedy is to enjoin the government action in
question. The

regulatory takings doctrine, in contrast, requires only that
the government pay “just compensation” when it adopts a regulation that goes
too far and

hence represents the kind of measure that should have been
accomplished by eminent domain. The proper remedy for a violation of the
regulatory

takings doctrine, consequently, is an award of damages from
the government equal to the “just compensation” that would have been paid if
the

government had condemned the property using the power of
eminent domain. In that sense, regulatory takings adopts a “liability rule”
rather than a

“property rule” approach to protecting property rights. See
Calabresi & Melamed, in Chapter IX; see also Abraham Bell & Gideon
Parchomovsky,

Pliability Rules, 101 Mich. L. Rev. 1 , 59 – 64 ( 2002 ).

6 .Note that the support right or “support estate” at issue
in _Mahon_ was, at least in functional terms, a covenant or servitude that ran
with two other

estates in land—the surface estate and the mineral estate.
At common law, surface owners enjoy a right of subjacent support, which
prohibits other

persons (including owners of subjacent mineral rights) from
excavating underneath the surface in such a way as to damage buildings or
endanger

persons and activities on the surface. (But if those
buildings or activities require more support than the land in its natural state
would provide, then one

in need of extra support has to negotiate for a servitude
for the extra support.) In _Mahon_ , the surface owners—the Mahons’
predecessors in interest—

had signed a deed conveying the mineral rights to the coal
company that included a covenant _waiving_ these common-law rights of subjacent
support.

The waiver was in effect a servitude running with the land.
The Kohler Act, in functional terms, reinstated the common-law support rights,
wiping out

the covenant or servitude the parties had negotiated. How
important is it to the Court’s decision that this particular waiver or covenant
has a property-

like name: the “support estate” (sometimes referred to in
Pennsylvania cases as the “third estate”)? How important is it to the Court’s
decision that this

particular covenant was explicitly negotiated and exchanged
(presumably for consideration) between the parties?

7 .In considering the broad run of cases, it seems
reasonably clear that it is not considered a taking for the government to
impose the functional

equivalent of a servitude on parties who conceivably could
have agreed to one as a matter of voluntary negotiation. See, e.g., Penn
Central, infra

(upholding historic preservation order); Gorieb v. Fox, 274
U.S. 603 ( 1927 ) (upholding open space restriction imposed by ordinance);
Welch v. Swasey,

```



1220



```

214 U.S. 91 ( 1909 ) (upholding height restriction on
buildings imposed by ordinance). Why should it be permissible for the
government to impose

servitudes on property owners without compensation, but a
taking for government to abrogate servitudes held by property owners without

compensation? Should it be regarded as a regulatory taking
for a court to abrogate restrictive covenants limiting houses in a subdivision
to single-family

occupancy under the changed circumstances doctrine (see
Chapter IX)? Did the Supreme Court, when it declared racially restrictive
covenants

unenforceable in _Shelley v. Kraemer_ (see Chapter IV),
commit a regulatory taking? The Supreme Court has entertained but so far not
come to any

definitive conclusion on the possibility of a judicial
taking. See Stop the Beach Renourishment, infra; see generally Barton H.
Thompson, Jr., Judicial

Takings, 76 Va. L. Rev. 1449 ( 1990 ).

8 .A careful reading of the opinions in _Mahon_ will reveal
that Justices Holmes and Brandeis (who more often agreed with each other on

constitutional questions), did not really disagree about the
factors to be considered in deciding whether a police regulation “goes too far”
and must be

regarded as an exercise of eminent domain. Both agreed that
the diminution in value caused by the regulation, the need to protect the
public against

nuisance-like harms, and reciprocity of advantage among
property owners are relevant factors to be considered. See if you can
articulate the reasons that

caused the two Justices to disagree about how each of these
factors should be applied to the Kohler Act. Are the disagreements based on
differences

about the characterization of each factor, about the proper
institution to determine the relevance of each factor, or about the presumed
importance of

each factor in this case?

9 .One specific ground for disagreement concerns the proper
unit of property against which to measure the effect of the regulation. Justice
Holmes

appears to assume that the correct unit of analysis is the
pillars of coal that must be left in place to support the surface. On this
view, the regulation

“takes” (or at least prevents the economic use of) the
entire property right. Justice Brandeis, in contrast, argues that the
appropriate unit of analysis is

“the whole property” of the coal company. From this
perspective, the regulation takes only a fraction of the property right. Which
perspective is better?

Under the Holmes approach, how narrowly should the
“property” be defined? Can the conception of “property” be sliced finer and
finer, until the

definition of property coincides exactly with the interest
affected by the regulation? Under the Brandeis approach, how far should the
“whole property”

of the company extend? To all its rights in the particular
column of space in which the complaining surface owner resides? To all rights,
mineral and

surface, in the immediate area? To all assets on the
company’s balance sheet?

10 .How would you explain the understanding that “blowing up
a house to stop a conflagration” is not regarded as a taking requiring the
payment

of compensation? Is this understanding consistent with
Justice Holmes’s emphasis on diminution in value, reciprocity of advantage, and
whether the

government action has taken a recognized property right? The
rule has been traced to the Great London Fire of 1666 , where the Lord Mayor of
London

```

hesitated to order the destruction of the Inns of Court
without the consent of the judges, with the result that the fire spread
disastrously. See Respublica v.

Sparhawk, 1 Dall. 357 , 363 (Pa. 1788 ). Does this provide
any hints about the rationale for the rule?

■ MR.
JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court. Acting under the Cedar Rust
Act of Virginia, Acts Va. 1914, c. 36, as amended by Acts

Va. 19 20, c. 260, now embodied in Va. Code (1924) as
sections 885 to 893, defendant in error, the state entomologist, ordered the
plaintiffs in

error to cut down a large number of ornamental red cedar
trees growing on their property, as a means of preventing the communication of
a rust

or plant disease with which they were infected to the apple
orchards in the vicinity. The plaintiffs in error appealed from the order to
the circuit

court of Shenandoah county which, after a hearing and a
consideration of evidence, affirmed the order and allowed to plaintiffs in
error $100 to

cover the expense of removal of the cedars. Neither the
judgment of the court nor the statute as interpreted allows compensation for
the value of

the standing cedars or the decrease in the market value of
the realty caused by their destruction whether considered as ornamental trees
or

otherwise. But they save to plaintiffs in error the
privilege of using the trees when felled. On appeal the Supreme Court of
Appeals of Virginia

affirmed the judgment. Both in the circuit court and the
Supreme Court of Appeals plaintiffs in error challenged the constitutionality
of the

statute under the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment and the case is properly here on writ of error.

The Virginia statute presents a comprehensive scheme for the
condemnation and destruction of red cedar trees infected by cedar rust. By

section 1 it is declared to be unlawful for any person to
“own, plant or keep alive and standing” on his premises any red cedar tree
which is or

may be the source or “host plant” of the communicable plant
disease known as cedar rust, and any such tree growing within a certain radius
of

any apple orchard is declared to be a public nuisance,
subject to destruction. Section 2 makes it the duty of the state entomologist,
“upon the

request in writing of ten or more reputable freeholders of
any county or magisterial district, to make a preliminary investigation of the
locality

* * * to ascertain if any cedar tree or trees * * * are the
      source of, harbor or constitute the host plant for the said disease * * * and
      constitute a

menace to the health of any apple orchard in said locality,
and that said cedar tree or trees exist within a radius of two miles of any
apple orchard

in said locality.” If affirmative findings are so made, he
is required to direct the owner in writing to destroy the trees and, in his
notice, to furnish

a statement of the “fact found to exist whereby it is deemed
necessary or proper to destroy” the trees and to call attention to the law

#1222

under which it is proposed to destroy them. Section 5
authorizes the state entomologist to destroy the trees if the owner, after
being notified, fails

to do so. Section 7 furnishes a mode of appealing from the
order of the entomologist to the circuit court of the county, which is
authorized to

“hear the objections” and “pass upon all questions
involved,” the procedure followed in the present case.

As shown by the evidence and as recognized in other cases
involving the validity of this statute, Bowman v. Virginia State Entomologist,

105 S.E. 141 (Va. 192 0); Kelleher v. Schoene 14 F.2d 341
(W.D. Va. 1 926), cedar rust is an infectious plant disease in the form of a
fungoid

organism which is destructive of the fruit and foliage of
the apple, but without effect on the value of the cedar. Its life cycle has two
phases which

are passed alternately as a growth on red cedar and on apple
trees. It is communicated by spores from one to the other over a radius of at
least

two miles. It appears not to be communicable between trees
of the same species, but only from one species to the other, and other plants
seem not

to be appreciably affected by it. The only practicable
method of controlling the disease and protecting apple trees from its ravages
is the

destruction of all red cedar trees, subject to the
infection, located within two miles of apple orchards.

The red cedar, aside from its ornamental use, has occasional
use and value as lumber. It is indigenous to Virginia, is not cultivated or
dealt in

commercially on any substantial scale, and its value
throughout the state is shown to be small as compared with that of the apple
orchards of the

state. Apple growing is one of the principal agricultural
pursuits in Virginia. The apple is used there and exported in large quantities.
Many

millions of dollars are invested in the orchards, which
furnish employment for a large portion of the population, and have induced the

development of attendant railroad and cold storage
facilities.

On the evidence we may accept the conclusion of the Supreme
Court of Appeals that the state was under the necessity of making a choice

between the preservation of one class of property and that
of the other wherever both existed in dangerous proximity. It would have been
none

the less a choice if, instead of enacting the present
statute, the state, by doing nothing, had permitted serious injury to the apple
orchards within

its borders to go on unchecked. When forced to such a choice
the state does not exceed its constitutional powers by deciding upon the
destruction

of one class of property in order to save another which, in
the judgment of the legislature, is of greater value to the public. It will not
do to say

that the case is merely one of a conflict of two private
interests and that the misfortune of apple growers may not be shifted to cedar
owners by

ordering the destruction of their property; for it is
obvious that there may be, and that here there is, a preponderant public
concern in the

preservation of the one interest over the other. And where
the public interest is involved preferment of that interest over the property
interest of

the individual, to the extent even of its destruction, is
one of the

#1223

distinguishing characteristics of every exercise of the
police power which affects property. Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887);
Hadacheck v.

Los Angeles, 239 U.S. 394 (1915); Village of Euclid v.
Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365 (1926); Northwestern Fertilizer Co. v. Hyde
Park, 97

U.S. 659 (1878); Northwestern Laundry v. Des Moines, 239
U.S. 486 (1916); Lawton v. Steele, 152 U.S. 133 (1894); Sligh v. Kirkwood, 237

U.S. 52 (1915); Reinman v. Little Rock, 237 U.S. 171 (1915).

We need not weigh with nicety the question whether the
infected cedars constitute a nuisance according to the common law; or whether

they may be so declared by statute. See Hadacheck v. Los
Angeles, supra, 41 1. For where, as here, the choice is unavoidable, we cannot
say that

its exercise, controlled by considerations of social policy
which are not unreasonable, involves any denial of due process. The injury to
property

here is no more serious, nor the public interest less, than
in Hadacheck v. Los Angeles, supra, Northwestern Laundry v. Des Moines, supra,

Reinman v. Little Rock, supra, or Sligh v. Kirkwood, supra.

[The Court then considered and rejected the contention that
the right of “ten or more reputable freeholders” to trigger an investigation
was

fatal. The freeholders] do not determine the action of the
state entomologist. They merely request him to conduct an investigation. In him
is

vested the discretion to decide, after investigation,
whether or not conditions are such that the other provisions of the statute
shall be brought into

action; and his determination is subject to judicial review.
The property of plaintiffs in error is not subjected to the possibly arbitrary
and

irresponsible action of a group of private citizens. * * *

Affirmed.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .Recall the excerpt in Chapter I where Ronald Coase claims
that in cases of incompatible land uses we should not ask which use is
inflicting

harm on the other. Rather, he says, the problem is a
“reciprocal” one: “The real question that has to be decided is: Should A be
allowed to harm B or

should B be allowed to harm A? The problem is to avoid the
more serious harm.” Whatever you think about this claim in the context of
classic

nuisances like air or water pollution, is this an apt
characterization of the situation in _Miller v. Schoene_ , where rust spores
spread by leaping alternatively

from cedar trees to apple trees? Does it follow that the
legislature would have been equally justified in ordering the destruction of
apple trees in order to

halt the spread of the disease? Several authors have argued
that _Miller v. Schoene_ undermines the notion of state action (versus
inaction) and the

public/private distinction, because, in Justice Stone’s
words, a decision by Virginia not to have cedars cut would have been “none the
less a choice.” See,

e.g., Louis M. Seidman & Mark V. Tushnet, Remnants of
Belief: Contemporary Constitutional Issues 27 ( 1996 ); Warren Samuels,
Interrelations

Between Legal and Economic Processes, 14 J.L. & Econ.
435

```

```

( 1971 ); see also Barbara H. Fried, The Progressive Assault
on Laissez-Faire: Robert Hale and the First Law and Economics Movement ( 1998
).

2 .Recent research by William Fischel casts doubt on the
“reciprocal” view of _Miller v. Schoene_ and raises some new questions. Fischel
finds that

there was a widespread and well-accepted custom that in
situations where a fungus leaps from species to species of plant in its life
cycle, the more

commercially significant plant always prevails. He terms
this norm “prices make rights.” The custom clearly applied to parasite-ridden
trees and other

crops. Would it be a good idea to apply this notion more
generally? (Does this notion in fact apply more generally?) This would be the
shortest of short

cuts to the result in _Kelo_ , supra, since presumably it
would allow any taking of property that would increase the size of the social
pie. But wouldn’t it

also confirm Justice O’Connor’s warnings about every Motel 6
being vulnerable to replacement by a Ritz-Carlton? At any rate, the
more-valuable-plant-

wins norm was an established background principle when
_Miller_ was decided. The 1914 legislation in question in _Miller_ passed the
Virginia House of

Delegates 88 to 0 with one Dr. Caspar Otto Miller, the
cedar-owning plaintiff in this case, casting a yes vote. It also turns out that
apple growers, who

procured the legislation after a nasty bout of cedar-apple
rust, had no objection to compensating cedar owners. In fact, the initial
version of the law

provided for compensation. But because some owners of cedar
trees which were more valuable as cut wood than as standing trees made spurious
claims

for compensation, the compensation provision was repealed.
For more on the case and the ins and outs of cedar-apple rust, see William A.
Fischel, The

Law and Economics of Cedar-Apple Rust: State Action and Just
Compensation in _Miller v. Schoene_ , 3 Rev. L. & Econ. 133 ( 2007 ); see
also Henry E.

Smith, Community and Custom in Property, 10 Theoretical
Inquiries L. 173 , 206 – 09 ( 2008 ) (offering a narrower interpretation of the
customary

background in _Miller v. Schoene_ ).

3 .The Court defers to the judgment of the Virginia
legislature that apple trees are of greater significance to the state economy
than cedar trees,

because apples are an important commercial product whereas
cedar trees are used mostly for ornamental purposes. This kind of reason is
enough to save

the statute from condemnation on substantive due process or
equal protection grounds. See, e.g., Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S.
483 ( 1955 ).

But does this answer the question whether the owners of
cedar trees should be compensated in full for their losses? Compare James
Buchanan, Politics,

Property, and the Law: An Alternative Interpretation of
_Miller et al. v. Schoene_ , 15 J.L. & Econ. 439 ( 1972 ) (arguing in favor
of compensation in _Miller_

on political economy grounds) with Samuels, supra, at 439 ,
445 – 48 (regarding Virginia statute as reallocation of tree owners’ property
rights). Recall

that in unintentional combination cases like _Wetherbee v.
Green_ (Chapter II), courts give the thing to the party who has supplied
greater value to the final

good, but award damages to the other party. Does this
suggest that although the apple tree owners have a better claim to keep their
trees, they (or the

state) should be required to compensate the owners of cedar
trees?

```



1225



```

4 .Although _Miller v. Schoene_ was decided only six years
after _Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon_ , most of the factors addressed by Justice
Holmes in

the earlier decision play no role here. Diminution in value
is barely mentioned, likewise reciprocity of advantage or whether the law
destroys a distinct

property right. Would consideration of these factors
strengthen the case in favor of compensation for the owners of the cedar trees?
Why do you suppose

they were ignored? The Court does mention a number of
decisions upholding regulations of “noxious uses,” including _Mugler v. Kansas_
, 123 U.S. 623

( 1887 ) (distillery); _Northwestern Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde
Park_ , 97 U.S. 659 ( 1878 ) (fertilizer plant); _Reinman v. Little Rock_ , 237
U.S. 171 ( 1915 ) (livery

stable); and _Hadacheck v. Sebastian_ , 239 U.S. 394 ( 1915
) (brick yard). But the Court insists an activity need not be a nuisance at
common law in order

to be subject to destruction at the direction of the state
without any compensation. What then is the basis for the decision? Are the
conflagration cases,

mentioned in _Pennsylvania Coal_ and discussed briefly in
Note 10 after that case, relevant here? Is the appearance of cedar rust an
emergency that

requires immediate destruction of property in order to
prevent a catastrophe for the entire community?

5 .In the spring of 2011 , the Mississippi River rose to
dangerously high levels, threatening to overflow a levee protecting the city of
Cairo, Illinois.

To protect Cairo from being flooded, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers decided to open a hole in the levee further downstream, flooding some
130 , 000

acres of farmland in Missouri. A federal court refused to
enjoin the Corps from taking this action, _Missouri ex rel. Koster v. U.S. Army
Corps of

Engineers_ , 2011 WL 1630339 (E.D. Mo.), but noted that the
question whether the owners of the farmland would be entitled to compensation
was not

presented. Interestingly, it appears that under an earlier
version of the same flood control plan the federal government had acquired, in
some cases by

condemnation, flowage easements that allowed the Army Corps
to flood the farmland in an emergency. See Story v. Marsh, 732 F. 2 d 1375 ,
1384 ( 8 th

Cir. 1984 ). Given the statement in _Miller v. Schoene_ that
the government is free to destroy one class of property in order to save
another which is of

greater value, why might the federal government decide to
purchase or condemn flowage easements rather than rely on its power to
regulate? Does this

judgment suggest that _Miller v. Schoene_ was wrongly
decided? Or should the decision whether to compensate in the
destroy-one-to-save-another context

be left to government discretion?

Academic Perspectives on Regulatory Takings

The regulatory takings doctrine, not surprisingly, has
generated considerable academic commentary seeking to develop a more systematic

account of the purposes and proper implementation of the
doctrine. Broadly speaking, academic “takings” theories fall into three
categories.

One type of theory, which is doctrinal in nature, attempts
to define more precisely the distinction between governmental powers, and in

particular the distinction between the power of eminent
domain and the police power. Pennsylvania Coal can be read as saying that it is

necessary

#1226

to draw a line between these powers, because eminent domain
requires that compensation be paid whereas the police power does not. This

creates a temptation for the government to evade its
obligation to compensate by characterizing measures that should proceed by
eminent domain

(or voluntary purchase of property) as a police power
regulation. Thus, we need an anti-circumvention doctrine that prevents the
government

from skirting its obligation to pay just compensation in
appropriate circumstances.

Professor Joseph Sax of Berkeley Law School made notable
contributions to this school of thought. His first attempt to characterize the

boundary line between the police power and eminent domain
drew a distinction between actions taken by the government when acting in an

“enterprise” capacity, where compensation was required, and
actions taken in “mediating” between incompatible uses of property, where no

compensation was required. Joseph L. Sax, Takings and the
Police Power, 74 Yale L.J. 36 (1964). Later, he modified the theory by arguing
that

any government action that seeks to regulate externalities
associated with the use of property should be regarded as a noncompensable
police

power measure. Joseph L. Sax, Takings, Private Property and
Public Rights, 81 Yale L.J. 149 (1971). A less conceptual approach to

distinguishing among governmental powers posits that courts
should start with ideal-typical situations governed by one power or the other,
and

then reason by analogy from the settled understandings in
fitting novel situations into the picture. See David A. Dana & Thomas W.
Merrill,

Property: Takings 86–164 (2002). This approach can be
particularized even further by observing that the power of eminent domain is
invariably

used to acquire interests that are “actually recognized as
traded in a market in the community in which it is located.” Steven J. Eagle,
Regulatory

Takings § 7.7(e)(5) (4th ed. 2009); see Thomas W. Merrill,
The Eagle Theory, 9 Brigham-Kanner Prop. Rts. J. 17 (2020). For example, if the

government adopts a regulation that has the effect of
causing a compulsory transfer of a leasehold or an easement in gross—interests
that are

exchanged in the relevant local community and are sometimes
acquired using eminent domain—the regulation would be declared a regulatory

taking. But if the regulation does not conform to an
interest that is tradeable on a stand-alone basis, such as a regulation
requiring the use of

certain building materials or imposing a restriction on the
height in which buildings can be constructed, it would be regarded a police
measure

that does not require any payment of compensation, because
it does not correspond to any interest traded on a stand-alone basis or
acquired by

eminent domain. Of course, which interests are traded on a
stand-alone basis is partly a function of which interests are legally
recognized. If the

states are given discretion to define or redefine which
interests are legally recognized, they may be able to influence the outcome of
regulatory

takings controversies, at least in close cases. Still, a
blatant attempt by a state to declare a commonly exchanged type of right “not
property”

would presumably be seen as an

#1227

attempt to evade the Constitution, and would be disregarded
by the courts.

Note that it is implicit in each of these doctrinal
approaches that government powers do not overlap. Either the action is an
exercise of

eminent domain or an exercise of the police power; it cannot
be both. Likewise, either the action is an exercise of the power of taxation or
an

exercise of eminent domain; it cannot be both.

A second type of academic theory focuses on the impact of
the government action on the property owner and posits that the regulatory

takings doctrine is designed to redress actions that have an
unfair distributional impact for the owner. This approach draws inspiration
from the

statement in Armstrong v. United States , 364 U.S. 40, 49
(1960), that the government should not “forc[e] some people alone to bear
public

burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne
by the public as a whole.” Of course, different people have different ideas
about what

makes for unfair distribution.

One notable theory grounded in distributional concerns,
which is probably the most famous article ever written about the takings
problem,

is Frank I. Michelman, Property, Utility, and Fairness:
Comments on the Ethical Foundations of “Just Compensation” Law, 80 Harv. L.
Rev. 1 165

(1967). Michelman sought to derive rules of thumb for
assessing takings claims from utilitarian social theory and John Rawls’s theory
of justice.

He developed the concept of “demoralization costs,” which he
defined as the psychological pain incurred by owners and their sympathizers
from

government action that reduces the value of their property,
plus the foregone investment caused by the fear of such reductions in value. He

argued that whenever demoralization costs would be higher
than what he called “settlement costs”—the costs of paying compensation and

administering a compensation system—then the government
should pay compensation to owners for its actions. A very different conception
of

unfair distribution was articulated some years later by
Richard Epstein in Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain
(1985).

Epstein argued that all government actions that disturb the
existing distribution of wealth are constitutionally problematic. Thus, unless
the

government is redressing a wrong committed by an owner, for
example the commission of a nuisance, or can show that its action provides

“implicit in kind compensation” to all owners, compensation
is always required. Both the Michelman and Epstein theories imply that very

general government regulations can qualify as takings.
Another approach grounded in distributional concerns would limit the scope of
protection

to measures that “single out” a relatively small number of
owners for uniquely severe burdens while providing general benefits to everyone
else.

See, e.g., Saul Levmore, Takings, Torts, and Special
Interests, 77 Va. L. Rev. 1333, 1344–45 (1991). Measures having a general
impact on

significant numbers of owners, on this view, would not
require compensation because they would be presumed to be subject to

#1228

effective control by the political process. Other efforts to
systematize regulatory takings law from a distributional perspective include
Andrea L.

Peterson, The Takings Clause: In Search of Underlying
Principles Part I—A Critique of Current Takings Clause Doctrine, 77 Cal. L.
Rev. 1299

(1989) and Nestor M. Davison, The Problem of Equality in
Takings, 102 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1, 24–27 (2008).

One implication of the various distributional theories is
that the judiciary must develop a comprehensive understanding about when

redistribution from A to B, or from A to many Bs, or from
many As to B, is just. In other words, in order to decide takings cases we need
a

theory of distributive justice, or perhaps more accurately,
a theory about when a system of adversarial litigation can be used to rectify
departures

from what a theory of distributive justice would indicate is
just. This is a tall order for judges—especially since commentators cannot
agree

among themselves about a theory of distributive justice or
about the proper role of the courts in addressing deviations from what a theory
of

distributive justice would require. Note further that under
the various distributional theories it does not matter what sort of power the
government

is exercising in determining whether it has committed a
taking. A government tax that has a sufficiently idiosyncratic distributional
effect might

be condemned as a taking. See, e.g., Eric Kades, Drawing the
Line Between Taxes and Takings: The Continuous Burdens Principle and Its

Broader Application, 97 Nw. U. L. Rev. 189, 223–24 (2002);
Eduardo Moisés Peñalver, Regulatory Taxings, 104 Colum. L. Rev. 2182 (2004);

Abraham Bell & Gideon Parchomovsky, The Uselessness of
Public Use, 106 Colum. L. Rev. 1412, 1432 (2006). Similarly, an exercise of the

police power can be condemned as a taking if it violates
whatever norm we adopt for identifying troublesome redistributions. Conceptual

distinctions grounded in history are irrelevant on this
view. The task is to derive doctrinal rules and standards directly from
abstract principles

about just distribution and the institutional capacities of
courts.

A third type of academic theory focuses on the government,
and how a compensation requirement might improve the functioning of the

government. One theme here is that compensation may improve
the efficiency of government by requiring the government to “internalize” the

costs its regulations impose on property owners. If the
government can impose regulations without regard to the costs imposed on
owners, it may

suffer from the “fiscal illusion” that these regulations are
costless, with the result that the government will engage in excessive
regulation. In

contrast, if the government must compensate for losses
incurred by owners, the government will impose only those regulations that
yield more in

benefits to society than the costs imposed on owners. See,
e.g., Jack L. Knetsch & Thomas E. Borcherding, Expropriation of Private
Property and

the Basis for Compensation, 29 U. Toronto L.J. 237, 242–44
(1979). The cost internalization argument has widespread appeal among skeptics

about government regulation, as illustrated by

#1229

legislative initiatives proposed in many states that would
require government to pay compensation for any decline in property values above
a

certain threshold attributable to government regulation.

The cost internalization argument has its strong critics,
however. One objection is that cost internalization works both ways. The

government should have an incentive not to impose
unnecessary costs on property owners, but property owners should also have an
incentive not

to impose unnecessary costs on everyone else, by polluting
for example. Thus, requiring that the government compensate owners for every

regulation that reduces the value of the owner’s property
would undermine the effectiveness of government efforts to stop property owners
from

imposing harms on others. See Louis Kaplow, An Economic
Analysis of Legal Transitions, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 509 (1986); Lawrence Blume et
al.,

The Taking of Land: When Should Compensation be Paid?, 99
Q.J. Econ. 71, 90–91 (1984). This objection suggests that the cost
internalization

argument is contingent on who is in greater need of cost
internalization: the government or the property owner. As such, the idea may
simply re-

frame the debate about where to draw the line between
compensable and noncompensable government action without providing a clear
answer. It

is also fair to question whether government agents respond
systematically to incentives for cost internalization, given that taxpayers
rather than

government officials ultimately foot the bill. Daryl J.
Levinson, Making Governments Pay: Markets, Politics, and the Allocation of

Constitutional Costs, 67 U. Chi. L. Rev. 345 (2000); see
also Yun-chien Chang, Empire Building and Fiscal Illusion? An Empirical Study
of

Government Official Behaviors in Takings, 6 J. Empirical
Legal Stud. 541 (2009) (presenting empirical study suggesting that Taiwanese
officials

respond more to political than to economic considerations in
determining compensation for condemnations).

Another strand of academic thought that focuses on
government behavior adopts something of the opposite concern—that the
government

will under-regulate unless it is required to compensate
property owners. The argument here is that property owners who do not receive

compensation when the government regulates them in a way
that significantly affects their property values will form a powerful lobby
that can

block the regulation. Compensation neutralizes intense
opposition to government policies that promote the general welfare. Daniel
Farber,

Economic Analysis and Just Compensation, 12 Int’l Rev. L.
& Econ. 125 (1992); Glynn S. Lunney, Jr., A Critical Reexamination of the
Takings

Jurisprudence, 90 Mich. L. Rev. 1892, 1954 –63 (1992).
Compensation on this view is like pork barrel spending or earmarks that buy off

opposition and make government regulation that promotes the
general welfare possible.

Which if any of these theories supports the outcomes in
Pennsylvania Coal and Miller v. Schoene? Which suggests that either or both of

these cases were wrongly decided? Consider how these various

#1230

theories may have influenced the Court in the following
landmark decision that effectively re-wrote regulatory takings law.

### 2 .THE “AD HOC” APPROACH

#### Penn Central Transportation Company v. City of New York

```



Supreme Court of the United States, 1978.



438 U.S. 104.



```

■ MR.
JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court. The question presented is
whether a city may, as part of a comprehensive program to

preserve historic landmarks and historic districts, place
restrictions on the development of individual historic landmarks—in addition to
those

imposed by applicable zoning ordinances—without effecting a
“taking” requiring the payment of “just compensation.” * * *

I

A

Over the past 50 years, all 50 States and over 500
municipalities have enacted laws to encourage or require the preservation of
buildings and

areas with historic or aesthetic importance. These
nationwide legislative efforts have been precipitated by two concerns. The
first is recognition

that, in recent years, large numbers of historic structures,
landmarks, and areas have been destroyed without adequate consideration of
either the

values represented therein or the possibility of preserving
the destroyed properties for use in economically productive ways. The second is
a

widely shared belief that structures with special historic,
cultural, or architectural significance enhance the quality of life for all. *

New York City, responding to similar concerns and acting
pursuant to a New York State enabling Act, adopted its Landmarks Preservation

Law in 1965. See N.Y.C. Admin. Code, ch. 8–A, § 205–1.0 et
seq. (1976). * * *

The New York City law is typical of many urban landmark laws
in that its primary method of achieving its goals is not by acquisitions of

historic properties, but rather by involving public entities
in land-use decisions affecting these properties * * * While the law does place
special

restrictions on landmark properties as a necessary feature
to the attainment of its larger objectives, the major theme of the law is to
ensure the

owners of any such properties both a “reasonable return” on
their investments and maximum latitude to use their parcels for purposes not

inconsistent with the preservation goals.

The operation of the law can be briefly summarized. The
primary responsibility for administering the law is vested in the Landmarks

Preservation Commission (Commission), a broad based,
11-member

#1231

agency assisted by a technical staff. The Commission first
performs the function, critical to any landmark preservation effort, of
identifying

properties and areas that have “a special character or
special historical or aesthetic interest or value as part of the development,
heritage or

cultural characteristics of the city, state or nation.” If
the Commission determines, after giving all interested parties an opportunity
to be heard,

that a building or area satisfies the ordinance’s criteria,
it will designate a building to be a “landmark,” situated on a particular
“landmark site,” or

will designate an area to be a “historic district.” After
the Commission makes a designation, New York City’s Board of Estimate, after

considering the relationship of the designated property “to
the master plan, the zoning resolution, projected public improvements and any
plans

for the renewal of the area involved,” may modify or
disapprove the designation, and the owner may seek judicial review of the final
designation

decision. Thus far, 31 historic districts and over 400
individual landmarks have been finally designated, and the process is a
continuing one.

Final designation as a landmark results in restrictions upon
the property owner’s options concerning use of the landmark site. First, the
law

imposes a duty upon the owner to keep the exterior features
of the building “in good repair” to assure that the law’s objectives not be
defeated by

the landmark’s falling into a state of irremediable
disrepair. Second, the Commission must approve in advance any proposal to alter
the exterior

architectural features of the landmark or to construct any
exterior improvement on the landmark site, thus ensuring that decisions
concerning

construction on the landmark site are made with due
consideration of both the public interest in the maintenance of the structure
and the

landowner’s interest in use of the property. * * *

Although the designation of a landmark and landmark site
restricts the owner’s control over the parcel, designation also enhances the

economic position of the landmark owner in one significant
respect. Under New York City’s zoning laws, owners of real property who have
not

developed their property to the full extent permitted by the
applicable zoning laws are allowed to transfer development rights to contiguous

parcels on the same city block. See New York City, Zoning
Resolution Art. I, ch. 2, § 12–10 (1978) (definition of “zoning lot”). A 1968

ordinance gave the owners of landmark sites additional
opportunities to transfer development rights to other parcels. Subject to a
restriction that

the floor area of the transferee lot may not be increased by
more than 20% above its authorized level, the ordinance permitted transfers
from a

landmark parcel to property across the street or across a
street intersection. In 1969, * * * [t]he class of recipient lots was expanded
to include

lots “across a street and opposite to another lot or lots
which except for the intervention of streets or street intersections f[or]m a
series extending

to the lot occupied by the landmark building [, provided
that] all lots [are] in the same ownership.” New York City Zoning Resolution
74–79

#1232

(emphasis deleted). In addition, the 1969 amendment permits,
in highly commercialized areas like midtown Manhattan, the transfer of all
unused

development rights to a single parcel. Ibid.

B

This case involves the application of New York City’s
Landmarks Preservation Law to Grand Central Terminal (Terminal). The Terminal,

which is owned by the Penn Central Transportation Co. and
its affiliates (Penn Central), is one of New York City’s most famous buildings.

Opened in 1913, it is regarded not only as providing an
ingenious engineering solution to the problems presented by urban railroad
stations, but

also as a magnificent example of the French beaux-arts
style.

The Terminal is located in midtown Manhattan. Its south
facade faces 42d Street and that street’s intersection with Park Avenue. At
street

level, the Terminal is bounded on the west by Vanderbilt
Avenue, on the east by the Commodore Hotel, and on the north by the
Pan-American

Building. Although a 20-story office tower, to have been
located above the Terminal, was part of the original design, the planned tower
was

never constructed. The Terminal itself is an eight-story
structure which Penn Central uses as a railroad station and in which it rents
space not

needed for railroad purposes to a variety of commercial
interests. The Terminal is one of a number of properties owned by appellant
Penn Central

in this area of midtown Manhattan. The others include the
Barclay, Biltmore, Commodore, Roosevelt, and Waldorf-Astoria Hotels, the Pan-

American Building and other office buildings along Park
Avenue, and the Yale Club. At least eight of these are eligible to be
recipients of

development rights afforded the Terminal by virtue of
landmark designation.

On August 2, 1967, following a public hearing, the
Commission designated the Terminal a “landmark” and designated the “city tax
block”

it occupies a “landmark site.” The Board of Estimate
confirmed this action on September 21, 1967. Although appellant Penn Central
had

opposed the designation before the Commission, it did not
seek judicial review of the final designation decision.

On January 22, 1968, appellant Penn Central, to increase its
income, entered into a renewable 50-year lease and sublease agreement with

appellant UGP Properties, Inc. (UGP), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Union General Properties, Ltd., a United Kingdom corporation.
Under the

terms of the agreement, UGP was to construct a multistory
office building above the Terminal. UGP promised to pay Penn Central $1 million

annually during construction and at least $3 million
annually thereafter. The rentals would be offset in part by a loss of some
$700,000 to $1

million in net rentals presently received from
concessionaires displaced by the new building.

Appellants UGP and Penn Central then applied to the
Commission for permission to construct an office building atop the Terminal.
Two

#1233

separate plans, both designed by architect Marcel Breuer and
both apparently satisfying the terms of the applicable zoning ordinance, were

submitted to the Commission for approval. The first, Breuer
I, provided for the construction of a 55-story office building, to be
cantilevered

above the existing facade and to rest on the roof of the
Terminal. The second, Breuer II Revised, called for tearing down a portion of
the

Terminal that included the 42d Street facade, stripping off
some of the remaining features of the Terminal’s facade, and constructing a
53-story

office building. * * * After four days of hearings at which
over 80 witnesses testified, the Commission denied this application as to both

proposals.

The Commission’s reasons for rejecting certificates
respecting Breuer II Revised are summarized in the following statement: “To
protect a

Landmark, one does not tear it down. To perpetuate its
architectural features, one does not strip them off.” Record 2255. Breuer I,
which would

have preserved the existing vertical facades of the present
structure, received more sympathetic consideration. The Commission first
focused on

the effect that the proposed tower would have on one
desirable feature created by the present structure and its surroundings: the
dramatic view of

the Terminal from Park Avenue South. Although appellants had
contended that the Pan-American Building had already destroyed the silhouette

of the south facade and that one additional tower could do
no further damage and might even provide a better background for the facade,
the

Commission disagreed, stating that it found the majestic
approach from the south to be still unique in the city and that a 55-story
tower atop the

Terminal would be far more detrimental to its south facade
than the Pan-American Building 375 feet away. Moreover, the Commission found
that

from closer vantage points the Pan Am Building and the other
towers were largely cut off from view, which would not be the case of the mass
on

top of the Terminal planned under Breuer I. * * *

Appellants did not seek judicial review of the denial of
either certificate. * * * Instead, appellants filed suit in New York Supreme
Court,

Trial Term, claiming, inter alia , that the application of
the Landmarks Preservation Law had “taken” their property without just
compensation in

violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and
arbitrarily deprived them of their property without due process of law in
violation of the

Fourteenth Amendment.

* * * The trial court granted * * * injunctive and
      declaratory relief, but severed the question of damages for a “temporary
      taking.” * * *

[The] Appellate Division, reversed. * * * The Appellate
Division concluded that all appellants had succeeded in showing was that they
had been

deprived of the property’s most profitable use, and that
this showing did not establish that appellants had been unconstitutionally
deprived of

their property.

* * * The New York Court of Appeals affirmed. * * * We
      affirm.

II

The issues presented by appellants are (1) whether the
restrictions imposed by New York City’s law upon appellants’ exploitation of
the

Terminal site effect a “taking” of appellants’ property for
a public use within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, which of course is made

applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment,
see Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U.S. 226, 239 (1897), and, (2),
if so,

whether the transferable development rights afforded
appellants constitute “just compensation” within the meaning of the Fifth
Amendment. We

need only address the question whether a “taking” has
occurred.

A

Before considering appellants’ specific contentions, it will
be useful to review the factors that have shaped the jurisprudence of the Fifth

Amendment injunction “nor shall private property be taken
for public use, without just compensation.” The question of what constitutes a

“taking” for purposes of the Fifth Amendment has proved to
be a problem of considerable difficulty. While this Court has recognized that
the

“Fifth Amendment’s guarantee... [is] designed to bar
Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all
fairness

and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole,”
Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960), this Court, quite simply,
has been

unable to develop any “set formula” for determining when
“justice and fairness” require that economic injuries caused by public action
be

compensated by the government, rather than remain
disproportionately concentrated on a few persons. See Goldblatt v. Hempstead,
369 U.S.

590, 594 (1962). Indeed, we have frequently observed that
whether a particular restriction will be rendered invalid by the government’s
failure to

pay for any losses proximately caused by it depends largely
“upon the particular circumstances [in that] case.” United States v. Central
Eureka

Mining Co., 357 U.S. 155, 168 (1958).

In engaging in these essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries,
the Court’s decisions have identified several factors that have particular

significance. The economic impact of the regulation on the
claimant and, particularly, the extent to which the regulation has interfered
with

distinct investment-backed expectations are, of course,
relevant considerations. See Goldblatt v. Hempstead, supra, 369 U.S., at 5 94.
So, too, is

the character of the governmental action. A “taking” may
more readily be found when the interference with property can be characterized
as a

physical invasion by government, see, e. g., United States
v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256 (1946), than when interference arises from some public

program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life
to promote the common good.

“Government hardly could go on if to some extent values
incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such

change in the general law,” Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon,
260 U.S. 393, 413

#1235

(1922), and this Court has accordingly recognized, in a wide
variety of contexts, that government may execute laws or programs that
adversely

affect recognized economic values. Exercises of the taxing
power are one obvious example. A second are the decisions in which this Court
has

dismissed “taking” challenges on the ground that, while the
challenged government action caused economic harm, it did not interfere with

interests that were sufficiently bound up with the
reasonable expectations of the claimant to constitute “property” for Fifth
Amendment purposes.

See, e. g., United States v. Willow River Power Co., 324
U.S. 499 (1945) (interest in high-water level of river for runoff for
tailwaters to

maintain power head is not property); United States v.
Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co., 229 U.S. 53 (1913) (no property interest can
exist in

navigable waters); see also Sax, Takings and the Police
Power, 74 Yale L.J. 36, 61–62 (1964).

More importantly for the present case, in instances in which
a state tribunal reasonably concluded that “the health, safety, morals, or
general

welfare” would be promoted by prohibiting particular
contemplated uses of land, this Court has upheld land-use regulations that
destroyed or

adversely affected recognized real property interests. See
Nectow v. Cambridge, 277 U.S. 183, 188 (1928). Zoning laws are, of course, the
classic

example, see Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365
(1926) (prohibition of industrial use). * * *

B

In contending that the New York City law has “taken” their
property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, appellants make

a series of arguments, which, while tailored to the facts of
this case, essentially urge that any substantial restriction imposed pursuant
to a

landmark law must be accompanied by just compensation if it
is to be constitutional. * * *

They first observe that the airspace above the Terminal is a
valuable property interest, citing United States v. Causby , supra. They urge
that

the Landmarks Law has deprived them of any gainful use of
their “air rights” above the Terminal and that, irrespective of the value of
the

remainder of their parcel, the city has “taken” their right
to this superadjacent airspace, thus entitling them to “just compensation”
measured by

the fair market value of these air rights.

Apart from our own disagreement with appellants’
characterization of the effect of the New York City law, see infra, the
submission that

appellants may establish a “taking” simply by showing that
they have been denied the ability to exploit a property interest that they
heretofore

had believed was available for development is quite simply
untenable. * * * “Taking” jurisprudence does not divide a single parcel into
discrete

segments and attempt to determine whether rights in a
particular segment have been entirely abrogated. In deciding whether a
particular

governmental action has effected a taking, this Court
focuses rather both on the character of the action and on the nature and extent
of the

#1236

interference with rights in the parcel as a whole—here, the
city tax block designated as the “landmark site.”

Secondly, appellants, focusing on the character and impact
of the New York City law, argue that it effects a “taking” because its
operation

has significantly diminished the value of the Terminal site.
Appellants concede that the decisions sustaining other land-use regulations,
which,

like the New York City law, are reasonably related to the
promotion of the general welfare, uniformly reject the proposition that
diminution in

property value, standing alone, can establish a “taking,”
see Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365 (1926) (75% diminution in value
caused

by zoning law); Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U.S. 394 (1915)
(87 1/2% diminution in value), and that the “taking” issue in these contexts is

resolved by focusing on the uses the regulations permit.
Appellants, moreover, also do not dispute that a showing of diminution in
property value

would not establish a taking if the restriction had been
imposed as a result of historic-district legislation, but appellants argue that
New York

City’s regulation of individual landmarks is fundamentally
different from zoning or from historic-district legislation because the
controls

imposed by New York City’s law apply only to individuals who
own selected properties. * * *

It is true, as appellants emphasize, that both
historic-district legislation and zoning laws regulate all properties within
given physical

communities whereas landmark laws apply only to selected
parcels. But, contrary to appellants’ suggestions, landmark laws are not like

discriminatory, or “reverse spot,” zoning: that is, a
land-use decision which arbitrarily singles out a particular parcel for
different, less favorable

treatment than the neighboring ones. In contrast to
discriminatory zoning, which is the antithesis of land-use control as part of
some

comprehensive plan, the New York City law embodies a
comprehensive plan to preserve structures of historic or aesthetic interest
wherever they

might be found in the city, and as noted, over 400 landmarks
and 31 historic districts have been designated pursuant to this plan. * * *

Next, appellants observe that New York City’s law differs
from zoning laws and historic-district ordinances in that the Landmarks Law
does

not impose identical or similar restrictions on all
structures located in particular physical communities. It follows, they argue,
that New York

City’s law is inherently incapable of producing the fair and
equitable distribution of benefits and burdens of governmental action which is

characteristic of zoning laws and historic-district
legislation and which they maintain is a constitutional requirement if “just
compensation” is not

to be afforded. It is, of course, true that the Landmarks
Law has a more severe impact on some landowners than on others, but that in
itself does

not mean that the law effects a “taking.” Legislation
designed to promote the general welfare commonly burdens some more than others.
The

owners of the brickyard in Hadacheck , of the cedar trees in
Miller v.

#1237

Schoene , and of the gravel and sand mine in Goldblatt v.
Hempstead , were uniquely burdened by the legislation sustained in those cases.

Similarly, zoning laws often affect some property owners
more severely than others but have not been held to be invalid on that account.
For

example, the property owner in Euclid who wished to use its
property for industrial purposes was affected far more severely by the
ordinance

than its neighbors who wished to use their land for
residences.

In any event, appellants’ repeated suggestions that they are
solely burdened and unbenefited is factually inaccurate. This contention

overlooks the fact that the New York City law applies to
vast numbers of structures in the city in addition to the Terminal—all the
structures

contained in the 31 historic districts and over 400
individual landmarks, many of which are close to the Terminal. Unless we are to
reject the

judgment of the New York City Council that the preservation
of landmarks benefits all New York citizens and all structures, both
economically

and by improving the quality of life in the city as a
whole—which we are unwilling to do—we cannot conclude that the owners of the
Terminal

have in no sense been benefited by the Landmarks Law.
Doubtless appellants believe they are more burdened than benefited by the law,
but that

must have been true, too, of the property owners in Miller,
Hadacheck, Euclid , and Goldblatt.

Appellants’ final broad-based attack would have us treat the
law as an instance, like that in United States v. Causby , in which government,

acting in an enterprise capacity, has appropriated part of
their property for some strictly governmental purpose. Apart from the fact that
Causby

was a case of invasion of airspace that destroyed the use of
the farm beneath and this New York City law has in nowise impaired the present
use

of the Terminal, the Landmarks Law neither exploits
appellants’ parcel for city purposes nor facilitates nor arises from any
entrepreneurial

operations of the city. The situation is not remotely like
that in Causby where the airspace above the property was in the flight pattern
for military

aircraft. The Landmarks Law’s effect is simply to prohibit
appellants or anyone else from occupying portions of the airspace above the
Terminal,

while permitting appellants to use the remainder of the
parcel in a gainful fashion. * * *

C

Rejection of appellants’ broad arguments is not, however,
the end of our inquiry, for all we thus far have established is that the New
York

City law is not rendered invalid by its failure to provide
“just compensation” whenever a landmark owner is restricted in the exploitation
of

property interests, such as air rights, to a greater extent
than provided for under applicable zoning laws. We now must consider whether
the

interference with appellants’ property is of such a
magnitude that “there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to
sustain

[it].” Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S., at 413.
That inquiry may be narrowed to the question of the severity of

#1238

the impact of the law on appellants’ parcel, and its
resolution in turn requires a careful assessment of the impact of the
regulation on the Terminal

site.

Unlike the governmental acts in Goldblatt, Miller, Causby,
Griggs , [ 369 U.S. 84 (1962),] and Hadacheck , the New York City law does not

interfere in any way with the present uses of the Terminal.
Its designation as a landmark not only permits but contemplates that appellants
may

continue to use the property precisely as it has been used
for the past 65 years: as a railroad terminal containing office space and
concessions. So

the law does not interfere with what must be regarded as
Penn Central’s primary expectation concerning the use of the parcel. More
importantly,

on this record, we must regard the New York City law as
permitting Penn Central not only to profit from the Terminal but also to obtain
a

“reasonable return” on its investment.

Appellants, moreover, exaggerate the effect of the law on
their ability to make use of the air rights above the Terminal in two respects.
First,

it simply cannot be maintained, on this record, that
appellants have been prohibited from occupying any portion of the airspace
above the

Terminal. While the Commission’s actions in denying
applications to construct an office building in excess of 50 stories above the
Terminal may

indicate that it will refuse to issue a certificate of
appropriateness for any comparably sized structure, nothing the Commission has
said or done

suggests an intention to prohibit any construction above the
Terminal. * * *

Second, to the extent appellants have been denied the right
to build above the Terminal, it is not literally accurate to say that they have
been

denied all use of even those pre-existing air rights. Their
ability to use these rights has not been abrogated; they are made transferable
to at least

eight parcels in the vicinity of the Terminal, one or two of
which have been found suitable for the construction of new office buildings.
Although

appellants and others have argued that New York City’s
transferable development-rights program is far from ideal, the New York courts
here

supportably found that, at least in the case of the
Terminal, the rights afforded are valuable. While these rights may well not
have constituted

“just compensation” if a “taking” had occurred, the rights
nevertheless undoubtedly mitigate whatever financial burdens the law has
imposed on

appellants and, for that reason, are to be taken into
account in considering the impact of regulation.

On this record, we conclude that the application of New York
City’s Landmarks Law has not effected a “taking” of appellants’ property.

The restrictions imposed are substantially related to the
promotion of the general welfare and not only permit reasonable beneficial use
of the

landmark site but also afford appellants opportunities
further to enhance not only the Terminal site proper but also other properties.

Affirmed.

#1239

■ MR.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS join,
dissenting. Of the over one million buildings and

structures in the city of New York, appellees have singled
out 400 for designation as official landmarks. The owner of a building might
initially

be pleased that his property has been chosen by a
distinguished committee of architects, historians, and city planners for such a
singular

distinction. But he may well discover, as appellant Penn
Central Transportation Co. did here, that the landmark designation imposes upon
him a

substantial cost, with little or no offsetting benefit
except for the honor of the designation. The question in this case is whether
the cost associated

with the city of New York’s desire to preserve a limited
number of “landmarks” within its borders must be borne by all of its taxpayers
or

whether it can instead be imposed entirely on the owners of
the individual properties. * * *

I

The Fifth Amendment provides in part: “nor shall private
property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” In a very literal

sense, the actions of appellees violated this constitutional
prohibition. Before the city of New York declared Grand Central Terminal to be
a

landmark, Penn Central could have used its “air rights” over
the Terminal to build a multistory office building, at an apparent value of
several

million dollars per year. Today, the Terminal cannot be
modified in any form, including the erection of additional stories, without the
permission

of the Landmark Preservation Commission, a permission which
appellants, despite good-faith attempts, have so far been unable to obtain.

Because the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment has not
always been read literally, however, the constitutionality of appellees’
actions

requires a closer scrutiny of this Court’s interpretation of
the three key words in the Taking Clause—“property,” “taken,” and “just

compensation.”

A

Appellees do not dispute that valuable property rights have
been destroyed. And the Court has frequently emphasized that the term

“property” as used in the Taking Clause includes the entire
“group of rights inhering in the citizen’s [ownership].” United States v.
General

Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373 (1945). The term is not used in
the

vulgar and untechnical sense of the physical thing with
respect to which the citizen exercises rights recognized by law. [Instead,
it]...

denote[s] the group of rights inhering in the citizen’s
relation to the physical thing, as the right to possess, use and dispose of
it... the

constitutional provision is addressed to every sort of
interest the citizen may possess. Id., at 377–378 (emphasis added).

While neighboring landowners are free to use their land and
“air rights” in any way consistent with the broad boundaries of New York

#1240

zoning, Penn Central, absent the permission of appellees,
must forever maintain its property in its present state. The property has been
thus

subjected to a nonconsensual servitude not borne by any
neighboring or similar properties.

B

Appellees have thus destroyed—in a literal sense,
“taken”—substantial property rights of Penn Central. While the term “taken”
might have

been narrowly interpreted to include only physical seizures
of property rights, “the construction of the phrase has not been so narrow. The
courts

have held that the deprivation of the former owner rather
than the accretion of a right or interest to the sovereign constitutes the
taking.” Id., at

378. Because “not every destruction or injury to property by
     governmental action has been held to be a ‘taking’ in the constitutional
     sense,”

Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S., at 48, however, this
does not end our inquiry. But an examination of the two exceptions where the

destruction of property does not constitute a taking
demonstrates that a compensable taking has occurred here.

1

As early as 1887, the Court recognized that the government
can prevent a property owner from using his property to injure others without

having to compensate the owner for the value of the
forbidden use.

A prohibition simply upon the use of property for purposes
that are declared, by valid legislation, to be injurious to the health, morals,

or safety of the community , cannot, in any just sense, be
deemed a taking or an appropriation of property for the public benefit. Such

legislation does not disturb the owner in the control or use
of his property for lawful purposes, nor restrict his right to dispose of it,
but

is only a declaration by the State that its use by any one,
for certain forbidden purposes, is prejudicial to the public interests.... The

power which the States have of prohibiting such use by
individuals of their property as will be prejudicial to the health, the morals,
or

the safety of the public, is not—and, consistently with the
existence and safety of organized society, cannot be—burdened with the

condition that the State must compensate such individual
owners for pecuniary losses they may sustain, by reason of their not being

permitted, by a noxious use of their property, to inflict
injury upon the community.

Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623, 668–669 (1887).

Thus, there is no “taking” where a city prohibits the
operation of a brickyard within a residential area, see Hadacheck v. Sebastian,
239 U.S.

394 (1915), or forbids excavation for sand and gravel below
the water line, see Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590 (1962). Nor is it
relevant,

where the government is merely prohibiting a noxious use of
property,

#1241

that the government would seem to be singling out a
particular property owner. Hadacheck, supra, at 413. Each of the cases cited by
the Court for

the proposition that legislation which severely affects some
landowners but not others does not effect a “taking” involved noxious uses of

property. See Hadacheck; Miller v. Schoene, 276 U.S. 272
(1928); Goldblatt.

The nuisance exception to the taking guarantee is not
coterminous with the police power itself. The question is whether the forbidden
use is

dangerous to the safety, health, or welfare of others. * * *

Appellees are not prohibiting a nuisance. The record is
clear that the proposed addition to the Grand Central Terminal would be in full

compliance with zoning, height limitations, and other health
and safety requirements. Instead, appellees are seeking to preserve what they
believe

to be an outstanding example of beaux-arts architecture.
Penn Central is prevented from further developing its property basically
because too

good a job was done in designing and building it. The city
of New York, because of its unadorned admiration for the design, has decided
that the

owners of the building must preserve it unchanged for the
benefit of sightseeing New Yorkers and tourists.

Unlike land-use regulations, appellees’ actions do not
merely prohibit Penn Central from using its property in a narrow set of noxious
ways.

Instead, appellees have placed an affirmative duty on Penn
Central to maintain the Terminal in its present state and in “good repair.”
Appellants

are not free to use their property as they see fit within
broad outer boundaries but must strictly adhere to their past use except where
appellees

conclude that alternative uses would not detract from the
landmark. While Penn Central may continue to use the Terminal as it is
presently

designed, appellees otherwise “exercise complete dominion
and control over the surface of the land,” United States v. Causby, 328 U.S.
256, 262

(1946), and must compensate the owner for his loss. Ibid.
“Property is taken in the constitutional sense when inroads are made upon an
owner’s

use of it to an extent that, as between private parties, a
servitude has been acquired.” United States v. Dickinson, 331 U.S. 745, 748
(1947).

Even where the government prohibits a noninjurious use, the
Court has ruled that a taking does not take place if the prohibition applies
over

a broad cross section of land and thereby “secure[s] an
average reciprocity of advantage.” Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S., at
415. It

is for this reason that zoning does not constitute a
“taking.” While zoning at times reduces individual property values, the burden
is shared

relatively evenly and it is reasonable to conclude that on
the whole an individual who is harmed by one aspect of the zoning will be
benefited by

another.

Here, however, a multimillion dollar loss has been imposed
on appellants; it is uniquely felt and is not offset by any benefits flowing
from

the preservation of some 400 other “landmarks” in New York
City.

#1242

Appellees have imposed a substantial cost on less than one
one-tenth of one percent of the buildings in New York City for the general
benefit of

all its people. It is exactly this imposition of general
costs on a few individuals at which the “taking” protection is directed. * * *
Less than 20

years ago, this Court reiterated that the

Fifth Amendment’s guarantee that private property shall not
be taken for a public use without just compensation was designed to bar

Government from forcing some people alone to bear public
burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as

a whole.

Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S., at 49.

As Mr. Justice Holmes pointed out in Pennsylvania Coal Co.
v. Mahon , “the question at bottom” in an eminent domain case “is upon whom

the loss of the changes desired should fall.” 260 U.S., at
416. The benefits that appellees believe will flow from preservation of the
Grand Central

Terminal will accrue to all the citizens of New York City.
There is no reason to believe that appellants will enjoy a substantially
greater share of

these benefits. If the cost of preserving Grand Central
Terminal were spread evenly across the entire population of the city of New
York, the

burden per person would be in cents per year—a minor cost
appellees would surely concede for the benefit accrued. Instead, however,
appellees

would impose the entire cost of several million dollars per
year on Penn Central. But it is precisely this sort of discrimination that the
Fifth

Amendment prohibits. * * *

C

Appellees, apparently recognizing that the constraints
imposed on a landmark site constitute a taking for Fifth Amendment purposes, do
not

leave the property owner empty-handed. As the Court notes,
the property owner may theoretically “transfer” his previous right to develop
the

landmark property to adjacent properties if they are under
his control. Appellees have coined this system “Transfer Development Rights,”
or

TDR’s.

Of all the terms used in the Taking Clause, “just
compensation” has the strictest meaning. The Fifth Amendment does not allow
simply an

approximate compensation but requires “a full and perfect
equivalent for the property taken.” Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United
States, 148

U.S., at 326. * * *

Because the lower courts held that there was no “taking,”
they did not have to reach the question of whether or not just compensation has

already been awarded. * * *

[I]n other cases the Court of Appeals has noted that TDR’s
have an “uncertain and contingent market value” and do “not adequately

preserve” the value lost when a building is declared to be a
landmark. French Investing Co. v. City of New York, 350 N.E.2d 381, 383 (N.Y.

1976). On the other hand, there is evidence in the record
that Penn

#1243

Central has been offered substantial amounts for its TDR’s.
Because the record on appeal is relatively slim, I would remand to the Court of

Appeals for a determination of whether TDR’s constitute a
“full and perfect equivalent for the property taken.”

II

Over 50 years ago, Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the
Court, warned that the courts were “in danger of forgetting that a strong
public

desire to improve the public condition is not enough to
warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of
paying for the

change.” Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S., at 416.
The Court’s opinion in this case demonstrates that the danger thus foreseen has
not

abated. The city of New York is in a precarious financial
state, and some may believe that the costs of landmark preservation will be
more easily

borne by corporations such as Penn Central than the
overburdened individual taxpayers of New York. But these concerns do not allow
us to

ignore past precedents construing the Eminent Domain Clause
to the end that the desire to improve the public condition is, indeed, achieved
by a

shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the
change.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .New York City’s historic preservation ordinance was
motivated in significant part by public outcry over the demolition of Penn
Station at 34 th

Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, a grand structure
with a classical colonnade matching the appearance of the Post Office building
across the

street. Penn Station was replaced by a nondescript structure
housing a relocated Madison Square Garden, with the railroad terminal moved
underground.

Given this background, it is not surprising that the
Landmarks Commission took a dim view of the proposal to build a modern tower on
top of Grand

Central Station, the only remaining grand historic rail
terminal building in Manhattan. See Gideon Kanner, Making Laws and Sausage: A
Quarter-

century Retrospective on _Penn Central Transportation Co. v.
City of New York_ , 13 Wm. & Mary Bill Rts. J. 679 ( 2005 ).

2 .On the occasion of the 25 th anniversary of _Penn
Central_ , a conference was held at Fordham Law School that included a panel
discussion by the

lawyers who argued the case and the law clerks who assisted
the Justices who wrote the opinions. See Looking Back at _Penn Central_ : A
Panel

Discussion with the Supreme Court Litigators, 15 Fordham
Envt’l L. Rev. 287 ( 2004 ). Among the interesting revelations are that Justice
Stewart advised

Justice Brennan’s law clerk (David Carpenter) that the
opinion should say as little as possible; that Justice Brennan spent one day
editing the draft

opinion; and that Justice Rehnquist’s dissent was already
written before the majority opinion circulated.

3 .Recall that both Justice Holmes and Justice Brandeis in
_Mahon_ seemed to believe that three factors were of primary importance in

distinguishing between a police power measure and an
exercise of the power of eminent domain: diminution in value, whether the
measure is designed

to regulate a nuisance, and reciprocity of advantage. Which
of the dueling

```



1245



```

opinions in _Penn Central_ is more faithful to this
doctrinal framework: Justice Brennan’s majority opinion, or Justice Rehnquist’s
dissent?

4 .Justice Brennan’s opinion stresses the “ad hoc” nature of
regulatory takings inquiries and does not appear to lay down any definitive
test for

determining whether a regulation “goes too far.” Shortly
after it was decided, however, the Supreme Court recast _Penn Central_ as
having prescribed a

“three-part” inquiry, looking to “the economic impact of the
regulation, its interference with reasonable investment backed expectations,
and the

character of the government action.” Kaiser Aetna v. United
States, 444 U.S. 164 , 175 ( 1979 ). Was this a misreading of _Penn Central_?
Does the opinion

suggest that diminution in value and investment backed
expectations are separate factors, or are they a single factor: “the extent of
the harm suffered by

the property owner in view of the owner’s investment-backed
expectations”? Gary Lawson et al., “Oh Lord, Please Don’t Let Me Be
Misunderstood!”:

Rediscovering the _Mathews v. Eldridge_ and _Penn Central_
Frameworks, 81 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1 , 47 ( 2005 ). And what exactly is
encompassed by the

“character of the government action”? Lower courts have
advanced a host of things that might be covered by this factor, including
elements emphasized

in _Mahon_ that do not otherwise appear in _Penn Central_
(except in the dissent). See Thomas W. Merrill, The Character of the
Governmental Action, 36

Vt. L. Rev. 649 , 661 – 71 ( 2012 ). Despite these
uncertainties, the Court has done little to clarify the ad hoc approach since
reformulating it as a three-

factor inquiry in _Kaiser Aetna_.

5 .However it is characterized, the _Penn Central_ approach
has not been friendly to takings claimants. Although the Court found a taking
in two

cases that purported to apply _Penn Central_ to federal
regulations in the decade after it was decided, see Kaiser Aetna v. United
States, 444 U.S. 164

( 1979 ); Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704 ( 1987 ); it has
never invalidated a state regulation of property under the ad hoc standard. See
Stewart E. Sterk, The

Federalist Dimension of Regulatory Takings Jurisprudence,
114 Yale L.J. 203 , 251 – 56 ( 2003 ). Empirical surveys of published opinions
applying _Penn

Central_ , which of course include only a small subset of
the universe of potential controversies, report that less than 10 percent of
such cases find a

taking. See Adam R. Pomeroy, _Penn Central_ After 35 Years:
A Three Part Balancing Test or a One Strike Rule?, 22 Fed. Cir. B.J. 677 ( 2013
). The

author also reports that courts are divided about whether
_Penn Central_ requires a balancing of three factors or simply means that
failure to prevail on

any one factor is fatal to the takings claim.

6 .Under the anti-circumvention theory, see Academic
Perspectives on Regulatory Takings, supra, does _Penn Central_ present a
relatively

straightforward question? If air rights, i.e., the right to
develop the column of space above an existing structure, are bought and sold in
the relevant

market on a stand-alone basis, then it would seem that the
government’s regulation has taken an exchangeable form of “private property.”
For evidence

of such transactions in urban areas, especially over
railroad trackage rights, see Thomas W. Merrill, The Compensation Constraint
and the Scope of the

Takings Clause, 96 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1421 , 1438 & n.
59 ( 2021 ). Should the Penn Central Company have concentrated on developing

```



1246



```

record evidence in support on the proposition that air
rights are bought and sold as a discrete bundle of rights in Manhattan?

7 .Consider the exchange between the majority and the
dissent over whether New York’s Landmarks Preservation Law is similar to
zoning. The

Supreme Court had held in the _Euclid_ case, excerpted in
Chapter IX, that zoning is not unconstitutional on its face, but might be open
to challenge in

particular applications. The dueling opinions in _Penn
Central_ focus largely on the question whether the Landmarks Preservation Law
is sufficiently

general to qualify as a type of zoning measure. One
difference between zoning laws and historic preservation laws is that the
former generally operate ex

ante, before significant development of property takes
place, whereas the latter operate ex post, after a structure has been built
which is subsequently

determined to be too valuable to modify. Given the ex post
nature of historic preservation, do such laws create a danger that they will be
used in an

oppressive or retaliatory fashion? In another prominent case
involving New York’s Landmarks Preservation Law, which upheld a landmark
designation

of a church on Park Avenue in the face of takings and free
exercise of religion claims, the Second Circuit, speaking through Judge Winter,
dropped the

following footnote: “The Landmarks Law made a cameo
appearance in a recent best-selling novel as a vehicle for political
retaliation against a clerical

official seeking to develop Church property. _See_ T. Wolfe,
_Bonfire of the Vanities_ 569 ( 1987 ) (‘Mort? You know that church, St.
Timothy’s?... Right

... LANDMARK THE SON OF A BITCH!’).” Rector of St.
Bartholomew’s Church v. City of New York, 914 F. 2 d 348 , 355 n. 3 ( 2 d Cir.
1990 ).

8 .One way of reading _Penn Central_ is that the government
can abrogate an owner’s right to destroy property without incurring any takings

liability, at least when the financial burden is not too
extreme. How important is the right to destroy in the traditional “bundle of
sticks” that makes up

full ownership of property? See Lior Jacob Strahilevitz, The
Right to Destroy, 114 Yale L.J. 781 , 794 – 96 ( 2005 ). Is abrogation of the
right to destroy a

more serious intrusion upon owner sovereignty than
regulating the uses to which property can be put? The Court has also held that
abrogation of the

right to sell personal property is not a taking, Andrus v.
Allard, 444 U.S. 51 , 67 – 68 ( 1979 ) (Congress can abolish the right to sell
eagle feathers without

creating takings liability). However, the Court has
suggested that elimination of the right to transmit property upon death will
presumptively be regarded

as a taking, Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704 , 717 ( 1987 ),
and has stressed in a number of cases that abrogation of the right to exclude
is regarded as

particularly serious for takings purposes. See Cedar Point
Nursery v. Hassid (excerpted infra and cases cited). Does the Court have a
principled basis for

deciding which incidents of property are more central to
ownership than others, such that elimination of the right is or is not regarded
as likely to trigger

takings liability? Or is the key point of _Penn Central_
that generalizations about these things are not possible, and it all depends on
context?

```



9 .Was it appropriate for the Court to toss in the
transferable development rights or TDRs awarded to Penn Central as one factor
to



```

```



1247



```

balance in deciding whether the regulation was a taking? Or
is Justice Rehnquist correct in assuming that the TDRs should be considered
only on the

question whether the company was given just compensation? In
a later decision, Justice Scalia argued that “[p]utting TDRs on the taking
rather than the

just compensation side of the equation... is a clever,
albeit transparent, device that seeks to take advantage of a peculiarity of our
Takings Clause

jurisprudence: Whereas once there _is_ a taking, the
Constitution requires just ( _i.e._ , full) compensation.... [yet a] regulatory
taking generally does not

_occur_ so long as land retains substantial (albeit not its
full) value.” Suitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 520 U.S. 725 , 747 – 48
( 1997 )

(concurring opinion). Building on this critique, could a
political jurisdiction like New York avoid all takings liability by providing
that just enough

partial compensation will be awarded in each case to permit
the court to conclude, on balance, that no taking has been committed? In an
ironic reprise of

the debate over the TDRs, investors who acquired Grand
Central to obtain the unused TDRs from the Penn Central Company sued the City
of New York

when it liberalized height restrictions for a developer in
the area around the terminal, in return for developer investments in
infrastructure and transit—

thereby rendering the TDRs largely valueless. The case
settled on undisclosed terms. See Christopher Serkin, _Penn Central_ Take Two,
92 Note Dame L.

Rev. 913 ( 2016 ). How would you assess a claim for a taking
of the Penn Central TDR’s under the ad hoc regulatory takings test of _Penn
Central_?

10 .Whatever you think of _Penn Central_ as a matter of
constitutional law, do you think the practice of denying compensation for
historic

preservation orders makes sense as a matter of policy? Some
commentators have worried that “freezing” the exterior design of notable
buildings,

without providing any compensation for lost development
rights, may have two unintended consequences: ( 1 ) persons who own buildings
that are

potential targets for historic preservation designation may
rush to demolish them before they are protected; and ( 2 ) persons who are
contemplating

commissioning the construction of new buildings may turn
down dramatic or innovative designs out of fear that they will be “rewarded”
with a historic

preservation designation, and hence will be locked into the
building for all time. See Mendes Hershman, Critical Legal Issues in Historic
Preservation,

12 Urb. Law. 19 , 28 ( 1980 ); Carol M. Rose, Preservation
and Community: New Directions in the Law of Historic Preservation, 33 Stan. L.
Rev. 473 ,

500 – 01 ( 1981 ); see also David A. Dana, Natural
Preservation and the Race to Develop, 143 U. Pa. L. Rev. 655 ( 1995 )
(considering a similar critique in

the context of natural preservation law); Strahilevitz, The
Right to Destroy, supra, at 817 – 18. Either or both of these incentive effects
could work to

impoverish the overall architectural quality of the
community. Providing compensation for lost development rights would presumably
eliminate these

incentive effects (at least in part). But of course, it
would also mean that there would probably be many fewer historic designations,
because of the

expense to the community of paying for lost development
rights.

Seeking Compensation for Regulatory Takings

The earliest regulatory takings cases we have considered—
Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon , supra, and Miller v. Schoene , supra—were

brought under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. It appears that in both cases ( Pennsylvania Coal is explicit about
this) the

plaintiffs sought an injunction against the operation of the
state statute because it did not provide just compensation. Neither case
suggests that

the plaintiffs could sue directly under the Takings Clause
and ask the court to order the state government to pay compensation. Under
established

principles of sovereign immunity, courts had no authority to
enter a judgment against a state government without its consent. The only
remedy

was to sue a state official in equity and ask the court to
enjoin the official from enforcing a law that did not comport with the
Constitution. See Ex

Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908) (allowing an injunction
against state officers who threatened to enforce a confiscatory rate order).

The Penn Central Court cast the regulatory takings doctrine
as resting on the incorporation of the Takings Clause into the Fourteenth

Amendment. This was foreshadowed many years earlier in
Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago , 166 U.S. 226, 239 (1897). But the
first explicit

invocation of the incorporation doctrine in the context of
the Takings Clause occurred in Penn Central. Bradley C. Karkkainen, The Police

Power Revisited: Phantom Incorporation and the Roots of the
Takings “Muddle,” 90 Minn. L. Rev. 826, 844–82 (2006). One effect of this was
to

direct attention to the text of the Takings Clause, which
provides for one remedy for its violation—the payment of just compensation
(“nor shall

private property be taken for public use without just
compensation”). As the Court came to recognize that the exclusive remedy for a
taking is

compensation, this touched off a number of difficulties
within regulatory takings doctrine.

One issue that took on prominence in the 1970s and 1980s
concerned a California Supreme Court rule that the only remedy for a state or

local law found to be a regulatory taking was an injunction
against the future enforcement of the law. Real estate developers complained
that the

rule was unconstitutional because it deprived them of just
compensation for the period in which they were litigating the regulatory taking
issue.

After several false starts, the Court agreed with the
developers in First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. Los
Angeles County,

482 U.S. 304 (1987). The Court held that the failure to
provide compensation for the period before the injunction was entered was a
temporary

taking and required the payment of just compensation for the
loss of development rights during this period. Although there was language in a

footnote suggesting that sovereign immunity was no barrier
to this result, id. at 316 n.9, this was at most dicta. The defendant in the
case was a

county, which (unlike the state government) does not enjoy
sovereign immunity. The Court later clarified that property owners could sue
counties

and

#1249

other local government entities for just compensation in
federal court under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at

Monterey, 526 U.S. 687 (1999). But § 1983 suits seeking
damages against state governments are barred by sovereign immunity.

Another development based on the compensation remedy had a
significant impact on the ability of property owners to bring regulatory

takings claims in federal court, even against a county or
local government entity under § 1 983. In Williamson County Regional Planning
Comm.

v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City , 473 U.S. 172, 195 (1985),
the Court held that since compensation is the exclusive remedy for a regulatory

taking, a property owner cannot bring a taking claim under
federal law until the owner has sought and been denied compensation under state

provisions for obtaining compensation. Standing alone, this
seemed only to promise more delay (which would give rise to compensation for a

temporary taking if the owner was ultimately successful).
But in San Remo Hotel, L. P. v. City and County of San Francisco , 545 U.S. 323

(2005), the Court held that any issues resolved in state
court proceedings seeking compensation must be given preclusive effect in a
subsequent

federal court proceeding. This created what was called the “
Williamson County trap”: The federal Constitution creates an action for a
regulatory

taking, and federal courts ordinarily stand ready to
vindicate federal constitutional rights; but under Williamson County regulatory
takings claims

against any state entity will ordinarily go no further than
state court (except for the rare case in which the Supreme Court agrees to
review the

state court judgment).

Property rights advocates were upset by the Williamson
County trap, and in Knick v. Township of Scott , 139 S. Ct. 2162 (2019), they

persuaded the Court to overrule this aspect of Williamson
County. Writing for a bare majority of five, Chief Justice Roberts
recharacterized the

nature of right established by the Takings Clause. It was
not, he wrote, the denial of compensation for a taking of property, as
Williamson County

suggested. Rather it was a taking of property unaccompanied
by a promise of compensation. “If a local government takes private property

without paying for it, that government has violated the
Fifth Amendment—just as the Takings Clause says—without regard to subsequent
state

court proceedings. And the property owner may sue the
government at that time in federal court for the ‘deprivation’ of a right
secured by the

Constitution.’ 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” 139 S. Ct. at 2162.

Knick opens the door to the filing of regulatory takings
claims against local governments directly in federal court under § 198 3. This
still

leaves the question whether regulatory takings claims can be
filed against a State and its agencies consistent with state sovereign
immunity. In

PennEast Pipeline Co., LLC v. New Jersey , 141 S. Ct. 2244
(2021), the Court held that sovereign immunity is no barrier to an action in
federal

court by a private pipeline company to condemn state-owned
lands or interests in lands. It may seem odd that that states cannot

#1250

invoke sovereign immunity to resist a taking of their own
land, but can invoke sovereign immunity to bar a suit for compensation when
they take

someone else’s land. Perhaps by some alchemy of precedent,
PennEast will lead to an abrogation of sovereign immunity when a state takes,
as

well as when it resists a taking. But only time will tell.

```

■
JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court. This case presents the
question whether a minor but permanent physical occupation of an

owner’s property authorized by government constitutes a
“taking” of property for which just compensation is due under the Fifth and
Fourteenth

Amendments of the Constitution. * * * The New York Court of
Appeals ruled that this appropriation does not amount to a taking. Because we

conclude that such a physical occupation of property is a
taking, we reverse.

I

[When cable television first came to New York City, cable
companies induced landlords to permit cable wires to be installed on the roof
and

down the side of their buildings by offering landlords 5% of
the gross revenues obtained from selling cable TV subscriptions to tenants
living at

the property. Later, New York enacted a statute prohibiting
landlords from interfering with cable installations or demanding payments from
either

tenants or cable companies. A state regulatory commission
ruled that landlords were entitled to a one-time payment of $1 as compensation
for

permitting such installations. Jean Loretto, who owned a
small rental building on the upper West Side of Manhattan, filed a class action
alleging

that the cable mandate was a taking of her property. The
installation at her building, in addition to wires suspended above the roof and
running

down the side of the building, consisted of two small silver
boxes and screws or nails securing the wire to the roof at two-foot intervals.]

#1251

Figure 10-6 303 West 105th Street, New York City, in 2006

II

The Court of Appeals determined that § 828 serves the
legitimate public purpose of “rapid development of and maximum penetration by a

means of communication which has important educational and
community aspects,” and thus is within the State’s police power. We have no

reason to question that determination. It is a separate
question, however, whether an otherwise valid regulation so frustrates property
rights that

compensation must be paid. See Penn Central Transportation
Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 127–128 (1978). We conclude that a

permanent physical occupation authorized by government is a
taking without regard to the public interests that it may serve. Our
constitutional

history confirms the rule, recent cases do not question it,
and the purposes of the Takings Clause compel its retention.

#1252

A

In Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City , supra,
the Court surveyed some of the general principles governing the Takings

Clause. The Court noted that no “set formula” existed to
determine, in all cases, whether compensation is constitutionally due for a
government

restriction of property. Ordinarily, the Court must engage
in “essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries.” Id., at 124. But the inquiry is not
standardless.

The economic impact of the regulation, especially the degree
of interference with investment-backed expectations, is of particular
significance.

“So, too, is the character of the governmental action. A
‘taking’ may more readily be found when the interference with property can be

characterized as a physical invasion by government, than
when interference arises from some public program adjusting the benefits and
burdens

of economic life to promote the common good.” Ibid.
(citation omitted).

As Penn Central affirms, the Court has often upheld
substantial regulation of an owner’s use of his own property where deemed
necessary

to promote the public interest. At the same time, we have
long considered a physical intrusion by government to be a property restriction
of an

unusually serious character for purposes of the Takings
Clause. Our cases further establish that when the physical intrusion reaches
the extreme

form of a permanent physical occupation, a taking has
occurred. In such a case, “the character of the government action” not only is
an important

factor in resolving whether the action works a taking but
also is determinative.

When faced with a constitutional challenge to a permanent
physical occupation of real property, this Court has invariably found a taking.
As

early as 1872, in Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co. , 13 Wall. (80
U.S.) 166, this Court held that the defendant’s construction, pursuant to state
authority,

of a dam which permanently flooded plaintiff’s property
constituted a taking. A unanimous Court stated, without qualification, that
“where real

estate is actually invaded by superinduced additions of
water, earth, sand, or other material, or by having any artificial structure
placed on it, so

as to effectually destroy or impair its usefulness, it is a
taking, within the meaning of the Constitution.” Id., 13 Wall. (80 U.S.) at
181. * * *

More recent cases confirm the distinction between a
permanent physical occupation, a physical invasion short of an occupation, and
a

regulation that merely restricts the use of property. In
United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256 (1946), the Court ruled that frequent
flights

immediately above a landowner’s property constituted a
taking, comparing such overflights to the quintessential form of a taking:

If, by reason of the frequency and altitude of the flights,
respondents could not use this land for any purpose, their loss would be

complete. It would be as complete as if the United States
had entered upon the surface of the land and taken exclusive possession of it.

Id., at 261 (footnote omitted).

#1253

As the Court further explained,

We would not doubt that, if the United States erected an
elevated railway over respondents’ land at the precise altitude where its
planes

now fly, there would be a partial taking, even though none
of the supports of the structure rested on the land. The reason is that there

would be an intrusion so immediate and direct as to subtract
from the owner’s full enjoyment of the property and to limit his

exploitation of it. Id., at 264–265.

The Court concluded that the damages to the respondents
“were not merely consequential. They were the product of a direct invasion of

respondents’ domain.” Id., at 265–266. See also Griggs v.
Allegheny County, 369 U.S. 84 (1962). * * *

Although this Court’s most recent cases have not addressed
the precise issue before us, they have emphasized that physical invasion cases

are special and have not repudiated the rule that any
permanent physical occupation is a taking. The cases state or imply that a
physical invasion

is subject to a balancing process, but they do not suggest
that a permanent physical occupation would ever be exempt from the Takings
Clause.

In short, when the “character of the governmental action,”
Penn Central, 438 U.S., at 124, is a permanent physical occupation of property,

our cases uniformly have found a taking to the extent of the
occupation, without regard to whether the action achieves an important public

benefit or has only minimal economic impact on the owner.

B

The historical rule that a permanent physical occupation of
another’s property is a taking has more than tradition to commend it. Such an

appropriation is perhaps the most serious form of invasion
of an owner’s property interests. To borrow a metaphor, cf. Andrus v. Allard,
444 U.S.

51, 65–66 (1979), the government does not simply take a
single “strand” from the “bundle” of property rights: it chops through the
bundle,

taking a slice of every strand.

Property rights in a physical thing have been described as
the rights “to possess, use and dispose of it.” United States v. General Motors

Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 378 (1945). To the extent that the
government permanently occupies physical property, it effectively destroys each
of these

rights. First, the owner has no right to possess the
occupied space himself, and also has no power to exclude the occupier from
possession and

use of the space. The power to exclude has traditionally
been considered one of the most treasured strands in an owner’s bundle of
property

rights.^12 See

#1254

Kaiser Aetna, 444 U.S., at 179–180; see also Restatement of
Property § 7 (1936). Second, the permanent physical occupation of property
forever

denies the owner any power to control the use of the
property; he not only cannot exclude others, but can make no nonpossessory use
of the

property. Although deprivation of the right to use and
obtain a profit from property is not, in every case, independently sufficient
to establish a

taking, see Andrus v. Allard, supra, at 66, it is clearly
relevant. Finally, even though the owner may retain the bare legal right to
dispose of the

occupied space by transfer or sale, the permanent occupation
of that space by a stranger will ordinarily empty the right of any value, since
the

purchaser will also be unable to make any use of the
property.

Moreover, an owner suffers a special kind of injury when a
stranger directly invades and occupies the owner’s property. As Part II–A,

supra, indicates, property law has long protected an owner’s
expectation that he will be relatively undisturbed at least in the possession
of his

property. To require, as well, that the owner permit another
to exercise complete dominion literally adds insult to injury. See Michelman,

Property, Utility, and Fairness: Comments on the Ethical
Foundations of “Just Compensation” Law, 80 Harv.L.Rev. 1 165, 1228, and n. 110

(1967). Furthermore, such an occupation is qualitatively
more severe than a regulation of the use of property, even a regulation that
imposes

affirmative duties on the owner, since the owner may have no
control over the timing, extent, or nature of the invasion.

The traditional rule also avoids otherwise difficult
line-drawing problems. Few would disagree that if the State required landlords
to permit

third parties to install swimming pools on the landlords’
rooftops for the convenience of the tenants, the requirement would be a taking.
If the

cable installation here occupied as much space, again, few
would disagree that the occupation would be a taking. But constitutional
protection for

the rights of private property cannot be made to depend on
the size of the area permanently occupied. Indeed, it is possible that in the
future,

additional cable installations that more significantly
restrict a landlord’s use of the roof of his building will be made. Section 828
requires a

landlord to permit such multiple installations.

Finally, whether a permanent physical occupation has
occurred presents relatively few problems of proof. The placement of a fixed
structure

on land or real property is an obvious fact that will rarely
be subject to dispute. Once the fact of occupation is shown, of course, a court
should

consider the extent of the occupation as one relevant factor
in

#1255

determining the compensation due. For that reason, moreover,
there is less need to consider the extent of the occupation in determining
whether

there is a taking in the first instance.

C

Teleprompter’s cable installation on appellant’s building
constitutes a taking under the traditional test. The installation involved a
direct

physical attachment of plates, boxes, wires, bolts, and
screws to the building, completely occupying space immediately above and upon
the roof

and along the building’s exterior wall.^16 * * *

Appellees raise a series of objections to application of the
traditional rule here. Teleprompter notes that the law applies only to
buildings

used as rental property, and draws the conclusion that the
law is simply a permissible regulation of the use of real property. We fail to
see,

however, why a physical occupation of one type of property
but not another type is any less a physical occupation. Insofar as Teleprompter

means to suggest that this is not a permanent physical
invasion, we must differ. So long as the property remains residential and a
CATV company

wishes to retain the installation, the landlord must permit
it.^17 * * *

Finally, we do not agree with appellees that application of
the physical occupation rule will have dire consequences for the government’s

power to adjust landlord-tenant relationships. This Court
has consistently affirmed that States have broad power to regulate housing
conditions in

general and the landlord-tenant relationship in particular
without paying compensation for all economic injuries that such regulation
entails. In

none of these cases, however, did the government authorize
the permanent occupation of the landlord’s property by a third party.
Consequently,

our holding today in no way alters the analysis governing
the State’s power to require landlords to comply with building codes and
provide utility

connections, mailboxes, smoke detectors, fire extinguishers,
and the like in the common area of a building. So long as these regulations do
not

require the landlord to suffer the physical occupation of a
portion of his building by a third party, they will be analyzed under the
multifactor

inquiry generally applicable to

#1256

nonpossessory governmental activity. See Penn Central
Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104 (1978).^19

III

Our holding today is very narrow. We affirm the traditional
rule that a permanent physical occupation of property is a taking. In such a
case,

the property owner entertains a historically rooted
expectation of compensation, and the character of the invasion is qualitatively
more intrusive

than perhaps any other category of property regulation. We
do not, however, question the equally substantial authority upholding a State’s
broad

power to impose appropriate restrictions upon an owner’s use
of his property. Furthermore, our conclusion that § 828 works a taking of a
portion

of appellant’s property does not presuppose that the fee
which many landlords had obtained from Teleprompter prior to the law’s
enactment is a

proper measure of the value of the property taken. The issue
of the amount of compensation that is due, on which we express no opinion, is a

matter for the state courts to consider on remand. * * *

■
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE WHITE join, dissenting.

* * * In a curiously anachronistic decision, the Court

today acknowledges its historical disavowal of set formulae
in almost the same breath as it constructs a rigid per se takings rule: “a
permanent

physical occupation authorized by government is a taking
without regard to the public interests that it may serve.” To sustain its rule
against our

recent precedents, the Court erects a strained and untenable
distinction between “temporary physical invasions,” whose constitutionality

concededly “is subject to a balancing process,” and
“permanent physical occupations,” which are “taking[s] without regard to other
factors that a

court might ordinarily examine.” * * *

[Section] 828 differs little from the numerous other New
York statutory provisions that require landlords to install physical facilities

“permanently occupying” common spaces in or on their
buildings. As the Court acknowledges, the States traditionally—and
constitutionally—

#1257

have exercised their police power “to require landlords
to... provide utility connections, mailboxes, smoke detectors, fire
extinguishers, and the

like in the common area of a building.” Like § 828, these
provisions merely ensure tenants access to services the legislature deems
important,

such as water, electricity, natural light, telephones,
intercommunication systems, and mail service. A landlord’s dispositional rights
are affected

no more adversely when he sells a building to another
landlord subject to § 828, than when he sells that building subject only to
these other New

York statutory provisions. * * *

[T]his Court long ago recognized that new social
circumstances can justify legislative modification of a property owner’s
common-law

rights, without compensation, if the legislative action
serves sufficiently important public interests. See Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 1
13, 134 (1877)

(“A person has no property, no vested interest, in any rule
of the common law.... Indeed, the great office of statutes is to remedy defects
in the

common law as they are developed, and to adapt it to the
changes of time and circumstance”); United States v. Causby, 328 U.S., at
260–261 (In

the modern world, “[c]ommon sense revolts at the idea” that
legislatures cannot alter common-law ownership rights).* * *

This Court now reaches back in time for a per se rule that
disrupts that legislative determination. Like Justice Black, I believe that
“the

solution of the problems precipitated by... technological
advances and new ways of living cannot come about through the application of
rigid

constitutional restraints formulated and enforced by the
courts.” United States v. Causby, 328 U.S., at 274 (dissenting opinion). I
would affirm

the judgment and uphold the reasoning of the New York Court
of Appeals.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .The regulation in _Loretto_ seems to impose minimal harm
on owners of residential rental property—indeed it probably increased the value
of that

property by making it more attractive to tenants. (On
remand, the New York courts concluded that Ms. Loretto was entitled to only $ 1
in nominal

compensation. Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.,
446 N.E. 2 d 428 (N.Y. 1983 ).) Yet from the perspective of an
anti-circumvention theory

of regulatory takings, this was an easy case for finding a
taking. All kinds of public utility companies—electric distribution companies,
telephone

companies, natural gas distribution companies—need to
acquire easements to lay down their distribution lines. The established method
of acquiring

such easements, when voluntary negotiations to secure an
easement break down, is to use a delegated power of eminent domain. Thus, when
a new type

of distribution company comes along—cable television—it
seems only natural that these newcomers should also use voluntary negotiation
or eminent

domain to acquire easements to run their wires from building
to building. A holding contrary to the one reached by the Court, suggesting
that easements

acquired by some utilities that impose only minor costs on
servient landowners can proceed by police power regulation rather than

```



1258



```

eminent domain, would have opened a big can of worms in an
area of the law that had previously been regarded as settled. Why do you
suppose the

Court ignored this line of analysis and created a new per se
rule for permanent physical occupations?

2 .In terms of doctrinal development, _Loretto_ was
significant far beyond its holding. As suggested by footnote 12 in the Court’s
opinion, the

combination of _Penn Central_ and _Loretto_ suggests that
regulatory takings doctrine partakes of a general “ad hoc” test, supplemented
by rules of “per se”

liability that apply in particular circumstances. This is
similar to the approach of antitrust law, which follows a general “rule of
reason” in determining

whether particular restraints on trade violate the law,
supplemented by “per se” rules that apply to conduct that seems to warrant
liability without regard

to the circumstances. See, e.g., Broadcast Music, Inc. v.
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1 ( 1979 ). This two-tiered
structure of decisional

rules was to blossom into a more complete form in _Lucas_ ,
a case appearing later in the chapter. For overviews of the relationship
between categorical

and ad hoc takings tests, see Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc.,
544 U.S. 528 , 538 – 40 ( 2005 ); David A. Dana & Thomas W. Merrill,
Property: Takings 86 –

168 ( 2002 ).

3 .Is the contrast between Justice Marshall’s opinion in
_Loretto_ and Justice Brennan’s opinion in _Penn Central_ another example of
the divide in

property law between theories of property that stress the
centrality of exclusion rights, and those that characterize property as a
bundle of rights? Is

_Loretto_ just a reflexive transposition of a private law
rule into a public law context, where it makes little sense? Or is it possible
to justify the Court’s

rule by drawing upon some of the same reasons that justify
liability without proof of harm for trespasses to land in the private law
context?

4 .The right to exclude, which is given such prominence in
_Loretto_ , also played a role in other takings controversies decided around
the same time,

with mixed results. In _Kaiser Aetna v. United States_ , 444
U.S. 164 ( 1979 ), the Court considered whether a federal directive to open a
privately-

constructed marina to the general public as part of the
navigable waters of the United States was a taking. Distinguishing cases
holding that regulations

designed to preserve the public “navigation servitude” are
not takings and stressing the importance of the right to exclude others in
preserving

investment-backed expectations, the Court found that the
regulation was a taking. In _PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins_ , 447 U.S. 74
( 1980 ), in

contrast, the Court held that a state directive allowing
persons to distribute political leaflets and information in a privately-owned
shopping center was

not a taking. The Court acknowledged the importance of the
right to exclude, but noted that the shopping center had opened its doors to
the general

public (for shopping purposes), and concluded that the
regulation had only a minor impact on any investment-backed expectations. Both
decisions

applied _Penn Central_ ’s ad hoc test and did not suggest
any per se rule for permanent invasions or occupations.

Post- Loretto Developments Regarding Physical Invasions

After Loretto , the new per se rule for permanent physical
occupations received a choppy reception. Initially, the Court interpreted the
rule

narrowly. In Yee v. City of Escondido , 503 U.S. 519 (1992),
the Court held that an ordinance that took away a landlord’s right to determine
the

identity of a replacement tenant in a mobile home park did
not result in a permanent occupation, because the landlord had voluntarily
chosen to

lease the property in the first place. Similarly, in FCC v.
Florida Power Corp. , 480 U.S. 245 (1987), the Court rejected the claim that a
federal

directive requiring utility companies to lease space on
poles to cable companies at regulated rates was a permanent occupation, because
the

original lease arrangement had been voluntary.

The tide arguably turned when the Court began considering
exactions imposed as a condition of developing property (considered more fully

below). See Nollan v. California Coastal Comm., 483 U.S. 825
(1987); Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994). In both decisions, the
Court

indicated that regulations requiring property owners to
dedicate a permanent easement of public access would be per se takings under
Loretto.

See Nollan, 483 U.S. at 832 (“We think a ‘permanent physical
occupation’ has occurred... where individuals are given a permanent and

continuous right to pass to and fro, so that the real
property may continuously be traversed, even though no particular individual is
permitted to

station himself permanently on the premises.”) This
seemingly expanded the per se rule of Loretto to include permanent rights of
access. This, of

course, is characteristic of easements more generally: one
can have an easement granting a permanent right of access to land even if one
never

uses it, and hence never occupies the land, even
temporarily.

A major expansion of Loretto occurred in Horne v. Department
of Agriculture , 576 U.S. 350 (2015), where the Court held that the per se

rule for permanent physical occupations of real property
also applies to what it called physical “appropriations” of personal property.
Under New

Deal-era legislation designed to prop up the prices obtained
by producers of agricultural products, farmers who grow grapes for the raisin
market

are required to turn over their crop to government-licensed
handlers. The handlers sell a portion of the crop, called free-tonnage raisins,
on the

open market, and give the proceeds to the producer; but the
handlers hold back another portion of the crop, called reserve raisins, and
dispose of

them in ways that will not augment the supply of raisins in
the domestic commercial market (e.g., they are sold in the foreign market). The

obvious purpose of the program is to restrict the supply of
raisins in the domestic market, and thereby increase the price of raisins
obtained by

producers.

In a suit by a producer claiming that the mandatory
diversion of a portion of the crop as reserve raisins was a taking of property,
the Court

agreed. No one questioned that the Takings Clause applies to
personal

#1260

property as well as real property. The question was whether
a physical appropriation of personal property by the government, analogous to a

conversion, should be governed by a per se rule or the ad
hoc approach of Penn Central. The majority opinion, by Chief Justice Roberts,
held

that the question was controlled by Loretto (576 U.S. at
361–62):

The reserve requirement imposed by the Raisin Committee is a
clear physical taking. Actual raisins are transferred from the growers to

the Government. Title to the raisins passes to the Raisin
Committee. The Committee’s raisins must be physically segregated from free-

tonnage raisins. Reserve raisins are sometimes left on the
premises of handlers, but they are held “for the account” of the Government.

The Committee disposes of what become its raisins as it
wishes, to promote the purposes of the raisin marketing order.

Raisin growers subject to the reserve requirement thus lose
the entire “bundle” of property rights in the appropriated raisins—“the

rights to possess, use and dispose of” them, Loretto, 458
U.S., at 435 (internal quotation marks omitted) * * *. The Government’s

“actual taking of possession and control” of the reserve
raisins gives rise to a taking as clearly “as if the Government held full title
and

ownership,” id., at 431 (internal quotation marks omitted),
as it essentially does. The Government’s formal demand that the Hornes

turn over a percentage of their raisin crop without charge,
for the Government’s control and use, is “of such a unique character that it is

a taking without regard to other factors that a court might
ordinarily examine.” Id., at 432 (citations omitted).

The Chief Justice conceded that if the government had
proceeded differently, by restricting the quantity of raisins that producers
could sell,

this would have to be assessed under Penn Central ’s ad hoc
test. And he acknowledged that the economic impact on producers would be the

same, whether the government restricted the sale of raisins
or required that a portion of the crop be turned over to handlers for disposal
outside

the commercial market. But the functional equivalence
between the two approaches ignored “the settled difference in our takings
jurisprudence

between appropriation and regulation. A physical taking of
raisins and a regulatory limit on production may have the same economic impact
on a

grower. The Constitution, however, is concerned with means
as well as ends.” 576 U.S. at 362.

The principal dissent, by Justice Breyer, argued that even
if the reserve raisin requirement could be characterized as a taking of
personal

property, the case should be remanded for a determination of
the amount of compensation the Hornes were entitled to receive, applying the
rule

of offsetting benefits applied in cases of partial takings.
(See Note on Partial Takings after United States v. Miller , supra.) He
appeared to agree

with the government that the benefit to producers like the
Hornes from higher

#1261

prices on free tonnage raisins quite likely equaled or
exceeded the revenue they lost from not being able to sell the reserve raisins
on the open

market. The Chief Justice rejected the idea of a remand to
determine the proper compensation, commenting that “this case, in litigation
for more

than a decade, has gone on long enough.” 576 U.S. at 370.

### 4 .EXACTIONS

One of the features of modern zoning and land-use planning
is that developers must submit their plans for new subdivisions, shopping

centers, and other significant real estate developments to
local planning authorities for their approval before construction may begin.
Under the

original conception of zoning, the purpose of requiring
advance approval was to ensure that the proposed development was consistent
with the

local zoning ordinance. As we saw in Chapter IX, in recent
decades the approval process has evolved into complex negotiations between

developers and local authorities over the scope, uses, and
density of the proposed project. These negotiations often include what are
called

exactions—an agreement by the developer to donate certain
property or money to the local community—as a condition of obtaining approval

from authorities to proceed with the development. The
justification for these exactions is that they provide resources that the
community can use

for public goods like new parks or schools that offset, at
least in part, the burdens imposed on the community by the new development. See

generally Alan A. Altshuler et & José A. Gómez-Ibáñez,
Regulation for Revenue: The Political Economy of Land Use Exactions (1993).

State courts have reviewed challenges to exactions for many
years, typically under state constitutional doctrines like substantive due

process. In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court took up the issue
under the Takings Clause, in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm’n , 483 U.S. 825

(1987). The Nollans owned a dilapidated beachfront bungalow,
which they wanted to replace with a larger house. The California Coastal

Commission informed them that permission to undertake the
development would not be granted unless they agreed to convey a lateral
easement

of public access along the beach behind their house. In a
5–4 decision authored by Justice Scalia, the Court declared that this exaction
violated

the Takings Clause. The Court assumed that the Commission
could have denied the building permit outright, in the interest of ensuring
“visual

access” to the ocean and preventing overcrowding of beaches.
But it found no nexus between these asserted public justifications and the

condition the Commission wanted to impose—a lateral easement
facilitating the movement of the public up and down the beach. The Court

suggested that “unless the permit condition serves the same
governmental purpose as the development ban, the building restriction is not a
valid

regulation of land but ‘an out-and-out plan of extortion.’ ”
Id. at 837 (citation omitted).

#1262

Nollan was a confusing decision because it was unclear
whether the Court was advancing a general requirement that all property
regulations

satisfy some level of means-ends rationality, or whether it
was asserting a rule unique to exactions. The following decision restated the
Nollan

holding and provided a clearer exposition of why exactions
are a matter of heighten concern under the Takings Clause.

#### Dolan v. City of Tigard

```



Supreme Court of the United States, 1994.



512 U.S. 374.



```

■ CHIEF
JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court. Petitioner challenges the
decision of the Oregon Supreme Court which held that

the city of Tigard could condition the approval of her
building permit on the dedication of a portion of her property for flood
control and traffic

improvements. We granted certiorari to resolve a question
left open by our decision in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm’n, 483 U.S. 825

(1987), of what is the required degree of connection between
the exactions imposed by the city and the projected impacts of the proposed

development.

I

[The City of Tigard, Oregon, a suburb of Portland, adopted
land use plans that were designed to reduce congestion in the central business

district and limit flood damage that periodically occurred
along the Fanno Creek. Petitioner Florence Dolan owned a plumbing and electric

supply store that abutted Fanno Creek. When she sought a
permit to double the size of her store and pave over the parking lot, the City
Planning

Commission indicated that it would grant the permit only if
she agreed to dedicate a portion of her property in the 100-year floodplain of
the

creek as a “greenway,” and further dedicate a 15-foot strip
of land adjacent to the floodplain as a bicycle/pedestrian pathway. Dolan
challenged

the required dedications—which constituted roughly 10% of
per property—as an unconstitutional taking. Oregon courts rejected the claim,
and

the Supreme Court granted certiorari.]

II

* * * Without question, had the city simply required
      petitioner to dedicate a strip of land along Fanno Creek for public use, rather
      than

conditioning the grant of her permit to redevelop her
property on such a dedication, a taking would have occurred. Nollan, supra, 483
U.S., at

831. Such public access would deprive petitioner of the
     right to exclude others, “one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of
     rights that are

commonly characterized as property.” Kaiser Aetna v. United
States, 444 U.S. 164, 176 (1979).

On the other side of the ledger, the authority of state and
local governments to engage in land use planning has been sustained against

constitutional challenge as long ago as our decision in
Village of Euclid

#1263

v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365, (1926). “Government
hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be

diminished without paying for every such change in the
general law.” Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 413 (1922). * * *

Under the well-settled doctrine of “unconstitutional
conditions,” the government may not require a person to give up a
constitutional right—

here the right to receive just compensation when property is
taken for a public use—in exchange for a discretionary benefit conferred by the

government where the benefit sought has little or no
relationship to the property. See Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593 (1972);
Pickering v.

Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,
391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968).

Petitioner contends that the city has forced her to choose
between the building permit and her right under the Fifth Amendment to just

compensation for the public easements. Petitioner does not
quarrel with the city’s authority to exact some forms of dedication as a
condition for

the grant of a building permit, but challenges the showing
made by the city to justify these exactions. She argues that the city has
identified “no

special benefits” conferred on her, and has not identified
any “special quantifiable burdens” created by her new store that would justify
the

particular dedications required from her which are not
required from the public at large.

III

In evaluating petitioner’s claim, we must first determine
whether the “essential nexus” exists between the “legitimate state interest”
and the

permit condition exacted by the city. Nollan, 483 U.S., at
837. If we find that a nexus exists, we must then decide the required degree of

connection between the exactions and the projected impact of
the proposed development. We were not required to reach this question in
Nollan,

because we concluded that the connection did not meet even
the loosest standard. Id., at 838. Here, however, we must decide this question.

A

We addressed the essential nexus question in Nollan. The
California Coastal Commission demanded a lateral public easement across the

Nollans’ beachfront lot in exchange for a permit to demolish
an existing bungalow and replace it with a three-bedroom house. Id., at 828.
The

public easement was designed to connect two public beaches
that were separated by the Nollan’s property. The Coastal Commission had
asserted

that the public easement condition was imposed to promote
the legitimate state interest of diminishing the “blockage of the view of the
ocean”

caused by construction of the larger house.

We agreed that the Coastal Commission’s concern with
protecting visual access to the ocean constituted a legitimate public interest.
Id., at

835. We also agreed that the permit condition would have
     been

#1264

constitutional “even if it consisted of the requirement that
the Nollans provide a viewing spot on their property for passersby with whose
sighting

of the ocean their new house would interfere.” Id., at 836.
We resolved, however, that the Coastal Commission’s regulatory authority was
set

completely adrift from its constitutional moorings when it
claimed that a nexus existed between visual access to the ocean and a permit
condition

requiring lateral public access along the Nollans’
beachfront lot. Id., at 837. How enhancing the public’s ability to “traverse to
and along the

shorefront” served the same governmental purpose of “visual
access to the ocean” from the roadway was beyond our ability to countenance.
The

absence of a nexus left the Coastal Commission in the
position of simply trying to obtain an easement through gimmickry, which
converted a

valid regulation of land use into “ ‘an out-and-out plan of
extortion.’ ” Ibid., quoting J.E.D. Associates, Inc. v. Atkinson, 121 N.H. 581,
584, 432

A.2d 12, 14–15 (1981).

No such gimmicks are associated with the permit conditions
imposed by the city in this case. Undoubtedly, the prevention of flooding along

Fanno Creek and the reduction of traffic congestion in the
Central Business District qualify as the type of legitimate public purposes we
have

upheld. It seems equally obvious that a nexus exists between
preventing flooding along Fanno Creek and limiting development within the
creek’s

100–year floodplain. Petitioner proposes to double the size
of her retail store and to pave her now-gravel parking lot, thereby expanding
the

impervious surface on the property and increasing the amount
of storm water runoff into Fanno Creek.

The same may be said for the city’s attempt to reduce
traffic congestion by providing for alternative means of transportation. In
theory, a

pedestrian/bicycle pathway provides a useful alternative
means of transportation for workers and shoppers: “Pedestrians and bicyclists
occupying

dedicated spaces for walking and/or bicycling... remove
potential vehicles from streets, resulting in an overall improvement in total

transportation system flow” [citation omitted]. * * *

B

The second part of our analysis requires us to determine
whether the degree of the exactions demanded by the city’s permit conditions
bears

the required relationship to the projected impact of
petitioner’s proposed development. * * *

Since state courts have been dealing with this question a
good deal longer than we have, we turn to representative decisions made by
them.

In some States, very generalized statements as to the
necessary connection between the required dedication and the proposed
development

seem to suffice. See, e.g., Billings Properties, Inc. v.
Yellowstone County, 144 Mont. 25, 394 P.2d 182 (1964); Jenad, Inc. v.
Scarsdale, 218

N.E.2d 673 (N.Y. 1966). We think this standard is too lax

#1265

to adequately protect petitioner’s right to just
compensation if her property is taken for a public purpose.

Other state courts require a very exacting correspondence,
described as the “specifi[c] and uniquely attributable” test. The Supreme Court
of

Illinois first developed this test in Pioneer Trust &
Savings Bank v. Mount Prospect, 176 N.E.2d 799, 802 (Ill. 1961). Under this
standard, if the

local government cannot demonstrate that its exaction is
directly proportional to the specifically created need, the exaction becomes “a
veiled

exercise of the power of eminent domain and a confiscation
of private property behind the defense of police regulations.” Id., at 802. We
do not

think the Federal Constitution requires such exacting
scrutiny, given the nature of the interests involved.

A number of state courts have taken an intermediate
position, requiring the municipality to show a “reasonable relationship”
between the

required dedication and the impact of the proposed
development. Typical is the Supreme Court of Nebraska’s opinion in Simpson v.
North Platte,

292 N.W.2d 297, 301 (Neb. 1980) * * * Some form of the
reasonable relationship test has been adopted in many other jurisdictions.
[Citations

omitted.] * * *

We think the “reasonable relationship” test adopted by a
majority of the state courts is closer to the federal constitutional norm than
either of

those previously discussed. But we do not adopt it as such,
partly because the term “reasonable relationship” seems confusingly similar to
the

term “rational basis” which describes the minimal level of
scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We
think a

term such as “rough proportionality” best encapsulates what
we hold to be the requirement of the Fifth Amendment. No precise mathematical

calculation is required, but the city must make some sort of
individualized determination that the required dedication is related both in
nature and

extent to the impact of the proposed development. * * *

JUSTICE STEVENS’ dissent [argues] that the city’s
conditional demands for part of petitioner’s property are “a species of
business regulation

that heretofore warranted a strong presumption of
constitutional validity.” But simply denominating a governmental measure as a
“business

regulation” does not immunize it from constitutional
challenge on the ground that it violates a provision of the Bill of Rights. * *

* We see no

reason why the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as
much a part of the Bill of Rights as the First Amendment or Fourth Amendment,

should be relegated to the status of a poor relation in
these comparable circumstances. We turn now to analysis of whether the findings
relied

upon by the city here, first with respect to the floodplain
easement, and second with respect to the pedestrian/bicycle path, satisfied
these

requirements.

It is axiomatic that increasing the amount of impervious
surface will increase the quantity and rate of storm water flow from
petitioner’s

property. Therefore, keeping the floodplain open and free
from

#1266

development would likely confine the pressures on Fanno
Creek created by petitioner’s development. In fact, because petitioner’s
property lies

within the Central Business District, the CDC already
required that petitioner leave 15% of it as open space and the undeveloped
floodplain

would have nearly satisfied that requirement. But the city
demanded more—it not only wanted petitioner not to build in the floodplain, but
it also

wanted petitioner’s property along Fanno Creek for its
greenway system. The city has never said why a public greenway, as opposed to a
private

one, was required in the interest of flood control.

The difference to petitioner, of course, is the loss of her
ability to exclude others. As we have noted, this right to exclude others is
“one of

the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are
commonly characterized as property.” Kaiser Aetna, 444 U.S., at 176. It is
difficult to see

why recreational visitors trampling along petitioner’s
floodplain easement are sufficiently related to the city’s legitimate interest
in reducing

flooding problems along Fanno Creek, and the city has not
attempted to make any individualized determination to support this part of its
request.

---

With respect to the pedestrian/bicycle pathway, we have no
doubt that the city was correct in finding that the larger retail sales
facility

proposed by petitioner will increase traffic on the streets
of the Central Business District. The city estimates that the proposed
development

would generate roughly 435 additional trips per day.
Dedications for streets, sidewalks, and other public ways are generally
reasonable exactions

to avoid excessive congestion from a proposed property use.
But on the record before us, the city has not met its burden of demonstrating
that the

additional number of vehicle and bicycle trips generated by
petitioner’s development reasonably relate to the city’s requirement for a
dedication

of the pedestrian/bicycle pathway easement. The city simply
found that the creation of the pathway “could offset some of the traffic
demand...

and lessen the increase in traffic congestion.” * * *

No precise mathematical calculation is required, but the
city must make some effort to quantify its findings in support of the
dedication for

the pedestrian/bicycle pathway beyond the conclusory
statement that it could offset some of the traffic demand generated.

IV

Cities have long engaged in the commendable task of land use
planning, made necessary by increasing urbanization, particularly in

metropolitan areas such as Portland. The city’s goals of
reducing flooding hazards and traffic congestion, and providing for public
greenways, are

laudable, but there are outer limits to how this may be
done. “A strong public desire to improve the public condition [will not]
warrant achieving

the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of
paying for the change.” Pennsylvania Coal, 260 U.S., at 416.

#1267

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Oregon is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this

opinion.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .For general commentary on the unconstitutional conditions
doctrine, see Vicki Been, “Exit” as a Constraint on Land Use Exactions:
Rethinking

the Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine, 91 Colum. L. Rev.
473 ( 1991 ); Mitchell N. Berman, Coercion Without Baselines: Conditions in
Three

Dimensions, 90 Geo. L.J. 1 , 36 – 40 ( 2001 ); Kathleen M.
Sullivan, Unconstitutional Conditions, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1413 ( 1989 ). The
doctrine has been

applied with the most rigor in the First Amendment context.
With respect to other constitutional rights, such as the right to trial by jury
in criminal cases,

the right is enforced only to the extent that courts seek to
assure that waivers are “knowing and intelligent.” Was the Court justified in
extending a

moderately robust version of the doctrine to the Takings
Clause? Property is bought and sold all the time. Why not let owners in effect
“sell” some

property to the government in return for a benefit they
value more, such as a permit to develop the property they retain? See Douglas
T. Kendall &

James E. Ryan, “Paying” for the Change: Using Eminent Domain
to Secure Exactions and Sidestep _Nollan_ and _Dolan_ , 81 Va. L. Rev. 1801 (
1995 ).

2 .In requiring that the exaction be “roughly proportionate”
to the impact of the development, has the Court mandated the correct comparison
in

terms of what must be proportionate to what? The Court
appears to understand that the value of the exaction must be proportionate to
the social costs of

the proposed development. In effect, the exaction is viewed
as a kind of charge designed to make the owner internalize (as least partially)
the social

costs of the development. From a social efficiency
standpoint, would it be better to compare the value of the demanded exaction in
the hands of the

private owner (more development or perhaps more owner
autonomy) with its value in the hands of the community (more lateral beach
easements,

bicycle paths, wetlands, or other public goods)? One reason
for requiring the government to pay just compensation when it takes property is
to induce

the government to make these kinds of value comparisons,
taking property only when the public willingness to pay exceeds the fair market
value of the

property in private ownership. Should the exactions calculus
try to mimic the same relevant comparison?

3 .In _Kelo v. City of New London_ , supra, the Court
observes that the states have adopted different approaches to the “public use”
question and

concludes that the federal constitutional standard should be
a deferential one in order to permit the states to adopt different approaches
to how the power

of eminent domain is used. In _Dolan_ , the Court also
observes that the states have adopted different approaches to the degree of
nexus required

```

```

between exactions of property and the effects of a proposed
development. But now, the Court takes this variation among the states as a kind
of menu of

options from which to select a federal constitutional
standard, which will then be imposed as a minimal requirement on all other
states. Is there a

justification for this difference in the assumed
relationship between federal and state law with respect to these two questions
about local land-use issues?

Or should the Court have consistently opted in both contexts
either for state variation or for minimum federal standards?

The Koontz Decision

The Court’s most recent decision dealing with exactions is
Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District , 570 U.S. 595 (2013). All

Justices in the case appeared to accept the unconstitutional
conditions framework established by Nollan and Dolan , and along with that

framework the requirements that the exaction satisfy the
“nexus” and “rough proportionality” tests. The most seriously contested issue
was

whether these limits apply when the exaction imposed by the
government takes the form of a payment of cash as opposed to land or an
easement.

In Koontz , the government demanded the money in order to
mitigate the effects of the proposed development on wetlands; it said the money

would be used to enhance some wetlands on government-owned
land elsewhere. Ruling in a 5–4 decision, the majority, speaking through
Justice

Alito, held that a demand for money to pay for such a
mitigation effort is also subject to the tests of Nollan and Dolan. Justice
Alito reaffirmed

that taxes are not subject to challenge under the Takings
Clause. Id. at 615. But he insisted that a monetary exaction is not a tax,
because the

exaction operates on “an identified property interest.” Id.
at 613, quoting Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498, 540 (1998)
(Kennedy, J.,

concurring). More practically, he argued that if exactions
of money were not covered by Nollan and Dolan , land use authorities could
readily

evade the requirements of those decisions by requiring the
payment of cash, either as an alternative to demanding land or an easement or
as a

source of funds to acquire the desired resources.

Justice Kagan, writing for the four dissenters, acknowledged
that prior decisions of the Court had held that taking a specific fund of money

can be a taking. See Brown v. Legal Foundation of
Washington, 538 U.S. 216 (2003) (taking by government of interest earned on
client funds

deposited with attorneys); Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc.
v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155 (1980) (taking by government of interest earned on

funds deposited in court in an interpleader action). But
five Justices in Eastern Enterprises had concluded that the imposition of a
general

liability cannot be regarded as a taking. And in Koontz ,
the requirement to pay, although triggered by a request to develop a particular
parcel of

land, could be paid from any source—“a checking account,
shares of stock, a wealthy uncle.” Koontz , at 625. If a general liability does
not create

a per se taking, she argued, then it is hard to see how the
unconstitutional conditions framework adopted in Dolan applies. Justice Kagan
also

#1269

complained that the majority had provided inadequate
guidance for distinguishing monetary exactions from either taxes or development
fees, and

that this would be a source of significant confusion on the
part of land use agencies and lower courts going forward.

### 5 .ACCESS RIGHTS

#### Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid

```



Supreme Court of the United States, 2021.



141 S.Ct 2063.



```

■ CHIEF
JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court. A California regulation
grants labor organizations a “right to take access” to an

agricultural employer’s property in order to solicit support
for unionization. Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, § 20900(e)(1)(C) (2020).
Agricultural

employers must allow union organizers onto their property
for up to three hours per day, 120 days per year. The question presented is
whether the

access regulation constitutes a per se physical taking under
the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.

I

The California Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975
gives agricultural employees a right to self-organization and makes it an
unfair

labor practice for employers to interfere with that right.
Cal. Lab. Code Ann. §§ 1 152, 1 153(a) (West 2020). The state Agricultural
Labor

Relations Board has promulgated a regulation providing, in
its current form, that the self-organization rights of employees include “the
right of

access by union organizers to the premises of an
agricultural employer for the purpose of meeting and talking with employees and
soliciting their

support.” Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, § 20900(e). Under the
regulation, a labor organization may “take access” to an agricultural
employer’s property

for up to four 30-day periods in one calendar year. §§ 209
00(e)(1)(A), (B). In order to take access, a labor organization must file a
written notice

with the Board and serve a copy on the employer. § 2
0900(e)(1)(B). Two organizers per work crew (plus one additional organizer for
every 15

workers over 30 workers in a crew) may enter the employer’s
property for up to one hour before work, one hour during the lunch break, and
one

hour after work. §§ 20 900(e)(3)(A)–(B), (4)(A). Organizers
may not engage in disruptive conduct, but are otherwise free to meet and talk
with

employees as they wish. §§ 20900(e)(3)(A), (4)(C).
Interference with organizers’ right of access may constitute an unfair labor
practice,

§ 2 0900(e)(5)(C), which can result in sanctions against the
employer, see, e.g., Harry Carian Sales v. Agricultural Labor Relations Bd.,
703 P.2d

27, 42 (Cal. 1985).

Cedar Point Nursery is a strawberry grower in northern
California. It employs over 400 seasonal workers and around 100 full-time
workers,

none of whom live on the property. According to the
complaint, in October

#1270

2015, at five o’clock one morning, members of the United
Farm Workers entered Cedar Point’s property without prior notice. The
organizers

moved to the nursery’s trim shed, where hundreds of workers
were preparing strawberry plants. Calling through bullhorns, the organizers

disturbed operations, causing some workers to join the
organizers in a protest and others to leave the worksite altogether. Cedar
Point filed a

charge against the union for taking access without giving
notice. The union responded with a charge of its own, alleging that Cedar Point
had

committed an unfair labor practice.

Fowler Packing Company is a Fresno-based grower and shipper
of table grapes and citrus. It has 1,800 to 2,500 employees in its field

operations and around 500 in its packing facility. As with
Cedar Point, none of Fowler’s workers live on the premises. In July 2015,
organizers

from the United Farm Workers attempted to take access to
Fowler’s property, but the company blocked them from entering. The union filed
an

unfair labor practice charge against Fowler, which it later
withdrew.

Believing that the union would likely attempt to enter their
property again in the near future, the growers filed suit in Federal District
Court

against several Board members in their official capacity.
The growers argued that the access regulation effected an unconstitutional per
se

physical taking under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments by
appropriating without compensation an easement for union organizers to enter

their property. They requested declaratory and injunctive
relief prohibiting the Board from enforcing the regulation against them.

The District Court denied the growers’ motion for a
preliminary injunction and granted the Board’s motion to dismiss. The court
rejected

the growers’ argument that the access regulation constituted
a per se physical taking, reasoning that it did not “allow the public to access
their

property in a permanent and continuous manner for whatever
reason.” In the court’s view, the regulation was instead subject to evaluation
under

the multifactor balancing test of Penn Central
Transportation Co. v. New York City , 438 U.S. 104 (1978), which the growers
had made no

attempt to satisfy.

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit affirmed. * * *

The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc. Judge Ikuta
dissented, joined by seven other judges. She reasoned that the access
regulation

appropriated from the growers a traditional form of private
property—an easement in gross—and transferred that property to union
organizers.

The appropriation of such an easement, she concluded,
constituted a per se physical taking under the precedents of this Court.

We granted certiorari.

#1271

II

A

* * * When the government physically acquires private
      property for a public use, the Takings Clause imposes a clear and categorical

obligation to provide the owner with just compensation.
Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535
U.S.

302, 321 (2002). The Court’s physical takings jurisprudence
is “as old as the Republic.” Id. , at 322. The government commits a physical
taking

when it uses its power of eminent domain to formally condemn
property. See United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 374–375

(1945); United States ex rel. TVA v. Powelson, 319 U.S. 266,
270–271 (1943). The same is true when the government physically takes

possession of property without acquiring title to it. See
United States v. Pewee Coal Co., 341 U.S. 11 4, 1 15–1 17 (1951) (plurality
opinion). And

the government likewise effects a physical taking when it
occupies property—say, by recurring flooding as a result of building a dam. See
United

States v. Cress, 243 U.S. 316, 327–328 (1917). These sorts
of physical appropriations constitute the “clearest sort of taking,” Palazzolo
v. Rhode

Island, 533 U.S. 606, 617 (2001), and we assess them using a
simple, per se rule: The government must pay for what it takes. See
Tahoe-Sierra,

535 U.S. at 322.

When the government, rather than appropriating private
property for itself or a third party, instead imposes regulations that restrict
an

owner’s ability to use his own property, a different
standard applies. Id. , at 321–322. Our jurisprudence governing such use
restrictions has

developed more recently. Before the 20th century, the
Takings Clause was understood to be limited to physical appropriations of
property. See

Horne v. Department of Agriculture, 576 U. S. 350, 360
(2015); Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457, 551 (1871). In Pennsylvania Coal Co.
v.

Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922), however, the Court established
the proposition that “while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if

regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.”
Id. , at 415. This framework now applies to use restrictions as varied as
zoning

ordinances, Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co. , 272
U.S. 365, 387–38 8 (1926), orders barring the mining of gold, United States v.
Central

Eureka Mining Co. , 357 U.S. 155, 168 (1958), and
regulations prohibiting the sale of eagle feathers, Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S.
51, 65–66

(1979). To determine whether a use restriction effects a
taking, this Court has generally applied the flexible test developed in Penn
Central ,

balancing factors such as the economic impact of the
regulation, its interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations,
and the

character of the government action. 438 U.S. at 124.

Our cases have often described use restrictions that go “too
far” as “regulatory takings.” See, e.g., Horne, 576 U.S. at 360; Yee v.

Escondido, 503 U.S. 519, 527 (1992). But that label can
mislead. Government action that physically appropriates property is no less a
physical

taking because

#1272

it arises from a regulation. That explains why we held that
an administrative reserve requirement compelling raisin growers to physically
set

aside a percentage of their crop for the government
constituted a physical rather than a regulatory taking. Horne, 576 U.S. at 361.
The essential

question is not, as the Ninth Circuit seemed to think,
whether the government action at issue comes garbed as a regulation (or
statute, or

ordinance, or miscellaneous decree). It is whether the
government has physically taken property for itself or someone else—by whatever
means

—or has instead restricted a property owner’s ability to use
his own property. See Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U.S. at 321–323. Whenever a regulation

results in a physical appropriation of property, a per se
taking has occurred, and Penn Central has no place.

B

The access regulation appropriates a right to invade the
growers’ property and therefore constitutes a per se physical taking. The
regulation

grants union organizers a right to physically enter and
occupy the growers’ land for three hours per day, 120 days per year. Rather
than

restraining the growers’ use of their own property, the
regulation appropriates for the enjoyment of third parties the owners’ right to
exclude.

The right to exclude is “one of the most treasured” rights
of property ownership. Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S.

419, 435 (1982). According to Blackstone, the very idea of
property entails “that sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and

exercises over the external things of the world, in total
exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe.” 2 W.
Blackstone,

Commentaries on the Laws of England 2 (1766). In less
exuberant terms, we have stated that the right to exclude is “universally held
to be a

fundamental element of the property right,” and is “one of
the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly
characterized as

property.” Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164, 1
76, 179–180 (1979); see Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, 384, 393 (1994);
Nollan

v. California Coastal Comm’n, 483 U.S. 825 , 831 (1987); see
also Merrill, Property and the Right to Exclude, 77 Neb. L. Rev. 730 (1998)

(calling the right to exclude the “ sine qua non ” of
property).

Given the central importance to property ownership of the
right to exclude, it comes as little surprise that the Court has long treated

government-authorized physical invasions as takings
requiring just compensation. The Court has often described the property
interest taken as a

servitude or an easement.

For example, in United States v. Causby we held that the
invasion of private property by overflights effected a taking. 328 U.S. 256
(1946).

The government frequently flew military aircraft low over
the Causby farm, grazing the treetops and terrorizing the poultry. Id., at 259.
The

Court observed that ownership of the land extended to
airspace that low, and that “invasions of it are in the same category as
invasions of the

surface.”

#1273

Id., at 265. Because the damages suffered by the Causbys
“were the product of a direct invasion of [their] domain,” we held that “a
servitude has

been imposed upon the land.” Id., at 265–266, 267; see also
Portsmouth Harbor Land & Hotel Co. v. United States, 260 U.S. 327, 330
(1922)

(government assertion of a right to fire coastal defense
guns across private property would constitute a taking). * * *

In Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp. , we made
clear that a permanent physical occupation constitutes a per se taking

regardless whether it results in only a trivial economic
loss. * * *

We reiterated that the appropriation of an easement
constitutes a physical taking in Nollan v. California Coastal Commission. * * *

More recently, in Horne v. Department of Agriculture , we
observed that “people still do not expect their property, real or personal, to
be

actually occupied or taken away.” 576 U.S. at 361. The
physical appropriation by the government of the raisins in that case was a per
se taking,

even if a regulatory limit with the same economic impact
would not have been. Id., at 362. “The Constitution,” we explained, “is
concerned with

means as well as ends.” 576 U.S. at 362.

The upshot of this line of precedent is that
government-authorized invasions of property—whether by plane, boat, cable, or
beachcomber—

are physical takings requiring just compensation. As in
those cases, the government here has appropriated a right of access to the
growers’

property, allowing union organizers to traverse it at will
for three hours a day, 120 days a year. The regulation appropriates a right to
physically

invade the growers’ property—to literally “take access,” as
the regulation provides. It is therefore a per se physical taking under our
precedents.

Accordingly, the growers’ complaint states a claim for an
uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.

C

The Ninth Circuit saw matters differently, as do the Board
and the dissent. In the decision below, the Ninth Circuit took the view that
the

access regulation did not qualify as a per se taking
because, although it grants a right to physically invade the growers’ property,
it does not allow

for permanent and continuous access “24 hours a day, 365
days a year.” 923 F.3d at 532 (citing Nollan , 483 U.S. at 832). * * *

To begin with, we have held that a physical appropriation is
a taking whether it is permanent or temporary. Our cases establish that

“compensation is mandated when a leasehold is taken and the
government occupies property for its own purposes, even though that use is

temporary.” Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U.S. at 322 (citing General
Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373; United States v. Petty Motor Co., 327 U.S. 372
(1946)).

The duration of an appropriation—just like the size of an
appropriation, see Loretto, 458 U.S. at 4 36–437—bears only on the amount of

compensation. See United States v. Dow, 357 U.S. 17, 26
(1958). For example, after finding a taking by physical invasion, the

#1274

Court in Causby remanded the case to the lower court to
determine “whether the easement taken was temporary or permanent,” in order to
fix the

compensation due. 328 U.S. at 267–268.

To be sure, Loretto emphasized the heightened concerns
associated with “[t]he permanence and absolute exclusivity of a physical

occupation” in contrast to “temporary limitations on the
right to exclude,” and stated that “[n]ot every physical invasion is a taking.”
458 U.S. at

435, n. 12; see also id., at 432–435. The latter point is
well taken, as we will explain. But Nollan clarified that appropriation of a
right to

physically invade property may constitute a taking “even
though no particular individual is permitted to station himself permanently
upon the

premises.” 483 U.S. at 832.

Next, we have recognized that physical invasions constitute
takings even if they are intermittent as opposed to continuous. Causby held
that

overflights of private property effected a taking, even
though they occurred on only 4% of takeoffs and 7% of landings at the nearby
airport. 328

U.S. at 259. And while Nollan happened to involve a legally
continuous right of access, we have no doubt that the Court would have reached
the

same conclusion if the easement demanded by the Commission
had lasted for only 364 days per year. After all, the easement was hardly

continuous as a practical matter. As Justice Brennan
observed in dissent, given the shifting tides, “public passage for a portion of
the year would

either be impossible or would not occur on [the Nollans’]
property.” 483 U.S. at 854. What matters is not that the easement notionally
ran round

the clock, but that the government had taken a right to
physically invade the Nollans’ land. And when the government physically takes
an interest

in property, it must pay for the right to do so. See Horne,
576 U.S. at 357 –358; Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U.S. at 322. The fact that a right to
take access

is exercised only from time to time does not make it any
less a physical taking. * * *

[The Board] takes issue with the growers’ premise that the
access regulation appropriates an easement. In the Board’s estimation, the

regulation does not exact a true easement in gross under
California law because the access right may not be transferred, does not burden
any

particular parcel of property, and may not be recorded.
This, the Board says, reinforces its conclusion that the regulation does not
take a

constitutionally protected property interest from the
growers. The dissent agrees, suggesting that the access right cannot effect a
per se taking

because it does not require the growers to grant the union
organizers an easement as defined by state property law.

These arguments misconstrue our physical takings doctrine.
As a general matter, it is true that the property rights protected by the
Takings

Clause are creatures of state law. See Phillips v.
Washington Legal Foundation, 524 U.S. 156, 164 (1998); Lucas v. South Carolina
Coastal

Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1030 (1992). But no one disputes
that, without the access regulation, the growers would have had the right

#1275

under California law to exclude union organizers from their
property. See Allred v. Harris, 18 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 533 (Cal. Ct. App. 1993).
And no

one disputes that the access regulation took that right from
them. The Board cannot absolve itself of takings liability by appropriating the

growers’ right to exclude in a form that is a slight
mismatch from state easement law. Under the Constitution, property rights
“cannot be so easily

manipulated.” Horne, 576 U.S. at 365 (internal quotation
marks omitted); see also Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S.
155,

164 (1980) (“a State, by ipse dixit , may not transform
private property into public property without compensation”).

Our decisions consistently reflect this intuitive approach.
We have recognized that the government can commit a physical taking either by

appropriating property through a condemnation proceeding or
by simply “enter[ing] into physical possession of property without authority of
a

court order.” Dow, 357 U.S. at 21; see also United States v.
Clarke, 445 U.S. 253, 256–257, and n. 3 (1980). In the latter situation, the

government’s intrusion does not vest it with a property
interest recognized by state law, such as a fee simple or a leasehold. See Dow
, 357 U.S. at

21. Yet we recognize a physical taking all the same. See id.
    , at 22. Any other result would allow the government to appropriate private
    property

without just compensation so long as it avoids formal
condemnation. We have never tolerated that outcome. See Pewee Coal Co., 341
U.S. at

1 16–117. For much the same reason, in Portsmouth , Causby ,
and Loretto we never paused to consider whether the physical invasions at issue

vested the intruders with formal easements according to the
nuances of state property law (nor do we see how they could have). Instead, we

followed our traditional rule: Because the government
appropriated a right to invade, compensation was due. That same test governs
here.

The Board and the dissent further contend that our decision
in PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins , 447 U.S. 74 (1980), establishes that

the access regulation cannot qualify as a per se taking. * *
*

* * * We disagree. Unlike the growers’ properties, the
      PruneYard was open to the public, welcoming some 25,000 patrons a day. 447 U.S.
      at

77–78. Limitations on how a business generally open to the
public may treat individuals on the premises are readily distinguishable from

regulations granting a right to invade property closed to
the public. See Horne , 576 U.S. at 364 (distinguishing PruneYard as involving
“an

already publicly accessible” business); Nollan , 483 U.S. at
832, n. 1 (same).

The Board also relies on our decision in NLRB v. Babcock
& Wilcox Co. , [3 51 U.S. 105 (1956)]. But that reliance is misplaced. In
Babcock ,

the National Labor Relations Board found that several
employers had committed unfair labor practices under the National Labor
Relations Act

by preventing union organizers from distributing literature
on company property. 351 U.S. at 109. We held that the statute did not require

#1276

employers to allow organizers onto their property, at least
outside the unusual circumstance where their employees were otherwise “beyond
the

reach of reasonable union efforts to communicate with them.”
Id., at 1 13; see also [Lechmere, Inc. v. NLRB, 502 U.S. 527, 540 (1992)]

(employees residing off company property are presumptively
not beyond the reach of the union’s message). The Board contends that Babcock
’s

approach of balancing property and organizational rights
should guide our analysis here. See Loretto, 458 U.S. at 434, n. 11 (discussing
Babcock

principle). But Babcock did not involve a takings claim.
Whatever specific takings issues may be presented by the highly contingent
access right

we recognized under the NLRA, California’s access regulation
effects a per se physical taking under our precedents. See Tahoe-Sierra, 535
U.S.

at 322.

D

In its thoughtful opinion, the dissent advances a
distinctive view of property rights. The dissent encourages readers to consider
the issue

“through the lens of ordinary English,” and contends that,
so viewed, the “regulation does not appropriate anything.” Rather, the access

regulation merely “ regulates... the owners’ right to
exclude,” so it must be assessed “under Penn Central ’s fact-intensive test.”
“A right to enter

my woods only on certain occasions,” the dissent elaborates,
“is a taking only if the regulation allowing it goes ‘too far.’ ” The dissent
contends

that our decisions in Causby , Portsmouth , and Kaiser Aetna
applied just such a flexible approach, under which the Court “balanced several

factors” to determine whether the physical invasions at
issue effected a taking. According to the dissent, this kind of latitude toward
temporary

invasions is a practical necessity for governing in our
complex modern world.

With respect, our own understanding of the role of property
rights in our constitutional order is markedly different. In “ordinary English”

“appropriation” means “ taking as one’s own,” 1 Oxford
English Dictionary 587 (2d ed. 1989) (emphasis added), and the regulation
expressly

grants to labor organizers the “right to take access.” We
cannot agree that the right to exclude is an empty formality, subject to
modification at the

government’s pleasure. On the contrary, it is a “fundamental
element of the property right,” Kaiser Aetna, 444 U.S. at 179–180, that cannot
be

balanced away. Our cases establish that appropriations of a
right to invade are per se physical takings, not use restrictions subject to
Penn

Central [.] * * * With regard to the complexities of modern
society, we think they only reinforce the importance of safeguarding the basic

property rights that help preserve individual liberty, as
the Founders explained.

In the end, the dissent’s permissive approach to property
rights hearkens back to views expressed (in dissent) for decades. See, e.g.,
Nollan,

483 U.S. at 864 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (“[The Court’s]
reasoning is hardly suited to the complex reality of natural resource

#1277

protection in the 20th century.”); Loretto, 458 U.S. at 455
(Blackmun, J., dissenting) (“[T]oday’s decision... represents an archaic
judicial

response to a modern social problem.”); Causby, 328 U.S. at
275 (Black, J., dissenting) (“Today’s opinion is, I fear, an opening wedge for
an

unwarranted judicial interference with the power of Congress
to develop solutions for new and vital national problems.”). As for today’s

considered dissent, it concludes with “Better the devil we
know.. .,” but its objections, to borrow from then-Justice Rehnquist’s
invocation of

Wordsworth, “bear[ ] the sound of ‘Old, unhappy, far-off
things, and battles long ago,’ ” Kaiser Aetna, 444 U.S. at 177.

III

The Board, seconded by the dissent, warns that treating the
access regulation as a per se physical taking will endanger a host of state and

federal government activities involving entry onto private
property. That fear is unfounded.

First , our holding does nothing to efface the distinction
between trespass and takings. Isolated physical invasions, not undertaken
pursuant

to a granted right of access, are properly assessed as
individual torts rather than appropriations of a property right. This basic
distinction is firmly

grounded in our precedent. See Portsmouth, 260 U.S. at
329–330 (“[W]hile a single act may not be enough, a continuance of them in
sufficient

number and for a sufficient time may prove [the intent to
take property]. Every successive trespass adds to the force of the evidence.”);
1 P.

Nichols, The Law of Eminent Domain § 112 , p. 311 (1917)
(“[A] mere occasional trespass would not constitute a taking.”). And lower
courts

have had little trouble applying it. See, e.g., Hendler v.
United States, 952 F.2d 1364, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (identifying a “truckdriver
parking on

someone’s vacant land to eat lunch” as an example of a mere
trespass).

The distinction between trespass and takings accounts for
our treatment of temporary government-induced flooding in Arkansas Game and

Fish Commission v. United States , 568 U.S. 23 (2012). There
we held, “simply and only,” that such flooding “gains no automatic exemption
from

Takings Clause inspection.” Id., at 38. Because this type of
flooding can present complex questions of causation, we instructed lower courts

evaluating takings claims based on temporary flooding to
consider a range of factors including the duration of the invasion, the degree
to which it

was intended or foreseeable, and the character of the land
at issue. Id., at 38–39. Applying those factors on remand, the Federal Circuit
concluded

that the government had effected a taking in the form of a
temporary flowage easement. Arkansas Game and Fish Comm’n v. United States, 736

F.3d 1364, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Our approach in Arkansas
Game and Fish Commission reflects nothing more than an application of the

traditional trespass-versus-takings distinction to the
unique considerations that accompany temporary flooding.

#1278

Second , many government-authorized physical invasions will
not amount to takings because they are consistent with longstanding

background restrictions on property rights. As we explained
in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council , the government does not take a

property interest when it merely asserts a “pre-existing
limitation upon the land owner’s title.” 505 U.S. at 1028–1029. For example,
the

government owes a landowner no compensation for requiring
him to abate a nuisance on his property, because he never had a right to engage
in

the nuisance in the first place. See id., at 1029–1030.

These background limitations also encompass traditional
common law privileges to access private property. One such privilege allowed

individuals to enter property in the event of public or
private necessity. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 196 (1964) (entry to
avert an

imminent public disaster); § 197 (entry to avert serious
harm to a person, land, or chattels); cf. Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1029, n. 16. The
common law

also recognized a privilege to enter property to effect an
arrest or enforce the criminal law under certain circumstances. Restatement
(Second) of

Torts §§ 204–205. Because a property owner traditionally had
no right to exclude an official engaged in a reasonable search, see, e.g.,
Sandford

v. Nichols, 13 Mass. 286, 288 (1816), government searches
that are consistent with the Fourth Amendment and state law cannot be said to
take

any property right from landowners. See generally Camara v.
Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco, 387 U.S. 523, 538 (1967).

Third , the government may require property owners to cede a
right of access as a condition of receiving certain benefits, without causing a

taking. In Nollan , we held that “a permit condition that
serves the same legitimate police-power purpose as a refusal to issue the
permit should

not be found to be a taking if the refusal to issue the
permit would not constitute a taking.” 483 U.S. at 836. The inquiry, we later
explained, is

whether the permit condition bears an “essential nexus” and
“rough proportionality” to the impact of the proposed use of the property.
Dolan,

512 U.S. at 386, 391; see also Koontz v. St. Johns River
Water Management Dist., 570 U.S. 595, 599 (2013).

Under this framework, government health and safety
inspection regimes will generally not constitute takings. See, e.g. ,
Ruckelshaus v.

Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1007 (1984). When the government
conditions the grant of a benefit such as a permit, license, or registration on

allowing access for reasonable health and safety
inspections, both the nexus and rough proportionality requirements of the
constitutional

conditions framework should not be difficult to satisfy.
See, e.g., 7 U.S.C. § 136g(a)(1)(A) (pesticide inspections); 16 U.S.C. §
823b(a)

(hydroelectric project investigations); 21 U.S.C. §
374(a)(1) (pharmaceutical inspections); 42 U.S.C. § 2201( o ) (nuclear material
inspections).

None of these considerations undermine our determination
that the access regulation here gives rise to a per se physical taking. Unlike
a

#1279

mere trespass, the regulation grants a formal entitlement to
physically invade the growers’ land. Unlike a law enforcement search, no
traditional

background principle of property law requires the growers to
admit union organizers onto their premises. And unlike standard health and
safety

inspections, the access regulation is not germane to any
benefit provided to agricultural employers or any risk posed to the public. See
Horne,

576 U.S. at 366 (“basic and familiar uses of property” are
not a special benefit that “the Government may hold hostage, to be ransomed by
the

waiver of constitutional protection”). The access regulation
amounts to simple appropriation of private property.

---

The access regulation grants labor organizations a right to
invade the growers’ property. It therefore constitutes a per se physical
taking.

The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings

consistent with this opinion.

■
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, concurring.

I join the Court’s opinion, which carefully adheres to
constitutional text, history, and precedent. I write separately to explain
that, in my

view, the Court’s precedent in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox
Co. , 351 U.S. 105 (1956), also strongly supports today’s decision.

In Babcock , the National Labor Relations Board argued that
the National Labor Relations Act afforded union organizers a right to enter

company property to communicate with employees. Several
employers responded that the Board’s reading of the Act would infringe their
Fifth

Amendment property rights. The employers contended that
Congress, “even if it could constitutionally do so, has at no time shown any
intention

of destroying property rights secured by the Fifth Amendment
, in protecting employees’ rights of collective bargaining under the Act. Until

Congress should evidence such intention by specific
legislative language, our courts should not construe the Act on such dangerous

constitutional grounds.” Brief for Respondent in NLRB v.
Babcock & Wilcox Co., O. T. 1955, No. 250, pp. 18–19.

This Court agreed with the employers’ argument that the Act
should be interpreted to avoid unconstitutionality. The Court reasoned that

“the National Government” via the Constitution “preserves
property rights,” including “the right to exclude from property.” Babcock, 351
U.S. at

1 12. Against the backdrop of the Constitution’s strong
protection of property rights, the Court interpreted the Act to afford access
to union

organizers only when “needed,” ibid.—that is, when the
employees live on company property and union organizers have no other
reasonable

means of communicating with the employees, id., at 113. See
also Lechmere, Inc. v. NLRB, 502 U.S. 527, 540–541 (1992). As I read it,
Babcock

recognized that employers have a basic Fifth Amendment right
to exclude from their

#1280

private property, subject to a “necessity” exception similar
to that noted by the Court today.

Babcock strongly supports the growers’ position in today’s
case because the California union access regulation intrudes on the growers’

property rights far more than Babcock allows. When this same
California union access regulation was challenged on constitutional grounds

before the California Supreme Court in 1976, that court
upheld the regulation by a 4-to-3 vote. Agricultural Labor Rel. Bd. v. Superior
Ct. of

Tulare Cty., 546 P.2d 687. Justice William Clark wrote the
dissent. Justice Clark stressed that “property rights are fundamental.” Id.,
at, 546 P.2d

at 712, n. 4. And he concluded that the California union
access regulation “violates the rule” of Babcock and thus “violates the
constitutional

provisions protecting private property.” 546 P.2d at 713. In
my view, Justice Clark had it exactly right.

With those comments, I join the Court’s opinion in full.

■
JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.

---

Does the regulation physically appropriate the employers’
property? If so, there is no need to look further; the Government must pay the

employers “just compensation.” U.S. Const., Amdt. 5; see
Arkansas Game and Fish Comm’n v. United States, 568 U.S. 23, 31 (2012) (“
‘[W]hen

the government physically takes possession of an interest in
property for some public purpose, it has a categorical duty to compensate the
former

owner’ ”). Or does the regulation simply regulate the
employers’ property rights? If so, then there is every need to look further;
the government

need pay the employers “just compensation” only if the
regulation “goes too far.” * * *

The Court holds that the provision’s “access to organizers”
requirement amounts to a physical appropriation of property. In its view,

virtually every government-authorized invasion is an
“appropriation.” But this regulation does not “appropriate” anything; it
regulates the

employers’ right to exclude others. At the same time, our
prior cases make clear that the regulation before us allows only a temporary
invasion of

a landowner’s property and that this kind of temporary
invasion amounts to a taking only if it goes “too far.” See, e.g., Loretto v.
Teleprompter

Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 434 (1982). In my view,
the majority’s conclusion threatens to make many ordinary forms of regulation

unusually complex or impractical. And though the majority
attempts to create exceptions to narrow its rule, the law’s need for
feasibility suggests

that the majority’s framework is wrong. With respect, I
dissent from the majority’s conclusion that the regulation is a per se taking.

#1281

I

---

A

Initially it may help to look at the legal problem—a problem
of characterization—through the lens of ordinary English. The word

“regulation” rather than “appropriation” fits this provision
in both label and substance. It is contained in Title 8 of the California Code
of

Regulations. It was adopted by a state regulatory board,
namely, the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board, in 1975. It is
embedded in a

set of related detailed regulations that describe and limit
the access at issue. In addition to the hours of access just mentioned, it
provides that

union representatives can enter the property only “for the
purpose of meeting and talking with employees and soliciting their support”;
they have

access only to “areas in which employees congregate before
and after working” or “at such location or locations as the employees eat their

lunch”; and they cannot engage in “conduct disruptive of the
employer’s property or agricultural operations, including injury to crops or

machinery or interference with the process of boarding
buses.” From the employers’ perspective, it restricts when and where they can
exclude

others from their property.

At the same time, the provision only awkwardly fits the
terms “physical taking” and “physical appropriation.” The “access” that it
grants

union organizers does not amount to any traditional property
interest in land. It does not, for example, take from the employers, or provide
to the

organizers, any freehold estate (e.g., a fee simple, fee
tail, or life estate); any concurrent estate (e.g., a joint tenancy, tenancy in
common, or

tenancy by the entirety); or any leasehold estate ( e.g. , a
term of years, periodic tenancy, or tenancy at will). Nor (as all now agree)
does it provide

the organizers with a formal easement or access resembling
an easement, as the employers once argued, since it does not burden any
particular

parcel of property. Compare Pet. for Cert. i (asking the
Court to address “whether the uncompensated appropriation of an easement that
is limited

in time effects a per se physical taking under the Fifth
Amendment”), with Reply Brief 8 (“[T]he access required here does not bear all
the

hallmarks of an easement”).

The majority concludes that the regulation nonetheless
amounts to a physical taking of property because, the majority says, it
“appropriates”

a “right to invade” or a “right to exclude” others. It
thereby likens this case to cases in which we have held that appropriation of
property rights

amounts to a physical per se taking.

It is important to understand, however, that, technically
speaking, the majority is wrong. The regulation does not appropriate anything.
It

does not take from the owners a right to invade (whatever
that might mean). It does not give the union organizations the right to exclude
anyone.

It does not give the government the right to exclude anyone.

#1282

What does it do? It gives union organizers the right
temporarily to invade a portion of the property owners’ land. It thereby limits
the

landowners’ right to exclude certain others. The regulation
regulates (but does not appropriate ) the owners’ right to exclude.

Why is it important to understand this technical point?
Because only then can we understand the issue before us. That issue is whether
a

regulation that temporarily limits an owner’s right to
exclude others from property automatically amounts to a Fifth Amendment taking.
Under

our cases, it does not.

B

Our cases draw a distinction between regulations that
provide permanent rights of access and regulations that provide nonpermanent
rights

of access. They either state or hold that the first type of
regulation is a taking per se, but the second kind is a taking only if it goes
“too far.” And

they make this distinction for good reason.

Consider the Court’s reasoning in an important case in which
the Court found a per se taking. In Loretto , the Court considered the status
of

a New York law that required landlords to permit cable
television companies to install cable facilities on their property. 458 U.S. at
421. We held

that the installation amounted to a permanent physical
occupation of the property and hence to a per se taking. In reaching this
holding we

specifically said that “[n]ot every physical invasion is a
taking.” Id., at 435, n. 12 (emphasis deleted). We explained that the
“permanence and

absolute exclusivity of a physical occupation distinguish it
from temporary limitations on the right to exclude.” Loretto, 458 U.S. at 43 5,
n. 12.

And we provided an example of a federal statute that did not
effect a per se taking—an example almost identical to the regulation before us.
That

statute provided “ ‘access... limited to (i) union
organizers; (ii) prescribed non-working areas of the employer’s premises; and
(iii) the duration

of the organization activity.’ ” Id., at 434, n. 11 (quoting
Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U.S. 539, 545 (1972)).

We also explained why permanent physical occupations are
distinct from temporary limitations on the right to exclude. We said that, when

the government permanently occupies property, it “does not
simply take a single ‘strand’ from the ‘bundle’ of property rights: it chops
through

the bundle, taking a slice of every strand,” “effectively
destroy[ing]” “the rights ‘to possess, use and dispose of it.’ ” Loretto, 458
U.S. at 435. We

added that the property owner “ha[d] no right to possess the
occupied space himself, and also ha[d] no power to exclude the occupier from

possession and use of the space.” Ibid. The requirement
“forever denie[d] the owner any power to control the use of the property” or
make any

“nonpossessory use” of it. Id., at 436. It would “ordinarily
empty the right” to sell or transfer the occupied space “of any value, since
the

purchaser w[ould] also be unable to make any use of the
property.” Ibid. The owner could not “exercise control” over the equipment’s

installation, and so could not “minimize [its] physical,
esthetic, and other effects.” Id., at 441,

#1283

n. 19. Thus, we concluded, a permanent physical occupation
“is perhaps the most serious form of invasion of an owner’s property
interests.” Id.,

at 435. * * *

As these cases have used the terms, the regulation here at
issue provides access that is “temporary,” not “permanent.” Unlike the
regulation

in Loretto , it does not place a “fixed structure on land or
real property.” 458 U.S. at 437. The employers are not “forever denie[d]” “any
power to

control the use” of any particular portion of their
property. Id. , at 436. And it does not totally reduce the value of any section
of the property. Ibid.

Unlike in Nollan , the public cannot walk over the land
whenever it wishes; rather a subset of the public may enter a portion of the
land three

hours per day for four months per year (about 4% of the
time). At bottom, the regulation here, unlike the regulations in Loretto and
Nollan , is not

“functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which
government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his
domain.”

Lingle, 544 U.S. at 539.

At the same time, PruneYard ’s holding that the taking was
“temporary” (and hence not a per se taking) fits this case almost perfectly.
There

the regulation gave nonowners the right to enter privately
owned property for the purpose of speaking generally to others, about matters
of their

choice, subject to reasonable time, place, and manner
restrictions. 447 U.S. at 83. The regulation before us grants a far smaller
group of people

the right to enter landowners’ property for far more limited
times in order to speak about a specific subject. Employers have more power to

control entry by setting work hours, lunch hours, and places
of gathering. On the other hand, as the majority notes, the shopping center in

PruneYard was open to the public generally. All these
factors, however, are the stuff of which regulatory-balancing, not absolute per
se , rules are

made.

Our cases have recognized, as the majority says, that the
right to exclude is a “ ‘fundamental element of the property right.’ ” For that

reason, “[a] ‘taking’ may more readily be found when the
interference with property can be characterized as a physical invasion by
government.”

Penn Central , 438 U.S. at 124 (emphasis added); see also
Loretto , 458 U.S. at 426 (“[W]e have long considered a physical intrusion by

government to be a property restriction of an unusually
serious character for purposes of the Takings Clause”). But a taking is not
inevitably

found just because the interference with property can be
characterized as a physical invasion by the government, or, in other words,
when it

affects the right to exclude.

The majority refers to other cases. But those cases do not
help its cause. That is because the Court in those cases (some of which
preceded

Penn Central and others of which I have discussed above) did
not apply a “ per se takings” approach. In United States v. Causby , 328 U.S.
256,

259 (1946), for example, the question was whether government
flights over a piece of land constituted a taking. The flights amounted to 4%
of

the

#1284

takeoffs, and 7% of the landings, at a nearby airport. See
ibid. But the planes flew “in considerable numbers and rather close together.”
Ibid. And

the flights were “so low and so frequent as to be a direct
and immediate interference with the enjoyment and use of the land.” Id., at
266. Taken

together, those flights “destr[oyed] the use of the property
as a commercial chicken farm.” Id., at 259. Based in part on that economic
damage,

the Court found that the rule allowing these overflights
went “too far.” See id., at 266 (“ ‘[I]t is the character of the invasion, not
the amount of

damage resulting from it, so long as the damage is
substantial , that determines the question whether it is a taking’ ” (emphasis
added)).

In Portsmouth Harbor Land & Hotel Co. v. United States ,
260 U.S. 327, 329 (1922), the Court held that the Government’s firing of guns

across private property would be a taking only if the shots
were sufficiently frequent to establish an “intent to fire across the
claimants’ land at

will.” The frequency of the projectiles itself mattered less
than whether the Government acted “ ‘with the purpose and effect of
subordinating the

strip of land... to the right and privilege of the
Government to fire projectiles directly across it for the purpose of practice
or otherwise,

whenever it saw fit , in time of peace, with the result of
depriving the owner of its profitable use.’ ” Ibid. (emphasis added). Again,
the Court

balanced several factors—permanence, severity, and economic
impact—rather than treating the mere fact of entry as dispositive. * * *

If there is ambiguity in these cases, it concerns whether
the Court considered the occupation at issue to be temporary (requiring Penn

Central ’s “too far” analysis) or permanent (automatically
requiring compensation). Nothing in them suggests the majority’s view, namely,
that

compensation is automatically required for a temporary right
of access. Nor does anything in them support the distinction that the majority

gleans between “trespass” and “takings.”

The majority also refers to Nollan as support for its claim
that the “fact that a right to take access is exercised only from time to time
does

not make it any less a physical taking.” True. Here,
however, unlike in Nollan, the right taken is not a right to have access to the
property at any

time (which access different persons “exercis[e]... from
time to time”). Rather here we have a right that does not allow access at any
time. It

allows access only from “time to time.” And that makes all
the difference. A right to enter my woods whenever you wish is a right to use
that

property permanently, even if you exercise that right only
on occasion. A right to enter my woods only on certain occasions is not a right
to use

the woods permanently. In the first case one might
reasonably use the term per se taking. It is as if my woods are yours. In the
second case it is a

taking only if the regulation allowing it goes “too far,”
considering the factors we have laid out in Penn Central. That is what our
cases say.

Finally, the majority says that Nollan would have come out
the same way had it involved, similar to the regulation here, access short of
365

#1285

days a year. Perhaps so. But, if so, that likely would be
because the Court would have viewed the access as an “easement,” and therefore
an

appropriation. See Nollan, 483 U.S. at 828. Or, perhaps, the
Court would have viewed the regulation as going “too far.” I can assume, purely
for

argument’s sake, that that is so. But the law is clear: A
regulation that provides temporary , not permanent , access to a landowner’s
property, and

that does not amount to a taking of a traditional property
interest, is not a per se taking. That is, it does not automatically require
compensation.

Rather, a court must consider whether it goes “too far.”

C

The persistence of the permanent/temporary distinction that
I have described is not surprising. That distinction serves an important
purpose.

We live together in communities. Modern life in these
communities requires different kinds of regulation. Some, perhaps many, forms
of

regulation require access to private property (for
government officials or others) for different reasons and for varying periods
of time. Most such

temporary-entry regulations do not go “too far.” And it is
impractical to compensate every property owner for any brief use of their land.
As we

have frequently said, “[g]overnment hardly could go on if to
some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying
for

every such change in the general law.” Pennsylvania Coal
Co., 260 U.S. at 413. * * * Thus, the law has not, and should not, convert all

temporary-access-permitting regulations into per se takings
automatically requiring compensation.

Consider the large numbers of ordinary regulations in a host
of different fields that, for a variety of purposes, permit temporary entry
onto

(or an “invasion of”) a property owner’s land. They include
activities ranging from examination of food products to inspections for
compliance

with preschool licensing requirements. See, e.g., 29 U.S.C.
§ 657(a) (authorizing inspections and investigations of “any... workplace or

environment where work is performed” during “regular working
hours and at other reasonable times”); 21 U.S.C. § 606(a) (authorizing

“examination and inspection of all meat food products... at
all times, by day or night”); 42 U.S.C. § 5413(b) (authorizing inspections
anywhere

“manufactured homes are manufactured, stored, or held for
sale” at “reasonable times and without advance notice”); Miss. Code Ann. §
49–27–

63 (2012) (authorizing inspections of “coastal wetlands”
“from time to time”); Mich. Comp. Laws § 208.1435(5) (2010) (authorizing
inspections

of any “historic resource” “at any time during the
rehabilitation process”); Mont. Code Ann. § 81–22–304 (2019) (granting a “right
of entry...

[into] any premises where dairy products... are produced,
manufactured, [or] sold” “during normal business hours”); Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43–

1303(5) (2016) (authorizing visitation of “foster care
facilities in order to ascertain whether the individual physical,
psychological, and

sociological needs of each foster child are being met”); Va.
Code Ann. § 22.1–289.032(C)(8) (Cum. Supp. 2020) (authorizing “annual

inspection” of “preschool

#1286

programs of accredited private schools”); Cincinnati, Ohio,
Municipal Code § 603–1 (2021) (authorizing entry “at any time” for any place in

which “animals are slaughtered”); Dallas, Tex., Code of
Ordinance § 33–5(a) (2021) (authorizing inspection of “assisted living
facilit[ies]” “at

reasonable times”); 6 N. Y. Rules & Regs. § 360.7 (Supp.
2020) (authorizing inspection of solid waste management facilities “at all
reasonable

times, locations, whether announced or unannounced”); see
also Boise Cascade Corp. v. United States, 296 F.3d 1339, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2002)

(affirming an injunction requiring property owner to allow
Government agents to enter its property to conduct owl surveys).

The majority tries to deal with the adverse impact of
treating these, and other, temporary invasions as if they were per se physical
takings by

creating a series of exceptions from its per se rule. It
says: (1) “Isolated physical invasions, not undertaken pursuant to a granted
right of access,

are properly assessed as individual torts rather than
appropriations of a property right.” It also would except from its per se rule
(2) government

access that is “consistent with longstanding background
restrictions on property rights,” including “traditional common law privileges
to access

private property.” And it adds that (3) “the government may
require property owners to cede a right of access as a condition of receiving
certain

benefits, without causing a taking.” How well will this new
system work? I suspect that the majority has substituted a new, complex legal
scheme

for a comparatively simpler old one.

As to the first exception, what will count as “isolated”?
How is an “isolated physical invasion” different from a “temporary” invasion,

sufficient under present law to invoke Penn Central? And
where should one draw the line between trespass and takings? Imagine a school
bus

that stops to allow public school children to picnic on
private land. Do three stops a year place the stops outside the exception? One
stop every

week? Buses from one school? From every school? Under
current law a court would know what question to ask. The stops are temporary;
no one

assumes a permanent right to stop; thus the court will ask
whether the school district has gone “too far.” Under the majority’s approach,
the court

must answer a new question (apparently about what counts as
“isolated”).

As to the second exception, a court must focus on
“traditional common law privileges to access private property.” Just what are
they? We

have said before that the government can, without paying
compensation, impose a limitation on land that “inhere[s] in the title itself,
in the

restrictions that background principles of the State’s law
of property and nuisance already place upon land ownership.” Lucas, 505 U.S. at
1029.

But we defined a very narrow set of such background
principles. See ibid., and n. 16 (abatement of nuisances and cases of “ ‘actual
necessity’ ”

or “to forestall other grave threats to the lives and
property of others”). To these the majority adds “public or private necessity,”
the enforcement

of criminal law “under certain

#1287

circumstances,” and reasonable searches. Do only those
exceptions that existed in, say, 1789 count? Should courts apply those
privileges as they

existed at that time, when there were no union organizers?
Or do we bring some exceptions (but not others) up to date, e.g., a necessity
exception

for preserving animal habitats?

As to the third, what is the scope of the phrase “certain
benefits”? Does it include the benefit of being able to sell meat labeled
“inspected”

in interstate commerce? But see Horne, 576 U.S. at 366
(concluding that “[s]elling produce in interstate commerce” is “not a special

governmental benefit”). What about the benefit of having
electricity? Of sewage collection? Of internet accessibility? Myriad regulatory
schemes

based on just these sorts of benefits depend upon
intermittent, temporary government entry onto private property.

Labor peace (brought about through union organizing) is one
such benefit, at least in the view of elected representatives. They wrote laws

that led to rules governing the organizing of agricultural
workers. Many of them may well have believed that union organizing brings with
it

“benefits,” including community health and educational
benefits, higher standards of living, and (as I just said) labor peace. See,
e.g., 1975 Cal.

Stats. ch. 1, § 1 (stating that the purpose of the
Agricultural Labor Relations Act was to “ensure peace in the agricultural
fields by guaranteeing

justice for all agricultural workers and stability in labor
relations”). A landowner, of course, may deny the existence of these benefits,
but a

landowner might do the same were a regulatory statute to
permit brief access to verify proper preservation of wetlands or the habitat
enjoyed by

an endangered species or, for that matter, the safety of
inspected meat. So, if a regulation authorizing temporary access for purposes
of organizing

agricultural workers falls outside of the Court’s exceptions
and is a per se taking, then to what other forms of regulation does the Court’s
per se

conclusion also apply?

II

Finally, I touch briefly on remedies, which the majority
does not address. The Takings Clause prohibits the Government from taking
private

property for public use without “just compensation.” U. S.
Const., Amdt. 5. But the employers do not seek compensation. They seek only

injunctive and declaratory relief. Indeed, they did not
allege any damages. On remand, California should have the choice of foreclosing

injunctive relief by providing compensation. See, e.g. ,
Knick v. Township of Scott, 139 S. Ct. 2162, 2179 (2019) (“As long as just
compensation

remedies are available—as they have been for nearly 150
years—injunctive relief will be foreclosed”).

---

I recognize that the Court’s prior cases in this area are
not easy to apply. Moreover, words such as “temporary,” “permanent,” or “too
far” do

not define themselves. But I do not believe that the Court
has made

#1288

matters clearer or better. Rather than adopt a new broad
rule and indeterminate exceptions, I would stick with the approach that I
believe the

Court’s case law sets forth. “Better the devil we know... .”
A right of access such as the right at issue here, a nonpermanent right, is not

automatically a “taking.” It is a regulation that falls
within the scope of Penn Central. Because the Court takes a different view, I
respectfully

dissent.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1. _Cedar Point Nursery_ takes us back to the beginnings of
   the course and the rival perspectives about property: one being that it is
   grounded in the

right to exclude, the other that it is a bundle of rights.
Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, sees the California regulation
as a violation of the

right to exclude and hence as the proper subject of a per se
rule. Justice Breyer, in dissent, emphasizes that the right to exclude is
subject to many

exceptions, and hence the California rule should be regarded
as a regulation of the right to exclude governed by _Penn Central_ ’s ad hoc
standard. But

where does exclusion end and governance begin? The
discussion in the opinions of _Causby_ and airplane overflights underscores the
difficulty. Low-

level flights are subject to the right to exclude; high
level flights are subject to reasonable regulation and are not a taking at all.
But where exactly do we

draw the line where the one principle turns into the other?

2. _Cedar Point Nursery_ is also a striking illustration of
   the common law nature of the Supreme Court’s regulatory takings doctrine.
   Starting with

_Loretto_ ’s per se rule for “permanent physical
occupations,” the Court borrows the understanding that a permanent right of
access is also a per se taking

( _Nollan_ and _Dolan_ ), re-christens the relevant category
to be “appropriations” of property rather than “occupations” ( _Horne_ ),
references older cases

holding that intermittent low-level overflights and repeated
firing of shells over property can be a taking ( _Causby_ and _Portsmouth_ ),
distinguishes a case

that involves property open to the general public (
_Pruneyard_ ) and concludes that a regulation that permanently authorizes
intermittent access to property

not open to the public is subject to a per se rule. The
dissent surveys the same body of precedent, concluding that intermittent access
rights are a type of

temporary invasion, and temporary invasions are always
assessed under _Penn Central_ ’s ad hoc approach. Which stirring of the
precedent pot is correct?

By what criteria should we seek to determine which is
correct?

3 .When the Court granted review in the case, the
petitioners framed the issue in terms of whether the California regulation was
a per se taking

because it granted union organizers an easement in gross to
access the growers’ private land. The respondents’ brief on the merits pointed
out that the

access right did not conform to the California law of
easements, because it was not appurtenant to any specific burdened land, could
not be transferred,

and could not be recorded. Both the majority and the dissent
appear to accept the respondents’ understanding of California law on this
point. Does the

fact that the access right diverges from established
California property forms mean, as the dissent suggests, that the regulation
cannot be

```



1289



```

regarded as a per se taking because it does not transfer a
recognized property right to the union organizers? Or could the majority have
reasoned that the

regulation creates what is effectively a new type of
easement—a permanent right of access which can be exercised at the organizers’
discretion? Would

the creation of a new type of easement, without compensation
to the servient landowner, be a taking? Would framing the decision this way
require the

Court to develop a federal definition of “easement” for
constitutional purposes? In a decision noted later in the chapter, _Murr v_.
_Wisconsin_ , 137 S. Ct.

1933 ( 2017 ), the Court adopted a federal constitutional
definition of “parcel of land” to apply in takings cases. If “parcel” can be
given a federal

constitutional definition, why not “easement”? Or would the
Court be better advised to avoid creating new definitions of property rights
for takings

purposes?

4 .How does the Court distinguish a compulsory right of
intermittent access from a temporary invasion like a trespass? Is the
difference that the

right of access is created and authorized by enacted law,
like a statute or regulation, whereas a government trespass is an “isolated”
action taken by a

government agent? What then about entries by government
agents pursuant to statutes authorizing inspections of property in the interest
of public health

and safety? Near the end of its opinion, the Court suggests
that these sorts of licenses authorizing entry will generally be upheld either
as “background

understandings” that qualify the owner’s property rights, or
will satisfy the nexus and rough proportionality standards the Court has
developed for

exactions demanded as conditions for accepting some kind of
government permit or benefit ( _Nollan_ , _Dolan_ , and _Koontz_ ). Should the
Court have

remanded the case to the lower courts to consider whether
the right of access given by California to union organizers satisfies the nexus
and rough

proportionality tests in light of the state’s interest in
promoting collective bargaining by farm workers?

5 .After the majority opinion considers and responds to
various objections to its extension of the _Loretto_ principle, the doctrine
that emerges in

_Cedar Point_ takes the form of a rule subject to three
exceptions. The rule is not entirely clear but seems to be that any permanent
right of access to enter

private property not otherwise open to the public, even if
intermittent, is presumptively a taking. The exceptions are for (i) isolated
trespasses by

government agents that are considered torts; (ii) access
rights consistent with background understandings of property law, like the
doctrine of necessity;

and (iii) licenses that permit entry by government agents
for inspections that are consistent with the nexus and rough proportionality
rules of _Dolan_. Do

the exceptions apply to all forms of “appropriations,”
including those considered in _Loretto_ and _Horne_? Or are they limited to
access rights like those at

issue in _Cedar Point_?

6 .Are the exceptions recognized by _Cedar Point_ adequately
justified? The first two appear to be based on the Court’s generalized sense of
the

common law of property, as reflected in sources like the
Restatement of Torts. Why privilege the common law—or the Court’s idealized
conception of

the common law—rather than the law of the state in question,
including legislated law? (This issue is also presented by the exception for
background

```



1290



```

principles of law recognized in _Lucas v. South Carolina
Coastal Comm’n_ , infra.) The third exception seems to elevate the nexus and
proportionality

requirements to a generalized type of means-ends rationality
review, more commonly associated with substantive due process. Is this a proper
inquiry to

inject (even in this back-handed way) into takings law? See
Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528 ( 2005 ) (disapproving of a type of
means-ends

scrutiny in regulatory takings cases on the ground that this
is more properly a due process test).

7 .When the Court first recognized the per se rule for
permanent occupations in _Loretto_ , it did so in part because the per se
approach “avoids

otherwise difficult line-drawing problems” and “presents
relatively few problems of proof.” After the extension to intermittent rights
of access, are these

claims still plausible? Even if the inquiry is more complex,
is there still a meaningful difference between a general rule subject to
exceptions ( _Cedar

Point_ ) and a general balancing test using multiple factors
of undetermined weight ( _Penn Central_ )?

8 .The dissent notes that if California is willing to pay
just compensation to the growers, the access right can continue to be enforced.
How is

compensation going to be determined if California wants to
pursue this option? Will a study of the fair market value of different parcels
work? What

about a capitalization of lost earnings, as in the _Flight
93_ Case, supra? For an argument that the scope of takings law is generally
constrained by

established techniques for determining monetary
compensation, see Thomas W. Merrill, The Compensation Constraint and the Scope
of the Takings

Clause, 96 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1421 ( 2021 ).

9 .After _Cedar Point_ , is the rule developed in _NLRB v.
Babcock & Wilcox Co._ , 351 U.S. 105 ( 1956 ), as an interpretation of the
National Labor

Relations Act an unconstitutional taking? In _Babcock_ , the
Court held that labor organizers are permitted to trespass on company land to
contact workers

about the benefits of unionization if there is no other
reasonable basis for reaching the workers (such as handing out literature on a
public street or

sidewalk outside a plant). Is the NLRA rule distinguishable
on the ground that it entails a case-by-case consideration of circumstances,
whereas the

access right in _Cedar Point_ is permanent and
unconditional? Is the NLRA rule justified by the “background” understanding of
the defense of necessity

to a trespass to land? Can necessity be created by a
statutory entitlement or must it be grounded in common law precedent (like the
understanding that

trespass is justified when escaping from an assault)? Is the
NLRA rule justified because it satisfies the nexus and proportionality tests
taken from the

exactions cases, whereas the California regulation
considered in _Cedar Point_ is not “roughly proportionate” to the public
interest in encouraging

unionization of farm workers?

10 .After _Cedar Point_ , is the approach to determining a
landowner’s right to exclude developed in New Jersey cases like _State v.
Shack_ , supra

Chapter IV, an unconstitutional taking of property? Does the
fact that the right of access recognized in _Shack_ was developed by the New
Jersey Supreme

Court as a matter of common law exposition take it out from
under the constitutional cloud? Or should common law decisions be treated the

```



1291



```

same as statutes and regulations for takings purposes? For
more on whether courts can commit takings by changing the common law, see Stop
the Beach

Renourishment, infra.

Supreme Court of the United States, 1992.

```

■
JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court. [Lucas, a real estate
developer, acquired two vacant lots on the Isle of Palms, a barrier island

on the coast of South Carolina, for the purpose of building
and selling single-family homes on them. Before he could begin construction,
South

Carolina enacted the Beachfront Management Act, S.C.Code
Ann. § 48–39–250 et seq. (Supp. 1990), which as implemented prohibited

constructing homes on the lots.]

I

Sept. 1992, at 27, 29. Lucas’s two lots are 22 and 24 (shaded). The lines
indicate the shoreline in various years

and the erosion in the years immediately prior to the case.

B

Lucas promptly filed suit in the South Carolina Court of
Common Pleas, contending that the Beachfront Management Act’s construction bar

effected a taking of his property without just compensation.
Lucas did not take issue with the validity of the Act as a lawful exercise of
South

Carolina’s police power, but contended that the Act’s
complete

#1292

extinguishment of his property’s value entitled him to
compensation regardless of whether the legislature had acted in furtherance of
legitimate

police power objectives. Following a bench trial, the court
agreed. * * * [The trial court] found that the Beachfront Management Act
decreed a

permanent ban on construction insofar as Lucas’s lots were
concerned, and that this prohibition “deprive[d] Lucas of any reasonable
economic

use of the lots,... eliminated the unrestricted right of
use, and render[ed] them valueless.” The court thus concluded that Lucas’s
properties had

been “taken” by operation of the Act, and it ordered
respondent to pay “just compensation” in the amount of $1,232,387.50.

The Supreme Court of South Carolina reversed. It found
dispositive what it described as Lucas’s concession “that the Beachfront

Management Act [was] properly and validly designed to
preserve... South Carolina’s beaches.” Failing an attack on the validity of the
statute as

such, the court believed itself bound to accept the
“uncontested... findings” of the South Carolina Legislature that new
construction in the

coastal zone—such as petitioner intended—threatened this
public resource. The court ruled that when a regulation respecting the use of
property

is designed “to prevent serious public harm,” (citing, inter
alia , Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887)), no compensation is owing under
the

Takings Clause regardless of the regulation’s effect on the
property’s value. * * *

II

As a threshold matter, we must briefly address the Council’s
suggestion that this case is inappropriate for plenary review. [The Court held

that the case was ripe for decision, had not been rendered
moot by recent legislation, and otherwise presented a justiciable controversy.]

III

A

Prior to Justice Holmes’s exposition in Pennsylvania Coal
Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922), it was generally thought that the Takings

Clause reached only a “direct appropriation” of property,
Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457, 551 (1871), or the functional equivalent of a

“practical ouster of [the owner’s] possession,”
Transportation Co. v. Chicago, 99 U.S. 635, 642 (1879). Justice Holmes
recognized in Mahon,

however, that if the protection against physical
appropriations of private property was to be meaningfully enforced, the
government’s power to

redefine the range of interests included in the ownership of
property was necessarily constrained by constitutional limits. 260 U.S., at
414–415.

If, instead, the uses of private property were subject to
unbridled, uncompensated qualification under the police power, “the natural
tendency of

human nature [would be] to extend the qualification more and
more until at last private property disappear[ed].” Id., at 415. These
considerations

gave birth in that case to the oft-cited maxim that, “while

#1293

property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation
goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.” Ibid.

Nevertheless, our decision in Mahon offered little insight
into when, and under what circumstances, a given regulation would be seen as

going “too far” for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. In
70-odd years of succeeding “regulatory takings” jurisprudence, we have
generally

eschewed any “ ‘set formula’ ” for determining how far is
too far, preferring to “engag[e] in... essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries.”
Penn

Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104,
124 (1978) (quoting Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590, 594 (1962)). See

Epstein, Takings: Descent and Resurrection, 1987 S.Ct. Rev.
1, 4. We have, however, described at least two discrete categories of
regulatory

action as compensable without case-specific inquiry into the
public interest advanced in support of the restraint. The first encompasses

regulations that compel the property owner to suffer a
physical “invasion” of his property. In general (at least with regard to
permanent

invasions), no matter how minute the intrusion, and no
matter how weighty the public purpose behind it, we have required compensation.

[Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419
(1982).] * * *

The second situation in which we have found categorical
treatment appropriate is where regulation denies all economically beneficial or

productive use of land. See Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447
U.S. 255, 260 (1980); see also Nollan v. California Coastal Comm’n, 483 U.S.
825,

834 (1987); Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis,
480 U.S. 470, 491–492 (1987); Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &
Reclamation

Assn., Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 295–296 (1981). As we have said
on numerous occasions, the Fifth Amendment is violated when land-use regulation

“does not substantially advance legitimate state interests
or denies an owner economically viable use of his land. ” Agins, supra, 447
U.S., at 260

(citations omitted) (emphasis added).^7

#1294

We have never set forth the justification for this rule.
Perhaps it is simply, as Justice Brennan suggested, that total deprivation of
beneficial

use is, from the landowner’s point of view, the equivalent
of a physical appropriation. See San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. San Diego,
450 U.S.

621, 652 (1981) (dissenting opinion). “[F]or what is the
land but the profits thereof[?]” 1 E. Coke, Institutes, ch. 1, § 1 (1st Am. ed.
1812).

Surely, at least, in the extraordinary circumstance when no
productive or economically beneficial use of land is permitted, it is less
realistic to

indulge our usual assumption that the legislature is simply
“adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life,” Penn Central
Transportation

Co., 438 U.S., at 124, in a manner that secures an “average
reciprocity of advantage” to everyone concerned, Pennsylvania Coal Co. v.
Mahon,

260 U.S., at 415. And the functional basis for permitting
the government, by regulation, to affect property values without
compensation—that

“Government hardly could go on if to some extent values
incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such
change in

the general law,” id., at 413—does not apply to the
relatively rare situations where the government has deprived a landowner of all
economically

beneficial uses.

On the other side of the balance, affirmatively supporting a
compensation requirement, is the fact that regulations that leave the owner of

land without economically beneficial or productive options
for its use—typically, as here, by requiring land to be left substantially in
its natural

state—carry with them a heightened risk that private
property is being pressed into some form of public service under the guise of
mitigating

serious public harm. [citations omitted] As Justice Brennan
explained: “From the government’s point of view, the benefits flowing to the
public

from preservation of open space through regulation may be
equally great as from creating a wildlife refuge through formal condemnation or

increasing electricity production through a dam project that
floods private property.” San Diego Gas & Elec. Co., supra, 450 U.S., at
652

(dissenting opinion). The many statutes on the books, both
state and federal, that provide for the use of eminent domain to impose
servitudes on

private scenic lands preventing developmental uses, or to
acquire such lands altogether, suggest the practical equivalence in this
setting of

negative regulation and appropriation. [citations omitted]

B

The trial court found Lucas’s two beachfront lots to have
been rendered valueless by respondent’s enforcement of the coastal-zone

construction ban. Under Lucas’s theory of the case, which
rested upon our “no economically viable use” statements, that finding entitled
him to

compensation. Lucas believed it unnecessary to take issue
with either the

#1295

purposes behind the Beachfront Management Act, or the means
chosen by the South Carolina Legislature to effectuate those purposes. The
South

Carolina Supreme Court, however, thought [Lucas’s challenge
was barred by the] long line of this Court’s cases sustaining against Due
Process

and Takings Clause challenges the State’s use of its “police
powers” to enjoin a property owner from activities akin to public nuisances.
See

Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887) (law prohibiting
manufacture of alcoholic beverages); Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U.S. 394
(1915) (law

barring operation of brick mill in residential area); Miller
v. Schoene, 276 U.S. 272 (1928) (order to destroy diseased cedar trees to
prevent

infection of nearby orchards); Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369
U.S. 590 (1962) (law effectively preventing continued operation of quarry in

residential area).

It is correct that many of our prior opinions have suggested
that “harmful or noxious uses” of property may be proscribed by government

regulation without the requirement of compensation. For a
number of reasons, however, we think the South Carolina Supreme Court was too

quick to conclude that that principle decides the present
case. The “harmful or noxious uses” principle was the Court’s early attempt to
describe

in theoretical terms why government may, consistent with the
Takings Clause, affect property values by regulation without incurring an

obligation to compensate—a reality we nowadays acknowledge
explicitly with respect to the full scope of the State’s police power. * * *

“Harmful or noxious use” analysis was, in other words,
simply the progenitor of our more contemporary statements that “land-use
regulation

does not effect a taking if it ‘substantially advance[s]
legitimate state interests’... .” Nollan, supra, 483 U.S., at 834 (quoting
Agins v. Tiburon,

447 U.S., at 260); see also Penn Central Transportation Co.,
supra, 438 U.S., at 127; Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365, 387–388
(1926).

The transition from our early focus on control of “noxious”
uses to our contemporary understanding of the broad realm within which

government may regulate without compensation was an easy
one, since the distinction between “harm-preventing” and “benefit-conferring”

regulation is often in the eye of the beholder. It is quite
possible, for example, to describe in either fashion the ecological, economic,
and esthetic

concerns that inspired the South Carolina Legislature in the
present case. One could say that imposing a servitude on Lucas’s land is
necessary in

order to prevent his use of it from “harming” South
Carolina’s ecological resources; or, instead, in order to achieve the
“benefits” of an

ecological preserve. [citations omitted] Whether one or the
other of the competing characterizations will come to one’s lips in a
particular case

depends primarily upon one’s evaluation of the worth of
competing uses of real estate. A given restraint will be seen as mitigating
“harm” to the

adjacent parcels or securing a “benefit” for them, depending
upon the observer’s evaluation of the relative importance of the use that

#1296

the restraint favors. See Sax, Takings and the Police Power,
71 Yale L.J. 36 , 49 (1964) (“[T]he problem [in this area] is not one of
noxiousness or

harm-creating activity at all; rather it is a problem of
inconsistency between perfectly innocent and independently desirable uses”).
Whether

Lucas’s construction of single-family residences on his
parcels should be described as bringing “harm” to South Carolina’s adjacent
ecological

resources thus depends principally upon whether the
describer believes that the State’s use interest in nurturing those resources
is so important

that any competing adjacent use must yield.

When it is understood that “prevention of harmful use” was
merely our early formulation of the police power justification necessary to

sustain (without compensation) any regulatory diminution in
value; and that the distinction between regulation that “prevents harmful use”
and

that which “confers benefits” is difficult, if not
impossible, to discern on an objective, value-free basis; it becomes
self-evident that noxious-use

logic cannot serve as a touchstone to distinguish regulatory
“takings”—which require compensation—from regulatory deprivations that do not

require compensation. A fortiori the legislature’s
recitation of a noxious-use justification cannot be the basis for departing
from our categorical

rule that total regulatory takings must be compensated. If
it were, departure would virtually always be allowed. The South Carolina
Supreme

Court’s approach would essentially nullify Mahon ’s
affirmation of limits to the noncompensable exercise of the police power. Our
cases provide

no support for this: None of them that employed the logic of
“harmful use” prevention to sustain a regulation involved an allegation that
the

regulation wholly eliminated the value of the claimant’s
land. See Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn., 480 U.S., at 513–514 (Rehnquist,
C.J.,

dissenting).

Where the State seeks to sustain regulation that deprives
land of all economically beneficial use, we think it may resist compensation
only if

the logically antecedent inquiry into the nature of the
owner’s estate shows that the proscribed use interests were not part of his
title to begin

with. This accords, we think, with our “takings”
jurisprudence, which has traditionally been guided by the understandings of our
citizens

regarding the content of, and the State’s power over, the
“bundle of rights” that they acquire when they obtain title to property. It
seems to us that

the property owner necessarily expects the uses of his
property to be restricted, from time to time, by various measures newly enacted
by the

State in legitimate exercise of its police powers; “[a]s
long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must
yield to the

police power.” Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S., at
413. And in the case of personal property, by reason of the State’s
traditionally high

degree of control over commercial dealings, he ought to be
aware of the possibility that new regulation might even render his property

economically worthless (at least if the property’s only
economically productive use is sale or manufacture for sale). See Andrus v.
Allard, 444

#1297

U.S. 5 1, 66– 67 (1979) (prohibition on sale of eagle
feathers). In the case of land, however, we think the notion pressed by the
Council that title is

somehow held subject to the “implied limitation” that the
State may subsequently eliminate all economically valuable use is inconsistent
with the

historical compact recorded in the Takings Clause that has
become part of our constitutional culture.

Where “permanent physical occupation” of land is concerned,
we have refused to allow the government to decree it anew (without

compensation), no matter how weighty the asserted “public
interests” involved, Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S., at

426—though we assuredly would permit the government to
assert a permanent easement that was a pre-existing limitation upon the
landowner’s

title. * * * We believe similar treatment must be accorded
confiscatory regulations, i.e., regulations that prohibit all economically
beneficial use

of land: Any limitation so severe cannot be newly legislated
or decreed (without compensation), but must inhere in the title itself, in the

restrictions that background principles of the State’s law
of property and nuisance already place upon land ownership. A law or decree
with such

an effect must, in other words, do no more than duplicate
the result that could have been achieved in the courts—by adjacent landowners
(or

other uniquely affected persons) under the State’s law of
private nuisance, or by the State under its complementary power to abate
nuisances that

affect the public generally, or otherwise.^16

On this analysis, the owner of a lake-bed, for example,
would not be entitled to compensation when he is denied the requisite permit to

engage in a landfilling operation that would have the effect
of flooding others’ land. Nor the corporate owner of a nuclear generating
plant, when

it is directed to remove all improvements from its land upon
discovery that the plant sits astride an earthquake fault. Such regulatory
action may

well have the effect of eliminating the land’s only
economically productive use, but it does not proscribe a productive use that
was previously

permissible under relevant property and nuisance principles.
The use of these properties for what are now expressly prohibited purposes was

always unlawful, and (subject to other constitutional
limitations) it was open to the State at any point to make the implication of
those

background principles of nuisance and property law explicit.
See Michelman, Property, Utility, and Fairness, Comments on the Ethical

Foundations of “Just Compensation” Law, 80 Harv.L.Rev. 1
165, 1239–1241 (1967). In light of our traditional resort to “existing rules or

understandings that stem from an independent source such as
state law” to define the range of interests that qualify for protection as
“property”

under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, Board of Regents
of State

#1298

Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972); see, e.g.,
Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 101 1–1012 (1984); Hughes v.
Washington,

389 U.S. 29 0, 295 (1967) (Stewart, J., concurring), this
recognition that the Takings Clause does not require compensation when an owner
is

barred from putting land to a use that is proscribed by
those “existing rules or understandings” is surely unexceptional. When,
however, a

regulation that declares “off-limits” all economically
productive or beneficial uses of land goes beyond what the relevant background
principles

would dictate, compensation must be paid to sustain it.

The “total taking” inquiry we require today will ordinarily
entail (as the application of state nuisance law ordinarily entails) analysis
of,

among other things, the degree of harm to public lands and
resources, or adjacent private property, posed by the claimant’s proposed
activities,

see, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 826, 827, the
social value of the claimant’s activities and their suitability to the locality
in question,

see, e.g., id., §§ 828(a) and (b), 831, and the relative
ease with which the alleged harm can be avoided through measures taken by the
claimant

and the government (or adjacent private landowners) alike,
see, e.g., id., §§ 82 7(e), 8 28(c), 830. The fact that a particular use has
long been

engaged in by similarly situated owners ordinarily imports a
lack of any common-law prohibition (though changed circumstances or new

knowledge may make what was previously permissible no longer
so, see id., § 827, Comment g. ) So also does the fact that other landowners,

similarly situated, are permitted to continue the use denied
to the claimant.

It seems unlikely that common-law principles would have
prevented the erection of any habitable or productive improvements on

petitioner’s land; they rarely support prohibition of the
“essential use” of land, Curtin v. Benson, 222 U.S. 78, 86 (1911). The
question, however,

is one of state law to be dealt with on remand. We emphasize
that to win its case South Carolina must do more than proffer the legislature’s

declaration that the uses Lucas desires are inconsistent
with the public interest, or the conclusory assertion that they violate a
common-law

maxim such as sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas. As we
have said, a “State, by ipse dixit, may not transform private property into
public

property without compensation... .” Webb’s Fabulous
Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 164 (1980). Instead, as it would be
required

to do if it sought to restrain Lucas in a common-law action
for public nuisance, South Carolina must identify background principles of
nuisance

and property law that prohibit the uses he now intends in
the circumstances in which the property is presently found. Only on this
showing can

the State fairly claim that, in proscribing all such
beneficial uses, the Beachfront Management Act is taking nothing.^18

#1299

The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

■
JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring in the judgment. * * * In my view, reasonable
expectations must be understood in light of the whole of our legal

tradition. The common law of nuisance is too narrow a
confine for the exercise of regulatory power in a complex and interdependent
society.

Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590, 593 (1962). The State
should not be prevented from enacting new regulatory initiatives in response to

changing conditions, and courts must consider all reasonable
expectations whatever their source. The Takings Clause does not require a
static

body of state property law; it protects private expectations
to ensure private investment. I agree with the Court that nuisance prevention
accords

with the most common expectations of property owners who
face regulation, but I do not believe this can be the sole source of state
authority to

impose severe restrictions. Coastal property may present
such unique concerns for a fragile land system that the State can go further in
regulating

its development and use than the common law of nuisance
might otherwise permit. * * *

■
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, dissenting. Today the Court launches a missile to kill a
mouse. * * *

[T]he Court justifies its new rule that the legislature may
not deprive a property owner of the only economically valuable use of his land,

even if the legislature finds it to be a harmful use,
because such action is not part of the “ ‘long recognized’ ” “understandings of
our citizens.”

These “understandings” permit such regulation only if the
use is a nuisance under the common law. Any other course is “inconsistent with
the

historical compact recorded in the Takings Clause.” It is
not clear from the Court’s opinion where our “historical compact” or “citizens’

understanding” comes from, but it does not appear to be
history.

The principle that the State should compensate individuals
for property taken for public use was not widely established in America at the

time of the Revolution.

The colonists... inherited... a concept of property which
permitted extensive regulation of the use of that property for the public

benefit—regulation that could even go so far as to deny all
productive use of the property to the owner if, as Coke himself stated, the

regulation “extends to the public benefit... for this is for
the public, and every one hath benefit by it.” F. Bosselman, D. Callies, &
J.

Banta, The Taking Issue 80–81

#1300

(1973), quoting The Case of the King’s Prerogative in
Saltpetre, 12 Co.Rep. 12–13 (1606).

See also Treanor, The Origins and Original Significance of
the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, 94 Yale L.J. 694, 697, n.
9

(1985).

Even into the 19th century, state governments often felt
free to take property for roads and other public projects without paying

compensation to the owners. See M. Horwitz, The
Transformation of American Law, 1 780–1860, pp. 63–64 (1977) (hereinafter
Horwitz);

Treanor, 94 Yale L.J., at 695. As one court declared in
1802, citizens “were bound to contribute as much of [land], as by the laws of
the country,

were deemed necessary for the public convenience.”
McClenachan v. Curwen, 3 Yeates 362, 373 (Pa. 1802). There was an obvious
movement

toward establishing the just compensation principle during
the 19th century, but “there continued to be a strong current in American legal
thought

that regarded compensation simply as a ‘bounty given... by
the State’ out of ‘kindness’ and not out of justice.” Horwitz 65, quoting

Commonwealth v. Fisher, 1 Pen. & W. 462, 465 (Pa. 1830).
See also State v. Dawson, 3 Hill 100, 103 (S.C. 1836). * * *

In addition, state courts historically have been less likely
to find that a government action constitutes a taking when the affected land is

undeveloped. According to the South Carolina court, the
power of the legislature to take unimproved land without providing compensation
was

sanctioned by “ancient rights and principles.” Lindsay v.
Commissioners, 2 S.C.L. 38, 57 (1796). “Except for Massachusetts, no colony
appears

to have paid compensation when it built a state-owned road
across unimproved land. Legislatures provided compensation only for enclosed or

improved land.” Treanor, 94 Yale L.J., at 695 (footnotes
omitted). This rule was followed by some States into the 1800’s. See Horwitz
63–65.

---

Nor does history indicate any common-law limit on the
State’s power to regulate harmful uses even to the point of destroying all
economic

value. Nothing in the discussions in Congress concerning the
Takings Clause indicates that the Clause was limited by the common-law nuisance

doctrine. Common-law courts themselves rejected such an
understanding. They regularly recognized that it is “for the legislature to
interpose,

and by positive enactment to prohibit a use of property
which would be injurious to the public.” Tewksbury, 11 Metc., at 57. Chief
Justice Shaw

explained in upholding a regulation prohibiting construction
of wharves, the existence of a taking did not depend on “whether a certain
erection

in tide water is a nuisance at common law or not.” Alger, 7
Cush., at 104; see also State v. Paul, 5 R.I. 185, 193 (1858); Commonwealth v.
Parks,

30 N.E. 174 (Mass. 189 2) (Holmes, J.) (“[T]he legislature
may change the common law as to nuisances, and may move the line either way, so
as

to make things nuisances which were not so, or to make
things lawful which were nuisances”).

#1301

In short, I find no clear and accepted “historical compact”
or “understanding of our citizens” justifying the Court’s new takings doctrine.

Instead, the Court seems to treat history as a grab bag of
principles, to be adopted where they support the Court’s theory, and ignored
where they

do not. If the Court decided that the early common law
provides the background principles for interpreting the Takings Clause, then
regulation,

as opposed to physical confiscation, would not be
compensable. If the Court decided that the law of a later period provides the
background

principles, then regulation might be compensable, but the
Court would have to confront the fact that legislatures regularly determined
which uses

were prohibited, independent of the common law, and
independent of whether the uses were lawful when the owner purchased. What
makes the

Court’s analysis unworkable is its attempt to package the
law of two incompatible eras and peddle it as historical fact. * * *

■
JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting. * * * In considering Lucas’ claim, the generality
of the Beachfront Management Act is significant. The Act does

not target particular landowners, but rather regulates the
use of the coastline of the entire State. See S.C. Code Ann. § 48–39–10 (Supp.
1990).

Indeed, South Carolina’s Act is best understood as part of a
national effort to protect the coastline, one initiated by the federal Coastal
Zone

Management Act of 1972. Pub.L. 92–583, 86 Stat. 1280,
codified as amended at 16 U.S.C. § 1451 et seq. Pursuant to the federal Act,
every

coastal State has implemented coastline regulations.
Moreover, the Act did not single out owners of undeveloped land. The Act also
prohibited

owners of developed land from rebuilding if their structures
were destroyed, see 1988 S.C. Acts 634, § 3, and what is equally significant,
from

repairing erosion control devices, such as seawalls, see
S.C. Code Ann. § 48–39–290(B)(2) (Supp. 1990). In addition, in some situations,
owners

of developed land were required to “renouris[h] the beach...
on a yearly basis with an amount... of sand... not... less than one and
one-half

times the yearly volume of sand lost due to erosion.” 1988
S.C. Acts 634, § 3, p. 5140. In short, the South Carolina Act imposed
substantial

burdens on owners of developed and undeveloped land alike.
This generality indicates that the Act is not an effort to expropriate owners
of

undeveloped land.

Admittedly, the economic impact of this regulation is
dramatic and petitioner’s investment-backed expectations are substantial. Yet,
if

anything, the costs to and expectations of the owners of
developed land are even greater: I doubt, however, that the cost to owners of
developed

land of renourishing the beach and allowing their seawalls
to deteriorate effects a taking. The costs imposed on the owners of undeveloped
land,

such as petitioner, differ from these costs only in degree,
not in kind.

#1302

NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1 .On remand, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that the
restrictions imposed by the Beachfront Management Act would not have been

authorized under the South Carolina law of nuisance.
Accordingly, the Act imposed a taking. The court held that the state could
either abandon the law

or could proceed to purchase or condemn the property. In
either event, it would be liable to Mr. Lucas for having imposed a temporary
taking during the

time the ordinance blocked any development. Lucas v. South
Carolina Coastal Council, 424 S.E. 2 d 484 (S.C. 1992 ). The case was settled
when the state

agreed to pay Lucas $ 850 , 000 for the two lots, plus $ 725
, 000 in interest, attorney’s fees, and costs, for a total of $ 1 , 575 , 000.
The state then turned

around and sold the lots to another private developer, in
order to recoup some of these expenses. See Oliver A. Houck, More Unfinished
Stories: _Lucas_ ,

_Atlanta Coalition_ , and _Palila/Sweet Home_ , 75 U. Colo.
L. Rev. 331 , 366 ( 2004 ). Does the decision to sell the lots for private
development suggest, as

proponents of strong takings protection might argue, that
the regulation imposed an extreme burden on the landowner, and that once the
state was forced

to internalize this burden, it realized the regulation was
not worth it? Or does the sale for private development suggest, as opponents of
takings liability

might argue, that states have no way to recoup the external
benefits of land-use regulations, and if they have to compensate landowners for
losses this

will result in under-regulation of environmental harms? For
a variety of views, see, e.g., Fischel, Regulatory Takings, supra, at 59 – 63 ;
Vicki Been, Lucas

vs. The Green Machine: Using the Takings Clause to Promote
More Efficient Regulation?, in Property Stories 299 (Gerald Korngold &
Andrew P.

Morriss eds., 2 d ed. 2009 ); Carol M. Rose, The Story of
_Lucas_ : Environmental Land Use Regulations between Developers and the Deep
Blue Sea, in

Environmental Law Stories 237 (Oliver A. Houck & Richard
James Lazarus eds., 2005 ).

2. _Lucas_ obviously fills out the structure of categorical
   rules and ad hoc review that the Court began to develop in _Loretto_. The
   decision recognizes

two per se rules of liability: for permanent physical
occupations and for regulations that deprive owners of “all economically
beneficial or productive

use of land.” What exactly is the definition of this latter
category? It depends in significant part on whether one focuses on
“economically beneficial” or

“productive.” Is an owner deprived of all “economically
beneficial” use of land only when the land has a fair market value of zero? If
this is what _Lucas_

means, then relatively few regulations would qualify
(including the regulation in _Lucas_ itself if the record had been properly
developed on this point;

surely the land could have been sold for some positive sum
of money, if only for recreational use by neighboring property owners). The
principal type of

regulation that would meet this definition would probably be
rules requiring the remediation of hazardous wastes deposited on the land,
which can

render land unmarketable (this is called the “Brownfields”
problem). But these rules may also fall within the nuisance

```



1304



```

exception. Alternatively, all “productive” use of land could
mean that the government has denied the owner the right to build on or
otherwise

economically extract value from land, as by farming. If this
is what _Lucas_ means, then many more regulations would fall afoul of such an
understanding.

For example, governments not infrequently deny development
rights when development would entail destroying wetlands, or when it would
eliminate

the habitat of an endangered species. The Court has not
clearly resolved the ambiguity but seems in more recent summaries of the
_Lucas_ holding to

accept the zero value meaning. See, e.g., Lingle v. Chevron
U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528 , 538 ( 2005 ) (characterizing _Lucas_ as requiring
“the complete

elimination of a property’s value”).

3 .Are there other candidates for rules of per se takings
liability? Formal exercises of eminent domain clearly qualify as one. See
Tahoe-Sierra, 535

U.S. at 322 (“When the government physically takes
possession of an interest in property for some public purpose, it has a
categorical duty to

compensate the former owner, United States v. Pewee Coal
Co., 341 U.S. 114 , 115 ( 1951 ), regardless of whether the interest that is
taken constitutes an

entire parcel or merely a part thereof.”). There is language
in _Hodel v. Irving_ , 481 U.S. 704 , 717 ( 1987 ), suggesting that a complete
abrogation of the

right to transmit interests in land upon death might be
regarded as a per se taking, although the opinion is not clear about this.

4 .If there are per se rules of takings liability, are there
per se rules of nonliability? Does the nuisance regulation exception that
_Lucas_ recognizes

for what would otherwise be per se liability for total
takings constitute a per se rule of nonliability for all purposes? What if the
government permanently

occupies private property to abate what would be a
common-law nuisance? At least one court has suggested that government
occupation of property for

purposes of monitoring groundwater pollution from a
hazardous waste site is a permanent physical occupation that requires
compensation. See Hendler

v. United States, 952 F. 2 d 1364 , 1376 – 77 (Fed. Cir.
1991 ). Do you agree? Other candidates for rules of per se nonliability include
forfeitures of property

used in the commission of a crime, see Bennis v. Michigan,
516 U.S. 442 ( 1996 ); regulations that implement the navigation servitude,
mentioned in

Chapter III, see United States v. Cherokee Nation of
Oklahoma, 480 U.S. 700 ( 1987 ); and government destruction of property in
order to stop the spread

of fire, mentioned in _Mahon_ and in footnote 16 of the
Court’s opinion in _Lucas_. See David A. Dana & Thomas W. Merrill,
Property: Takings 110 – 20

( 2002 ).

5 .More generally, what should be the standard for
recognizing per se rules of takings liability or nonliability, as opposed to
treating claims under

_Penn Central_ ’s ad hoc test? Both _Lucas_ and _Palazzolo
v. Rhode Island_ , 533 U.S. 606 ( 2001 ), seem to suggest that common-law rules
enter into and

restrict the title to property when it is acquired, but
statutory rules do not, or do so only in a more qualified fashion. What might
justify privileging

common-law rules over statutory rules in this fashion? Does
this provide any clue as to the standard the Court may be implicitly relying
upon in

recognizing per se rules of liability and nonliability?

```



1305



```

6 .Justice Scalia often sought to define constitutional
rights in terms of rules rather than broad standards, see Antonin Scalia, The
Rule of Law as

the Law of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175 ( 1989 ), and
often argued that such rules should be grounded in an objective source like the
original

understanding of the Framers or in well-established
traditions and practices. See Antonin Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation 133 –
43 ( 1997 ). His effort in

_Lucas_ to define the police power exception in terms of
established principles of nuisance law is plausibly regarded as being the
product of similar

impulses. If this is his objective, however, what do you
make of his heavy reliance on the _Restatement (Second) of Torts_ as a source
for identifying

existing rules of nuisance law? Recall from _Hendricks v.
Stalnaker_ and the notes following it in Chapter I that the _Restatement_
essentially would define a

nuisance in terms of a case-by-case balancing test. Such
balancing tests were usually the last thing Justice Scalia wanted to see
adopted in constitutional

law. What then accounts for Justice Scalia’s willingness to
endorse the _Restatement_ for purposes of defining the nuisance exception to
the new per se

rule of liability for total takings? For criticism of this
aspect of the decision, see Lynn E. Blais, Takings, Statutes, and the Common
Law: Considering

Inherent Limitation on Title, 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1 ( 1996 );
Louise A. Halper, Why the Nuisance Knot Can’t Undo the Takings Muddle, 28 Ind.
L. Rev.

329 ( 1995 ). In addition to nuisance, Justice Scalia
mentions in Footnote 16 the conflagration rule as part of the “otherwise”
baseline of state law, under

which the state can legislate or regulate without takings
liability. More recently, _Cedar Point Nursery_ , supra, relied on _Lucas_ and
the idea that certain

“background principles” qualify the title to land—in that
case, various privileges of entry under conditions of necessity. Should custom
more generally

be regarded as a source of such “background principles”? See
Henry E. Smith, Community and Custom in Property, supra, at 204 – 06.

7 .Suppose A purchases two beachfront lots for $ 100 , 000 ,
intending to build houses on them. The government then imposes a regulation
that

makes it impossible to build houses on the lots. Rather than
filing a lawsuit, A sells the lots to B, for $ 10 , 000. (B may want the lots
for purposes of

sunbathing or may hold them on speculation that the
government may change its mind someday and permit them to be built on.) Can B
now file a

lawsuit challenging the no-construction regulation as a
regulatory taking? A problem of this form arose in _Palazzolo v. Rhode Island,_
533 U.S. 606

( 2001 ). The Court held that B was not barred from
challenging the regulation by a per se rule of nonliability. Instead, the
preexisting regulation, and its

impact on “reasonable investment backed expectations,” was
just another factor to be considered under the _Penn Central_ test. Does this
ignore the fact

that B paid a much-reduced price for the property, in light
of the prohibition reflected in the regulation? Or does focusing on B’s
expectations look at the

problem at the wrong moment in time? See William A. Fischel
& Perry Shapiro, Takings, Insurance, and Michelman: Comments on Economic

Interpretations of “Just Compensation” Law, 17 J. Legal
Stud. 269 ( 1988 ) (arguing that if a regulatory taking arguably occurred when
A owned the land,

then B should be regarded as having purchased both the land
and A’s cause of action for a regulatory taking). Presumably the statute of
limitations for A

bringing a regulatory takings claim starts to run when the
regulation

```



1306



```

is first imposed. Once the statute runs on any claim by A,
does this mean the government has acquired the right to regulate by
prescription, barring any

subsequent takings claim by B? Or does the statute start to
run again each time the land is transferred?

8 .Justice Blackmun’s dissent marshals considerable evidence
suggesting that regulations of the use of property were not thought to be
“takings” at

the time the Fifth Amendment was adopted. Does this mean
that _Lucas_ ’s interpretation of the Takings Clause is contrary to the
original understanding of

the Framers? This would be ironic, because Justice Scalia,
and some of the Justices who joined his opinion (most notably Justice Thomas)
have

frequently criticized the Court for deviating from the
original understanding in its interpretation of the Constitution. See Kelo v.
City of New London,

supra (Thomas, J., dissenting). Or does the question of
original understanding depend on the level of generality with which one
describes the views of

the Framers? There is no question the members of the framing
generation venerated private property and regarded the protection of property
to be a

central task of government. See generally Jennifer Nedelsky,
Private Property and the Limits of American Constitutionalism ( 1990 ). If the
important

“understanding” was that private property should be
protected against harsh and oppressive government action, is it contrary to the
original

understanding to hold that regulations that go beyond
traditional nuisance regulation and deny owners all economically beneficial use
of property are

takings? Also, since the Court here is technically applying
the Fourteenth Amendment, which incorporates the Fifth Amendment’s Takings
Clause, is the

relevant history that of the Fourteenth Amendment? See
Michael B. Rappaport, Originalism and Regulatory Takings: Why the Fifth
Amendment May

Not Protect Against Regulatory Takings, But the Fourteenth
Amendment May, 45 San Diego L. Rev. 729 ( 2008 ).

9 .If because of global warming it becomes necessary to
evacuate barrier islands like the Isle of Palms and other low-lying coastal
areas to avoid

the effects of repeated devastation by storms and flooding,
should the government be required to pay compensation to all persons whose
property values

are wiped out in the process? How do we distinguish between
property destroyed by acts of God or nature (with or without an assist from
human

activity) and those wiped out by acts of government in
response to these phenomena? Consider again in this connection the
conflagration rule mentioned

in _Mahon_ and in footnote 16 of Justice Scalia’s opinion in
_Lucas_. Does the debate between Justice Scalia and Justice Stevens about the
generality of the

Beachfront Management Act—whether or not it unfairly singles
out David Lucas for harsh treatment—also have a bearing on this question? See
J. Peter

Byrne, Rising Seas and Common Law Baselines: A Comment on
Regulatory Takings Discourse Concerning Climate Change, 11 Vt. J. Envtl. L. 625

( 2010 ).

10. _Lucas_ generated much critical scholarship in its
    aftermath. Some, most notably Richard Epstein, criticized the Court for not
    going far enough,

having declined to find that a partial infringement of a
property interest could also be a per se taking. See Richard A. Epstein, _Lucas
v. South Carolina

Coastal Council_ : A Tangled Web of Expectations, 45 Stan.
L. Rev.

```



1307



```

1369 ( 1993 ). Others criticized the Court’s
backwards-looking approach as going too far in handcuffing modern legislatures
that might want to adopt

regulations protecting sensitive environmental areas. See
Eric T. Freyfogle, The Owning and Taking of Sensitive Lands, 43 UCLA L. Rev. 77
, 119 – 21

( 1995 ). Still others questioned the precedential value of
the case in light of subsequent decisions and the idiosyncratic nature of the
facts (rarely is all the

economic value of a property destroyed). See Richard
Lazarus, Putting the Correct “Spin” on _Lucas_ , 45 Stan. L. Rev. 1411 , 1425 (
1993 ); Joseph L. Sax,

Property Rights and the Economy of Nature: Understanding
Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 45 Stan. L. Rev. 1433 ( 1993 ).

The Denominator Problem

The denominator problem that arose in applying the
diminution in value test under Pennsylvania Coal and Penn Central is also
critical

under the Lucas “total takings” test, at least if we
interpret that test to mean that the regulation has deprived the owner of 100
per cent of the

value of the property. For purpose of a diminution in value
analysis under either Penn Central or Lucas ’s total takings test, courts must
do a

before-and-after comparison of values. More precisely, they
must compare the “numerator”—the value of the property taken by the regulation—

to the “denominator”—the value of the property before the
regulation.

As suggested by the dueling opinions of Justices Holmes and
Brandeis in Pennsylvania Coal , the critical issue here concerns the definition

of the “denominator.” Recall that in that case, Justice
Holmes appeared to assume that the denominator was the pillars of coal that had
to remain

in place under the regulation, but which could have been
mined in the absence of the regulation. Justice Brandeis, in contrast, argued
that the

denominator should be the “whole property” of the coal
company. In more recent opinions, the Court has generally endorsed the
suggestion,

made in passing in Penn Central , that the denominator
should be the claimant’s “whole parcel.” See, e.g., Keystone Bituminous Coal
Ass’n v.

DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 498 (1987).

Footnote 7 in Lucas adds little to our understanding of the
problem. Justice Scalia disapproved of the New York Court of Appeals decision

in Penn Central , which had suggested that the denominator
should be expressed in terms of the “total value of the takings claimant’s
other

holdings in the vicinity.” But he ultimately concluded it
was unnecessary to resolve the denominator question because Lucas had a fee
simple

interest in real estate, and there was no question but that
this was the interest that was claimed to have been taken.

Potential issues about the proper definition of the
denominator continued to arise in the Court’s post- Lucas decisions. In
Tahoe-Sierra

Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency
, 535 U.S. 302 (2002), the Court considered whether a 32-month moratorium on

all development of land fell within the categorical rule
identified in Lucas for total takings of economic value. The Court held that
such a

#1308

moratorium should be assessed under the Penn Central ad hoc
approach, not the categorical approach of Lucas. One reason Justice Stevens
cited

in favor of this result was that the denominator should not
be defined unduly narrowly in temporal terms any more than in physical terms.
His

majority opinion said in part:

* * * Petitioners seek to bring this case under the rule
      announced in Lucas by arguing that we can effectively sever a 32-month

segment from the remainder of each landowner’s fee simple
estate, and then ask whether that segment has been taken in its entirety by

the moratoria. Of course, defining the property interest
taken in terms of the very regulation being challenged is circular. With
property

so divided, every delay would become a total ban; the
moratorium and the normal permit process alike would constitute categorical

takings. Petitioners’ “conceptual severance” argument is
unavailing because it ignores Penn Central’s admonition that in regulatory

takings cases we must focus on “the parcel as a whole.” 438
U.S., at 130–131. We have consistently rejected such an approach to the

“denominator” question. See Keystone, 480 U.S., at 497. See
also Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers

Pension Trust for Southern Cal., 508 U.S. 602, 644 (1993)
(“To the extent that any portion of property is taken, that portion is always

taken in its entirety; the relevant question, however, is
whether the property taken is all, or only a portion of, the parcel in
question”).

---

An interest in real property is defined by the metes and
bounds that describe its geographic dimensions and the term of years that

describes the temporal aspect of the owner’s interest. See
Restatement of Property §§ 7–9 (1936). Both dimensions must be considered

if the interest is to be viewed in its entirety. Hence, a
permanent deprivation of the owner’s use of the entire area is a taking of “the

parcel as a whole,” whereas a temporary restriction that
merely causes a diminution in value is not. Logically, a fee simple estate

cannot be rendered valueless by a temporary prohibition on
economic use, because the property will recover value as soon as the

prohibition is lifted. * * *

535 U.S. at 331–32.

Another source of ambiguity concerns the exact dimensions of
the “whole parcel” in any given situation. Suppose, for example, a developer

owns a tract of 20 acres, which has been subdivided into 40
lots, which have not yet been developed or sold. Is the “whole parcel” the 20
acres,

or is it each individual lot? Does the answer change the
minute one of the lots is sold?

Many thought the Court would clarify how to define the
physical dimensions of the “whole parcel” in Murr v. Wisconsin , 137 S. Ct.
1933

(2017). The specific question was whether a state may
consider two

#1309

adjacent parcels of land owned by the same owner as one
parcel for zoning purposes (limiting the owner to constructing one house on the
two

lots), or whether each parcel must be regarded as a separate
interest in property (more likely a taking as to one of the two parcels if it
could not

be separately developed with a house). The Court held that
the determination of the relevant denominator is to be determined by a federal

constitutional standard that looks to the owner’s
“reasonable expectations” as derived from “background customs and the whole of
our legal

tradition.” Id. at 1945. In particular, courts should
examine multiple factors, including whether the lots are considered separate or
merged as a

matter of state and local law, the physical characteristics
of the property including whether it is subject to or likely to be subject to
environmental

or other regulation, and the value of the land under the
challenged regulation. Id. at 1945–46. Applying these factors, the Court
concluded that

the proper denominator in Murr was the combined parcels.
Having defined the whole parcel in this way, the Court held that the zoning
restriction

limiting the Murrs to construction of one house was neither
a total taking under Lucas nor a taking under Penn Central ’s ad hoc standard.

Commentators have generally been critical of Murr. They
point out that it adds a second multi-factor test to determine the denominator

which must then be applied under the Lucas test or Penn
Central ’s multi-factor approach. See Maureen E. Brady, Penn Central Squared:
What

the Many Factors of Murr v. Wisconsin Mean for Property
Federalism, 166 U. Pa. L. Rev. Online 53 (2017); Nicole Stelle Garnett, From a

Muddle to a Mudslide: Murr v. Wisconsin , 2017 Cato Sup. Ct.
Rev. 131. Moreover, it is not clear that creating a new federal definition of

“parcel” is required to prevent manipulation of denominators
to affect the outcome of regulatory takings challenges. This concern could be

addressed by applying the state law subject to an exception
if the evidence suggests state law has been deliberately manipulated to affect
an

anticipated takings challenge, which will be uncommon given
the low rate of success for regulatory takings claims. Thomas W. Merrill,
Choice

of Law in Takings Cases, 8 Brigham-Kanner Prop. Rights. J.
45 (2019).

Whatever the merits of Murr , it will undoubtedly compound
the complexity and uncertainty of any regulatory takings approach that relies
in

whole or part on the idea of diminution in value. Diminution
in value was increasingly seen as a losing argument before Murr , and Murr
supplies

an additional reason to avoid attempting to establish a
regulatory taking by pointing to the economic impact of the regulation.

The Meaning of “Property” for Regulatory Takings Purposes

Most regulatory takings cases, like most eminent domain
proceedings, involve property in land. Consequently, in most cases there is no

dispute about whether the interest allegedly taken is
“property.” On occasion, however, regulatory takings claims present more novel
types of

#1310

interests, requiring the courts to determine whether the
interest is “private property” protected by the Takings Clause. For the most
part, the

Supreme Court has sought to resolve “Is it property?”
questions in the regulatory takings context by following the general precepts
laid down in

Board of Regents v. Roth , 408 U.S. 564 (1972), a procedural
due process case excerpted in Part B, supra. That is, the Court has said that
whether

a claimant has “private property” is to be determined by
looking to independent sources such as state law. As in the procedural due
process

context, the Court has not been very clear about whether one
looks to state law for the definition of property, or only to determine the
nature of

the claimant’s interest, with the characterization whether
it is “private property” being a matter of federal constitutional law. See
generally David

A. Dana & Thomas W. Merrill, Property: Takings ch. IV
(2002). Whatever methodology it has followed, the Court for the most part has
reached

what appear to be defensible conclusions about what is and
is not “private property” for takings purposes. Thus, the Court has concluded
that

leases, trade secrets, and flowage easements are “private
property,” see id. at 59–60 n.89, but that the head of water in a river, a
delegated power

of eminent domain, and the right to receive future social
security benefits are not, id. at 60 n.90.

One especially contentious issue has involved Interest on
Lawyer Trust Accounts or IOLTAs. Lawyers often hold client funds for various

purposes, such as advances on anticipated expenses. Under
banking regulations, these funds usually cannot be deposited in
interest-earning bank

accounts. But they can be combined and placed in trust
accounts that pay interest, provided the interest is dedicated to a charitable
purpose.

Many state bar associations therefore required that
attorneys place such client funds in trust accounts, with the interest used to
underwrite legal

services to the poor. In Phillips v. Washington Legal
Foundation , 524 U.S. 1 56, 163 (1998), the Court ruled 5–4 that interest
earned on sums

deposited in IOLTA accounts is the “private property” of the
client for Takings Clause purposes, even though the interest would not exist
but for

the IOLTA account. In reaching this decision, the Court
majority purported to follow the methodology for identifying “property”
developed in

Roth , which focuses on whether independent sources of state
law recognize an interest in property. In applying this methodology, however,
the

Court ignored the state rules requiring the deposit of such
funds in IOLTA accounts, and instead emphasized that “interest follows
principal” as a

matter of common law. Id. at 165–66. In this sense, the
decision is consistent with Lucas , which insists that an owner’s title is
qualified by

common-law nuisance rules in effect when the property is
acquired, but not by statutory rules in effect when the property is acquired.
Is it

plausible to think that “property” is defined solely by
judge-made rules of decision, and not also by state statutory law? Many forms
of property,

like the condominium, have been made possible only by
legislation. Some kinds of property rights, like intellectual property, are
almost entirely

of statutory creation.

#1311

Another potentially significant decision, Eastern
Enterprises v. Apfel , 524 U.S. 498 (1998), raised the question whether a
statute that

imposes a general liability on employers in the coal mining
industry to fund health care benefits for retirees can be challenged under the
Takings

Clause. Justice O’Connor, writing for a plurality of four,
answered yes; she and the Justices who joined her opinion would have
invalidated the

provision, which applied retroactively, as an uncompensated
taking of property. Justice Kennedy concurred only in the judgment. He argued
that

the law did not affect any identifiable assets of the
employers, and hence could not be challenged as a taking. Nevertheless, he
provided the fifth

vote to invalidate the law, on the ground that it violated
substantive due process. Justice Breyer, writing for four dissenters, also
agreed that the

Takings Clause did not apply, because the law imposed only a
general liability, and did not purport to take or regulate any discrete assets.
Given

that five Justices rejected the application of the Takings
Clause, Eastern Enterprises suggests that “private property” for purposes of
the Takings

Clause refers to identifiable things or discrete assets
taken by the government, but does not apply when the government simply imposes
a general

liability or tax that can be satisfied out of any source of
wealth. The Court arguably drew back from the discrete asset requirement in
Koontz v. St.

Johns River Water Management District , supra, where the
Court held that an exaction in the form of cash as a condition of permitting

development would constitute a per se taking if imposed on a
freestanding basis. Since the cash could be supplied from any source, this
seems

more like a general liability. See Thomas W. Merrill, The
Landscape of Constitutional Property, 86 Va. L. Rev. 885, 974–78 (2000); Laura
S.

Underkuffler, Tahoe ’s Requiem: The Death of the Scalian
View of Property and Justice, 21 Const. Comment. 727, 740–46 (2004).

Another case that bears on the meaning of property for
constitutional purposes is College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid
Postsecondary

Education , 527 U.S. 666 (1999). The issue was whether
Congress could subject the states to suits for false advertising under the
Lanham Act

given its power to enact appropriate legislation to enforce
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. College Savings Bank, the

plaintiff, argued that the Lanham Act could be adopted under
this power, since it was designed to protect the plaintiff’s “property” against

deprivations by the state without due process. The Court
rejected this argument on the ground that the plaintiff had no “property right”
in being

free from false advertising by the state. Writing for a bare
majority of five, Justice Scalia wrote in part as follows:

The hallmark of a protected property interest is the right
to exclude others. That is “one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of

rights that are commonly characterized as property.” That is
why the right that we all possess to use the public lands is not the

“property” right of anyone—hence the sardonic

#1312

maxim, explaining what economists call the “tragedy of the
commons,” res publica, res nullius. The Lanham Act may well contain

provisions that protect constitutionally cognizable property
interests—notably, its provisions dealing with infringement of trademarks,

which are the “property” of the owner because he can exclude
others from using them. The Lanham Act’s false advertising provisions,

however, bear no relationship to any right to exclude; and
Florida Prepaid’s [the state agency’s] alleged misrepresentations concerning

its own products intruded upon no interest over which
petitioner had exclusive dominion.

Id. at 673 (citations omitted).

Does this passage suggest that the Court is prepared to
endorse an essentialist conception of property centered on the right to exclude
others

as the definition of property for federal constitutional
purposes? Interestingly, the Court made no mention of Roth and the importance
of

independent sources like state law in either Eastern
Enterprises or College Savings Bank. Does this mean the Court is prepared to
abandon the

Roth approach to defining property for constitutional
purposes, at least insofar as it now sees the need to develop a general federal
conception of

what kinds of state-created interests might qualify as
property? Consider also Cedar Point Nursery , supra, which seems to elevate the
“right to

exclude” to constitutional status for takings purposes.

One issue that remains unresolved is whether intellectual
property rights should be regarded as “property” for Takings Clause purposes.
The

Supreme Court has sent mixed signals about this. In Horne v.
Department of Agriculture , 576 U.S. 350 (2015), which held that personal
property

(raisins) appropriated by the government for a public use is
governed by a Loretto -style per se rule, the Court went out of its way to
quote a

nineteenth-century decision which said a patent could not be
appropriated by the government without just compensation. Id. at 359–60,
quoting

James v. Campbell, 104 U.S. 356, 358 (1882). But in Oil
States Energy Services, LLC v. Greene’s Energy Group, LLC , 138 S. Ct. 1365
(2018),

the Court characterized patents as a “public franchise” that
can be cancelled through an administrative process without the full evaluation
of an

Article III court. And in Allen v. Cooper , 140 S. Ct. 994,
1008 (2020), Justice Thomas, in a concurring opinion, cautioned that the Court
has not

resolved whether copyrights are regarded as property for
constitutional purposes. For lower court decisions, see Zoltek Corp. v. United
States,

442 F.3d 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (holding patents
are not protected under the Takings Clause); Jim Olive Photography v.
University of

Houston System, 624 S.W 3d. 764 (Tex. 202 1) (declining to
reach the question whether copyrights are protected property under the Takings

Clause in the context of a case alleging copyright
infringement by a state university). For contrasting

#1313

evaluations of the historical record, see Adam Mossoff,
Patents as Constitutional Private Property: The Historical Protection of
Patents under the

Takings Clause, 87 B.U. L. Rev. 689 (2007) (arguing that
historically patents were property for purposes of the Takings Clause); Greg
Reilly,

Power Over the Patent Right, 95 Tulane L. Rev. 211 (2021)
(contesting this reading of the history).

During the Covid pandemic a proposal was advanced to “waive”
international protection for the patents of drug makers who have produced

vaccines against the COVID-19 virus. The rationale for the
proposal was to speed the production of these vaccines around the world, by

effectively turning the vaccines into generic drugs. Would
this constitute a taking of the manufacturers’ patents? A federal statute, 28
U.S.C.

§ 1498, effectively allows the federal government to obtain
a compulsory license to use any patented technology, upon a determination of
just

compensation. Would this be a better mechanism for speeding
up production of Covid vaccines? The government could invoke its right to a

compulsory license, and then authorize other drug companies
to produce the patented vaccines.

■
JUSTICE SCALIA announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of
the Court with respect to Parts I, IV, and V, and an opinion

with respect to Parts II and III, in which THE CHIEF
JUSTICE, JUSTICE THOMAS, and JUSTICE ALITO join. We consider a claim that the
decision of a

State’s court of last resort took property without just
compensation in violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as
applied against

the States through the Fourteenth.

I

A

Generally speaking, state law defines property interests,
including property rights in navigable waters and the lands underneath them. In

Florida, the State owns in trust for the public the land
permanently submerged beneath navigable waters and the foreshore (the land
between the

low-tide line and the mean high-water line). Fla. Const.,
Art. X, § 1 1; Broward v. Mabry, 50 So. 826, 829–830 (1909). Thus, the mean
high-water

line (the average reach of high tide over the preceding 19
years) is the ordinary boundary between private beachfront, or littoral
property, and

state-owned land.

Littoral owners have, in addition to the rights of the
public, certain “special rights” with regard to the water and the foreshore,
Broward, 50

#1314

So., at 830, rights which Florida considers to be property,
generally akin to easements, see ibid.; Thiesen v. Gulf, Florida & Alabama
R. Co., 78

So. 491, 500, 507 (1918) (on rehearing). These include the
right of access to the water, the right to use the water for certain purposes,
the right to

an unobstructed view of the water, and the right to receive
accretions and relictions to the littoral property. This is generally in accord
with well-

established common law, although the precise property rights
vary among jurisdictions.

At the center of this case is the right to accretions and
relictions. Accretions are additions of alluvion (sand, sediment, or other
deposits) to

waterfront land; relictions are lands once covered by water
that become dry when the water recedes. (For simplicity’s sake, we shall refer
to

accretions and relictions collectively as accretions, and
the process whereby they occur as accretion.) In order for an addition to dry
land to

qualify as an accretion, it must have occurred gradually and
imperceptibly—that is, so slowly that one could not see the change occurring,

though over time the difference became apparent. When, on
the other hand, there is a “sudden or perceptible loss of or addition to land
by the

action of the water or a sudden change in the bed of a lake
or the course of a stream,” the change is called an avulsion.

In Florida, as at common law, the littoral owner
automatically takes title to dry land added to his property by accretion; but
formerly

submerged land that has become dry land by avulsion
continues to belong to the owner of the seabed (usually the State). Thus,
regardless of

whether an avulsive event exposes land previously submerged
or submerges land previously exposed, the boundary between littoral property
and

sovereign land does not change; it remains (ordinarily) what
was the mean high-water line before the event. See Bryant v. Peppe, 238 So. 2d
836,

838–839 (Fla. 1970). It follows from this that, when a new
strip of land has been added to the shore by avulsion, the littoral owner has
no right to

subsequent accretions. Those accretions no longer add to his
property, since the property abutting the water belongs not to him but to the
State.

B

In 196 1, Florida’s Legislature passed the Beach and Shore
Preservation Act, 1961 Fla. Laws ch. 61–246, as amended, Fla. Stat. §§ 161.011–

161.45 (2007). The Act establishes procedures for “beach
restoration and nourishment projects,” designed to deposit sand on eroded
beaches

(restoration) and to maintain the deposited sand
(nourishment). A local government may apply to the Department of Environmental
Protection

for the funds and the necessary permits to restore a beach.
When the project involves placing fill on the State’s submerged lands,
authorization is

required from the Board of Trustees of the Internal
Improvement Trust Fund, which holds title to those lands.

Once a beach restoration “is determined to be undertaken,”
the Board sets what is called “an erosion control line.” It must be set by

#1315

reference to the existing mean high-water line, though in
theory it can be located seaward or landward of that.^2 Much of the project
work occurs

seaward of the erosion-control line, as sand is dumped on
what was once submerged land. The fixed erosion-control line replaces the
fluctuating

mean high-water line as the boundary between privately owned
littoral property and state property. Once the erosion-control line is
recorded, the

common law ceases to increase upland property by accretion
(or decrease it by erosion). Thus, when accretion to the shore moves the mean
high-

water line seaward, the property of beachfront landowners is
not extended to that line (as the prior law provided), but remains bounded by
the

permanent erosion-control line. Those landowners “continue
to be entitled,” however, “to all common-law riparian rights” other than the
right to

accretions. If the beach erodes back landward of the
erosion-control line over a substantial portion of the shoreline covered by the
project, the

Board may, on its own initiative, or must, if asked by the
owners or lessees of a majority of the property affected, direct the agency
responsible

for maintaining the beach to return the beach to the
condition contemplated by the project. If that is not done within a year, the
project is canceled

and the erosion-control line is null and void. Finally, by
regulation, if the use of submerged land would “unreasonably infringe on
riparian

rights,” the project cannot proceed unless the local
governments show that they own or have a property interest in the upland
property adjacent to

the project site.

C

In 2 003, the city of Destin and Walton County applied for
the necessary permits to restore 6.9 miles of beach within their jurisdictions
that

had been eroded by several hurricanes. The project
envisioned depositing along that shore sand dredged from further out. It would
add about 75

feet of dry sand seaward of the mean high-water line (to be
denominated the erosion-control line). The Department issued a notice of intent
to

award the permits, and the Board approved the
erosion-control line.

The petitioner here, Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc., is
a nonprofit corporation formed by people who own beachfront property

bordering the project area (we shall refer to them as the
Members). It brought an administrative challenge to the proposed project, which
was

unsuccessful; the Department approved the permits.
Petitioner then challenged that action in state court under the Florida
Administrative

Procedure Act. The District Court of Appeal for the First
District concluded that, contrary to the Act’s preservation of “all common-law
riparian

rights,” the order had eliminated two of the Members’
littoral rights: (1) the right to receive accretions to their property; and (2)
the

#1316

right to have the contact of their property with the water
remain intact. This, it believed, would be an unconstitutional taking, which
would

“unreasonably infringe on riparian rights,” and therefore
require the showing * * * that the local governments owned or had a property
interest in

the upland property. It set aside the Department’s final
order approving the permits and remanded for that showing to be made. It also
certified to

the Florida Supreme Court the following question (as
rephrased by the latter court):

On its face, does the Beach and Shore Preservation Act
unconstitutionally deprive upland owners of littoral rights without just

compensation?^3

The Florida Supreme Court answered the certified question in
the negative, and quashed the First District’s remand. It faulted the Court of

Appeal for not considering the doctrine of avulsion, which
it concluded permitted the State to reclaim the restored beach on behalf of the
public.

It described the right to accretions as a future contingent
interest, not a vested property right, and held that there is no littoral right
to contact with

the water independent of the littoral right of access, which
the Act does not infringe. Petitioner sought rehearing on the ground that the
Florida

Supreme Court’s decision itself effected a taking of the
Members’ littoral rights contrary to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the
Federal

Constitution.^4 The request for rehearing was denied. We
granted certiorari.

II

A

Before coming to the parties’ arguments in the present case,
we discuss some general principles of our takings jurisprudence. The Takings

Clause—“nor shall private property be taken for public use,
without just compensation,” U.S. Const., Amdt. 5—applies as fully to the taking
of a

landowner’s riparian rights as it does to the taking of an
estate in land. Moreover, though the classic taking is a transfer of property
to the State or

to another private party by eminent domain, the Takings
Clause applies to other state actions that achieve the same thing. Thus, when
the

government uses its own property in such a way that it
destroys private property, it has taken that property. See United States v.
Causby, 328 U.S.

256, 2 61–262 (1946); Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 80 U.S. 166
(1872). Similarly, our doctrine of regulatory takings “aims to identify
regulatory

actions that are functionally equivalent to the classic
taking.”

#1317

Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 539 (2005).
Thus, it is a taking when a state regulation forces a property owner to submit
to a

permanent physical occupation, Loretto v. Teleprompter
Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 425–426 (1982), or deprives him of all

economically beneficial use of his property, Lucas v. South
Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1019 (1992). Finally (and here we

approach the situation before us), States effect a taking if
they recharacterize as public property what was previously private property.
See

Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155,
163–165 (1980).

The Takings Clause (unlike, for instance, the Ex Post Facto
Clauses, see Art. I, § 9, cl. 3 ; § 10, cl. 1) is not addressed to the action
of a

specific branch or branches. It is concerned simply with the
act, and not with the governmental actor (“nor shall private property be taken
”

(emphasis added)). There is no textual justification for
saying that the existence or the scope of a State’s power to expropriate
private property

without just compensation varies according to the branch of
government effecting the expropriation. Nor does common sense recommend such a

principle. It would be absurd to allow a State to do by
judicial decree what the Takings Clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat. *

In sum, the Takings Clause bars the State from taking
private property without paying for it, no matter which branch is the
instrument of the

taking. To be sure, the manner of state action may matter:
Condemnation by eminent domain, for example, is always a taking, while a
legislative,

executive, or judicial restriction of property use may or
may not be, depending on its nature and extent. But the particular state actor
is irrelevant.

If a legislature or a court declares that what was once an
established right of private property no longer exists, it has taken that
property, no less

than if the State had physically appropriated it or
destroyed its value by regulation. “[A] State, by ipse dixit , may not
transform private property

into public property without compensation.” [Webb’s Fabulous
Pharmacies, supra at 164.]

B

JUSTICE BREYER’s concurrence says that we need neither (1)
to decide whether the judiciary can ever effect a taking, nor (2) to establish
the

standard for determining whether it has done so. The second
part of this is surely incompatible with JUSTICE BREYER’s conclusion that the

“Florida Supreme Court’s decision in this case did not
amount to a ‘judicial taking.’ ” One cannot know whether a takings claim is
invalid

without knowing what standard it has failed to meet. Which
means that JUSTICE BREYER must either (a) grapple with the artificial question
of what

would constitute a judicial taking if there were such a
thing as a judicial taking (reminiscent of the perplexing question how much
wood would a

woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?), or (b)
answer in the negative what he considers to be the “unnecessary”

#1318

constitutional question whether there is such a thing as a
judicial taking. * * *

JUSTICE BREYER cannot decide that petitioner’s claim fails
without first deciding what a valid claim would consist of. His agreement with

Part IV of our opinion necessarily implies agreement with
the test for a judicial taking (elaborated in Part II-A) which Part IV applies:
whether

the state court has “declare[d] that what was once an
established right of private property no longer exists.” JUSTICE BREYER must
either agree

with that standard or craft one of his own. And agreeing to
or crafting a hypothetical standard for a hypothetical constitutional right is
sufficiently

unappealing (we have eschewed that course many times in the
past) that JUSTICE BREYER might as well acknowledge the right as well. Or he

could avoid the need to agree with or craft a hypothetical
standard by denying the right. But embracing a standard while being coy about
the right

is, well, odd; and deciding this case while addressing
neither the standard nor the right is quite impossible. * * *

C

Like JUSTICE BREYER’s concurrence, JUSTICE KENNEDY’s
concludes that the Florida Supreme Court’s action here does not meet the
standard

for a judicial taking, while purporting not to determine
what is the standard for a judicial taking, or indeed whether such a thing as a
judicial

taking even exists. That approach is invalid for the reasons
we have discussed.* * *

III

Respondents put forward a number of arguments which
contradict, to a greater or lesser degree, the principle discussed above, that
the

existence of a taking does not depend upon the branch of
government that effects it. First, in a case claiming a judicial taking they
would add to

our normal takings inquiry a requirement that the court’s
decision have no “fair and substantial basis.” This is taken from our
jurisprudence

dealing with the question whether a state-court decision
rests upon adequate and independent state grounds, placing it beyond our
jurisdiction to

review. To assure that there is no “evasion” of our
authority to review federal questions, we insist that the nonfederal ground of
decision have

“fair support.” Broad River Power Co. v. South Carolina ex
rel. Daniel, 281 U.S. 537, 540 (1930); see also Ward v. Board of Comm’rs of
Love

Cty., 253 U.S. 17, 22–23 (1920). A test designed to
determine whether there has been an evasion is not obviously appropriate for
determining

whether there has been a taking of property. But if it is to
be extended there it must mean (in the present context) that there is a “fair
and

substantial basis” for believing that petitioner’s Members
did not have a property right to future accretions which the Act would take
away. This

is no

#1319

different, we think, from our requirement that petitioners’
Members must prove the elimination of an established property right.^9

Next, respondents argue that federal courts lack the
knowledge of state law required to decide whether a judicial decision that
purports

merely to clarify property rights has instead taken them.
But federal courts must often decide what state property rights exist in
nontakings

contexts, see, e.g., Board of Regents of State Colleges v.
Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577–578 (1972) (Due Process Clause). And indeed they must

decide it to resolve claims that legislative or executive
action has effected a taking. For example, a regulation that deprives a
property owner of

all economically beneficial use of his property is not a
taking if the restriction “inhere[s] in the title itself, in the restrictions
that background

principles of the State’s law of property and nuisance
already place upon land ownership.” Lucas, 505 U.S., at 1029. A constitutional
provision

that forbids the uncompensated taking of property is quite
simply insusceptible of enforcement by federal courts unless they have the
power to

decide what property rights exist under state law.

Respondents also warn us against depriving common-law
judging of needed flexibility. That argument has little appeal when directed

against the enforcement of a constitutional guarantee
adopted in an era when, as we said, courts had no power to “change” the common
law. But

in any case, courts have no peculiar need of flexibility. It
is no more essential that judges be free to overrule prior cases that establish
property

entitlements than that state legislators be free to revise
pre-existing statutes that confer property entitlements, or agency-heads
pre-existing

regulations that do so. And insofar as courts merely clarify
and elaborate property entitlements that were previously unclear, they cannot
be said

to have taken an established property right. * * *

For its part, petitioner proposes an unpredictability test.
Quoting Justice Stewart’s concurrence in Hughes v. Washington, 389 U.S. 290,
296

(1967), petitioner argues that a judicial taking consists of
a decision that “ ‘constitutes a sudden change in state law, unpredictable in
terms of

relevant precedents.’ ” The focus of petitioner’s test is
misdirected. What counts is not whether there is precedent for the allegedly
confiscatory

decision, but whether the property right allegedly taken was
established. A “predictability of change” test would cover both too much and
too

little. Too much, because a judicial property decision need
not be predictable, so long as it does not declare that what had been private
property

under established law no longer is. A decision that
clarifies property entitlements (or the lack thereof) that were previously
unclear might be

difficult to predict, but it does not eliminate established

#1320

property rights. And the predictability test covers too
little, because a judicial elimination of established private-property rights
that is

foreshadowed by dicta or even by holdings years in advance
is nonetheless a taking. If, for example, a state court held in one case, to
which the

complaining property owner was not a party, that it had the
power to limit the acreage of privately owned real estate to 100 acres, and
then, in a

second case, applied that principle to declare the
complainant’s 101st acre to be public property, the State would have taken an
acre from the

complainant even though the decision was predictable.

IV

We come at last to petitioner’s takings attack on the
decision below. * * *

Petitioner argues that the Florida Supreme Court took two of
the property rights of the Members by declaring that those rights did not
exist:

the right to accretions, and the right to have littoral
property touch the water (which petitioner distinguishes from the mere right of
access to the

water). Under petitioner’s theory, because no prior Florida
decision had said that the State’s filling of submerged tidal lands could have
the effect

of depriving a littoral owner of contact with the water and
denying him future accretions, the Florida Supreme Court’s judgment in the
present

case abolished those two easements to which littoral
property owners had been entitled. This puts the burden on the wrong party.
There is no

taking unless petitioner can show that, before the Florida
Supreme Court’s decision, littoral-property owners had rights to future
accretions and

contact with the water superior to the State’s right to fill
in its submerged land. Though some may think the question close, in our view
the

showing cannot be made.

Two core principles of Florida property law intersect in
this case. First, the State as owner of the submerged land adjacent to littoral

property has the right to fill that land, so long as it does
not interfere with the rights of the public and the rights of littoral
landowners. See Hayes

v. Bowman, 91 So. 2d 795, 799–800 (Fla. 1957) (right to fill
conveyed by State to private party); State ex rel. Buford v. Tampa, 102 So.
336, 341

(1924) (same). Second, as we described supra, if an avulsion
exposes land seaward of littoral property that had previously been submerged,
that

land belongs to the State even if it interrupts the littoral
owner’s contact with the water. See Bryant, 238 So. 2d, at 837, 838–839. The
issue here

is whether there is an exception to this rule when the State
is the cause of the avulsion. Prior law suggests there is not. In Martin v.
Busch, 112

So. 274 (1927), the Florida Supreme Court held that when the
State drained water from a lakebed belonging to the State, causing land that
was

formerly below the mean high-water line to become dry land,
that land continued to belong to the State. 112 So., at 287; see also Bryant,
supra, at

838–839 (analogizing the situation in Martin to an
avulsion). “ ‘The riparian rights doctrine of accretion and reliction,’ ” the

#1321

Florida Supreme Court later explained, “ ‘does not apply to
such lands.’ ” Bryant, supra, at 839 (quoting Martin, supra, at 112 So., at 288

(Brown, J., concurring)). This is not surprising, as there
can be no accretions to land that no longer abuts the water.

Thus, Florida law as it stood before the decision below
allowed the State to fill in its own seabed, and the resulting sudden exposure
of

previously submerged land was treated like an avulsion for
purposes of ownership. The right to accretions was therefore subordinate to the

State’s right to fill. * * *

The Florida Supreme Court decision before us is consistent
with these background principles of state property law. Cf. Lucas, 505 U.S., at

1028–1029; Scranton v. Wheeler, 179 U.S. 141, 163 (1900). It
did not abolish the Members’ right to future accretions, but merely held that
the

right was not implicated by the beach-restoration project,
because the doctrine of avulsion applied. The Florida Supreme Court’s opinion

describes beach restoration as the reclamation by the State
of the public’s land, just as Martin had described the lake drainage in that
case.

Although the opinion does not cite Martin and is not always
clear on this point, it suffices that its characterization of the littoral
right to accretion

is consistent with Martin and the other relevant principles
of Florida law we have discussed.

* * * The result under Florida law may seem
      counter-intuitive. After all, the Members’ property has been deprived of its
      character (and

value) as oceanfront property by the State’s artificial
creation of an avulsion. Perhaps state-created avulsions ought to be treated
differently from

other avulsions insofar as the property right to accretion
is concerned. But nothing in prior Florida law makes such a distinction, and
Martin

suggests, if it does not indeed hold, the contrary. Even if
there might be different interpretations of Martin and other Florida
property-law cases

that would prevent this arguably odd result, we are not free
to adopt them. The Takings Clause only protects property rights as they are

established under state law, not as they might have been
established or ought to have been established. We cannot say that the Florida
Supreme

Court’s decision eliminated a right of accretion established
under Florida law.

Petitioner also contends that the State took the Members’
littoral right to have their property continually maintain contact with the
water. To

be clear, petitioner does not allege that the State
relocated the property line, as would have happened if the erosion-control line
were landward of

the old mean high-water line (instead of identical to it).
Petitioner argues instead that the Members have a separate right for the
boundary of their

property to be always the mean high-water line. Petitioner
points to dicta in [ Board of Trustees of Internal Improvement Trust Fund v.
Sand Key

Assocs., Ltd. , 512 So.2d 934 (Fla. 1 987)] that refers to
“the right to have the property’s contact with the water remain intact,” 512
So. 2d, at 936.

Even there, the right was included in the

#1322

definition of the right to access, ibid., which is
consistent with the Florida Supreme Court’s later description that “there is no
independent right of

contact with the water” but it “exists to preserve the
upland owner’s core littoral right of access to the water.” Petitioner’s
expansive

interpretation of the dictum in Sand Key would cause it to
contradict the clear Florida law governing avulsion. One cannot say that the
Florida

Supreme Court contravened established property law by
rejecting it.

V

Because the Florida Supreme Court’s decision did not
contravene the established property rights of petitioner’s Members, Florida has
not

violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The judgment
of the Florida Supreme Court is therefore affirmed.

It is so ordered.

■
JUSTICE STEVENS took no part in the decision of this case.

■
JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR joins, concurring in part and
concurring in the judgment. The Court’s analysis of the

principles that control ownership of the land in question,
and of the rights of petitioner’s members as adjacent owners, is correct in my
view,

leading to my joining Parts I, IV, and V of the Court’s
opinion. As Justice Breyer observes, however, this case does not require the
Court to

determine whether, or when, a judicial decision determining
the rights of property owners can violate the Takings Clause of the Fifth

Amendment of the United States Constitution. * * *

■
JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins, concurring in part and
concurring in the judgment. I agree that no unconstitutional taking

of property occurred in this case, and I therefore join
Parts I, IV, and V of today’s opinion. I cannot join Parts II and III, however,
for in those

Parts the plurality unnecessarily addresses questions of
constitutional law that are better left for another day.

* * * [I]f we were to express our views on these questions,
      we would invite a host of federal takings claims without the mature

consideration of potential procedural or substantive legal
principles that might limit federal interference in matters that are primarily
the subject

of state law. Property owners litigate many thousands of
cases involving state property law in state courts each year. Each state-court
property

decision may further affect numerous nonparty property
owners as well. Losing parties in many state-court cases may well believe that
erroneous

judicial decisions have deprived them of property rights
they previously held and may consequently bring federal takings claims. And a
glance at

Part IV makes clear that such cases can involve state
property law issues of considerable complexity. Hence, the approach the
plurality would

take today threatens to open the federal court doors to
constitutional review of many, perhaps large numbers of, state-law cases in an
area of law

familiar to state, but not federal, judges. And the failure
of that approach to set forth procedural limitations or canons of deference
would create

#1323

the distinct possibility that federal judges would play a
major role in the shaping of a matter of significant state interest—state
property law.

The plurality criticizes me for my cautious approach, and
states that I “cannot decide that petitioner’s claim fails without first
deciding what

a valid claim would consist of.” But, of course, courts
frequently find it possible to resolve cases—even those raising constitutional
questions—

without specifying the precise standard under which a party
wins or loses. That is simply what I would do here.

In the past, Members of this Court have warned us that, when
faced with difficult constitutional questions, we should “confine ourselves to

deciding only what is necessary to the disposition of the
immediate case.” Whitehouse v. Illinois Central R. Co., 349 U.S. 366, 373
(1955). I heed

this advice here. There is no need now to decide more than
what the Court decides in Parts IV and V, namely, that the Florida Supreme
Court’s

decision in this case did not amount to a “judicial taking.”

Benjamin Barros, The Complexities of Judicial Takings, 45 U. Rich. L. Rev. 903
( 2011 );

Protection_ : Judicial

Takings: A Medley of Misconceptions, 61 Syracuse L. Rev. 203
, 206 – 10 ( 2011 ). Was it possible to decide the case without determining
whether there

can be such a thing as a judicial taking? One possibility
would be to ask whether a taking would have occurred if the Florida legislature
(or executive)

had by statute or regulation abrogated the right to future
accretions and the right to have littoral property touch the water as part of a
beach restoration

program. Assume the statute provides that construction of
the new beach will eliminate any right to future accretion (and liability for
future erosion). A

littoral owner whose property abuts the new beach would lose
physical contact with the water, but would not lose any square footage of
property (the

boundary line would remain unchanged) and would still have
the right of access to the water and an unobstructed view of the water. How
would a

takings claim challenging such a statute be assessed under
_Loretto_? Under _Lucas_? Under the ad hoc test of either _Pennsylvania Coal_
or _Penn Central_? If

the answer is that the legislature would not have committed
a taking under any of these tests, then could it possibly be said that the
Florida Supreme

Court had committed a taking in rendering a judicial
judgment saying the elimination of these asserted rights did not contradict
Florida property law?

2 .Does _Stop the Beach_ strengthen or weaken the autonomy
of states in determining the content of property law? On the one hand, the
opinion

states in Part I that the content of property is determined
by state law and can differ from one state to another. And Part IV says that
established

principles of state property law are immune from challenge
as judicial

```



1324



```

takings, even if they appear to be “counter-intuitive” or
unjust. Thus, the Court holds that littoral owners whose property is cut off
from direct contact

with the water by a public beach project have no judicial
takings claim, because prior Florida decisions had given the state the power to
make “artificial

avulsions” on submerged public land. On the other hand,
Justice Scalia insists that in order to determine whether a judicial taking has
occurred, federal

courts must determine the content of state property law
independently, without deferring to the judgment of the state judiciary in the
challenged

decision. In response to Justice Breyer’s plea for “canons
of deference” that would prevent federal courts from intruding into matters of
state property

law, Justice Scalia responds that federal courts must
exercise independent judgment about state property law in order to give effect
to the constitutional

protection in the Takings Clause. Given that Parts I and IV
are opinions of the Court, whereas the discussion about the need to exercise
independent

judgment is a plurality opinion as to which the Court was
evenly divided, can it be argued that _Stop the Beach_ actually enhances state
autonomy over

property rights?

3 .In striking the balance between protecting federal
constitutional rights and preserving state court freedom in interpreting state
law, the Supreme

Court has most often said that it will defer to state court
interpretations of state law as long as they have a “fair or substantial
basis.” Justice Scalia in

_Stop the Beach_ would adopt a different approach for
judicial takings claims, asking whether the state court has eliminated an
“established property

right.” Federal courts would exercise independent judgment
in making this inquiry. But he argues in footnote 9 that the standard has
deference built into

it: if there is “doubt about the existence” of a right then
it is not “established,” and hence the state court is entitled to clarify the
law without federal

second-guessing. Who has the better view here? For competing
perspectives, see Henry Paul Monaghan, Supreme Court Review of State-Court

Determinations of State Law in Constitutional Cases, 103
Colum. L. Rev. 1919 ( 2003 ) (federal courts must exercise independent judgment
as to state

law issues that are “logically antecedent” to a claim of
federal constitutional right); E. Brantley Webb, How to Review State Court
Determination of

State Law Antecedent to Federal Rights, 120 Yale L.J. 1192 (
2011 ) (the fair or substantial basis standard has been applied most frequently
by the

Supreme Court in a variety of contexts and strikes the best
balance between enforcement of federal rights and protection of state
autonomy).

4 .Can federal courts determine if a state court has
eliminated an “established property right” without having some
conception—grounded in

federal constitutional law—about what counts as a property
right? In particular, do judicial takings claims implicate the same “conceptual
severance” or

“numerator/denominator” problems that have vexed regulatory
takings law more generally? Suppose the Court in _Stop the Beach_ had concluded
that the

right to future accretions was firmly established in Florida
property law, and that the state supreme court had eliminated this right. Would
this not then

present the further question whether the right to future
accretion was itself a “property right” as opposed to merely one

```



1325



```

incident of property—one stick in the bundle of rights that
belong to riparian or littoral owners? If the right to future accretion is the
“property right,”

then its elimination sounds like a taking. But if the
relevant denominator is the “whole parcel” owned by the littoral owner, then
elimination of future

accretions only removes one portion of the total property
right, and it would be much less likely to be regarded as a taking. Given all
the ink that has

been spilled over this issue, in decisions like _Penn
Central_ , _Palazzolo_ , and _Tahoe-Sierra_ , are you surprised that Justice
Scalia makes no mention of it? Is

there any justification for adopting a different conception
of the relevant unit of property or denominator for judicial takings purposes,
as opposed to

more conventional regulatory takings purposes involving
legislative or executive action?

5 .Although this case is known for the Court’s struggle with
the possibility of judicial takings, notice that it raises issues from earlier
in our study

of property, from accession to the _numerus clausus_. Does
the idea of a legal notion of a thing and courts’ (usual) deference to
legislatures in altering the

list of property rights counsel against—or for—policing by
federal courts for possible judicial takings?

and shopping centers. In this way it was hoped that the
cycle of decay of the area could be controlled and the birth of future slums
prevented”). Had the public use in _Berman_ been defined

more narrowly, it would have been difficult to justify the
taking of the plaintiff’s nonblighted department store.

(^16) Nor do our cases support Justice O’CONNOR’s novel
theory that the government may only take property and transfer it to private
parties when the initial taking eliminates some

“harmful property use.” There was nothing “harmful” about
the nonblighted department store at issue in Berman, 348 U.S. 26 ; see also n.
13 , supra; nothing “harmful” about the lands at issue

in the mining and agriculture cases, see, e.g., Strickley,
200 U.S. 527 ; and certainly nothing “harmful” about the trade secrets owned by
the pesticide manufacturers in _Monsanto,_ 467 U.S.

986. In each case, the public purpose we upheld depended on
     a private party’s _future_ use of the concededly nonharmful property that was
     taken. By focusing on a property’s future use, as

opposed to its past use, our cases are faithful to the text
of the Takings Clause. See U.S. Const., Amdt. 5. (“[N]or shall private property
be taken for public use, without just compensation”).

---

(^17) Courts have viewed such aberrations with a skeptical
eye. See, e.g., 99 Cents Only Stores v. Lancaster Redevelopment Agency, 237
F.Supp. 2 d 1123 (C.D. Cal. 2001 ); cf. Cincinnati v.

Vester, 281 U.S. 439 , 448 ( 1930 ) (taking invalid under
state eminent domain statute for lack of a reasoned explanation). These types
of takings may also implicate other constitutional

guarantees. See Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S.
562 ( 2000 ) ( _per curiam_ ).

(^18) Cf. Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 277
U.S. 218 , 223 ( 1928 ) (Holmes, J., dissenting) (“The power to tax is not the
power to destroy while this Court sits”).

(^22) See, e.g., County of Wayne v. Hathcock, 684 N.W. 2 d
765 (Mich. 2004 ).

(^23) Under California law, for instance, a city may only
take land for economic development purposes in blighted areas. Cal. Health
& Safety Code Ann. §§ 33030 – 33037 (West 1997 ).

See, e.g., Redevelopment Agency of Chula Vista v. Rados
Bros., 115 Cal.Rptr. 2 d 234 (Cal. Ct. App. 2001 ).

(^24) For example, some argue that the need for eminent
domain has been greatly exaggerated because private developers can use numerous
techniques, including secret negotiations or

precommitment strategies, to overcome holdout problems and
assemble lands for genuinely profitable projects. See Brief for Jane Jacobs as
_Amicus Curiae_ 13 – 15 ; see also Brief for John

Norquist as _Amicus Curiae_. Others argue to the contrary,
urging that the need for eminent domain is especially great with regard to
older, small cities like New London, where centuries of

development have created an extreme overdivision of land and
thus a real market impediment to land assembly. See Brief for Connecticut
Conference for Municipalities et al. as _Amici Curiae_

13 , 21 ; see also Brief for National League of Cities et
al. as _Amici Curiae_.

(^12) The permanence and absolute exclusivity of a physical
occupation distinguish it from temporary limitations on the right to exclude.
Not every physical _invasion_ is a taking. As

_PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins_ , 447 U.S. 74 ( 1980
); _Kaiser Aetna v. United States_ , 444 U.S. 164 ( 1979 ), and the
intermittent flooding cases reveal, such temporary limitations are

subject to a more complex balancing process to determine
whether they are a taking. The rationale is evident: they do not absolutely
dispossess the owner of his rights to use, and exclude

others from, his property.

The dissent objects that the distinction between a permanent
physical occupation and a temporary invasion will not always be clear. This
objection is overstated, and in any event is

irrelevant to the critical point that a permanent physical
occupation _is_ unquestionably a taking. In the antitrust area, similarly, this
Court has not declined to apply a _per se_ rule simply because

a court must, at the boundary of the rule, apply the rule of
reason and engage in a more complex balancing analysis.

(^16) It is constitutionally irrelevant whether appellant
(or her predecessor in title) had previously occupied this space, since a
“landowner owns at least as much of the space above the

ground as he can occupy or use in connection with the land.”
United States v. Causby, supra, at 264. The dissent asserts that a taking of
about one-eighth of a cubic foot of space is not of

constitutional significance. The assertion appears to be
factually incorrect, since it ignores the two large silver boxes that appellant
identified as part of the installation. Although the record

does not reveal their size, appellant states that they are
approximately 18 ′′ × 12 ′′ × 6 ′′, Brief for Appellant 6 n.*, and appellees do
not dispute this statement. The displaced volume, then, is in

excess of 1 1 / 2 cubic feet. In any event, these facts are
not critical: whether the installation is a taking does not depend on whether
the volume of space it occupies is bigger than a breadbox.

(^17) It is true that the landlord could avoid the
requirements of § 828 by ceasing to rent the building to tenants. But a
landlord’s ability to rent his property may not be conditioned on his

forfeiting the right to compensation for a physical
occupation.

(^19) If § 828 required landlords to provide cable
installation if a tenant so desires, the statute might present a different
question from the question before us, since the landlord would own

the installation. Ownership would give the landlord rights
to the placement, manner, use, and possibly the disposition of the
installation. The fact of ownership is, contrary to the dissent, not

simply “incidental”; it would give a landlord (rather than a
CATV company) full authority over the installation except only as government
specifically limited that authority. The _landlord_

would decide how to comply with applicable government
regulations concerning CATV and therefore could minimize the physical,
esthetic, and other effects of the installation. Moreover, if

the landlord wished to repair, demolish, or construct in the
area of the building where the installation is located, he need not incur the
burden of obtaining the CATV company’s cooperation in

moving the cable. In this case, by contrast, appellant
suffered injury that might have been obviated if she had owned the cable and
could exercise control over its installation. The drilling and

stapling that accompanied installation apparently caused
physical damage to appellant’s building. App. 83 , 95 – 96 , 104. Appellant,
who resides in her building, further testified that the cable

installation is “ugly.” Id., at 99. Although § 828 provides
that a landlord may require “reasonable” conditions that are “necessary” to
protect the appearance of the premises and may seek

indemnity for damage, these provisions are somewhat limited.
Even if the provisions are effective, the inconvenience to the landlord of
initiating the repairs remains a cognizable burden.

(^7) Regrettably, the rhetorical force of our “deprivation
of all economically feasible use” rule is greater than its precision, since the
rule does not make clear the “property interest” against

which the loss of value is to be measured. When, for
example, a regulation requires a developer to leave 90 % of a rural tract in
its natural state, it is unclear whether we would analyze the

situation as one in which the owner has been deprived of all
economically beneficial use of the burdened portion of the tract, or as one in
which the owner has suffered a mere diminution in

value of the tract as a whole. (For an extreme—and, we
think, unsupportable—view of the relevant calculus, see Penn Central
Transportation Co. v. New York City, 366 N.E. 2 d 1271 , 1276 –

1277 (N.Y. 1977 ), aff’d, 438 U.S. 104 ( 1978 ), where the
state court examined the diminution in a particular parcel’s value produced by
a municipal ordinance in light of total value of the

takings claimant’s other holdings in the vicinity.)
Unsurprisingly, this uncertainty regarding the composition of the denominator
in our “deprivation” fraction has produced inconsistent

pronouncements by the Court. Compare Pennsylvania Coal Co.
v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 , 414 ( 1922 ) (law restricting subsurface extraction of
coal held to effect a taking), with Keystone

Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470 , 497 –
502 ( 1987 ) (nearly identical law held not to effect a taking); see also id.,
at 515 – 520 (REHNQUIST, C.J., dissenting); Rose,

_Mahon_ Reconstructed: Why the Takings Issue is Still a
Muddle, 57 S.Cal.L.Rev. 561 , 566 – 569 ( 1984 ). The answer to this difficult
question may lie in how the owner’s reasonable

expectations have been shaped by the State’s law of
property— _i.e.,_ whether and to what degree the State’s law has accorded legal
recognition and protection to the particular interest in land

with respect to which the takings claimant alleges a
diminution in (or elimination of) value. In any event, we avoid this difficulty
in the present case, since the “interest in land” that Lucas has

pleaded (a fee simple interest) is an estate with a rich
tradition of protection at common law, and since the South Carolina Court of
Common Pleas found that the Beachfront Management Act

left each of Lucas’s beachfront lots without economic value.

(^16) The principal “otherwise” that we have in mind is
litigation absolving the State (or private parties) of liability for the
destruction of “real and personal property, in cases of actual

necessity, to prevent the spreading of a fire” or to
forestall other grave threats to the lives and property of others. Bowditch v.
Boston, 101 U.S. 16 , 18 – 19 ( 1880 ); see United States v. Pacific

R., Co., 120 U.S. 227 , 238 – 239 ( 1887 ).

(^18) Justice BLACKMUN decries our reliance on background
nuisance principles at least in part because he believes those principles to be
as manipulable as we find the “harm

prevention”/“benefit conferral” dichotomy. There is no doubt
some leeway in a court’s interpretation of what existing state law permits—but
not remotely as much, we think, as in a legislative

crafting of the reasons for its confiscatory regulation. We
stress that an affirmative decree eliminating all economically beneficial uses
may be defended only if an _objectively reasonable

application_ of relevant precedents would exclude those
beneficial uses in the circumstances in which the land is presently found.

(^2) We assume, as the parties agree we should, that in this
case the erosion-control line is the pre-existing mean high-water line. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 11 – 12. Respondents concede that, if the

erosion-control line were established landward of that, the
State would have taken property. Brief for Respondent Department et al. 15 ;
Brief for Respondent Walton County et al. 6.

(^3) The Florida Supreme Court seemingly took the question
to refer to constitutionality under the Florida Constitution, which contains a
clause similar to the Takings Clause of the Federal

Constitution. Compare Fla. Const., Art. X, § 6 , cl. (a),
with U.S. Const., Amdt. 5.

(^4) We ordinarily do not consider an issue first presented
to a state court in a petition for rehearing if the state court did not address
it. See Adams v. Robertson, 520 U.S. 83 , 89 , n. 3

( 1997 ) (per curiam). But where the state-court decision
itself is claimed to constitute a violation of federal law, the state court’s
refusal to address that claim put forward in a petition for

rehearing will not bar our review. See Brinkerhoff-Faris
Trust & Sav. Co. v. Hill, 281 U.S. 673 , 677 – 678 ( 1930 ).

(^9) JUSTICE BREYER complains that we do not set forth
“procedural limitations or canons of deference” to restrict federal-court
review of state-court property decisions. * * * The test we

have adopted, however (deprivation of an _established_
property right), contains within itself a considerable degree of deference to
state courts. A property right is not established if there is

doubt about its existence; and when there is doubt we do not
make our own assessment but accept the determination of the state court.
