If you need to start before syllabus arrives:
1. Review **past outlines** in `07_OUTLINE/` to identify major topics
2. Skim **table of contents** of core textbook (`02_SOURCES/core/`)
3. Parse **past exams** to identify high-frequency topics (see `02_SOURCES/exams_raw/`)
4. Create preliminary topic list based on common Property law sequence:
   - Acquisition of Property (possession, adverse possession, gifts)
   - Estates & Future Interests
   - Concurrent Ownership
   - Landlord-Tenant
   - Servitudes (easements, covenants, equitable servitudes)
   - Land Use (zoning, takings)
   - Sales & Transfers
