## CORE DOCTRINE

### Rule statements (copy-ready)

**Adverse possession (big idea)**: A possessor can acquire legal title to land by possessing it in the legally required way for the statutory period, thereby cutting off the record owner’s ejectment action and quieting title in the possessor.

**Baseline elements (A-E-H-C + time)**: Adverse possession usually requires possession that is:
- **A**ctual (use/control as an owner would)
- **E**xclusive (not shared with the true owner/the public in a way inconsistent with ownership)
- **O&N**: **O**pen and **n**otorious (sufficient to give notice—actual or constructive)
- **H**ostile/adverse (without permission; under a “claim of right” as defined by the jurisdiction)
- **C**ontinuous for the statutory period (as the property is ordinarily used)
- **Time**: for the statutorily required period (often 10+ years, varies by state)

**Burden**: Many courts describe adverse possession as needing to be proved by **clear and convincing evidence** (check your jurisdiction/case).

**Permission defeats AP**: If the record owner gave permission (license/lease), possession is not “hostile” unless and until the possessor clearly repudiates permission and the owner has notice.

**Tacking**: Successive possessors can usually add (“tack”) their time to satisfy the statutory period if there is **privity** (typically a voluntary transfer like a deed) and no gap that breaks continuity.

**Disabilities / tolling**: Many statutes toll the limitations period if the record owner had a legally recognized disability **at the start of the adverse possession** (details vary; typically you can’t stack later-arising disabilities).

### Elements breakdown (how professors test it)

**1) Actual**
- Ask: “What would a typical owner of this kind of property do?”
- Wild/undeveloped land: actual possession can be shown by acts like boundary marking, timber management, and controlled use consistent with “ownership” of that type of tract.
- Improved/residential: fences, landscaping, building/maintenance, paying utilities, etc. usually matter more.

**2) Exclusive**
- The possessor must act like the **sole** owner (no shared possession with the record owner).
- Occasional trespasses by others don’t necessarily defeat exclusivity if the possessor generally controls the land.

**3) Open & notorious**
- The use must be visible enough that a reasonably attentive owner would be on notice.
- Boundary marking, conspicuous improvements, obvious regular use: all strengthen this element.

**4) Hostile/adverse (“claim of right”)**
Different jurisdictions define this differently; be ready to name the test the court is using:
- **Objective test (often called the “Connecticut rule”)**: hostility = possession **without permission**; the possessor’s subjective state of mind usually doesn’t matter.
- **Good-faith requirement (sometimes associated with an “Iowa/Carpenter” style approach)**: claim of right may require an honest belief the possessor owns the land.
- **Bad-faith requirement (often called the “Maine rule”)**: requires intent to take land you know isn’t yours (less common today).

**5) Continuous for the statutory period**
- “Continuous” means continuous **as owners of that type of property typically use it**, not literal 24/7 presence.
- Seasonal properties (e.g., summer cabins) can satisfy continuity if used in the normal seasonal pattern and the improvements remain.

**6) Time / statutory period**
- Statutory period varies; for today’s purposes, be ready to state it for the jurisdiction in the case.
- The “clock” can be stopped by things like the record owner’s suit, re-entry, or a break in possession (varies by doctrine).

### Common traps (what gets you cold-called into a corner)

- **Saying “trespass = adverse possession”**: AP is a specific package of elements + time, often with an elevated burden.
- **Forgetting permission**: If it started permissive, you need repudiation + notice to convert to hostile.
- **Treating continuity as literal**: the “continuous” analysis depends on the property’s character (seasonal use can count).
- **Thinking taxes alone win**: tax payment can help (jurisdiction-specific), but it rarely substitutes for possession.
- **Ignoring land type**: what counts as “actual” for a woodlot differs from a suburban strip.

## EXPECTED PROFESSOR QUESTIONS (Q→A)

**Q: Is adverse possession a “way of getting title,” or just a statute of limitations rule?**

**A:** Both. Many cases describe AP as the statute of limitations on ejectment/quiet title operating so that, once the period runs with the required possession, the record owner’s claim is barred and the possessor’s title is quieted.

---

**Q: Why do we require open and notorious possession?**

**A:** Notice + fairness. If the true owner can’t reasonably detect the invasion, it’s harder to justify cutting off the owner’s rights.

---

**Q: What does “hostile” mean—do you have to be a bad actor?**

**A:** Not necessarily. In many jurisdictions hostility just means “without permission.” In others, the court uses a subjective claim-of-right test (good faith or bad faith). The key exam move is to identify which test the jurisdiction uses and apply it.

---

**Q: Why allow tacking—doesn’t it let people launder trespass into title?**

**A:** Tacking reflects that the owner had continuous notice-risk across transfers, and it prevents resetting the clock every time possession changes hands in an orderly way (privity). It also avoids formalism when the land use is continuous in substance.

## CASE BRIEFS (Quick Reference)

### Scott v. Anderson-Tully Co. (Miss. Ct. App. 2015)

- **Theme**: Wild/undeveloped land + what counts as “acts of ownership.”
- **Key moves**: Boundary marking (recognizable paint), periodic timber harvesting/management, and granting hunting rights can support actual + open/notorious possession for wild land.
- **Useful language to remember**: courts often look for the possessor to “stake” an ownership claim in a way that puts the owner on notice (don’t quote; paraphrase the idea).
- **Exam use**: If land is unimproved, list the kinds of acts that can still be sufficiently “owner-like.”

### Carpenter v. Ruperto (Iowa 1982)

- **Theme**: Hostility/claim-of-right framed as a **good faith** requirement.
- **Key point**: If the jurisdiction requires good faith, knowledge that the land is not yours can defeat “claim of right,” even with decades of yard-like use.
- **Exam use**: Use this to contrast with the objective “no-permission” approach.

### Howard v. Kunto (Wash. Ct. App. 1970)

- **Theme**: Continuity + tacking in a deed-misdescription / seasonal-use setting.
- **Holdings to take away**:
  - Seasonal occupancy can still be “continuous” if it matches normal use for that kind of property.
  - Tacking is allowed when there is privity (typical vehicle: deed + transfer of possession), even if the deed description is mistaken and the occupied parcel is contiguous.

### Songbyrd, Inc. v. Estate of Grossman (N.D.N.Y. 1998)

- **Theme**: Statute of limitations for recovery of chattels (conversion/replevin) and how accrual rules can resemble/contrast with adverse possession logic.
- **Key point**: The demand-and-refusal accrual rule is associated with good-faith purchasers; when the defendant is the alleged wrongdoer exercising dominion inconsistent with the owner’s rights, accrual can run from the conversion.
- **Exam use**: Helps explain why “timing rules” can protect reliance and quiet disputes, even when equities feel mixed.

---

## POLICY / THEORY

Use whichever justification the professor is pushing in the moment (and note the counter):

- **Quieting title / certainty**: after long, visible possession, the law prefers stability over reopening old disputes.
- **Evidentiary**: old claims get hard to prove; time improves accuracy by forcing disputes earlier.
- **Reliance / investment**: the possessor may invest in the property; the owner’s prolonged inaction increases the possessor’s reliance.
- **Sleeping owner / incentives**: encourages owners to monitor/enforce boundaries.
- **Fairness counterpoint**: can look like legalized theft, especially where the possessor knowingly encroaches or where owners have barriers to monitoring.

---

## QUICK HYPOS

1) **Suburban strip**: A builds a fence 3 feet over the line for 12 years. A honestly thinks it’s the line. Result depends on hostility test (objective vs good-faith vs bad-faith) + open/continuous/exclusive.

2) **Summer cabin**: Family uses a beach house only May–Aug each year for 11 years; maintains improvements year-round. Ask whether that is “continuous” for this kind of property and whether tacking is needed.

3) **Timberland**: Company repaints boundary marks every few years, harvests timber twice a decade, and leases hunting rights. Ask whether those acts are enough for “actual” possession of wild land and whether they are open/notorious.

4) **Permission**: Owner tells Neighbor “you can garden here.” After 10 years, Neighbor claims AP. Identify the problem (permission) and what would be needed to repudiate permissive use.

---

## CONNECTION TO PRIOR CLASSES

- **Relativity of title / sequential possession**: AP is another way possession can become legally protected against the world, but only after time + notice-like elements.
- **Rules vs. standards**: The element list looks like a rule, but its application (what counts as “actual,” “open,” “continuous”) is highly standard-like and property-type dependent.
