## ASSIGNMENT MAP (DON'T READ THE WRONG PAGES)

**CB 432–440** = Continuous trespasses / encroachments
- Core case: **_Golden Press v. Rylands_** (encroachment; balance of hardships; mandatory injunction)

**CB 440–442** = Theory: Ex ante vs. ex post perspectives on exclusion
- Reading note on efficiency justifications for property rules

**CB 335–343** = Criminal enforcement of exclusion
- Core case: **_State v. Shack_** (limits on exclusion when public policies override)

**CB 356–369** = Self-help enforcement
- Core case: **_Berg v. Wiley_** (wrongful eviction; damages for self-help)

---

## CORE DOCTRINE

### Rule statements (copy-ready)

**Continuous trespass (encroachment)**: A **permanent physical intrusion** onto neighboring land (e.g., building overhang, foundation, wall). Distinguished from repeated trespasses (series of acts) because the violation is ongoing.

**Remedies for encroachment**:
- **Mandatory injunction** (removal): Available when harm is significant and balance of hardships favors plaintiff.
- **Damages** (permanent): If removal would cause disproportionate hardship to defendant, court may award damages instead (sometimes called "forced sale" or "balancing of hardships").

**Ex ante vs. ex post efficiency**:
- **Ex ante**: Strong exclusion rights encourage efficient investment and trade (clear boundaries reduce negotiation costs).
- **Ex post**: Once structures exist, flexibility (damages rather than removal) may maximize total value and avoid waste.

**Criminal trespass**: Entry onto land after warning to stay off (or refusal to leave). Enforces exclusion through criminal sanctions, but subject to limits when public policy overrides.

**Self-help eviction**: Common law generally **prohibits forcible self-help** when legal remedies are available. Landlord who wrongfully evicts tenant without legal process is liable for damages.

---

### What to be ready to say out loud (cold-call safe)

**1) Continuous vs repeated trespass**
- **Continuous** = one structure/intrusion that stays (encroachment).
- **Repeated** = series of separate acts (e.g., dogs running onto land).

**2) Golden Press's punchline**
- Courts **balance hardships** in deciding whether to order removal of encroachment; if removal would be grossly disproportionate to harm, may award damages instead.

**3) Shack's punchline**
- Even landowners with broad exclusion rights **cannot exclude** when doing so violates public policy (e.g., preventing migrant workers from accessing legal/medical services).

**4) Berg's punchline**
- **Self-help is disfavored**; landlords must use legal process to evict even when tenant is in default. Wrongful lockout = damages.

---

## EXPECTED PROFESSOR QUESTIONS (Q→A)

**Q:** Why should courts ever deny a mandatory injunction for encroachment? Isn't property about absolute exclusion?

**A:** Two answers:
1. **Equity tradition**: Courts balance hardships to avoid waste (e.g., tearing down $200k structure to remedy $5k harm).
2. **Ex post efficiency**: Once investments are made, forcing removal may destroy value that negotiation could preserve.

---

**Q:** If damages can substitute for removal, doesn't that undermine property rights?

**A:** Yes, to some extent — it's a "forced sale" where defendant buys an easement without consent. Tension between **ex ante** clarity (strong exclusion) and **ex post** flexibility (avoiding destruction of value).

---

**Q:** Should self-help be allowed when the tenant is clearly in the wrong?

**A:** Policy arguments both ways:
- **For self-help**: Reduces litigation costs; tenant breached, so why protect them?
- **Against self-help**: Risk of abuse, mistake, and violence. Legal process ensures due process and prevents escalation.

---

**Q:** How does _State v. Shack_ square with the right to exclude being fundamental?

**A:** The right to exclude is **not absolute**; it's subject to limits imposed by statute, regulation, or public policy. _Shack_ reflects that property rights exist within a social/legal context that can override exclusion when necessary.

## CASE BRIEFS (Quick Reference)

### _Golden Press, Inc. v. Rylands_ (Colo. 1951)

- **Setup**: Defendant's building foundation encroaches onto plaintiff's land; plaintiff seeks mandatory injunction to remove.
- **Holding (for this class)**: Court denies mandatory injunction; awards damages instead based on **balance of hardships**.
- **Reasoning themes to remember**:
  - Mandatory injunction appropriate when harm is substantial and removal not grossly disproportionate.
  - Here: removal would cost $70k+ and destroy building; harm to plaintiff minimal.
  - Court essentially forces a sale of the small strip at fair value.
- **Professor Lee angle**: Classic ex ante/ex post tension — strong rules encourage care ex ante, but flexibility ex post avoids waste.

### _State v. Shack_ (N.J. 1971)

- **Setup**: Migrant camp operator tries to exclude legal/medical services providers from entering camp to meet with workers.
- **Holding (for this class)**: Trespass statute does not apply; landowner cannot exclude when doing so violates public policy protecting migrant workers' rights.
- **Reasoning themes to remember**:
  - Property rights are not absolute; they exist within framework of law and public policy.
  - Exclusion cannot be used to deny fundamental rights (access to legal counsel, medical care).
  - Distinguishes between commercial/trespass entry vs. humanitarian/legal access.
- **Exam/class use**: Great example of **limits on exclusion**; watch for policy arguments about balancing property rights vs. human rights.

### _Berg v. Wiley_ (Minn. 1978)

- **Setup**: Landlord changes locks while tenant temporarily out; claims tenant defaulted on lease.
- **Holding (for this class)**: Self-help eviction prohibited; landlord must use legal process. Wrongful lockout = damages.
- **What to memorize**:
  - **Self-help disfavored**: Even when tenant arguably in default, landlord cannot forcibly evict without court process.
  - **Damages**: Tenant entitled to damages for wrongful eviction (lost profits, emotional distress, etc.).
  - **Policy**: Legal process prevents mistakes, abuse, and violence.

## POLICY / THEORY

### Ex Ante vs. Ex Post Efficiency

**Ex ante perspective**:
- Strong property rights (clear exclusion, mandatory injunctions) encourage:
  - **Efficient investment** (owners invest knowing boundaries protected)
  - **Clear signals** for negotiation (buyers/sellers know what they're getting)
  - **Deterrence** of boundary violations (encroachers bear full cost)

**Ex post perspective**:
- Once investments made, flexibility (damages, balancing hardships) may:
  - **Avoid waste** (e.g., tearing down building for minor encroachment)
  - **Maximize total value** (structure worth more standing than removed)
  - **Enable efficient outcomes** when transaction costs prevent negotiation

**Tension**: Strong rules ex ante vs. flexible standards ex post. Property law tries to balance both.

---

### Criminal vs. Civil Enforcement

- **Civil**: Owner uses tort law (trespass) to recover damages or get injunction.
- **Criminal**: State prosecutes trespasser; sanctions include fines, jail.
- **Why both?**: Civil protects owner's private interest; criminal protects public interest in order/deterrence.
- **Limits**: Criminal trespass subject to constitutional limits, public policy exceptions (_Shack_).

---

### Self-Help vs. Legal Process

- **Self-help advantages**: Fast, cheap, avoids litigation.
- **Self-help risks**: Mistake (evicting tenant who's not in default), abuse (force, violence), escalation.
- **Modern trend**: Strong disfavor of self-help when legal remedies available (_Berg_).

---

## QUICK HYPOS

1) **Foundation encroachment**: Neighbor's foundation extends 6 inches onto your land; discovered during survey 10 years after built. Removal would cost $150k; land value affected $2k. Should court order removal or award damages?

2) **HVAC overhang**: Air conditioning unit extends 2 feet over property line; creates noise/heat for neighbor. Removal costs $5k; alternative location available. Injunction or damages?

3) **Lockout during pandemic**: Landlord locks out tenant during COVID-19 for non-payment; eviction moratorium in place. Wrongful eviction? What damages?

4) **Exclusion of union organizers**: Farm owner excludes union organizers from property; workers live on-site. Does _Shack_ principle apply, or can owner exclude?

---

## CONNECTION TO PRIOR CLASSES

- **Encroachment vs. repeated trespass**: Building on remedies discussion from _Baker_ (Class 6).
- **Balancing of hardships**: Similar to nuisance doctrine (will see later) — when do courts deny injunction?
- **Limits on exclusion**: Continues theme from trespass; right to exclude not absolute.

## SEARCH TERMS

- continuous trespass encroachment mandatory injunction balance of hardships Golden Press
- ex ante ex post efficiency property rights investment
- criminal trespass public policy Shack limits on exclusion
- self-help eviction wrongful lockout Berg damages legal process

## NOTES FOR COLD CALL

**Key themes to emphasize**:
1. **Continuous trespass** = structural/permanent encroachment (not series of acts)
2. **Balance of hardships** in equity = when removal grossly disproportionate, award damages instead
3. **Ex ante/ex post tension** = strong rules before vs. flexible standards after
4. **Limits on exclusion** = property rights subject to public policy, constitutional limits
5. **Self-help disfavored** = use legal process, not force

**Watch for**:
- Professor Lee likely to ask about efficiency justifications (ex ante/ex post)
- Policy debate on forced sales (damages for encroachment) vs. absolute exclusion
- Comparison between _Shack_ (public policy override) and general exclusion principles
