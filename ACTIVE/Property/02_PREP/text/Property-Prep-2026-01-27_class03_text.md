## CORE DOCTRINE

### Rule statements (copy-ready)

**Ad coelum doctrine (traditional rule)**: *Cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum et ad inferos* — "Whoever owns the soil owns also to the sky and to the depths." Landowner owns everything above and below the surface to infinite extent (traditional common law).

**Modern ad coelum (limited rule)**: Landowner owns airspace/subsurface only to the extent they can make **actual or beneficial use** of it. Airspace trespass requires interference with actual use or enjoyment; overflights at navigable altitude are not trespasses. *United States v. Causby*, 328 U.S. 256 (1946).

**Subsurface rights**: Landowner owns minerals/oil/gas beneath surface, but neighboring drilling that captures migrating substances is permitted (rule of capture applies to fugitive resources). Ownership is in place (*in situ*) but subject to capture by others if resource migrates.

---

**Finder's rights (sequential possession)**: A finder of personal property has title **good against all the world except** (1) the **true owner**, or (2) a **prior possessor**. Possession is title as against anyone who cannot show prior/superior right. *Armory v. Delamirie*, 93 Eng. Rep. 664 (K.B. 1722).

**Found property categories**:
1. **Abandoned**: Owner voluntarily relinquishes all rights. First finder becomes true owner (no superior claim remains).
2. **Lost**: Owner unintentionally parts with possession. Finder beats everyone except true owner.
3. **Mislaid**: Owner intentionally places property somewhere and forgets. **Possessor of premises** (not finder) holds for true owner (reasoning: owner more likely to return to where they left it).
4. **Treasure trove** (archaic): Hidden gold/silver/currency from long ago. Traditionally belongs to finder (mostly obsolete).

**Landowner vs. finder**:
- **Attached/embedded objects**: Landowner wins (constructive possession of things attached to land).
- **Buried/underground objects**: Landowner wins (exclusive right to subsurface).
- **Loose objects on surface**: Finder wins UNLESS landowner manifested intent to exercise control over all objects on premises. *Hannah v. Peel*, 1 K.B. 509 (1945).

**Trespasser/wrongdoer rule**: A trespassing finder has **no rights** against the landowner (or true owner). Wrongdoers should not benefit from their wrongdoing. "No one can found a claim on their own wrong."

**Employee finder rule**: Property found by an employee **within the scope of employment** belongs to the employer, not the employee.

---

### Elements breakdown

**1. Airspace trespass (modern rule)**
   - **Elements**:
     - Invasion of airspace above landowner's property
     - **Below navigable altitude** (FAA-defined)
     - **Interferes with actual use/enjoyment** of land
   - **Effect**: Landowner can sue for trespass/nuisance
   - **Limitation**: High-altitude overflights are privileged (navigable airspace belongs to public domain)

**2. Subsurface rights**
   - **Elements**:
     - Landowner has exclusive right to **extract** resources beneath surface
     - Right is *in situ* (in place) but subject to rule of capture for fugitive resources
   - **Effect**: Can mine, drill, excavate beneath own land
   - **Limitation**: If oil/gas/water migrates to neighbor's land, neighbor can capture it (no liability for drainage)

**3. Finder's superior claim (Armory)**
   - **Elements**:
     - Actual possession (physical control)
     - No one with prior/superior right appears
   - **Effect**: Finder can sue third parties for conversion/damage
   - **Limitation**: True owner or prior possessor can always reclaim

**4. Lost vs. mislaid distinction**
   - **Lost**: Unintentional, unknowing parting with possession
     - Rule: Finder beats landowner
     - Rationale: True owner unlikely to remember where lost
   - **Mislaid**: Intentional placement + forgetting
     - Rule: Landowner/premises possessor beats finder
     - Rationale: True owner more likely to return to where they left it
   - **Trap**: Classification is often manipulated to reach desired outcome (courts have discretion)

**5. Landowner's constructive possession**
   - **Elements**:
     - Object is **in/under/attached to** the land OR
     - Landowner manifested **intent to exercise control** over all objects on premises
   - **Effect**: Landowner has constructive possession, beats finder
   - **Limitation**: Mere ownership of premises is insufficient for loose surface objects without manifest intent

---

### Common traps (what professor punishes)

- **Assuming ad coelum is absolute**: Traditional rule is obsolete; modern rule requires interference with actual use
- **Ignoring navigable airspace exception**: High-altitude flights are NOT trespasses
- **Confusing lost vs. mislaid**: Lost = unintentional; mislaid = intentional placement + forgetting (but classification is often outcome-driven)
- **Assuming landowner always wins**: Landowner wins for attached/buried objects, but NOT for loose objects absent manifest intent to control
- **Forgetting trespasser rule**: Trespassers never win against landowners (even if they find valuable objects)
- **Forgetting prior possessor**: Finder doesn't become "true owner"—just beats everyone except true owner and prior possessors

---

## EXPECTED PROFESSOR QUESTIONS

### Certainty vs. Incentives (recurring framework from Classes 1-2)

**Q: "Does the ad coelum doctrine promote certainty or incentives?"**

**Certainty argument**: Traditional ad coelum gives landowners a clear, bright-line rule (you own everything up and down). No need to litigate "how high" or "how deep." Enables planning and investment.

**Incentive argument**: But absolute ad coelum would chill productive uses of airspace/subsurface. Airlines couldn't fly; neighbors couldn't drill for oil. Modern rule (actual use) incentivizes productive exploitation while protecting landowners' reasonable expectations.

**Trade-off**: Modern ad coelum sacrifices certainty (vague "actual use" standard) to enable socially valuable activities (aviation, mining). Courts balance on a case-by-case basis.

---

**Q: "Why does the law distinguish lost vs. mislaid? Doesn't this create uncertainty?"**

**Rationale**: True owner is more likely to return to where they intentionally left something (mislaid) than to retrace random steps (lost). Giving landowner custody of mislaid property maximizes reunion probability.

**Critique**: But the distinction is manipulable. Courts classify based on desired outcome (if court wants landowner to win, calls it "mislaid"). Defeats certainty rationale.

**Professor's likely point**: Another example of certainty vs. functional reasoning. Rule aims to promote owner-reunification (instrumental goal) but creates vague standard that generates litigation.

---

**Q: "Should finders have any rights against true owners?"**

**No** (and that's the rule): True owner always prevails. Finder is merely a bailee (holds for true owner). Finder has no ownership interest, just superior possessory claim against third parties.

**Why?**: Allowing finders to acquire ownership would reward accidental discovery and undermine security of ownership. Original owner didn't voluntarily relinquish (except in abandonment).

**Connection to Pierson**: First possession only applies to **unowned** resources (wild animals, abandoned property). Once owned, ownership persists until voluntarily relinquished or adversely possessed.

---

**Q: "If landowner owns subsurface minerals in place, why can neighbor capture them via drilling?"**

**Rule of capture for fugitive resources**: Oil, gas, groundwater are fugitive (migrate underground). Landowner owns them *in situ*, but if they migrate to neighbor's land, neighbor can capture without liability.

**Rationale**: Impossible to trace ownership of flowing substances. Encouraging capture incentivizes productive extraction (Lockean labor theory: mixing labor with resource creates entitlement).

**Critique**: Creates "race to the bottom"—all neighbors drill simultaneously to avoid drainage. Leads to wasteful overproduction. (Note: modern oil/gas law addresses this via pooling/unitization agreements and conservation regulations.)

**Connection to Pierson**: Rule of capture is another application of first possession. If you capture it first, it's yours (even if it came from neighbor's land).

---

### Institutional Choice Questions (recurring from Ghen)

**Q: "Should courts or legislatures decide the extent of airspace rights?"**

**Courts**: Common law can adapt case-by-case (Causby: low flights interfere with use; high flights don't). Flexible, context-specific.

**Legislatures**: FAA regulations define navigable airspace precisely. Bright-line rule (e.g., 500 feet minimum altitude). Certainty for airlines and landowners.

**Trade-off**: Livingston's "tribunal of sportsmen" critique from Pierson applies here. Do courts have expertise to balance aviation interests vs. property rights? Or should FAA/Congress decide?

---

**Q: "Should lost/mislaid classification be determined by custom (e.g., what stores typically do with lost wallets)?"**

**Custom argument** (Ghen framework): If store owners universally hold wallets for customers (and customers expect this), custom should govern. Longstanding, reasonable, limited scope.

**Critique**: But customs vary (some stores keep wallets; others turn over to police). No universal practice. Also, customers may not know the custom (information cost problem).

**Professor's likely point**: Custom works best in cohesive industries (whalers in Ghen) but poorly for general public spaces. Default legal rules needed.

---

**Q: "Who's right in Edwards—the majority (ad coelum gives Lee subsurface rights) or the dissent (Edwards owns the cave through discovery and use)?"**

**Majority position (traditional ad coelum)**: Lee owns the surface, therefore owns everything beneath it to the center of the earth. If cave extends under Lee's land, Edwards is trespassing. Clear, bright-line rule protects surface owners' expectations.

**Dissent position (functional ownership)**: Surface owner only owns what he can **actually use for profit or pleasure**. Lee has no entrance to the cave, cannot use it, cannot benefit from it. Edwards discovered, explored, developed the cave over 13 years—his labor creates ownership. Survey will destroy Edwards's business without benefiting Lee (wasteful outcome).

**Certainty vs. Incentives**: Majority favors certainty (clear ad coelum rule avoids litigation). Dissent favors incentives (reward productive labor; don't enable holdouts who can't use property but can block others).

**Connection to Causby**: Causby limited airspace ad coelum (high overflights OK; low flights that interfere with use = trespass). Edwards dissent proposes same for subsurface. But majority in Edwards preserves absolute subsurface ad coelum. **Result: Modern law has asymmetric ad coelum—limited above, absolute below.**

**Labor theory parallel to Pierson/Ghen**: Edwards's exploration/development = Ghen's whale-killing labor. Should be protected against Lee (who did nothing) just as Ghen was protected against Ellis (beach finder). But majority rejects this—first-in-time surface ownership trumps subsequent labor.

**Important**: Professor Lee reportedly **favors the dissent**. Be ready to argue functional approach (use-based ownership) vs. formalism (rigid ad coelum). This was a past midterm question.

**Coase theorem application** (if professor raises): Whether Lee or Edwards owns the cave determines initial entitlement, but parties should bargain to efficient outcome. If Edwards values cave more (likely—he has tourist business), he'll pay Lee to release rights. If Lee wins, Edwards buys him out. If Edwards wins, Lee can't pay Edwards to shut down (Lee has no use for cave). So Edwards-wins rule is more efficient (avoids transaction). But if Lee is entitled, he can hold out for extortionate price (bilateral monopoly problem—only Edwards and Lee can deal with each other).

## CASE BRIEFS (Quick Reference)

### United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256 (1946)

**Facts**: Chicken farmer near military airport. Low-flying planes (83 feet above land) caused chickens to panic and die. Farmer sued for inverse condemnation (taking without compensation).

**Holding**: Government liable. Flights were so low and frequent they made land unfit for use as chicken farm. Ad coelum doctrine extends to airspace within "immediate reaches" that landowner can make beneficial use of.

**Key language**: "If the landowner is to have full enjoyment of the land, he must have exclusive control of the immediate reaches of the enveloping atmosphere."

**Limitation**: "Congress has declared that navigable airspace is in the public domain." High-altitude flights (above navigable altitude) are NOT trespasses.

**Policy**: Balances landowner's right to use/enjoy land vs. public interest in air travel. Low flights that destroy use = taking; high flights that merely cross airspace = privileged.

**Connection to prior classes**: Certainty vs. incentives. Traditional ad coelum (certainty) gives way to functional test (incentivizing aviation while protecting landowners' actual use).

---

### Edwards v. Sims, 232 Ky. 791 (1929)

**Facts**: Edwards discovered and developed the "Great Onyx Cave" on his land, building a tourist business over 13 years. The cave entrance was on Edwards's property. Lee, an adjoining landowner, sued claiming part of the cave extended under his land. Lee sought an injunction preventing Edwards from using/exhibiting the portion under Lee's land, plus damages and an accounting of profits. Trial court ordered a survey of the cave to determine boundaries.

**Procedural posture**: Edwards sought writ of prohibition to prevent the court from ordering the survey, claiming it would irreparably harm his business and invade his property rights.

**Holding (Majority)**: Survey ordered. Traditional ad coelum rule applies—*Cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum et ad inferos* ("whoever owns the soil owns also to the sky and to the depths"). Lee, as surface owner, owns everything beneath his land. Court has inherent equitable power to order inspection/survey when there is reasonable ground to suspect trespass. If cave extends under Lee's land, Edwards is trespassing.

**Dissent (Logan, J.)**: Ad coelum is a "sophistry" that was never true and doesn't fit modern conditions. Surface owner should own only what he can "subject to his profit or pleasure"—what he can actually use. Edwards owns the cave through discovery, exploration, development, and conquest. Lee cannot use the cave portion under his land (has no entrance), so he shouldn't have rights to it. Survey will destroy Edwards's business without benefiting Lee. Equity should not permit such waste.

**Key language (Majority)**: "The owner of realty...is entitled to the free and unfettered control of his own land above, upon, and beneath the surface. So whatever is in a direct line between the surface of the land and the center of the earth belongs to the owner of the surface."

**Key language (Dissent)**: "A man who owns land does, in truth and in fact, own everything from zenith to nadir, but only for the use that he can make of it for his profit or pleasure. He owns nothing which he cannot subject to his dominion."

**Policy tension**: 
- **Majority**: Certainty and security of property rights. Clear rule (ad coelum) prevents disputes and protects landowners' expectations. Surface ownership must include subsurface.
- **Dissent**: Functional ownership based on actual use. Wasteful to give Lee rights he cannot exploit while destroying Edwards's productive business. Labor theory—Edwards "conquered" the cave through years of exploration and development.

**Connection to Causby**: Both cases address ad coelum limits. Causby limits airspace rights to "actual use" (aircraft can overfly at navigable altitude). Edwards dissent proposes same principle for subsurface (owner only owns what he can use). Majority rejects this—subsurface ad coelum remains absolute (unlike airspace).

**Connection to Pierson/Ghen**: Edwards dissent invokes labor theory—Edwards's exploration/development should create ownership (like Ghen's whale-killing labor). Majority focuses on first-in-time surface ownership, not subsequent labor in cave.

**Institutional choice**: Should courts (case-by-case equity) or bright-line property rules govern? Dissent favors equitable balancing (preventing waste). Majority favors rule-based certainty (ad coelum).

**Important note**: Professor Lee reportedly favors the dissent (this was a midterm question in past years). Watch for questions testing whether you understand the dissent's functional approach vs. majority's formalism.

### Armory v. Delamirie, 93 Eng. Rep. 664 (K.B. 1722)

**Facts**: Chimney sweep boy found jewel. Took it to goldsmith for appraisal. Goldsmith's apprentice removed stones from setting and refused to return them. Boy sued goldsmith.

**Holding**: Finder (boy) wins. Finder has title good against all the world except true owner. Goldsmith could not show prior/superior right, so finder prevails.

**Key principle**: **Possession is title** as against anyone who cannot show prior right.

**Damages**: Because goldsmith refused to return jewel, court presumes it was the finest stone possible. Finder recovers maximum value (punishment for wrongdoer).

**Policy**: Protects possessors from wrongful dispossession. Encourages finders to bring found goods to market (promoting commerce). Security of possession prevents "might makes right."

**Connection to Pierson**: First possession creates property right. Even if boy's possession was "recent" or "brief," it's sufficient to beat third parties (just not true owner).

---

### Hannah v. Peel, 1 K.B. 509 (1945)

**Facts**: WWII soldier (Hannah) stationed in requisitioned house (owned by Peel, who never lived there). Hannah found brooch on floor. Peel claimed it as landowner.

**Holding**: Finder (Hannah) wins. Landowner has constructive possession only if: (1) object is attached to/under land, OR (2) landowner manifested intent to exercise control over all objects on premises. Here, Peel never occupied house and had no knowledge of brooch, so no constructive possession.

**Key principle**: Mere ownership of land does NOT give constructive possession of loose objects on surface **absent manifest intent to control.**

**Policy**: Finder's labor (discovering the object) deserves protection. Landowner who never occupied has done nothing to "mix labor" with object.

**Limitation**: If object is buried or attached, landowner always wins (exclusive right to subsurface).

**Connection to Ghen**: Could Hannah's finding be governed by custom? If military had custom that soldiers turn over valuables to commanding officer, would that prevail? (No custom here, so common law applies.)

---

### Hypothetical: *Treasure Trove Cases* (archaic but illustrative)

**Traditional rule**: Hidden gold/silver/currency from long ago belongs to finder, not landowner.

**Rationale**: True owner is presumed dead; object was intentionally hidden (not lost or mislaid). Finder's discovery is productive labor.

**Modern status**: Mostly abolished. Most states give buried treasure to landowner (subsurface rights). Finder has no claim.

**Connection to ad coelum**: Landowner's subsurface rights extend to buried objects. Treasure trove was historical exception but inconsistent with modern subsurface ownership principles.

---

## POLICY / THEORY

### Certainty vs. Incentives (Classes 1-3 recurring theme)

**Ad coelum example**:
- **Traditional rule (certainty)**: Landowner owns to the sky and depths. Bright-line, no vagueness. (Edwards majority)
- **Modern rule (incentives)**: Landowner owns only to extent of actual use. Enables productive aviation, mining, drilling. (Causby for airspace; Edwards dissent argues for same principle in subsurface)
- **Trade-off**: Modern rule sacrifices certainty ("actual use" is vague) to incentivize socially valuable activities.
- **Asymmetry**: Causby adopted functional approach for airspace (high flights OK). Edwards majority rejected functional approach for subsurface (absolute ownership below). **Result: Ad coelum is limited above, absolute below.**

**Found property example**:
- **Tompkins-style certainty argument**: Finder always wins (clear rule). Or landowner always wins (equally clear). Bright lines avoid litigation.
- **Livingston-style incentive argument**: Reward the party whose actions promote social goals (finder who discovers? or landowner who maintains premises and facilitates owner-reunification?).
- **Actual law**: Context-specific rules (lost vs. mislaid; attached vs. loose). Sacrifices certainty for functional reasoning.

---

### Labor Theory (Locke) — Recurring Justification

**Pierson**: Post's labor (chasing fox) should be rewarded. Pearson free-rides.

**Ghen**: Whaler's dangerous labor (killing whale) should be protected. Finder on beach did no labor.

**Armory**: Chimney sweep's labor (finding jewel) creates possessory right. Goldsmith did no labor.

**Hannah**: Soldier's discovery (finding brooch) is labor. Landowner who never occupied did no labor.

**Edwards (dissent)**: Edwards's 13 years of cave exploration, development, advertising is productive labor. Lee (adjoining landowner who can't access cave) did no labor. Labor should create ownership. (Majority rejects this—first-in-time surface ownership trumps subsequent labor.)

**Ad coelum subsurface**: Neighbor who drills and captures oil has "mixed labor" with resource. Non-drilling neighbor did no labor (so loses resource via rule of capture).

**Unifying theme**: Property rights reward productive labor. But labor theory is **instrumental** (encourages socially valuable activity), not fairness-based.

---

### Binary Outcomes (American Law Default)

**Pierson**: Pearson owns fox OR Post does. No splitting.

**Armory**: Finder owns OR goldsmith does. No pro-rating based on goldsmith's appraisal labor.

**Hannah**: Finder owns OR landowner does. No shared ownership.

**Ad coelum**: Landowner has exclusive airspace rights up to navigable altitude. No "shared sky."

**Why?**: Administrability. Determining contribution percentages is costly/uncertain. Binary outcomes are harsh but avoid endless litigation.

---

### Institutional Choice (Who Decides?)

**Pierson (Livingston dissent)**: "Tribunals of sportsmen" should decide hunting customs, not courts.

**Ghen**: Whalers' custom governs because courts lack expertise. Custom is "longstanding, universal, and reasonable."

**Causby**: FAA/Congress defines navigable airspace (technical expertise). Courts defer to agency determination.

**Edwards**: Should courts use case-by-case equity (dissent's approach—prevent waste, reward labor) or rigid property rules (majority's approach—traditional ad coelum for certainty)? Dissent favors functional balancing; majority favors bright-line rules.

**Found property**: No industry custom (general public). Courts must decide using common law default rules.

**Pattern**: When specialized expertise exists (whaling, aviation), defer to custom or agency. When rules are for general public, courts must provide default legal rules.

---

## CONNECTION TO PRIOR CLASSES

### Class 1: Line-Standing Hypo

**Recurring questions**:
- What's ownable? (Line spots / Wild animals / Lost property / Airspace / Subsurface)
- How acquired? (First-in-time / First possession / Finding / Beneficial use)
- Transferable? (Selling line spots / Selling captured fox / Selling found jewel)
- Who decides? (Theater owner / Courts / Custom / FAA)

### Class 2: Pierson and Ghen

**Certainty vs. Incentives**: Tompkins (certainty via capture rule) vs. Livingston (incentives via "reasonable prospect"). Modern ad coelum (Causby) and Edwards dissent continue this tension—sacrificing bright-line certainty for functional rules that promote productive use.

**Labor Theory**: Post's pursuit labor / Whaler's killing labor / Finder's discovery labor / **Edwards's exploration labor**. Edwards dissent argues his 13 years of cave development should create ownership (parallel to Ghen). Majority rejects—first-in-time surface ownership trumps subsequent labor.

**Custom as gap-filler**: Ghen's custom prevails. Could found property be governed by store customs? Could airspace rights be governed by aviation customs? Edwards has no industry custom (cave tourism too new/localized).

**Binary outcomes**: Pearson owns or Post does. Ghen owns or Ellis does. Finder owns or landowner does. **Lee owns cave-under-his-land or Edwards does.** American law defaults to all-or-nothing.

**Institutional choice**: Livingston's "tribunal of sportsmen" / Ghen's whalers' custom / Causby's FAA regulations / **Edwards's equity vs. property-rule debate**. Who is best situated to decide—courts, custom, or agencies?

---

## QUICK HYPOS

### Hypo 1: Drone flying 150 feet above backyard

**Issue**: Is this an airspace trespass under modern ad coelum?

**Analysis**:
- Below navigable altitude (FAA navigable airspace starts ~500 feet)
- Does it interfere with landowner's **actual use/enjoyment**? (Causby standard)
- If drone hovers/photographs/disturbs, likely trespass (interferes with use)
- If drone merely passes through once, arguable (minimal interference)

**Policy**: Certainty (bright-line altitude rule) vs. incentives (enable drone technology while protecting privacy). Modern trend: state laws regulating low-altitude drones.

---

### Hypo 2: Wallet found on floor of restaurant

**Issue**: Lost vs. mislaid? Finder vs. restaurant owner?

**Analysis**:
- **If lost**: Finder beats restaurant (unintentional parting with possession; owner unlikely to remember where lost)
- **If mislaid**: Restaurant beats finder (intentional placement + forgetting; owner likely to return)
- **Classification problem**: Courts manipulate to reach desired outcome. If wallet on floor (seems lost), but if on table (seems mislaid)?

**Policy**: Facilitating owner-reunification. Restaurant is better positioned to hold for owner (owner might call to inquire). But if owner never returns, should finder or restaurant keep?

---

### Hypo 3: Employee finds cash in company parking lot

**Issue**: Employee vs. employer?

**Rule**: Employee finder rule—if found within scope of employment, belongs to employer.

**Analysis**:
- Is parking lot "within scope of employment"? Likely yes (employer maintains premises).
- Employee was on duty? If yes, employer wins.
- If employee was off-duty and just walking through, arguable (outside scope).

**Policy**: Employer owns premises and has constructive possession of objects on premises (Hannah manifest intent principle—employer controls parking lot).

---

### Hypo 4: Buried treasure found while trespassing on private land

**Issue**: Trespasser vs. landowner?

**Rule**: Trespasser has no rights against landowner. "No one can found a claim on their own wrong."

**Analysis**:
- Landowner owns subsurface (ad coelum applies to depths)
- Even if treasure trove historically belonged to finder, trespasser is wrongdoer and loses

**Policy**: Don't reward trespassing. Protecting landowners' exclusive subsurface rights.

---

### Hypo 5: Natural cave extends under multiple landowners' properties

**Issue**: Who owns the cave—landowner with entrance? All surface owners whose land cave runs under? First discoverer?

**Edwards majority rule**: Each surface owner owns the portion of cave directly beneath their land (traditional ad coelum). If someone enters cave and goes under neighbor's land, that's trespass. Each landowner could potentially block access to portions under their land.

**Edwards dissent rule**: Owner of entrance who discovered/developed cave owns entire cave, even portions under neighbors' land. Surface owners with no entrance cannot use cave, so shouldn't have rights. Reward productive labor (discovery/development).

**Practical problem with majority rule**: Cave owner at entrance becomes vulnerable to holdouts. Any surface owner above the cave can demand payment or shut down access to "their" portion. This creates bilateral monopoly problem and chills productive cave development.

**Policy tension**: Certainty (bright-line ad coelum protects surface owners' expectations) vs. Efficiency (functional rule prevents waste and rewards productive use).

**Professor's likely preference**: Edwards dissent (use-based ownership). Watch for this on exam.
