## ASSIGNMENT MAP (DON'T READ THE WRONG PAGES)

**CB 393–415** = Right to Exclude – Limits: Anti-Discrimination
- This section covers how civil rights laws limit property rights
- Likely cases: Heart of Atlanta Motel, Daniel v. Paul, or similar public accommodations cases
- Key theme: Private property rights are not absolute when serving the public

---

## CORE DOCTRINE

### Rule statements (copy-ready)

**Public Accommodation**: A business that offers goods, services, or facilities to the general public. Subject to anti-discrimination laws under state law, federal Civil Rights Act, and ADA.

**Right to Exclude vs. Anti-Discrimination**: Property owners generally have the right to exclude, but this right is **limited** when:
1. The business is a "public accommodation"
2. The exclusion is based on a protected characteristic (race, religion, etc.)
3. The exclusion would violate applicable civil rights laws

**Protected Characteristics** (typically):
- Race, color, religion, national origin (Civil Rights Act 1964)
- Sex, gender (many state laws)
- Disability (Americans with Disabilities Act)
- Sexual orientation, gender identity (many state/local laws)
- Other categories vary by jurisdiction

**Private Club Exception**: Some anti-discrimination laws contain exceptions for truly private clubs that are not open to the public.

---

### What to be ready to say out loud (cold-call safe)

**1) The core tension**
- Property rights give owners right to exclude
- Civil rights laws require equal access
- When property is open to the public, exclusion rights are limited

**2) Public accommodation doctrine**
- Businesses serving the public cannot discriminate
- This is a LIMIT on the fundamental right to exclude
- The limit applies because of public policy, not property law itself

**3) Heart of Atlanta (if covered) punchline**
- Federal government can regulate private businesses under Commerce Clause
- Racial discrimination in public accommodations affects interstate commerce
- Property rights do not include right to discriminate on protected grounds

**4) Modern context**
- Today's cases involve: LGBTQ+ discrimination, disability access, religious objections
- Courts continue to balance property rights vs. civil rights
- Some cases involve "public accommodation" definition (is a website a public accommodation?)

---

## EXPECTED PROFESSOR QUESTIONS (Q→A)

**Q**: If property is about the right to exclude, how can the government force you to serve people you don't want to serve?

**A**: The right to exclude is **not absolute**. When you open your property to the public as a business, you accept limitations imposed by public policy. Anti-discrimination laws reflect a judgment that civil rights outweigh property rights in certain contexts.

---

**Q**: What makes something a "public accommodation"?

**A**: Generally, a business that:
- Holds itself out as serving the public
- Is open to all who wish to use it (with narrow exceptions)
- Offers goods, services, or facilities to the general public
- Examples: restaurants, hotels, theaters, retail stores

The line gets tricky with:
- Private clubs (often exempt)
- Very small businesses (sometimes exempt under size thresholds)
- Online businesses (emerging area)

---

**Q**: Can a business owner refuse service for ANY reason that's not discriminatory?

**A**: Generally yes — businesses can refuse service for:
- Not wearing shoes/shirt
- Being disruptive
- Poor hygiene (sometimes)
- No shirt, no service policies

BUT cannot refuse for:
- Race, religion, national origin (federal)
- Other protected categories under state law
- The reason must be genuine and not a pretext for discrimination

---

**Q**: What about religious objections to serving certain customers?

**A**: This is an evolving area. Courts balance:
- Free Exercise rights
- Anti-discrimination laws
- Generally, neutral laws of general applicability can override religious objections
- Some states have Religious Freedom Restoration Acts that shift the analysis

## CASE BRIEFS (Quick Reference)

### _Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States_ (U.S. 1964)

*(Note: Confirm if this case is in the assigned pages)*

- **Setup**: Motel refused to serve Black guests; challenged constitutionality of Civil Rights Act
- **Holding**: Civil Rights Act is constitutional under Commerce Clause
- **Key reasoning**:
  - Racial discrimination affects interstate commerce
  - Congress has power to regulate local activities that substantially affect interstate commerce
  - Property rights do not include right to engage in racial discrimination
- **Significance**: Federal anti-discrimination law applies to private businesses serving the public

### _Daniel v. Paul_ (U.S. 1969)

*(Note: Confirm if this case is in the assigned pages)*

- **Setup**: Private recreation club refused Black family; club claimed not a public accommodation
- **Holding**: Club was a public accommodation under Civil Rights Act
- **Key reasoning**:
  - Look at substance, not just form
  - Club served the public, advertised to the public, had 2/3 non-member paying guests
  - Cannot avoid anti-discrimination laws by labeling yourself a "private club"

### Modern ADA/Disability Cases (likely covered in this section)

- **General principle**: Businesses must make **reasonable accommodations** for disabled patrons
- **Undue burden exception**: Some accommodations not required if too costly or difficult
- ** readily achievable standard**: For existing facilities, barriers must be removed if readily achievable

---

## POLICY/THEORY

**Why limit property rights for anti-discrimination?**

1. **Market failure argument**:
   - If discrimination is widespread, market won't correct itself
   - Discriminated groups can't "vote with their feet"
   - Segregated markets perpetuate inequality

2. **Historical context**:
   - Jim Crow, segregation, systematic exclusion
   - Market-based approaches failed to end discrimination
   - Legal intervention required

3. **Human dignity**:
   - Access to public accommodations is essential for full citizenship
   - Exclusion from public spaces stigmatizes entire groups
   - Equal access = equal participation in society

4. **Economic efficiency**:
   - Discrimination reduces overall economic output
   - Excluding talent/customers hurts economy
   - Open markets work better when inclusive

**Counterarguments (property rights perspective)**:

1. **Freedom of association**:
   - Shouldn't people choose who they associate with?
   - Private property should include private choices

2. **Slippery slope**:
   - Where do we draw the line?
   - What about private dinner parties? Small businesses?

3. **Economic liberty**:
   - Business owners should control their businesses
   - Market will punish discriminatory businesses (in theory)

## QUICK HYPOS

### Hypo 1: The "Private" Club
- Country club has 300 members, $10k initiation fee
- Hosts public golf tournaments
- Allows non-members to play for fees
- Restaurant open to non-members

**Is this a public accommodation?**
- Likely yes — too much public access
- Can't avoid anti-discrimination laws by calling itself "private"

### Hypo 2: The Small Restaurant
- Family-run restaurant with 12 seats
- Owner refuses to serve same-sex couple citing religious beliefs

**Can they refuse?**
- Depends on state law
- Federal law doesn't cover sexual orientation
- Many states do — check jurisdiction
- Small business exemption may or may not apply

### Hypo 3: The Disruptive Customer
- Black customer asked to leave restaurant for being loud
- White customers also asked to leave for being loud
- Black customer sues for discrimination

**Is this discrimination?**
- If race-neutral policy applied evenly — no discrimination
- If applied only to Black customers — potential discrimination
- Evidence of pretext matters

### Hypo 4: The Website
- Online retailer refuses to ship to certain zip codes
- Those zip codes are predominantly minority neighborhoods

**Is this a public accommodation issue?**
- Emerging area of law
- Websites as public accommodations?
- Facially neutral policy with discriminatory effect?

## CONNECTION TO PRIOR CLASSES

**From Class 7 (Shack)**:
- Property rights are not absolute
- Public policy can override exclusion
- Shack involved migrant workers — today's class involves broader civil rights

**From Classes 1-6 (Right to Exclude foundation)**:
- We've established exclusion as fundamental
- Now we're seeing LIMITS on that fundamental right
- The theme: Property rights exist within a legal/social framework

**Ongoing theme**:
- Tension between exclusion rights and public policy
- When does public interest override private property?
- Different contexts where this arises (necessity, criminal trespass, now discrimination)
