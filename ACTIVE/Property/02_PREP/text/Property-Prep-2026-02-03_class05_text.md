notes:
  - Main case is Moore; track the remedy shift (conversion → fiduciary duty / informed consent).
  - Professor-friendly theme: institutional choice (courts vs legislatures) + transaction costs.
  - Keep an eye on “in rem” spillovers if we call body parts “property.”

## ASSIGNMENT MAP (DON’T READ THE WRONG PAGES)

**CB 209–224** = Chapter III (“Values Subject to Ownership”) → Personhood → “Property and the Human Body”
- Starts with a short setup about **what is (and isn’t) eligible for property rights** (anti-commodification baseline: people ≠ property).
- Main case: **_Moore v. Regents of the Univ. of California_** (conversion vs. fiduciary duty / informed consent).
- Notes/questions immediately after _Moore_ (haircut / Henrietta Lacks / “in rem” risk / embryos/gametes).

## CORE DOCTRINE

### Rule statements (copy-ready)

**Anti-commodification baseline**: People are not permissible objects of property; the hard question is where to draw the boundary between “person” and “thing” when tech makes separation and transfer easy.

**_Moore_ (headline)**: A patient can have claims based on **physician disclosure / informed consent**, but (in _Moore_) does **not** have a conversion claim for excised cells used in research because the law does not recognize the requisite property interest for conversion in that setting.

**Property-as-bundle move**: Calling something “property” is not all-or-nothing; the law can recognize some sticks (e.g., control/disposition) while withholding others (e.g., sale/market transfer).

**In rem problem**: Property rights tend to run “against the world,” not just against the immediate wrongdoer. So recognizing a property right in excised cells can create downstream duty-bearers (labs, purchasers, later researchers) and higher clearance costs.

---

### What to be ready to say out loud (cold-call safe)

**1) What did Moore win/lose?**
- **Won (at least in principle)**: a theory tied to **non-disclosure** (fiduciary / informed consent).
- **Lost**: **conversion** (court rejects the needed property interest in removed cells).

**2) What work is “conversion” doing here?**
- Conversion is a **property-protecting tort**; if you can plead conversion, you’re trying to turn a wrong into an **in rem**-style entitlement with strong remedies (often including forced-value compensation).

**3) What’s the court’s institutional move?**
- “Even if there are good reasons to treat this like property, courts aren’t the right institution; legislatures can set a system (consent, compensation, transfer limits) without destabilizing medical research.”

---

## EXPECTED PROFESSOR QUESTIONS (Q→A)

**Q:** Is the holding “body parts aren’t property” or “no conversion claim on these facts”?

**A:** Read it as narrower: **no conversion claim** because the court won’t recognize the relevant property interest in excised cells in this context, while still recognizing other legal protections (disclosure/informed consent) and leaving room for statutory regulation.

---

**Q:** If Moore can refuse consent unless he gets paid, doesn’t that mean he has a property right?

**A:** Not necessarily. The law can protect **autonomy/consent** without granting an alienable property right in the removed tissue. But it does highlight the bundle question: what “control” stick exists, and when does control shade into a property-like entitlement?

---

**Q:** Why does “in rem” matter to the court?

**A:** Because a property entitlement can create **liability for remote parties** and force costly provenance checking. That risk is a major reason to prefer a **doctor-focused duty** (disclosure) rather than a world-running property claim.

---

**Q:** Courts vs legislature — what’s the argument, concretely?

**A:** Legislatures can design **rules + procedures** (consent forms, registries, compensation schemes, transfer limits) and calibrate tradeoffs (research incentives vs patient autonomy) without the bluntness of common-law conversion.

---

**Q:** What’s the best pro-Moore dissent-style intuition?

**A:** “This is _his_ tissue; if someone turns it into money without telling him, that looks like appropriation. Property can exist with restrictions; denying any property framing lets institutions capture value and leaves patients with weak bargaining power.”

---

## CASE BRIEFS (Quick Reference)

### _Moore v. Regents of the University of California_ (Cal. 1990)

- **Setup**: Patient’s excised cells used to create a valuable cell line; patient sues including conversion.
- **Holding (for this class)**: **No conversion**; **yes** to a disclosure-based theory (fiduciary duty / informed consent).
- **Reasoning themes to remember**:
  - Existing legal/regulatory structure limits what can be done with excised tissue.
  - High social value + transaction-cost concerns around research if every cell line carries title risk.
  - Institutional competence: legislatures can draw the property/market boundaries more cleanly.
- **Professor Lee angle**: This is a “who should update property law?” case (similar to earlier custom/coordination debates, but with higher stakes).

### (Optional context if it comes up) _Flynn v. Holder_ (9th Cir. 2012)

**Note:** This case begins right after the _Moore_ notes in the casebook; the syllabus assigns **through CB 224**, so treat the details as optional unless Professor Lee signals otherwise.

- **Issue**: National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) bars compensation for transfer of certain “human organs,” including “bone marrow.” Does that ban cover **peripheral blood stem cell apheresis** (a blood-donation-like procedure)?
- **Holding (as excerpted)**: Statute (as construed) does **not** criminalize compensating donors for that apheresis-based procedure.
- **Why it’s here**: Shows how **definition/thinghood** questions (“what counts as ‘bone marrow’?”) can decide market-inalienability without directly answering “is it property?”

---

## POLICY / THEORY

Use whichever frame matches the professor’s direction:

- **Autonomy/consent**: people should control use of excised tissue; disclosure protects that.
- **Research & transaction costs**: property framing may raise clearance burdens, slow research, and create holdout problems.
- **Equity/fairness**: value is extracted from patients; denying a property remedy may entrench unequal bargaining power.
- **Institutional choice**: legislatures can set a stable regime (compensation allowed? consent rules? bans on sale?) with fewer spillovers.

---

## QUICK HYPOS

1) **Haircut resale**: Barber sells your hair clippings. Abandonment? Personality interest? Does it matter if the hair is uniquely valuable (celebrity)?

2) **No disclosure**: Patient would have refused procedure if told the doctor had a financial stake. What claim fits best: conversion, fiduciary duty, lack of informed consent, unjust enrichment?

3) **Embryo dispute**: Ex-spouses disagree about frozen embryos. Is the legal framing “property,” “person,” or a sui generis category? What stick (use/transfer/destroy) matters?

---

## CONNECTION TO PRIOR CLASSES

- **Relativity/institutional choice**: Like custom cases, this is partly “what rule best coordinates behavior?” and “who should make it?”
- **In rem vs in personam**: Conversion would push toward a world-running entitlement; disclosure duties are more relational (doctor/patient).
