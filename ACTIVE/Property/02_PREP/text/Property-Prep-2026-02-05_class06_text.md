title: Right to Exclude — Trespass and Repeated Trespasses
status: draft
inputs:
  syllabus_assignment: CB 1-17, 415-425 (right to exclude — trespass to land; repeated trespasses)
  past_outline: ACTIVE/Property/01_SOURCES/past_outlines/Professor Lee, Property Spring 2024.txt
notes:
  - Focus on remedies (nominal/punitive; injunction) as much as elements.
  - Distinguish repeated trespass (series) vs continuous trespass (encroachment — next class).
  - Jacque facts connect back to AP (permission defeats hostility).

## ASSIGNMENT MAP (DON’T READ THE WRONG PAGES)

**CB 1–17** = Chapter I (“What Is Property?”) → Trespass to land
- Core case: **_Jacque v. Steenberg Homes_** (intentional trespass; nominal + punitive).
- Then: **_Hinman v. Pacific Air Transport_** (limits of ad coelum / airspace “use”).

**CB 415–425** = Equity intro → “Repeated trespasses”
- Core case: **_Baker v. Howard County Hunt_** (series of trespasses → injunction standards).

---

## CORE DOCTRINE

### Rule statements (copy-ready)

**Trespass to land (black-letter)**: A person is liable for trespass if they **intentionally** enter land in the possession of another (or cause a thing/person to enter), or remain, or fail to remove a thing they’re under a duty to remove; **harm to the land is not required** for liability.

**Intent (trespass)**: The intent required is typically **intent to enter** the land (not intent to violate another’s rights).

**Remedies (big picture)**:
- **Completed one-off trespass**: usually damages (nominal/compensatory; punitive if egregious).
- **Repeated trespasses**: damages are possible, but equity may grant an **injunction** if legal remedies are inadequate.

**Airspace / ad coelum (modern approach)**: The right to exclude does not extend upward indefinitely; airspace rights track **actual/beneficial use** and interference with use (not abstract infinite ownership).

**Repeated trespass → injunction (Baker-style)**: Equity can enjoin a series of trespasses when:
- **No adequate remedy at law** (damages can’t be measured or won’t prevent repeated harm / endless suits), and
- **Plaintiff has clean hands** (as to the dispute).

---

### What to be ready to say out loud (cold-call safe)

**1) Definition + why it matters**
- Trespass protects **exclusive possession**; it’s the doctrinal home of the “right to exclude.”

**2) Jacque’s punchline**
- Even with **no measurable harm**, intentional trespass vindicates a legally protected interest; **nominal damages** are available and can support **punitive damages** to deter.

**3) Baker’s punchline**
- If trespasses keep happening, courts don’t want **a lawsuit per trespass**; injunction is available when damages won’t do the job.

---

## EXPECTED PROFESSOR QUESTIONS (Q→A)

**Q:** Why allow punitive damages when the only compensatory award is $1 nominal?

**A:** Because the “real” harm is the **invasion of the right to exclude**, and without meaningful deterrence, repeat players will rationally treat trespass as a priced option. Punitive damages also reduce the incentive for **self-help** escalation.

---

**Q:** Should the right to exclude have a reasonableness limit (Jacque seems unreasonable)?

**A:** That’s the core policy fight: a reasonableness test could reduce holdouts and waste, but it weakens the clarity/strength of possession and could shift disputes into messy balancing. Watch whether Professor Lee wants you to notice “rules vs standards.”

---

**Q:** The Jacques were worried about adverse possession — does that make sense?

**A:** Mostly no: **permission defeats hostility**, and one crossing won’t satisfy the statutory period. But it’s a good reminder that exclusion + boundary enforcement plays into AP incentives.

---

**Q:** Why isn’t every overflight a trespass under ad coelum?

**A:** Because “owning infinity” is not workable; air/sea are treated as incapable of private ownership except insofar as they are **actually used** or the use interferes with the surface owner’s beneficial use.

---

**Q:** Why does equity step in for repeated trespasses (Baker)?

**A:** Because damages can be **hard to measure** (peaceful enjoyment, ongoing interference) and because repeated acts create a problem of **serial litigation**; an injunction is a one-shot way to prevent the continuing pattern.

## CASE BRIEFS (Quick Reference)

### _Jacque v. Steenberg Homes, Inc._ (Wis. 1997)

- **Setup**: Delivery company intentionally crosses land after repeated refusal; no physical damage.
- **Holding (for this class)**: Nominal damages for intentional trespass can support punitive damages.
- **Reasoning themes to remember**:
  - Property law treats land intrusion as a serious violation even without measurable harm.
  - Deterrence: without punitives, trespass becomes a “pay $1 and do it anyway” strategy for repeat players.
  - Avoid self-help: law supplies a strong remedy so owners don’t escalate privately.
- **Professor Lee angle**: Great case for “rules (strong exclusion) vs standards (reasonableness).”

### _Hinman v. Pacific Air Transport_ (9th Cir. 1936)

- **Setup**: Landowner seeks to block planes passing through airspace.
- **Holding (for this class)**: Ad coelum does not create an infinite exclusion right; airspace rights track actual use / interference.
- **Exam/class use**: If asked “trespass vs nuisance,” note the role of **actual and substantial interference** (trespass claim weak if no use/interference).

### _Baker v. Howard County Hunt_ (Md. 1936)

- **Setup**: Foxhounds repeatedly enter land; interfere with use (and kill chickens); plaintiff seeks injunction.
- **Holding (for this class)**: Repeated trespasses can be enjoined in equity.
- **What to memorize**:
  - **No adequate remedy at law** (intangible/incalculable harm; or repeated acts make damages ineffective).
  - **Clean hands** (plaintiff’s responsive conduct doesn’t bar relief if not too wrongful as to the dispute).

---

## POLICY / THEORY

- **Security/peace**: Strong trespass rules protect owner autonomy and reduce conflict.
- **Deterrence**: Without punitives/strong remedies, trespass is under-deterred when harm is hard to price.
- **Efficiency counterpoint**: Absolute exclusion can enable holdout/waste (e.g., cheapest route blocked for idiosyncratic reasons).
- **Equity as “safety valve”**: Injunctions address repeated harms that damages can’t solve, but raise concerns about judicial discretion.

---

## QUICK HYPOS

1) **Delivery shortcut**: Same facts as _Jacque_, but company offers $5,000 and owner refuses. Does that change doctrine or just policy instincts?

2) **Drone overflight**: Drone flies 20 feet above backyard daily; no physical damage. Trespass? Nuisance? What facts decide “actual interference”?

3) **Repeat dog trespass**: Neighbor’s dog runs onto your land every day; you can prove no crop damage but it disrupts use. Damages every time vs injunction?

---

## CONNECTION TO PRIOR CLASSES

- **Ad coelum**: We’ve seen the maxim; _Hinman_ is the modern trimming of that principle.
- **Adverse possession**: Exclusion/boundary enforcement is the flip side of AP incentives; permissive entry ≠ hostile.
