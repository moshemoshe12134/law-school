## CORE DOCTRINE

### Rule statements (copy-ready)

**License**: A **revocable permission** to enter or use another's land for a specific purpose. It is a personal privilege, NOT a property interest. Can be terminated at will by the licensor.

**Key Characteristics of Licenses**:
- **Revocable** at will (unless coupled with an interest or estoppel applies)
- **Personal** — doesn't transfer with land
- **Permission-based** — creates no estate or interest
- **Specific purpose** — limited to what was granted

**License Coupled with an Interest**: A license that becomes **irrevocable** because it's connected to a separate property interest (like an easement or profit). Terminating the license would destroy the property interest.

**Estoppel/Reliance**: A license may become **irrevocable** if:
- Licensee reasonably **relies** on the license
- Licensee **incurs expenses** or makes investments in reliance
- Injustice would result from revocation

**Bailment**: A **temporary transfer of possession** (not ownership) of personal property for a specific purpose. Bailee has duty to care for the property and return it.

**Elements of Bailment**:
1. **Personal property** (not real property)
2. **Transfer of possession** (bailee takes control)
3. **Temporary** (not permanent transfer)
4. **Specific purpose** (storage, repair, transport, etc.)
5. **Intent to return** property to bailor

**Standard of Care in Bailment**:
- **Sole benefit of bailor**: Slight care (bailee as gratuitous bailee)
- **Sole benefit of bailee**: Great care (must use extraordinary care)
- **Mutual benefit**: Ordinary care (reasonable person standard)

---

### What to be ready to say out loud (cold-call safe)

**1) License vs. Lease vs. Easement**
- **License**: Permission, revocable, personal
- **Lease**: Estate in land (tenancy), not revocable at will, transfers with property
- **Easement**: Property interest in land, runs with land, not revocable at will

**2) License punchline**
- A license is just permission — owner can revoke whenever they want
- Unless exceptions apply (coupled with interest, estoppel, contract)

**3) Estoppel punchline**
- If licensee spends money in reasonable reliance, owner may be "estopped" from revoking
- This is an EQUITABLE exception to revocability
- Policy: prevents injustice from reliance

**4) Bailment punchline**
- Bailment = temporary possession of personal property for specific purpose
- Standard of care depends on who benefits
- Bailee must return property or be liable for damage/loss

---

## EXPECTED PROFESSOR QUESTIONS (Q→A)

**Q**: Why would anyone accept a license if it can be revoked at will?

**A**:
1. **Convenience**: Often easier than creating formal property interests
2. **Temporary needs**: If you only need permission for a short time, revocability isn't a problem
3. **Relationship-based**: Between friends/family, risk of revocation is low
4. **Contract protection**: Contract law may create remedies for wrongful revocation
5. **Practicality**: Cheaper/faster than easements or leases

---

**Q**: What's the difference between revoking a license and breaching a contract?

**A**:
- **Revoking license**: Generally lawful — licenses are at-will
- **Breach of contract**: If license is part of a contract, revoking might be breach
- The distinction matters because:
  - Revoking alone = no liability (license ends)
  - Breaching = damages for contract violation
- Courts sometimes find implied contracts where licenses exist

---

**Q**: How does "license coupled with an interest" work?

**A**:
- License is tied to a SEPARATE property interest
- Example: Utility company has easement to run power lines + license to enter property to maintain them
- License can't be revoked because it would destroy the easement
- The "coupling" makes the license effectively irrevocable

---

**Q**: Why is the standard of care different in bailments?

**A**:
- **Policy**: Align incentives with benefits
- **Sole benefit of bailor** (free storage): Bailee gets nothing, owes slight care — don't want to discourage free help
- **Sole benefit of bailee** (borrowing car for free): Bailee gets all benefit, owes great care
- **Mutual benefit** (paid parking): Both benefit, ordinary care — reasonable person

## CASE BRIEFS (Quick Reference)

### License Cases

*(Note: Specific cases in these pages vary by edition — check your casebook for the actual cases)*

**Typical license revocability case**:
- **Setup**: A allows B to use land; B builds something; A revokes permission
- **Issue**: Is the license revocable despite B's investment?
- **Holding**: Generally yes — licenses are at-will UNLESS estoppel applies

**Typical estoppel case**:
- **Setup**: Licensee spends significant money in reasonable reliance on license
- **Holding**: Owner estopped from revoking — would be unjust
- **Key factor**: Was the reliance reasonable?

### Bailment Cases

*(Note: Specific cases in these pages vary by edition)*

**Typical bailment for mutual benefit case**:
- **Setup**: Pay to park car in garage; car damaged
- **Issue**: What standard of care does garage owe?
- **Holding**: Ordinary care (mutual benefit)

**Typical gratuitous bailment case**:
- **Setup**: Friend stores your stuff for free; stuff gets damaged
- **Issue**: What standard of care?
- **Holding**: Slight care (bailee only liable for gross negligence)

## POLICY/THEORY

**Why allow licenses at all?**

1. **Flexibility**:
   - Owners can grant permission without formalities
   - No need for deeds, writing, recording
   - Enables casual arrangements

2. **Economic efficiency**:
   - Low transaction costs for temporary uses
   - Doesn't cloud title with permanent interests

3. **Control**:
   - Owner retains ultimate control
   - Can revoke if circumstances change

**Why limit revocability (estoppel, coupled with interest)?**

1. **Reliance protection**:
   - Prevents injustice from reasonable investments
   - Encourages productive use of property

2. **Expectations**:
   - If licensee reasonably expects permanence, law protects that
   - Prevents "bait and switch"

3. **Security**:
   - Certain relationships (utilities, etc.) need stability
   - License coupled with interest protects necessary arrangements

**Why bailment law's graduated standard of care?**

1. **Incentive alignment**:
   - Care obligation matches benefit received
   - Prevents over-deterrence of free arrangements

2. **Fairness**:
   - Those who benefit should bear corresponding responsibility
   - Don't want to discourage helpful behavior (free storage)

## QUICK HYPOS

### Hypo 1: The Ticket Holder
- Concert ticket = license to enter venue
- Venue refuses entry because attendee is visibly drunk
- Can they do that?

**Answer**: Yes — license is revocable. Ticket is permission, not property right.

### Hypo 2: The Store Display
- Store allows neighbor to display art in window for free
- Neighbor spends $5k on custom framing
- Store revokes permission

**Is estoppel available?**
- Likely yes — reasonable reliance + significant expense
- Store may be estopped from revoking

### Hypo 3: The Utility Company
- Utility company has easement to run lines
- Also has license to enter property to maintain lines
- Property owner tries to revoke license

**Is license revocable?**
- No — coupled with interest (easement)
- Revoking would destroy easement rights

### Hypo 4: The Borrowed Car
- A borrows B's car for a week (gratis)
- A is in accident through no fault of his own
- Is A liable?

**Analysis**:
- Bailment for sole benefit of bailee
- Standard: Great care
- If A used great care and still damaged = probably not liable
- If A was negligent = liable

### Hypo 5: The Paid Parking Garage
- P parks in garage, pays $20
- Car stolen due to garage's negligence
- Is garage liable?

**Analysis**:
- Bailment for mutual benefit
- Standard: Ordinary care
- If garage was negligent = liable
- Damages likely limited to actual loss

## CONNECTION TO PRIOR CLASSES

**From Classes 1-8 (Right to Exclude)**:
- We've been studying the RIGHT to exclude
- Now we're studying VOLUNTARILY ceding that right
- License = allowing entry but keeping control
- Contrast with adverse possession (losing exclusion through time)

**From earlier exclusions**:
- Necessity (Class 7-8) — FORCED sharing of exclusion right
- Licenses — VOLUNTARY sharing of exclusion right
- Both create limited rights to enter/use property

**Theme evolution**:
- Started with acquiring property
- Moved to excluding others
- Now: voluntarily allowing others limited use
- Next: transferring property (sale, gift)

## EXAM SIGNALS
