## CORE DOCTRINE

### Rule statements (copy-ready)

**First possession rule (wild animals)**: Property in wild animals is acquired by occupancy (capture), not by mere pursuit. Capture requires actual physical control that removes the animal's natural liberty. *Pierson v. Post*, 3 Cai. R. 175 (N.Y. 1805).

**Mortal wounding + fresh pursuit exception**: Mortal wounding coupled with continued pursuit can constitute capture even before physical possession. Id.

**Custom as law**: Courts may recognize industry custom as creating property rights when: (1) the custom is longstanding and universal within the industry, (2) it represents the only practical means of appropriation given the nature of the resource, and (3) refusing to recognize it would destroy the industry. *Ghen v. Rich*, 8 F. 159 (D. Mass. 1881).

**Roots of title**: Ownership chains must start somewhere. First possession (along with creation, discovery, and accession) serves as a root of title—an initial event that creates ownership without a prior transfer.

### Elements breakdown

**1. Capture (for wild animals)**

- **Definition**: Physical control sufficient to deprive the animal of its natural liberty
- **Ambiguity**: How much control is "enough"? Does it require actual touching/physical possession?
- **Interpretation**: Courts favor bright-line rules (actual capture) over standards (pursuit + intention) for certainty and reduced conflict

**2. Custom-based rights (fishing/whaling)**

- **Elements**:
  - Universal practice within the industry
  - Longstanding usage
  - Practical necessity (the only feasible method of appropriation)
  - Limited to specific context (doesn't bind outsiders beyond industry)
- **Ambiguity**: When does a practice become "custom"? How universal must it be?
- **Tension**: Custom helps insiders but may bind outsiders who lack notice

**3. Accession**

- **Definition**: Ownership of a primary thing extends to related subordinate things (e.g., fruits of a tree, offspring of animals)
- **Justification**: Efficiency, predictability, reduces transaction costs

### Common traps (what professor punishes)

- **Confusing pursuit with possession**: Pursuit alone ≠ property right (Pierson majority)
- **Ignoring the certainty rationale**: The rule isn't just about fairness to the pursuer—it's about reducing conflict ex ante
- **Missing the custom/outsider problem**: Custom binds insiders who know it, but binding outsiders raises notice/fairness concerns
- **Conflating "first in time" with desert**: First possession is a coordination rule, not primarily about rewarding labor
- **Failing to distinguish when custom should/shouldn't be recognized**: Not all customs become law; courts look for necessity + industry-wide acceptance

## EXPECTED PROFESSOR QUESTIONS (Q→A)

### "Big picture" questions

**Q:** Why does the law care about "first possession" at all? Why not just let people fight over resources?

**A:** First possession creates clear, public signals of ownership that coordinate behavior and reduce conflict. Without it, every resource would be subject to endless dispute. The rule channels competition into productive activity (finding/capturing unclaimed things) rather than fighting over who has better claim.

**Alternate plausible answer:** First possession rewards labor (Lockean justification) and encourages productive exploitation of resources.

**Likely pushback:** "But doesn't first-in-time cause wasteful races? What if Post spent hours tracking the fox and Pierson just swoops in at the last second?"

**How to resolve on an exam:** Acknowledge the race-to-capture problem but note that pursuit-based rules would create MORE uncertainty and conflict. The bright-line rule accepts some unfairness to individual pursuers to achieve systemic benefits (fewer disputes, clearer coordination). Compare to patent law—first to invent vs. first to file.

---

**Q:** Who is the "audience" for possession? Who needs to understand the signal that someone owns this?

**A:** Multiple audiences: rival claimants (other hunters), the landowner, the general public, courts (if dispute arises). The signal must be clear enough that others can recognize it and stand down.

**Likely pushback:** "If it's for hunters, why not use hunter custom? They all understand pursuit-based rules."

**How to resolve:** Custom works within close-knit groups but breaks down when outsiders encounter the practice. Bright-line rules (capture) are legible to broader audiences. Trade-off between context-sensitivity (custom) and universality (bright-line rules).

---

**Q:** When should courts recognize custom as creating legal rights?

**A:** *Ghen* framework: (1) longstanding, universal practice within industry; (2) practical necessity—the only feasible way to appropriate the resource; (3) refusing recognition would destroy the industry.

**Counterargument:** Custom can be oppressive, exclusionary, or inefficient. It may bind outsiders who lack notice. Courts should be skeptical of converting private norms into law.

**How to resolve on an exam:** Apply *Ghen* factors. If custom meets all three (universal, necessary, industry-vital), recognition is justified. If custom is parochial, optional, or harms outsiders disproportionately, reject it.

---

### Doctrine parsing questions

**Q:** Is Pierson's act wrongful? Should the law punish him?

**A:** Morally questionable (knew Post was pursuing), but legally permissible. Post lacked a property right, so Pierson violated no legal duty. The dissent would impose liability to deter interference, but the majority refuses to expand liability without a clear property rule.

**Counterargument:** The law could recognize a tort of interference with prospective capture (like interference with prospective economic advantage).

**How to resolve:** The majority rejects creating liability in the absence of property. Property must come first; tort liability follows. Expanding liability without clear property rules would create uncertainty.

---

**Q:** What if Post mortally wounded the fox and continued pursuit—would he have a claim?

**A:** Yes, under the majority's dicta. Mortal wounding + fresh pursuit can constitute capture because the animal's escape is no longer practically possible.

**Likely pushback:** "Isn't that just pursuit by another name?"

**Response:** No—mortal wounding changes the animal's status. It's no longer at liberty. The rule is still control-based, just with a lower threshold where escape is impossible.

---

**Q:** Does the landowner have any claim to the fox?

**A:** Potentially. English doctrine of *ratione soli* (ownership by reason of the soil) would give landowner constructive possession of animals on unenclosed land. But American courts generally reject this for unenclosed land/waste land. If land is enclosed or the landowner actively excludes others, stronger claim.

---

**Q:** Is the *Ghen* whaling custom fair to the finder who reports the whale?

**A:** The finder gets a modest salvage payment (not full value), which incentivizes reporting and recovery. Without salvage, finders might hide/sell the whale. With excessive salvage, killers might not hunt (too risky). The custom balances incentives.

**Likely pushback:** "But the finder did the hard work of recovery!"

**Response:** The killer created the value (killed the whale). Recovery is easier/cheaper than hunting. The custom encourages both hunting (killer keeps most value) and reporting (finder gets salvage).

## CASE BRIEFS

### Pierson v. Post, 3 Cai. R. 175 (N.Y. 1805)

**Rule of Law**
Property in wild animals is acquired by occupancy (capture), not by mere pursuit.

**Facts + Procedural Posture**

1. Post hunts a fox on unoccupied land with hounds
2. Pierson, knowing of the pursuit, kills and takes the fox
3. Post sues in tort (action of trespass on the case)
4. Trial court: verdict for Post; defendant appeals

**Issue**
Does pursuit of a wild animal, without capture, create a property right sufficient to support a claim against an interloper?

**Holding & Reasoning**

### (Tompkins, J.)

**No.** Capture required for property in wild animals.

1. **Authority**: Roman law, continental treatises (Pufendorf, Barbeyrac), English sources (Justinian's Institutes, Fleta, Bracton) all favor capture over pursuit
2. **Certainty rationale**: Bright-line rule (capture) reduces litigation and conflict; pursuit-based rule would create endless disputes over whether pursuit was "close enough". Would reduce investment.
3. **Mortal wounding exception**: Dicta suggests mortal wounding + continued pursuit can suffice (animal no longer at liberty)
4. **No legal remedy without property**: Pierson may have acted badly, but without a property right in Post, no legal claim exists

3 step test: 

1. manifests intent to get the animal
2. 
3. brought animal into person's control

**Disposition:** Judgment for Post reversed

**Dissent (Livingston, J.)**

1. **Bottom line**: Would hold for Post
2. **Rule**: Pursuit by hunter with reasonable prospect of capture should create protected interest, at least against malicious interference
3. **Rationale**:
   - Encourages socially useful activity (eliminating noxious animals)
   - Fairness to laboring pursuer.
   - Hunter custom supports pursuit-based rights
   - Majority rule invites "unmanly" and "unchristian" conduct (Pierson's interference)
   - If one can swoop in, who would invest in the labor of the case?

### Keeble v. Hickeringill, (Q.B. 1707)

**Rule of Law**
Intentional interference with another's trade or livelihood (even absent property right) can be actionable tort.

**Facts + Procedural Posture**

1. Plaintiff operates decoy pond to attract wildfowl for capture
2. Defendant fires guns to scare away birds, intending to harm plaintiff's business
3. Case continues beyond assigned pages (setup only on p. 61)

**Issue**
Is malicious interference with another's profit-generating activity actionable even without trespass or property violation?

**Holding & Reasoning**
(Not fully in assigned pages, but context suggests:)
**Yes.** Action on the case lies for malicious interference with trade/livelihood. Defendant's intent to harm plaintiff's business, not mere competition, distinguishes this from *Pierson*.

**Distinction from Pierson**: *Pierson* involves rival claimants to a resource. *Keeble* involves intentional disruption of a business operation. Interference torts protect economic interests even where property rights are unclear.

### Ghen v. Rich, 8 F. 159 (D. Mass. 1881)

**Rule of Law**
Industry custom can create property rights when (1) longstanding and universal, (2) the only practical means of appropriation, and (3) necessary to sustain the industry.

**Facts + Procedural Posture**

1. Fin-back whalers off Cape Cod use bomb-lances; whales sink and later float
2. Industry custom: killer (identifiable by lance) owns the whale; finders notify killer and receive modest salvage
3. Plaintiff kills whale; it later washes ashore; finder sells to defendant (who processes it)
4. Plaintiff sues for value of oil

**Issue**
Does industry custom give the killer property rights in a whale not yet physically recovered?

**Holding & Reasoning**
**Yes.** Custom recognized; plaintiff owns the whale.

1. **Longstanding, universal practice**: Whaling community universally follows this custom
2. **Practical necessity**: Fin-back whales sink; physical recovery is delayed/uncertain. Requiring immediate physical possession would make whaling impossible
3. **Industry-sustaining**: Without legal support, killers would have no protection from opportunistic finders → industry collapses
4. **Salvage incentive**: Custom includes payment to finders, encouraging reporting and recovery
5. **Limited scope**: Custom applies only within the specific industry and context

**Disposition:** Plaintiff (killer) recovers value of oil minus processing costs

## POLICY / THEORY

### Thesis (1–2 sentences)

First possession rules coordinate behavior by creating clear, public signals of ownership. The trade-off is between bright-line rules (certainty, low information costs) and context-sensitive standards (fairness, custom, desert).

### Arguments professor rewards

**1. Coordination and information costs**

- First possession creates salient focal points that reduce conflict
- Bright-line rules (capture) minimize information costs—anyone can observe them
- Trade-off: bright-line rules sometimes sacrifice fairness (Pierson's "swoop") for systemic benefits

**2. Lockean labor-desert justification**

- Mixing labor with unowned resources creates property (Locke, Second Treatise § 27)
- Qualification: "Enough and as good" left for others; no waste/spoilage
- Critique: Why does labor create ownership rather than just a claim to compensation? And whose labor—Post's pursuit or Pierson's killing?

**3. Custom as efficient private ordering**

- Close-knit communities generate wealth-maximizing norms (whaling custom in *Ghen*)
- Custom economizes on information (insiders all know the rules)
- Problem: custom can bind outsiders without notice; can be oppressive or exclusionary

**4. Race-to-capture inefficiency**

- First-in-time rules can cause wasteful races (too-early investment, duplicative effort)
- Example: Oklahoma Land Rush, overfishing, patent races
- But: pursuit-based rules cause MORE conflict and uncertainty, not less

**5. Possession as communication**

- Possession signals "This is mine" to rivals and the public
- Audience matters: hunters understand pursuit; general public understands capture
- Trade-off between context-sensitive (custom) and universal (capture) signals

### Strong critiques / counterframes

**1. First possession rewards speed/force, not desert**

- Pierson did less labor than Post but wins under capture rule
- Counterpoint: Law prioritizes certainty over individual fairness. Ex ante, everyone knows the rule and can plan accordingly.

**2. Custom is parochial and exclusionary**

- Custom can reflect power dynamics, not efficiency (*Ghen* doesn't address whether whaling conservation is socially optimal)
- Binding outsiders to insiders' norms is coercive
- Counterpoint: Custom economizes on information costs within industries; courts can reject customs that harm outsiders disproportionately

**3. First possession encourages premature/excessive exploitation**

- "Tragedy of the commons" applies when no one has secure rights
- First possession rule can accelerate depletion (race to capture before others do)
- Counterpoint: Without first possession, no one has incentive to invest. Better to have clear property rights (even if wasteful races occur) than perpetual uncertainty.

**4. Labor theory is indeterminate**

- Post's pursuit or Pierson's kill—which is the relevant "labor"?
- Locke's provisos (enough and as good; no waste) are often violated
- Counterpoint: Labor theory is a justification, not a decision rule. Courts use bright-line rules (capture) for administrability.

### Exam-ready paragraph starters

**When arguing for bright-line rules (capture)**:
"Courts favor bright-line rules over context-sensitive standards because they reduce information costs and coordinate behavior ex ante. In *Pierson*, requiring actual capture sacrifices fairness to Post but creates a clear rule that minimizes disputes. The alternative—rewarding pursuit or 'near capture'—would generate endless litigation over how close is close enough."

**When arguing for custom-based rules**:
"Custom-based property rights are justified when they represent longstanding, universal industry practice that is the only feasible means of appropriation. *Ghen*'s whaling custom met this test: fin-back whales sink, making immediate physical recovery impossible, and the custom sustained the industry while incentivizing reporting through salvage. Courts should recognize custom where it solves practical appropriation problems and doesn't disproportionately harm outsiders."

**When arguing Lockean labor-desert**:
"Locke's labor theory justifies first possession as rewarding productive labor mixed with unowned resources. Post's extended pursuit—tracking the fox, deploying hounds—created value and should ground a property claim. But the dissent's position is difficult to administer: how much labor is enough? The majority opts for a bright-line rule that sacrifices individual desert for systemic clarity."

**When critiquing first possession as wasteful**:
"First-in-time rules can cause socially wasteful races to capture. If multiple parties compete to be first, they may over-invest in speed/force rather than productive use. The Oklahoma Land Rush exemplifies this: settlers raced to stake claims, sometimes arriving too early and investing prematurely. A better system might allocate rights by lottery or auction to avoid races."

## QUICK HYPOS (≥5)

### Hypo 1

**Facts:** A mortally wounds a deer with a rifle shot; deer runs 100 yards and collapses. Before A reaches the deer, B arrives, tags the deer, and claims it.

**Issue:** Does mortal wounding + continued pursuit give A a property right?

**Analysis:**

- **A's argument**: Mortal wounding + pursuit = capture under *Pierson* dicta (animal no longer at liberty). A created the value; B is an opportunistic interloper.
- **B's argument**: Bright-line rule requires actual possession. Until A physically possesses the deer, it remains unowned. B's act of tagging is capture.

**Most likely professor move:** "What's the difference between this and *Pierson*? Why is mortal wounding special?" Answer: Mortal wounding removes the animal's liberty (no real chance of escape), so it's functionally equivalent to capture.

---

### Hypo 2

**Facts:** Rancher leaves cattle to graze on open range (unenclosed public land). Stranger finds unbranded calf and brands it with their own mark.

**Issue:** Does rancher have property right in unbranded calf on open range?

**Analysis:**

- **Rancher's argument**: Cattle are domesticated, not wild. Rancher has possession of the herd; calf is part of herd (accession). Open range grazing is customary; branding is the recognized signal of ownership.
- **Stranger's argument**: Unbranded calf on open range is functionally wild/unowned. First to brand has superior claim.

**Most likely professor move:** "Is this first possession or something else?" Answer: It's accession (calf belongs to owner of mother cow) + custom (open range custom gives ranchers constructive possession). But if calf is orphaned/separated long enough, might be treated as abandoned.

---

### Hypo 3

**Facts:** Hunter uses dogs to tree a raccoon (raccoon climbs tree to escape). Before hunter shoots, rival hunter arrives and shoots the raccoon.

**Issue:** Does treeing the animal count as capture?

**Analysis:**

- **First hunter**: Animal is confined/controlled (can't escape while in tree). This is functional capture, like trapping.
- **Rival hunter**: Animal is still at liberty (could climb down or jump). No physical possession until shot/killed.

**Most likely professor move:** "Is this like *Pierson* or different?" Answer: Arguably different—raccoon's escape is limited by being treed. But it's not fully deprived of liberty (could still escape). Courts would likely favor the actual killer (clearer signal of possession).

---

### Hypo 4

**Facts:** Commercial fishermen in a specific region have a long-standing custom: if one boat's net breaks and fish escape, other boats must not catch those fish for 24 hours (to allow the first boat to repair and recover). Outsider boat catches the fish immediately.

**Issue:** Should courts recognize this custom as creating property rights?

**Analysis:**

- **Fishermen's argument**: *Ghen* framework applies—longstanding, universal within the community, necessary to sustain cooperation and prevent opportunism.
- **Outsider's argument**: Custom is parochial and unknown to outsiders. Fish are fugitive resources; capture is the only recognized rule. Binding outsiders to a local custom they don't know is unfair.

**Most likely professor move:** "When does custom bind non-participants?" Answer: *Ghen* requires not just industry-wide practice but also practical necessity (the only feasible method). Here, the custom is about cooperation, not necessity—ordinary capture rules work fine. Also, outsider lacks notice. Likely reject the custom.

---

### Hypo 5

**Facts:** Two companies race to develop a new drug. Company A is 90% done with clinical trials. Company B, knowing this, accelerates its own trials and gets FDA approval first.

**Issue:** Does first possession apply to intangible resources? Does A have any claim?

**Analysis:**

- **A's argument**: A's labor and investment created the value. B's interference is like Pierson swooping in.
- **B's argument**: Patent law governs intangibles, not first possession. Patent goes to first to file (or first to invent under old law), not first to be "close." B's conduct is lawful competition.

**Most likely professor move:** "Is this a property problem or a patent problem?" Answer: Property law generally doesn't extend to intangibles unless codified (patent, copyright). First possession is about physical resources. But the intuition is similar—bright-line rule (first to file) vs. equity to prior laborer (first to invent).

---

### Hypo 6

**Facts:** Beachcombers have a custom: whoever finds a message in a bottle owns it and any contents. Tourist finds bottle with $500 cash, keeps it. Original sender (who intentionally released the bottle as a "finders keepers" promotion) claims the custom doesn't apply to him.

**Issue:** Does the custom bind the original sender?

**Analysis:**

- **Beachcombers**: Custom is longstanding and universal among beachcombers. Sender intentionally abandoned the bottle (finders keepers). Custom gives clear rules.
- **Sender**: The sender intended the bottle for a specific promotional purpose, not to follow beachcomber custom. Sender retained ownership intent (promotional giveaway, not true abandonment).

**Most likely professor move:** "Is the bottle abandoned?" Answer: Probably yes—sender intentionally released it with finders-keepers intent. Custom is less relevant here; the issue is abandonment (voluntary relinquishment of ownership). If abandoned, first finder owns it.
