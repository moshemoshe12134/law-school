## CORE DOCTRINE

### Rule statements (copy-ready)

**Finder's rights (general rule)**: A finder of personal property has title good against all the world except the true owner. Possession is title as against anyone who cannot show prior right. *Armory v. Delamirie*, 93 Eng. Rep. 664 (K.B. 1722).

**Found property categories**:
1. **Abandoned**: Owner voluntarily relinquishes all rights. First finder becomes true owner.
2. **Lost**: Owner unintentionally parts with possession. Finder beats everyone except true owner.
3. **Mislaid**: Owner intentionally places property somewhere and forgets. Possessor of premises (not finder) holds for true owner.
4. **Treasure trove** (archaic): Hidden gold/silver/currency from long ago. Traditionally belongs to finder.

**Landowner vs. finder**: If object is attached to or under the land, landowner has superior claim. If object is lying loose on land, finder has superior claim unless landowner had manifest intention to exercise control over all objects on premises. *Hannah v. Peel*, 1 K.B. 509 (1945).

**Trespasser/wrongdoer rule**: A trespassing finder has no rights against the landowner or true owner. Wrongdoers should not benefit from their wrongdoing.

**Employee finder rule**: Property found by an employee within the scope of employment belongs to the employer.

---

**Riparian rights rule**: Owners of land abutting a watercourse have the right to reasonable use of the water. Under the natural flow doctrine, any diminution of water is prima facie wrongful; under the reasonable use doctrine, uses are balanced considering purpose, extent of harm, and practicality of alternatives. *Evans v. Merriweather*, 4 Ill. 492 (1842).

**Prior appropriation rule**: "First in time, first in right." The first person to divert water and apply it to beneficial use has priority over later appropriators. Rights are not tied to land ownership. Must put water to beneficial use or risk forfeiture. *Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Co.*, 6 Colo. 443 (1882).

---

### Elements breakdown

**1. Finder's superior claim (Armory)**
   - **Elements**:
     - Actual possession (physical control)
     - No one with prior/superior right appears
   - **Effect**: Finder can sue third parties for conversion/damage
   - **Limitation**: True owner can always reclaim

**2. Lost vs. mislaid distinction**
   - **Lost**: Unintentional, unknowing parting with possession
     - Rule: Finder beats landowner
     - Rationale: True owner unlikely to remember where lost
   - **Mislaid**: Intentional placement + forgetting
     - Rule: Landowner/premises possessor beats finder
     - Rationale: True owner more likely to return to where they left it

**3. Landowner's constructive possession**
   - **Elements**:
     - Object is **in/under** the land (attached) OR
     - Owner manifested intent to exercise control over all objects on premises
   - **Effect**: Landowner has constructive possession, beats finder
   - **Limitation**: Landowner must actually intend/exercise control; mere ownership of premises insufficient for loose objects

**4. Prior appropriation (Western water rights)**
   - **Elements**:
     - Diversion from natural watercourse
     - Application to beneficial use (irrigation, mining, municipal, industrial)
     - Compliance with state permit/recording system
   - **Priority**: Determined by date of appropriation (first in time = senior right)
   - **Forfeiture**: "Use it or lose it"—non-use can result in loss of right

**5. Riparian rights (Eastern water rights)**
   - **Elements**:
     - Land must abut the watercourse (riparian land)
     - Use must be reasonable (modern rule)
   - **Priority**: No seniority; all riparians have equal rights subject to reasonableness
   - **Limitation**: Cannot transport water away from watershed (generally)

### Common traps (what professor punishes)

- **Confusing lost vs. mislaid**: Lost = unintentional; mislaid = intentional placement + forgetting
- **Assuming landowner always wins**: Landowner wins for attached/buried objects, but NOT for loose objects absent manifest intent to control
- **Forgetting relativity of title**: Even a thief/wrongdoer can sue a subsequent taker (Armory principle)
- **Conflating riparian and prior appropriation**: These are geographically separate systems with opposite logics (equal/reasonable vs. seniority/priority)
- **Thinking prior appropriation is prescriptive**: It's not adverse possession of water—it's a legal method of acquiring rights, not a hostile/wrongful one
- **Assuming beneficial use is flexible**: "Beneficial use" is defined by state law and usually excludes waste/speculation

## EXPECTED PROFESSOR QUESTIONS (Q→A)

### "Big picture" questions

**Q:** Why does the finder in *Armory* have any rights at all? He's probably a thief—why can he sue the goldsmith?

**A:** Property rights are relative, not absolute. As between the finder and the goldsmith, the finder has superior possession. The true owner could sue both, but as between two wrongdoers, the first possessor wins. This rule creates incentives: it encourages finders to come forward (they get protection against the world minus true owner) and discourages subsequent takers from stealing from finders.

**Likely pushback:** "But doesn't that reward thieves?"

**Response:** It does reward the first possessor, but it prevents a worse outcome—endless chains of taking. If the goldsmith could take from the finder with impunity, anyone could take from anyone. The rule stops the chain at the first possessor and reserves rights only for the true owner.

---

**Q:** What's the point of the lost/mislaid distinction? Isn't it just a guessing game about the true owner's mental state?

**A:** The distinction is about optimizing return to the true owner. If property is mislaid (intentionally placed), the owner is more likely to retrace steps and return to that location. Giving the premises owner possession ensures the property stays put. If property is lost (unintentionally), the owner has no idea where it is, so giving the finder possession doesn't disadvantage the true owner and rewards the honest finder.

**Counterargument:** The distinction is arbitrary and difficult to apply. Courts have to guess the true owner's intent based on where the property was found. Modern statutes often replace this with a unified "turn it over to police and wait" rule.

**How to resolve on an exam:** Apply the traditional rule (intentional placement = mislaid, owner of premises wins; unintentional = lost, finder wins) but note the arbitrariness and the trend toward statutory solutions.

---

**Q:** Why does *Hannah v. Peel* favor the finder over the landowner? Doesn't the landowner "own" everything on their property?

**A:** Ownership of land gives constructive possession of things **attached to or under** the land, but not automatically to loose objects lying on the surface. The landowner must manifest intent to exercise control over such objects. Peel never occupied the house, never knew about the brooch, and never asserted control over objects in the house. Hannah, by finding and taking possession, has superior claim.

**Likely pushback:** "But it's Peel's house—shouldn't he have the right to everything in it?"

**Response:** Only if he actually exercises control. If landowners automatically won for all loose objects, it would discourage honest finding and reporting. The rule balances: landowner wins for embedded/attached (where control is assumed) but loses for loose objects unless they manifest intent to control.

---

**Q:** Why did the Western U.S. reject riparian rights in favor of prior appropriation?

**A:** Arid climate + economic development. In the West, water is scarce and valuable. Riparian rights tie water to land ownership along streams, which is inefficient if the best use (mining, irrigation) is far from the stream. Prior appropriation allows anyone to divert water and use it productively wherever needed. "First in time" creates secure property rights that encourage investment (dams, canals, irrigation infrastructure).

**Likely pushback:** "But doesn't prior appropriation lock in early users and prevent adaptation to new needs?"

**Response:** Yes, that's a cost. Senior appropriators can block juniors even if juniors have higher-value uses. But priority provides certainty and protects investment. Without seniority, no one would invest in infrastructure (someone could always divert upstream and cut you off). Trade-off: certainty/investment vs. flexibility/efficiency.

---

**Q:** Is prior appropriation really "first possession" or is it something different?

**A:** It's first possession applied to a fugitive resource. The act of diversion + application to beneficial use is the "capture" equivalent for water. Like Pierson's fox, the first to appropriate (capture) gets priority. But unlike a fox (which stays captured), water is continuously flowing, so the right is ongoing—senior appropriators continuously have priority.

**Likely pushback:** "But you can't really 'possess' water—it's always moving."

**Response:** True, which is why appropriation creates a priority right (an entitlement to divert a certain amount) rather than ownership of specific water molecules. It's a usufructuary right (right to use), not ownership.

---

### Doctrine parsing questions

**Q:** If I find a watch in a public park, who owns it—me or the city?

**A:** Under *Armory*, the finder (you) has title good against everyone except the true owner. The city, as landowner, might argue it has constructive possession, but parks are public and the city doesn't manifest intent to control all lost objects (people lose things constantly). Most courts would favor the finder.

**Counterargument:** If the city has a policy of holding found property for true owners (and signs posted to that effect), the city might have superior claim (manifest intent to control).

**How to resolve:** Apply *Hannah* factors: Did the landowner (city) manifest intent to exercise control? If yes (policy/signs), city wins. If no, finder wins.

---

**Q:** What if I find money buried in my backyard while digging a pool—who owns it?

**A:** Landowner (you). Objects buried/embedded in land belong to the landowner (constructive possession extends below the surface). Exception: treasure trove (historically gave finder the right to buried gold/silver), but most states have abolished treasure trove.

**Likely pushback:** "What if the previous owner buried it?"

**Response:** Unless the previous owner can prove they retained ownership (didn't abandon it), the current landowner owns it. Buried objects are part of the land.

---

**Q:** If I'm a trespasser and I find property, can I keep it?

**A:** No. Courts generally hold that wrongdoers (trespassers) forfeit finder's rights. The landowner has superior claim, even if the object is "lost" rather than attached to land.

**Rationale:** Don't reward wrongdoing. If trespassers could claim found property, it would incentivize trespassing.

---

**Q:** I'm a riparian landowner in New York. My upstream neighbor builds a dam that reduces my water flow by 20%. Do I have a claim?

**A:** Under natural flow doctrine (*Evans*), yes—any diminution is prima facie wrongful. Under modern reasonable use doctrine (which New York likely follows), it depends: Is the upstream use reasonable? Factors include purpose (domestic use often trumps), extent of harm, practicality of alternatives. If the dam serves a reasonable purpose and doesn't unreasonably harm you, no claim.

**Likely pushback:** "But I own the riparian land—don't I have an absolute right to water?"

**Response:** No. All riparians have co-equal rights subject to reasonableness. It's a sharing regime, not an absolute ownership regime.

---

**Q:** I was the first to appropriate water from a stream in Colorado in 1950 (senior appropriator). New junior appropriator started using in 2020. During drought, is there enough for both of us?

**A:** You (senior) have absolute priority. If there's not enough water for both, junior gets zero and you get your full appropriated amount. "First in time, first in right."

**Likely pushback:** "Isn't that inefficient if junior has a higher-value use?"

**Response:** Yes, possibly. But prior appropriation prioritizes certainty and investment-backed expectations over optimal allocation. Junior should have investigated seniority before investing. Some states allow water markets (juniors can buy from seniors), which can improve efficiency.

## CASE BRIEFS

### Armory v. Delamirie, 93 Eng. Rep. 664 (K.B. 1722)

**Rule of Law**
A finder has title good against all the world except the true owner. Possession is title as against anyone who cannot show prior right.

**Facts + Procedural Posture**
1. Chimney sweep boy finds jewel
2. Takes it to goldsmith for appraisal
3. Goldsmith's apprentice removes stones and refuses to return them
4. Boy sues in trover (conversion)

**Issue**
Does a finder have a property right sufficient to recover against a third party who takes the property from the finder?

**Holding & Reasoning**
### (Court)
**Yes.** Finder has superior title as against all but the true owner.

1. **Relativity of title**: Property rights are relative. Finder's possession is good against the world except the true owner
2. **First possession principle**: Even if the finder is a wrongdoer (possible thief), as between finder and a subsequent taker, the finder has superior right
3. **Presumption against wrongdoer**: Where defendant wrongfully refuses to return property, damages are measured by the highest possible value (presumed against the wrongdoer)

**Disposition:** Judgment for plaintiff (finder)

**Key takeaway**: The rule prevents endless taking. If anyone could take from a finder, there would be no security of possession. By protecting the finder against all but the true owner, the law encourages finding and reporting.

### Hannah v. Peel, 1 K.B. 509 (1945)

**Rule of Law**
A finder of an unattached object has superior title over the landowner unless the landowner manifested intent to exercise control over all objects on the premises.

**Facts + Procedural Posture**
1. Peel owns house, never occupied it (requisitioned by military during WWII)
2. Hannah, soldier billeted there, finds brooch on top of window frame
3. Hannah turns it over to police; after 2 years unclaimed, police give it to Peel
4. Hannah sues Peel for the brooch or its value

**Issue**
As between finder and landowner, who has superior title to found personal property?

**Holding & Reasoning**
### (Birkett, J.)
**Finder wins** (Hannah).

1. **Attached vs. unattached**: Objects attached to or under land belong to landowner (constructive possession). Objects lying loose do not automatically belong to landowner
2. **Manifest intent to control**: Landowner wins only if they manifested intention to exercise control over all things on premises
   - Peel never occupied house
   - No knowledge of or control over the brooch
   - No evidence of intent to exercise control over objects in house
3. **Finder's possession**: Hannah took actual possession, giving him superior claim
4. **Distinguish from embedded objects**: If the brooch had been hidden in a wall or under a floorboard, result might differ (landowner's constructive possession extends to embedded objects)

**Disposition:** Judgment for plaintiff (Hannah)

**Key takeaway**: Landowner's constructive possession is not automatic for all loose objects. Actual intent to control matters.

---

### Evans v. Merriweather, 4 Ill. 492 (1842)

**Rule of Law**
Under the natural flow doctrine, every riparian owner has the right to have water flow in its natural state (quantity and quality). Any diminution is prima facie wrongful.

**Facts + Procedural Posture**
1. Upstream landowner constructs dam
2. Dam reduces water flow to downstream mill owner
3. Downstream owner sues

**Issue**
Does a riparian owner have the right to natural flow of water, even if the upstream use is reasonable and beneficial?

**Holding & Reasoning**
### (Court)
**Yes.** Natural flow doctrine protects each riparian's right to undiminished water.

1. **Equal rights among riparians**: All riparian owners have co-equal rights to natural flow
2. **Any diminution is wrongful**: Even if the upstream use is valuable/productive, reducing flow to downstream users is a prima facie violation of their rights
3. **No balancing**: Court does not weigh reasonableness of uses (strict rule)

**Disposition:** Judgment for plaintiff (downstream owner)

**Key takeaway**: Natural flow doctrine is rigid—protects existing flow regardless of competing uses. Modern trend is toward reasonable use (balancing), which allows more flexibility.

### Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Co., 6 Colo. 443 (1882)

**Rule of Law**
In arid regions, prior appropriation governs water rights: "first in time, first in right." Anyone can appropriate water by diverting and applying to beneficial use, regardless of land ownership.

**Facts + Procedural Posture**
1. Plaintiffs (Coffin et al.) are riparian landowners who divert water from creek for irrigation
2. Defendants (Left Hand Ditch Co.) are non-riparian appropriators who built ditch years earlier to divert water for mining/agriculture elsewhere
3. Plaintiffs sue claiming riparian rights, seeking to enjoin defendants' diversion

**Issue**
Does riparian doctrine or prior appropriation govern water rights in Colorado?

**Holding & Reasoning**
### (Court)
**Prior appropriation governs.** Defendants' earlier appropriation beats plaintiffs' riparian claim.

1. **Rejection of riparian rights**: Riparian doctrine unsuited to arid regions. Water is too scarce and valuable to lock it to land along streams
2. **Economic development rationale**: Best uses of water (mining, irrigation) often far from streams. Prior appropriation allows diversion to wherever water is most productive
3. **Priority in time**: First to appropriate gets priority. Defendants' earlier diversion (pre-dating plaintiffs' use) gives them superior right
4. **Beneficial use requirement**: Appropriators must put water to productive use. Can't just claim water abstractly
5. **Encourages investment**: Priority protects early appropriators, encouraging investment in infrastructure (ditches, canals, dams)

**Disposition:** Judgment for defendants (prior appropriators)

**Key takeaway**: Prior appropriation is a first-possession rule adapted to fugitive resources in conditions of scarcity. Priority (first in time) trumps land ownership (riparian status).

## POLICY / THEORY

### Thesis (1–2 sentences)
Found property rules balance competing interests: incentivizing honest finders, protecting true owners, and respecting landowners' dominion. Water rights systems reflect regional scarcity: riparian rights (equal sharing) suit abundant water regions; prior appropriation (first in time) suits arid regions where investment/priority are necessary.

### Arguments professor rewards

**1. Relativity of title encourages productive behavior**
- *Armory* rule incentivizes finders to report and hold property for true owners (rather than hiding it or abandoning it)
- Protects finders against third-party thieves, creating security of possession
- Prevents endless chains of taking (first possessor is protected; true owner can always reclaim)

**2. Lost/mislaid distinction optimizes return to true owner**
- Mislaid property stays where owner left it (premises owner holds), increasing likelihood of recovery when owner retraces steps
- Lost property goes to finder because true owner has no memory of location (no advantage to keeping it at the premises)
- Trade-off: distinction is hard to apply (requires guessing owner's intent)

**3. Landowner constructive possession protects investment in land**
- Objects embedded in or attached to land belong to landowner (reduces transaction costs; landowner would have to negotiate with finders otherwise)
- But constructive possession doesn't extend to all loose objects (that would discourage honest finding and create windfalls for landowners)
- "Manifest intent to control" test balances: landowner who actively asserts control wins; passive landowner loses to finder

**4. Prior appropriation matches institutional solution to scarcity**
- Arid West: water is scarce, riparian doctrine would lock water to streamside land (inefficient)
- Prior appropriation allows diversion to highest-value uses (wherever located)
- Priority incentivizes investment: ditches, dams, irrigation infrastructure are expensive; without secure priority, no one would invest (upstream users could always cut you off)
- "Use it or lose it" prevents hoarding/speculation

**5. Riparian rights work in abundance contexts**
- Eastern U.S.: water is plentiful, scarcity is rare
- Equal sharing (reasonable use) allows all riparians to access water without races or priority fights
- Flexibility: balancing test adapts to changing conditions (drought, new uses)

### Strong critiques / counterframes

**1. Found property categories are arbitrary and manipulable**
- Lost vs. mislaid requires courts to guess owner's mental state (intentional placement vs. accidental loss)
- Courts can manipulate the label to reach desired results (favor finder or landowner depending on equities)
- Modern statutes often replace categories with uniform "turn it over and wait" rule
- Counterpoint: Categories provide rough guidance; bright-line rules would be worse (e.g., "landowner always wins" would discourage reporting)

**2. Relativity of title rewards thieves**
- *Armory* allows a probable thief (chimney sweep) to sue and recover against a third party
- Seems to incentivize theft (you can steal something and then sue anyone who takes it from you except the true owner)
- Counterpoint: The alternative is worse. If the goldsmith can take with impunity, everyone can take from everyone. Stopping the chain at the first possessor creates relative security.

**3. Landowner vs. finder rules are unpredictable**
- "Manifest intent to control" is vague and fact-specific. Landowners don't know whether they'll win or lose.
- Creates litigation over every found object
- Counterpoint: Bright-line rule (landowner always wins or finder always wins) would create other problems. Landowner-always-wins discourages reporting; finder-always-wins undermines landowner's dominion.

**4. Prior appropriation is inflexible and creates inefficient lock-in**
- Senior appropriators can block higher-value uses by juniors
- Prevents adaptation to climate change, population growth, changing needs
- Example: 19th-century mining appropriation still has priority over 21st-century municipal/environmental uses
- Counterpoint: Flexibility comes at cost of uncertainty. If priority could be overridden, no one would invest in infrastructure. Some states allow water markets (buy/sell rights) to improve efficiency while preserving priority.

**5. Prior appropriation encourages overuse/waste**
- "Use it or lose it" incentivizes consuming full appropriated amount even when not needed (to avoid forfeiture)
- Result: inefficient use, resistance to conservation
- Counterpoint: Beneficial use requirement limits waste; forfeiture only occurs after prolonged non-use; some states allow temporary non-use without forfeiture.

**6. Riparian reasonable use is too vague**
- "Reasonableness" balancing is unpredictable and litigation-intensive
- Doesn't create secure investment expectations (today's reasonable use might be tomorrow's unreasonable use)
- Counterpoint: Flexibility is a feature, not a bug. Rigid rules (natural flow) prevent productive uses. Balancing adapts to context.

### Exam-ready paragraph starters

**When arguing for finder's rights**:
"The finder has superior title under *Armory* because property rights are relative. As between the finder and a third-party taker, the finder has prior possession and thus superior right. This rule incentivizes honest finding and holding for the true owner, while preventing endless chains of taking. The true owner can always reclaim, but as between wrongdoers, the first possessor wins."

**When arguing for landowner over finder**:
"The landowner has superior claim under *Hannah v. Peel* because the object was embedded in / attached to the land, giving the landowner constructive possession. [Alternative: The landowner manifested intent to exercise control over all objects on the premises by [specific acts], giving constructive possession even for loose objects.] Landowners should not have to negotiate with every finder for objects in/on their property."

**When distinguishing lost vs. mislaid**:
"This is mislaid property because the true owner intentionally placed it [on the counter / in the drawer] and then forgot it. The owner is likely to retrace steps and return to the location. Therefore, the premises owner (not the finder) should hold the property to maximize the chance of return to the true owner. [For lost:] This is lost property because the owner unintentionally parted with possession and has no memory of where it is. Giving the finder possession rewards honest finding without disadvantaging the true owner."

**When arguing for prior appropriation**:
"Prior appropriation governs in [western state] under *Coffin*. First in time, first in right: the senior appropriator has absolute priority over juniors, especially in times of scarcity. This rule incentivizes investment in infrastructure (ditches, dams) by protecting early users. The beneficial use requirement prevents hoarding, and the priority system provides certainty that enables long-term planning. The trade-off is inflexibility, but water markets can allow efficiency-improving transfers while preserving seniority."

**When arguing for riparian rights**:
"Riparian rights apply in [eastern state]. All riparian owners have co-equal rights to reasonable use of the water. Reasonableness balancing considers purpose (domestic use typically prevails), extent of harm, and practicality of alternatives. No party has absolute priority; all must share. This system works where water is relatively abundant and flexibility is more important than rigid priority."

## QUICK HYPOS (≥5)

### Hypo 1
**Facts:** Customer in a coffee shop finds a wallet under a table. Customer takes it to the shop owner, who holds it for 60 days. True owner never appears. Customer and shop owner both claim the wallet.

**Issue:** Is the wallet lost or mislaid? Who wins—finder or shop owner?

**Analysis:**
- **Finder's argument**: Wallet is **lost** (unintentional). Customer didn't place it under the table and forget—someone accidentally dropped it. Under lost property rules, finder beats shop owner.
- **Shop owner's argument**: Wallet is **mislaid** (intentional placement + forgetting). Person likely put wallet down (e.g., while getting napkins) and forgot it. Owner likely to return to shop to look for it. Under mislaid property rules, premises owner (shop) beats finder.

**Most likely professor move:** "How do you know whether the person intentionally put it down or accidentally dropped it?" Answer: You don't—courts infer from location/circumstances. Wallet under table suggests dropping (lost); wallet on counter suggests placement (mislaid). But the distinction is manipulable.

---

### Hypo 2
**Facts:** Homeowner hires plumber to fix pipes in basement. Plumber finds cash hidden behind a pipe. Homeowner and plumber both claim it.

**Issue:** Does the employee (plumber) or the landowner (homeowner) have superior claim?

**Analysis:**
- **Plumber's argument**: Finder's rule (*Armory*). Plumber found it, plumber has superior claim as against everyone except true owner.
- **Homeowner's argument**: Employee-finder rule. Plumber was acting within scope of employment (hired to work in basement). Employers get benefits of employees' labor, including found property. Also, cash was embedded/hidden in wall (behind pipe), so landowner has constructive possession of embedded objects.

**Most likely professor move:** "Is this an employment relationship?" Answer: Arguably no—plumber is an independent contractor, not an employee. But courts sometimes extend the rule to contractors working on the premises. Stronger argument: cash was embedded (behind pipe), so landowner wins under *Hannah* (embedded objects belong to landowner).

---

### Hypo 3
**Facts:** Trespasser cuts across private land to get to a lake. Finds expensive ring on the ground. Landowner claims the ring.

**Issue:** Does trespasser-finder have any rights?

**Analysis:**
- **Trespasser's argument**: *Armory* rule—finder has title good against all but true owner.
- **Landowner's argument**: Wrongdoers forfeit finder's rights. Trespasser should not benefit from trespass. Also, even if not a wrongdoer, landowner has superior claim under *Hannah* (landowner has constructive possession of land; if land is private and controlled, landowner likely manifested intent to control objects on it).

**Most likely professor move:** "Does it matter how the trespasser found it—accidentally or by searching?" Answer: Probably not. Trespass is wrongful regardless. Courts generally deny finder's rights to trespassers to avoid incentivizing trespass.

---

### Hypo 4
**Facts:** Senior water appropriator in Idaho (appropriated in 1950) uses water for alfalfa farming. Junior appropriator (appropriated in 2020) wants to use water for semiconductor manufacturing (much higher value). Drought: not enough water for both.

**Issue:** Who gets the water? Should courts reallocate based on higher value use?

**Analysis:**
- **Senior's argument**: "First in time, first in right." Prior appropriation gives absolute priority to seniors. Junior gets zero if there's insufficient water. This rule protects investment-backed expectations and provides certainty.
- **Junior's argument**: Semiconductor manufacturing is higher-value use (economically and socially). Courts should reallocate water to maximize social welfare. Alfalfa farming in a desert is wasteful.

**Most likely professor move:** "Is this efficient? Should law allow highest-value user to win?" Answer: Prior appropriation prioritizes certainty/investment over optimal allocation. But some states allow water markets—junior can buy senior's right (voluntary transfer). Courts generally won't reallocate involuntarily because it would undermine priority system and chill investment.

---

### Hypo 5
**Facts:** Riparian landowner in Vermont diverts 50% of stream flow for bottling/selling commercially. Downstream riparian's mill loses power due to reduced flow.

**Issue:** Is commercial bottling/selling a reasonable use under riparian doctrine?

**Analysis:**
- **Upstream (bottler) argument**: Riparian doctrine allows reasonable use. Bottling is productive and economically valuable. Upstream hasn't eliminated flow, just reduced it.
- **Downstream (mill) argument**: Reasonable use doctrine requires balancing. Factors against upstream: (1) non-traditional use (bottling/selling water off the land may violate the rule against transporting water outside the watershed); (2) extent of harm is severe (50% reduction cripples mill); (3) purpose: downstream use (industrial) is arguably equivalent to or higher priority than bottling.

**Most likely professor move:** "Can you sell water commercially under riparian rights?" Answer: Traditional rule says no—riparian rights are tied to beneficial use on riparian land, and transporting water away from the watershed violates the usufructuary nature of riparian rights. Some states allow it with permits, but classical riparian doctrine would likely prohibit large-scale commercial export.

---

### Hypo 6
**Facts:** Landowner in Montana (prior appropriation state) diverts water for irrigation, uses it, and the runoff returns to the stream. Junior appropriator 10 miles downstream has relied on this return flow for 20 years. Senior wants to switch to more efficient drip irrigation (no return flow).

**Issue:** Can senior appropriator change use in a way that eliminates return flows that juniors have relied on?

**Analysis:**
- **Senior's argument**: It's my water right. I can use it however I want as long as I don't exceed my appropriated amount. Switching to efficient irrigation is beneficial (conserves water). Return flow was just a byproduct, not a legal obligation.
- **Junior's argument**: I have a vested right to the historical return flow. I've relied on it for 20 years, invested in infrastructure based on that flow. Senior's change of use harms me and should require compensation or permission.

**Most likely professor move:** "Who's right? Does senior have to maintain return flows?" Answer: Depends on state law, but general rule is that juniors have no legal right to return flows (they're not appropriated water). BUT, if juniors have relied on return flows for a long time, courts may impose a duty not to harm juniors by changing use (equitable estoppel or protective doctrine). Some states allow changes of use only if "no injury to other appropriators."

---

### Hypo 7
**Facts:** Tourist finds a gold coin on public beach. City (which owns the beach) claims it. Tourist argues it's lost property.

**Issue:** Is this lost property (finder wins) or does the city have superior claim as landowner?

**Analysis:**
- **Tourist (finder)**: Lost property. Finder beats everyone except true owner. City didn't manifest intent to control all objects on public beach (people lose things all the time).
- **City (landowner)**: City owns the beach (public trust). City has constructive possession of objects on city land. Alternatively, if city has a policy (e.g., signs saying "lost and found at city hall"), city manifested intent to control.

**Most likely professor move:** "Does it matter that it's a public beach?" Answer: Yes. Public lands are less likely to support landowner's claim (no manifest intent to control every lost object). But if the city has an explicit policy/signage, that might constitute manifest intent. Absent policy, finder likely wins.
