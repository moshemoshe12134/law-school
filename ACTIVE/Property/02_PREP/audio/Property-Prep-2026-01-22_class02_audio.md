# Audio Prep — Class #02 — Found Property and Water Rights

**Audio length: ~30 minutes | Listen before class on Wednesday, 2026-01-22**

---

## INTRO (2 minutes)

Welcome back. Today we're covering two extensions of first possession: found property and water rights.

Found property asks: if someone finds a lost ring or a wallet, who owns it—the finder or the landowner where it was found? This builds on first possession but adds complications: there's a true owner somewhere, and the finder might be on someone else's property.

Water rights asks: how do you allocate a fugitive resource—water flowing in a stream—when multiple people need it? We'll see two competing systems: riparian rights in the East and prior appropriation in the West.

By the end of this prep, you'll understand:
1. When finders have superior claims and when landowners do
2. The lost/mislaid/abandoned categories and why they matter
3. How riparian rights and prior appropriation differ and why geography drives the choice

The core theme: how property law adapts first possession principles to different contexts and constraints.

## PART 1: Armory v. Delamirie — Relativity of Title (6 minutes)

### The story

A chimney sweep boy finds a jewel. Takes it to a goldsmith to get it appraised. The goldsmith's apprentice removes the stones and refuses to return them. Boy sues.

Question: does a finder—who's probably a thief—have any legal rights?

Court says yes. The finder has title good against all the world except the true owner.

### The relativity principle

Property rights are relative, not absolute.

As between the finder and the goldsmith, the finder got there first. He has prior possession. That's enough to beat the goldsmith.

The true owner could sue both of them. But as between two wrongdoers, the first possessor wins.

### Why this rule makes sense

It prevents endless taking. If the goldsmith could take from the finder with impunity, then anyone could take from anyone. There'd be no security of possession.

By protecting the first possessor, the law creates a stable chain. The finder holds the property for the true owner. Third parties can't interfere.

Also, it incentivizes honest finding. Finders are protected against everyone but the true owner, so they're more likely to come forward rather than hide or abandon the property.

### The damages rule

Since the goldsmith acted wrongfully (refused to return the stones), damages are measured by the highest possible value of the jewel. Presumed against the wrongdoer.

This is a penalty rule—punishes the wrongdoer for not returning the property.

### What the professor will push on

"Isn't this rewarding a thief?"

Answer: yes, the finder might be a thief. But the alternative is worse. If anyone could take from the finder, there's no security. The rule stops the chain of taking at the first possessor and reserves rights for the true owner.

Or: "Why doesn't the goldsmith get to keep it since the finder's a wrongdoer?"

Answer: between two wrongdoers, the first possessor wins. That's a bright-line rule. The alternative would be endless litigation over who's more wrongful.

### Tiny hypo

Thief steals a bike. Locks it up. Someone else steals it from the thief. Original thief sues the second thief.

Under Armory, the first thief wins. As between two wrongdoers, prior possession prevails. The true owner could sue both, but as between the thieves, the first has superior right.

## PART 2: Hannah v. Peel — Finder vs. Landowner (7 minutes)

### The story

Peel owns a house. Never lived in it—it was requisitioned by the military during World War II. Hannah, a soldier billeted there, finds a brooch on top of a window frame. Turns it over to police. Two years later, no one claims it. Police give it to Peel. Hannah sues.

Question: finder or landowner?

Court says finder. Hannah wins.

### The distinction: attached vs. loose

If an object is attached to or under the land—buried, embedded in a wall, etc.—the landowner has constructive possession. Landowner wins.

If an object is lying loose on the surface, the finder has the better claim unless the landowner manifested intent to exercise control over all objects on the premises.

Here, the brooch was sitting on top of a window frame. Not attached, not embedded. Just lying there.

### Manifest intent to control

The key test: did the landowner manifest intent to exercise control?

Peel never occupied the house. Never knew about the brooch. Never asserted control over objects in the house.

No manifest intent, so no constructive possession. Hannah's actual possession beats Peel's non-existent constructive possession.

### Why this rule?

Balancing interests.

Landowners should own things that are part of the land—buried treasure, objects in the walls, etc. That's efficient (reduces transaction costs) and protects the landowner's investment in the property.

But landowners shouldn't automatically own every loose object on their property. That would discourage honest finding. And it would be a windfall for landowners who never knew the object existed.

So the rule: landowner wins for attached/embedded; finder wins for loose objects unless landowner actively asserts control.

### What the professor will push on

"Shouldn't Peel own everything in his house? It's his property."

Answer: only if he actually exercises control. Ownership of land doesn't automatically extend to all loose personal property on the land. Hannah's actual possession beats Peel's passive ownership.

Or: "What if Peel had lived in the house?"

Answer: stronger case for Peel. If he occupied the house and maintained it, he's more likely to have manifested intent to control objects in it. But even then, a loose object on a window frame might still go to the finder (depends on the circumstances).

### Tiny hypo

Homeowner hires a plumber to fix pipes. Plumber finds cash hidden behind a pipe. Who owns it?

Homeowner argues the cash was embedded (behind the pipe), so landowner has constructive possession of embedded objects.

Plumber argues he's the finder, and Armory applies.

Landowner probably wins here. Cash was hidden/embedded (behind the pipe), not just lying loose. Embedded objects belong to the landowner.

Also, plumber was an employee or contractor, and the employee-finder rule might apply (property found within scope of employment belongs to employer).

## PART 3: Lost vs. Mislaid (5 minutes)

### The categories

Four categories of found property, but three main ones:

**Lost**: owner unintentionally and unknowingly parts with possession. Rule: finder beats landowner.

**Mislaid**: owner intentionally places property somewhere and then forgets. Rule: premises owner (not finder) holds for true owner.

**Abandoned**: owner voluntarily relinquishes all rights. Rule: first finder becomes true owner (not just possessor).

### Why the lost/mislaid distinction?

It's about optimizing return to the true owner.

If property is mislaid, the owner intentionally put it down. They're more likely to remember the place and return there. So the premises owner should hold it (keeps it at the location where the owner left it).

If property is lost, the owner has no idea where it is. They're not coming back to look for it. So giving the finder possession doesn't hurt the true owner's chances of recovery. And it rewards the honest finder.

### The problem: it's arbitrary

Courts have to guess the true owner's mental state based on where the property was found.

Wallet on a shop counter? Probably mislaid (intentionally placed while getting change). Finder: premises owner.

Wallet under a table? Probably lost (accidentally dropped). Finder: finder wins.

But these are just inferences. The true owner's actual intent is unknowable.

Result: the distinction is manipulable. Courts can reach whatever outcome they want by labeling the property lost or mislaid.

### Modern trend

Many states have replaced these categories with statutes: turn property over to police, wait a certain period, if unclaimed the finder gets it (or sometimes the state keeps it).

This avoids the guessing game about mental state.

### What the professor will push on

"How do you know if something's lost or mislaid?"

Answer: you don't. Courts infer from circumstances. Intentional placement (on a counter, in a drawer) suggests mislaid. Unintentional dropping suggests lost. But it's educated guessing.

Or: "Is this distinction worth keeping?"

Answer: arguably no. It's hard to apply and easy to manipulate. Statutory schemes are clearer. But the traditional rule does capture a real intuition: if the owner put it down intentionally, they're more likely to come back.

## PART 4: Water Rights — Two Systems (8 minutes)

### The basic divide

Eastern U.S.: riparian rights. Western U.S.: prior appropriation.

Why the difference? Geography and scarcity.

East: water is abundant. Riparian rights (equal sharing) work fine.

West: water is scarce. Prior appropriation (first in time) incentivizes investment and development.

### Riparian rights

Rule: landowners whose property abuts a watercourse have the right to reasonable use of water.

Old version: natural flow doctrine. Each riparian has the right to water flowing in its natural state. Any diminution is wrongful. Rigid rule.

Modern version: reasonable use doctrine. Each riparian can make reasonable use, even if it reduces flow, as long as it's not unreasonable harm to others. Balancing test.

Reasonableness factors: purpose of use (domestic trumps other uses), extent of harm, practicality of alternatives, prior use.

Key point: no seniority. All riparians have co-equal rights, subject to reasonableness.

### Prior appropriation

Rule: "first in time, first in right."

The first person to divert water and apply it to beneficial use has priority over later appropriators.

Not tied to land ownership. Anyone can appropriate water (not just riparians).

But must put it to beneficial use—irrigation, mining, municipal, industrial. No waste, no speculation.

Also: "use it or lose it." If you don't use your appropriation, you can lose the right (forfeiture/abandonment).

Key point: seniority. Senior appropriators (earlier) have absolute priority over juniors.

### Why prior appropriation in the West?

Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Co. explains.

Arid climate. Water is scarce. Riparian rights would lock water to streamside land, which is inefficient. Best uses (mining, irrigation) are often far from streams.

Prior appropriation allows diversion to wherever the water is most productive.

Also, priority incentivizes investment. If you're the first to divert water, you have secure rights. You can invest in expensive infrastructure—canals, ditches, dams—knowing that later users can't cut you off.

Without priority, no one would invest. Upstream users could always divert and leave you dry.

### The trade-off

Prior appropriation provides certainty and protects investment. But it's inflexible.

Senior appropriators can block higher-value uses by juniors. A 19th-century mining appropriation still has priority over a 21st-century municipal use.

Result: inefficient lock-in. The system doesn't adapt to changing conditions or needs.

Some states allow water markets (buy/sell rights) to mitigate this. But involuntary reallocation is rare because it would undermine the priority system.

### What the professor will push on

"Why not just use reasonable use in the West too?"

Answer: scarcity. Reasonable use works when there's enough water for everyone. In the West, there's not. Rationing is necessary, and priority (first in time) provides a clear rule.

Also, investment. Without priority, no one would build expensive infrastructure.

Or: "Isn't prior appropriation inefficient? What if the junior has a higher-value use?"

Answer: yes, it's inefficient in that sense. But the alternative—uncertainty—would be worse. No one would invest if their rights could be overridden. Water markets can help (juniors buy from seniors), but involuntary reallocation would chill investment.

Or: "What happens during drought?"

Answer: under prior appropriation, seniors get their full amount, juniors get zero. "First in time, first in right." Under riparian rights, all users share the shortfall (reasonable use balancing).

### Tiny hypo

Senior appropriator in Idaho uses water for alfalfa farming. Junior appropriator wants it for semiconductor manufacturing (much higher economic value). Drought: not enough for both.

Under prior appropriation, senior gets everything, junior gets nothing.

Junior argues for reallocation based on higher value. But courts generally won't do it. Priority is the rule.

Junior's option: buy the senior's right (water market). But no forced reallocation.

## PART 5: Broader Themes (1 minute)

### Relativity of title

Armory's principle runs through all of property. Rights are relative, not absolute. Even wrongdoers have enforceable interests against subsequent takers.

### First possession adapted to context

Found property: first possession but with a true owner somewhere, so finder holds for owner.

Water rights: first possession for a fugitive resource. Capture (diversion + beneficial use) creates priority.

### Balancing incentives

All these rules balance competing interests: finders, landowners, true owners, senior users, junior users.

The law picks rules that coordinate behavior and reduce conflict. Sometimes that means sacrificing individual fairness for systemic benefits.

## COLD CALL PREP (2 minutes)

If professor asks, "Why does the finder in Armory win?"

**Answer starter:** "Property rights are relative. As between the finder and the goldsmith, the finder has prior possession, giving him superior title. The true owner could sue both, but as between two wrongdoers, the first possessor wins."

**If pushed:** "This rule prevents endless taking. It protects the finder against third parties and incentivizes honest finding."

---

If professor asks, "When does the landowner beat the finder?"

**Answer starter:** "The landowner wins when the object is attached to or embedded in the land, giving the landowner constructive possession. Also, if the landowner manifests intent to exercise control over all objects on the premises, the landowner can beat the finder even for loose objects."

**If pushed:** "In Hannah, Peel never occupied the house and never manifested control, so Hannah's actual possession beat Peel's non-existent constructive possession."

---

If professor asks, "What's the point of the lost/mislaid distinction?"

**Answer starter:** "It's about optimizing return to the true owner. Mislaid property stays with the premises owner because the true owner is more likely to return there. Lost property goes to the finder because the owner has no idea where it is."

**If pushed:** "But the distinction requires guessing the owner's mental state, which is arbitrary. Modern statutes often replace this with a uniform 'turn it over and wait' rule."

---

If professor asks, "Why did the West adopt prior appropriation?"

**Answer starter:** "Arid climate and scarcity. Riparian rights lock water to streamside land, which is inefficient when the best uses are elsewhere. Prior appropriation allows diversion to wherever water is most productive and incentivizes investment by providing priority."

**If pushed:** "The trade-off is inflexibility—senior appropriators can block higher-value junior uses. But certainty is necessary for investment. Some states allow water markets to improve efficiency."

---

If professor asks, "What happens during a drought under prior appropriation?"

**Answer starter:** "Seniors get their full appropriated amount. Juniors get zero. 'First in time, first in right.' Priority is absolute."

**If pushed:** "Under riparian rights, all users would share the shortfall through reasonable use balancing. Prior appropriation's seniority system is harsher on juniors but provides certainty for seniors."

## WRAP-UP (1 minute)

Three takeaways for class today.

First, finders have strong rights under Armory, but landowners can beat them when objects are attached/embedded or when landowners manifest intent to control.

Second, lost/mislaid distinction tries to optimize return to true owners but is hard to apply. Modern trend is toward statutory solutions.

Third, water rights systems reflect regional scarcity. Riparian rights (equal sharing) for abundant water; prior appropriation (first in time) for scarce water.

Walk in ready to argue both sides of Hannah v. Peel and explain why the West rejected riparian rights.
