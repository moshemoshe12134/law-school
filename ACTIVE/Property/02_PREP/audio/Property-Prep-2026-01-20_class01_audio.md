# Audio Prep — Class #01 — First Possession - Wild Animals and Custom

**Audio length: ~28 minutes | Listen before class on Monday, 2026-01-20**

---

## INTRO (2 minutes)

Welcome to Property. Today we're tackling first possession—specifically, when does chasing a wild animal give you ownership rights? This isn't just about foxes and whales. It's about how property rights start, how the law coordinates behavior when multiple people want the same thing, and when custom can override formal legal rules.

By the end of this prep, you'll understand:
1. The capture rule for wild animals and why courts favor it over pursuit-based rules
2. How custom can create property rights in specific industries
3. The trade-offs between bright-line rules and context-sensitive standards

The central question: what counts as "enough" to create a property right in something that was previously unowned?

---

## PART 1: Pierson v. Post — The Fox Chase (8 minutes)

### The story

Post is hunting a fox with hounds on unoccupied land. Pierson sees this, knows Post is pursuing, kills the fox, and takes it. Post sues.

The issue: does pursuit give you a property right? Or do you need actual capture?

Majority says capture. You need physical control that deprives the animal of its natural liberty. Pursuit isn't enough.

Dissent says pursuit should count, especially when the pursuer is close to capture and the interloper knows what's happening. Seems fairer to the guy who did the work.

### Why the majority picks capture over pursuit

Three reasons.

First, authority. Roman law, continental treatises, English sources all say capture, not pursuit. The majority is following tradition.

Second, certainty. A bright-line rule reduces fights. If pursuit counted, every hunter would argue "I was close enough" and you'd have endless litigation. Capture is clear—either you have it or you don't.

Third, the law won't create liability without a clear property right. Pierson might be a jerk, but if Post doesn't own the fox, Pierson hasn't violated any legal duty.

### The dissent's position

Livingston, dissenting, thinks the majority's rule is too rigid. He emphasizes fairness and social policy. Post put in the labor, chasing a noxious animal. That should count for something. He'd protect pursuit, at least against intentional interference.

He also points to hunter custom—hunters understand pursuit-based rules. Why not follow what the community does?

### What the professor will push on

Expect questions like: "Isn't Pierson's act wrongful? Should he get away with this?"

Answer: morally questionable, legally permissible. The law draws a line at capture. Pierson didn't violate Post's property right because Post didn't have one yet.

Or: "Why not use custom? Hunters all know the rules."

Answer: custom works inside the hunting community, but bright-line rules are legible to everyone—other hunters, landowners, courts. Trade-off between context sensitivity and universality.

Or: "What if Post mortally wounded the fox?"

Answer: majority says mortal wounding plus continued pursuit can count as capture. The animal's no longer at liberty—escape is impossible. That's different from mere pursuit.

### Tiny hypo

Hunter A wounds a deer with a rifle. Deer runs 100 yards and collapses. Hunter B arrives first, tags it, claims it. Who wins?

A argues mortal wounding plus pursuit equals capture. B argues no physical possession yet, so the deer's unowned.

Courts would likely favor A here—mortal wounding removed the animal's liberty. But it's close.

## PART 2: Why "First Possession" Matters (6 minutes)

### Property chains have to start somewhere

Most property rights come from transfers—I buy from you, you bought from someone else, tracing back through history. But at some point, someone had to be first. That's a "root of title."

First possession is one way ownership starts. Others include creation (you make something), discovery (though that's problematic—ask indigenous peoples), and accession (owning the tree means owning the fruit).

### It's about coordination, not just desert

The capture rule isn't primarily about who "deserves" the fox. It's about reducing conflict ex ante.

If everyone knows the rule—capture, not pursuit—they can coordinate. Rival hunters see that someone else has captured the animal and they stand down. No fight, no litigation.

Locke's labor theory says mixing labor with unowned resources creates property. That's a justification for first possession. But the real function is coordination.

### The race-to-capture problem

First-in-time rules can cause wasteful races. Think Oklahoma Land Rush—people race to stake claims, sometimes arriving too early, over-investing in speed rather than productive use.

But pursuit-based rules would cause more uncertainty, not less. Better to have a clear rule that occasionally feels unfair than a vague standard that generates constant disputes.

### Possession as communication

Possession is a signal. The question is: signal to whom?

Rival hunters? Landowners? The general public? Courts?

Bright-line rules (capture) are legible to broad audiences. Custom-based rules (pursuit) work for insiders but break down when outsiders encounter them.

### Tiny hypo

Rancher's cattle graze on open range. Unbranded calf wanders off. Stranger finds it, brands it. Who owns the calf?

Rancher argues accession—calf belongs to owner of the mother cow. Also, open-range custom gives ranchers constructive possession.

Stranger argues unbranded calf on open range is like a wild animal—first to brand wins.

Courts would likely favor the rancher (accession plus custom), but if the calf's been separated/orphaned long enough, it might be treated as abandoned.

## PART 3: Ghen v. Rich — Whaling Custom (6 minutes)

### The story

Fin-back whalers off Cape Cod use bomb-lances. Whale gets hit, sinks, later floats up. Industry custom: killer owns the whale (identifiable by the lance marking). Finders report it, get a small salvage payment.

Here, the plaintiff kills a whale. It washes ashore later. A finder sells it to the defendant, who processes the oil. Plaintiff sues for the value.

Court recognizes the custom. Plaintiff owns the whale.

### Why custom creates property rights here

Three requirements from Ghen:

First, longstanding and universal practice. This isn't one guy's idea—it's the entire industry.

Second, practical necessity. Fin-back whales sink. Immediate physical recovery is impossible. If you required capture, whaling couldn't exist.

Third, industry-sustaining. Without legal protection, killers would have no security against opportunistic finders. The industry would collapse.

### The salvage incentive

Custom includes a payment to finders. This encourages reporting and recovery. Without it, finders might hide or sell the whale. With too much salvage, killers wouldn't hunt (too risky). The custom balances incentives.

### The outsider problem

The finder here probably isn't part of the whaling community. Should he be bound by a custom he doesn't know?

The court says yes, because the custom is necessary and universal. But this raises a fairness issue: binding outsiders to insiders' norms is coercive.

Also, the custom might be efficient for whalers but bad for society—overfishing, conservation concerns. The court doesn't address this.

### What the professor will push on

"Should courts recognize any custom as creating property rights?"

Answer: no. Apply the Ghen framework. Custom must be longstanding, universal, and the only practical means of appropriation. If it meets all three, recognition is justified. If it's just a convenient practice or harms outsiders disproportionately, reject it.

Or: "Is this different from Pierson? Why does custom matter here but not in Pierson?"

Answer: in Pierson, there's an alternative rule that works fine—capture. Custom isn't necessary. In Ghen, there's no alternative. You can't require immediate physical possession of a whale that sinks. Custom is the only solution.

### Tiny hypo

Commercial fishermen have a custom: if one boat's net breaks and fish escape, other boats wait 24 hours before catching those fish. Outsider boat catches immediately.

Should courts recognize the custom?

Fishermen argue it's longstanding and necessary to sustain cooperation.

Outsider argues it's parochial, he didn't know about it, and fish are fugitive resources—capture is the only rule.

Courts would likely reject this custom. It's about cooperation, not necessity. Ordinary capture rules work fine. Also, the outsider lacks notice.

## PART 4: Broader Themes (4 minutes)

### Bright-line rules vs. standards

Capture is a bright-line rule. Pursuit would be a standard (how close is close enough?).

Bright-line rules reduce information costs and litigation. Everyone knows the rule, everyone can comply.

Standards are context-sensitive and fair. But they're harder to apply and generate more disputes.

Property law tends to favor bright-line rules for exactly this reason.

### Custom as efficient private ordering

Close-knit communities generate norms that work for them. Whaling custom in Ghen is an example.

But custom can be oppressive, exclusionary, or inefficient from a social perspective. Courts should be skeptical, not automatic.

The test: is it truly necessary? Is it universal within the industry? Does it harm outsiders?

### First possession beyond animals

We'll see first possession again: found property, water rights, oil and gas, spectrum, land itself (adverse possession).

The core question is always the same: what act counts as "enough" to create a property right? And how do we balance certainty, fairness, and efficiency?

## COLD CALL PREP (2 minutes)

If professor asks, "Who should win in Pierson?"

**Answer starter:** "The majority holds that Pierson wins because Post lacked a property right. Property requires capture, not mere pursuit. The rule prioritizes certainty over individual fairness."

**If pushed:** "The dissent would hold for Post based on fairness and custom, but the majority values a clear rule that reduces disputes ex ante."

---

If professor asks, "What's the point of the Ghen custom?"

**Answer starter:** "The custom solves a practical problem—fin-back whales sink, so immediate physical possession is impossible. Without recognizing the custom, whaling couldn't exist. The custom also includes salvage to incentivize reporting."

**If pushed:** "But the custom binds outsiders who may not know about it. That's a fairness problem. The court justifies it by saying the custom is necessary and universal."

---

If professor asks, "Does landowner have a claim in Pierson?"

**Answer starter:** "Potentially, under the doctrine of ratione soli—ownership by reason of the soil. English law gave landowners constructive possession of animals on unenclosed land. But American courts generally reject this for waste land."

**If pushed:** "If the land is enclosed or the landowner actively excludes hunters, the landowner might have a stronger claim. But on open, unoccupied land, probably not."

---

If professor asks, "Is Locke's labor theory relevant here?"

**Answer starter:** "Yes. Locke says mixing labor with unowned resources creates property. Post's pursuit is labor. But the majority doesn't follow labor theory—it follows a bright-line rule. The dissent is closer to Locke."

**If pushed:** "The problem with labor theory is it's indeterminate. Whose labor counts—Post's pursuit or Pierson's killing? Courts prefer administrable rules."

---

If professor asks, "What about a mortal wounding scenario?"

**Answer starter:** "The majority says mortal wounding plus continued pursuit can constitute capture because the animal's no longer at liberty. Escape is impossible, so it's functionally equivalent to physical possession."

**If pushed:** "That's still a control-based rule, just with a lower threshold. It's not rewarding mere pursuit—it's recognizing that the animal's fate is sealed."

---

## WRAP-UP (1 minute)

Three takeaways for class today.

First, first possession creates property rights, but the law requires clear signals—usually capture, not mere pursuit.

Second, custom can create property rights when it's necessary, universal, and the only practical solution. But courts should be cautious about binding outsiders.

Third, the trade-off between bright-line rules and standards runs through all of property law. Certainty reduces conflict but sometimes sacrifices fairness.

Walk in ready to defend either side in Pierson. That's the move the professor's likely to make.
