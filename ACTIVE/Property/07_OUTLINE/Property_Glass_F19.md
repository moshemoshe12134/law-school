This is my conclusion.

The rule that is applicable here is X.

Plaintiffs will argue that X means that ABC; this is how it applies, similar to JKL case.

In contrast, defendants will argue that X should mean XYZ.

Because of policy justifications like 1, 2, 3, the court will likely [CONCLUSION].

**What is property?**

* Answers the question: who gets what?
* Governs **relations** between people
* Characteristics of property:
  1. **Pre-packaged bundles** – different rights can be packaged into different forms of bundles
  2. **Entitlements** – e.g. right to use, right to exclude, right to transfer, immunity from loss
  3. **Enforceable against the world**
     + Unlike contracts, don’t need the individualized offer/acceptance to be binding
     + Courts/the state will enforce these rights - HOWEVER, these rights are not absolute

**Important Policy Considerations:**

* Distribute justice/fairness
* Efficiency
* Administrability
* Protecting individualized expectations / certainty – should the law be static or dynamic?
* Protecting personhood

**UNIT 1: JUSTIFYING PROPERTY RIGHTS**

**A Starting Point: A Fox on a Beach**

***State v. Shack* (NJ 1971)*–* p.4 –** this case illustrates what the defining characteristics of property law are. “Property rights serve human values. They are recognized to that end, and are limited by it.”

* **Facts:** Defendants entered private property to talk to farm workers about their rights.
* **Holding:** Court declined to charge for trespassing. Balance of rights of owner and rights of individual. Some rights are too fundamental to be denied on the basis of an interest in real property and too fragile to be left to the unequal bargaining strength of the parties.
* **Reasoning**: Not going to reach constitutional arguments (1st Amendment, Preemption). Property must serve human values. Migrant workers are rootless and isolated and don’t know their own rights. Government set out to provide them assistance. Communication is key to that assistance. Property rights are limited. Over time, we recognize a shift from pure individualism to increasing public needs (industrialization, complex societies) Not about Tenants rights. Property rights cannot allow a landowner to deny the migrant worker practical access to those things he needs or that are fundamental to being a citizen.
* **Takeaways:**
  + “Property rights serve human values. They are recognized to that end, and are limited by it.”
  + Right to exclude is not absolute.

***Pierson v. Post* (NY 1805) – p.136 –** rule of first possession

* **Facts:** Post, the plaintiff in this case, was hunting a fox using hounds on public property, jointly owned by the members of the town. Pierson, knowing that the fox was being chased by Post, killed it first, and took the fox home
  + The trial court found for Post; Pierson appealed.
* **Issue:** Whether Post’s pursuit entitled him to the right to kill the fox?
  + Better stated: what acts amount to possession?
* **Holding:** Because ancient legal texts entitle the killer to the spoils of the hunt, and because no contrary principles are at play, Pierson is entitled to the animal.
  + Mere pursuit is not enough.
  + **Rule of first possession**
* **Reasoning:**
  + Historical legal texts say that only physical possession of a wild animal constitutes possession.
    - Because Post did not possess the animal, he is not entitled to its ownership.
  + Other principles may entitle him to ownership: (if he wounded the animal, then continued his pursuit OR if the fox were on his land), but this isn’t the case here.
  + Certainty/administrability
  + **Counterarguments:**
    - **Locke** – If you invest labor into acquiring something, it should be yours. Because you own your own body and your own labor – so you should own the fruits of your labor.
* **Dissent:**
  + This should never have been decided by a court – rather it should have been adjudicated by arbitration.
  + **Efficiency:** The decision discourages people from investing in the pursuit if anyone could pick off the spoils: if the hunter expended resources, they should be entitled to spoils.
  + **Hot** pursuit should establish property rights over the animal.
* **Notes:**
  + Given the common law requirement to have control over one's possessions, merely giving chase was not sufficient. Something more was needed, otherwise law would create a slippery slope. Among the authorities cited by the court in its opinion were the works of William Blackstone, Fleta, Jean Barbeyrac, Samuel von Pufendorf, Hugo Grotius, and Justinian I.

***Popov v. Hayashi* (CA 2002) –** p.142 – personhood, illustration of what property can mean to individuals, establishing a pre-possessory interest

* **Facts**: Barry Bonds hit his 73rd home-run of the season on October 7, 2001. The ball was the property of MLB, then became abandoned property. The Ball landed in Popov’s mitt. Popov was tackled by a mob, assaulted by them. Hayashi was also pushed down by the mob, found the ball and picked it up.
* **Legal question**: Who has ownership of an item when one acquired it legally, but lost it due to the criminal act of another third party, allowing the other person to acquire the item legally?
* **Holding**: “Both men have a superior claim to the ball as against all the world. Each man has a claim of equal dignity as to the other.”
* **Reasoning**: **Fundamental fairness** to both men. Baseball fans are accustomed to dominion and control establishing possession. Popov. established a pre-possessory interest that was impinged by the illegal actions of the mob. But Hayashi did nothing wrong, was also a victim of the mob. He just happened to find the ball and take possession of it.
  + **Personhood** as another factor when thinking about property - **Radin**

**\*\*Takeaways from *Pierson* and *Popov:***

1. Identify and apply possible rules of original acquisition. *Why would you apply one rule over another?*
   1. Labor & investment (**Locke)**
   2. Rule of first physical capture (Roman law)
   3. Rule of first possession (Judge Tompkins – *Pierson)*
   4. Rule of “Hot Pursuit” (Judge Livingston – *Pierson* dissent)
2. Evaluate rules of original acquisition with reference to different goals:
   1. Ensuring **fairness and justice**
   2. Promoting **efficiency and social utility**
   3. Protecting **individual expectations**
   4. Protecting **personhood (Radin)**

**Theories of Property**

Locke (Labor Theory of Property)

* Two key premises
  + Self-ownership (you own yourself and your labor)
  + Original common endowment of resources (everything in the world belongs to everyone)
* In order to own something, you need to mix your labor with it.
* Note: the theory is derived from the larger idea of natural rights

Bentham & Marshall (Positivist Theory of Property)

* Bentham
  + “Property and law are born together, and die together. Before laws were made there was no property; take away laws, and property ceases.”
  + Property rights are what the law says are property rights
* Marshall
  + The Antelope: according to natural rights, slavery is wrong, but we see all these laws saying that slavery is okay 🡪 positive law supersedes natural law

Harris: *Whiteness as Property*

* “Not all first possession or labor gave rise to property rights; rather the rules of first possession and labor as a basis for **property rights were qualified by race**. This fact infused whiteness with significance and value because it was solely through being white that property could be acquired and secured under law.”
* American system of slavery
  + All African people are slaves = being black makes you a slave
  + No white people are slaves = being white makes you free
    - Whiteness functions as a form of property that protects you yourself from the worst form of dehumanization, that is, being “properitized”
* Taking of Native American land
  + Whiteness is a form of property because the only kind of first possession that matters for staking claim to the land is the kind of possession that is culturally white—that is, modifying the land rather than leaving it in its natural state

Demsetz, Ostrom, Rose (Utilitarian Theory of Property)

* Social Utility: we should value the property rights that do the most good for the most people
* Forward looking; based on incentives
* Demsetz (Tragedy of the Commons)
  + The primary function of property rights is to internalize externalities
    - Why? Tragedy of the Free Rider: but for property protections there won’t be incentives for people to engage in work
  + Solution: either give everyone a private property right, or make the public good subject to government regulation
* Ostrom (Myth of the Tragedy of the Commons)
  + You don’t always have a free rider
  + You don’t always need a robust private property right
    - Private actors faced with the challenges of under-consumption or over-production will come together to find a co-operative solution
* Rose (Comedy of the Commons)
  + “Used in commerce, some property had qualities akin to infinite “returns to scale.” Thus here, the commons was not tragic, but comedic, in the classical sense of a story with a happy outcome. And customary doctrines suggest that commerce might be thought a “comedy of the commons” not only because it may infinitely expand our wealth, but also, at least in part, because it has been thought to enhance the sociability of the members of an otherwise atomized society.”

Radin (Personhood Theory of Property)

* There is intrinsic value in certain objects; these objects cannot be commodified
* **Radin**
  + Types of goods: fungible v. personal
    - Fungible: “Property that is held instrumentally”; replaceable, not unique, indifference to existence if net worth unchanged; *alienable*
    - Personal: “Property that is bound up with a person”; unique, irreplaceable, not held for exchange, *inalienable*
  + Three key questions:
    - Why are you holding on to a good? (for exchange or for sentimental value)
    - Can the good be replaced? What would happen if you couldn’t replace it?
    - Is the good an external or internal good?

**Acquisition by First Possession**

First Possession: Justification

* Clear and administrable: prevents the court from scrutinizing each factual scenario and making a subjective judgement.
* Counter-argument: fairness.
  + If you have worked to bring something into your possession, you should be able to enjoy the fruits of your labor.

Harris: Rules of first possession and labor were qualified by race.

**Claiming Land**

***Johnson v. M’Intosh* (1823)** – p.88 – acquiring property rights in land, doctrine of discovery

* **Facts**: Johnson claimed the land by purchase from the Piankeshaw Indians. M’Intosh claimed the land because he had been granted a title to it by the U.S. government, tracing chain of title back to the King of England deeding the land to Virginia.
* **Issue:** Whether plaintiffs' title to land, conveyed by a Native American tribe, was superior to defendants' title, conveyed by the United States government.
* **Holding**: Johnson does not have title to the land that can be sustained by the court of the U.S.
* **Reasoning**: Under the **doctrine of discovery**, the first European to see the land possesses the exclusive right of acquiring title to it vis-a-vis any other European, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy.
  + *Positivism*: property rights are what the law says are property rights: “Conquest gives a title which the courts of conqueror cannot deny…not for the Courts of this county to question the validity of this title" – Marshall.
  + *Sovereignty:* Property is the protection of expectations recognized by the sovereign government (**Bentham**: you have to look to what the law says)

**Claiming People**

***Dred Scott v. Sanford (U.S. 1857)* – p.248**

* **Facts:** Dred Scott was an enslaved person in Missouri. From 1833 to 1843, he resided in Illinois (a free state) and in the Louisiana Territory, where slavery was forbidden by the Missouri Compromise of 1820. After returning to Missouri, Scott filed suit in Missouri court for his freedom, claiming that his residence in free territory made him a free man. After losing, Scott brought a new suit in federal court.
* **Issues:** What is the status of Scott? Is he a “citizen” and therefore entitled to sue in a U.S. court?
* **Holding**: No. African-Americans “whose ancestors were imported into [the U.S.], and sold as slaves,” whether enslaved or free could not be an American citizen and therefore did not have standing to sue in federal court. The Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional. Congress cannot free enslaved people who flee into the territories. Enslaved people are property under the 5th Amendment, so a law depriving slave owners of their “property” is unconstitutional.
* **Reasoning:** Justice Taney uses history and the textual provisions of key documents to argue that Scott should not be recognized as a citizen. Concept of whiteness=property rights and blackness=status as property was so deeply entrenched in society at the time (Harris). Positive law in place that reinforces system of slavery. Sovereignty (Bentham) – the law is what the government who is in charge says it is.
  + **Counterarguments**: Locke – you own your body and you own the fruits of your labor.

**Claiming Found Objects**

**LAW OF FINDERS**

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Finder is…?** | **Property Is…?** | | | | |
| *Abandoned* (Intentionally relinquished) | *Mislaid*  (Intentionally left but forgotten) | *Lost*  (Accidentally misplaced) | *Embedded*  (Buried) | *Treasure* |
| *Invitee/Licensee*  (Person on the land with Landowner’s permission) | Finder wins. | Landowner wins unless True Owner arrives. | Finder wins unless/until True Owner arrives. | Landowner wins. | Finders win, assuming Treasure Trove Statute |
| If in private home, True Owner wins, then Homeowner | |
| *Trespasser*  (Person on land without Landowner’s permission) | Landowner wins. | | | | |
| *\*Finders Statutes* | Finders must report whatever they find to police. Property awarded to finder if it is not claimed within a reasonable period. True owner must pay some percentage of value to finder. Not followed except in Japan, which criminalizes non-reporting and guarantees a % of value of found object to finder, and which has effective institutions for implementation. | | | | |

**Rule of Finders:**

* Administrability: the rule is clear and easy for courts to apply.
  + Prevents extra-judicial self-help remedies.
* Efficiency: incentivizes finders to actually find things, and put them to use, rather than hiding them for fear of adverse title action from a third party.
* **Exception to the Rule of Finders**: if the finder was trespassing on the rightful owner’s property when he found the item.

How do courts decide between two competing parties re: a found object?

***Wilcox v. Stroup (4th Cir. 2006)* – p.151, finder v. claimed true owner**

* **Facts:** W (finder) tries to sell the papers; S attains a temporary restraining order from the state
* **Issue:** In the absence of clear chain of title, does W have title to the papers?
* **Holding:** The court determined that without the benefit of clear chain of title, evidence of original ownership, eyewitness testimony, or other useful aids in determining ownership, the court presumes ownership in favor of possession (e.g. Wilcox family).
* **Rule:** Presumption of title – presumption of title establishes the burden of proof where another party has to prove superior title
  + **Reasoning:**
    - Presumption of title promotes stability – expectations remain undisturbed
    - Efficiency – people are incentivized to use their possessions in a way that increases social wealth
    - Administrability of the rule – this is a great way to resolve the question

How do you prove abandonment?

***Charrier v. Bell (La. 1986)* – p.158, finder v. landowner [Charrier v. Tunica-Biloxi, finder v. claimed true owner]**

* **Facts:** amateur archeologist (Charrier) uncovered tribal burial ground on private land and removed 2.5 tons of artifacts from it without permission of the landowner. He attempted to sell artifacts, but buyers were concerned that it he wasn’t the actual owner. He filed a suit against the Trudeau Plantation to get a declaratory judgment that he was the owner of the artifacts so he could proceed with sales.
* **Issue:** Does the burial of artifacts or other objects with the deceased result in abandonment of those artifacts?
* **Holding:** The finder (archaeologist) does not have a property interest in the artifacts. Burying objects with deceased is not equivalent to abandonment or relinquishment of ownership because they were placed there for customary, religious or spiritual belief. (In the circumstances and context → not abandonment)
  + Rejected his claim of unjust enrichment (could not show a resulting impoverishment because the majority of the excavation occurred while he had knowledge that he did not have consent to be on the land.)
* **Reasoning:** The fact that items were buried with the deceased due to some customary, religious, or spiritual belief does not result in a conclusion that the goods were abandoned because it is not intended as a means of relinquishing ownership to a stranger. Unjust enrichment does not apply.
* **Rule:** In the absence of a perfect chain of title, a federally recognized tribe can establish ownership over excavated burial goods when, as here,
  + the tribe claiming ownership is an accumulation of the descendants of the original owners (p.160); and
  + the original owners’ intention in interring the objects was not to abandon the good, but rather, for the burial goods to remain there perpetually (p.161)

***Armory v. Delamirie (K.B, 1722)* – p.156** – **finder v. subsequent possessor**

* **Facts:** Chimney sweeper’s boy found a jewel and carried it to defendant’s shop, who was goldsmith. Gave it to goldsmith, master offered boy money, who asked for jewel back instead. Apprentice gave him back socket without stones. Boy files suit in **trover** (damages for wrongful interference with personal property)
* **Issue:** Who owned the jewel or had a right to it?
* **Holding:** Boy, though he does not have absolute property or ownership, has superior claim against all but the rightful owner.
  + Relativity of title = finder can have title that is good against everyone except the true owner
* **Justifications:**
  + ***Administrability:***Easy to determine who found property.
  + ***Efficient:***Holding that jeweler could obtain property would create incentive to steal. Holding that finder may own incentivizes people to look for lost items and to take greater care of these items.
* Note: Rule would not hold if chimney sweeper’s boy was a trespasser.

**Claiming Information: Common Property**

How do we deal with property that is intangible? How do we motivate creators to do their work – in ways that don’t compromise public access to their work? What is the role of the courts v. the legislature in defining property rights?

***INS v. AP (U.S. 1918)* – p.112 –** creating property rights in information

* **Facts:** AP is upset about the news—the historical fact—that they’re claiming INS is taking from them. Harvesting this news requires significant effort & expense (analogy to Livingston dissent in *Pierson*).
  + World of tangible property rules doesn’t fit as neatly here.
  + Analogy to *Johnson v. M’Intosh*? Doctrine of discovery – designed to resolve competition between parties for some kind of resource.
    - BUT incentives are tricky and different here: we don’t want to build a monopoly in the area of information. Also, you can have many “discoverers” of news—makes it hard to administer this rule.
  + News cannot be copyrighted! Common law copyright doesn’t help us either, because the news has already been published.
* **Arguments**:
  + AP relies on Demsetz theory of “the tragedy of the commons” – creating individual property rights will promote more efficient use of that property. You need property rights to incentivize journalists
    - Counteragument: Ostrom: Collaboration/collective action is good; you don’t need an individual property right, just a kind of quasi-property right. Let people create their own self-governing principles
      * Clearly defined boundaries should be in place.
      * Rules in use are well matched to local needs and conditions.
      * Individuals affected by these rules can usually participate in modifying the rules.
      * The right of community members to devise their own rules is respected by external authorities.
      * A system for self-monitoring members' behavior has been established.
      * A graduated system of sanctions is available.
      * Community members have access to low-cost conflict-resolution mechanisms.
      * Nested enterprises-that is, appropriation, provision, monitoring and sanctioning, conflict resolution, and other governance activities-are organized in a nested structure with multiple layers of activities.
  + INS arguments: AP has published the news—no common-law copyright
  + AP is only seeking a right to exclude their competitors – a type of quasi-property
* **Holding:** No property right in the news, but AP has a quasi-property right.
  + Doctrine of misappropriation: There has to be some level of **labor and investment**. The property needs to have some **value** – someone wants to buy it.
  + This quasi-property right disappears as soon as the information ceases to be valuable.
* **Holmes dissent**: This is more a question about fraud – potential solution is for INS to attribute AP as source of news. Also, property does not arise from value 🡪 it arises from the law (Bentham). Labor is also not enough to get you a property right.
* **Brandeis dissent:** The general rule of law is that once something is published, it’s free for common use. The courts shouldn’t just invent a new property right – there should be a separation of powers between judiciary and legislature. It’s not the court’s role to do this.

**Claiming Original Works: Copyright**

**STATUTORY FRAMEWORK: COPYRIGHT ACT** (p.187)

* Section 102:
  1. Is there copyright protection?

Original (See *Feist*)

Work of authorship

Tangible form of expression

* 1. Distinction between idea/facts and the expression of the idea
     + Only the expression can be copyrighted
* Section 106: Is there copyright infringement?
  1. Reproduction (*Suntrust*)
  2. Derivative works
  3. Rental, lease, lending, or sale of reproductions
  4. Performing audiovisual works publicly
  5. Displaying audiovisual works publicly
  6. Performing copyrighted sound recordings publicly through digital audio transmission
* Section 107: Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair Use
  + Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

* + The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.

**JUSTIFICATIONS FOR COPYRIGHT PROTECTIONS**

* US Constitution: to promote the progress of science and arts
* Utilitarian/economic theories – without protection, people would not have the incentive to create and innovate.
  + Public goods – there are some goods where it’s impossible to exclude others from using it, and one’s consumption of it does not deplete the resources for other people
* Locke – people should enjoy the fruits of their own labor – “sweat of the brow”
* Hegel/Radin – personhood – the creator’s identity is wrapped up with their creation, and we should protect these creators and their investments. These are non-fungible goods, highly creative/original works, and are more about the creative energy of the artist.

**SUMMARY: REQUIREMENTS FOR COPYRIGHT PROTECTIONS**

* **Originality (*Feist):*** the work must be an independent creation of the author and must demonstrate at least some minimal degree of creativity; cannot copyright facts—consumers need facts and can produce them without copyright; proxy for added value for Congress—not always line up, such as shitty art v. phonebook; has *fair use exception*. – originality, not labor is the basis of copyright.
* **Work of authorship:** Federal statute identifies eight of such works: literary works (including computer programs); musical works; dramatic works; pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; motion pictures and other audiovisual works; sound recordings; and architectural works.
  + Not included: any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery.
  + Law protects expressions, not ideas.
* **Fixation:** the work must be fixed in some kind of tangible medium.

***Feist v. Rural Telephone Services (U.S. 1991)* – p.189 –** Copyright Act Section 102(a) and relationship to (b); originality requirement

* **Facts:** Rural Telephone is seeking copyright protection for its telephone book
* **Issue:** What constitutes an original work of authorship?
* **Holding:** Rural Telephone’s telephone book is not copyrighted because there was nothing original or creative about placing its subscribers’ basic information in alphabetical order in the white pages.
* **Reasoning:**
  + Facts cannot be protected (see: *INS v. AP*); work of authorship is compilation of facts
  + There are 2 potential theories re: whether the compilation is original:
    - Sweat of the brow (Locke)
      * Good proxy for level of investment/time – we should create the right incentives and protect endeavors where the upfront costs would be very high (utilitarian)
    - Creative selection – there needs to be an arrangement, selection
      * There needs to be some modicum of creativity in the arrangement and selection of the compilation. Originality is the essential factor here.
* **Rule:** Originality Requirement: there are two requirements for something to be original to the owner
  + It must be independently created
  + It must possess some minimal degree of creativity

***Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin –* p.195 –** question of who gets to be an author? Fair use doctrine

* **Facts:** Suntrust has copyright in the classic *Gone with the Wind* (GWTW). Alice Randall writes a book titled T*he Wind Done Gone* (TWDG), which uses several characters, plots and scenes from GWTW. Randall claims that her book is a critique of GWTW’s depiction of slavery and the Civil-War era American South. Suntrust brings suit to enjoin Randall’s publisher from publishing her work.
* **Issue:** Whether a book that is intended to parody a copyrighted work by admittedly appropriating aspects (like characters, plot and scenes) can be enjoined from publication based on copyright violations.
* **Holding:** No, the book is entitled to a fair-use defense under the copyright statute.
* **Reasoning:**
  + **Threshold question:** Is this a work of parodic character?
    - **Rule:** a work will be treated as a parody if its aim is to comment upon or criticize a prior work by appropriating elements of the original in creating a new artistic, as opposed to scholarly or journalistic, work.
  + **Next question:** is the use a fair use of the copyright in light of the four factors listed in the statute?
    - Whether the purpose and character of the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
      * Randall’s work is of commercial nature, but this prong weighs in favor of her because her work is “transformative” (creating a new work told from a different perspective)
    - the nature of the copyrighted work;
      * Copyright protection affords greater protection to original works; but this prong is irrelevant here because Randall’s work is a parody, which invariably draws on publicly known work
    - the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole;
    - the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
      * Randall’s work will not act as a market substitute for GWTW → this prong is in favor of her

**Claiming Inventions: Patents and Biotechnology**

**PATENT LAW: IP STATUTES**

There are two forms of IP protected by law:

1. Copyright: “original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression”. Exclusive right to use or authorize the use of work for a limited time – dates back to Statute of Anne. U.S. time period is author’s life plus 70 years, or 95 years after publication or 120 years after creation of works made for hire.
2. Patent: Issued to anyone who “invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter or any new and useful improvement thereof.” Generally last 20 years. Must be registered. US PTO adjudicates whether new and non-obvious.
   * Note that power to create and provide patents is provided to Congress by Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution.

***A.M.P. v. Myriad Genetics* – p.209** – patenting human genetic material, interpreting & debating sec. 101

* **Facts**: Myriad discovered the breast cancer gene and got a patent giving them the exclusive right to isolate it (thereby giving them the exclusive right to test women for it and to conduct research on it) as well as a patent protecting cDNA made based off the DNA strand.
* **Rule:** Naturally occurring phenomenon are not patentable.
* **Holding**: BRCA1 and BRCA2 are naturally occurring molecules and are not patentable. cDNA is patentable because it is not naturally occurring but instead is produced by the lab technician based on the DNA.
* **Reasoning:**
  + **BRCA1 and BRCA2:** Naturally occurring, not created by Myriad – it’s common property; Groundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the §101 inquiry; extensive effort alone is insufficient to satisfy the demands of §101. There’s a difference between man-made DNA and naturally-occurring matter
  + **cDNA**: a lab technician creates something when cDNA is made
  + **Counterarguments:**
    - Demsetz – tragedy of the commons: people will stop inventing; without clear property rights, it would be hugely complicated to get permission to use those ideas to continue inventing
    - “Sweat of the brow”

***Moore v. Regents –* p.268** – what are the rights of the donor to their body parts?

* **Facts:** Moore undergoes treatment for hairy-cell leukemia at UCLA Medical Center. Has spleen removed, blood drawn. Doctors manufacture cell line based on blood cells (lymphokines) for profitable research, without obtaining Moore’s consent.
  + Moore files two claims against doctors, UCLA Regents, Researchers, Genetis Institute, Pharma company Sandoz for: 1) Property Conversion, and 2) lack of informed consent/breach of fiduciary duty. Defendants file motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.
  + Moore claims his cell line is his property. Cell lines are unique, like a human likeness, which is protected under privacy rights – celebrities have proprietary interest in own likeness, and unauthorized business use of likeness is redressable as a tort.
  + Regents claim cell line not unique, value created through their labor (**Locke**), labor also created an expectation to gain advantage from ownership (**Bentham**). Cell lines being marketedare new creations in which they can have a patent right.
* **Rule**: There is no property interest/ownership in these discarded cells. He neither possesses them nor has title to them.
* **Holding (Panelli):** Moore’s complaint states a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty and lack of informed consent, but not for conversion
* **Reasoning:**
  + ***Fairness:*** Lymphokines, unlike name or face, have same molecular structure in every human being. **Not unique**.
  + ***Consistency with Existing Law:*** Statues already regulate tissue disposal limit control over excised cells for reasons of public health and safety. Such statutes already eliminate rights ordinarily attached to property.
  + ***Fairness/Labor:*** Patented cell line is factually and legally distinct from cells in Moore’s body. Federal law permits patenting organisms that are products of “human ingenuity,” not discovery of naturally occurring organisms (the original cells in Moore’s body)
  + ***Social Utility*:** Risk of disincentivizing research by exposing researchers engaged in socially useful activity to liability – thousands of lines already exist in tissue repositories; routinely copied and distributed.
  + ***Role of Courts/Institutional Competence:*** “If scientific uses of human cells are to be held liable for failing to investigate the consensual pedigree of their raw materials, we believe the legislature should make that decision.”
* **Dissent (Mosk):**
  + ***bundle of rights:*** Property, a creation of law, is a ***bundle of rights*** that may be exercised with respect to an object – **1) right to possess, 2) right to use, 3) right to exclude, 4) right to transfer.** Majority says because discarded tissue is regulated, there is no property interest. But it is possible to recognize some property interests and not others in a given object (contracts can limit transfer of real property, etc.). It is possible for Moore to still have a property interest of some sort in the cells.
  + ***Fairness:***  Cell line is primarily the work product of Regents, but Moore’s contribution is critical. Without his cell, the product wouldn’t exist. Regents were unjustly enriched, and equity demands compensation to Moore.

**UNIT 2: THE RIGHT TO EXCLUDE**

**Does the owner of the property have the right to exclude non-owners in the particular context of the case at hand?**

Consider: Social setting, reasons access is demanded (e.g. necessity, investigative journalism), reasons access is restricted, weighing the relative importance of competing interests

Reoccurring theme: Property rights can be exercised in a way that inflicts illegitimate harm on others.

**COMMON LAW LIMITS ON THE RIGHT TO EXCLUDE**

**Trespass and Defenses**

**Trespass Definition**

* An (**1) unprivileged, (2) intentional (3) intrusion on property** possessed by another.
  + *Intent*: doesn’t mean that you have to intend to trespass, just that you intended to be somewhere.
    - You are not trespassing if you are kidnapped; it is trespass if you unknowingly enter.
  + *Intrusion*: occurs the moment the non-owner enters the property
* Trespass is *Privileged* (not wrongful) if
  + (1) entry is done with the owner’s consent,
  + (2) entry is justified by necessity, or
  + (3) entry is encouraged by public policy.
    - The court defines public policy privilege on a case-by-case basis.
* NOTE: Right to exclude is among the core rights in the “bundle of sticks.” Protecting expectations with respect to this right is an essential function of property law – *Jacque v. Steenberg Homes*
* Trespass and government searches – fourth amendment of Constitution- does the government search constitute an unreasonable search of an enumerated category of the fourth amendment? – *Katz v. US, US v. Jones* (p.22)

***State v. Shack* (NJ 1971)*–* p.4** – state law limits on the right to exclude

* **Holding:** Employer does not have possessory right to deprive employee of privacy or opportunity to live with dignity. The farmer still has the right to exclude, generally.
  + Court sidesteps constitutional question, looks to rights enumerated by state law.
* **Notes:** Property law is fundamentally about the allocation of power between people.
  + Also suggests potential framing in terms of licensee-license-holder relationship: migrant workers should be allowed to receive visitors, so long as that right doesn’t interfere with others’ rights

### ***Commonwealth v. Magadini* (Mass. 2016) – p.9** – necessity defense, exception to trespass

* **Facts:** Defendant has been homeless for over a decade. He was charged with trespassing on three properties in Great Barrington, where he was sleeping at night near a heater to avoid the winter’s cold.
  + The defendant did not contest that he had violated the no-trespass order; rather he claimed the necessity defense. Because he had been kicked out of a nearby shelter, and had no home, he claimed that there was no other alternative to escape from the cold.
* **Question:** Whether Magadini could claim the necessity defense to defeat his trespass charge.
* **Rule of Law:** A trial court committed error in refusing the defendant’s request for a jury instruction on the necessity defense when, as here.
  + The defendant satisfied the foundational elements entitling him to the defense by showing that there was “reasonable doubt” about the availability of legal alternatives to abate a clear and imminent danger, and there was “little question” that the weather conditions presented a “clear and imminent danger” for a homeless person.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + Elements to the necessity defense: (1) clear and imminent danger; (2) reasonable expectation that actions will be effective as the cause of abating the danger; (3) there is no legal alternative; (4) the legislature has not precluded the defense by clear and deliberate choice.
    - There was a **clear and imminent danger**: the February/March weather conditions in Massachusetts
    - **Availability of legal alternatives**: there is evidence that the defendant lacked legal alternatives to trespass during the cold days.
      * Could show that some of his options were foreclosed: no home, no shelter in town
      * He doesn’t have to show that there he conceptualized all possible alternatives, just that there is reasonable doubt about the availability of legal alternatives.
* **Notes:** Court potentially leveraging criminal procedure to indirectly influence policy re: homelessness
  + *Ploof v. Putnam*: the court held that necessity justifies a trespass when needed to save lives or property and the defendant committed a tort against the plaintiffs by unmooring the boat
  + *Vincent v. Lake Erie Transportation*: a steamship moored to a private wharf was required to pay damages when the wind thrust the ship onto the wharf

***Desnick v. American Broadcasting Co*. (7th Cir. 1995) – p.19** – consent as limitation on right to exclude

* **Facts:** Seven employees of ABC posed as potential patients for Desnick in order to report an undercover story about the eye doctor’s practice. Separately, ABC requested to film inside the practice with a promise to provide “fair and balanced” reporting.
  + When ABC released a report critical of Desnick, he sued for trespass.
* **Rule of Law:** The entry was not invasive in the sense of infringing the kind of interest of the plaintiffs that the law of trespass protects; it was not an interreference with the ownership or possession of the land.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + This isn’t unprivileged fraud because there was no interference with the types of interests that trespass generally tries to protect.
    - No doctor-patient privilege was violated, no trade secrets were stolen, and nothing within the practice was disrupted.
* **Notes:** Consent obtained through fraud can be legitimate in some instances – especially where no harm resulted. This was also in a place of business open to the public

***Food Lion v. ABC* – p.20**– where activities exceeded scope of consent given

* **Facts:** ABC videotaping supermarket’s activities. Supermarket initially consented to entry of individual posing as employee
* But videotaping constituted trespass, because this action exceeded scope of the consent initially given
  + However, videotaping/broadcast was protected by the First Amendment

***Jacque v. Steenberg Homes, Inc.* (Wis. 1997) – p.38** – right without a remedy is not a right

* **Facts:** Steenberg Homes transported a mobile home across the Jacques property, despite repeated pleas from the Jacques not to do so. The Jacques repeatedly refused Steenberg the right to pass, and pointed on a map to their property line
  + The trial court found for the Jacques, and awarded $1 in nominal damages, and $100,000 in putative damages. The appeals court set the putative damages aside.
* **Question:** Whether punitive damages to the tune of $100,000 can be used to punish trespass
* **Rule of Law:** Punitive damages are appropriate in a private trespass action.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + The right of exclusion from property is fundamental to any real property rights regime.
    - Courts recognize a harm, even if it isn’t reflected in terms of nominal damages.
    - The right loses its meaning if there is no punishment for its infringement.
      * Society writ large has an interest in deterring trespass.
  + Punitive damages were sufficient in this case to ensure that Steenberg does not find it more profitable to trammel on rights than to respect them.
* **Takeaway:** Right to exclude is among the core rights in the “bundle of sticks.” Protecting expectations with respect to this right is an essential function of property law.
  + Preserves integrity of individual right to exclude
  + Preserves confidence in the legal system (**meet people’s expectations**)
  + Role of the court vs. the legislature?

**Adverse Possession: From Trespass to Full Title**

**ADVERSE POSSESSION**

* Definition: Adverse possession allows title to transfer from the “true owner” to the adverse possessor when one possesses another’s land in a manner that is:
  + **Open and notorious**: possession must be visible to others (like enclosing with a fence).
  + **Actual**: the possessor must physically occupy the property in some manner that demonstrates engagement – land buildings, or paying property taxes suffices
  + **Exclusive**: Use is of the type expected by an exclusive owner
  + **Continuous for a period beyond the state statute of limitations**
    - **Tacking** doctrine: The adverse possession of predecessors in title counts towards the adverse possessor’s ownership.
  + **Adverse and hostile**: must be occupying the land without the true owner’s permission.
    - **Question re**: **permission**: does this jurisdiction have a **presumption of permissiveness** (presume that the owner permits third-party use) or a **presumption of non-permissiveness** (presumption that third-party use is adverse)?
    - Plus, there are a number of potential mental states required of the adverse possessor:
      * *Objective Test*: The court will not inquire into the state of mind of the adverse possessor.
        + Still must show that the defendant lacked permission to be on the land. [Moot if in jurisdiction with presumption of non-permissiveness] This is the law in the majority of states
      * *Subjective Tests:*
        + *Good Faith Test*:The adverse possessor can only make out a claim if she or he thought she or he was ***not on*** someone else’s land. Minority of states: Colorado, GA, NM, Iowa
        + *The Intentional Test*: The adverse possessor can only make out a claim if she or he was intentionally interfering with someone else’s possession; i.e. she or he knew it was someone else’s land and did it anyway. Minority of states: SC

**Policy Justifications for Adverse Possession**

* Economic justifications
  + Lower costs: in the long-run, making it less expensive to provide title.
    - Inability to prove ownership will increase transaction costs, and have a chilling effect on acquisition and conveyance of property.
    - Means that prospective owners will not need to conduct extensive inquiries into the status of title.
  + Efficient Use: the property should be used by those who value it most, and are willing to put it to work.
    - It protects the investment made by the adverse possessor, and increases their willingness to maintain value of their property.
* Moral justifications
  + The longer one holds a piece of property, the more it becomes a part of your persona (Radin)
  + Reliance: one comes to rely upon ownership of a particular piece of land

**Claim of Title** – when the person is acting with the intent to own the property

**Color of Title** actions

* An adverse possessor acquires color of title when a conveyance appears to meet the requirements of a valid transfer but in fact does not. Statutory period can be shorter in some jurisdictions because the possessor basically owns the land, but just there’s a defect in the deed

***Brown v. Gobble* (W. Va. 1996) – p.287** – elements of adverse possession; tacking doctrine

* **Facts:** The Gobble family buys their property in 1985, and are told that their property goes to the fence. The Browns purchased their adjacent property in 1989. Before purchase, the Browns were told that there was a two-foot tract between belonging to them fenced in by the Gobble family.
  + The plaintiffs then sued to reclaim the land.
* **Question:** Whether the Gobble family had taken adverse possession of the adjacent land fenced in.
* **Rule of Law:** Because the Gobbles meet each of the prongs of the adverse possession test, they adversely possessed the adjacent two feet of land originally owned by the Browns.
* Legal Reasoning:
  + **Actual Possession:** The Gobbles had actual possession of the land—it was fenced in and maintained by them.
  + **Hostile or adverse:** The land was fenced in 1937 by a predecessor to the Gobbles in ownership.
    - Applied the “objective test” in deciding that the court will look at the possessor’s actions and not inquire about their state of mind when taking possession.
  + **Open and notorious:** Called witnesses to testify that the possession was well-known in town when it was originally fenced in in 1937.
  + **Exclusive:** The fencing was never objected to by any previous owners, and it was used by the Gobbles
  + **Continuous:** Has been held continuously by the Gobbles’ predecessors in title since 1937. Therefore, adverse possession was taken by the previous ownership years before the Gobbles ever owned it.
    - **Tacking doctrine**: Even though the Gobbles only held adverse possession for 9.5 of the statutorily-required 10 years, the adverse possession of predecessors in title counts towards their adverse possession.

***Nome 2000 v. Fagerstrom* (Alaska 1990) – p.303** – whether seasonal use is sufficient to establish adverse possession

* **Facts:** Beginning in the 1970, the Fagerstroms, Alaska natives, began using the property as their own from June through September each year. This included recreational use, and the construction of cabins, picnic benches, and other small-scale items. An anthropologist, and many people present in the town testified at trial that their possession was consistent with ownership.
  + Nome 2000, the true owner sued to eject the Fagerstroms; the Fagerstroms countered that they had taken adverse possession of the property.
* **Question:** Whether the Fagerstroms had taken adverse possession of the land owned by Nome 2000 by their annual summer use.
* **Rule of Law:** Because the Fagerstroms meet all the elements of adverse possession by the objective test, they have taken adverse possession.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + Nome 2000 alleges that the Fagerstroms did not do enough to improve the property in order to take adverse possession in a continuous, exclusive, and notorious fashion.
    - Not based upon how significant or substantial an improvement is; rather the question is whether, under the circumstances, it is reasonable to understand improvements as possession.
  + The Fagerstroms met each prong of the adverse possession test.
    - **Exclusive:** Annual use throughout the warmer seasons, including the improvements made, are more significant than mere casual use.
    - **Continuous:** Used with consistency for the statutory period in question
    - **Open and notorious:** any serious effort to investigate the premises for signs of use would have revealed the Fagerstrom’s use
    - **Hostile or adverse:** Applies the “objective test” to show that the Fagerstroms used the land as if they actually owned it.
    - **Actual Possession:** There isn’t sufficient evidence on the record to show what the Fagerstroms actually possessed, and what they did not.
      * Because they met each of the other elements of adverse possession, this is remanded for the trial court to decide.

**Prescriptive Easements: From Trespass to Use Rights**

**Prescriptive Easements**

* Definition: if the scope of a non-owner’s possession is limited to a narrower use of the owner’s property, she may be granted a prescriptive easement.
  + Affirmative Easement: The right to engage in a particular use of another’s land.
    - Right of Way: the right to cross another’s land.
  + Negative Easement: The right to limit or block a particular use of another’s land.
* Factors for determining Prescriptive Easement
  + **Actual use or possession**;
  + **Open and notorious;**
  + **Adverse and Hostile;**
  + **Exclusivity is not required by most courts**
  + **Continuous For a period beyond the state statute of limitations**
  + **Acquiescence by the true owner required by some states.**
    - Whether this applies depends on the jurisdiction.

***Community Feed Store, Inc. v. Northeastern Culvert Corp.* (Vt. 1989) – p.315**

* **Facts:** Plaintiff operates a retail store selling animal feed. Behind the store is a gravel lot used by customers to pull in and out of the store. Vehicles would use the lot to come into the store and leave.
  + It was conclusively established that the defendant owned the bulk of the area used by the plaintiff om the basis of a new survey
  + Defendant sought to evict the plaintiff from the land. The Plaintiff sued for a declaration of prescriptive easement, and lost at trial.
* **Question:** Whether the plaintiff is entitled to prescriptive easement.
* **Rule of Law:** Because the plaintiff can establish all elements of adverse possession and because the use was consistent with a grant of easement, the plaintiff has met their burden in establishing prescriptive easement
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + The elements of prescriptive easement are coextensive with those of adverse possession; only difference is that adverse possession culminates in the acquisition of non-fee interest.
    - Where it is claimed, it must be shown through the **extent of actual occupation** and **use.** Burden of proof to show actual use
      * Extent of use doesn’t have to be proven with absolute precision, but **general outlines** must be consistent with the pattern of use throughout the prescriptive period.
      * Here the case was clear that the plaintiff had used the area in a manner **generally consistent with granting an easement.**
  + Elements of prescriptive easement
    - Open and notorious: if this is established, then it will be considered adverse possession.
      * Established here: has been used by vehicles of all kinds since 1920.
    - Hostile and continuous: Under doctrine of “tacking,” the use and chain of title dating back to 1920 is sufficient to establish prescriptive easement.
* Notes:
  + Some states require the claimant of prescriptive easement to claim **acquiescence**.
    - Definition differs: in some states it means that the landowner must have known and passively allowed it. In others it must mean the owner never objected.
  + Presumption of permissiveness rather than adverse in some states (making it harder to claim adverse possession)

***United States on Behalf of the Zuni Tribe of N.M. v. Platt* (D. Ariz. 1990) – CW –** using property law after dispossession; plaintiffs are asking for limited and periodic use every four years

* **Facts:** Plaintiff Tribe has been making a religious pilgrimage across Arizona for at least a century, and by some accounts since the 1500s.
  + The defendant now seeks to exclude the plaintiffs from his land. The United States intervened as plaintiff to seek a prescriptive easement for the tribe.
  + It is well known that the plaintiffs have been making this pilgrimage for decades on a regular basis.
* **Question:** Whether the plaintiff is entitled to prescriptive easement in order to complete their religious ritual.
* **Rule of Law:** Because each element of adverse possession is fulfilled here, the Zuni Tribe is entitled to prescriptive easement.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + Prescriptive Easement requires that possession be (1) actual; (2) open and notorious; (3) hostile; (4) under a claim of right; (5) continuous for the statutory period of at least 10 years.
    - Must prove all of these things, but their burden is lower because they are asking for limited and periodic use every four years.
    - **Actual:** Have possession of the land every four years when they conduct the pilgrimage because they recognize no other right to the land
    - **Continuous for Statutory Period**: They have used the land every four years for a long time (at least since the 1920s)
    - **Open and Notorious:** Well-known within Mr. Platt’s community. Court infers that he would have been aware of it.
    - **Hostile:** during the period, claims exclusive rights, and denies the true owner title.
      * Fulfilled here: coerced the owners to create gates in their land such that they were bound to respect the pilgrimage.
    - **Claim of right:** intent to appropriate the land and use as one’s own.
    - **Exclusive:** So long as they are using it for pilgrimage, nobody else can.

***Davis v. Evans* (Mo. 1853) – CW -** the law applies to different people differently, and systematically privileges some while dehumanizing others

* **Facts:** Free black woman had had a daughter while enslave. Mother attempted to claim ownership over her daughter through adverse possession. The claim was based on the fact that daughter lived with, was cared for, and was made to work by the mother. The master responded that the enslaved daughter lived with her mother at “his charity.”
* **Issue:** Who had title to the woman’s child? Whether a free black woman can assert ownership over her daughter, a slave, and prevent her from being taken by a man who bought her years earlier, on a theory of adverse possession.
* **Holding:** The master had title to the child, not the mother.
* **Reasoning:** Children of slaves are slaves.

**The *Uston* Outlier and Public Accommodations Law**

**LIMITS ON THE RIGHT TO EXCLUDE**

**Sources of Public Accommodations Law**

* Federal Statutes
* State Law
* Common Law

**Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. §1981)** – p.45 – can recover **damages**

* §1981. Equal Rights Under the Law
  + (a) *Statement of Equal Rights*. All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to **make and enforce contracts**, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.
  + (b) *“Make and Enforce Contracts” Defined*. For purposes of this section, the term “make and enforce contracts” includes the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.
  + (c) *Protection Against Impairment*. The rights protected by this section are protected against impairment by nongovernmental discrimination and impairment under color of State law.
* §1982. Property Rights of Citizens
  + All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.

Building a Claim based on the Civil Rights Act of 1866

* There are major differences with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
  + Successful claims can recover damages.
  + Only governs racial discrimination and ethnic origin.
  + Statute states its goals with greater clarity than the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
  + It can encapsulate a greater variety of establishments than the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
* Elements of a Claim
  + A party **making or seeking to enforce a** **contract** is guaranteed **equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of all property**.
* Difficulties with application
  + We don’t understand full scope of applicability of the statute
    - *Watson v. Fraternal Order of Eagles –* private club found to have violated § 1981 when it refused to serve drinks to black guests at a club party
    - *Cornelius v. Benevolent Protective Order of the Elks* – an irrevocable conflict between a statute that authorizes conduct and one that prohibits it must be adjudicated by applying the later act 🡪 § 1981 could not be applied to a private club
    - But there is some question of whether it applies to public accommodations: a public accommodations law was passed 9 years after original passage of the bill.
  + Limited applicability in some ways: makes it illegally discriminatory to exclude shoppers from stores, but permits racially-discriminatory surveillance
  + NOTE: To state a claim under § 1981 in the retail context, the plaintiff must demonstrate the loss of an actual, not speculative or prospective, contract interest -- an actual attempt to contract that was thwarted by the merchant. The court will not recognize claims with respect to conduct occurring after the consummation of the sales contract. – *Arguello v. Conoco*

**3-prong test for what plaintiff must show to prove violation of §1981**

1. Plaintiff must establish that she is a member of a racial minority
2. Defendant had intent to discriminate on the basis of race
3. Discrimination concerned one or more of the activities enumerated in statute

**Building a Claim based on the Civil Rights Act of 1964** (Section 2000a, Title II) – p.44 – can seek **injunctive relief, NO damages**

* Substantive Elements
  + **Denial of full and equal** enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations,
  + In a place of **public accommodation**, as defined in §2000(b);
    - There is a statutory interpretation question as to whether §2000(b) is illustrative or exhaustive.
      * *Denny v. Elizabeth Arden Salons, Inc.*, 456 F.3d 427 (4th Cir. 2006) holds that the list is exhaustive, and should not be held to limit non-enumerated businesses, but a NJ court held otherwise in *Sellers v. Phillips Barber Shop*, 217 A.2d 121 (N.J. 1966).
      * Textualist: there are catch-all phrases built into the statute.
      * Purposivism: The clear intent of the law was to stem discrimination
  + With **discrimination or segregation**,
    - There is a question whether this law requires discriminatory intent or disparate impact
      * *Tex. Dep't of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc.*, 135 S.Ct. 2507 (2015) and *Hardie v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass’n*, 876 F.3d 312 (9th Cir. 2017) both hold that disparate impact is required.
      * Textualist: “Equal access” has a clear, plain reading.
  + On the ground of **race, color, religion, national origins**;
    - DOES NOT protect gender or sexual orientation
  + In a place that is not a private club, unless open to the public.

Similarities between Civil Rights Act of 1866 and Civil Rights Act of 1964

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | **§ 1981 (1866)** | **Title II (1964)** |
| **Prohibited forms of discrimination?** | Disparate treatment claims only | Disparate treatment and disparate impact claims [open question: should the FHA tests apply?] |
| **Protected classes?** | Race | Race, color, national origin, religion |
| **Regulates private actors?** | Yes | Yes |
| **Regulates public accommodation?** | Unclear | Yes |
| **Damages available?** | Yes | No |

Does § 1981 prohibit discrimination by a private club? [Title II clearly does not]

*Cornelius* (no - CT)

* 1964, Congress authorized private clubs to discriminate in Title II
* In 1866, Congress prohibited private clubs from discriminating (or did not include a carve-out)
* Therefore, there is an irrevocable conflict that must be resolved by applying the later act

*Watson* (yes - 6th Circuit)

* Congress in 1964 explicitly did not repeal the earlier statutes - so it intended that the narrower statute would retain independent force
* Therefore, a plaintiff may bring a 1981 claim against a private club that is not covered under Title II

***Arguello v. Conoco (5th Cir. 2003)* - CW**

* **Facts:** plaintiffs (daughter and father) stopped at the defendant’s store to buy gasoline and other goods. They were subjected to racially discriminatory treatment by the store’s clerk. Plaintiffs brought the suit demanding both compensatory and injunctive relief.
* **Issue:** whether the plaintiffs have a valid claim for racial discrimination under § 1981
* **Rule:** to state a claim under § 1981 in the retail context, **the plaintiff must demonstrate the loss of an actual, not speculative or prospective, contract interest** -- an actual attempt to contract that was thwarted by the merchant. The court will not recognize claims with respect to conduct occurring after the consummation of the sales contract.
* **Reasoning:** Neither the father nor the daughter can establish that their attempt to contract was thwarted. The father voluntarily left the good on the counter and left not wanting to buy it. When he later tried to gain access to the store and was locked out, he wasn’t denied an opportunity to purchase because his intention was to determine the clerk’s identity, not to buy something. The daughter also does not have a valid claim because she was able to successfully complete the transaction.

**New York Executive Law – p.51 –** much more expansive than federal statutes

* Expansion of protected classes covered (e.g. sexual orientation, marital status)
* Expansion of prohibited conduct
* Disparate impact claims expressly cognizable (“To the effect of…”, “directly or indirectly)
* Specific definition of what constitutes a “private club”

***Boy Scouts of America v. Dale (2000)* (Supreme Court decision reversing Dale v. Boy Scouts of America (N.J. 1999)) -** Boy Scouts ban on gay scouts doesn’t violate public accommodations

* **Holding:** Boy Scouts ban on gay scouts does not violate public accommodations laws because “state interests embodied in New Jersey’s public accommodations law do not justify such a severe intrusion on the Boy Scouts’ rights to free of expressive association.”
* **Justifications:**
  + Protecting associational rights, not individual expectations

***Uston v. Resorts International Hotel, Inc.* N.J. 1982) – p.25** – outlier, Uston exception to common law of public accommodations

* **Facts:** Resorts International Hotel excluded the respondent, Uston, from its hotel and casino because he engaged in card counting. Uston contested the exclusion on the grounds that there was no common law or statutory right to exclude him for card counting.
* **Question:** Whether a private property owner has the absolute right to exclude one from their property.
* **Rule of Law:** “When a property owner opens his or her property to the general public in the pursuit of their own property interest, they have a duty not to act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner toward persons who come on their premises.”
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + The current majority rule is an absolute right to eject or exclude someone for any reason consistent with state and federal civil rights law.
  + When a private owner opens itself up to public use, it must accommodate the rights of the people who use that property.
    - Duty to be reasonable is applicable to all property owners that open themselves up to the public.
    - Uston did not threaten security, nor was he being disruptive; he should have full access.
* **Notes:**
  + **THIS IS NOT THE MAJORITY RULE**
    - When a property owner opens his or her property to the general public…they have the right to exclude others for any reason not specifically prohibited by federal laws, *PROVIDED:* the property is **not an inn or common carrier, which have a duty to serve the public.** (*Madden v. Queens*, N.Y. 1947)
      * The underlying rationale is that businesses like common carriers and inns serve monopolistic functions; therefore exclusion from one is total exclusion, which should be avoided.
    - The market should be allowed to determine who will enter/be excluded

**The Americans with Disabilities Act**

**Americans with Disabilities Act** (Key Excerpts) – p.62

**Building a Claim based on the Americans with Disabilities Act**

* Key factors to remember:
  + The statute is much broader: provides an enumerated list with a catch-all at the end.
  + The statute fully anticipates the argument related to discriminatory intent versus disparate impact.
    - *Intent* – the plaintiff is entitled to damages.
    - *Disparate Impact* – the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction and declaratory relief.
* **Substantive Elements - FRAMEWORK**
  + Is this a **disability** under §12102?
  + Is this a **place of public accommodation** under §12181(7)?
  + Is there **discrimination** under §12182?

***Bragdon v. Abbott* (1998) - CW**

* **Facts:** Sidney Abbott was infected with HIV in 1986. Abbott was informed by her dentist, Bragdon, that she would need to have a cavity filled. When Abbott informed him that she was HIV positive, Bragdon refused to fill the cavity in his office, and said that he would only do it in a hospital.
* ***Question:*** Whether an HIV infection is a disability under the ADA when the infection has not progressed to symptomatic AIDS.
* **Rule of Law:** Yes, because HIV represents a physical impairment that substantially limits the major life activity of reproduction, it is a disability.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + HIV is a physical impairment because it begins to affect the lymphic and hemic systems from the moment of birth.
  + The physical impairment must affect major life activities – here it affects her ability to reproduce.
    - Reproduction carries with it the major risk that her child or her sexual partner contract HIV – the court cannot ask her to run that risk.
  + The Court will not mandate that Bragdon provide treatment; the First Circuit must take fact-specific approach to determine the objective reasonableness of Bragdon’s fear of treating her
* **Notes:**
  + This opinion was criticized because it seems to narrowly permit the finding that HIV is a disability to people who are willing and able to reproduce; however it doesn’t apply to gays.

**The First Amendment**

**Standard: A facility that is built and operated primarily to benefit the public and whose operation is essentially a public function is a state actor for purposes of First/Fourteenth Amendment analysis.**

**BIG QUESTION:** What happens when someone is trying to access property to express their religious beliefs/exert their free speech rights?

**Overview: First Amendment**

* Has a state actor requirement
* Fourteenth Amendment extends this to state governments
* At what point does a private actor become a state actor for the purposes of First Amendment analysis?
  + *Marsh v. Alabama* (company-owned town) - A company town is functionally equivalent to a state actor, so allowing company managers to infringe on the rights of free expression in the town is a violation of the First Amendment.
    - Articulates two potential tests for determining whether an entity is a state actor:
      * Public Use: the more you open your doors to the public, the more circumscribed your right to exclude becomes (like *Uston*)
      * Public Function: the property becomes a state actor to the extent that it is taking on an essential public function usually reserved for the state
    - Why does a state actor have more duties than a private actor, generally?
      * Monopoly over force and facilities
      * Composite of a democratically-convened group of people
      * Settled expectations/reliance interests
  + *Lloyd v. Tanner* – shopping mall did not engage in state action. Invitation to the public to transact business at a shopping center did not dedicate private property to public use that entitled exercise of First Amendment rights unrelated to the shopping center’s operation. Narrowing of *Marsh*
    - Unlike *Marsh*, the mall did not take on all the attributes of a company town
    - *Lloyd* essentially overrules *Logan Valley* – rule is now a very strict public function test
  + *Praeger University v. Google* – YouTube does not take on a “public function” as a platform for media, so it is not a state actor.
    - Narrow reading of *Marsh* – there’s a very high bar for an action to be considered a “public function”; Praeger unsuccessfully attempting to put spin on *Marsh* by calling YouTube a “public forum”

***Marsh v. Alabama* (1946) – CW –** privately-owned town

* **Underlying Facts:** The town of Chicksaw, AL was owned entirely by Gulf Shipbuilding. Aside from the fact of ownership of all the land, and the employment of all residents, it functioned as a normal town. Marsh, a Jehovah’s Witness was distributing religious literature in the town. The company asked her to leave, but she refused, and was arrested for trespassing.
* **Question:** Whether a company that owns and runs a company town is a “state actor”
* **Holding:** A company town is functionally equivalent to a state actor. Thus allowing company managers to infringe on the rights of free expression in the town is a violation of the First Amendment.
* **Reasoning:**
  + Neither a state nor a municipality can bar distribution of literature containing religious or political ideas on the streets, sidewalks or other public places.
  + The fact that the town is owned entirely by a private actor makes no difference – it works on a sliding scale: “the more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it.”
    - State actors have monopolies on coercion in important public spaces – people cannot opt out and chose an alternative.
  + Balancing rights of property owners with the rights enjoyed by the people living in a company town, the rights of the people to free expression and religion occupy the preferred position.
* **Notes:**
  + There is an open question as to whether this articulates a *Public Use* or a *Public Function* test in determining whether an entity is a state actor:
    - Public Use: the more you open your doors to the public, the more circumscribed your right to exclude becomes (like Uston)
    - Public Function: the property becomes a state actor to the extent that it is taking on an essential public function usually reserved for the state.
  + Why does a state actor have more duties than a private actor (generally)?
    - Monopoly over force and facilities
    - Composite of a democratically-convened group of people
    - Settled expectations/reliance interests

**Lloyd Corp., Ltd. v. Tanner (1972) – p.65 – shopping mall**

* **Facts**: A private citizen was distributing handbills in a public shopping mall in protest of the Vietnam War, when a security guard informed them that they were prohibited from distributing handbills in the center. The plaintiff refused to leave, and was subsequently removed
  + They subsequently sued the mall, alleging that the mall served a “Public Function,” and was consequently unable to restrict patrons’ First Amendment Rights.
* **Question:** Whether a shopping mall engaged in State Action under the “Public Function” test.
* **Rule of Law:** Invitation to the public to transact business at a shopping center did not dedicate private property to public use that entitled exercise of First Amendment rights unrelated to the shopping center’s operation.
  + *Lloyd* essentially overrules *Logan Valley* [Court extended rationale of *Marsh* to peaceful picketing by a union of a store located in a large shopping center] – rule is now a very strict public function test
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + Uninvited guests have no right to exercise free speech on private property, and the mall is essentially private.
    - Unlike *Marsh*, the mall did not take on all the attributes of a company town.
    - Property does not lose its private character just because the public is invited inside.
* **Other Opinions:** *Marshall Dissenting* – when the mall opens itself to the public, it must subject itself to further regulation.
  + Lloyd’s served a public function, akin to a public square: it satisfied all of its residents’ needs.
  + In relative terms, Lloyd’s has a much smaller interest in policing the speech of its residents.

***Praeger University v. Google LLC* (N.D. Cal. Mar. 26, 2018) – CW -** Youtube

* Facts: Plaintiff, a conservative media outlet, alleges that the Defendant, YouTube, discriminated against Praeger on the basis of its conservative viewpoint. Specifically, plaintiff alleges that it placed age restrictions on the plaintiff’s videos in a discriminatory fashion.
  + Plaintiff sues, alleging that the defendant is a state actor under the “public function” test, and therefore cannot curtail its First Amendment Rights.
* Question: Does YouTube have the right to exclude speakers on its platform?
* Rule of Law: Yes, because YouTube does not take on a “public function” as a platform for television, it is not a state actor.
* Legal Reasoning:
  + The court reads *Marsh* holding narrowly – state actor is one that runs a town
  + There is a very high bar for an action to be considered a “public function.” : akin to holding public elections or “governing a town.”
    - YouTube is a *private* company providing a platform for videos and must be allowed to self-regulate
    - In light of the *Lloyd Corp.* holding, there is no cause of action.
* Praeger argument: Putting spin on *Marsh* – calling YouTube a “public forum” (court does not buy this argument)

**The Public Trust Doctrine**

**Principles of Public Trust Doctrine**

* Duties of a Public Trust
  + Must be held available for use by the general public;
  + Must not be sold;
  + Must be maintained for particular types of uses.
* Deciding if a property is a Public Trust:
  + **Is the property within the public domain?**
    - Lands covered by tidal waters (Early1800s)
    - Wet-sand of the beach (Early 1800s)
    - Lands covered by fresh waters (*Illinois Central Railroad v. Illinois, 1892* – Supreme Court held that ownership of/dominion over lands covered by tide waters belong to the states - subject to the paramount right of Congress to control their navigation so far as may be necessary for the regulation of commerce)
    - Dry-sand of beaches owned by a municipality (*Neptune City v. Avon*, N.J. 1972. Contrast with Massachusetts, which has limited public access to tidal lands, not the dry sand area)
    - Dry-sand of beaches owned by a non-profit charitable association/quasi-public body (*Matthews v. Bay Head Improvement*, N.J. 1984)
    - Ambient air, wild flora, fauna (*Robinson v. Penn.*, Pa. 2013, see FN 10 in *Juliana*, 2016)
  + Deciding on whether to apply public trust doctrine:
    - **Type of resource:**
      * Scarce/important: Is the resource necessary for the enjoyment of an existing public trust asset and, when combined, create a unique, irreplaceable resource that is in limited supply? (*Matthews v. Bay Head Improvement Ass’n*, N.J. 1972)
      * Fairness
      * State actor
  + **Type of entity:**
    - State government
    - Municipal government (See *Avon*)
    - A quasi-public entity? (See *Matthews*)
    - The Federal government? (See *Juliana*)
* Notes: Public Trust doctrine is dynamic, not static
  + *Matthews v. Bay Head Improvement Association* - Because the dry sand beach is in the public trust, and the Bay Head Improvement Association is a quasi-public entity, it can’t restrict access.
    - The court has already ruled that the public has a right to access and use wet sand beaches; extending the public domain to dry sand beaches allows them to access the wet sand within the public trust.
    - If a resource is within the public trust (e.g. wet beaches), the public must be able to access it (by having access to dry beaches). “Reasonable access”
    - Oregon relies on custom to hold that longstanding reasonable use of a beachfront by the public for recreational purposes conferred continuing rights of access

Building out a Public Trust claim:

1. Is the asset/resource subject to public trust? Is the property in the public domain?
2. Has the entity violated one of the fiduciary duties of the trust?
3. Is the title owner an entity against which a court can enforce trust duties?

***Matthews v. Bay Head Improvement Ass’n* (N.J. 1984) – p.72** – public trust doctrine is dynamic, NOT fixed or static

* **Facts:** The sand beach in Bay Head is owned by the public, but the Bay Head Improvement Association owns all the plots surrounding the public beach. It charges an annual fee for membership, and pays lifeguards and for the beach’s maintenance. It also restricts daytime access to the beach to those paying annual membership. Membership is only open to residents of the town of Bay Head.
  + The plaintiff in this case is a non-resident denied access to the beach and admittance to the Association.
* **Question:** Whether the public has a right to access and use the beach through the quasi-public body.
* **Rule of Law:** Because the dry sand beach is in the public trust, and the Bay Head Improvement Association is essentially a public body, it cannot restrict access.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + The court has already ruled that the public has a right to access and use wet sand beaches; extending the public domain to dry sand beaches allows them to access the wet sand within the public trust.
  + If a property is within the public trust, the public must be able to access it. “Reasonable access”
  + The Improvement Association is essentially a public entity performing a public function.
    - Because of its public nature, it cannot restrict access to only Bay Head residents
* **Notes:**
  + New test formulation:
    - Is this essential to domain access?
    - Is it “Unique, irreplaceable, limited”?
    - Is the private owner acting essentially as a public one?

***Juliana v. United States* (D.Or. 2016) - CW**

* **Facts:** The plaintiffs are a group of teenagers alleging that the United States has known for 50 years that CO2 has a destabilizing effect on the planet’s climate, and yet has done nothing. They seek a declaration that the atmosphere is a public trust, and thus that their rights have been violated, and an order to stop further CO2 polution.
* **Question:** Whether the atmosphere is a public trust.
* **Rule of Law:** While the court is unwilling to rule on whether the atmosphere is a public trust, it does rule that oceans are a public trust
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + Land beneath tidal waters has repeatedly been held to be a public trust asset.
    - Allowing further pollution may deny future use and access to the oceans.
  + The public trust doctrine applies to the federal government as well as states.
    - While the doctrine has traditionally been held to apply just to states, there is no principled reason not to apply it to the federal government.

**UNIT 3: THE POWER TO SHARE IN SPACE AND TIME**

**Themes:**

* Property law as governing relationships between people
* The state’s role in the regulation of these relationships – clear set of categories and rules
* Real-world consequences in these categories and rules: what’s at stake here?

**Concurrent Tenancies**

Right to share can be voluntary or involuntary.

Concurrent ownership – owners can benefit from the same space at the same time

General Background

* Rights and Responsibilities of cotenants
  + **Possession:** each co-owner has the right to possess the entire parcel.
    - If one co-owner chooses not to live on the common property, and the other does, the other co-owner does not owe rent.
    - Duty to pay rent only arises if the co-owner commits an ouster, an explicit act by which one co-owner excludes the others from the joint property.
  + **Profits:** entitled to share any rents or profits from the property.
  + **Burdens:** must share responsibility on the maintenance and repairs of the property.
    - Co-tenants don’t have the obligation to share in the expense of improvements.
    - Exception: if one co-owner possesses all of the property, they are responsible for all of the repairs.
* Three types of concurrent tenancy
  + **Tenancy in Common:** \*\*The **default** tenancy status\*\*
    - *Alienability:* Each co-tenant only has the authority to sell their portion.
    - Can file for dividing the property and proceeds from sale through *partition*.
    - Each tenant, no matter the size of their fractional interest, has the right to possession.
      * *Olivas v. Olivas* – each co-tenant has the right to possess entire property. The obligation of the occupying co-tenant may arise in the absence of “actual ouster” [actual ouster usually requires an affirmative physical act]—constructive ouster [where the emotional impact of a divorce makes it effectively impractical for the parties to live together; typically no fault of either party
    - Duty of each tenant to pay basic costs if they all live on the property
    - Financed with a single mortgage.
    - Can be divided unequally among multiple people.
    - Partition: action to terminate co-tenancy and divide the property or its proceeds
      * *Partition in kind:* Court may order the property physically divided among the co-owners.
      * *Partition* *by sale*: If partition in kind is not feasible or appropriate, the court will order the property to be sold and the proceeds divided among the co-owners in proportion to their ownership shares
        + *Ark Land Co. v. Harper* – presumption against partition for sale. Economic value is not the exclusive test for determining whether to partition in kind or by sale – sentimental/emotional interests should also be considered

Rule: Default to partition in kind, but courts may order sale and if (1) the property cannot be conveniently partitioned in kind, (2) the interests of one or more parties will be promoted by the sale, and (3) the interests of the other parties will not be prejudiced by the sale. Must weight economic and emotional value.

* + - * Heirs’ property – land that lacks a clear title because it’s been passed down informally through many generations without a will. Descendants become part-owners regardless of whether they pay the taxes or even set foot on the property.
        + Widespread across SC and other Southern states, this form of land ownership disproportionately affects black families
        + Heirs’ property can easily slip away from a family when a single relative with a small share of ownership forces the liquidation of the entire property in a partition sale
    - **Policy justifications:**
      * Fairness/settled expectations
      * Efficiency – creating incentives for collaboration
  + **Joint Tenancy:** Similar to the tenancy in common, but a joint tenancy has no right to survivorship
    - When a joint tenant dies, her ownership is transferred to the remaining joint tenants in equal shares.
    - This is the most popular form of ownership among families because it doesn’t require a will. Usually equal interests in the land.
    - Four things must be present in order to establish a joint tenancy:
      * Interests of joint tenants must be created **at the same moment in time.**
      * Joint tenants must acquire the **same instrument or title.**
      * All joint tenancies must last for **an equal fraction** of the divided interest.
      * All joint tenants must have an equal right to possess the entire parcel.
    - The presumption is against joint tenancy, so a conveyance must explicitly establish joint tenancy. Must be specified.
      * Conveyance usually has the effect of destroying joint tenancy, and turning it to a tenancy in common
  + **Tenancy by Entirety:** only available to married couples
    - Right of survivorship
    - Spouses cannot encumber tenancy by entirety property without their spouse’s consent.

**SUMMARY OF TYPES OF CONCURRENT TENANCIES**

**![](data:image/png;base64...)**

***Olivas v. Olivas* (N.M. Ct. App. 1989) – p.673** – each joint tenant has the right to possess entire property; constructive ouster (vs. traditional ouster – affirmative physical act)

* **Facts:** Husband moved out of house after separation. The party eventually divorced. He sought to recover rent from ex-wife on the theory that he is a tenant in common and is entitled to his share of the property value because he was constructively ousted.
* **Issue:** whether the lower court erred in finding that the husband was not constructively ousted and thus not entitled to payments from ex-wife
* **Holding:** no, upheld the lower court’s holding
* **Rule:** the obligation of the occupying co-tenant to pay rent may arise in the absence of “actual” ouster when the realities of the situation, without there being any fault by either co-tenant, prevent the co-tenants from sharing occupancy. In the marital context, when the emotions of a divorce make it impossible for the parties to occupy the same residence together, there may be an ouster in effect.
* **Court’s analysis:** The husband chose to leave and live with a girlfriend and was thus not forced out, which did not compel a finding of constructive ouster.
  + **Justification:** Fairness (who needs it more? Who values it more?) and efficiency

***Ark Land Co. v. Harper* (W. Va. 2004) – p.691** – presumption against partition for sale (presumption of partition in kind). Economic value not the exclusive test; sentimental/emotional interests should also be considered

* **Facts:** Dispute involving tract of land exclusively owned by family for 100 years. In 2001 Ark acquired 67.5% interest in the land from several family members to use for mining. None of family lived on land. Ark tried to buy remaining interests from heirs, but they refused to sell to Ark. Ark filed a complaint seeking land partitioned and sold. In response, family sought partition in kind (physical division of property).
* **Issue:** Whether economic value should be the exclusive test for determining partition in kind or sale?
* **Holding:** No partition. Economic value of property is not exclusive test for deciding whether to partition in kind or by sale. The evidence of long-standing ownership coupled with sentimental or emotional interests in property may also be considered in deciding whether interests of party opposing sale will be prejudiced by property's sale. Presumption towards partition in kind. Partition by sale is undesirable because if one party opposes, the cash may not be fair compensation for loss of property.
* **Rule:** Default to partition in kind, but courts may order sale and proceeds divided if (1) the property cannot be conveniently partitioned in kind, (2) the interests of one or more parties will be promoted by the sale, and (3) the interests of the other parties will not be prejudiced by the sale. Must weight economic and emotional value.
* NOTE: Heirs’ property (news article assigned) – land that lacks a clear title because it’s been passed down informally through many generations without a will. Descendants become part-owners regardless of whether they pay the taxes or even set foot on the property.
  + Widespread across SC and other Southern states, this form of land ownership disproportionately affects black families
  + Heirs’ property can easily slip away from a family when a single relative with a small share of ownership forces the liquidation of the entire property in a partition sale

**Spouses & Unmarried Partners**

Marital Property

* Historical systemic evolution of property system
  + **Coverture:** historical property scheme.
    - Husband and wife are treated as a single person in the eyes of the law.
      * Husband can convey land without his wife’s consent but not other way around.
      * Husband’s debts can be settled using his wife’s property.
    - Same rules as tenancy by entirety, except in the modern world women have more rights.
  + **Married Women’s Property Acts**: abolished the coverture system
    - Tenancy by entirety is still allowed in the modern form, however it is a reciprocal form rather than unilateral.
      * Wives’ property cannot be alienated by husband without their consent.
  + **Same-Sex Marriage:** *United States v. Windsor* (2013) and *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015) used the right to pass on property free of unfair encumbrance as a principal justification for same-sex marriage.
* Separate vs. Communal property systems
  + **Separate Property:** **Majority Rule**
    - Spouses own their respective property separately, except to the extent they choose to share it or mingle it with their spouse’s property.
      * *Marriage*: all property is earned and kept separately.
      * *Divorce*: equitable distribution of property owned by each party on divorce based on a variety of factors (economic need, status, contributions of the respective parties)
        + Provisions exist to provide alimony too.
      * *Death:* may dispose of property by will, but widow can override the will and get a statutorily provided portion of the property (1/3 to ½)
  + **Community Property:**
    - All property is owned in equal part by the spouses.
      * *Marriage:* all earnings are communal.
      * *Divorce:* Allocated mechanically by giving the spouses their discrete halves.
      * *Death:* Spouse disposes of property by will; one half mechanically goes to spouse.
* Premarital Agreements: divide property ownership between spouses *ex ante*.
  + Enforced unless unconscionable, or otherwise against public policy.

***O’Brien v. O’Brien* (N.Y. 1985) – p.706 –** what constitutes marital property?

* **Facts:** The plaintiff and defendant are husband and wife. The wife moved to Mexico, and supported her husband financially while he attended medical school. In doing so, she gave up the possibility of earning a teaching certification and obtaining professional advancement. Shortly after he obtained his medical license, and began his residency, he moved out and asked for a divorce.
  + She sued, claiming that her husband’s medical license is marital property.
* **Question:** Whether a medical license is marital property.
* **Rule of Law:** Because a medical license represents the outcome of joint investment in the marriage, and fits well within the definition provided by statute, it is property.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + An interest in a profession or professional career can be marital property.
    - The state statute defining property can easily be read to encompass a medical license.
      * Even though it is not alienable, it has significant value, and contributes to husband’s future earning capacity.
  + Husband claims that it represents a personal achievement, and is not property.
    - When both spouses contribute to the marriage, the outcome is generally recognized as their joint property.
      * Wife contributed 76% of their income.
* **Other Opinions:** *Meyer Concurring* – there is a potential unfairness in awarding damages on the basis of estimated future earnings, when he is still in training.
  + Damages were assessed assuming that he would become a general surgeon, when in fact, it is unclear that he wants to be one at all.
* **Notes:**
  + This case is a singular outlier – no other state has held that licenses are marital property.
  + **Policy arguments against majority decision:**
    - Efficiency/administrability: this will open up arguments and potential confusion about what counts as property in the first place
    - Fairness: this will lock husband into a career

***Watts v. Watts* (2015) – p.717 –** what about unmarried partners?

* **Facts:** The plaintiff and defendant cohabitated, had kids, and presented themselves to the world as a married couple for 14 years, even though they never actually got married. The wife took the husband’s last name, quit her job, and contributed to homemaking.
  + She now sues for equitable distribution of assets, which her husband has refused since their relationship ended.
* **Question:** Whether a partner is entitled to half of her partner’s assets under a contract or quasi-contract claim, even though they were never actually married.
* **Rule of Law:** Because there was separate consideration beyond an illicit sexual relationship, a contract claim can go forward. Because denying her a share in the profit would be manifestly unjust under the circumstances, the plaintiff should be allowed to pursue a quasi-contract claim as well.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + Contract claim can be enforced
    - A contract cannot be enforced if it is based exclusively on an illicit sexual relationship, but illicit sexual relationship is not a bar.
    - Plaintiff quit her job and abandoned her career based on defendant’s promises to take care of her.
      * Also provided significant household assistance.
    - This is enough to find consideration.
  + Quasi-Contract claim can also move forward.
    - Unjust enrichment happens when the plaintiff provides a benefit, and the defendant accepts it where such would be considered unjust.
    - Plaintiff contributed financial resources as well as her own; denying her an equal share would be unjust under the circumstances.
  + Partition is fair under the circumstances.

**Estates & Rules of Interpretation**

How do you share property over time? Or arrange for consecutive ownership?

![](data:image/png;base64...)

Basic Vocabulary

* Temporal Vocabulary
  + Present/Possessory Estate: the right of present possession.
    - Not preceded by any other interest; and
    - Not subject to any conditions precedent.
  + Future Interest: a legal interest that presently exists, but does not entitle the owner to possession until a time in the future, and cannot cut short or divest the preceding possessory or vested estate.
    - Types of future interest:
      * Reversion: when the grantor of the estate holds the future interest.
      * Remainder: when the future interest is held by a third party (not the grantor).
  + Contingent Remainder exists if
    - It is created in an unascertained or unborn person; or
    - It is subject to a condition precedent other than natural termination of the preceding possessory estate.
  + Vested Remainder: it is created in a known person, and has no conditions precedent other than termination of the preceding possessory estate.
    - Vested Remainder Subject to Divestment: created in a known person, but could be prevented from ever becoming possessory by a different future interest.
    - Vested Remainder Subject to Open: a vested remainder that could be diluted by the addition of new members of a class of persons entitled to it.
* Quantum of Estate
  + Fee Simple Absolute: A present possessory interest that continues forward in perpetuity.
    - Conveyance language: “to A” or “to A and her heirs”

      * CANNOT convey a fee simple interest, but they can sell the life estate.
  + Defeasible Fee: an estate that can be divested or cut short by a future interest.
    - Fee Simple Determinable: a future interest that cuts short the prior estate is created in the Grantor using words of duration (there is a *possibility of reverter*)
      * “O gives this land to the school board, *as long as* it is used as a school.”
      * Words of duration: as long as, during, until, while
    - Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent: a future interest that cuts short the prior estate is created in the Grantor using words of condition (there is a *right of entry*).
      * “O gives this land to the school board, *so long as* it is used as a school.”
      * This interest is created with words of condition – there is a contingency.
      * Words of condition: provided that, on condition, but if
    - Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitations: a future interest that cuts short or divests a prior interest is created in a Grantee.
      * Springing Executory Interest: an executory interest that divests an estate held by the grantor.
      * Shifting Executory Interest: an executory interest that divests an estate held by another grantee.
        + “O gives this land to O, but if B ever marries, to B.”
      * Words of duration or condition: until (or unless)…, then to… ; but if…, then to…
* Miscellaneous
  + Cy Pres: **The doctrine of cy pres**, or equitable reformation, permits a court to modify a grant (if original purposes as exactly described are no longer feasible) to validate it on the presumption that this is consistent with the intent of the grantor. Especially relevant when it comes to charitable
    - Burden on the party seeking reformation to prove that the donor had a general charitable intent. Modern trend is to presume general charitable intent. Many courts (contrary to Evans) reform trusts that illegally restricted benefits on the basis of race or sex.
  + Trust: Device in estate [lanning today that enables grantors to arrange their assets in a way that maximizes flexibility and property management by leaving property to future generations
  + Precatory: Non-legally-binding language
* Does the transfer violate any of the **Major Estate Rules**?
  + Does this vioate the **Presumption Against Forfeiture**?
    - **Majority Rule:** when deciding whether ambiguous language in a will should be read as fee simple absolute, and a life estate, **choose fee simple**
      * Most courts hold that intent-based language is precatory (i.e. not meant to have any legal significance)
    - Alternate rule **Grantor’s Intent should be honored**, regardless of the type of estate it creates. *Edwards v. Bradley* (VA)
  + Has the possessor of a life estate violated the **Doctrine of Waste**?
    - Is there **Voluntary Waste** (deliberate acts) or **Permissive Waste** (an act of omission)?
      * Most states allow damages and reversion if there is Voluntary Waste, but only damages if the waste is Permissive.
      * Voluntary waste can be proven if the life tenant life tenant **failed to exercise ordinary care for the preservation of the property.** *McIntyre v. Scarbrough*
  + Does it violate the **Rule Against Creation of New Estates**?
    - If a conveyance does not fit within any of the established estate categories (fee simple absolute, fee simple absolute subject to conditions, defeasible fees, life estates, leaseholds, fee tails), then it must be interpreted to fit within an existing estate-type. *Johnson v. Whiton*
  + Does it violate the **Rule Against Restraints on Alienation**?
    - There is a strong presumption that property owners should be able to transfer their land.
      * Total prohibition on alienation is not allowed; nor is preconditioned approval by a third party. *Northwest Real Estate Co. v. Serio*
      * **Exception:** if the owner is within a **common-interest development**, restraints are given the **strong presumption of validity** *Woodside Village Condo Ass’n, Inc. v. Jahren*
  + Does it violate the **Rule Against Racial Restrictions**?
    - Covenants restraining the ownership, use, or enjoyment of land by racial and ethnic minorities are prohibited. *Shelley v. Kraemer*
    - This should be applied **only in circumstances where there is clear disparate treatment**. *Evans v. Abney*

***Edwards v. Bradley* (Va. 1984)** – presumption against forfeiture; grantor’s intent

* **Facts:** Viva Parker Lilliston died and included in her will a provision leaving the estate to Jones, but forbidding sale of the estate in order to pay creditors. Edwards attempted to have her husband and children sign a waiver allowing her to sell the farm, but Beverly Bradley refused.
  + When Jones died, she left each child an equal share in the family farm, except Bradley, who she left $1. Bradley sued alleging that she had a future interest, and that Edwards was initially given a life estate.
* **Question:** Whether the testatrix devised a fee simple estate or a life estate in real property.
* **Rule of Law:** Because the conditional limitation indicated that the children were to take over the farm after their mother’s death this should be construed as a life estate.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + In Virginia, there is no presumption against alienability; rather the rule is that the will should be construed to most faithfully execute the *grantor’s intent*.
  + Experienced attorneys drafted the agreement., using “fee simple” throughout the will, but not in that section (absence is demonstrative of intent).
  + Future interest vested in children – showed that she intended that they would inherit the property eventually.
* **Note:** This demonstrates the minority rule – most states use the presumption against forfeiture.
  + Separate note: Courts are eager to find a future interest when the property is donated for charitable purposes.

***McIntyre v. Scarbrough* (Ga. 1996) – p.764** – doctrine of waste

* **Facts:** McIntyre sold her land to Scarbrough, but kept 1.2 acres of the land for herself as a part of a life estate, and lived there in a mobile home. The Scarbroughs brought a claim of waste to end McIntyre’s life tenancy on the grounds that she had left her mobile home in a state of severe disrepair.
* **Question:** Whether McIntyre forfeited her life estate in the property due to waste.
* **Rule of Law:** Because the evidence conclusively established that the life tenant failed to exercise ordinary care for the preservation of the property, she forfeited her interest in the estate.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + Theory of occupancy – McIntyre is no longer living there per the conditions set forth
  + Doctrine of waste – McIntyre didn’t keep up the property per the conditions, so her life estate is extinguished.
  + A life tenant is entitled to their estate, provided they take reasonable and ordinary care, and does not do anything to unreasonably harm the remainder interest.
    - In this case, the defendant failed to pay her taxes on the property, which was enough to forfeit her interest in the estate.
* **Other Opinions:** *Dissent –* the damage was unintentional; must be intentional in order to constitute waste.

**Restrictions on Trusts & Estates**

***Evans v. Abney* (1970) – p.770** – rule against racial restrictions

* **Facts:** Georgia Senator Bacon left his estate to his home city of Macon for the creation of a public park, on the grounds that the park remain for the exclusive use of its white citizens. The Supreme Court determined that the park is not allowed to be segregated on that basis. The Court remanded it to the State Courts to determine Senator Bacon’s intention in bequeathing his estate.
* **Question:** Whether Senator Bacon’s principle intention in bequeathing his estate can be fulfilled, given that the racial restrictions are unconstitutional.
* **Holding (J. Black):** Not a violation of the 14th Amendment to allow reversion to Bacon’s descendants because reversion is automatic. No court needed to enforce/intervene, so it is not really state action.
  + No state action in reluctance to do equitable reformulation under cy pres because no constitutionally protected rights directly violated by the refusal to reform the trust and allow automatic reversion.
  + Court not motivated by racial discrimination – sole intention was to “effectuate as nearly as possible the explicit terms of Senator Bacon’s will.
  + Unlike *Shelley*, eliminating the park was a loss “shared equally by the white and Negro citizens.”
  + Georgia courts treating park as fee simple determinable with automatic reversion to honor grantor’s intent. Charitable purpose so not going to read language/magic words as precatory.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + Georgia Courts are entrusted with carrying out the intentions of a will.
    - The *cy pres* doctrine is used to allow the court to effectuate the testator’s intentions, and cannot be used if their intentions are thwarted.
      * Georgia Courts concluded that the Senator’s intention wasn’t to create a park, but rather to create a *segregated* park – thus the court has no alternative, but to return the park to his heirs.
  + Because there is a private party on the other side, this does not constitute “state action”; there is no indication that any judges or people within the state are motivated by racial animus.
* **Other Opinions:** *Brennan Dissent –* This is discriminatory state action that should be prohibited under the 14th Amendment
  + But for the state’s intervention, this would have been allowed.
  + State intervened continuously to beautify and maintain the park.
* **Notes:** This adopts the narrower Disparate treatment view of the 14th Amendment.

***Johnson v. Whiton* (Mass. 1893) – p.781** – rule against creation of new estates

* **Facts:** Royal Whiton conveys her property to “my granddaughter Sarah A. Whiton and her heirs on her father’s side . . .”
* **Question:** Whether the conveyance established that Sarah Whiton has a fee simple absolute interest in Royal Whiton’s conveyance.
* **Rule of Law:** Because the words of limitation divert from an existing estate type, the conveyance is impermissible under Mass. Law; it reverts to a fee simple absolute interest.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + This does not convey an established estate type, and therefore is impermissible.
  + Courts will refuse to recognize a new interest – it will interpret conveyances to try to fit them into existing forms
    - **Policy**: facilitates efficiency, protects settled expectations. Courts are also concerned about limits on alienability

**Identifying Leaseholds & Regulating Rent Conflicts**

Types of Tenancies:

1. Term of years
2. Periodic tenancy, e.g. month to month
3. Tenancy at will
4. Tenancy at sufferance/holdover tenant

Regulations around landlord-tenant relationships:

* Originally governed by common law
* Has become heavily regulated by state and federal government

***Vasquez v. Glassboro* (N.J. 1980) – p.818** – defining and regulating landlord-tenant relationships

**Facts:**

* Defendant farm labor service challenged the trial court's decision in favor of plaintiff migrant farm worker in an equitable action seeking to enjoin defendant from ejecting plaintiff from communal housing that defendant provided for its farm laborers. Plaintiff and other Puerto Ricans signed a contract with defendant, agreeing to harvest crops for six months in exchange for free living quarters and wages. The contract did not provide for transportation back to Puerto Rico unless plaintiff fulfilled the contract. After plaintiff was fired for poor job performance, defendant immediately ejected plaintiff from the barracks.

**Issue:**

* Can a farm labor service that employs migrant farmworkers dispossess a worker from farm housing by self-help and without an eviction action?

**Holding:**

* Even though the migrant worker is not a tenant, his eviction should be governed by the appropriate processes

**Reasoning:**

* When/why/how should property law change? Should a court be able to go beyond what a legislature has already decided (extend anti-eviction law to janitors and superintendents) and add another protection for migrant farmworkers? Court ends up creating a new right by analogizing to contract law
* Statutory protections of migrant farmworkers through the NJ Anti-Eviction Act (this is an outlier of a statute – NJ provides sweeping protections for tenants)
* If you’ve occupied a premise owned by your employer as an employee, you are not a tenant. (exceptions: superintendent, janitor) 🡪 so the landlord can evict you
* BUT such contracts are void if they are against public policy:
  + NJ Occupational Safety and Health Act – this is a key legislative concern
  + *State v. Shack*
  + “Contract is inconsistent with the enlightened attitude of the legislature and the courts towards migrant workers.”

***Sommer v. Kridel* (N.J. 1977) – p.856** – remedies for landlords; landlord duty to mitigate

* **Facts:** There are two companion cases where the tenant originally entered into the lease, but left the tenancy early, Sommer never even entered the building. In both cases the landlord left the apartment vacant, and chose not to show it to prospective tenants.
  + Landlord later brought suit against Sommer for 9 months of back-rent. Sommer counter-sued demanding return of his deposit.
* **Question:** Whether a landlord has a duty to mitigate damages as a result of a defaulting tenancy.
* **Rule of Law:** A landlord does have a duty to mitigate where there is a claim for damages under a residential lease.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + The difference between a lease and an ordinary contract in the modern area has shrunken away to nothing. Potential argument that property law is merging with contract law
  + Failing to apply the mitigation rule is unjust under the circumstances.
    - Landlord needs to make reasonable effort to re-let apartment
    - *Fairness*: You would expect the landlord to mitigate
    - *Efficiency*: There’s no reason to leave a room open if someone wants it
  + There is no standard for assessing whether the landlord has diligently pursued remediation, but the rule should approximate best efforts.
    - Tenant can proffer evidence that the landlord rejected suitable alternative tenants, for example.
* **Notes:** Duty to mitigate isn’t universal: California has a duty, but New York doesn’t.
  + Duty to mitigate has become the majority rule

**Regulating Living Standards**

Implied Warranty of Habitability: Originates in *Javins v. First Realty Corp.* (D.C. Cir. 1970). Refers to implied terms that the place you are renting will actually be habitable. Courts will read this warrant into *all* leases regardless of whether it is explicitly included. What the implied warranty of habitability requires is measured by the standards set out in local housing codes/regulations.

If the warranty is broken, tenants can break lease and leave or stay. If they stay, they do not need to pay rent for as long as repairs are needed.

***Javins v. First National Realty Corp.* (D.C. Cir. 1970) – p.874** – warranty of habitability

* **Facts:** The landlord filed suit, alleging that the tenant had failed to pay rent. The tenant alleged that they had stopped paying rent due to the over 1,500 hosing code violations, and were seeking an equitable set-off for as long as it took to repair the building.
* **Question:** Whether housing code violations which arise during the term of a lease have an effect on the tenant’s obligation to rent.
* **Rule of Law:** A warranty of habitability, measured by the Housing Regulations for the District of Columbia is implied by operation of law into the leases of urban dwelling units covered by such regulations.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + Traditionally, the landlord’s only common law duty is to provide access to the land.
    - This common law duty should be modified for today’s world: people aren’t seeking an interest in land, but rather are looking for a place to stay of reasonable quality.
      * Tenants aren’t “jacks of all trades,” and are more transient than middle ages.
    - Courts have modified the old rules to include an implied warranty on all manners of other consumer goods – there should also be one on homes.
    - Due to urban housing shortages, there is a severe imbalance between tenants and landlords.
  + Judged as a contract, the lease must be made in compliance with existing law – including the housing code.
  + Finder of fact must decide the extent of the violations
  + Counterargument:
    - Eviction proceedings “more drawn out” now that tenants can assert violation of housing code or analogous failures as defense for nonpayment, even where premises is habitable.
* **Note:** The implied warranty of habitability has become the majority rule, and is non-waivable and non-disclaimable.

***3000 B.C. v. Bowman Properties Ltd.* (Pa. Com. Pl. 2008) – p.868** – Covenant of quiet enjoyment: more expansive set of harms than covered by warranty of habitability, e.g. privacy, peace and quiet, right of use, safety and security

* **Facts:** 3000 B.C. is a spa that was forced to move because the landlord began construction, and allowed a hair cuttery to move in upstairs.
* **Question:**
  + Whether the landlord’s actions breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
  + Whether the plaintiff is entitled to damages beyond the end of the lease.
* **Rule of Law:** The plaintiff’s implied covenant of quiet enjoyment was breached. The plaintiff is entitled to damages approximating their financial position, assuming there was no initial breach.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + There is an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, the breach of which constitutes a constructive eviction.
  + Damages should approximate the respective positions of the parties, assuming that there was no constructive eviction [i.e. the tenant vacated the premises in a unreasonable time]
    - Cannot be awarded beyond the end of the lease, or assume that the lease would automatically be renewed.

**Regulating Access to Rental Properties**

**Fair Housing Act**

* Origins: History of racial discrimination; civil rights movement
* Question: How to balance rights of buyers with rights of property owners?
* Sources:
  + Fair Housing Act of 1968
  + State & City ordinances modeled after the FHA
  + Civil Rights Act of 1866

**Key Sections of the FHA:**

* “Dwelling” §3602:
  + Any building/structure or portion thereof
  + Any vacant land offered for sale/lease for construction or location thereof of any such building, structure, or portion
* Exemptions: §3603 and §3608
  + Single-family houses and owner-occupied dwellings – you cannot advertise a discriminatory sale or rental, although you can engage in a discriminatory private transaction
    - Rationale? One’s right to intimate association, right to choose; house might have personal significance to owner (cf. *Radin*)
  + Religious organizations, private clubs, reasonable number of occupants, housing for eldely persons, persons convicted of distributing/making controlled substances
* Groups NOT protected under FHA:
  + Sexual orientation
  + Marital status
  + Economic status
* Prohibited practices: §3604 and §3605

***Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommate.com, LLC* (9th Cir. 2012)** – p.1024 - statutory interpretation: definition of “dwelling”; constitutional avoidance canon of construction

* **Facts:** Roommate.com allows people seeking roommates to match with one another online. As a part of the matching process, the website inquires as to preference on sex, sexual orientation, and familial status
  + The Fair Housing Council brought a suit under the Fair Housing Act, alleging that the questions requiring sex, sexual orientation and familial status are violations of the Fair Housing Act.
* **Question:** Whether prohibitions contained in the Fair Housing Act extend to roommates.
* **Rule of Law:** Because there is a potential conflict with the 14th Amendment’s freedom of intimate association, the statute should be read in a way that avoids constitutional conflicts; thus the statute should be read as excusing roommate selection from FHA protections
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + From a textual perspective, the definition of “dwelling” was not meant to embrace individual apartments.
    - This is a weak argument, and isn’t the crux of the opinion.
  + The 14th Amendment gives us the right to enter into and choose our intimate relationships.
    - Choosing a roommate involves significant privacy issues and safety concerns.
      * Also, just want to be able to choose someone not engaging in nuisance behavior
  + Because the 14th Amendment is at stake, the Constitutional Avoidance canon should be invoked to prevent reading the statute in a way that conflicts with the constitution.
* Notes:
  + Alternative approaches to the statute:
    - Remedial action doctrine: where a statute construes possible remedial action, it should be construed broadly.
    - Housing as a human right: in selecting housing, one has a right not to be discriminated against.
  + This decision conflicts with *Belle Terre v. Boras*, where the Supreme Court finds there is no right to intimate association.

***State ex rel. Sprague v. Madison* (Wisc. Ct. App. 1996) – p.1064 –** same question as Roommates, different outcome

* **Facts:** Hacklander-Ready was renting out her apartment to a sublettor and roommate, and chose Sprague, knowing that she is a lesbian. She then revoked her offer on the sole basis of her sexual orientation. Sprague filed a complaint with the Madison Equal Opportunity Commission on the grounds that it violated a city ordinance forbidding discrimination.
* **Question:** Whether discriminating against roommates on the basis of sexual orientation violates the city ordinance.
* **Rule of Law:** Because the Madison Ordinance “unambiguously prohibits any person having right of rental to refuse to rent to any person because of the person’s sexual orientation,” their behavior is illegal.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + The ordinance is unambiguous, and the discrimination is explicit.
  + The privacy-related/constitutional claims are not relevant here because the defendant is opening up her home for rent.
* **Notes:** This is the same issue as *Roommate.com*, but with a totally different outcome.

***Human Rights Comm’n v. LaBrie, Inc.* Vt. 1995) – p.1058** – state statute patterned off FHA

* **Facts:** the LaBries purchased a mobile home park, and placed an occupancy provision on the homes, specifying that no children under the age of 18 were permitted to occupy a home. When the Vermont legislature passed a law forbidding such discrimination, they changed the covenant to: “shall not be permitted to have more than two permanent occupants.”
  + The McCarthys purchased a mobile home, then they got pregnant, and were served with an eviction notice. They later found it difficult to sell their mobile home unit because of the restrictions on it.
  + The McCarthys brought a complaint with the Human Rights Commission for violations of the Vt. Fair Housing and Public Accommodations Act.
* **Question:** Whether the “two-person per lot” restriction violated the Vt. Fair Housing and Public Accommodations Act by discrimination on the basis of familial status.
* **Rule of Law:** Because the claim was clearly based on disparate treatment on the basis of family status, and because the justification was pretextual, this constitutes a violation.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + The plaintiffs don’t need direct evidence to show disparate treatment.
    - The policy is facially neutral, but just replaces an older discriminatory policy.
    - Effect is clear: no minor children have moved onto the premises since
  + The trial court rejected the Labries’ defense, on the grounds that it was pretextual (occupancy limits based on sewage/water concerns) and could have been accomplished through less restrictive means.

**CANONS OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION**

* Plain meaning rule (*O’Brien*)
* Absurdity avoidance (*Sprague, Roommates*)
* Remedial statutes (*Roommates*)
* Constitutional avoidance (*Roommates*)
* *Ejusdem generis* – “of the same kind” (*Vasquez*)
* Later vs. earlier statutes (Civil Rights Acts)
* Inclusion of one thing is exclusion of another
* Rule against interpretation that renders a section of the regulatory scheme a nullity (*Johnson v. Paynesville*)

**UNIT 4: THE PRIVILEGE TO USE**

Property rights are not absolute – they are regulated in different ways. How do we weigh different, conflicting interests?

**Nuisance: Allocating the Entitlement**

What happens when your right to use your own property interferes with someone else’s right to use and enjoy their property?

Law of nuisance: substantial and unreasonable

* Which party has the basic entitlement?
* Who got there first?
* Who can best avoid the harm?
* What is the character of the land?
* Definition: A substantial or unreasonable interference with the use of land.
  + Typically involve activities that are “offensive physically, to the senses and which by such offensiveness makes life uncomfortable such as noise, odor, smoke, dust, or even flies.
  + Difference with trespass: trespass protects right of exclusive possession – NO showing of actual harm is required. Merely must show an unauthorized entry.
    - Nuisance protects right of use and enjoyment – you DO have to show substantial and unreasonable harm.

**Proving Nuisance:**

1. Is the interest encompassed within right to use and enjoy?

2. Is the interference substantial? Consider: extent of the harm; plaintiff’s ordinary sensibilities

3. Is the harm unreasonable?

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Three Prong Test: | Is the harm **Unreasonable?**   * + - * *The Court must consider the following factors:* | Considerations in the five-factor Unreasonableness Test |
| 1. Which interests constitute the **use & enjoyment of land**? 2. Is the activity causing **substantial harm**? 3. Is the harm **unreasonable**? | 1. Extent of the Harm 2. Character of the Harm 3. Economic and social value of the conflicting activities. 4. Suitability of an activity for the location. 5. Ability of either party to avoid the conflict and the practicality of making them do so. | * **Fairness**   + Character of the harm   + Distributive justice   + Fault * **Welfare**   + Costs and benefits   + Incentives   + Cheapest cost avoider |

***Johnson v. Paynesville Farmers Union Cooperative Oil Co.* (Minn. 2012)** – p.363 – trespass v. nuisance; causation/proximate cause required for nuisance claim

* **Facts:** Paynesville Farmers Union Cooperative Oil Co. sprayed pesticide that drifted towards and contaminated the crops on Johnson’s Organic farm. As a consequence of the drift, the Johnsons could not sell their crops as a premium “organic” price for three years, according to the National Organic Program.
  + The Johnson brought an action against Paynesville for trespass and nuisance.
* **Question:** Whether chemical drift onto one’s property constitutes either trespass or nuisance.
* **Rule of Law:** There is no cause of action for trespass because there was no physical entry on the land, and there is no cause of action for nuisance because the plaintiff alleged no substantial harm.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + No trespass
    - Trespass requires intentional or tangible entry onto another’s land.
      * There was no physical entry here
      * Court doesn’t want to require a showing of harm for trespass, as this would erode the right to exclude
        + Opens door for a whole host of liability for invasion of property by intangible property if you don’t have a requirement of harm
    - Washington and Alabama have allowed a trespass cause of action for chemical drift, but this conflicts with existing Minnesota law, and conflates trespass and nuisance law.
  + **No nuisance cause of action**
    - The Johnsons seek a nuisance finding because 7 C.F.R. §205.202(b) forbid them from selling their crops as organic crops.
      * Ct. believes that the Johnsons are misreading the statute: the proper interpretation is that they are forbidden from *intentionally* applying pesticides.
      * For this reason, they did not properly allege a **substantial harm** resulting from the application of pesticides.
      * Court also does not find *causation* between the conduct and the harm

***Dobbs v. Wiggins* (Ill. App. 2010) – p.340** – establishing substantial and unreasonable harm

* **Facts:** The Wiggins family has lived on their property for 15 years, and has been raising dogs there. Currently there are over 70 dogs, which bark all day and all night at a volume audible over two miles away.
  + The Dobbs, who have lived on their property for over two years now bring suit for nuisance, alleging that the noise is too great.
* **Question:** Whether the Wiggins dogs’ barking constitutes a nuisance.
* **Rule of Law:** Because this was a substantial and unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the Dobbs’ land, this constitutes a nuisance.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + The three elements are all satisfied to show that this is a nuisance.
    - The harm was **substantial**: the plaintiffs weren’t especially sensitive to noise, and the trial court found as a matter of fact that it was enough to constitute a substantial harm.
    - The noise made by the dogs was **unreasonable**: plaintiffs were there first, the noise can’t be reduced or stopped, and the defendant has made efforts to lower the volume unsuccessfully.
    - The noise was sufficient to interfere with the **use and enjoyment of the land**.
  + Case is remanded to determine the appropriate equitable remedy. Unclear whether forcing Wiggins to reduce number of dogs to 6 makes sense – is there a less restrictive solution?

**Nuisance: Choice of Remedy**

**Reciprocal costs:** core to theory of law and economics. What happens when two similarly useful uses of land come into contact with one another?

**Economic Analysis of Nuisance**

* Entitlements: rights that are enforced by the states, e.g. right to be secure from harm, right to engage in factory use
* How should a court decide who gest the entitlement?
  + Economic analysis: identify the most efficient rule of law
    - Kaldor-Hicks efficiency: benefits > costs, even if someone is worse off
* Classical Approach: Force Internalization of Externalities
  + *Externalities:* costs imposed on third parties that are not accounted for in the actor’s cost-benefit decision.
  + Classical approach forces factories to pay for the costs they impose on others so that it integrates into their own cost-benefit analysis.
  + Clears up the accounting – maintains benefits of factory operation while forcing factory to axcount for harms to society (e.g. pay damages)
* Coase Theorem: Efficiency Analysis / critique of classical economics
  + *Joint Costs*
    - When one party is causing harm to the other, any shifting in responsibilities/ equilibrium would cause harm to the other
    - The problem isn’t about causing harm, but **how to distribute shared costs**.
    - Which land use maximizes social welfare? (NOT at internalizing externalities)
  + *Allocation of Legal Entitlements*
    - The Court’s goal is to distribute entitlements to those who value them most under the circumstances.
      * Regardless of how the court rules, the parties will always engage in *ex post* bargaining for the most efficient allocation.
      * Assuming that there are no transaction costs, it doesn’t matter how entitlements are distributed: **the outcome will always be the same, with the parties reaching equilibrium**.
      * Court is giving parties a starting point for negotiation: whoever values the entitlement more will keep it or buy it from the other party – IF the transaction costs are zero
  + *Accounting for Transaction Costs*
    - Because there are transaction costs, the courts can reach the most efficient outcome by **awarding an entitlement to the party that would purchase the entitlement absent any transaction costs**.
      * Transaction costs: free rider problem; holdout problem; strategic bargaining costs; bilateral monopoly (when two parties negotiate, the costs can be especially high).
* Contra Coase: Behavioral Model
  + *Posner:* Relying on a willingness to pay disadvantages the poor – we should weigh their interests more highly when we model this.
  + *Endowment Effect:* Humans are inherently risk-averse, and value freedom from loss more than prospective gain.
    - Once a court initially distributes entitlements, they calcify, and become sticky such that parties are unwilling to surrender the initial distribution.
  + *Offer-Ask Gap:* there is often a huge gulf between what homeowners can offer a factory, and what the factory requires to cease operation.
  + *Commodification*: physical property (especially homes) have significant value beyond the financial value to homeowners, which may increase the offer-ask spread, exacerbating the holdout problem, and making transaction costs untenable.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Remedies** | **Plaintiff’s Entitlement** | **Defendant’s Entitlement** |
| *Property Rule* | Plaintiff can get an injunction ordering the defendant to stop the conduct; defendant can purchase an agreement to end injunction.  **Injunction//purchased use right** | Defendant has legal liberty to commit harm without liability; plaintiff must purchase an injunction.  **Purchased injunction//No liability (absolute right)** |
| *Liability Rule* | Plaintiff can get damages from defendant to end harms, but no injunction; defendant can commit harm if they are willing to pay.  **Damages only.** | Plaintiff can cease harm if they are willing to pay damages determined by the court in order to compensate defendant for loss.  **Purchased Injunction** |

Remedies to Nuisance

* Calabresi & Melamed, *Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Inalienability: One View of the Cathedral* (p.357)
  + Low transaction costs? Property rules (injunction) should be used – parties will negotiate
  + High transaction costs? Liability rules (damages) should be used – court should approximate damages

***Fontainebleau Hotel Corp. v. Forty-Five Twenty-Five, Inc.* (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1959) – p.370** – rights of access to light and air

* **Facts:** Fontainebleau and Eden Roc Hotels are adjacent to one another on the Miami beachfront. Fontainebleau is building a 14-floor addition to its hotel that would block the sunlight from the Eden Roc’s cabana, swimming pool and sunbathing area.
* **Question:** Whether a landowner has a legal right to light or air from their neighbor’s adjoining property.
* **Rule of Law:** Because there is no legal right to light or air flowing from an adjoining property, there is no legally-recognized harm.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + A property-owner need not use their land in a way that does not infringe on the rights of adjoining landowners
    - There is no right to light or air that comes through an adjoining property.
* **Notes:**
  + Most states do not recognize a right to light or air.
  + Exceptions to this rule:
    - *Spite Fences:* structures erected for the sole purpose of interfering with their neighbor’s light
    - *New Hampshire rule:* light and air should be recognized as permissible sources of damages so that nuisance law can be flexible enough to respond to future demands should they arise.

***Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.* (1970) – p.358** – permanent injunction for a nuisance

* **Facts:** Atlantic operates a cement factory, which damages the neighboring homes due to dirt, smoke and vibrations. The court has already found that it constitutes a nuisance.
* **Question:** Whether the court should award damages, or an equitable remedy to the plaintiffs.
* **Rule of Law:** In order to compensate the plaintiffs, while still dealing fairly with the defendant, the court grants damages to the plaintiff. They will grant an injunction on the defendant until the defendant pays.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + The traditional rule is to provide an injunction, but that would permanently shutter a cement factory that employs a large number of people.
    - Delayed injunction would have the same effect: it would force the defendant to either move or else find a less disruptive alternative, which doesn’t presently exist.
  + Risk of damages is enough to spur research into prevention of the original harm, and act as a deterrent.
* **Notes:**
  + Pivots from the traditional property rule to a liability rule.
  + Indicative of the Progressive-era approach towards forcing nuisance
  + Court may order permanent injunction even when losses suffered by plaintiffs are much smaller than the “benefits” that the defendant generates

**SERVITUDES**

Servitude – a right or obligation that “runs with the land” – distinct from a contract

* Affirmative servitude = easement = nonpossessory right in land
* Negative servitude = covenant = restrictions on what owners can do with their own land

Burdened estate = land with easement or covenant running through

Dominant/benefited estate = land that’s benefiting from the servitude

Appurtenant easement = cannot be separated from the land

Easement in gross = tied to a specific individual

**FRAMEWORK:**

Servitudes

Covenant or Easement?

If Easement: Express or Implied?

If Implied: Estoppel, Prescriptive, Prior Use, or Necessity?

Can be in gross or appurtenant

**Express Easements**

**Procedural requirements for creation of express easements:**

1. Writing
2. Notice – actual, inquiry, or constructive
   1. Actual Notice: The owners of the servient estate knew about the easement
   2. Inquiry Notice: If there are visible signs of use by a non-owner, and a reasonable buyer would discover the easement with a proper inquiry.
   3. Constructive Notice: Whether or not the owners knew, they should have known.
      1. If it is written into the deed, it is considered to be constructive notice.
3. Intent

***Green v. Lupo* (Wash. Ct. App. 1982) – p.520** – interpretation of ambiguous easements 🡪 grantor intent

* **Facts:** The Greens sold land to the Lupos using an installment contract (deed does not transfer until the last payment). Lupos request a deed release on the condition that they grant an easement between their two respective properties for a driveway.
  + The Greens then construct a mobile home park on their half of the property. Residents use the easement as a runway for loud motorcycles. The Lupos block the easement, refusing to allow them to pass
* **Question:** Whether the easement between their property was appurtenant or an in gross easement granted specifically to the Greens.
* **Rule of Law:** Because the language is ambiguous, and there is a strong presumption of appurtenant easement, this easement is appurtenant.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + The easement itself is ambiguous: while it specifically names the Greens, usually an easement for ingress is appurtenant.
    - **When the language is ambiguous, there is a strong presumption for finding an appurtenant** **easement.**
      * *Efficiency:* would force each subsequent owner to bargain for use of the easement.
      * *Fairness:* allows owners to negotiate among themselves.
  + While there is an opportunity to reach an equitable remedy, a total ban on motorcycles is unreasonable and an abuse of discretion.

***Cox v. Glenbrook Co.* (Nev. 1962) – p.524** – scope of an easement

* **Facts:** Quill negotiated an easement with the Glenbrook Company in order to access his property from the highway through Glenbrook’s estate.
  + Subsequently, Cox & Detrick acquired the Quill property and began to develop it. They then sought to pave and expand the narrow, dirt road constituting the easement over the Glenbrook estate.
* **Question:** Whether Cox can pave and expand the “Quill Easement” over Glenbrook’s land – what’s the scope of the easement? To what extent does the grantor’s original intent inform how we interpret the rights granted by the easement?
* **Rule of Law:** The right of way constitutes an appurtenant easement, which can be improved so long as it hews closely to the original intent of the grantor. You can’t extend the road past its current width.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + The easement is appurtenant because it is in writing, provided fair notice, and was intended to benefit future owners of the Quill estate.
    - It doesn’t matter that the Quill estate is being subdivided – it will benefit all future owners anyway.
  + The right of way can be repaired, so long as it “is reasonably calculated to promote the purposes for which the easement was created”
    - It cannot be expanded: Quill did not contemplate use by many people – just himself.
  + There is insufficient evidence to support the finding that the development constituted an undue burden

**Easements by Implication**

* 4 different types of Easements by Implication:
  + **Easement by Estoppel:**
    - a landowner grants the claimant **permission** to use the property,
    - and the claimant **so changes their position**
    - **in reasonable reliance** on the continuation of the permission,
      * Reliance must be reasonable, and foreseeable.
    - that it would constitute a **substantial injustice to revoke** it
    - NOTE: Easements by estoppel may, alternatively, be found in 3 different kinds of circumstances (depends on jurisdiction):
      * Noncompliance with the Statute of Frauds
      * Reasonable reliance on continuation of consent
      * Fraud or misrepresentation
    - Some courts (e.g. Michigan) reject this doctrine entirely
  + **Prescriptive Easements (see dedicated section)**
  + **Easement by Prior Use**
    - Servient and dominant estates were **once under common ownership**;
    - One parcel was **previously used for the benefit** of the other parcel in a manner that was both:
      * Apparent and
      * Continuous
    - The use is either “**reasonably necessary**” or “**convenient**” for enjoyment of the dominant estate
  + **Easement by Necessity**
    - Servient and dominant estates were **once under common ownership**;
    - At the time of severance, the dominant estate became **landlocked**.

Negative easements– limited categories:

1. Rights to lateral support of one’s buildings
2. Rights to free flow of light and air
3. Rights to water from an artificial stream

***Lobato v. Taylor* (Colo. 2002) – p.537** – easement by estoppel

* **Facts:** In the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Carlos Beaubien purchased land in Colorado, and recruited families to live on the land, with the promise that he would “grant rights of access to the common lands to settlers. Taylor purchased the land in 1960; his deed indicated that “claims of the local people by prescription or otherwise right to pasture, wood, and lumber and so-called settlement rights on the land.” Then he refused to give locals right to the land, plaintiffs sued.
* **Question:** Whether there is an easement by estoppel granted to the local people, based upon their use.
* **Rule of Law:** A court can imply an easement created by estoppel when the landowner permitted another party to use the land under circumstances in which it was reasonably foreseeable that the user would substantially change position believing that the permission would not be revoked, the user substantially changed position in reasonable reliance on that belief, and injustice can be avoided only be establishment of servitude.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + There is easement by estoppel in this case
    - **Permission:** the prior landowners (preceding Taylor) granted permission to the settlers.
    - **Changes their Position:** the Beaubein promise attracted settlers to the area, by promising them the use of the land.
    - **Reasonable Reliance:** Beaubein knew that there would be reliance – survival in the absence of the promised material would have been substantially more difficult.
    - **Substantial Injustice of revocation:** Taylor received the land, knowing about the conditional use by surrounding peoples, and disregarded it.
* **Other Opinions:**
  + *Martinez Dissenting in part –* Agrees with substantially all of the court’s findings; would extend the remedy to fishing, hunting, and recreation.
  + *Kourlis Dissenting –* Would decline to apply the principles of easement by estoppel under the circumstances because there was no misstatement or materially misleading information provided by prior ownership, which has always been the case when this doctrine has been applied.

***Granite Properties L.P. v. Manns* (Ill. 1987) – p.547 –** easement by prior use

* **Facts:** Granite owned the property originally, but sold a piece of it to Manns. The plaintiff inadvertently sold two pieces of driveway essential to access to their respective properties on either side of the defendant’s. They then sued seeking declaratory judgement that both were covered by an easement
* **Question:** Whether, in conveying a portion of the property now owned by the defendants, did the plaintiff retain an easement by implication to the land.
* **Rule of Law:** Yes, A landowner can establish an easement by implication over land he conveyed if they still own the adjacent tract and the use of the conveyed land is apparent, continuous, and permanent.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + **Common Ownership**: Not in dispute here. The plaintiff owned both original properties.
  + **Previously used for the benefit of the other parcel that was apparent and continuous:** Previously used to show to be continuous and apparent – there were constantly trucks coming to deliver goods to the supermarket
  + “**Reasonably Necessary**”: The necessity prong is lessened by the continuous and open use; nevertheless, there is a strong argument that it was reasonably necessary to use the properties so that they can actually function.

***Finn v. Williams* (Ill. 1941) – p.554 –** easement by necessity

* **Facts:** Williams conveyed land to Finn, however the only way to access the property was through Williams’ property. While there were two private roads that used to be accessible, both have now been closed.
* **Question:** Whether Finn is entitled to easement by necessity under the circumstances.
* **Rule of Law:** Yes, an easement by necessity implied with a transfer of land may go unused through subsequent transfers, but still exercised at any time by the title holder.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + **Once under common ownership**: the defendant used to own both tracts of land.
  + **Landlocked**: because all other roads into and out of the plaintiff’s property have been blocked, there is no other way to access the property except by way of the defendant’s property.
* **Notes:** Necessity must arise at the moment of severance 🡪 the fact that there was permission of ingress and egress does not negate the fact that there was necessity

**Creation of Covenants**

* Real covenants can be enforced by third parties

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Real Covenants (Damages)** | **Equitable Servitude**  **(Injunctive Relief)** | **Restatement Third** (“Covenants running with the land”) |
| 1. Writing Complying with Statute of Frauds | 1. Writing Complying with Statute of Frauds | 1. Writing Complying with Statute of Frauds |
| 2. Intent to run (presumed if appurtenant, see *Sun Oil Co. v. Trent Auto Wash* (Mich. 1967) | 2. Intent to run (presumed if appurtenant) | 2. Intent to run (presumed if appurtenant) |
| 3. Privity (modern trend is to relax, but some courts retain) including both  --a. Horizontal privity (covenant created during transfer of burdened and benefited land or parties are in lessor/lessee relationship or own mutual easements) 🡪 defeated if covenant was formed after the sale or wasn’t in deed  --b. Vertical privity; current owners obtained land by legal transfer from original covenantors  ------1) Strict: requiring the grantor does not retain any future interest in the land (so yes VP when owner sells but not when she leases)  -----2) Relaxed: VP for leases too | 3. **Notice** (actual, inquiry, or constructive) to owner of servient estate; enforcer must be intended beneficiary of the covenant | 3. **Notice (**actual, inquiry, or constructive) to owner of servient estate; enforcer is intended beneficiary. For affirmative obligations (e.g. to pay homeowners association fees/maintain lawns) burden will only run to tenant if makes more sense for tenant to perform, but benefit can be enforced by either tenant or landowner. |
| 4. Touch and concern – direct effect on use or value of land. Both burden and benefit must touch and concern some land. Benefits in gross will not run against owners of servient estates unless held by governments or nonprofits (so Developers often can’t sue to enforce a covenant in a common development)  *Neponsit* tells us this is a functional test and looks at whether there is a benefit and burden to dominant/servient estate. | 4. Touch and concern – same as for real covenants | 4. Enforceable unless “unreasonable”: covenant is not arbitrary, spiteful, capricious, does not unreasonably burden constitutional right, restrain alienation, or restrain trade, and does not otherwise violate public policy. Benefits in gross can run so long as benefit holder has “legitimate interest” in covenant and is identifiable. |

Implied Negative Reciprocal Servitudes

When a developer sells a number of parcels with evidence of intent to create a common plan or scheme of development (uniformity of covenants on all surrounding plots/plots in a subdivision), even if the developer erroneously misses some, all parcels within the plan are bound to the covenants, because covenants made to the seller benefit all parcels within the plan.

***Neponsit Prop. Owners’ Ass’n v. Emigrant Indus. Savings Bank* (1938) – p.563** – allowing the creation of homeowners’ associations

* **Facts:** Neponsit develops residential community and sells land to Deyers. Covenant attached to deed requiring annual payment to homeowner's association in exchange for promise to maintain infrastructure in subdivision. Deyer home is later foreclosed upon by Emigrant, which stops paying the fee.
  + Fee is used to maintain roads, paths, parks, beach, etc.
* **Issue:** whether the covenant will run with the land and will be enforceable against a subsequent purchaser
  + Is the fee mechanism close enough to meet the touch and concern?
  + The owner association doesn’t own the land - will they meet the vertical equity requirement?
* **Holding/Reasoning:** (court applying the test of real covenant, not equitable servitude)
  + Touch and concern (same and related land) – yes, the court examines the effect of the covenant on the legal rights which otherwise would flow from ownership of land and which are connected with the land
    - The court found that the grantee is obtaining an easement or right of common enjoyment, a benefit to the land; and the covenant is to pay for that cost; clearly affecting rights, despite the payment is for expenses incurred on another piece of land
  + Privity – yes, the association, despite lack of ownership in any property of the grantor, is essentially a medium through which the property owners enjoy their common right and can enforce the covenant.
    - Note that there is no vertical transmission; the association doesn’t own any land
  + \**Writing, intent, notice* not an issue here
* **Notes:** Neponsit decision:
  + Allowed for creation of homeowners’ associations
  + Led to the rise of common interest developments
    - Defined by state statutes: you need a declaration – a master deed that sketches out the vision for the “community”
    - Multiple dwellings joined together by servitudes – a common set of interests defined by a declaration, funded by payment of HoA dues
    - Proponents argue that this is a very efficient form of land use

**Limitations on Covenants: Reasonableness & Public Policy**

The Restatement Third – rise of the review for reasonableness:

* Gets rid of privity requirements and “touch and concern”
* Represents a shift in doctrine
* Question: is this review part of the role of the courts, or of the legislature?

### ***Nahrstedt v. Lakeside Vill. Condo. Ass’n, Inc.* (Cal. 1994) – p.607** – reasonableness review of covenants; interpretation of state statute; presumption of validity

* **Facts:** The conditions and restrictions in developers’ declaration for condo prohibited animals. Plaintiff lived with 3 cats, but argued that restriction shouldn’t be enforced because it was “unreasonable as it applied to her since cats were kept indoors and were “noiseless” and “created no nuisance.”
* **Issue:** Is the restriction at issue enforceable/ reasonable?
* **Holding:** Pet restriction is enforceable. Conditions and restrictions will be enforced unless unreasonable (“wholly arbitrary, violate fundamental public policy, or impose burdens on the use of land that outweighs any benefit”)
* **Reasoning:** Presumption of validity that restriction is reasonable unless arbitrary or against public policy.
  + Pet restriction in covenant is not arbitrary, but rationally relates to health, sanitation and noise concerns that are legit for residents of high-density condo.
  + Under the reasonable standard, enforcement of a restriction does not depend on conduct of particular condo owner, but must be uniformly enforced in development unless the owner can show that burden it imposes on affected properties so substantially outweighs benefits of restriction that should not be enforced against any owner.
  + Condos have a unique hybrid nature of property rights that account for new and innovative forms of ownership.
* **Dissent:** Substantial benefit of pet ownership and undue burden on use of property. Lauded the virtues of cats. Acknowledges that some restriction in condo development but owning pets shouldn’t be part of that compromise.
  + Argues that the restriction is unreasonable because the burden of restrictions outweighs the benefits; also is wholly arbitrary because your home is your private space
* **Notes:** Why generally a presumption of validity?
  + Discourages lawsuits by individual owners seeking exceptions
  + Best way to *protect settled expectations* – “social fabric” depends on expectations
    - Shouldn’t treat written instruments as “worthless paper”

***Neuman v. Grandview at Emerald Hills, Inc.* (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2003) – p. 620** – bylaw; similar presumption of validity as if it were a deed, First Amendment review of covenants

* **Facts:** Neuman and other members of his condo association held regular religious services in their auditorium. When it found out, the Condo Association voted to ban use as a religious space by a 70% margin. Neuman sued alleging that this was a violation of his constitutional rights, and an unreasonable restriction.
* **Question:** Whether a condominium association rule banning the holding of religious services in the auditorium of the condo constitutes a violation of Florida’s condo law.
* **Rule of Law:** Rules in a declaration of condominium are valid if reasonable and don’t violate public policy or owners’ constitutional rights.
* **Reasoning:**
  + Condo association agreements are akin to the “constitution” of the association.
    - Provided the rules within this are “reasonable,” and do not violate the resident’s legal rights or the underlying public policy, the rule is valid.
    - Unique character of condominium living which, for the good of the majority, restricts rights residents would otherwise have were they living in a private separate residence
  + In this case, the board has not unreasonably restricted the right to assembly – this is not a categorical ban on people gathering; it has just provided that there is one particular type of peaceable assembly that is not allowed.
    - Avoiding the potential divisiveness between various factions is a valid reason for restricting this right.
* **Notes:** Here, the court again shows broad deference to the statute and to the condo association’s rules and regulations.

***Davidson Brothers, Inc. v. D. Katz & Sons, Inc.*** (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1994) – p.602 – reasonableness review test with 8 factors; public policy review of covenants

* **Facts**: Davidson Brothers, a local supermarket chain in New Brunswick, NJ, sold their inner-city location to D. Katz, a rug manufacturer, and moved out to the suburbs. Before doing so, they placed a restrictive covenant on their property, forbidding it to operate as a supermarket for 40 years.
  + The city later acquired the space from D. Katz, and leased it to C-Town, a discount grocery store.
* **Question:** Whether Davidson Brothers can enforce their restrictive covenant against use as a grocery store.
* **Rule of Law:** No, the covenant was contrary to public policy, and did not meet the reasonableness test, so it should not now be enforceable. [Still in the world of real covenants, but court determines that “rigid adherence” to the requirements is no longer warranted.]
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + New Jersey replaced the touch and concern test with an 8-factor analysis, of which this violates three:
    - Unreasonably long: restraint for 40 years is unreasonable.
    - Restraint of trade: this is simply rent-seeking behavior, meant to handicap competitors at the public’s expense.
    - Contrary to public policy: the inner-city area of New Brunswick is subject to serious and ongoing redevelopment efforts; this handicaps that.
      * There are no grocery stores within walking distance for a poor and immobile population segment.
      * Adverse impact on the city’s health
      * Sources: congressional committee report; expert testimony; demographic report (in the absence of a statute, this is evidence of state intervention)
    - Legislature will not enforce such a covenant that runs contrary to the established public policy.

**Limitations on Covenants: 14th Amendment & Restraints on Alienation**

How to challenge a covenant?

1. Traditional test (real covenant) – challenge “touch and concern” and other requirements
2. Equitable servitude test – lower threshold than real covenant
3. Rule against the creation of new estates – e.g. fee simple shouldn’t have conditions attached
4. Rule against unreasonable restraints on alienation
   1. *Northwest Real Estate v. Serio* – a covenant allowing a grantor to have control over whether a property can be sold is incompatible with the freedom of alienation
   2. *Woodside Village Condo Association v. Jahren* – prohibitions on leases of 9 months or more in a condo building are not unreasonable restraints on alienation; such partial restraints on alienation are ok, especially in a condo association, where you balance community goals with the individual freedom of alienation
      1. Presumption of validity also applies to restriction in a condo association’s declaration
5. Constitution / Federal statutes and law
   1. *Shelley v. Kraemer* – state court enforcement of a racially restrictive covenant constitutes state action that violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment

State action revisited: from *Shelley* to *Evans* (Fourteenth Amendment) – 3 theories:

1. State prevented “willing parties” from engaging in a transaction; “but for” state action
2. State offered its “full enforcement power” to support private discrimination – accumulation of support
3. State provided a judicial forum for parties to enforce a state law; any action is state action

After *Evans*, state action theory has narrowed significantly. Unclear if any of the above 3 theories applies

***Northwest Real Estate Co. v. Serio* (Md. 1929) – p.638** – rule against unreasonable restraints on alienation

* **Facts:** Northwest Real Estate developed a residential neighborhood in Baltimore. In each deed they placed a covenant requiring that they receive the consent of Northwest Real Estate before they sell to any third party.
  + Serio sought to purchase a home, but Northwest withheld its consent.
* **Question:** Whether the restraint on alienation sought to be imposed is void as repugnant to the granted estate
* **Rule of Law:** This policy is void as against the normal alienability of land.
  + Allowing the grantor to have control over whether a property is sold or not is incompatible with the freedom of alienation.
* **Other Opinions:** *Bond Dissenting –* This rule thwarts the property owner’s ability to protect expectation interest in value of the land. Grantor was racist: “protect from invasion into the new neighborhood.”

***Shelley v. Kraemer* (1948) – p.626** – constitutional limitations on covenants

* **Facts:** Majority of property owners on both sides of a street signed a racially restrictive covenant. Shelley (a black man) bought one of the parcels in question. Respondents, who are owners of other property subject to the terms of the restrictive covenant, brought suit to restrain Shelley from taking possession of the property.
* **Rule:** State Action Doctrine - State court enforcement of a racially restrictive covenant constitutes state action that violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
* **Holding:** By enforcing such restrictive covenants, states have acted to deny petitioners the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.
* **Reasoning:** Court enforcement would have the government, through its judicial branch, facilitating discrimination.

***Woodside Village Condo Ass’n, Inc. v. Jahren* (Fla. 2002) – p.640** – partial restraints on alienation

* **Facts:** Noticing that many of the condo units were being leased to non-owners, the Condo Association Board amended its constitution to prohibit leases to third parties lasting more than nine months, and forbidding leasing within the first twelve months of ownership.
  + Jahren sued, on the grounds that this was an unreasonable restrain on alienation.
* **Question:** Whether the Condo Association’s amendment prohibiting leases of 9 months or more is an unreasonable restriction on alienation.
* **Rule of Law:** Because Jahren opted into this democratic form of property ownership, he is bound to the amendments. Provided amendments are reasonable, they can be accepted.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + Here, we’re weighing community goals with the individual freedom of alienation
  + Restriction contained in a Condo Association’s Declaration is clothed with a “very strong presumption of validity.”
    - Condo Association is democratic – the owners opt into the ownership form, and choose willingly to abide by its rules.
    - Provided for completely by statute.
  + Provided that the amendment is reasonable, it is allowed.

**ZONING: Regulating the Power to Use through Zoning Law**

**Origins, Authority, Process, & Constitutional Limits**

***Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.* (1926) – p.424** – zoning as valid use of state police power; Euclid deference

* **Facts:** The Village of Euclid imposed a zoning map, restricting use of certain pieces of property. Plaintiff’s property use was restricted in party to only single and two-family dwellings; in other parts it was restricted to also include certain types of commercial uses.
  + Plaintiff sued, alleging that this was a breach of his 14th Amendment Rights.
* **Question:** Whether imposing zoning laws constitute a violation of due process rights.
* **Rule of Law:** Zoning laws are sustainable as a valid use of the state’s police power, provided there is a rational basis (health, safety, morals or general welfare) for such regulation. If validity of the legislative classification for zoning purposes is fairly debatable, the legislative judgment must be allowed to control. Provisions must be clearly arbitrary and unreasonable to be unconstitutional, with no substantial relationship to public welfare
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + Euclid deference – if validity of the legislative classification for zoning purposes is fairly debatable, the legislative judgment must be allowed to control
  + The police power can be used to stop nuisance – no serious debate that is an invalid use of the police power.
    - Zoning is arguably necessary to improve the health, safety, morals or general welfare.
      * Apartments can block the sun, be an eyesore, and depress value of surrounding properties.
* **Notes**: This deference opens the door for covenants and “neutral” zoning policies that are concerned with racial segregation, even though using zoning to directly regulate is illegal (*Buchanan v. Warley* – struck down a Louisville Kentucky statute that prohibited both white and black people from moving into and occupying a residence on a street that included a majority of owners of the opposite race).

***Belle Terre v. Boraas* (1974) – p.1132 –** “rational relationship” between ordinance and the state’s objective; ordinance does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment; rational basis review is appropriate

* **Facts**: An ordinance in Belle Terre (small town of 700 people) restricts zoning to single-family dwellings and further limits the definition of family (two people, related by blood, adoption or marriage…).
* Owners leased home to SUNY students, and village served owners with Order to Remedy Violations. Students challenge constitutionality of ordinance.
* **Issue**: Is the zoning ordinance that prohibits groups of unrelated persons from sharing a home an appropriate use of the government’s police power/ constitutional?
* **Holding**: Ordinance is constitutionally permissible
* **Reasoning**: Under Euclid deference, ordinance is not unreasonable and arbitrary. The city had a rational basis for its prohibition on housing large numbers of unrelated individuals because creating a quiet neighborhood is a permissible state goal. The legislature is the correct body to define “family,” rather than the judiciary. No fundamental right being burdened here 🡪 rational review should be applied. The ordinance did not restrict the freedom of association, as homeowners may entertain at their discretion.
* **Dissent**: Ordinance infringes a fundamental right of the First Amendment freedom of association and privacy and should be evaluated under strict scrutiny, not rational basis review.
  + Zoning officials may restrict the use of land, but may not properly restrict who the persons living on land may be, as that is protected by the due process clause (Fourteenth Amendment). Ordinance is both underinclusive and overinclusive. The court is overreaching.

***Moore v. City of East Cleveland* (1977) – p.1135** – Fourteenth Amendment rights violated by ordinance; must survive strict scrutiny

* **Facts:** a city’s zoning ordinance limited the number of unrelated people who could live together in one household and defined “unrelated” to keep Mrs. Inez Moore (the appellant) from living with her two grandsons who were first cousins.
* **Holding:** The zoning ordinance was declared unconstitutional for infringing on the rights of the extended family (namely the fundamental right to keep the family together that includes an extended family) – Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
* **Reasoning:**
  + “[When] the government intrudes on choices concerning family living arrangements, this Court must examine carefully the importance of the governmental interests advanced and the extent to which they are served by the challenged regulation . . . When thus examined, this ordinance cannot survive.”
* **Other Opinions**
  + *Brennan Concurring –* Argues that the meaning of family is different in different racial and ethnic communities. Meaning is to be determined by reference to a broader social text that consists of history and tradition and our lived experience.
  + *White Dissent* – this is a valid exercise of the police power because there is a rational basis.
  + *Stewart Dissent* – *Belle Terre* should govern here, and restrict use because there is no valid use. Argument here would be that there is a “rational relationship” between the ordinance and the city’s objectives to prevent overcrowding; Euclid deference should apply
* **Commentary:**
  + Ideology of the family, ideology of the judicial role and what it means for the court to be developing and enforcing ideas about rights that have no clear location in the text, language, or design of the constitution
  + It’s different to regulate the family itself, rather than just the household (as in *Belle Terre*)

**Challenging Zoning & Rezoning**

**Analyzing a zoning code/ordinance - FRAMEWORK**

1. Is there a rational relationship between the ordinance and the policy objectives?
   1. i.e. is this an appropriate use of state police power? (*Euclid / Belle Terre*)
2. Does the ordinance infringe upon a classification under the Fourteenth Amendment? Or a fundamental right (like First Amendment right of freedom of association)?
   1. If so, need to apply strict scrutiny of ordinance

**Notes on Prior Non-Conforming Use**

* Prior Non-Conforming Use: if a non-conforming use precedes the implementation of zoning rules, it is entitled to continue its current use, provided that there is **no substantial change** in the type of use or non-conformity.
  + *Amortization*: the city may allow prior non-conforming use, but make it time-bound and phase them out.
    - Test for proper amortization: whether the owner can obtain a reasonable return on their investment, weighing public gain against private loss.
  + Prior non-conforming uses can be transferred, but the city is also entitled to restrict such transfers by statute.

**Notes on Contract/Conditional Zoning**

* Definition: When municipalities rezone property in return for certain types of concessions.
* Source of challenges:
  + Unauthorized by a zoning enabling act
  + Inconsistent with the comprehensive plan
  + Illegal, preferential “spot zoning”
* Today, some states allow contract zoning, and others do not. [see *Durand*]

***Belleville v. Parillo’s Inc.* (N.J. 1980) – p.437 –** prior nonconforming use

* **Facts:** Parillo’s operated as a restaurant in an area zoned for residential use; this was allowed because it was a preexisting non-conforming use. The owners made renovations and attempted to reopen as a disco; the city denied the permit, but Parillo’s went forward anyway.
  + The city gave Parillo’s a volation ticket, which it disputed as a permitted use under the prior non-conforming use exception.
* **Question:** Whether the prior non-conforming use exception to zoning laws applies in the case of a change from “restaurant” to “disco.”
* **Rule of Law:** An existing nonconforming use will be permitted to continue only if it is a continuance of substantially the same kind devoted at the time of the passage of the zoning ordinance. Because this was a discontinuity in use-type, it is prohibited.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + Although non-conformity preceding the zoning code is permitted, future non-conformity must be of the same type.
    - Crowds, lines, loud music, and fewer tables elide the fact that the character of the use has substantially changed.

***Stone v. Wilton* (Iowa 1983) – p.441** – vested rights

* **Facts:** The Stones purchased a property in Wilton with the purpose of building federally-subsidized low-income housing. In selecting the site, they relied on an existing zoning map.
  + The Stones apply for a building permit, which the town of Wilton denies, and rezoned the property to a single-family use. The Stones sued on the grounds that they had a vested right to the property, and that the rezoning constituted a taking.
* **Question:** Whether the re-zoning was a taking under the **vested rights** doctrine.
* **Rule of Law:** No: in order to have vested rights in a zoning classification, the owner has to have made substantial efforts under the classification toward accomplishing the proposed project.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + There is no vested right here because there was not enough substantial action in conformity with the plan to build multifamily housing.
    - The Stones spent money securing financing, and obtaining permits, but it had not yet secured contractors, started construction or signed up tenants.
  + There is a rational basis for the taking in this case: worries about traffic and support of the electrical grid.
* **Notes:** States will have different rules re: vested rights. E.g. in WA, you get vested rights as soon as you apply for a permit! 🡪 “early vesting approach” promotes certainty because it identifies a moment in the development processes where people know the rules will remain. *Abbey Road Group v. City of Bonney Lake*
  + Some states allow vesting if a developer obtains site-specific approval for development even before a permit is issued (NJ)
  + Some states even grant developers vested rights to use their land in accordance with the zoning law in place at the time that they apply for site-specific approval (CO, MA, TX)

***Durand v. IDC Bellingham, L.L.C.* (Mass. 2003)** – p.447 – “sale” of police power

* **Facts:** IDC Bellingham owns and operates a power plant in the town. It asked for the town to rezone a part of the surrounding area, but the town rejected their request. It then offered $8 million to help the town’s budget shortfall, and to assist in the construction of a nearby school.
  + Citizens of the town brought a civil action against IDC Bellingham, alleging that the zoning was void because it was illegal “contract zoning.”
* **Question:** Whether the zoning ordinance was void because it constituted “contract zoning.”
* **Rule of Law:** An agreement including a voluntary offer of public benefits in exchange for a vote in favor of rezoning a parcel of land does not invalidate the legislative decision to rezone.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + The test is whether rezoning was arbitrary, unreasonable, and not substantially related to the public health, safety, or general welfare of the town (*Euclid*)
  + “Contract zoning” is illegal if the municipality promises to rezone a property (before a vote) in return for negotiated consideration.
    - Here, IDC made a voluntary offer to the city, which the city did not need to accept. There was no bargaining involved
    - All appropriate processes were followed
    - The court is deferential to legislative decision making 🡪 “fairly debatable”, so apply Euclid deference
  + There was a valid public purpose, so this clears the hurdle for the police power doctrine.
* **Other Opinions:** *Spina Dissenting* – the parties struck a deal: money for a zoning change. Because there were extraneous considerations, the validity of the agreement can be doubted.
  + This was a “sale of police power”

**Challenging Exclusionary Zoning**

**Regulating the State’s power to zone – sources of law:**

1. US Constitution
2. State common law doctrines and statutory procedures
3. State Constitution
4. Federal & state statutes (e.g. FHA)

**HUD: Building a Disparate Treatment claim under the FHA: [based on 2013 rule]**

1. Plaintiffs establish prima facie case of disparate treatment.
   * Impact of zoning on minorities in community
   * Sequence of events leading to zoning decision
2. Burden shifts to defendant to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions
3. Burden shifts back to plaintiffs to show intent to discriminate
   * Whether defendant would have taken same action solely based on alleged legitimate reasons
   * Whether racial animus was a motivating factor

**HUD: Building a Disparate Impact claim under the FHA: [based on 2013 rule]**

1. Plaintiffs establish prima facie case of disparate impact
   1. Adverse impact on protected group, or
   2. Zoning ordinance perpetuates segregation
2. Burden shifts to defendant to prove that actions furthered legitimate bona fide government interest and that no alternative would serve that interest with less discriminatory effect
3. Plaintiffs need to prove that there’s an available alternative practice that has less disparate impact

***NAACP v. Mount Laurel* (N.J. 1975) – p.463 –** Mount Laurel doctrine; NJ state law ONLY

* (Minority Rule – “inclusionary” zoning/town must provide lower income housing options – responsibility to surrounding communities)
* **Facts:** Town’s land use regulation creates large industrial zone (mostly unused), for large residential zones, and one small retail zone. Residential zones include restrictions to protect home values, making property unaffordable for any but relatively wealthy residents.
  + Town’s rationale for regulation is taxes – low density housing with fewer children means good ratables – use that generates taxes with less demand for services.
  + Lower property density leads to higher property values – same reasoning as Sutherland in *Euclid*.
* **Issue:** Whether community may, by a system of land use regulation, make it physically and economically impossible to provide low and moderate income housing in the municipality for the various categories of persons who need and want it and thereby exclude such people from living within its confines.
* **Holding:** **Under NJ Constitution -** General welfare not promoted by excluding class of people – not permissible use of police power. Developing municipalities have both an affirmative and negative obligation to provide the reasonable opportunity for housing for all categories of people who may want to live there.
  + Obligations must be met unless municipality can meet burden of establishing valid superseding reasons
  + **“Land use regulation is encompassed within the state’s police power. It is required that, affirmatively, a zoning regulation, like any police power enactment, must promote public health, safety, morals, or the general welfare.”**
  + **Prima facie** case established. Township’s justification – fiscal concerns/good ratables – not sufficient. If this justification were deemed permissible, no town would provide housing essential for lower income people.
  + Shelter is among most basic human needs. Adequate housing for all is essential in promotion of general welfare. Town can’t deny housing options to lower income people primarily for local fiscal reasons.
* **Aftermath:** Created constitutional mandate for inclusionary zoning. *Mount Laurel II* extends Mount Laurel doctrine to cover all municipalities and authorizes affirmative remedies to encourage low-moderate income housing, with regional trial judges to handle cases. Courts empowered to order affirmative remedies, including government subsidies and incentives for private developers – builders remedies also created, ordering municipalities to allow developer to construct projects with low-income housing unless environmental or other concerns. Legislature responded by creating state FHA. Also allowed municipalities to pay neighboring communities to fulfill their inclusionary zoning obligations.

***MHANY Management v. Cty. of Nassau* (2d Cir. 2016) – p.1041** – building a disparate treatment and disparate impact claim re: zoning

* **Facts:** Garden City is an overwhelmingly white suburb in Nassau County, and the site of the Social Services building. Nassau County originally planned to sell its former to a private developer of multifamily housing, but many residents objected, so the city council jammed a downzoning through, such that it could be developed for single-family or townhomes.
  + Even though it would yield substantially less money for the county, it had the effect of preserving the racial makeup of the community.
* **Question:** Whether Garden City’s choice to change the zoning laws violated the disparate impact prong of the Fair Housing Act.
* **Rule of Law:** Because the District Court applied the incorrect standard for determining disparate impact, the case should be remanded for further consideration.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + The District Court applied the traditional burden-shifting analysis used in the Second Circuit.
  + However, since then, HUD has adopted the regulations enumerated in 24 C.F.R. §100.500, explaining a new burden-shifting regime.
    - Under *Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, Inc.*, the Second Circuit should defer to HUD’s analysis.
  + Evidence is incomplete based upon the HUD standard.
    - Plaintiffs “more than established a prima facie case.”
    - Defendant identified legitimate government interest going the opposite way: traffic and strain on public schools.
    - The case is remanded to determine of the Plaintiffs had offered enough evidence to overcome the Defense’s legitimate justifications.
* **Notes:** New rule from HUD as of June 2018; could do away with disparate impact claims altogether

**UNIT 5: IMMUNITY FROM LOSS – TAKINGS DOCTRINE**

**Eminent Domain**

**Eminent domain** – takings are rooted in the Fifth Amendment: **“**nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.”

1. Private property
2. Public use
3. Just compensation

**When may the government exercise its eminent domain power to acquire private property?**

Public use – what is a “public use”?

1. Public use = public purpose (*Kelo* majority)
2. Public use = truly public purpose (Kennedy)
3. Public use = prevention/elimination of social harm (O’Connor)
   1. Defining harm: *Midkiff* = land oligopoly; *Berman* = “blight” (no set definition)
4. Public use = public ownership or access (Thomas)
5. Public use = public necessity + public oversight + independent public significance (MI – *Wayne County v. Hathcock* – economic development was not a sufficient purpose to justify the condemnation of private lands for transfer to another private owner)

Just Compensation

* Eminent domain requires being compensated the “fair market value” of a property in a taking.
  + Fair market value will always undercompensate the owner because they are not willing sellers at the market price.
    - This also does not compensate owners for the costs associated with moving or other types of hardship.
  + Fair market value as compensation for a failure of the political process
  + Also cheaper to determine the fair market value instead of the owner’s subjective valuation.
  + Some states have statutory compensation schemes mandating compensation at 125% or 150% of the market value.

***Kelo v. City of New London* (2005) – p.1150** – defining “public use”

* **Facts:** The city of New London had been designated by the State as a “distressed municipality.” To increase taxes and revitalize, the city Council approved a development plan that would allow the New London Development Corporation to create a private development.
  + The development would contain new homes, private commercial development, a hotel, and an office park
  + The City authorized the Development Corporation to use eminent domain in support of its development efforts. Kelo and 15 other property-owners refused to sell, and alleged that eminent domain was improper under the circumstances.
* **Question:** Whether a private development undertaken by a private developer could permissibly be called a “public use” within the meaning of the Takings Clause of the 5th Amendment
* **Rule of Law:** “Because the plan unquestionably serves a public purpose, the takings challenged here satisfy the public use requirement of the Fifth Amendment.”
* **Stevens’s Legal Reasoning/majority [public purpose]**
  + The Court has a longstanding tradition of deferring to the legislature on questions of the “public interest”
    - *Berman v. Parker*: Court upheld a taking as a part of a redevelopment plan targeting a blighted area of Washington DC. Even though the owner’s department store itself was not blighted, the legislature determined it was a public use.
    - *Hawai’i Housing Auth. v. Midkiff*: deferred to the state’s determination that concentrated ownership could be redressed by a taking.
    - *Ruckleshaus v*. *Monsanto Co.*: could allow other chemical companies to access trade secrets submitted to the Government so long as there is just compensation.
    - Legislature here shows blight – that’s enough to uphold the decision here.
  + There is no bright line rule against development – the legislature has decided that the public will benefit. Even if private developers get money, public still can be served. Institutional competency argument – should defer to the legislature
  + No assurance necessary that public benefits will actually accrue – would break from the Court’s traditional Jurisprudence and grind development to a halt.
* **Kennedy’s Concurring Opinion [Public purpose + heightened review re: favoritism]**
  + Agrees that the legislature should receive substantial deference in the form of a rational basis review.
  + BUT there should be a review of the record by the court to determine whether there was any signs of favoritism toward the private party involved.
    - Not the case here: it wasn’t even known that Pfizer was the private party involved before the takings commenced.
* **O’Connor’s Dissenting Opinion [elimination of a harm]**
  + Economic development takings are unconstitutional because it is not intervening to eliminate a harm.
    - *Berman* and *Midkiff* are both distinguishable in that the government was intervening to eliminate a harm of an extraordinary nature.
    - New London doesn’t allege that Kelo’s house was a blight – nothing in the majority’s opinion could stop taking from one private landowner, and giving to the other.
      * This will inevitably favor the rich.
* **Thomas’s Dissenting Opinion [actual use by the public]**
  + The most natural reading of the Takings Clause is to construe “public use” as allowing the government to take property only if the government owns, or the public has legal right to use the property.
    - This is supported by a dictionary definition from the Founding Generation.
    - Early use of eminent domain was only for public use
  + The current use will inevitably disfavor the urban poor, and people of color.
* **Notes:** States have interpreted “public use” differently:
  + Justice Kennedy [public purpose + heightened review]:
    - Arizona
    - Montana
    - Pennsylvania
  + Justice O’Connor [elimination of a harm]:
    - Colorado
    - New Jersey
    - Ohio
    - Michigan (Public necessity + Public oversight + Independent public significance) – see *Hathcock*
  + Justice Thomas [actual use by the public]:
    - Washington

**Regulatory Takings**

**Regulatory takings** typically involve efforts to weight benefits and harms.

* Issue: has there been a taking?
* General rule: While property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far, it will be recognized as a taking. – Holmes, *Penn Coal v. Mahon*
  + Determining whether the harm should be compensated is dependent on 1) the relative harms imposed/the public interest, and 2) the extent of the diminution of value caused by the harm
  + Note: Court effectively repudiated result of *Mahon* in *Keystone Bituminous Coal Association v. DeBenedictis*, but the principle *Mahon* established is still settled law
  + Relevant question is whether the action forces some people alone to bear the burden of conduct that should be borne by society as a whole. *Armstrong v. United States*
* Justifications for regulatory takings:
  + Tradition: This justification forces the government to compensate outside of where the actor is engaging in a public nuisance or a noxious use.
    - This justification reinforces the traditional definition of property, which allows owners to use their property so long as it is a permissible kind of use, and forces compensation when the government needs to take otherwise.
  + Efficiency: Compensation should be required to promote welfare-maximizing takings.
    - Forcing compensation means the public internalizes the costs of takings legislation, and will only undertake it if it is worth the cost.
  + Distributive Justice: Rests on the question of whether or not the property owner, in all fairness and justice, should bear the costs
    - If an individual owner is suffering a unique burden, they should be compensated for it.

***Penn Central* 3-prong test: 🡪** apply this unless you can make an argument for per se taking; ad-hoc test for justice and fairness; takings are circumstance-dependent

1. Economic impact
2. Nature of government action
3. Interference with investment-backed expectations

Note: In *Penn Central v. New York City* specifically, the Court found that landmark designation has not interfered with rights of the parcel. This was a limited restriction on a large plot of land – could have built a smaller building on top of station

* Precedent for this decision:
  + *Hadacheck v. Sebastian* – diminution in property value alone is not enough to establish a taking (87.5% diminution in value caused by zoning law)
  + *Miller v. Schoene* – no taking when the state ordered destruction of many ornamental red cedar trees to prevent the transmission of cedar rust fatal to apple trees cultivated nearby because the apple industry was important in that states

***Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon* (1921) – p.1184** – underlying principle that if regulation goes too far, it constitutes a taking

* **Facts:** Pennsylvania Coal Co. conveyed the rights to the surface of land to Mahon in 1878, but reserved the right to mine underneath the surface for coal. Mahon brought the action to enjoin PA Coal from continuing to mine underneath their property, on the basis that the PA legislature passed a law forbidding mining in a way that causes homes to cave in.
* **Rule of Law:** Property may be regulated to a certain extent, but if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + Holmes balancing test: Determining whether the harm should be compensated is dependent on 1) the relative harms imposed/the public interest, and 2) extent of the diminution of value caused by the harm
    - This is the case of an individual losing their property – there is a limited public interest in this individual’s property – it is a private loss.
      * Also took a risk investing in the surface rights above a coal mine.
    - The coal company loses its property, which is the essence of its business interest and source of its income.
* **Other Opinions:** *Brandeis Dissenting* – This does not constitute a taking, but rather a “prohibition of noxious use”. Should adopt a bright line rule that if there is a public nuisance, then regulation should be allowed.
  + Police power’s job is to protect the public from danger
    - The public is a group – not just a collection of individual property owners.
* **Notes:** Result of this case is no longer good law, but underlying principle is alive and well

***Penn. Central Transp. Co. v. New York City* (1978) – p.1192 -** ad-hoc test for fairness and justice; *Penn Central* multi-factor test

* **Facts:** The New York Landmark Preservation Committee designated Grand Central Station a landmark. Penn Central, its owner, subsequently proposed to build a tower above Grand Central. The Preservation Committee rejected both suggestions.
  + The owners of Grand Central then moved directly to challenge the denial, claiming that the Landmark Preservation Committee had “taken” their property without just compensation.
* **Question:** Whether the application of New York City’s Landmark Preservation Law constitutes a “taking.”
* **Rule of Law:** Because the restrictions are substantially related to the promotion of the general welfare, and did not substantially interfere with the rights or uses of the property, this was not a taking under the 5th Amendment.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + *Penn Central* multi-factor test: Takings are circumstance-dependent: factors for determining a taking include 1) the economic impact of the regulation, and the way it interferes with the property; 2) the character of the government’s action; 3) interference with a distinct or reasonable investment-backed expectation.
  + Landmark designation has not interfered with the rights of the parcel.
    - This represents a limited restriction on a large plot of land (which included much of east midtown).
    - Regulations can significantly diminish the value of the land (see, e.g. *Euclid*)
    - Not like “reverse spotting” – designations are not arbitrary or discriminatory, but are based on a well-conceived public interest in preserving buildings.
      * There is reciprocity of advantage.
  + The property can still be used in the way it was intended.
    - The primary purpose of the station is to operate as a train station, which is uninterrupted by the regulation.
    - Air rights could be sold to a third party for market value.
    - Could have built a smaller building above Grand Central, which could have conceivably received the Landmark Commission’s approval.
  + There is precedent for this decision – see *Hadacheck*
* **Other Opinions:** *Rehnquist Dissenting*
  + The question instead should be whether the costs associated with landmark preservation should be imposed exclusively on owners.
    - There is no reciprocity in advantage when 1/10th of 1% of owners forfeit huge sums of money for the public benefit.
    - This isn’t preventing nuisance or noxious use of the property; but rather is prescribing the proper use.

**Per Se Takings**

A search for bright line rules: “per se takings”:

* Physical invasions – temporary/limited vs. permanent (*PruneYard / Loretto*)
* Complete deprivation of economically-viable use (*Lucas*)

***PruneYard Shopping Ctr. v. Robins* (1980) – p.1206** – Penn Central factors; temporary, limited physical occupation

* **Facts:** A group of high school students, handed out pamphlets in protest of the United Nations resolution against “Zionism.” A security guard asked them to vacate the premise.
  + The students sued that this was a violation of their free speech rights under the California Constitution, and won. The shopping center appealed, claiming that such a law constitutes a taking that should be compensated. (cf. *Lloyd v. Tanner*)
* **Question:** Whether California must compensate PruneYard for removing the ability to restrict speech on its premise.
* **Rule of Law:** Because this is a temporary physical intrusion that can be curtailed if it interferes with the property’s use, it does not constitute a taking.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + The relevant question is whether this forces some people alone to bear the burden of conduct that all should be borne by society as a whole (*Armstrong*). The answer here is no.
    - Application of *Penn Central* multi-factor test
    - Not prohibiting time, place, and means restrictions – just categorical restrictions
    - Property was opened to the public – PruneYard loses some of its ability to make categorical restrictions as a result.
  + Court distinguishes from *Kaiser Aetna* case (private marina) – in *Kaiser*, they did a ton of work to clear out the marina and relied on their expectation that they’d be able to charge club membership fees afterwards to recoup their investment
* **Other Opinions:**
  + *Marshall Concurring* – allowing compensation would freeze the common law, and hinder states’ ability to exercise the police power.
  + *Powell Concurring* – the state cannot force an owner to endorse or support speech that the owner finds repugnant.

***Kaiser Aetna v. United States*, 444 U.S. 164 (1979**) – cited in PruneYard and other cases

* **Facts:** The owner of a private piece of land invested in connecting a shallow private lagoon to the ocean, and making it a private marina accessible only to dues-paying members. The Federal Government attempted to force them to make it accessible to the public afterwards.
* **Rule of Law:** Requiring public access to the water compromised the owners’ ability to exclude, one of their most vital rights, and thus constituted a taking.
  + It also interfered with the owner’s reasonable investment-backed expectations.

***Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.* (1982) – p.1212** – per se rule: permanent physical invasion

* **Facts:** Jean Loretto purchased a rental apartment building in New York. New York state law compels landlords to allow cable television companies to install cable boxes, with only $1 compensation. the previous owner had given Teleprompter permission to install a cable television box in the apartment.
  + Loretto did not discover the cable box until she had purchased the building. She brought a lawsuit alleging that it was a taking without just compensation.
* **Question:** Whether a minor but permanent physical occupation of an owner’s property authorized by government constitutes a “taking” of property for which just compensation is due under the 5th and 14th Amendment.
* **Rule of Law:** A permanent physical occupation authorized by government is a taking without regard to the public interests it may serve.
* **Legal Reasoning:**
  + Physical intrusion of government is a property restriction of “unusually serious character.”
    - When that restriction is permanent, there is a bright-line categorical rule against doing so without compensation.
    - Physical occupation threatens to destroy existing property rights by dispossessing them of the right to exclude and the right to use.
  + Teleprompter’s intrusion was physical, and meant to last in perpetuity – that’s precisely the kind that is not supposed to happen without compensation.
  + Potential animating concern: that the government might require a landlord to devote a substantial portion of their building to, say, vending machines, with all profits to be retained by owners of those services 🡪 an example of impermissible favoritism? (see Kennedy concurrence in *Kelo*)
* **Other Opinions:** *Blackmun Dissenting*
  + The economic impact here is *di minimus* – there is no compromise of investment expectations.
  + If the owner does not want the physical occupation, they can change its use.
  + *PruneYard* represented a deeper and more pervasive invasion of the owner’s property.
  + This is no different from other statutes regulating landlord-tenant relationships (e.g. requiring landlords to provide mailboxes)

***Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council* (1992) – p.1223** – per se rule: deprivation of all economically-viable use; denominator problem

* **Facts:** Lucas purchased beach front land on Isle of the Palms with the intention of building a house on it. Then the state passed the *Beachfront Management Act*, which forbade development on certain points of erosion. The effect was to prohibit development on Lucas’ land.
  + The local court found that this was a taking without just compensation, and that the effect was to render the land “valueless.”
* **Question:** Whether a regulation that renders a piece of land valueless, constitutes a “taking” without just compensation.
* **Rule of Law:** Unless the use constitutes a nuisance at common law, any action that deprives the owner of all economically-viable use constitutes a taking.
* Legal Reasoning:
  + There is a bright-line rule: where a regulation renders a piece of land valueless, it constitutes a taking.
    - There is a heightened risk of the government making a false and pretextual claim of harm. Whether a legislature can justify a taking by citing a harm depends on whether they have a “stupid staff”
  + The “harmful or noxious use” principle does not decide this case; the proper inquiry is the “total taking inquiry” 🡪 state’s restrictions must be consistent with existing, background principles of common law of nuisance
    - Applying state nuisance law to assess the degree of harm to public, adjacent property, posed by the claimant’s proposed activities, social value of the claimant’s activities
* Other Opinions:
  + *Kennedy Concurrence* – while the court traditionally shows deference to district court holdings, it is hard to believe that beach front property would have no value.
    - Nuisance is too narrow a frame for when a taking should be allowed without compensation: courts should instead consider the impact on owners’ reasonable expectations.
  + *Blackmun Dissent* – The Court is inserting its own values in an attempt to establish a value-free takings jurisprudence.
    - There is no objective means of determining value of a property, and when it is truly deprived of “all value.”
    - In determining nuisance at common law, there is always a value-driven judgement.
      * Understandings of what constitute a nuisance that must be regulated has shifted over time – why are we grounding this analysis in a “traditional” understanding?
  + *Stevens Dissent* – The rule established by the majority is totally arbitrary. Conceivably, someone who loses 95% of their property value would not be able to recover, but someone who loses the entire value of their property would.
    - The rule also doesn’t solve the denominator problem: does a regulation prohibiting development of 5 acres constitute a 100% taking of 5 acres or 10% taking of the 50 acres (example: developer who seeks to develop 5 acres). Supreme Court has emphasized that the inquiry “must focus on the parcel as a whole” 🡪 but what does this mean?
      * *Loveladies Harbor v. US* – Federal Circuit held that courts must use a “flexible approach” to determine the appropriate denominator
      * Another possibility is the “whole property” owned by the developer
      * Or the “developable tract”
      * When air rights are at issue, a height limit does not constitute a 100% taking of air rights over that limit; the denominator is the tract as a whole
* Additional notes:
  + Only a 100% diminution in value of the property triggered the *Lucas* rule. *First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of LA*
  + *Palazzolo v. Rhode Island* (2001) – p.1237 – Acquisition of title after a regulatory law was passed did not protect the state from a takings claim. The fact that the owner took title with notice of the regulation did not, by itself, immunize the state from facing a challenge to the regulation as a taking of property – some enactments of regulations might be unreasonable, and property owners have the right to challenge what they view as unreasonable limitations on the use and value of the land
  + Destruction of real and personal property in cases of “actual necessity” need not be compensated, e.g. *Eggleston v. Pierce County* (Wash. 2003) – no taking when a home was rendered uninhabitable because of damages caused by police searching the house pursuant to search warrant. Also, seizure of evidence for a criminal trial can never be a taking (*Kam-Almaz v US*)
  + Temporary taking = owners might be able to obtain damages if they were prevented from using their property for any period. Regulatory body can choose between enforcing the regulation (compensation must be paid for the permanent taking) or rescinding the regulation (in which case the owner may have a claim for damages for a temporary taking for the period when the regulation was enforced). *First English Lutheran Church*
    - *Tahoe-Sierra*: how long must a ban be to give rise to a taking? An owner cannot isolate the slice of time over which it had the right to build as a distinctive (temporal piece of property. The parcel-as-a-whole rule prohibits this kind of conceptual severance [similar to the denominator problem for takings claims]

**Deprivation of Core Property Rights**

***Babbitt v. Youpee* (1997) – p.1251** – ILCA and whether the remedy constitutes a taking because it abrogates individuals’ right to pass on property; application of *Penn Central* multi-factor test

* **Facts:** Congress enacted the Indian Land Consolidation Act (ILCA) in 1984 to remedy the extreme fractionation of land resulting from previous land allotment policies (designed to destroy Indian culture by diving tribal land among individual owners).
  + In *Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock*, the Supreme Court upheld the allotment of land against challenges based on the Fifth Amendment.
  + Congress tries to fix the problem of fractionation, but there’s a problem with § 207 of the ILCA – we essentially have a problem of heirs’ property.
  + In *Hodel v. Irving*, the Court found that this constitutes a taking (because it’s an abrogation of the right to pass on property), since the land escheats back to tribe after the owner’s death, if there is no will (instead of to the owner’s heirs)
* **Issue**: Whether the amended § 207 of the ILCA constitutes a taking
* **Holding**: Amended § 207 is still a taking.
* **Reasoning:** Court applies *Penn Central* multi-factor test (i.e. Court declines to find a categorical taking)
  + Reviews each of the amendments made in light of each factor
  + Determinative factor is the character of the government action – it is a restriction on an important right: the right to pass on property
* **Stevens dissent:**
  + Government has a valid interest here in addressing the fractionation issue
  + Youpee had notice and opportunity to draft a will in order to pass on his property to his heirs
  + The problem is not with the constitutionality of the statute, but rather with the fact that Youpee may have lacked access to good lawyers / legal advice

**HR 40**

* Bill to establish a committee to investigate how best to proceed re: sketching out what reparations might involve; requesting $12m in funding
* Wealth in America was built on indigenous lands and through the ownership of people
* Congress/society is wrestling with how to compensate for this grave injustice. Reparations?
* Strategy of reparations through presenting a takings claim
  + Could there be a takings claim?
  + Even if so, is this the right strategy to address the injustice?

**Copyright Act of 1976 (§102, §106, §107)**

* §102. Subject matter of copyright: In general.

**HUD’s Discriminatory Effects Rule: 24 C.F.R. § 100.500 Discriminatory Effect Prohibited.**

* Liability may be established under the Fair Housing Act based on a practice's discriminatory effect, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, even if the practice was not motivated by a discriminatory intent. The practice may still be lawful if supported by a legally sufficient justification, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. The burdens of proof for establishing a violation under this subpart are set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
  + (a) Discriminatory effect. A practice has a discriminatory effect where it actually or predictably results in a disparate impact on a group of persons or creates, increases, reinforces, or perpetuates segregated housing patterns because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.
  + (b) Legally sufficient justification.
    - (1) A legally sufficient justification exists where the challenged practice:
      * (i) Is necessary to achieve one or more substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests of the respondent, with respect to claims brought under 42 U.S.C. 3612, or defendant, with respect to claims brought under 42 U.S.C. 3613 or 3614; and
      * (ii) Those interests could not be served by another practice that has a less discriminatory effect.
    - (2) A legally sufficient justification must be supported by evidence and may not be hypothetical or speculative. The burdens of proof for establishing each of the two elements of a legally sufficient justification are set forth in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section.
  + (c) Burdens of proof in discriminatory effects cases.
    - (1) The charging party, with respect to a claim brought under 42 U.S.C. 3612, or the plaintiff, with respect to a claim brought under 42 U.S.C. 3613 or 3614, has the burden of proving that a challenged practice caused or predictably will cause a discriminatory effect.
    - (2) Once the charging party or plaintiff satisfies the burden of proof set forth in paragraph (c)(1)of this section, the respondent or defendant has the burden of proving that the challenged practice is necessary to achieve one or more substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests of the respondent or defendant.
    - (3) If the respondent or defendant satisfies the burden of proof set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the charging party or plaintiff may still prevail upon proving that the substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests supporting the challenged practice could be served by another practice that has a less discriminatory effect.
  + (d) Relationship to discriminatory intent. A demonstration that a practice is supported by a legally sufficient justification, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, may not be used as a defense against a claim of intentional discrimination.
