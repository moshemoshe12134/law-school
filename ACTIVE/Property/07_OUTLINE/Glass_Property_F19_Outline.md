Unit One:

**Introduction & Justifying Property Rights**

**CASE**: *State v. Shack* (NJ 1971)

Property law – set of rules that govern relations between people over the outside world, who gets what

Defining Features of Property Law:

1. Encompasses the body of rules that govern relations between people over the external world.
2. Assigns owners a bundle of entitlements, each of which is backed by the state. These bundle of entitlements may be packaged into particular bundles, depending on the form of ownership at stake.
3. Each of these entitlements are non-absolute, governed by multiple sources of law and justified by different policy arguments.
4. In deciding how to apply these sources of law, courts will consider various factors: including expectations, fairness, and efficiency.

Justified by multiple policy goals:

1. Fairness - Equal opportunity, distributive fairness
2. Efficiency - What is a social utility?
3. Legitimacy - Consent theory
4. Administrability - If it’s easy to administer then it should be easy to enforce

Disaggregation of Entitlements: (no entitlement is absolute)

1. Privilege to Exclude - Backed by the state, can remove someone from property (core of property law)
2. Privilege to Use - Backed by the state
3. Power to Transfer Title - Can transfer possession also (tenant/landlord)
4. Immunity from Loss - If state takes property, can ask to be compensated

**Trespass**: Unprivileged **intentional** intrusion on property possessed by another

* *Walker Drug Co. v. La Sal Oil Co.* (Utah 1998): gist of an action of trespass is infringement on the right of possession
* **Intent**: Intent requirement for trespass is met if defendant engaged in a voluntary act (i.e. walking onto the property). Mistaken entry does not relieve trespasser of liability; not necessary that intent involved intent to violate owner’s legal right. But, not met if involuntarily brought onto property.

**Privileged**: A trespass is privileged and not wrongful if one of the following three are met:

1. **Consent**: entry is done with consent of owner
2. **Necessity**: entry is justified by the necessity to prevent a more serious harm to persons or property
3. **Public policy**: entry is otherwise encouraged by public policy

Legal rules may limit possessor’s right to exclude non-owners from property. Non-owners may have a right of access to the property, created by common law, federal/state public accommodations statutes, labor relations statutes, state constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech. Competing rights in different contexts, which will be explored in Trespass context.

*State v. Shack* (NJ 1971):

Importance: The right to exclude cannot be enforced in cases of necessity, property rights serve human rights/values

Rule: Ownership of real property is not absolute / Owner’s right to exclude does not override human values – individual’s right to receive government services. No possessory right of farmer-employer to prevent federally funded agents from entering their land to assist migrant farmworkers.

Facts: Tedesco owns farm in NJ and employs migrant workers who live in a camp on his property. Shack and Tejeras entered Tedesco’s property to give health services and legal information to migrants on farm. Tedesco offered to retrieve the individuals, but insisted Tedesco be present at any meeting. Shack and Tejeras declined, insisting on a right to see the men in their living quarters in private. Tedesco called a State Trooper who removed Shack and Tejeras upon receiving a written complaint.

Holding: Shack and Tejeras were allowed to enter Tedesco’s property – Tedesco does not retain a total right to exclude in all cases.

Note: “Property rights serve human values. They are recognized to that end, and are limited by it. Title to real property cannot include dominion over the destiny of persons the owner permits to come upon the premises. Their well-being must remain the paramount concern of a system of law. Indeed the needs of the occupants may be so imperative and their strength so weak, that the law will deny the occupants the power to contract away what is deemed essential to their health, welfare, or dignity.”

1. Whether trespass statute is constitutional - YES

Argument: First Amend rights of D and migrants farmworkers was offended

* Precedent: *Marsh v. Alabama* - free speech was assured by FA in a corporation-owned town open to public for Jehovah’s Witness who distributed literature on sidewalk, thus could not be held as trespasser. Analogizes migrant camp to corporation-owned town. Counterargument: Migrant camps here does not share attributes of the company town in *Marsh*, so do not come within its holding.

1. Whether D’s conduct was within the reach of trespass statute - YES

Argument: Property rights serve human values. Seasonally employed migrant farmworkers are highly disadvantaged segment of society. Congress provided assistance through sections of the Economic Opp Act of 1964, under which CLRS/SCOPE are funded. “These ends wouldn’t be gained if intended beneficiaries could be insulated from efforts to reach them… The key to that aid is communication.” Trespass prevention through property law prevents those ends.

1. Whether D invaded a possessory right of the farmer-employer - NO

Argument: Even though owner has a right to exclude, D is not invading a possessory right of the farmer here, bc of public policy concern. Farmer-employer cannot isolate migrant farmworker; can receive federal agency workers, visitors of choice, press members. “But the employer may not deny the worker his privacy or interfere with his opp to live with dignity and to enjoy associations customary among our citizens… These rights are too fundamental to be denied on the basis of an interest in real property.”

\*But court is not going to decide on a conventional category in which to place migrant farmworkers (such as tenants).

*Pierson v. Post* (NY 1805): **FAIRNESS, EFFICIENCY, SOCIAL UTILITY**

Importance: The rule of first possession, wild animals can be possessed through occupancy, court moves towards Lockian understanding of property and away from bright line because of intuitive sense of fairness.

Rule: Mere pursuit does not confer property right. Property in wild animals (ferae naturae, of a wild nature) is acquired by occupancy, meaning by taking the animal out of the commons with manifest intention by depriving them of their liberty and bringing within certain control through:

* at least mortally wounding or capturing from a distance so as to deny it any chance of escape
* at most physical possession through corporeal possession / bodily seizure.

Facts: Post was hunting with his dogs and chasing a fox in uninhabited Hamptons. Pierson saw that the fox was being hunted, killed it, and carried it off. Post brought a trespass suit against Pierson claiming he had legal possession of the fox based on a pre-possessory interest.

Holding: Pursuer Post has no legal right to pursued fox. Pierson is the rightful owner. 3 Elements:

1. Manifest intention
2. Deprive animal of its liberty
3. Bring within certain control

Dissent, Livingston: Hot pursuit is enough. Closer to **Locke**. Property in wild animals acquired when:

* the pursuer is within reach OR
* has a reasonable prospect of taking physical possession.

**Custom**: An arbitration of sportsmen could have decided this case without resort to the opinions of ancient philosophers, which are not binding on us today. Custom should be used.

Pros to custom:

* is a more reliable means because the word is so complex that the court cannot control for all possible scenarios in dif contexts
* will ensure that decision sits well with existing norms
* can be more efficient, since people can figure out applicable rule on their own

Con to custom: There may be many customs, which can cause confusion.

Arguments:

Pierson:

* + Rule: First to physically CAPTURE. Basis for title is physical possession.
  + Policy arguments: Efficiency argument and unfairness argument for rule of capture bc if someone is pursuing many animals, should not obstruct others from possession
  + Justinian’s Institutes (Constantinople, 533): “Wild animals, birds, and fish…as soon as they are caught by any one become at once the property of their captor by the law of nations; for natural reason admits the title of the first occupant to that which previously had no owner.”

Post:

* Rule: First to employ LABOR as to find and pursue. Basis for title is the finding and pursuit/labor.
* Policy arguments:
  + Efficiency argument that it’s in public good to get rid of foxes bc they are bad for farmers. Without labor as basis for title, hunters will not invest the labor needed to hunt foxes if others can intercept them just before the kill.
  + Finding for Post would have better incentivized the extermination of foxes than finding for Pierson.
* **Locke**: If you invest the labor in something, your property. The act of investing effort into property qualifies it as one’s own and removes it from nature bc you own your own labor (since you own your own body), and so the fruits of your labor are yours. “The hare that any one is hunting, is thought his who pursues her during the chase.”
* Hole: Administrability issue. Tough to know when right of possession begins, when ppl find; unanswered by rule.

*Popov v. Hayashi* (CA 2002): **FAIRNESS, PERSONHOOD**

Importance: Rule of equitable division, continuation of acquisition by first possession/capture

Rule: When a person takes a “significant but incomplete” step to achieve possession of a piece of property, and the effort is impeded by the “unlawful acts of others,” he has a pre-possessory interest in the property. This pre-possessory interest constitutes a qualified right to possession that can support a cause of action.

* If another does come into complete possession of that object, resulting from the unlawful acts of others, he has an equal and qualified right to possession

Facts: Toward the end of 2001 season, baseball player was expected to break his own home run record, and fans began to congregate in the areas where he was most likely to hit a home run. The ball (estimated worth $1 million) was property of MLB, then became abandoned property. Popov attempted to catch ball, glove made contact with ball but he never actually held it, and unclear if he would have had caught it. Popov was tackled to the ground and did not catch. Hayashi was standing nearby and was also tackled. Ended up seeing the ball and put it in his pocket.

Holding: Both Popov and Hayashi had a qualified right to the ball, and therefore must sell it and split the profits.

* Holding is narrow but it is still a good case to see how a modern court incorporates these principles

Notes:

* Public policy argument: In this case, Popov had exerted some control over the ball, but had not yet acquired possession. It is unknown if he would have acquired possession, because he was attacked by the fans seated around him. It would be inappropriate to create an incentive for such attacks to take place. Thus, in this situation, Popov is deemed to have acquired a pre-possessory interest in the ball. Because Hayashi was not involved with the mob that attacked Popov, both Popov and Hayashi have an equal, undivided interest in the ball.
* Fairness argument:
  + Baseball fans are accustomed to dominion and control establishing possession. Popov cannot prove he had dominion and control—he might have still lost the ball, even if he weren’t tackled. He established a pre-possessory interest that was impinged by the illegal actions of the mob.
  + But Hayashi did nothing wrong, was also a victim of the mob. He just happened to find the ball and take possession of it. Awarding the ball to either person would be unfair, so we will split it.
  + Court uses language of equity, fundamental fairness, even though this fairness concern is a contravention from custom.
* **Radin**: This case allows us to see theory of personhood, and also to see how courts wrestle with idea of possession, a deliberately ambiguous idea which is molded to particular circumstances.
* Applying *Pierson* to *Popov*:
  + Using Pierson to support Popov’s case would not be a good authority for us and would find in favor of Hayashi.
  + Livingston’s dissent would help Popov bc cites hot pursuit.
  + OR could look to custom of the baseball stands.

**Acquisition by Force: Acquiring Land**

**CASES**: *Johnson v. M’Intosh* (1823)

**COMPETING JUSTIFICATIONS FOR PROPERTY RIGHTS**

* First possession of occupancy - can prevent disputes about title, encouraging quick claimance of useful property
* Labor and investment
* Efficiency and maximization of social welfare
* Distributive justice - prevention of gross inequality
* Sovereign authority v. Might makes right - property rights arise from law V. are created by/in favor of those in power

*Johnson v. M’Intosh* (1823):

Importance: Discovery of land brings with it the right to obtain title either by purchase or conquest.

Rule:

* Land title transfers are only valid when made under the rule of the currently prevailing government.
* Under doctrine of discovery, the first European to see the land possesses the exclusive right of acquiring title to it over any other European (through purchase or conquest), subject only to the Indian right to occupancy.
* Under doctrine of conquest, right of occupancy gives a party exclusive title (right to conquest & purchase), but does not give that discoverer full property rights until conquest & purchase. Marshall: Right of occupancy includes right to sell. (State incentive: through monopsony, it can drive down the price to acquire the land.)

Facts: Two chains of competing title:

1. Johnson’s claim: Piankeshaw → Viviat, Murray (1775) → Johnson, Graham
2. M’Intosh’s claim: King → Virginia Company (1609) → Virginia Colony (aka the King) (1624) → State of Virginia (1776) → US (1803 and 1809) → M’Intosh (1818)

Johnson sued M’Intosh for ejectment from his lands, alleging:

* The Piankeshaws were owners of the land when they sold it to Viviat, and that the Indians’ title and power to sell should be respected;
* 1763 proclamation by the King to not buy land did not apply to the Indian tribes because they were not British subjects;
* 1763 proclamation by the King also void concerning the purchasers, because it violated the spirit of government as a system of laws;
* 1779 Act of Virginia cannot keep them from claiming these lands, because the “legislature was not competent to take away” private property

Holding:

* The titles granted to Viviat and Murray by the Illinois and Piankeshaw cannot be recognized in the courts. An absolute title held by Indians is incompatible with the Crown’s and US’ absolute title, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy - a right which Crown/US has absolute title to extinguish. Title thus cannot be recognized by US courts.
* Scope of power of Indians to give - The law which regulates relations between conqueror and conquered was incapable of application to a people under such circumstances (fierce savages, threat of massacre by Europeans, frequent and bloody wars). Indians incapable of transferring the absolute title to others, but they ceded this property to the US after American Revolutionary War , so title to Johnson amounted to nothing.
* Scope of power of individuals to receive - If an individual subject of Crown/US extinguished Indian title and used for own benefit, could still only acquire through title of gov. Grant of title derives efficacy from gov’s will. The treaty ending the American Revolutionary War transferred sovereignty and power of the lands under such transfers from the British to the United States.

Notes:

* **Marshall**, Positivism: property rights are what the law says are property rights. “Conquest gives a title which the courts of conqueror cannot deny… not for the Courts of this county to question the validity of this title.” “Uniform European understanding & settled law by tribunals of civilized states.”
* **Bentham**: Property law comes down to being a set of expectations the law gives us. If you want to understand property law, it comes down to what the sovereign/state says it is.
* **Harris**: *Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States* (SC 1955): based on rule in *Johnson v. M’Intosh*, Alaska Native tribes do not get compensation for millions of acres of land because US taking of unrecognized Indian title is not compensable under the 5th Amendment

**Acquisition by Force: Acquiring People**

**CASES**: *Dred Scott v. Sanford* (1857), *The Antelope* (Marshall, 1825), *Davis v. Evans* (Mo. 1853)

**Massachusetts Body of Liberties, Sec. 91 (1641):**

“There shall never be any bond slavery, villeinage, or captivity amongst us, unless it be lawful captives taken in just wars, and such strangers as willingly sell themselves or are sold to us.”

**Laws of Virginia, Act XII (1662):**

“Whereas, some doubts have arisen whether children got by any Englishman upon a negro woman shall be slave or free, Be it therefore enacted and declared by this present grand assembly, that all children borne in this country shall be held bond or free only according to the condition of their mother.”

* Doctrine of Partus Sequitur Ventrum: Reversed long standing common-law tradition that status of child relied on father, shifting status from relying on father to mother.

**Subsequent Acquisition: Presumption and Relativity of Title**

In the earlier cases: capture creates title to the property. Here, possession on its own creates a presumption of legal title to the property that will continue unless rebutted, even without evidence of title or of how the possession arose.

*Dred Scott v. Sanford* (1857)

Importance: People considered property are not entitled to protections/rights of Constitution. Judiciary’s role is not to judge the wisdom of this policy of Framers of Constitution, but to interpret Constitution as written. People of African descent were brought to the United States as property and were always considered as such in subsequent years.

Rule: People of African descent brought to the United States and held as slaves, as well as their descendants (either slave or free), are not considered citizens of the United States and are not entitled to the protections and rights of the Constitution (not to sue in federal court as US citizen).

Facts: Dred Scott was an enslaved person in Missouri. From 1833 to 1843, he resided in Illinois (a free state) and in the Louisiana Territory, where slavery was forbidden by the Missouri Compromise of 1820. After returning to Missouri, Scott filed suit in Missouri court for his freedom, claiming that his residence in free territory made him a free man. After losing, Scott brought a new suit in federal court.

Holding: African-Americans whose ancestors were imported into the US and sold as slaves, whether enslaved or free, could not be American citizens and therefore did not have standing to sue in federal court. Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional. Congress cannot free enslaved people who flee into the territories. Enslaved people are property under the 5th A. A law depriving slave owners of their property is unconstitutional.

Notes:

* **Positivist** argument against re-enslavement (based on *Johnson v. M’Intosh* reasoning): Courts have relied on laws and practices (law of comity). Southern slave states recognize northern states’ conferral of freedom upon slaves, so free statuts could travel back into slave state with slave who was domiciled in free state.
  + Positive sources of law: Northwest Ordinance (1781), Missouri Compromise (1820).
  + Practices in US law: longstanding tradition that state was obligated to recognize law of another.
  + **Bentham**: Should look to the sovereign; slavery only exists as a result of positive law.
* **Sanford’s** counterargument against comity, positivism application: Protects state’s property rights from being divested by another state. Johnson made similar argument: Piankeshaw have property rights that cannot be divested by a sovereign state.
* Although Framers’ language in Declaration of Independence stated that “all men are created equal,” the prevailing negative view of African Americans at the time of Declaration’s drafting meant that the Framers could not have intended those words to apply to African Americans.

*The Antelope* (**Marshall**, 1825): **POSITIVISM**

Importance: Though slavery is prohibited by the laws of most nations, can still be lawfully carried out by those nations’ subjects bc had “claimed all the sanction which could be derived from long usage and general acquiescence.”

Facts: In 1808, importation of slaves into US became illegal. In 1820, capture of African Americans for the purpose of enslaving them & importation of slaves into US was statutorily defined as “piracy.” US intercepted and overtook the Antelope cargo ship and sued for piracy.

Holding: Novelly considered the legitimacy of the international slave trade. Although the slave trade is now prohibited by the laws of most civilized nations, it may stall be lawfully carried on by the subjects of those nations who have not prohibited it by municipal acts or treaties. Slave trade is not piracy unless made so by the treaties or statutes of the nation to whom the party belongs. Possession on board of a vessel was not sufficient evidence of property.

Notes: “Given a conflict between natural law and the positive law adopted by the nations of the world, the Court held that the positive law must prevail. Slavery, then, has its origin in force; but as the world has agreed that it is a legitimate result of force, the state of things which is thus produced by general consent, cannot be pronounced unlawful.” “Whatever might be the answer of a moralist to this question, a jurist must search for its legal solution”

*Davis v. Evans* (Mo. 1853):

Importance: A master who permits his infant slave to remain with its mother during infancy, free from his control, will not be construed to have abandoned his right to possession of the child. The possession of the mother will not be adverse possession (as is protected by the statute of limitation) bc a free negro cannot hold slaves.

Facts: Woman had a child while she was enslaved. She was then emancipated. Her infant slave daughter lived with her and she claimed adverse possession.

Holding: The court did not allow adverse possession for two reasons:

* Goal is to allow children to live with their parents and granting AP will prevent that
* Freed slaves cannot own slaves

Note: **Harris**: Woman racialized in such a way that the court stated that they were acting for the good of enslaved people by not allowing adverse possession in this case.

**The Law of Finders: Relativity & Presumption of Title**

**CASES**: *Armory v. Delamarie (1722), Charrier v. Bell (1986), Wilcox v. Stroup (2006)*

Finding lost property or possessing land, even without official title to the property, will create rights against subsequent possessors, but not against the title owner. Common illustration of relativity of title. Who truly owns the property depends on who the conflict is with (original owner/possessor of the property, subsequent possessor, or owner of the land on which the property is found) and whether the property is considered lost, mislaid, abandoned.

LAW OF FINDERS:

1. Finder vs. Subsequent Possessor (*Armory*)
2. Finder vs. “Rightful” Owners (*Wilcox* & *Charrier*)
3. Finder vs. Owner of the Premises Where Property Was Found
   1. Private Property?
      1. Trespassing Finder? – Owner of the Premises Prevails (If it was lost, and the landowner was not the original owner, the finder will win)
   2. Place Open to the Public, or on Private with Owner’s Permission? – Courts are divided:
      1. Lost? – Finder Often Prevails
      2. Mislaid? – Owner of Premises Often Prevails
      3. Abandoned?
         1. The older the artifact, the more the true owner *intended* to abandon it, because she did not make an attempt to recover it (*Armory*);
         2. There are also considerations of **custom** (*Charrier)*—you put things in the garbage that you intend to abandon, you put things by a gravesite that you intend to remain there, so you have not abandoned them.

JUSTIFICATIONS

* Efficiency - reduces incentives to steal
* Fairness - lets people who were there “first” establish claim against those whom would kick them off merely bc they can. Creates equal opportunity to find items.
* Administrability - the rule allows decisions to be made even if the true owner is not identifiable

RELATIVITY OF TITLE

* Property rights are sometimes relative; they are good against some in certain circumstances, but not against others.
* When the strength of your title can vary based upon the parties claiming the property.

*Armory v. Delamirie* (KB 1722): **Finder vs. Subsequent Possessor**

Importance: Rule of Finders vs. Subsequent Possessors – Finder. Has possessory interest against all except true owner.

Rule: Finding a lost, mislaid, or abandoned object/chattel does not confer an absolute property right nor ownership, but it does give the finder a stronger claim against all subsequent claims except by that of the true owner. Subsequently may maintain trover.

Facts: Chimney sweep found a jewel, brings to goldsmith for appraisal but apprentice appropriated jewel through deceit and refused to return. Cause of action is trover (wrongful interference with personal property). Seeking return of jewel, or payment of its value.

Holding: Chimney sweep, though he does not have absolute property or ownership, has superior claim against all but the rightful owner. Even if chimney sweep loses the jewel, he still possesses it because he was the original finder. If lost it goes to finder, if mislaid goes to the owner of the property.

Note: The older the artifact, the more the true owner intended to abandon it, bc did not attempt to recover it

*Wilcox v. Stroup* (4th Cir. 2006): **Finder vs. “Rightful” Owners**

Importance: Rule of Finders vs. “Rightful” Owners – Owners. Presumption in favor of possession.

Rule: When there isn’t enough evidence to establish title to an object (aka object is of unknown provenance), presumption that whoever is in possession of the object is rightful owner, not the finder.

Facts: Wilcox found Civil War documents that were in his family for generations. The docs concerned Confederate communication and were appraised at $2.4M. Wilcox allowed South Carolina Dept of Archives and History to microfilm the docs, then he tried to sell to third party. Dept brought temporary restraining order preventing Wilcox from selling. Wilcox brought this suit for a declaratory judgment that he owned the docs.

Holding: Where neither party can establish ownership of an object, the person in possession is presumed to be the owner. In other words, possession is prima facie evidence of ownership. “Absent proof to the contrary, settled expectations will continue undistributed.” This presumption: avoids confusion, maintains the status quo, and encourages those in possession to make improvements to that which they possess. Such a presumption is used when both parties unable to establish title and when: doing so promotes stability, protects public peace against violence/disorder, and does not frustrate public interest. Prevents court from “presiding over a historical goose chase.”

Notes:

* SC’s argument: these documents are public records that are part of state archives. Evidence: Based on when family moved out, there is argument to be made that had it not been for the Union’s invasion, docs would have remained in state archives. Also, evidence of a system of archiving the docs that was in the works.
* The court determined that without the benefit of clear chain of title, evidence of original ownership, eyewitness testimony, or other useful aids in determining ownership, the court presumes ownership in favor of possession.
* In this case, neither Wilcox nor Stroup are able to present sufficient records to establish ownership of the Civil War docs by a preponderance of the evidence. As a result, the court rests on the presumption that because the documents have been in possession of Willcox’s family for 140 years, he is the rightful owner. Further, because Stroup does not have any evidence sufficient to rebut this presumption, this court concludes that Willcox is the owner of the docs.

*Charrier v. Bell* (La. 1986): **Finder vs. Landowner**

Importance: Rule of Trespassing Finder vs. Landowner – Landowner.

Rule: In the absence of a perfect chain of title, a federally recognized tribe can establish ownership over excavated burial groups when (1) The tribe claiming ownership is an accumulation of the descendants of the original owners, and (2) The original owners’ intention in interring the objects was not to abandon the good, but rather, for the burial goods to remain there perpetually.

Facts: Charrier excavated and removed 2.5 artifacts from a previously undiscovered ancient burial ground at Trudeau Plantation in Louisiana (private land) without permission of landowner. Attempted to sell the artifacts, but potential buyers were concerned that Charrier was not their true owner. Charrier filed suit against the owners of Plantation to get declaratory judgment that he was the owner of the artifacts. Trial court: Tunica-Biloxi Indians were the lawful owners of the artifacts because they were descendants of the inhabitants of the Plantation. Charrier appealed, arguing that Indians abandoned the artifacts when they moved off plantation.

Holding: When individuals bury objects with the deceased, their intentions are that those objects remain there forever, not that they become free for the taking. (Based on context → not abandonment). In such cases, intent to relinquish possession is not equivalent to intent to relinquish ownership. T-B ancestors burying artifacts with their deceased does not mean they were relinquishing ownership rights of artifacts. Thus, simply finding the artifacts of Tunica-Biloxi does not make Charrier owner; T-B own.

Note:

* Consideration of custom – you put things in the garbage that you intend to abandon, you put things by a gravesite that you intend to remain there, so you have not abandoned them
* Court also rejected Charrier’s claim of unjust enrichment. Could not show a resulting impoverishment because the majority of the excavation occurred while he had knowledge that he did not have consent to be on the land, aka was trespassing. If Charrier was trespasser, then artifacts belong to property owner.
* A thief has a superior claim under relativity of title to subsequent thieves, but a thief cannot pass on true title, and only has possessory interest.

**Acquisition By Labor & Investment: Acquiring Quasi-property Rights In News**

**(Claiming Information: Common Property)**

**CASES**: *I.N.S. v. Associated Press* (1918)

**APPLICABLE THEORIES:** Locke, Garrett Hardin, Harold Demsetz, Ellinor Ostrom, Carol Rose

Quasi-Property Right – must show:

* Expended labor, skill and money
* Sellable by plaintiff for money (valuable; court will decide what is valuable)
* Unfair appropriation (defendant has appropriated the property, and will reap its reward)
  + Policy argument: Prevent tragedy of free-rider (efficiency/welfare) and individual property’s value that they’re protecting from theft.

*I.N.S. v. Associated Press* (1918): **FAIRNESS, EFFICIENCY**

Importance: Quasi-property right acknowledged and protected in the context of a news gatherer, who cannot disseminate news gathered by another. Relativity of title, creative labor, IP.

Rule: A quasi-property right in news gathered for commercial purposes (1) only extends to news business competitors, and (2) only for limited time necessary for the company to derive profit from its labor. Otherwise constitutes unfair competition in trade bc it would violate quasi-property right.

Facts: The Associated Press (AP) and International News Service (INS) were competitors in the news gathering business. INS gathered news posted by AP on its bulletin board and furnished the news to its customers as if INS had collected. AP brought suit to enjoin. AP alleged that INS took advantage of the time dif, combined with telephonic and telegraphic technology, to sell the news as its own to its West Coast customers.

Holding: (1) AP has a quasi-property right over competitor news gatherer organizations (but not against the public) since can establish that competitor is taking material acquired by AP/pursuer:

1. as a result of organization and expenditure of pursuer labor, skill, and money;
2. is salable by the pursuer for money; and
3. defendant, in appropriating material and selling it as its own, is endeavoring to reap where it has not sown (unfair appropriation/competition)

(2) INS violated that quasi-property right bc unfairly competed. INS must delay publication to allow AP to reap rewards of its labor and derive value from publication.

Justifications:

* Fairness: deters defendant from free riding pursuer’s time/effort
* Efficiency: avoids monopolization of news distribution while ensuring news collection efforts are incentivized. Labor, investments rewarded. (**Locke**)

Dissents: Both start from positivist perspective (**Bentham**).

* Holmes: no property right, just need attribution
  + Should force INS to attribute story to AP. No property right bc whether or not the news material is valuable enough to be considered property depends on whether we protect it with legal rules (circular definition). Value is not the definition of when to protect.
  + Labor should not determine property and exclusion. Just bc product cost labor/money and has market value that others will pay - does not make product legal property.
* Brandeis: unless there is positive law, not protected
  + No property rights in the news. Once something has been made public, no right exists.
  + Once knowledge/communications have been expressed to public, pursuer loses any property right he had in the knowledge/communications.
  + Cease to be considered property, so cannot be appropriated in unfair competition in trade.
  + Should leave this to the legislature. This is an overreach.

Notes:

* While there is no continuing property right against the public in uncopyrighted news matter after it is initially published, a commercial news source does retain rights to the material against other news sources. Competitor news sources owe each other a duty to conduct their own business in a manner that will not unnecessarily or unfairly injure the business of others.
* When INS takes news gathered/published by AP on a bulletin board and sellt to its own customers without putting in the same level of time, money, production skill as AP, engages in unauthorized interference with AP’s legit business interest.
* **Ostrom**: Adjustments have to be made to free-rider problem to make it work. Don’t want to give individual reporter property rights to his labor, money, skill exerted in pursuit of stories.
* See *Pierson v. Post* dissent, Livingston: Hot pursuit is enough. Closer to Locke.

“Public Good” examples: Pierson’s fox, Associated Press news. Excludable + rivalrous = private.

1. How many people can use the good at the same time? NON-RIVALROUS?
   1. Stuffed fox = only one (rivalrous)
   2. Fact of US = infinite number (non-rivalrous)
2. How many people can be prevented from using the good? NON-EXCLUDABLE?
   1. Stuffed fox = infinite number (excludable)
   2. Fact of US = none (non-excludable)

APPLICABLE RULES OF LAW:

1. Rules for Acquiring Chattel and Real Property: Applicable?

* *Pierson v. Post* (NY 1805) – rule of first possession
  + Rule of first possession can’t really apply because “news” can’t be brought under certain control.
* *Swift v. Gifford* (Mass. 1872) & *Ghen v. Rich* (Mass. 1881) – custom
* *Elliff v. Texon Drilling Co.* (Tex. 1948) – rule of capture
  + The news is migratory like oil, so maybe INS here Is just being a free-rider. The oil was on the plot of land originally which = initial title, but there’s no comparable analogy for the news.
* *Johnson v. M’Intosh* (1823) – doctrines of discovery and conquest
  + Discovering news first. News is public good vs. incentivizing news discovery

1. Rules for Acquiring Rights in Literary Property: Applicable?

* Federal Copyright Statute
  + Copyright requires registration and that would be too time intensive, even if registration was possible federal copyright does not apply to facts
* State Common Law Copyright Regime
  + Only applies to unpublished works

**Acquisition By Innovation: Copyright**

**CASES**: *Feist v. Rural Telephone Service Company* (1991), *Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin* (11th Cir. 2001)

This area of relativity of title especially relates to **Locke** (labor/investmentasis the basis for property rights). This is especially pressing in instances of creative labor. The property is not physical, and can be shared with many people with very little additional effort.

IP LAW

* Copyrights (exclusive rights in literary and artistic works)
* Patents (exclusive rights in inventions)
* Trademarks (exclusive rights in symbols that indicate the source of goods or services; originated in state common law and supplemented by federal legislation).

**Constitution Art. I, Cl. 8. Copyright Clause**

Regarding copyrights and patents, authorizes Congress to “promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.”

* Primary objective of copyright is not to reward fruit of compiler’s labor, but to “promote the progress of…”

IP STATUTES

1. **Copyright** (17 U.S.C. : “Original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression;”
   1. Exclusive right to use or authorize the use of work for a limited time, then it becomes public domain;
   2. Usual time period is the author’s life plus 70 years, 95 years after publication, or 120 years after creation of works made for hire.
2. **Patent**: Issued to anyone who “invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter or any new and useful improvement thereof.”
   1. Generally lasts 20 years;
   2. Must be registered—U.S. Patent Office adjudicates whether new and non-obvious.
3. **Trademark**: for non-functional words, symbols, names, and devices used to identify goods and services;
   1. Does not bar uses of the mark that would not deceive customers or dilute the value of the mark (parodies and comparisons are fair game).

MODERN RULES

1. Precedential value of *INS v. AP* abrogated by *Erie*—federal courts cannot create common law where state law created the rule of decision
2. New York common law **“hot news” tort** (articulated by 2nd Cir.). 3 elements:
   1. Plaintiff generates or gathers time-sensitive information
   2. Defendant’s use of the information constitutes free-riding
   3. Free-riding reduces plaintiff’s incentive to produce product or service because defendant’s actions pose a threat “to the very existence of the product or service provided by the plaintiff”

THEORIES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Utilitarian Theory

* Addresses underproduction of creative ideas, which are public good (resources consumed non-rivalrously & which are non-excludable).
* In IP context, focuses on problem of uncompensated positive externalities produced by creative/inventive ideas. To overcome free-rider problem, must take affirmative steps to encourage public good production. But where copying is not easy or innovators can recapture the value of their investment through the market advantages of being the first mover, utilitarian argument doesn’t offer much support for IP rights. A cost of IP is that preventing freeriders from competing with innovators drives up price of consumption, and monopoly pricing usually results. IP rights have to be calibrated to balance various costs and benefits.

Locke

* Innovative ideas and creative production are products of the inventor’s intellectual labor. People should be entitled to products of their own labor.
* Scholars argue this w special force to IP since products of intellectual labor are genuinely new, so don’t detract from common resources nor leave anyone worse off. But, almost all individual creation draws on others’ work.

Radin

* Creative works are extensions of oneself. Law should extend protections accordingly.
* Through the creative process, the inventor/creator’s very identity becomes bound up with the invention/creation. This bond between creator/creation gives rise to an entitlement to control the dissemination/use of the created work.
* But, same Lockean ambiguities about intellectual borrowing apply.
* Plus, identity of others besides creator can become tied up with intellectual creation.

**Copyright Act of 1976 (Originality Requirement), 17 U.S.C. §102, 106, 107**

Regulates copyright law. Federal statute that preempts state law. Copyright protection is created automatically, with no need by author or creator to take any affirmative steps, although authors need to register their copyrights before suing for infringement.

* § 102 Protects “original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression” (including literary, musical, dramatic, graphic, pictorial, choreographic, architectural, or sculptural works) that “can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.” Grants owners exclusive rights to copy, distribute, perform, or display those works publicly and to make derivative works from them.
* Ideas and facts can’t be copyrighted; only original EXPRESSIONS of ideas can.
* Authors own what they create unless they performed “work for hire” (owned by employer).
* Copyright protection lasts for life of owner plus 70 years, after which work becomes part of public domain. Re: works for hire, copyright lasts 95 years from date of first publication or 120 years from date of creation, whichever comes first.
* § 107 Under the fair use exception, allow use of copyrighted works without owner’s consent. Use is privileged for purposes like: criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research. None of these purposes automatically signifies fair use. Requires determination of purpose/character of use, part used, effect on market or work’s value.

\*Steps 1 and 2 are in conversation with each other - what particular aspect of the work of art is it that you are/aren’t copying?

**102a, Step 1** - **Is there copyright protection?**

1. Original (see *Feist v. Rural Telegraph*)
2. Work of authorship
3. Fixed in tangible medium

Section 102b

* Not an idea, concept, principle / process, system, method?

**106, Step 2** - **Is there copyright infringement?**

* (*Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin*)

**107, Step 3** - **Is there a fair use defense?**

* (*Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin*)

1. Purpose and character of the work
2. Nature of the copyrighted work
3. Amount and sustainability of the portion used
4. Effect on the market value of original

*Feist v. Rural Telephone Service Company* (1991)

Importance: To be granted copyright protection, works must be original, meaning that they entail some minimal degree of creativity. Facts alone are not copyrightable, but a creative/original compilation of facts may be copyrightable.

Facts: Rural Telephone Service published phonebook alphabetically listing the names of its subscribers in its white pages. Rural obtained the information for its white pages directly from its subscribers. Feist Publications distributed a similar phonebook covering a larger geographical area. To obtain its white pages listings, Feist contacted Rural and other phone companies offering to pay to use their white pages listings, but Rural denied permission bc the companies compete for advertising revenue. But Feist used Rural listings anyway, so Rural sued Feist for copyright infringement.

Holding: An alphabetical phonebook, although a specific selection and arrangement of facts, is not creative enough to be considered an original work and thus does not warrant copyright protection. Facts are not copyrightable, and although compilations of facts may be if consist of some degree of creativity, they are not copyrightable per se. Although Rural selected which facts to include, they are arranged alphabetically, which is not a creative arrangement. Rural’s phonebook is not copyrightable and Feist cannot be held liable for copyright infringement.

Note:

* Rural’s potential arguments:
  + Sweat of the brow doctrine (Locke, *INS*) - put the work in (better for Rural)
  + Creative selection doctrine - used facts in creative way (less strong for Rural)
* “In summary, the 1976 revisions to the Copyright Act leave no doubt that originality, not “sweat of the brow,” is the touchstone of copyright protection in directories and other fact-based works…The selection, coordination, and arrangement of Rural’s white pages do not satisfy the minimum constitutional standards for copyright protection.”
* Different jurisdictions held by dif doctrines. This court rejects that these facts are creative, and test for whether compilation comes within original work of authorship category is that it is created independently with some modicum of creativity.
* Glass: Court may be using originality as proxy for amount of labor you put in, the quality you’re creating, and its overall usefulness.

*Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin* (11th Cir. 2001):

Importance: Fair Use Doctrine – not infringement if the new work uses the copyrighted work for purposes of comment/critique/parody.

Rule: Use of a copyrighted work (through use of characters, plotlines, and major scenes) may not be copyright infringement where the use is for purposes of critique, comment, or parody.

Facts: Houghton Mifflin published The Wind Done Gone (TWDG) based on the famous book, Gone with the Wind (GWTW). TWDG served as a critique of the depiction of slavery in the south in GWTW by using its characters, plot, and major scenes. SunTrust is copyright holder of GWTW and brought copyright infringement suit against Houghton Mifflin.

Holding: Not enjoined from publication based on copyright infringement bc Fair Use Doctrine. In determining whether a work is entitled to the Fair Use defense, court looks at following factors. Court looks at all factors, but weighs some more heavily than others.

1. Purpose and character of the work
2. Nature of the copyrighted work
3. Amount and sustainability of the portion used
4. Effect on the market value of original

Use of a copyright is permitted to fulfill one of the important purposes listed in Copyright Clause:

1. Promotion of learning

* Provides public access to knowledge bc it provides an economic incentive for authors to publish books, thus increasing public access to new ideas and concepts

1. Protection of the public domain

* Grant of a copyright encourages public to create new works, and the limitation ensures that that the works will eventually enter the public domain, which protects public’s right of access and use

1. Exclusive rights of the author

* To encourage creation of original works

PROCESS FOR ANALYZING:

1. Threshold question: Would a reasonable person see the work as being of parodic character? (Rule: Parody = having an aim “to criticize a prior work by appropriating elements of the original in creating a new artistic, as opposed to scholarly or journalistic, work.)
2. Does the work fall within the Fair Use Doctrine in light of the four factors listed in the statute?

* **Purpose and character of the work** (commercial nature of for nonprofit education purposes)
  + TWDG is a commercial product, which weighs against fair use, but because TWDG adds a new meaning to GWTW by transforming its copyrighted elements into a critique, this factor as a whole weighs **in favor**.
* **Nature of the copyrighted work**
  + Bc GWTW is an original work of fiction, it is entitled to a high degree of protection and so this factor weights **against**.
* **Amount and sustainability of the portion used**
  + TWDG does take a substantial portion of GWTW; however, a certain portion is necessary in order to “conjure up” an image of GWTW, which is necessary for the criticism. Copyright protection affords greater protection to original works of fiction, but this prong is irrelevant here bc TWDG is parody, drawing on publicly known work. As a result, this factor remains **neutral**.
* **Effect on the market value of original**
  + Unlikely that TWDG would supplant GWTW in the marketplace because they are such different works in different genres, so this factor weighs **in favor.**

Accordingly, based on an analysis of the factors as a whole, TWDG is entitled to a fair use defense / copyright use bc only 1/4 factors weighs against defense, but 2/4 weigh in favor.

**Acquisition By Invention: Patent**

**CASES**: *A.M.P. v. Myriad* (2013); *Moore v. Regents* (Cal. 1990)

Patents – Grant inventors of machines, processes, and compositions of matter a monopoly/protection over inventions for up to 20 years. Granted by the PTO (unlike copyrights, which exist from the moment a work is first fixed into a tangible form).

Substantive limits on patents – only granted if all reqs of 5 factor test met:

1. Subject matter is patentable (machine, process/method of manufacture, composition of matter)
2. Novel
3. Nonobvious
4. Useful
5. Fully and particularly described

**US Constitution Art. I, cl. 8. Copyright Clause**

Provides power to create/provide copyrights/patents.Authorizes Congress to “promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.”

**Section 101 of Patent Act (35 U.S.C. § 101)**

“Whoever **invents** or **discovers** any new and useful… composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.”

*A.M.P. v. Myriad* (2013): **DETERMINING PUBLIC RIGHTS OF ACCESS**

Importance: Naturally occurring phenomena are not patentable.

Rule: A naturally occurring DNA segment is not patentable merely bc it has been isolated.

Facts: Myriad discovered exact location of BRCA genes, created genetic tests to isolate genes and test for BRCA mutation / increased risk, sold tests for ~$4K, ¼ price if patent removed. Obtained several patents, including: one that gave Myriad exclusive right to **isolate** BRCA genes, and one that gave Myriad exclusive right to synthetically **create** BRCA genes from mRNA —> cDNA.

Holding: BRCA1 and BRCA2 are naturally occurring molecules and are not patentable. cDNA is patentable because it is not naturally occurring, but is instead produced by a lab technician based on DNA.

Reasoning:

35 U.S.C. § 101: “Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful . . . composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefore.”

* BRCA1 and BRCA2 (not patentable):
  + Naturally occurring, not created by Myriad.
    - Under §101, courts have held that naturally occurring things may not be patented. At odds with point of patents - to promote creation. Myriad’s isolation of this pair of genes is not “new... composition of matter.”
  + Groundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant **discovery** does not by itself satisfy the §101 inquiry, nor does extensive **effort**
* cDNA (patentable): cDNA is created in a lab and is not naturally occurring

Notes:

* Court relies mainly on efficiency arguments
* Well-established standard: “incentives that lead to creation, invention, and discovery” v. “impeding the flow of information that might permit/spur invention”. Must apply this standard here to determine whether Myriad’s patents claim any “new and useful... composition of matter” (patentable), or instead claim naturally occurring phenomena (not patentable).
* Black women have significantly higher breast cancer mortality rates than white women, per state.
* What is not implicated by this decision:
  + Method - Had Myriad created an innovative method of manipulating genes while searching for the BRCA1/2, could have sought a method patent. But, Myriad’s processes for DNA isolation were well understood, widely used, and fairly uniform amongst all scientists searching for genes.
  + New applications - As first party with knowledge of BRCA1/2 sequences, Myriad was in excellent position to claim applications of that knowledge. Many of its unchallenged claims are limited to such applications, which are patentable.
  + Scientific alteration of genetic code - if not simply isolated but rather altered sequence of nucleotides, patentable.
* Court treats DNA like news - as something existing in the world ?

*Moore v. Regents* (Cal. 1990): **DETERMINING RIGHTS OF DONORS**

Importance: Bodily autonomy does not come with the “bundle of rights” of normal property interest – you do not retain property interest in your body after a piece of it is removed.

Rule:

1) A patient’s consent to a medical procedure will not be effective if physician failed to disclose her personal research and economic interests beforehand.

* Moore has cause of action against Golde for invading a legally protected patient interest.

2) Once cells leave / are removed from a patient’s body after surgery, he no longer has sufficient ownership rights over the cells to uphold a conversion claim.

* Since Moore did not expect to retain possession of his cells following their removal, to sue for their conversion he must have retained an ownership interest in them (property interest in cells or patent).

Facts: Moore undergoes treatment for hairy-cell leukemia at UCLA Medical Center. Has spleen removed, blood drawn.

Doctors manufacture cell line based on blood cells (lymphokines) for profitable research without obtaining Moore’s

consent, and obtain a patent for the cell line.

Reasoning:

1. Moore was commoditizing something that shouldn’t be commoditized (**Radin**). Worried about the possibility of a world where you could put your body parts on a market.
   * Moore’s argument—the industry is commoditizing my body, and you’re rewarding them for taking my body and profiting, you’re just not allowing me to have the profits;
   * So there’s the second move possible—if you’re concerned about commoditization, can make it a rule not to sell, you can only give it away.
2. Fairness: Lymphokines, unlike name or face, have same molecular structure in every human being. Not unique.
3. Consistency with Existing Law: Statues already regulate tissue disposal limit control over excised cells for reasons of public health and safety. Such statutes already eliminate rights ordinarily attached to property.
4. Fairness/Labor: Patented cell line is factually and legally distinct from cells in Moore’s body. Federal law permits patenting organisms that are products of “human ingenuity,” not discovery of naturally occurring organisms (the original cells in Moore’s body)
5. Social Utility: Risk of disincentivizing research by exposing researchers engaged in socially useful activity to liability – thousands of lines already exist in tissue repositories; routinely copied and distributed.
6. Role of Courts/Institutional Competence: “If scientific uses of human cells are to be held liable for failing to investigate the consensual pedigree of their raw materials, we believe the legislature should make that decision.”

Concurrence, Arabian: Moore trying to comingle the sacred (body/cell) and the profane (property, aka human creation).

* **Radin**: it degrades the human being to treat tissue as fungible

Dissent, Mosk:

* If we see property concept as a bundle of entitlements that may be exercised with respect to an object, then we can say that Moore can get rid of some rights while holding on to the core. 1) right to possess, 2) right to use, 3) right to exclude, 4) right to transfer. Majority says because discarded tissue is regulated, there is no property interest.
* It is possible to recognize some property interests and not others in object (contracts can limit transfer of real property, etc.)
* The bargaining power is too weak for a patient for him to give up a property right. This exploitation of Moore’s body for the benefit of another is akin to slavery and should not be tolerated.
* Fairness: Cell line is primarily the work product of Regents, but Moore’s contribution is critical. Without his cell, the product wouldn’t exist. Although Regents is the rightful patent holder, Moore had a critical contribution to the invention, as without his cells there would have been no invention. Regents was unjustly enriched, and Moore should be compensated accordingly.

Arguments:

* Moore: Cell lines are unique.
  + Cell lines are unique like a human likeness, which is protected under privacy rights (i.e. celebrities have proprietary interest in own likeness, and unauthorized commercial use of likeness is redressible as a tort.)
  + His cell line is his property.
* Regents: Cell lines are not unique.
  + Marketed cell line is new creation
  + Value created through their labor (**Locke**)
  + Labor also created an expectation to gain advantage from ownership (Bentham)

Notes:

* #fixbill101 – Proposed bill from June 2019 that permits patenting natural phenomena.
* Senator Tillis & Coons, June 2019 (proposed the bill)– **“**The US patent system with regard to patent eligibility is broken and desperately needs to be repaired. The US Supreme Court has confused and narrowed Section 101 of the Patent Act to the point that investors are reluctant to pursue the innovations that propel our country forward.”

**Unit Two:**

THE THREE ACCESS DOCTRINES

1. **Adverse Possession (kind of)**—By using someone’s land, the true owner cannot exclude after time passes and the title is transferred;
2. **Trespass/Public Accommodation**—the right to exclude is limited by certain fairness considerations (civil rights statutes; common carriers)
   1. There are the considerations of need—*State v. Shack*;
   2. And the considerations of Constitutional rights—*Marsh v. Alabama.*
3. **Public Trust**—certain kinds of property are inherently public, meaning that you cannot exclude without undermining commerce
   1. Should be inalienable (connection to **Radin** -some property should not be sold)

Trespass = An unprivileged and intentional entry on land possessed by another.

* may be physical entry by a person, agent, or an object
* could be above or below the surface

Traditional common law: “Whoever owns the soil also owns up to the heavens and down to the depths.”

Modern rule: To the sky, airplane overflights that do not interfere with the surface owner’s use of the land do not give rise to a cause of action for trespass.

Multiple defenses to trespass: *State v. Shack, Commonwealth v. Magadini, Desnick, Food Lion*

Competing views on the right to exclude – is it absolute?: *State v. Shack* VERSUS. *Jaques v. Steenberg*

*State v. Shack* (NJ 1971): **PUBLIC POLICY**

Importance: Public policy encourages limitation of the right to exclude. A right to exclude does not overcome public policy considerations.

Rule: Ownership of real property is not absolute. Owner’s right to exclude does not override human values, nor include right to refuse access to individuals providing government services in private to workers housed on the property.

Facts: Federally funded workers (lawyer and social worker) entered private property farm to help migrant farm workers in private. Part of such aid was supposed to be giving legal advice to one of the migrant farm workers courtesy of a nonprofit corporation funded by the gov pursuant to an act of Congress, plus health services. Charged with trespass and $50 fine. (Impact litigation.)

Holding: Under the NJ state common law of trespass, ownership of real property does not include the right to bar access to federally funded anti-poverty agencies who seek to provide legal and health services to migrant farmworkers. Representatives who provide such services are thus beyond the reach of the criminal trespass statute. The aid workers did not trespass.

Notes:

* Bc of industrialization and increasing complexity of society, shift from pure individualism to increasing public needs. Property rights cannot allow a landowner to deny migrant worker practical access to needs.
* 4 possible rationales for holding:

1. Possessory interests of migrant farmworkers – Court balances with property owner’s possessory interest
2. Necessity – Necessity of public policy allowing gov-funded workers to enter and privately assist
3. Reliance – Farmer and farmworkers people are involved in an ongoing relationship and becoming increasingly dependent on each other over time. The court can intervene to impose a set of obligations to ensure that the balance of rights are consistent with that valued dynamic. Migrant workers are “rootless and isolated” and don’t know their own rights.
4. Market inalienability – Home, personhood; some property is so important to you that it should not be in the marketplace at all. People’s homes should not be looked at through the lens of whether you can bargain with employer/landowner to attain access.

* “Property rights serve human values. They are recognized to that end, and are limited by it. Title to real property cannot include dominion over the destiny of persons the owner permits to come upon the premises. Their well-being must remain the paramount concern of a system of law. Indeed the needs of the occupants may be so imperative and their strength so weak, that the law will deny the occupants the power to contract away what is deemed essential to their health, welfare, or dignity.”

*Commonwealth v. Magadini* (Mass. 2016): **NECESSITY**

Importance: Once the foundational requirements are met, the necessity defense allows a jury to consider the plight of a homeless person against any harms caused by trespass before determining criminal responsibility

Facts: Defendant was homeless and entered buildings he was barred from by no-trespass orders. Six different charges against the defendant are challenged in this case. In each circumstance he trespassed the property after being barred from them. Requested a jury instruction on the defense of necessity, asserting that his conduct was justified as the only lawful alternative for a homeless person facing the “clear and imminent danger” of exposure to the elements during periods of extreme outdoor temperatures.

* Necessity – exonerates one who commits a crime under the pressure of circumstances if the harm that would have resulted from compliance with the law exceeds the harm resulting from defendant’s violation of the law
* Necessity Defense 4 elements to be entitled:

1. A clear and imminent danger (not one which is debatable or speculative)
2. A reasonable expectation that his or her action will be effective as a direct cause of abating the danger
3. There is no legal alternative that will be effective in abating the danger
4. The Legislature has not acted to preclude the defense

Holding: Trial court committed error in refusing the defendant’s request for a jury instruction on the necessity defense when, as here, the defendant satisfied the foundational elements entitling him to the defense by showing that there was “reasonable doubt” about the availability of legal alternatives to abate a clear and imminent danger. There was “little question” that the weather conditions presented a “clear and imminent danger” for a homeless person.

Notes:

* Court hones in on element 3: legal alternative to trespass. Court will not require that every potential alternative was exhausted; defendant must only rebut alternatives that would likely have been considered by a reasonable person in a similar situation.
* Incidents from Feb to late March. Timing in the early morning or late evening hours, when defendant was either sleeping or lying down, suggests the dangerousness of the circumstances where sleeping may keep one in the same position for an extended period, and thus increases potential harm from the weather.
* Efficiency justification: incentivizes minimizing harm as much as possible by, for example, sleeping in a public area rather than knocking on people’s homes

*Desnick v. ABC* (7th Cir., 1995): **CONSENT**

Importance: Consent induced by fraud constitutes a valid defense to trespass.

Rule: Entry onto another’s property is not unlawful trespassing if it does not interfere with the owner’s ownership or possession of the property.

Facts: ABC gained permission to enter an eye surgery for a story without revealing their investigative intention, then sent undercover patients to the clinic and used concealed cameras to record patients being advised to receive unnecessary operations. The clinic was told that the journalists would do “a fair and balanced report.”

Reasoning: Posner’s reasoning focuses on the level of interference with the plaintiff’s right to peaceful association by the journalists’ conduct: there is no harm, no disruption, and no filming of intimate details. Entry did not invade the kind of interest that the law of trespass is intended to protect (ownership/possession). Also, the right to exclude is limited by the kind of people you invite into your property. The tort of trespass doesn't protect against these people even if they are fraudulent.

*Food Lion v. Capital Cities* (4th Cir., 1999): **CONSENT**

Importance:

Rule: You are trespassing if you have exceeded the scope of invitation by performing acts that are not what a normal person in your position would do.

Facts: ABC sent TV reporters to Food Lion supermarkets with false resumes and secretly videotaped the ‘food handling’ process. Like *Desnick*, reporters gained access under false pretenses. Unlike *Desnick*, reporters had not first asked for permission to film, even under false pretenses.

Holding: There was no trespass upon entry (according to *Desnick*) but there was trespass when the crew

began filming, because they exceeded the scope of their invitation.

Reasoning:

1. In Desnick the office knew that (1) they were filming, and they were (2) arguably doing what a patient would do
2. Here, the crew did more than what a normal employee would do by videotaping—additionally, they filmed in an area that was not accessible by the public, which is more akin to stealing trade secrets

*Jacque v. Steenberg Homes* (WI 1997): **DECIDING REMEDIES**

Importance: There is an interest in deterring intentional trespasser, which relies on protection/support from legal system

Rule: Under Wisconsin law, a jury has discretion to award punitive damages for intentional trespasses, even if compensatory damages were not warranted and only nominal damages were awarded.

Facts: Steenberg Homes sold a mobile home to a neighbor of the Jacques. Because of snow on the nearest town road, the easiest way for Steenberg to deliver the mobile home was over the Jacques’ property. However, the Jacques refused to grant Steenberg permission to do so. Steenberg proceeded to deliver the mobile home across the Jacques’ property anyway. The Jacques notified the sheriff, and Steenberg was issued a $30 citation. Jury awarded the Jacques $1 nominal in damages and $100,000 in punitive damages.

Arguments:

* Steenberg: a jury cannot award punitive damages in this case because there were no actual damages.
* Jacques: individuals and society want to deter trespass regardless of measurable harm that results.

Holding: A jury may award Jacques with $100K in punitive damages if Steenberg’s fine was only $30 and jury awarded only nominal damages. Individual interests in the right to exclude and societal interests in deterring trespass are great enough to warrant a monetary penalty that will actually change behavior.

Reasoning:

* Enforcing Rights: The actual harm here is not in any physical damage to the land, but in the denial of the owner's legal right to exclude all others. Private landowner’s right to exclude is “one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.” *Dolan v. City of Tigard* (1994). A right is illusory if it is unenforceable.
* Individual Interests: There’s a strong individual interest in right to exclude. That individual right requires protection from state. Every trespass causes actual harm, regardless of whether compensatory damages.
* Societal Interests: Promote integrity of and reliance on legal system. Punitive damages are necessary to prevent further wrongdoing. Serve as a deterrent to illegal activity where the damages are greater than the profit to be gained by that misconduct.

Note:

* The general rule in Wisconsin is that punitive damages are unavailable if unsupported by compensatory damages. *Barnard v. Cohen* (1917). The rationale for this is simply that society’s interest in deterring unlawful but unharmful conduct is not great enough to warrant punitive damages.
* Nevertheless, the question of whether punitive damages are available when supported by a nominal damage award for intentional trespass has not been answered.
* An exception to *Barnard* is warranted in cases of intentional trespass. Repeated trespasses could actually threaten the individual’s ownership by giving the trespasser rights by prescription or adverse possession.

**Adverse Possession**

**CASES**: *Brown v. Gobble*, *Nome 2000 v. Fagerstrom*

RULE TO ESTABLISH ADVERSE POSSESSION:

Unprivileged entry onto land possessed by another is a trespass, but title may pass from the true owner to that trespasser if the possession of land is:

1. Actual
2. Open and notorious
3. Exclusive
4. Adverse or hostile
5. Continuous
6. For a prescribed statutory period (usually 10 years)

THREE WAYS ADVERSE POSSESSION CLAIMS CAN BE BROUGHT

1. As a claim to quiet title against the record owner, where the claimant seeks a declaratory judgment that

the adverse possessor has become the owner of the disputed property (*Romero*)

2. As a defense to trespass;

3. As a defense to ejectment (*Nome 2000*)

HOW TO DEFEAT ADVERSE POSSESSION CLAIMS

* Give **permission**—defeats the adverse or hostile element;
* File suit before the end of the statutory period

ELEMENTS OF ADVERSE POSSESSION

1. Possession must be **actual possession**, i.e. physical occupation;
   1. The adverse possessor must physically occupy the land and put it to “ordinary use to which the land is capable and such as an owner would make of it.” (*Smith v. Hayden*);
      1. Can be shown by enclosing it in a fence—but not a “fence of convenience,” such as one to keep out animals, that does not count.
      2. Can also be shown by building on it, improving on it, acting as an **average owner** would—that’s the most key part.
   2. May be established with **color of title** if the deed is defective.
2. Possession must be **open and notorious**;
   1. Possessory acts must be sufficiently visible and obvious to put a **reasonable owner on notice** that her property is being occupied by a non-owner, like:
      1. Enclosing land in a fence or a wall (*Brown v. Gobble*);
      2. Building a structure or laying down a driveway;
      3. Mowing grass, clearing trees, clearing land, etc.
      4. Isolated clearing of trees, but not enclosing, is **not enough**;
3. Possession must be **exclusive**;
   1. The use “is of a type that would be expected of a true owner of the land in question” and that “the adverse claimant’s possession cannot be shared with the true owner.” (*Nome 2000)*;
   2. Occasioned entry by the true owner is not enough to defeat the claim;
   3. Two adverse possessors can become co-owners—you just have to exclude the true owner.
4. Possession must be **adverse or hostile**;
   1. The possessor’s use must be non-permissive—there’s a presumption that possession of another’s property is usually non-permissive.
   2. Majority rule uses an **objective test**: the possessor’s state of mind is irrelevant, you only need a lack of permission and consistent usage that an average owner would do;
      1. **BUT** to acquire AP against a co-owner, you need to make an explicit statement of intent to take possession—an **ouster**.
      2. **AND** possession that was originally permissive stays that way until the owner makes an explicit statement otherwise.
   3. Minority rule has three possible subjective tests:
      1. **Claim of right**: Adverse possessor must allege a “claim of right” like an intention to appropriate land—some states will defeat an adverse possession claim where the possessor knew where the boundary was but never *intended to claim* property outside her borders as her own;
         1. Very close to the objective test.
      2. **Intentional dispossession**: the adverse possessor must be aware she is occupying property owned by someone else and must intend to oust or dispossess.
         1. Not **efficient**: rewards wrongdoing;
         2. But perhaps **socially useful** (Locke)—good for underutilized property to go towards a more productive use;
         3. And there is an **efficiency** argument in that it would encourage landowners to defend their land.
      3. **Good Faith** (like the Gobbles): In some jurisdictions, only those who mistakenly occupy property owned by someone else can acquire ownership
5. Possession must be **continuous** through the statutory period;
   1. The possessor must exercise control over a property in ways customarily pursued by owners of that type of property;
   2. Extended absences or seasonal uses cannot be used to defeat the claim;
   3. **Tacking** can be used to establish continuous use.
6. The **Statute of Limitations must pass**;
   1. **Tacking** can be used to establish the passage of the statute of limitations;
   2. The statute of limitations can be **tolled** for people with a disability.
   3. Some states lower the statute of limitations when the possessor has **color of title**.
7. Some states also require **color of title** or **payment of property taxes** (*Romero*)

COLOR OF TITLE

(*Romero v. Garcia*) – Refers to defective deed, which prevents transferring title. In some states it’s an element for AP (New Mexico), while in others not. Can be acquired when a conveyance appears to pass title from one owner to another, but it fails to do so because of a defect in the process or deed:

* the person attempting to convey the land lacks title,
* the mode of conveyance is defective,
* or the deed is not in the proper form.

Justifications/critiques:

* It’s **fair** - it protects expectations of passage of title from one person to another, and full bundle of rights that are transferred
* It’s **inefficient** - it incentivizes sloppiness.

Constructive possession: Adverse possession of *any* portion of land described in a document providing color of title is sufficient to establish adverse possession over *all* of the land described in the document. A defective deed/intended conveyance does not usually constitute permission and defeat the adverse and hostile element of adverse possession.

TACKING

(*Brown v. Gobble*) – Allows succeeding periods of possession by different persons to be added together to establish elements to an adverse possession claim, but only if those people were in privity.

* “To tack different adverse possessions to make up the period of bar the persons holding such possessions must be connected by privity of title or claim.” (*Brown v. Gobble*)
* It doesn’t count if the successor dispossessed the original owner forcibly.

OTHER ELEMENTS OF ADVERSE POSSESSION DOCTRINE

* It is generally held that adverse possession claims will not prevail against government property—although some states have abolished government immunity;
* Adverse possessors usually get non-possessory interests as well, like mineral interests;
* There are still questions about what is necessary for an adverse possessor to use rural land as an “average owner” would, and whether the acts to be open and notorious must be greater to properly give notice to a reasonable owner.

JUSTIFICATIONS FOR ADVERSE POSSESSION

* Stale claims / Promotes alienability – Uncertainty inhibits transactions or raises their costs, thereby lowering their profitability. People can sell only what they own, but if unclear what they own, inhibited from entering transactions because of the risk that they will not in fact be buying/selling what the are purporting to
* Quieting title / Administrability – giving root of title you extinguish potential litigation baggage that could drag down market for real estate. Don't have to re-litigate every time try to transfer right of possession to next person
* Penalizing the sleeping owner – Prevents valuable resources from being left idle, efficiency concern
* Efficiency – Lowers the cost of identifying who the owner is
* Reliance – Protecting the possessor’s interests and expectations
* **Locke** – Your labor.
* **Cooter & Ulen**: Two economic justifications for adverse possession:

1. By quieting title & closing off stale claims, AP “lowers the cost of establishing rightful ownership claims by removing the risk that ownership will be disputed on the basis of the distant past.”

* If it is unclear what people own, they will be inhibited from entering transactions because of the risk that they will not in fact be buying/selling what they are purporting to buy/sell. AP settles the dispute, allows further transactions to take place, lowers cost of determining title holder. Less expensive to rely on rule of ownership than on litigation.

1. Prevents valuable resources from being left idle for long periods of time by specifying procedures for a productive user to take title from an unproductive user.

* **Justice Holmes**, *Tioga Coal Co. v. Supermarkets General Corp.* (Pa. 1988): Adverse possession is designed to protect the expectations of the adverse possessor who has come to “shape his roots to his surroundings, and when the roots have grown to a certain size, cannot be displaced without cutting at his life.” True owner’s recovery of the land would be unexpected windfall. A person also loses attachment to a property he regards as no longer his own, and the restoration of the property would give him only moderate pleasure.
* **Justice Posner** (7th Cir., Economic Analysis of Laws): Translates Holmes’ explanation into language of wealth, utility. Over time, person becomes psychologically/economically attached to land they regard as own. Deprivation of it would be “wrenching.” “Diminishing marginal utility of income” point: Adverse possessor would experience the deprivation of property as diminution of his wealth, while original owner would experience the restoration of property as an increase in his wealth. If they have the same wealth, their combined utility will be greater if the adverse possessor is allowed to keep the property.
* **Sterk**: Willingness to pay is a poor metric for measuring degree to which adverse possessor values the property.
* **Penaver & Kaytal**: AP’s long-term use/improvement of the property, combined with the risk of civil/criminal sanctions, will in many cases constitute strong prima facie evidence that adverse possessor places high value on the property.
* **Radin**: Translates Holmes’ explanation into language of justice/fairness. Fungible v. personal property. AP’s interest is initially fungible but becomes increasingly personal with time, while titleholder’s interest moves oppositely, and finally to nothingness. Timing where attachment/detachment demands a switch requires a moral judgment.
* **Merrill**: Moral basis for adverse possession lies in “the reliance interests that the possessor may have developed through longstanding possession of the property.” Adverse possession is justified by moral principle of protecting reliance on relationships.

*Brown v. Gobble* (W. Va. 1996): **TACKING**

Importance: Tacking can assist in establishing continuity.

Rule: One who seeks to assert title in land by adverse possession must prove each of the following for a period of more than ten years: that he has held the land adversely and that the possession has been actual, open and notorious, exclusive, continuous, and under a claim of title or color of title. Tacking: As long as the transfer of possession of the land in question was made in privity of title or claim, one claiming adverse possession may add his years in adverse possession to those of a predecessor to establish the statutory minimum.

Facts: The Gobbles (defendants) and Browns (plaintiffs) were owners of neighboring properties in West Virginia. The properties were divided by a 2 ft wide tract of land that appeared to be part of Gobble property, bc was enclosed on the Gobbles’ side of the property line by a fence. But was owned by the Browns, who also bought property by deed which included enclosed tract as theirs. Browns decided to build a road along the tract, Gobbles asserted it was theirs, Browns sued to enjoin the Gobbles from using tract. At the time of the suit, the Gobbles had been in possession for only 9.5 years, when the statute of limitations required 10 years.

Holding: To establish tacking/continuity element, Gobbles showed evidence that Fletchers, Blevins (original owners) acted as owners of the land before them too. The elements of adverse possession are considered in light of the tacking doctrine, so the prior owners must comply too.

*Nome 2000 v. Fagerstrom* (Alaska 1990): **USE AS AVERAGE OWNER ON ONLY A PORTION OF LAND**

Importance: Adverse possession standards are different in rural Alaska bc use as average owner is dependent on character of land.

Rule: The actions required for adverse possession depend on the character of the land in question. The requirements will be met if the land is used for the statutory period as an average owner of similar property would use it.

Facts: Nome 2000 is the record title holder of the entire parcel. Fagerstroms used northern parcel of land seasonally—it was not suited for winter residency—for several years. Put stakes down in the parcel, built shelter, then cabin. During that time, they let others use the entire property for picking berries, going on walks, enjoying the waterfront. Only used southern parcel for recreation on preexisting trails and picking up trash. Nome 2000 sued to eject Fagerstroms, who counterclaimed that they acquired the parcel by adverse possession. Nome 2000 appealed, arguing that adverse possession elements were not satisfied, and that even if they were, the Fagerstroms only acquired the northern section of the parcel.

Holding: Fagerstroms satisfied reqs for adverse possession of northern parcel. Have acquired adverse possession of northern parcel, but use of the trails and picking up trash are not sufficient to provide a reasonable owner notice bc any visitor or passerby would use the land in the same way.

Notes:

* Conditions for notorious, continuous, and exclusive use require only that the land be used for the statutory period as an **average owner** of similar property would use it – and an average owner of rural land would let others use their land for picking berries, walking through, and only use seasonally.
* Placing two posts on a portion of land that is otherwise used does not count as possession, because it does not give the owners fair **notice** – and so adverse possessors can be granted only portions of land that they use, in addition to the entire parcel

*Davis v. Evans* (Mo. 1853):

Importance: A master who permits his infant slave to remain with its mother during infancy, free from his control, will not be construed to have abandoned his right to possession of the child. The possession of the mother will not be adverse possession (as is protected by the statute of limitation) bc a free negro cannot hold slaves.

Facts: Woman had a child while she was enslaved. She was then emancipated. Her infant slave daughter lived with her and she claimed adverse possession.

Holding: The court did not allow adverse possession for two reasons:

* Goal is to allow children to live with their parents and granting AP will prevent that
* Freed slaves cannot own slaves

Note: **Harris**: Woman racialized in such a way that the court stated that they were acting for the good of enslaved people by not allowing adverse possession in this case.

**Prescriptive Easements**

**CASES**: *Community Feed Store v. Northeastern Culvert Corp.* (Vt. 1989); *Zuni Tribe v. Platt* (D. Ariz. 1990); *Davis v. Evans* (Mo. 1853)

FOUR TYPES OF EASEMENTS

By Estoppel, by Prescription, by Prior Use, and by Necessity. Prescriptive Easements mirror the doctrine of Adverse Possession. If the scope of the non-owner’s actions is limited to a narrow use of another’s land rather than general possession of it, she may be granted a prescriptive easement rather than title by adverse possession.

**EASEMENT**: Limited rights to use the property of another.

* Affirmative: the right to engage in a particular use on another’s land
  + i.e. Right of way = right to cross neighboring property
  + CAN be acquired by prescription
* Negative: the right to limit/block a particular use of another’s land
  + i.e. Right to prevent a neighbor from adding an extra story onto her building
  + CANNOT be acquired by prescription

**PRESCRIPTIVE EASEMENT:** Created through USE (not possession, like adverse possession) of the land that is:

1. Actual
2. Open and notorious

* General rule is that open and notorious use is presumed to be adverse (*Community Feed Store*).

1. Continuous
2. Exclusive

* Most courts drop the exclusivity requirement.

1. Adverse

* Jurisdictions vary on the kind of adversity required (*Community Feed Store*).

Assess: Does the jurisdiction have a presumption of non-permissiveness?

* In most states, if all other elements are met, use/possession is presumptively non-permissive
* In some states, courts hold that use (but not possession) is presumptively permissive

1. Until expiration of the statute of limitations for trespass.

**ACQUIESCENCE**

A significant number of states require the claimant to prove acquiescence by the true owner.

Assess: Does the jurisdiction have an acquiescence requirement? If so, what is the test for acquiescence?

* Whether true owner asserted her right to exclude by bringing a trespass action?
* Whether true owner must have known about the use and allowed it to continue?
* Whether true owner would have or should have known about the use and allowed it to continue?

Contradiction between acquiescence and adversity: How can owner both acquiesce to a use, and not permit it?

* For some courts, acquiescence merely means owner did not assert right to exclude by bringing a trespass action.
* Or, that reasonable owner should have known (duplicative with open and notorious).
* Or, that landowner must have known about the use; passively allowed it to continue without granting permission.

*Community Feed Store v. Northeastern Culvert Corp.* (Vt. 1989): **DOCTRINE**

Importance: It is sufficient to establish a claim of prescriptive easement if one claims the general outlines of the area of his continuous, adverse, and notorious use with reasonable certainty

Rule: General outlines sufficient to establish prescriptive easement. Just must show it is consistent with the pattern of use.

Facts: Gravel lot between Community Feed Store (animal feed business) and Northeastern (business). Feed Store used lot as a turnaround area for vehicles coming to Feed Store’s building to pick up/drop off feed. Feed Store and its predecessors used the land for this purpose from 1929 until Northeastern found out that it owned part of the lot and built a barrier in 1984. The statutory period for establishing a prescriptive easement in Vermont is 15 years. Feed Store claimed prescriptive easement.

Holding: Feed Store has a prescriptive easement over the other business’s driveway because it was open, notorious, continuous and adverse for a period longer than the statutory requirement of 15 years (had chain of title back to 1929).

Note:

* Vermont jurisdiction requires acquiescence of owner.
* Like in Adverse Possession claim, in absence of color of title and where no definite boundary marks, prescriptive easement can only extend as far as claimant has actually used the land in dispute.

*Zuni Tribe v. Platt* (D. Ariz. 1990): **USING PROPERTY LAW AFTER DISPOSSESSION**

Rule: Adverse possession means an actual and visible appropriation of the land, commenced and continued under a claim of right inconsistent with and hostile to the claim of another.

Facts: Native American tribe had ritual to march through Platt’s land. Had traversed a 110-mile path located on private lands every four years (quadrennial) on a pilgrimage to a scared site, probably since 1540. Platt declared intent to prevent tribe from crossing through, and gov/tribe claimed a prescriptive easement by adverse possession.

Holding: Tribe could claim prescriptive easement. Fulfills all test elements.

Notes:

* “The proof necessary to establish a prescriptive easement to use land is not the same as that to establish a claim of title by adverse possession. [I]t is only the use to which the premises are put which must be shown to be adverse, open and notorious. To the extent that the use is established, it, of course, is hostile to the title of the servient [i.e., burdened] estate.”
* Following the Arizona statutes that generally held rule that in order for one to acquire right to property purely by adverse possession, such possession must be actual, open and notorious, hostile, under a claim of right, continuous for the statutory period of 10 years, and exclusive, the federal district court held that it was clear from the record that the plaintiff tribe met the standards of adverse possession, and the applicable case law for purposes of the limited use sought.

**Public Accommodations Law and the Principle Of Non-discrimination**

**CASES**: *Uston v. Resorts* (NJ 1982); *Arguello v. Conoco* (5th Cir., 2003)

FEDERAL STATUTES

**Civil Rights Act of 1866**

(42 U.S.C. § 1981) All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts....as is enjoyed by white citizens. The term “make and enforce contracts” includes the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.

(42 U.S.C. § 1982) All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.

**Civil Rights Act of 1964** (Title II)

All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin.

STATE STATUTES

1. Three-part test to determine if the statute applies:
   1. Do you count as a protected class under that statute?
   2. Does the place discriminating against you count as a place of public accommodation?
   3. Are there any exceptions that would make the place fall out of the statute?
2. They may go further than federal law in protecting individual rights—they are not preempted under the Supremacy Clause unless they are *inconsistent* with federal law.
3. New York Executive Law §§ 292-96 (pg. 48):
   1. Broader list of public accommodations, including retail stores;
   2. Private club exception—not private if it has more than one hundred members, provides regular meal service, and regularly receives payment for dues, fees…meals or beverages directly or indirectly from or on behalf of a nonmember;
   3. Protected classes—race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, military status, sex, or disability or marital status of any person…
   4. Covers communications and materials indicated protected classes are unwelcome, objectionable, or not acceptable, etc.

**GENERAL RULE**: When a property owner opens his or her property to the general public, they have the right to exclude others for any reason not specifically prohibited by federal laws, provided: the property is not an inn or common carrier, which have a duty to serve the public (*Madden v. Queens*, NY 1947).

**COMMON CARRIERS & INNKEEPER EXCEPTION:** Property owners have an **absolute right to exclude** others from their commercial property for any reason not specifically prohibited by statute, **unless they are a common carrier.** Justifications:

* **Socially useful**: since common carriers are monopolies, denial of service is like a denial to the right to travel or seek shelter
* **Necessity**: common carriers provide necessities whose denial would place individuals at risk
* **Fair** (reliance/expectations): the public relies on the expectation that common carriers are available to serve public needs
* **Corollary**, ***INS v. AP***: The same justifications existed for giving news organizations a qualified right to exclude, because they provide a common good/necessity.

**USTON OUTLIER**: When a property owner opens his or her property to the general public in the pursuit of their own property interest, they have a duty not to act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner toward persons who come on their premises.

* *Uston* reflects an older view of property rights from the mid-19th century that changed when courts began to allow commercial entities to exclude African Americans
* Effectively: **you need a good reason to exclude someone**, otherwise you have a duty to serve. Cannot exclude unreasonably.

*Uston v. Resorts* (NJ 1982): **THE NARROWING OF THE DUTY TO SERVE**

Importance: Minority rule. Majority rule: you can exclude arbitrarily unless you are an innkeeper or a common carrier (in those cases, minority rule governs).

Rule: When property owners open their premises to the general public in the pursuit of their own property interests, they have no right to exclude people arbitrarily. On the contrary, they have a duty not to act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner bc an individual has a right of reasonable access to property open to the public. The only time it is “reasonable” to exclude is in cases of disruptive conduct or when it threatens security.

Facts: Resorts refused to allow Uston near the blackjack tables at its casino because Uston’s strategy of card counting increased his odds of winning. Uston claimed no right to exclude him bc of playing strategy; Resorts argued it had right to exclude arbitrarily.

Holding: Resorts does not have the right to exclude arbitrarily. An individual has a right of reasonable access to property open to the public. The reasonableness of a decision to exclude an individual must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Here, Resorts’ casino is open to the public and Uston’s desire to enter the casino and play blackjack is not unreasonable (not acting unreasonably either; not disrupting operations nor threatening any occupants’ security).

Notes:

* Unlike *State v. Shack*: no unequal bargaining power, no fundamental right to state services implicated.
* Outlier. In most jurisdictions, the majority common law rule is that when a property owner opens his or her property to the general public, they have the right to exclude others for any reason not specifically prohibited by federal laws provided they are not an inn or common carrier, which have a duty to serve the public. (*Madden v. Queens County Jockey Club,* NY 1947)

*Arguello v. Conoco* (5th Cir., 2003):

Rule: To state a claim under the Civil Rights Act of 1866 §1981 in retail context, must demonstrate loss of an actual (not speculative or prospective) contract interest (an attempt to contract that was thwarted by merchant). Court will not recognize claims with respect to conduct occurring after the consummation of the sales contract.

Other Rule: In order for an employer to be held liable for discriminatory acts of its employees under federal statutes, an agency relationship must be established.

* An agency relationship exists between: an employer and an employee who performs acts unacceptable to the employer in the course of employment. Factors:
  + Time, place, purpose of act
  + Acts similar to those authorized to do
  + Extent to which departed from normal methods
  + Whether employer would reasonably expect employee to act in racist manner
* An agency relationship does NOT exist between: a company and stores displaying the company’s brand if the company is not involved in the store’s day-to-day operations.

Facts: Father and daughter Arguello stopped at Conoco store to buy gasoline and other goods. Subjected to racially discriminatory treatment by clerk.

Holding: No valid claim for racial discrimination under Civil Rights Act of 1866 §1981. No agency relationship.

Reasoning: Cannot establish that their attempt to contract was thwarted. Father voluntarily left good on the counter. When he later tried to gain access to the store and was locked out, he wasn’t denied an opportunity to purchase because his intention was to determine the clerk’s identity, not to buy something. The daughter also does not have a valid claim because she was able to successfully complete the transaction.

Notes:

* Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. § 1981) – All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts....as is enjoyed by white citizens. The term “make and enforce contracts” includes the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.
* Case that analogizes FHA disparate treatment test

**Disability-based Exclusion: Americans with Disabilities Act**

**CASES**: *Bragdon v. Abbott* (1998)

**See Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Title III**), **Civil Rights Act of 1866, Civil Rights Act of 1964**  **(Title II)**

**3-PRONG TEST FOR ESTABLISHING ADA VIOLATION**

1. Discrimination (§12182)

* “No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.”
* Failure to do something

1. By a Public Accommodation? (§12181)

* Sec. 12181(7) long list

1. On a Basis of Disability? (§12101)

* “Disability is defined as (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of an individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.”
* Whether the condition is a physical or mental impairment
* Whether the life activity it implicated constitutes a major life activity
* Whether the impairment substantially limited the major life activity. (Met even if difficulties are not insurmountable like HIV.)

*Bragdon v. Abbott* (1998): **APPLYING THE ADA**

Importance: ADA’s definition of disability is non-exhaustive.

Rule: The assessment of whether a significant risk to the health and safety of others exists should be determined by the treatment provider and be based on medical or other objective evidence.

Facts: Defendant is affected by asymptomatic HIV. On dental office info form, disclosed HIV-positive status. After exam, Bragdon informed Abbott of his policy not to fill cavities of HIV-positive patients. Offered to perform the procedure at a hospital, but Abbott would be responsible for cost of using hospital facilities. Abbott declined and sued Bragdon under the ADA, alleging discrimination on the basis of her disability.

Holding: HIV neets statutory definition of disability under the ADA, and so this is discrimination.

1. HIV is a disability with an impairment from the moment of infection – it follows an “unalterable course” that involves an immediate hit to the immune system followed by other impairments. Interrupts and substantially limits reproduction, a major life activity. Financial consequences: costs of therapy, long-term healthcare.

* ADA disability definition

1. Dentist’s office is a place of public accommodation

* ADA “professional office of a health care provider”

1. The service would not endanger the healthcare provider

* ADA prohibits refusing service here

Note:

* ACLU Amicus Brief, *Bragdon v. Abbott*: “All individuals with asymptomatic HIV infection have a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more of their major life activities. HIV substantially limits reproduction, sexual intimacy, caring for one’s self; interactions with others, and more fundamentally, life itself.”

*CIDNY v. MTA* (2017):

Importance: ADA seeks to eradicate disability-based discrimination conducted by public entities.

Complaint: MTA is a public entity. Claim – breach of duty: “fail to operate a designated public transportation program or activity…when viewed in its entirety, the program or activity is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.”

**Public Function Doctrine: First Amendment**

**CASES**: *Marsh v. Alabama* (1946), *Lloyd Corporation v. Tanner* (1972), *Prager v. Google* (2018)

*Hudgens v. NLRB*: “It is, of course, a commonplace that the constitutional guarantees of free speech is a guarantee only against abridgment by government, federal or state.”

STATE ACTION DOCTRINE

Bill of Rights constrains the actions of the state, NOT of private actors**.** State Action Doctrine is solution to a problem that emerged after the 14th Amendment: What is the reach of equal opportunity privileges and immunities? **OLD RULE**: Focus should be on the states, and prohibiting them from denying freed slaves constitutional rights. Private actors can do what they want.

POLICY REASONS WHY PUBLIC ACTORS SHOULD HAVE GREATER DUTY THAN PRIVATE ACTORS:

* Monopoly over force
* Monopoly over facilities/services
* Democracy-enhancing effects: State is legislatively elected body, so presumably confident in representativeness.
* Legitimacy: Protect settled public expectations of 1st Amendment values upheld in public square, which don’t apply in private settings

*MARSH* RULE: FORMULATING TWO POSSIBLE APPROACHES TO DECIDING STATE ACTION

1. Public Use Standard – “The more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it.”

2. Public Function Test – “A private entity that owns all the property and controls all the municipal functions of an entire town is a state actor that must run the town in compliance with the Constitution.” (*Prager v. Google*’s description of Marsh’s holding).

* A facility that is built and operated primarily to benefit the public and whose operation is essentially a public function is a state actor for purposes of 1st/14th Amendment analysis.

*Marsh v. Alabama* (1946): **PRIVATELY OWNED COMPANY TOWN - LOOSENED DOCTRINE**

Importance: Right to free speech/access in company towns. The more publicly you open your land, the more subject to regulation. In balancing the interests of the Company as property owners, with the interests of the people in freedom of press and religion, the latter are more important.

Rule: The 1st and 14th Amendment protections of speech and religion still apply to individuals when operating in a privately-owned town if the town is open to the public and used for public purposes. Regardless of whether a corporation or municipality owns the town, the public it allows in has an identical interest in the town’s functionality and the freedom of communication within its borders.

Facts: Town of Chickasaw, Alabama was owned by a private corporation, Gulf Shipbuilding Company. With the exception of its private ownership, the town operated as any other and was bordered by and indistinguishable from surrounding municipalities. Marsh was a Jehovah’s Witness who stood on sidewalk distributing religious literature. Was told she could not distribute without a permit and that no permit would be issued to her. Protested, arrested, charged with violating Alabama state law. Argued that her activities were protected under 1st and 14th Amendments. District and circuit courts rejected because she was on private property (old rule of the state action doctrine).

Holding: A privately-owned town cannot deny traditional 1st and 14th Amendment protections of speech and religion to individuals because it is acting like a state. Alabama state statute that enforces the denial of these protections is in violation. Alabama cannot suspend people’s 1st and 14th Amendment rights while they are in the town because the Company has opened up the town to the public, and many residents from other surrounding areas frequently use the town for commercial purposes.

After *Marsh v. Alabama*, TWO BIG THINGS HAPPENED:

1. The sit-in movement—businesses started excluding patrons based on race, so civil rights protestors would take a seat at a diner counter and refuse to leave. Argument: even though it looked like only a private actor was excluding you, it was the state’s arbitrary exclusion laws that were allowing them to do it.
2. Civil Rights Act passed.

*Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner* TIGHTENED STATE ACTION DOCTRINE AGAIN

**NEW RULE**: Equal opportunity duties can limit private property if the private property is acting as a state does.

1. When this does happen—*Marsh v. Alabama* (company town); *State v. Shack*
2. When this doesn’t—*Lloyd Corp.* (malls).

HOW TO APPLY THE NEW RULE

1. Figure out which source of law you’re operating under
2. Figure out what the requirements are
   1. If you’re under federal Constitution—there must be a clear public square where you would not be able to get word out if that public square denied access or speech
   2. If you’re under state law—can be more expansive than the Constitution, so a place like a mall might apply (CA and NJ have granted free speech in shopping malls)

*Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner* (1972): **MALL - TIGHTENED DOCTRINE**

Importance: Malls are not company towns for purposes of free speech/access rights. Property does not lose its private character merely bc the public is invited to use it for designated purposes; size is not dispositive characteristic. Narrows *Marsh* to only apply to company town (unique/anachronistic historical phenomenon).

Rule: A private business may constitutionally exclude the distribution of handbills on its property when those handbills are completely unrelated to the business’ functions, and there are alternative means for distributors to relay the message.

Facts: Lloyd Corp. owned a large shopping mall. Area completely enclosed with landscaped “malls” running throughout. Tanner was a member of a group that quietly/orderly passed out handbills on one of the malls. Handbills invited members of general public to a meeting of the “Resistance Community” to protest the draft and the Vietnam War. A customer complained, and a guard told plaintiffs they would be arrested for trespassing if did not leave. Tanner filed suit arguing that shopping mall’s policies violated their First Amendment rights to distribute anti-war literature.

Holding: Malls are not company towns for purposes of free speech/access rights. Would stretch *Marsh* logic too far, since mall does not assume full spectrum of state/municipal powers/functions. *Marsh* involved the assumption that a private enterprise does have attributes of a state-created municipality and exercises semi-official municipal functions as a delegate of the state.

Dissent, Marshall: The mall is clearly equivalent to a public business district. Civic entities have access: there are doctors, dentists, lawyers, bankers, travel agents. Constitutional concern: moreover, for people who don’t have an easily accessible platform, hand-billing may be their only way to get the word out. Slippery slope worry – unless we adhere to *Marsh*, “only the wealthy may find effective communication possible”

Note: *Marsh* Public Function Test narrowly defined here under *Lloyd*, but can be read more broadly

*Prager v. Google* (N. Dist. Cal., 2018): **INTERNET**

Importance: *Lloyd*, post-*Marsh* demonstrates that *Marsh* reach is narrow.

Rule: Not a state actor obligated to uphold 1st Amendment protections under Marsh state action doctrine if not engaged in one of the “very few” public functions that have been traditionally “exclusively reserved to the State.”

Facts: Prager University sued Google/YouTube for censorship of its some of its politically conservative YouTube videos. YouTube placed some of the videos into “restricted mode,” which blocks the videos’ availability to YouTube users who voluntarily operate in that mode. Prager claimed the censorship was anti-conservative discrimination + that YouTube is like a company town in *Marsh*: performs traditional government functions.

Holding: *Marsh* cannot be extended to support Prager’s contention that YouTube should be treated as a state actor subject to 1st Amendment scrutiny, just bc it extends and operates its private property as a forum for expression of diverse viewpoints. Prager did not show that YouTube/Google engaged in any one of the “very few” public functions that have been traditionally “exclusively reserved to the State.”

**Public Trust Doctrine**

**CASES**: *Matthews v. Bay Head* (NJ 1984); *Juliana v. U.S.* (D. Or. 2016)

Three common law doctrines besides public trust to grant access rights to beaches by the general public:

* **Dedication**: gift of real property from private owner to public at large. Requires an offer by owner and acceptance by public. Must be made by some unequivocal act by the property owner giving clear evidence of an intent to dedicate the land to public use. (*Marsh v. Alabama).* But a longstanding acquiescence in use of beachfront property may constitute *implied* dedication
* **Prescription**: if public has used property possessed by another for a particular purpose for a long time, the public can acquire such rights permanently through prescriptive easement. (*Zuni Tribe v. Platt).*
* **Custom**: longstanding, uninterrupted, peaceable, reasonable, uniform use of beachfront by public for recreational uses confers continuing rights of access. Different from prescriptive easement bc of scale; looking at general habit as opposed to individuals or particular groups crossing.

PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE – Acknowledges that the ownership dominion and sovereignty over land flowed by tidal waters, which extend to the mean high watermark, is vested in the State in trust for the people. The public’s right to use the tidal lands and water encompasses navigation, fishing and recreational uses (bathing, swimming, and other shore activities).

Generally imposes 3 types of duties on a property subject to the trust:

1. Must be held available for use by the general public
2. Must not be sold
3. Must be maintained for particular types of uses

Application of the public trust doctrine to natural resources predates USA:

Justinian’s Institutes (Constantinople, 533) – “Wild animals, birds, and fish…as soon as they are caught by any one become at once the property of their captor by the law of nations; for natural reason admits the title of the first occupant to that which previously had no owner.” *Arnold v. Mundy,* NJ: Recognizes this doctrine carrying over. Oysters can be taken by anyone.

HISTORY OF PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE

* 19th century: Public trust lands were important to commerce, and the state wanted to keep the use open out of a concern about monopolies/fairness/equal access.
* “Public trust asset” within the public domain: Lands covered by tidal waters, wet-sand of the beach
* Theories of access working behind the scenes of public trust doctrine:
* Navigable waters serve **socially useful** purpose of promoting commerce
* **Custom** and **common law**: we’ve been doing it this way for awhile, developed **expectations** that this will continue. (Expectations of access. Connected to doctrines of adverse possession and prescription)
* Doctrine of **public accommodation**: you have been invited in, and thus your rights in some ways will constrain the rights of the property owner
* Like *Marsh v. Alabama*; *Logan Valley*; *State v. Shack*
* Like *INS v. AP*: certain kinds of property are at their most productive use if access by the public is unlimited
* Over time, the public trust doctrine was expanded in geographic scope
  1. Pre-*Avon, Illinois Central v. Illinois*, 1892: Land covered by tidal/navigable fresh waters (up to the mean high tide line) belonged to the people for fishing and navigation
  2. *Avon*: Public trust applied to municipally owned, dry sand beach immediately landward of high water mark, and extended public’s right to use the tidal lands to recreational uses. Three changes in finding for public rights:
     1. Includes the dry sand *and* foreshore
     2. Limitedly applies to **municipally owned** beaches
     3. Extended public’s right to use for the purposes of recreation, in addition to fishing and navigation.
  3. *Matthews*: Dry-sand of beaches owned by a non-profit charitable association. What about quasi-public organizations that are not municipalities?
* In cases where the public is denied reasonable access to the dry sand area and foreshore, quasi-public organizations must take on the responsibility to provide it.
  1. Ambient air, wild flora, fauna (*Robinson v. Penn. Pa.* 2013, footnote 10 in Juliana, 2016)
* States apply the doctrine differently: Some allow public access rights to be extinguished upon conveyance to private entity, others say the rights are inalienable.

Different approaches of courts in deciding whether to extend the trust:

* Does the resource share the same general features/functions as an existing public trust asset? (*Illinois Central,* 1892)
* Is the resource necessary for the enjoyment of an existing public trust asset and, when combined, creates a unique, irreplaceable resource that is in limited supply and yet currently operated by a non-profit charitable association that acts as a public entity but excludes the public? (*Matthews,* NJ 1972)
* Is resource something that has been enjoyed for ages without dispute and furthers general welfare? (*White v. Hughes*, 1939)

To decide if a court can enforce trust duties:

1. Is the property within the public domain and thus subject to public trust? Dif approaches by courts:
   1. *Illinois Central* approach
   2. *Matthews* approach
2. Has the entity violated one of the fiduciary duties of the trust?
3. Is the title owner an entity for which a court can enforce trust duties (to grant public right of access)?
   1. State government (*Illinois Central*)
   2. Municipal government (*Avon*)
   3. A quasi-public entity (*Matthews*)

(Court looks to whether the entity has assumed the shoes of a public organization; see Juliana for most recent iteration of public function test for purposes of state action analysis in First Amendment doctrine)

* 1. Federal government (*Juliana*)

*Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Illinois* (1892): **BEGINNING OF MODERN PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE**

“The ownership, dominion, and sovereignty over land flowed by tidal waters, which extend to the mean high water mark, is vested in the State in trust for the people.”

Importance: Seminal Supreme Court case on the public trust. The state will always have a right to revoke. Expanded public trust from just tidal waters to the land up to the average high water mark.

Rule: The state owns the land under navigable waters, and can only grant that land to a private party for purposes of enhancing navigation/public use.

Facts: Illinois legislature conveyed title to railroad for part of the submerged lands beneath Chicago harbor, with intent to give railroad control over the waters above the lands, against any future exercise of power over them by the state.

Justifications: **Constitutional** concern (people are sovereign and hold absolute right to all navigable waters for common use), **Policy** (railroad could have forever delayed improvement of the harbor and its nature is to deliver profits, not ensure public trust), **Necessity** for society to function properly (like *State v. Shack*; *Commonwealth v. Magadini*; *INS v. AP).*

*Matthews v. Bay Head* (NJ 1984): **EXTENDING PUBLIC TRUST TO NON-MUNICIPALITIES**

Importance: The public trust doctrine extends to dry beach area above the foreshore owned by a quasi-public entity. (Note: not extended to private property). Crucial factor is whether domain in question is essential to enjoying what already belongs to public.

Rule: If there is no reasonably satisfactory access to the dry sand area and foreshore for the public, then a non-municipal organization must provide it and take on some of the functions of a municipality. This is especially true if the organization already has a quasi-public role and takes on some of the functions of a municipality.

Facts: Bay Head Improvement Association (quasi-public entity) owned portions of the beach in Bay Head town. The wet sand was open to the public and the dry sand was not. Only Association members were allowed to use these portions of the beach during the day in summer. Association generally allowed only Bay Head residents to become members. Result: Bay Head nonresidents were generally not allowed to use these portions of the beach during summer. Also, bc there were no *public* beaches in Bay Head, nonresidents were generally prohibited from using the beach anywhere in town unless they knew a private beachfront owner.

Holding:

1. The public must be given access to and use of privately owned dry sand areas as reasonably necessary. In order for the public trust doctrine to be viable, public must be able to utilize the dry sand area of the beach in addition to the area covered by the ebb and flow of tide (foreshore).
2. Membership in the association must be open to the public at large to enroll in.

Note: Should the public trust doctrine be extended to the Bay Head Association?

* Based on nature of **organization**
  + It is basically a municipality itself
* Based on the nature of the **resource**
  + Efficiency: If scarce, who will maintain it?
  + Fairness: Might be unfair to deprive private owner, since beach could be established on other property

*Juliana v. U.S.* (D. Or. 2016):

Importance: Public trust doctrine applies to the federal government, in addition to the states.

Rule: Individuals have a fundamental constitutional right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life, which the federal government cannot fail to protect under the public trust doctrine.

Facts: Juliana and other teenagers brought suit against federal gov, alleging that the gov’s collective environmental policies caused global warming and rising of the seas, thereby violating fundamental due process rights and the public trust doctrine (bc of gov’s failure to protect the atmosphere, water, seas, seashores, and wildlife).

Holding: A claim that the federal government has affirmatively and substantially harmed a climate system capable of sustaining human life, in such a way that the system becomes unable to sustain human life, is cognizable. Territorial sea is public trust asset, atmosphere remains undecided.

Note: The natural resources trust operates according to basic trust principles, which impose upon the trustee a fiduciary duty to “protect the trust property against damage or destruction.” The government, as trustee, has a fiduciary duty to protect the trust assets from damage so that current and future trust beneficiaries will be able to enjoy the benefits of the trust.

**Unit Three:**

Power to Share

**Sharing Ownership In Space: Concurrent Tenancies**

**CASES**: *Olivas v. Olivas* (N.M. 1989), *Ark Land v. Harper* (W. Va. 2004)

Property law governs relationships between and among people. State law plays a large role in regulating these relationships. Doctrinal labels and categories have enormous real-world consequences CONCURRENT OWNERSHIP: More than one person may have the right to control the same thing at the same time.

TYPES OF COMMON LAW CONCURRENT TENANCIES

* Tenancy in common (default form of concurrent tenancy): Separate but undivided interests in the whole. 1 unity: Possession. Can transfer and encumber interest, file to terminate and divide, or bring action for petition.
* Joint tenancy: Outstanding characteristic is right of survivorship. Not descendible. 4 unities: Time, Title, Interest, Possession. (Some states have done away with this and allow joint tenancy simply by stating it. Can sever single share while others are still joint tenants.)
* Tenancy by the entirety (fewer than half of states): Only within marriage, parties are considered one. Neither party may unilaterally defeat right of survivorship of the other. Ends by mutual agreement or divorce. Requires the 4 unities + 5th unity: Marriage at time the property is acquired.

TYPES OF PARTITIONS

* **Partition**: Action to terminate co-tenancy and divide the property or its proceeds.
* **Partition in kind**: Physical division of the property amongst co-owners ordered by court.
* **Partition by sale**: If partition in kind is not feasible/appropriate, forced judicial sale with the cotenants dividing the proceeds in proportion to their ownership shares.
  + *Ark Land Co. v. Harper* (W. Va. 2004): A partition by sale is undesirable bc if one party opposes the sale, the receipt of cash proceeds is not always fair compensation for the loss of property. Thus, law of ALL jurisdictions reflects a **presumption towards partition in kind**, only resorting to partition by sale where partition in kind is inconvenient.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CONCURRENT TENANCIES** | | | |
|  | **TENANCY IN COMMON** | **JOINT TENANCY** | **TENANCY BY THE ENTIRETY** |
| CREATION | Usually default. | Usually specific. | Only for married couples. |
| RIGHT OF POSSESSION | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| DUTY TO PAY RENT | Not, unless ouster | No, unless ouster | No, unless ouster |
| RIGHT TO PROFITS | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| DUTY TO PAY COSTS | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| RIGHT TO UNILATERAL TRANSFER | Yes | Yes; a joint tenant who sells severs the joint tenancy between selling owner and remaining owners. | No |
| RIGHT TO UNILATERALLY ENCUMBER | Yes | Yes; in most states, an encumbrance will not survive the death of the encumbering co-tenant. | In most states, spouses cannot encumber their interest in property held by the entirety without each other’s consent, and creditors cannot attach property held through tenancy by the entity to satisfy debts of one of the spouses. |
| RIGHT OF SURVIVORSHIP | No | Yes; a joint tenant who transfers property destroys RoS of fellow owners with respect to share. | Yes |
| RIGHT TO TERMINATE | Yes | Yes | No; only on divorce or death. |

*Olivas v. Olivas* (N.M. 1989): **DUTY TO PAY RENT**

Rule: Although a divorced spouse forced to move out of the marital residence may be entitled to rent from the remaining spouse under the doctrine of constructive ouster, this will not be the case where the departing spouse chose on his own to move out and thus contributed to the divorce. On the contrary, the remaining spouse will be liable for rent only if the realities of the situation, without there being any fault by either co-tenant, prevent the co-tenants from sharing occupancy; i.e. the parties cannot be expected to live together reasonably on the property and they come to a mutual agreement that one of them has to move out.

Facts: Sam (P) and Carolina (D) Olivas divorced. Had held their property as tenants in common, but about two months before the divorce, Sam chose to move out of their house and Carolina remained in possession. Sam brought an action for rent, claiming that he was constructively ousted from the house.

Holding: There is not only evidence that Sam chose to move out and that his move was one of the reasons Carolina filed for divorce, but also that upon moving out, Sam moved in with a girlfriend. Therefore, Sam has not carried his burden in proving that there has been a constructive ouster. Rather, he chose on his own to move out and possibly even created the impetus for divorce. Sam is not entitled to rent.

*Ark Land v. Harper* (W. Va. 2004): **RIGHT TO JUDICIAL PARTITION**

Rule: Previously, this court has ordered partition by sale only where: (1) partition in kind is not convenient; (2) the sale will result in the promotion of at least one of the parties’ interests; and (3) the sale will not prejudice the interests of the other parties. The economic value of property is not the decisive factor in determining whether to partition in kind or by sale. Other relevant factors include longstanding family ownership & sentimental/emotional interests.

Facts: Caudill family owned property exclusively for 1oo years, and sold a portion to Ark Land Co. Since Ark wanted to extract the coal from entire property, wanted to purchase the remainder of the property, but Caudill’s declined. Ark filed suit seeking to partition and sell the property. Caudill’s sought a partition in kind and presented expert testimony that the property was capable of being partitioned in kind. However, Ark presented expert’s testimony suggesting that the partition in kind would cause an increase in several million dollars in mining costs.

Holding: Partition in kind ordered. While this court recognizes the resulting economic burden on Ark Land, it does not justify the sale of the Caudills’ ancestral family home. Caudill family owned the property for over 100 years; uninterested in land’s monetary value; sought only to maintain family ownership of property. This non-economic interest would be prejudiced if land is partitioned by sale. Though partition in kind would add costs to Ark Land’s mining plans, economic hardship is not sole factor to consider.

Concurrence: Right test, but improperly applied. Partition by sale bc Caudill’s interest in the property does not outweigh the great economic burden Ark will have to endure.

**Marital Property (Spouses and Unmarried Partners)**

**CASES**: *O’Brien v. O’Brien* (NY 1985), *Watts v. Watts* (Wisc. 1987)

HISTORY

Pre-1800s English Common Law: Coverture

* After marriage, wife's identity dissolves and merges with the husband.
* Exception for some control for the W: trust, antenuptial agreement

Traditional treatment of property interest upon death of a spouse (still available in some states)

* Dower interest for W: upon death of H, she has 1/3 life estate in the H’s land: this interest is inalienable without her consent
* Curtesy interest for H: life estate in all the lands in which his wife owned a present freehold estate during the marriage and that was inheritable by issue of the couple, but only if the couple had a child

Mid-1800s: Married Women’s Property Acts

* Abolition of Coverture: restores married woman to the same position as single women under common law
* Woman gains rights over her separate property
* Failed to recognize joint property: women still had no title to the H’s property

Mid-1800s: Separate Property Regimes

1960s: Equitable Divorce – Marital Property

Early 2000s: Same-Sex Marriage

SEPARATE VS. COMMUNAL PROPERTY SYSTEMS

Separate Property (Majority Rule, 41 states)

* **Marriage**: all property is earned and kept separately.
* **Divorce**: equitable distribution of property owned by each party on divorce based on a variety of factors (economic need, status, contributions of the respective parties)
* **Death**: Many states provide for a forced share of the decedent’s estate, effectively overriding the will to give the widow(er) 1/3 to ½ of the estate

Community Property (Minority Rule, 9 states)

* **Marriage**: Spouses retain their property held prior to marriage separately but jointly own property acquired during the marriage
* **Divorce**: Most community property states adopt the equitable distribution principle but a few give each spouse their separate property and half of the joint property
* **Death**: A spouse may dispose of their separate property and half of the joint property by will; one half of joint property mechanically goes to spouse

*O’Brien v. O’Brien* (NY 1985): **DEFINING “MARITAL PROPERTY”**

Importance: License acquired during marriage is marital property subject to equitable distribution. OUTLIER: no other state high court has ruled that a license is property.

Rule: Marital property is subject to equitable distribution. It is property acquired by either spouse during the marriage regardless of the form in which title is held. In making an equitable distribution of marital property, the court considers any direct or indirect contribution to the acquisition of the property.

Facts: Mr. (P) and Mrs. (D) O’Brien got married and P enrolled in medical school. To pay for joint living expenses, D put her education on hold, got a job, contributed all of her earnings to joint living expenses, maintained household. After P received his medical license he filed for divorce. Together, their only asset of any value was P’s license. In the divorce proceeding, the trial court awarded D part of the estimated value of the medical license.

Holding: A license acquired during marriage is marital property subject to equitable distribution under NY statute Domestic Relations Law 236(b)(5) bc it is a thing of value (interest in a professional career potential) arising out of marital relationship (direct or indirect contributions of non-title holding spouse). Here, most of the marriage was devoted to P getting his license and D played a major role in that effort. Her contributions represent investments in their partnership and the license is a product of the parties’ joint efforts, so should be considered marital property.

Reasoning:

* **Textual**: NY statute Domestic Relations Law 236(b)(5) directly says that contributions of one spouse to other’s career represents investments in economic partnership.
* **History/purpose** behind statute: Statute was an attempt to replace existing system with equitable distribution of marital property, based on the premise that marriage is an economic partnership to which both parties contribute.
* **Locke**: Your labor is your property. Working spouses make great sacrifices and forgo the acquisition of marital assets that could have been accumulated if the professional spouse had been employed, rather than occupied with the study and training necessary to acquire a professional license.

Concurrence: A professional in training who is not finally committed to a career choice when the distributive award is made may be locked into a particular kind of practice simply because the monetary obligations imposed by the distributive award made by the court. The equitable distributions of the law were intended to provide flexibility.

*Watts v. Watts* (Wisc. 1987): **UNMARRIED PARTNERS**

Rule: Unmarried cohabitants may each be entitled to a share of the wealth jointly accumulated during the cohabitation.

Facts: Sue and James Watts began living together in a marriage-like relationship. Sue assumed James’ surname; so did the two children they had together; Sue was on James’ insurance policy. Sue provided childcare and homemaking services, eventually worked part-time at his office. After 12 years together, she moved out and ended relationship. James barred her from returning to work. Sue asserts that her contributions increased their business and personal wealth, that they had a contract to share equally the property accumulated during their relationship, that James breached when refused to share equally the wealth accumulated through their joint efforts.

Holding: Sue has pleaded sufficient facts to state a cause of action for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and partition.

* Because there was separate consideration beyond an illicit sexual relationship, a contract claim can go forward
  + There is no evidence that the legislature intended for the provisions of the Family Code dedicated to property division after marriage to apply to unmarried cohabiting couples. But, unmarried cohabitants are free to enter contracts with one another, and the contract will not be unenforceable on the basis of public policy so long as there was some consideration other than sexual activity.
* Because denying her a share in their assets would be manifestly unjust under the circumstances, the plaintiff should be allowed to pursue a quasi-contract claim.
  + A claim for unjust enrichment may be proper when (1) a benefit is conferred on a party, with (2) knowledge or appreciation of the benefit, and (3) the party unjustly accepts or retains the benefit. Unmarried cohabitants may properly bring a claim for unjust enrichment based on benefits conferred during the relationship.
  + Public policy: Refusing to allow such marriage-like claims would allow one equally guilty party to keep all assets and property acquired during the relationship, which is plainly inequitable.
* There is a cognizable claim for partition. When parties act jointly financially and socially while living together, it is strong evidence that they intended to share property equally.

Note:

* This court rejects approach of Illinois Supreme Court in *Hewitt v. Hewitt* (1979), refusing to give judicial recognition to illegal/immoral nonmarital relationships by extending property and contract rights to cohabiting couples. Wisconsin has decriminalized nonmarital cohabitation, so its laws are distinguishable from Illinois’s.

DOCTRINES OF ESTATE SYSTEMS

1. **Presumption Against Forfeiture** (*Edwards v. Bradley*) - reluctance to recognize future interests
2. **Doctrine Against Waste** (*McIntyre*) - seeks to mediate conflicts between the interests of life tenants and interests of future interest holders by preventing present possessory owners from unreasonably damaging the estate
3. **Rule Against Creation of New Estates** (*Johnson*) - Prohibits owners from creating ownership packages that do not fit within one of the established estates. People cannot create new kinds of estates. The list we have (fee simple, life estate etc.) is the list available to grantors. Courts will re-write wills, ignore the grantor’s intent in order to preserve the status quo.
   1. An estate must fit into one of the established estate categories. Language in a conveyance will be interpreted to fit into one of the established estate categories. (*Johnson v. Whiton*)
   2. If the placement of a condition would render a future interest void, the future interest created will be interpreted to be of a type that validly embraces the condition (*Edwards*)
4. **Rule Against Racial Restrictions** (*Shelley, Evans v. Abney*) - Covenants restraining the ownership, use, or enjoyment of land by racial and ethnic minorities are prohibited. *Evans* suggests that this should be applied only in circumstances where there is clear disparate treatment
5. **Rule Against Restraints on Alienation** (*Serio, Woodside*) - Restraints on Marriage: If a condition is designed to support a spouse until he or she remarries, then it is valid. If the condition is not so designed, it is invalid under the rule.

* Absolute restraint? Void. An absolute restraint on alienation is “repugnant” to the nature of a “fee simple” interest in real property. (*Serio*)
* Partial restraint? Reasonableness test. Reasonableness is determined by “weighing the utility of the restraint against the injurious consequences of enforcing the restraint.” (*Woodside*)

1. **Rule Against Perpetuities** - “No interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, no later than 21 years after the death of some life in being at the creation of the interest.”
2. **Doctrine of Waste** – seeks to mediate conflicts by preventing present possessory owners from unreasonably damaging estate

TERMS

**Future Interest:** The right to take possession in the future under specified circumstances.

1. Future interests exist at the moment they are created, though the holder of a future interest as no right to **possess** the property until the triggering event occurs;
2. Transfer of possession may be certain or continent on the occurrence of certain events.

**Devisees:** those entitled to real property under a will

**Heirs:** those entitled by law to inherit the property if the owner dies **intestate** (without a will)

1. If no relatives qualify as heirs, the property will **escheat** to the state.

**Trust:** a legal arrangement in which one person or entity holds title to property for the benefit of another.

CONTEMPORARY ESTATES SYSTEM

**Fee simple estate**: present estate, could potentially last forever—there are 4 fee simple estates:

1. *Fee simple absolute*: a fee simple without an associated future interest.

* Language: (1) O to A, (2) O to A and her heirs (3) O to A in fee simple;
* Form of **absolute ownership** – full bundle of rights of property ownership. If A dies intestate (with no will), property goes to heirs (or gov’t if no heirs).
* **One cannot create a condition totally prohibiting/restricting the alienability of a fee simple estate, or requiring a forfeiture upon alienation *(Edwards)*.**

1. *Fee simple determinable*: A type of defeasible fee where the future interest reverts automatically to the grantor on the happening of a stated event.

* Describes the interest with *words of duration*: O to A “as long as used for”/ “during” used for specific purpose
* The future interest is called a “**possibility of reverter**.”
* If condition violated, ownership *automatically* shifts to O/heirs/devisees. The language need not explicitly state the possibility of reverter.

1. *Fee simple subject to condition subsequent*: A type of defeasible fee in which the grantor may choose to retain for herself or her heirs the right to decide, at the time a specified condition is violated, whether to retake the property.

* Language (uses words of *condition):* “on condition that”; “provided that”; “but if used for [another] purpose…shall have right to terminate”.
* The future interest is called **right of entry**
* Interest does not automatically shift back to grantor; grantor must assert the right
* If grantor fails to assert right of entry after condition is satisfied, **doctrine of** **laches** may prevent the holder of the right of entry from waiting too long to assert her right of entry; laches prevents recovery when an unreasonable delay in asserting legal rights unfairly prejudices another.

1. *Fee simple subject to executory interest*: When the future interest in a defeasible fee belongs to someone other than the grantor, the present interest is called a fee simple subject to executory limitation.

* Language: O to A “so long as used for residential purposes, then to B”
* Future interest is called an **executory interest**
* O to A so long as used for residential purposes, then to B (but this violates the rule against perpetuities because B’s executory interest could vest too far into future).

**Life estate**: A conveyance designating a present ownership to a grantee for the duration of his lifetime.

* Future interest: If FI goes to grantor - *reversion*. If FI goes to 3rd party – *remainder*.

**Term of years**: Any estate limited by specific period of time (not lifetime/event). A lease lasting for more than 1 year is term of years.

* *[Fee tail* – “to A and the heirs of his body” – i.e. son to son to son - most states no longer recognize: either fee simple or life estate with remainder in A’s heirs]

HIERARCHY OF PREFERENCES IN ESTATES (if there is language ambiguity re: type of estate. Hierarchy tracks the presumption against forfeitures.)

1. **Fee Simple Absolute**
2. **Covenant** (Must have a benefitted/burdened estate, unless in gross to government, charity, HOA)
3. **Fee Simple Subject to a Condition Subsequent** (If it is ambiguous as to whether a conveyance creates a fee simple determinable or fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, the presumption against forfeitures leads courts to prefer the latter. This is because, unlike with a fee simple determinable, reversion is not automatic.)
4. **Fee Simple Determinable**

INTERPRETIVE RULES

**One cannot grant more than one has**—if you have a Life Estate with reversion to grantor, you cannot grant a fee simple absolute

**Honor Grantor’s Intent**—Readthe plain language of the deed, considered as a whole, to determine the intent of the parties. The language must “clearly state the grantor’s intent to create a discretionary power to terminate” *(Wood)*

* Assume that if draftsmen wanted to create a certain present estate with a future interest, would have used the required terminology (*Edwards*)

**Presumption against forfeitures**—If it is possible to interpret the language in a conveyance to avoid loss of the property by the current owner, courts will generally adopt this interpretation;

* “It is a well-settled rule that conditions tending to destroy estates, such as conditions subsequent, are not favored in law. They are strictly construed.” (*Wood)*

TREATMENT OF PRECATORY LANGUAGE

1. When conveyances include language explaining the purpose of the transfer, the vast majority of courts will hold the language to be precatory – not intended to have any legal significance – and will interpret the conveyance to have transferred all the interests the grantor owned.
2. Follows from the presumption against forfeitures.

JUSTIFICATION OF INTERPRETIVE RULES

1. **Efficiency:** Property should be able to shift to its most valuable, productive, or desired use over time;

* Enforcing the interests of a grantor over a current owner facilitates **dead hand control** of an estate, which operates to the detriment of alienability and economic efficiency
* It also risks **concentrating ownership** in the hands of certain groups to the exclusion of others, perpetuating distributive injustice. The above interpretive rules grant current owners greater freedom to alter land uses as economic and social conditions change
* **Counterargument:** one could argue that future interests may promote alienability and efficiency in some circumstances, as they make grantors more willing to part with their property if they can control who owns it or how it is sued in the future.

1. **Administrability:** Strict formal requirements for the creation of future interests are easier to administer by courts;
2. **Fairness:** Granting ability to create future interests a reward for labor. But is it fair to restrict the right of the current owner, who’s more recent labor has engendered an expectation interest in being able to use the property for whatever purposes the current owner sees as most beneficial?

* While most courts are reluctant to find a future interest in the absence of clear language creating one, *some courts are eager to find a future interest when the property is donated for charitable purposes*.

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON ADVERSE POSSESSION CLAIMS OVER FUTURE INTERESTS

1. The **statute of limitations on a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent** only starts to run from the moment the grantor exercises his or her right to re-entry;
2. The **statute of limitations starts to run on a fee simple determinable** from the moment the condition is violated.

CONTINGENT AND VESTED REMAINDERS

**Contingent:** Remainders are contingent if (1) the remainder will take effect only upon the happening of an event that is not certain to happen, or (2) if the remainder will go to a person who cannot be ascertained at the time of the initial conveyance.

* Example of a **class gift**: “O to A for life, then to the children of B.” Contingent remainder in the children of B if B has no children upon the conveyance from O to A, because the children cannot be individually identified.
* May be destroyed if contingency does not occur

**Vested:** Remainders to persons who are identifiable at the time of the initial conveyance and for whom no conditions must occur before the future interest becomes possessory, other than the death of the life estate tenant.

* **Absolutely Vested:** O to A for life, then to B
* **Vested Remainders Subject to Open:** Remainder that is vested in some individuals but may be divided with others who join the class in the future – e.g. in a class gift when some children are born but others might be born in the future;
* **Vested Remainders Subject to Divestment:** A vested remainder that may be lost due to an event that occurs after the original conveyance –e.g. O to A for life, then to B, but if B marries a lawyer, the property shall then revert to O. If B marries lawyer B loses right to obtain property after death of A

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **VESTED REMAINDERS** | | | |
| **Type** | **Conditions** | | |
| **Indefeasibly Vested** | Created in an ascertained or born person | AND not subject to a condition precedent other than the natural termination of the preceding possessory estate | AND no possibility of dilution, i.e. no opening up to other recipients |
| **Vested Subject to Open** | AND the remainder belongs to a class of recipients that could potentially expand in the future |
| **Vested Subject to Divestment** | AND the remainder could be completely prevented from becoming possessory |

*Edwards v. Bradley* (Va. 1984): **PRESUMPTION AGAINST FORFEITURE; FEE SIMPLE V. LIFE ESTATE**

Rule: Forfeiture restraints are valid as to life estates, but not to fee simple estates. You cannot create a condition prohibiting the alienation of a vested fee simple estate. So it must be a life estate, which may include conditional limitations.

Facts: Grantor places three conditions on conveyance to spendthrift daughter: 1) can’t encumber, 2) can’t convey (restraint on alienation), 3) can’t burden with debt. If conditions violated, remainder to grantee’s children. Grantee dies, but wants to devise estate to all but one of her children. Child left out sues to enforce the life estate with remainder to children. Other child claims it was fee simple subject to conditional limitation which, because the condition was not violated, could be devised as grantee chose.

Holding: In the absence of language clearly creating a specific type of ownership, a will placing forfeiture restraints on an interest in land creates a life estate, not a fee simple. Such restraints on alienation are void in a fee simple estate, so when they are placed on property in a will, a life estate is created in order to preserve the conditions. This will promote the grantor’s intent to effectuate an enforceable restraint on alienation. Lilliston will created a life estate in Jones. Thus, Jones, upon her death, had no interest in the farm and her divestiture to only five of her six children was invalid. The farm passed automatically to all of her children equally, including Bradley.

*McIntyre v. Scarbrough* (Ga. 1996): **DOCTRINE AGAINST WASTE; LIFE ESTATE**

Rule: A life estate can be terminated because of tenant’s waste. A life tenant has full use and enjoyment of property as long as she exercises ordinary care to preserve and protect the property (does not commit waste). Otherwise, tenant forfeits her life estate. Failure to pay property taxes generally constitutes waste bc the land may have to be sold to raise proceeds needed to pay the taxes.

Facts: McIntyre sold a large tract of land to Scarbrough but reserved a life estate in 1.2 acres of that land. McIntyre was responsible for maintaining the land and the home on it, and for paying certain taxes. However, from 1990-94, McIntyre failed to pay taxes and there was testimony home was unoccupied for awhile, fell into disrepair. S petitioned to terminate M’s life estate bc of waste. McIntyre was 90 years old and not living on the subject premises because of illness. Claimed she intended to return.

Holding: Since McIntyre failed to pay the taxes, an obligation which was an express condition of the initial sale, had committed waste.

Dissent: This court has previously held that forfeiture can happen only if there is both permissive and active waste, particularly when, as here, the tenant’s waste is unintentional or due to the tenant’s hardship or other inability to maintain the land. Here, McIntyre is now 90 years old and in bad health. Her grandson apparently had undertaken some repairs. These facts at least raise a triable issue of fact regarding whether McIntyre’s neglect was voluntary.

**The Estates System: Restrictions on an Owner’s Power to Transfer**

**CASES**: *Evans v. Abney* (1970), *Johnson v. Whiton* (Mass. 1893), *Northwest v. Serio* (Md. 1929), *Woodside Village v. Jahren* (Fla. 2002), *Shelley v. Kramer* (1948) - Rule Against Racial Restrictions

*Evans v. Abney* (1970): **CY PRES AND CHARITABLE TRUSTS; RULE AGAINST RACIAL RESTRICTIONS**

Importance: Intent if purpose deemed impractical

Rule: The interpretation of trusts and wills, and application of the cy pres doctrine, is governed by state law.

Facts: Senator Bacon willed a park to the city of Macon, GA with the restriction that the park was for whites only. However, Bacon’s intentions could not be fulfilled bc of *Evans v. Newton* (U.S. 1966), which held that the continued operation of the park must be without racial discrimination.

Holding: Since Bacon’s sole intent was for the park to be for white people, there is no way that the language of the will can be changed while still effectuating its purpose. The trust is voided and the land will revert to Bacon’s heirs.

Dissent, Douglas: Returning the property to Senator’s heirs will not necessarily achieve the racial segregation that Senator desired. When any buildings are constructed on that land, minorities must be allowed inside. There is no constitutional way to assure this property will not be used by black people. Trust terminated. Lower court effectuated the terms of the will as near as possible to its explicit terms, which the court interpreted to be a preference for termination of the park rather than its integration.

Dissent, Brennan: Shelley holds that when parties of different races want to deal with one another, a state court cannot prevent it by enforcing a private scheme of racial discrimination. As far as the record shows, this is a case of a state court enforcing a racial restriction to prevent willing parties from dealing with one another, and thus denying equal protection.

*Johnson v. Whiton* (Mass. 1893): **RULE AGAINST CREATION OF NEW ESTATES**

Importance: Qualified fee simple

Rule: A land conveyance that does not directly qualify as one of the existing types of inheritance will be interpreted to create the most similar estate.

Facts: Royal Whiton willed 1/3 of his estate to his granddaughter Sarah Whiton “and her heirs on her father’s side,” and the rest to his other grandchildren. Whiton tried to convey the land willed to her but it was refused because she could not convey a fee simple absolute under the interest willed to her.

Holding: A conveyor of land may not create new types of inheritance. When a conveyance attempts to do this, the court will construe the conveyance as in the most similar established type of estate. In Royal Whiton’s will, he devised one third of his estate to Sarah Whiton and her heirs on her father’s side. This is an unrecognized kind of inheritance. The words “on her father’s side” are rejected, leaving Sarah Whiton with a fee simple estate that she is entitled to convey. Court rewrites the will; fee simple absolute.

Notes: Words of limit (“for life”) vs. words of purchase (“to A”)

*Northwest v. Serio* (Md. 1929): **RULE AGAINST RESTRAINTS ON ALIENATION**

Rule: A clause in a fee simple deed requiring grantor consent to transfer the property is generally invalid as repugnant to the estate.

Facts: Northwest conveyed land to the grantee in fee simple, with a provision that grantees could not sell the property for a certain period of time without Northwest’s consent. Subsequently, grantees contracted to sell the lot to Serios. When Northwest did not consent to the sale, Serios brought suit for specific performance of their sale agreement on the grounds that the grantor consent clause in the original deed was invalid.

Holding: Grantor consent clauses in deeds are generally void as invalid restraints against alienation. In this case, the clause in the deed from Northwest that prohibited the grantees from selling the property for a certain period of time without Northwest’s consent is invalid because it improperly restricts the transferability of the property.

Dissent: The purpose of the grantor consent clause in the deed is to give Northwest the power to control the character of its development for a certain period of time. This is reasonable in light of developer’s interest in securing a return on its investment and the public’s interest in allowing venture capitalist developers such as Northwest to commonly develop a residential area.

*Woodside Village v. Jahren* (Fla. 2002): **RULE AGAINST RESTRAINTS ON ALIENATION**

Importance: Condos are essentially different from other forms of property (live in close proximity, common facilities, have form of governance that is essentially a “democratic sub-society.”), and are thus generally entitled to a greater degree of control over the condo owners’ property uses.

Rule: Amendments to a declaration of condominium are valid if they are reasonable and do not violate public policy or the condo owners’ constitutional rights.

Facts: Woodside Village is a condo development governed by the Declaration of Condominium of Woodside Village. Declaration contained restrictions on leases, as well as a provision allowing amendment of Declaration, and was amended to further inhibit leases, limiting them to no more than 9 months. Condo owners in Woodside all purchased their condos subject to the Declaration and as a result, notice that the Declaration was subject to amendment. Year after the amendment passed, Jahren was engaged in a lease for more than nine months, but did not terminate it when notified that he was required to comply with amendment.

Holding: The amendment is valid and enforceable, in line with historical treatment of condo restrictions. Jahren was on notice that Declaration could be amended at any time and that he would be subject to such amendments; the amendment is not arbitrary, furthers Woodside’s desire for stability in the community and continuity of residence.

Concurrence: The majority was correct in its findings that the amendment is valid. However, the amendment has deprived Jahren of a strong benefit in his property that existed when he purchased it. The Legislature should consider placing restrictions on condominiums’ ability to change the rights of existing unit owners by amending their bylaws.

Notes: Legislature later overruled *Woodside* to say that amendments to a declaration do not restrain buyers who purchase condominium before the amendment passes

*Shelley v. Kramer* (1948): **RULE AGAINST RACIAL RESTRICTIONS**

Importance: Traditional covenant doctrine, Rule Against Unreasonable Restraints on Alienation, Rule Against Perpetuities, Fourteenth Amendment: State Action Doctrine

Rule: State court enforcement of racially restrictive covenants constitutes state action, which violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (which guarantees equal treatment of all people under the law, including in their exercise of various property rights). Restrictive covenants that discriminate solely on the basis of race would be invalid on equal protection grounds if created by a state or local law.

Facts: 1911, 30 property owners on a Missouri street signed/recorded a restrictive covenant, providing that no races other than Caucasians allowed as tenants on property for next 50 yrs. In 1945, Shelleys (black) bought a house on one of the restricted parcels without knowledge of restrictive covenant. Kraemers + other white property owners brought suit to enforce covenant, seeking to enjoin Shelleys from taking possession and divest them of title. Case was consolidated with similar Michigan case before Supreme Court, here determining whether Equal Protection Clause prohibits a state's courts from enforcing racially restrictive covenants.

Holding: Agreements alone cannot be regarded as violation of 14th A rights because no state action. However, court enforcement of the covenant constituted a state action to deprive petitioners of 14th A rights. [The issue here is whether state court enforcement of racially restrictive covenants entered into by private actors constitutes state action. 14th A does not apply to purely private discrimination, so ppl are free to enter into / voluntarily abide by racially restrictive covenants. Nevertheless, the actions of state courts are state actions within meaning of 14th A; court is an improper state actor when it enforces a substantive rule that violates individual rights under 14th A. \*In this case, state court enforcement of the restrictive covenants against the Shelleys would deny them equal protection in the exercise of their property rights. States may not make available the full coercive power of government to allow private individuals to deny the Shelleys’ rights on the basis of race. Judicial enforcement of the racially restrictive covenants violated the Equal Protection Clause, so the rulings of the state courts are reversed.]

*Vasquez v. Glassboro* (N.J. 1980): **DISTINGUISHING TENANCIES FROM OTHER RELATIONSHIPS**

Rule: A farm-labor service must use judicial proceedings to evict a farmworker who remains in possession of his living quarters after the termination of his employment. A landlord may not use self-help to evict someone who is legally in possession of his property, even if they are not a tenant protected with guaranteed summary action. Judicial summary process provides an equitable, quick resolution to the dispute that is suitable to both parties.

Facts: Farmers contracted with Glassboro nonprofit for services of migrant farm laborers from Puerto Rico, operated a labor camp in NJ where housed migrant-worker employees with barracks, common facilities, no real privacy. Contracts did not require the workers to pay to live in the camps and provided that if a worker was fired, Glassboro would not provide for their transportation back to Puerto Rico. Vasquez was fired. Though there was still an open bed, Glassboro did not allow Vasquez to remain overnight. Farmworkers Rights Project filed a complaint on Vasquez’s behalf, seeking an order permitting Vasquez to reenter the barracks and an injunction prohibiting Glassboro from denying Vasquez use of the barracks except through judicial process. Court considered recurring question of whether migrant farmworkers should be evicted through a judicial proceeding rather than through a landlord's exercise of self-help.

Holding: Migrant workers staying at Glassboro's barracks are not tenants of Glassboro: have no privacy, their occupancy is sporadic, no contract requiring rent. As a result, they are not afforded statutory protection against self-help evictions because traditionally, only tenants have been entitled to a guaranteed summary action. However, the employment contract between Glassboro and Vasquez was unconscionable, as it did not provide Vasquez with any time to find alternative housing. On public-policy grounds, a resolution not involving the contract is necessary.

*Sommer v. Kridel* (NJ 1977): **DUTY TO MITIGATE UNPAID RENT**

Rule: A landlord has a duty to mitigate damages when he seeks to recover rents due from a defaulting tenant.

Facts: Kridel entered into a two-year lease with Sommer from May 1, 1972 – April 30, 1974. About two weeks after the lease began, Kridel wrote to Sommer stating that his position had substantially changed, that he can no longer continue the lease, and that Sommer can keep the two months’ rent already paid – Sommer never replied. A third party approached Sommer about renting the apartment but Sommer told her that it was occupied, even though he knew it wasn’t. Eventually, in 1973 Sommer re-let the apartment but sued Kridel first. The trial court ruled in favor of Kridel, even though the prevailing rule at the time stated that there was not duty on the part of Sommer to mitigate damages.

Holding: A landlord has a duty to mitigate damages by making a reasonable effort to re-let the premises when seeking to recover rent from a defaulting tenant. Such a duty is consistent with basic justice and fairness. There is an increasing trend to treat leases not as conveyances of land, but as contracts. As a result, application of the contract doctrine of mitigation of damages is appropriate. If a landlord fails to mitigate damages when he has the opportunity, the defaulting tenant may be relieved of his duty to pay rent. In this case, a third party was ready, willing, and able to rent Kridel’s apartment and asked specifically about it. This actually made Sommer’s duty to mitigate damages very easy as it would have taken little to no effort to re-let the apartment. But Sommer told the third party the apartment was not available, thus failing in his duty.

*Javins v. First Nat’l Realty* (D.C. 1970): **RIGHT TO A HABITABLE PREMISE**

Rule: An implied warranty of habitability is read into residential leases and breach of that warranty frees tenants from the obligation to pay rent.

Facts: Two ppl rented apartments in the same building from First National Realty. They each withheld rent from FNR due to numerous violations of the housing code, which not arise until after leases began. FNR sought ejectment bc of failure to pay rent.

Holding: A warranty of habitability (measured by the standards set out in the Housing Regulations for DC) is implied in residential leases and it requires landlords to maintain residential premises in livable condition. If the landlord does not maintain the premises, the tenant is deprived of all value for which he contracted, and breach of this warranty gives rise to the usual remedies for breach of contract. A landlord’s requirement to maintain the premises in livable condition is consistent with contract principles that are increasingly being applied to leases. Although courts have historically not held landlords liable for repairs, the nature of leases has changed and those precedents are outdated.

Note:

* J. Wright, 1984: “I was indeed influenced by the fact…most of the tenants in Washington, D.C. slums were poor and black and most of the landlords were rich and white. I didn’t like what I saw, and I did what I could to ameliorate, if not eliminate, the injustice involved in the way many of the poor were required to live in the nation’s capital. I offer no apology for not following more closely the legal precedents which had cooperated in creating the conditions that I found unjust.”

*3000 B.C. v. Bowman* (Pa. 2008): **COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**

Rule: A covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every lease. A landlord violates tenant’s implied right of quiet enjoyment of premises if landlord’s conduct substantially and fundamentally impairs the utility of the premises for the tenant, amounting to a constructive eviction, for which damages may be awarded. In awarding damages, the court treats this like a contract action: seeks to put the non-breaching party in the financial position it would have been in had the contract been fulfilled and not breached (can include lost profits of a business, attorney’s fees, additional rent, reputation cost).

Facts: 3000 B.C. operated a spa and required a peaceful and quiet environment for its successful operation. Rented spa space from Bowman Properties for 12 years, after which Bowman began renting the apt above to a barber shop. Construction and resulting noise from the barber shop harmed spa’s business, which suffered financial loss and eventually moved to another location mid-lease. Sued for breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.

Holding: This is a constructive eviction. Bowman breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in its lease with 3000 B.C. It knew that the utility of the leased space was based on quiet tranquility. Its lease of the apt above substantially and fundamentally impaired the utility of the premises, and constituted a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. In seeking to put 3000 B.C. in the position it would have been in absent breach, court awards damages for period beginning when construction started and ending at the termination of the lease: lost profits, moving expenses, spa credits paid out to customers for ruined sessions, and loss of business goodwill. Court declines to award damages for speculative repeated renewals of the lease.

**Regulating Access To Rental Properties:**

**Fair Housing Law & Discrimination On The Basis Of Race, Sex, Familial Status, Sexual Orientation**

**CASES**: *Fair Housing Council v. Roommate.com* (9th Cir. 2012), *Human Rights Commission v. LaBrie* (Vt. 1995), *Sprague v. City of Madison* (1996)

SOURCES OF FAIR HOUSING LAW

1. Fair Housing Act of 1968 – prohibits discrimination on the basis of "race, color, sex, familial status, or national origin" with respect to the rental or sale of a "dwelling." Defines "dwelling" as "any building, structure, or portion thereof which is occupied as, or designed or intended for occupancy as, a residence by one or more families."
2. State & City Ordinances Modeled after FHA
3. Madison General Ordinance (*Sprague*)
4. Vermont Fair Housing Act (*LaBrie*)
5. Civil Rights Act of 1866 – Section 1982 (“All citizens of the United States shall have the same right....as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold and convey real and personal property”)
6. Civil Rights Act of 1964 – Section 2000(d) “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”

FROM COMMON LAW LIMITS TO STATUTORY LAW

* Fair Housing law refers to the body of statutory law (federal, state, local) that limits the power of a property holder to choose who to sell or lease residential housing.
* Originated out of the same concerns that generated the Public Accommodations law. But where Public Accommodations law focuses on the right of a property holder to choose whom to exclude from places open to the public, Fair Housing law focuses on the right of a property holder to choose whom to sell or lease private property.

*Fair Housing Council v. Roommate.com* (9th Cir. 2012): **DEFINITION OF “DWELLING” UNDER FHA**

Rule: The anti-discrimination provisions of the Fair Housing Act do not apply to the selection of roommates.

Facts: Roommate.com matches potential roommates based upon a series of questions about their gender, familial status, sexual orientation, other characteristics. Fair Housing Council alleged that website’s questions and its sorting/matching of users violated the FHA and California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA).

Holding: Although the definition of "dwelling" in the FHA could be interpreted to include or exclude shared living units, correct interpretation is that FHA excludes shared living units. In enacting FHA, Congress intended to address discriminatory practices by landlords, not arrangements between people who share a living space. Constitutionally, the right to intimate association and the right not to associate are fundamental liberties; a relationship with a roommate is an intimate one, and given roommates' shared access to home has significant safety implications. Because of the nature of the roommate relationship, allowing the gov to interfere with it would be invasion of privacy. Accordingly, discrimination in selection of a roommate is not prohibited under FHA.

*Human Rights Commission v. LaBrie* (Vt. 1995): **ESTABLISHING DISCRIMINATORY INTENT**

Rule: A privately enforced per dwelling occupancy limit must be at a minimum reasonable.

Facts: McCarthys bought a mobile home on lot in a trailer park owned by LaBrie. Park had a policy that people with minor children could not be residents. Subsequently, Vermont Fair Housing Act prohibited discrimination against residents with minor children, so LaBrie changed the park’s policy to prohibit more than two occupants in each home in the park. However, even after this change, no individuals with minor children became residents. About a year later, the McCarthys had a child and returned home from the hospital to find a notice to vacate “upon arrival of your third occupant.”

Holding: A privately enforced per-dwelling limit of two occupants is unreasonable. If the limit has legitimate reasons behind it, then it could be considered lawful, but on its own, due to the nature of the traditional American family, a ban on more than two occupants is effectively the same as a ban on minor children, which is prohibited. Although LaBrie’s occupancy policy limiting residences to two residents appears neutral on its face, the park has maintained the status quo of no minor children since the change. This is evidence that the new policy was enacted to comply with new state law while maintaining the old policy’s effects. There is no credible evidence that the septic system or water supply at the park could not support an increase in residents.

*Sprague v. City of Madison* (1996): **DEFINITION OF “HOUSING” UNDER MGO**

Rule: Any person with right of rental is prohibited from refusing rent to any person because of the person’s sexual orientation.

Facts: Two housemates advertised for two more housemates and chose Sprague. When they extended offer to her, knew of her sexual orientation. Sprague accepted and made a rent deposit. Afterwards, they informed her they were withdrawing their offer bc were not comfortable living with a person of her sexual orientation. Sprague alleged discrimination based on sexual orientation.

Holding: Madison General Ordinance (MGO) stated that a tenant having the right of rental may not deny housing to anyone on the basis of their sexual orientation. “Housing” includes housemate arrangements for profit such as this one, so cases that deal with the right to privacy in the home or family, or the right to engage in First Amendment activity free of unwarranted governmental intrusion, do not apply. The housemates relinquished their right to any such constitutional protection when they rented for profit. Bc they refused to allow Sprague to rent a room in their house solely on the basis of her sexual orientation, in violation of MGO.

**Unit 4:**

Privilege To Use

**Law of Nuisance**

**CASES**: *Dobbs v. Wiggins* (Ill., 2010), *Johnson v. Paynesville Farmers* (Minn. 2012)

LAW OF TRESPASS

* Protects the right of exclusive possession.
* Requires NO showing of harm bc protects right of exclusive possession.

LAW OF NUISANCE

* Protects the right to quiet enjoyment of the land.
* REQUIRES showing substantial and unreasonable harm.
* NUISANCE = substantial and unreasonable interference with the use or enjoyment of land.

*Paynesville*: “The law of nuisance deals with indirect or intangible interference with an owner’s use and enjoyment of land, while trespass deals with direct and tangible interferences with the right to exclusive possession of land”

INTANGIBLE TRESPASS PROBLEM: “The expansion of the tort of trespass to include invasions by intangible matter potentially subjects countless persons and entities to automatic liability absent any demonstrated injury.” (*Paynseville*)

* SOLUTION: Add a harm requirement (Washington & Alabama).

TRESPASS + HARM PROBLEM: Erodes “unconditional right to exclude others, even when no damages are provable.” (*Paynesville*)

* ALTERNATIVE: Refuse to recognize intangible trespass. Preserve distinction between laws of trespass/nuisance.

WHEN TO BRING A NUISANCE CLAIM:

1. Ex ante - Not to early under the **doctrine of anticipatory nuisance**, which bars a nuisance claim before the use is in place.
   1. Could enter world of contracts (servitudes - contracts that run with the land forever and bind future people there; zoning ordinances - pass law)
   2. You have to prove two things:
      1. “Near certainty” that the nuisance would take place
      2. That once nuisance-causing activity begins, cost of dismantling may weigh against finding a nuisance
2. Ex post - Not too late. You must sue before the **statute of limitations** runs out.
   1. Theory of commons (could get people to come together and negotiate)
   2. Many courts distinguish between a **temporary** and **permanent** nuisance:
      1. **Permanent** - statute of limitations begins at the time nuisance begins
      2. **Temporary** - your claim “accrues anew upon each injury”

MAJORITY RULE: REASONABLE USE TEST (Restatement (Second) of Torts, 3-4):

1. Is defendant’s act a proximate cause?
2. Is the plaintiff’s interest within the right to the “use and enjoyment of land”?
3. Is the interference substantial?
   1. What is the extent of the harm?
   2. What is the character of the harm?
4. Is the harm unreasonable?
   1. What are the economic and social values of the activity?
   2. Is the activity suitable for the location?
   3. Who came first, plaintiff or activity?
   4. What is the practicability and fairness of making either party avoid the conflict?
5. Any additional fairness and/or welfare concerns?
6. Fairness:

* Character of the harm - aesthetic less serious than health, safety
* Distributive considerations - is it fair to make owner bear costs of defendant’s socially beneficial activity, or should the costs be spread to the owner causing damage?
* Fault - is owner engaged in disfavored activity? Inappropriate for area? Did plaintiff come to the nuisance?

1. Welfare:

* Costs and benefits - of allowing the harmful conduct v. of prohibiting it
* Incentives - to engage in the respective activities. What effects will liability/immunity have?
* Lower cost avoider - which party can more cheaply avoid the cost?

1. What is the appropriate remedy?

* **Policy Critiques**
* Standard, not rule. No hard and fast test, no hierarchy of how factors weigh, so gives a lot of power to trial judge
* Rule would be more administrable/efficient. Clear, so people would sue each other less.
* Doesn’t give adequate warning to person who might create the nuisance. What’s too loud for your neighbors?

COMMON ENEMY RULE (“Damnum Absque Injuria”), 17 states

Property owners have an absolute freedom to develop their property without liability for any resulting damage to neighbors caused by runoff, etc. Most states using this rule have modified it to impose liability for negligence, allowing damages for foreseeable harm, or failure to install devices that would restrict the flow.

1. **Justifications**:
   1. **Labor/investment** (**Locke**)—you own this property, it is your right to develop it and realize the gain
   2. **Socially useful**—We want to encourage people to develop and engage in enterprise
   3. **Administrable**—You clearly know who is right (property owners) and who is wrong
   4. **Aligns with national principles** of **freedom** to use your property how you want to. BIG tension with Civil Law rule, which prioritizes **security**
2. **Problem**: **Inefficient**—you are shifting externalities onto your neighbors. Encourages bad incentives for developers

CIVIL LAW/NATURAL FLOW RULE (“sic utere”)

Property owners must use their property in a way that does not injure their neighbors. You have a strict liability/veto rights remedy—the injured plaintiff has legal rights to injunction and damages

1. **Justifications**:

* **Fair**—everyone gets protection from damages to their investment—you get security.
* **Efficient**—it would give incentives against property damage and to make your investment safe to use

1. **Problems**: **Not Socially Useful** (disincentivizes development)

THEORIES:

1. Classical Economics – Externalities: costs imposed on third parties that are not taken into account in the actor’s own cost-benefit determinations. Internalize: classic economic analysis of nuisance sought to make the factory to pay for and therefore internalize the external harms that its operation causes.
2. Pigou Style Argument: Bright-Line Rule – Nuisance-feasors should have to internalize its costs of doing business. Assign entitlements to injured parties to be free of harm.
3. Coase Style Argument (1960): Case-by-Case – Both parties will buy back their entitlements in a second transaction. If transaction costs are zero and property rights over the relevant resources are well-defined, parties involved in an externality situation will bargain to an efficient resolution, regardless of to whom the property rights are initially assigned.
4. Sunstein and Thaler: Case-by-case – Coase is wrong! Transaction costs are too high and people are not rational enough! Courts should assign the entitlement to the party most willing to pay in order to maximize total welfare.
5. Posner: Case-by-Case – But if initial distributions of wealth are unjust, deriving entitlements from willingness to pay will undermine claims to justice.
6. Prioritarianism (a): Case-by-Case – Weigh costs/benefits felt by worse-off party more heavily than those felt by better-off.
7. Prioritarianism (b): Bright-Line Rule – Serve distributive justice and anti-commodification values by creating bright-line rules to protect vulnerable populations!

*Johnson v. Paynesville* (Minn. 2012): **ESTABLISHING CAUSATION**

Importance: Court declines to get rid of the distinctions between trespass and nuisance.

Rule: When the invasion of a plaintiff’s land is committed by an intangible agency, such as particulate matter, such invasion does not constitute trespass; does not force landowner to share possession of his land like the invasion of physical matter does. But, this type of invasion may constitute nuisance if the intangible agency interferes with the landowner’s use or enjoyment of his land.

Facts: Johnsons owned organic fields next to conventional non-organic fields. Paynesville sprayed pesticides onto adjacent fields and wind allegedly caused some pesticides to drift onto Johnsons’ fields, so Johnsons stopped selling their soybeans and alfalfa as organic for 3 years. Brought suit for trespass and nuisance.

Holding: The sprayed pesticides are intangible, particulate matter. Thus, even if they did drift onto the Johnsons’ crops, such drift cannot constitute trespass under Minnesota law. The Johnsons do not assert that the Cooperative’s spraying prevented them from possessing their land exclusively. Rather, the Johnsons’ claim is that the spraying prevented them from selling their crops organically. This is a claim of interference with the Johnsons’ use of their land, which is a claim for nuisance.

*Dobbs v. Wiggins* (Ill. 2016): **ESTABLISHING SUBSTANTIAL AND UNREASONABLE HARM; DECIDING REMEDIES**

Importance: Reasonable Use Test (majority rule).

Rule: Reasonable Use Test – To maintain a claim for nuisance, a plaintiff must prove that the alleged invasion of his right to use/enjoy his property is (1) substantial, (2) intentional or negligent, (3) unreasonable. In determination, courts examine the effects of the invasive conduct on a reasonable person. The allegedly invasive conduct must be substantially physically offensive to the senses.

Facts: Wiggins moved in next door 15 years after Dobbses and began breeding, selling, kenneling dogs; had up to 100 on his property at one point. As he increased number of dogs on his property, neighbors began complaining and he attempted unsuccessfully to mitigate the noise. Dobbses sought an injunction on grounds that Wiggins’s barking dogs constituted a nuisance. Testified that noise prevented them from enjoying their land as they had before he moved in: kept windows open, yard work, sat/hosted outside.

Holding: The noise was substantial and unreasonable. The circuit court was within its discretion to outweigh the harm to the Dobbses v. the utility of Wiggins’s business & the suitability of his land for such a business, and determine that the use was a nuisance. The Dobbses were on the land first, and given Wiggins’s prior failed attempts, mitigating the noise without limiting the number of dogs is not possible. Thus, affirmed but remanded to determine the correct number of bird dogs allowed(erred in limiting to only 6, must be some number between 6 and 69 that won’t tank the business and won’t be a substantial invasion for plaintiffs.)

**Nuisance: Choice of Remedy**

**CASES**: *Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.* (NY 1969), *Fontainebleau v. Forty Five* (Fla. 1959)

Early America: Nuisance → Automatic Injunction. Industrialized America: Retreat from Automatic Injunction.

*Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.* (NY 1969):

Rule: Permanent damages, as opposed to an injunction, are appropriate when the damages resulting from a nuisance are significantly less than the economic benefit derived from the party causing the harm.

Facts: Atlantic Cement has factory that releases dust, smoke, vibrations. Boomer and neighbors sued for injunction and damages alleging injury to property.

Holding: Grants injunction until Atlantic Cement pays Boomer permanent damages. Injunction here would require Atlantic to completely close its operation unless a cleaner method of producing cement could be found; unfair to Atlantic (pollution problem is experienced by all cement factories). The economic benefit of keeping the factory open is greater than the harm suffered by Boomer, so most equitable solution is to award a temporary injunction.

Dissent: By deviating from the rule that continuous nuisances are subject to injunctions, the majority is perpetuating the country’s pollution problem. By allowing Atlantic to continue its operations upon paying permanent damages, no further incentive to develop clean technology. Essentially, majority is allowing Atlantic to continue to commit a wrong, if they pay upfront for it.

*Fountainbleau v. Forty-Five Twenty-Five* (Fla. 1959):

Rule: A landowner may use his property in a reasonable way as long as it does not injure the legal rights of another.

Facts: The Fontainebleau Hotel began constructing a fourteen-story addition. Eden Roc Hotel next door would have addition’s shadow (light and air) over its cabana, swimming pool, winter sunbathing area that would render the beach unusable. Eden Roc attempting to enjoin construction.

Holding: As long as no legal right is infringed, a landowner may put the property to any reasonable and lawful use. There is no legal right to the free flow of light or air across one’s property, absent a contractual or statutory obligation to the contrary. If a structure serves a useful purpose, it does not give rise to a cause of action even if it does interfere with a neighbor’s view or air and light.

**Law of Servitudes: Express Easements**

**CASES**: *Green v. Lupo* (Wash. 1982), *Cox v. Glenbrook Co.* (Nev. 1962)

**Servitude** – right or an obligation that “runs with the land” meaning that it automatically passes to subsequent owners or possessors of the land.

**Affirmative servitudes** (easements) – rights to use another’s land for a limited purpose.

* Most common type: right of way.
* Another type: profit a prendre – allows non-owners to collect resources from the land.

**Negative servitudes** (modernly “covenants”) – restrictions with respect to what owners can do with their own land

* Traditionally limited to:
  + Right to lateral support of one’s building
  + Rights to prevent both light and air from being blocked by construction on neighboring land
  + Right to prevent interference with the flow of an artificial stream such as an aqueduct
* Conservation easements – preventing development of land for environmental purposes
* Historic preservation easements – preventing destruction or alteration of buildings that have historical or architectural importance
* Solar easements – to protect access to sunlight for solar energy
* Appurtenant Easement – has both a benefited or dominant estate and a servient estate. The benefit runs with parcel of land
  + Dominant Estate – benefited by the appurtenant easement
  + Servient Estate – burdened by the appurtenant easement
* Easement in Gross – its benefit is held by a particular individual/entity rather than running with a parcel of land
  + Servient Estate – burdened by the easement in gross
  + Apportionability – question of divisibility of the easement
  + Nonexclusive – grantor of the servient estate has reserved for himself the right to use the easement in conjunction with the grantee, easement is generally held to be nonapportionable
  + Exclusive – grantor has no right to use the easement in conjunction with the grantee

PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPRESS EASEMENTS

An express easement will run with the burdened or benefited estate if:

1. Writing – the original easement is in writing and complies with the Statute of Frauds
2. Notice – for the burden to run on subsequent owners of the servient estate, the subsequent owners must have notice
   * Actual notice – if the subsequent owners in fact know about the existence of the easement
   * Inquiry notice – if there are visible signs of use by non-owners, such as telephone poles, above-ground utility lines, or a path across the property, the owner may be put on inquiry notice
   * Constructive notice – if the deed conveying the easement is recorded in the proper registry of deeds in the proper place, and if a reasonable search of the registry would lead to discovery of the deed, then subsequent owners are deemed to be on constructive notice
3. Intent – the grantor of the easement intends for the deed to bind future owners of the servient estate (or future owners of the dominant estate).

INTERPRETING AN EXPRESS EASEMENT

1. Is the written instrument ambiguous?
2. Is there a presumption against easement in gross?
3. Is the servient owner entitled to impose reasonable restraints on a right of way?

*Green v. Lupo* (Wash. 1982): **CATEGORY OF EASEMENT**

Rule: There is a presumption that an easement is appurtenant to a parcel of land and not an easement in gross. Under this presumption, an easement will not be considered an easement in gross if there is anything in the conveyance or surrounding circumstances suggesting that the easement was intended to be appurtenant to land kept by the grantor.

Facts: Greens own a parcel of land with a house, sold northern portion to Lupos. Lupo requested a deed release for part of the property, and Greens agreed in exchange for the promise of an easement over part of Lupo's portion. The terms of the easement were contained in a written agreement, which provided, among other things, that the easement was promised to "Don Green and Florence B. Green," and that easement was "for ingress and egress for road and utilities purpose." The easement was to allow the Greens to have access to the land retained by the Greens to build and live in a cabin. Greens used some of their remaining land for mobile homes, and some of the mobile-home residents used the easement as a practice runway for their motorcycles. This caused tension between Lupo and Greens, and Lupo refused to formally grant the easement. Lupo also blocked the easement to restrict access from the Greens' property. The Greens brought suit to specifically enforce the easement agreement.

Holding: Easement was granted specifically to Greens for the purpose of "ingress and egress for road and utilities." Ambiguous conveyance, bc it is both to specific people and for a purpose that benefits the dominant estate. Considering all the facts and circumstances, however, was an easement appurtenant. Granted to give access to the land for purposes of building/inhabiting cabin on the property. This reference to the land with no language limiting access to only the Greens, when combined with the presumption of appurtenance, weigh in favor of finding the easement to be appurtenant. Additionally, the trial court must devise reasonable restrictions on motorcycle use on the property that will prevent a dangerous nuisance without unreasonably interfering with the dominant owners' use of the easement.

Notes:

* An easement granted for purposes such as roads, utilities, ingress, and egress is an easement appurtenant because it benefits the adjacent parcel. An easement appurtenant becomes part of the land that it benefits, and it passes with possession of the dominant parcel unless it is otherwise limited.
* By contrast, an easement that designates a specific person as the dominant owner is more likely to be considered a personal easement, or an easement in gross.
* If the conveyance of land is ambiguous, parol evidence is admissible to help determine whether the parties intended an express easement to be appurtenant or in gross. The court may consider the unique circumstances of the parties and the property, as well as the parties’ conduct and admissions, in making this determination.

*Cox v. Glenbrook Co.* (Nev. 1962): **SCOPE OF EASEMENT**

Rule: When a right-of-way granted by easement appurtenant is conveyed to a new easement holder, the use of the easement must be of the kind contemplated by the grantor and must not constitute an unreasonable burden on the servient estate that was not contemplated by the grantor. The use of the easement must conform to the intent of the original parties, or it risks reaching beyond the scope. (Such a use can include subdividing the dominant estate if it does not cause an unreasonable burden. A subdivision is allowable because the easement is appurtenant to the entire estate, not to an individual so if the dominant estate is divided, the number of easement holders may be as well.)

Facts: Glenbrook Company resort granted easement to Quill for use of Glenbrook back road to get to Quill house. The road primarily used (back road) had only enough room for one car to pass through at a time. Glenbrook granted an easement in writing “over the roads of [Glenbrook] as now located” to Quill, “his heirs and assigns forever.” When Quill died, Kenneth Johnson bought property, then sold to Cox who proposed dividing property into smaller parcels to develop it into a residential area, widening back road, and possibly allowing future residents of development to use it. Parties sought declaratory judgment on scope and extent of easement.

Holding: Cox may subdivide the easement, allowing for multiple easement holders so long as their use does not cause an unreasonable burden to Glenbrook in the future. However, the widening of the back road so that two cars can pass at the same time is not a kind of use that Glenbrook or Quill contemplated in the Quill Easement, and would impose an undue burden on servient estate. Cox can maintain/improve the back road bc these activities promote the use for which the Quill Easement was granted, but the intent of the parties was to allow the widening of the back road. Therefore, width of back road is limited to its width at date of Quill Easement.

**Easements By Implication: By Estoppel, Prior Use, Necessity**

**CASES**: *Lobato v. Taylor* (Colo. 2002), *Granite Properties v. Manns* (Ill. 1987), *Finn v. Williams* (Ill. 1941)

A. Easement by **Estoppel**: General Requirements

* Permission from the owner to use the land;
* Reliance on continuation of the permission, where reliance was both

a. Foreseeable b. Reasonable

* Changed position by the claimant in reliance on continuation
* Finding an easement is necessary to prevent injustice

*Lobato v. Taylor* (Colo. 2002): **EASEMENT BY ESTOPPEL**

Rule: A court can imply an easement created by estoppel when (1) the landowner permitted another party to use the land under circumstances in which it was reasonably foreseeable that the user would substantially change position believing that the permission would not be revoked, (2) the user substantially changed position in reasonable reliance on that belief, and (3) injustice can be avoided only by establishment of a servitude.

Facts: After Mexican American War, Beaubien acquired a grant of about 1 million acres in future Colorado from Mexico. In 1850s, he recruited families to settle and live on land as farmers. In 1863, he signed Beaubien Document that granted the settlers rights of access to common lands for resource-gathering. In 1960, Taylor bought a piece of Beaubien land, deed stated that he acquired the tract subject to “claims of the local people by prescription or otherwise to right to pasture, wood, and lumber and so-called settlement rights in, to, and upon said land.” However, Taylor refused to allow local landowners access to the land. Farmers claimed easement rights to access the land.

Holding: Easement by estoppel for pasture, firewood, and timber. (1) The rights were expected by the settlers, intended by Beaubien under the terms of the Beaubien Document, and necessary because utilization of the timber was needed to heat and build homes, and the ability to graze was needed to feed cattle. (2) Settlers moved their entire families from miles around to build houses and farms. (3) The access rights at issue have been around for over 100 years and were a condition of the land grant to Taylor. To eradicate these rights would constitute an injustice. (Also prescriptive easement and an easement from prior use.)

Dissent: Majority should not have found an easement by estoppel because there is no evidence that Beaubien or his successors in interest intended to have the plaintiffs’ predecessors in interest rely to their detriment on the grant.

B. Easement by **Prior Use**: General Requirements

* Servient and dominant estates were once under common ownership;
* One parcel was previously used for the benefit of the other parcel in a manner that was both

a. Apparent b. Continuous

* The use is either “reasonably necessary” or “convenient” for enjoyment of the dominant estate

*Granite Properties v. Manns* (Ill. 1987): **EASEMENT BY PRIOR USE, IMPLIED INTENT AND NECESSITY**

Rule: A landowner establishes an easement implied by prior use if he proves: (1) ownership over both the dominant and servient parcels and a subsequent transfer of ownership to the servient parcel, (2) that, before the transfer, the use being claimed was apparent, continuous, and permanent, and (3) the easement is necessary and beneficial to the owner’s use of the property he kept. These requirements are in place because proof of prior use is evidence that the parties intended an easement even if it was left out of the deed.

Facts: Granite sold to Manns a part of tract that was in between apartment building and shopping center. Two driveways were each situated on Manns land and Manns knew this when bought the property. Manns found no recorded easements (no notice) but did see the two driveways before buying (constructive notice). Driveways were used by Granite for years before. Even though there was another driveway that led to back of shopping center, use of this driveway was necessary for proper functioning bc there was not enough room in other driveway for large delivery trucks to exit; other driveway led to parking lot of apartment complex and was no other feasible place to put parking lot, was only access point. After Manns bought the tract, told Granite to stop using driveways. Manns want the standard to be “absolutely necessary,” not “reasonably necessary” for access by Granite.

Holding: Easements from prior use. (1) Owned entire tract of land and subsequently conveyed the land on which the driveways are situated to the Manns. (2) Manns admitted to noticing Granite’s use of both driveways when they bought the land, Granite’s use was continuous for many years before the conveyance, and Granite’s use is permanent because the driveways were covered in gravel, thus fixed as its present use. (3) Without driveway use, shopping center and apartment complex cannot be run properly.

C. Easement by **Necessity**: General Requirements

* Servient and dominant estates were once under common ownership
* At the time of severance, the dominant estate became landlocked

*Finn v. Williams* (Ill. 1941): **EASEMENT BY NECESSITY**

Rule: An implied easement by necessity may lie dormant through multiple transfers of land, but it passes with each transfer and may be exercised at any time. An easement by necessity over a conveyer’s land is implied where the only available means of ingress and egress to a highway is over the conveyer’s land or that of a stranger.

Facts: In 1895, Williams sold part of a parcel to Bacons, who then sold it to Finns. The only means of getting to the nearest highway and market from the Finns’ land was by crossing over Williams’s land or that of a stranger. However, Williams refused to give the Finns permission to cross over her land. Essentially no ingress or egress from where they live.

Holding: Easement by necessity was implied with the conveyance from Williams to Bacon because the only available route to the highway and market for Bacon was over Williams’s land. Although this easement may not have been used by the Finns’ predecessors in interest, they have the right to exercise the easement at any time because it passes with each transfer.

| Writing complying with Statute of Frauds | | |
| Intent to run (presumed if appurtenant) | | |
| Privity including both –   1. Horizontal privity: covenant was created during transfer of burdened and benefited land; or parties are in lessor-lessee relationship or own mutual easements. 2. Vertical privity: Current owners obtained land by legal transfer from original covenantors. | Actual, inquiry, or constructive notice to owner of servient estate; enforcer must be intended beneficiary of covenant. | Actual, inquiry, or constructive notice to owner of servient estate; enforcer is intended beneficiary. For affirmative obligations (e.g., obligation to pay homeowners association fees, obligation to maintain lawn) burden will only run to tenant if makes more sense for tenant to perform, but benefit can be enforced by either tenant or landowner. |
| Touch and concern — direct effect on use or value of land. Both burden and benefit must touch and concern some land. Benefits in gross will not run against owners of servient estates unless held by governments or nonprofits. | Touch and concern, same as for real covenants — direct effect on use or value of land. Both burden and benefit must touch and concern some land. Benefits in gross will not run against owners of servient estates unless held by governments or nonprofits. | Enforceable unless “unreasonable”: Covenant is not arbitrary, spiteful, capricious, does not unreasonably burden constitutional right, restrain alienation or restrain trade, and does not otherwise violate public policy. Benefits in gross can run so long as benefit holder has “legitimate interest” in covenant and is identifiable. |

**Covenant**: Negative servitudes. Restrictions on use of land or obligations regarding land, held by one who does not own the land.

**Real covenants and equitable servitudes v. Negative easements**: At early common law, negative easements were restrictions on land held by others, limited in English law bc of concern that prescriptive rights in the status quo would prevent useful development of land. Limited to three categories:

* Rights of lateral support of one’s buildings
* Rights to free flow of light and air
* Rights to water from an artificial stream

Landowners entered into contracta to get around these limitations. But these contract rights generally did not bind/benefit subsequent parties. Had to be in privity of contract, or parties to original contract, to be bound or entitled to enforce its benefits. Negative easements are also problematic because it’s harder to have notice of a restriction, than of something you’re allowed to do. So real covenants developed to solve the problem that negative easements didn’t run with the land.

**Real Covenants v. Equitable Servitudes**: Real covenants require privity, equitable servitudes don’t; require notice instead. Remedy for real covenants is damages; remedy for equitable servitudes is injunction. After WW2, private agreements regarding land use that ran with the land became necessary aids to increasingly dense/interconnected land use. Concerns about notice req of equitable servitudes grew more insignificant. Many courts relaxed restrictions on covenants, and covenants and equitable servitudes law merged. Modified /abolished privity req, touch and concern req. \*\*\*Some courts still adhere.

**Real covenants**: [necessary to get damages] Developed to address problem of contract rights not binding/benefiting subsequent parties. Agreement could bind successors to land if it was:

* (\*note that most jurisdictions have tacked on notice req here as well)
* In writing
  + Complying with Statute of Frauds. And like all transfers of property interests lasting more than a year, the covenant must be created in writing signed by the grantor. A covenant written in a deed satisfies this requirement.
* Intended to bind future tenants
  + Intent may be established through language declaring the covenant is “on behalf of owner and his successors or assigns”, or that the covenant “runs with the land”
  + If the covenant is appurtenant, courts presume the grantor intended it to run with the land
* Touched and concerned the land (affected use of the land itself)
  + Benefits the dominant estate and burdens the servient estate. On the burden side, covenant must affect the use and enjoyment of the land. On the benefit side, an obligation touches and concerns a dominant estate if it improves enjoyment of the land or increases its market value.
  + No clear test so rule of thumb: the covenant must affect the legal rights of the parties as landowners
* There was privity of estate (mutual ownership of the land / simultaneous interests in same land) btwn covenanting parties
  + **Instantaneous** **privity**: Finding privity if a covenant was created during the legal transfer of land. Fiction: at the moment the deed passes from seller to buyer, parties have a fleeting simultaneous interest in property. Prevents restriction of real covenants to landlord-tenants, expands to seller-buyer.
  + **Horizontal** privity - between original covenanting parties
  + **Vertical** privity - between original covenanting parties and succeeding owners
    - **Strict** - transfer of ownership. Grantor does not retain any future interests in the land. Outright sale.
    - **Relaxed** - lease. Allows covenants to run to all those assigned possession, tenants. Adopted by many courts

**Equitable servitudes**: [necessary to get injunction] Same things as Covenants, except that (1) it swaps out privity for notice of restriction AND (2) the relief is injunctive, not damages.

**Notice**:

* Actual - buyer/lessee on actual notice of the covenant if actually told about it, or otherwise made aware of it.
  + *Neponsit*: Unclear if Emigrant was on actual notice when purchased property at foreclosure sale.
* Implied - if condition of the premises would make a reasonable purchaser inquire about the condition of the covenant
* Constructive - if restriction was recorded within the registry of deeds and could be found via a reasonable search of the records prior to sale. Reasonable purchaser is expected to search the title to find out whether the property is burdened by land use restrictions
  + *Neponsit*: Every deed in Emigrant’s chain of title provided that the conveyances were “subject to covenants and restrictions of former deeds of record”, implying that the Deyer deed (fam Emigrant bought from in foreclosure sale) was recorded. So Emigrant on constructive notice.

### HOW TO CHALLENGE A COVENANT

1. Reasonableness and public policy violations
2. Constitutional violations
3. Claims of discrimination under the FHA
4. Restrictions on Alienability
5. Unreasonable restraint of trade (due to concerns of monopoly)

*Neponsit v. Emigrant Savings* (1938): **TRADITIONAL TEST FOR REAL COVENANTS**

Importance: Also gives opportunity to examine what equitable servitudes would look like. Case occurs when ppl are starting to find defeasible fees unappealing.

Rule: (1) A covenant contained in a deed requiring the payment of money “touches and concerns” the land if it substantially affects the rights of the parties as landowners. (2) Privity of estate will exist in substance if not in form between property owners and an owners’ association when the association is acting as a medium through which enjoyment of a common right is preserved.

Facts: In 1911, Neponsit Realty Company developed land as a residential community and sold the property to Deyers. The deeds contained a covenant requiring the purchaser and all successors to pay an annual fee to the Neponsit Property Owners’ Association (POA) for maintaining common areas like roads. Covenant gave Neponsit/successors the right to foreclose a lien for failure to make payment, expressly stated that it was a real covenant running with the land.Emigrant bought the property at a foreclosure sale. Emigrant’s deed contained the covenant. Emigrant failed to pay the fee, POA sued to foreclose on the lien.

Holding: POA may enforce the covenant. Generally, there must be privity of estate for a claimant to enforce a real covenant. There is technically no privity of estate between a property owner and a homeowners’ association, but based on equitable principles, restrictive covenants have been enforced without privity of estate if the covenant was entered into to benefit the claimant. This case does not involve a restrictive covenant, but the court may look behind the corporate form of the POA. The covenant provided that the POA would be the assignee of the benefit of the covenant. The POA is merely acting as a “medium through which enjoyment of [the owners'] common right may be preserved.” There is privity of estate between the property owners and the POA “in substance, if not in form.”

*Davidson v. D. Katz & Sons* (NJ 1990): **ANTI-COMPETITIVE COVENANTS; LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS**

Rule: A real covenant is not enforceable if the court determines that the covenant is unreasonable.

Facts: Davidson owned a supermarket, sold nearby one to Katz with covenant to not have a supermarket there for another 40 years. Katz sold it to New Brunswick Housing Authority who leases it to C-Town to open a new supermarket. Davidson sued Katz, NBHA, and C-Town to enforce covenant in deed to Katz.

Holding: Under NJ reasonableness test, a covenant is unenforceable if it unreasonable in light of public interest. NJ has abandoned the rigid “touch and concern” doctrine governing covenants. Instead, there are eight factors that must be considered. Here, covenant is contrary to public interest / policy goal (rehabilitation of urban cities) → unreasonable → unenforceable.

1. parties’ intent when they executed the covenant, and whether the intent did not interfere with existing commercial laws like antitrust laws or public policy;
2. whether the covenant impacted the consideration for the conveyance, which would provide a measure of the value of the covenant to parties at the time;
3. clarity of the covenant’s restriction;
4. whether the covenant is in a recorded writing and the subsequent taker had notice;
5. whether the covenant is for a reasonable duration and area; perpetuity may often be unreasonable;
6. the extent to which the covenant unreasonably restrains trade or secures monopoly for covenantor;
7. whether the covenant is inconsistent with the public interest;
8. and whether changed circumstances since the covenant’s execution have made the covenant unreasonable.

California Davis-Stirling Act (1970’s) – Restrictions in covenants “should be enforced unless they are wholly arbitrary, violate a fundamental public policy, or impose a burden on the use of affected land that far outweighs any benefit.

*Nahrstedt v. Lakeside Village* (Cal. 1994): **COVENANT AS PART OF BY-LAW**

Rule: Common interest development use restrictions are enforceable unless unreasonable or in violation of public policy.

Facts: Nahrstedt purchased a unit in the Lakeside Village Condominiums and moved in with her three cats. When the Homeowners’ Association learned of the cats, it demanded their removal. Nahrstedt sued the Association, arguing that the restriction was unreasonable as applied to her cats, which were kept indoors and not free to roam any common areas.

Holding: Must comply with covenant; not unreasonable and does not violate public policy. Common interest development rules generally are given a presumption of validity and will be enforced unless unreasonable, or if they are unconstitutional or against public policy (attract buyers looking for stable environment; promoties predictability).

Dissent, Arabian: Arbitrary, unreasonable. The undue burden on the use of owners who can maintain pets without creating a nuisance substantially outweighs whatever utility the restriction serves in abstract. Does not violate public policy; embodies sense of freedom and self-determination emblematic of nation’s character. Majority ignores the fact that the covenant burden is restricted to the unit owner’s interior space and does not impact the common space in any way. Owning pets that do not disturb the quiet enjoyment of other owners’ property serves no discernible benefit to the common interest development. Devoid of humanity.

*Neuman v. Grandview* (Fla. 2003): **COVENANT AS PART OF DECLARATION**

Rule: Rules in a declaration of condominium are valid if reasonable and don’t violate public policy or owners’ constitutional rights.

Facts: Grandview operates a condominium complex in Florida. Neuman is one of a group of residents at Grandview who reserved the auditorium to conduct a religious service. Other residents complained to management about the holding of a religious service in a common area. After a heated, argumentative resident meeting, 70 percent of residents voted in favor of prohibiting religious services, so Grandview enacted a rule that prohibited the use of the auditorium for religious services.

Holding: Grandview has the authority to enact a rule reasonably restricting use of its auditorium. The rule specifically prohibiting religious services in its auditorium is reasonable in light of Grandview’s concern that, based on the contentious condominium-wide meeting, serious conflict could arise between competing religious groups if services were not prohibited. In addition, the right to peaceably assemble that Neuman claims is violated has generally applied to the right to discuss government and politics and not religion.

**Creating Zoning Ordinances: Origins, Authority, And Process**

**CASES**: *Village of Euclid v. Ambler* (1926), *Village of Belle Terre v. Borass* (1974), *Moore v. City of East Cleveland* (1977)

Zoning serves same function as nuisance law: Limits harms that might arise from the proximity of incompatible land uses. Zoning ordinances are a relatively recent development of 1920’s, created to deal with the difficulties created by increasing urban populations. Constitutional doctrine framework evolves from 1920’s (*Euclid*) to 1970’s. The power to pass zoning regulations derives from states’ police powers. Zoning ordinances were a relatively recent development, created to deal with the difficulties created by increasing urban populations.

**Use/Euclidean Zoning** (*Euclid*) – Usually cumulative/pyramidal structure (residential may be built in industrial or commercial, but not industrial or commercial in residential.)

**Area Zoning** – Regulates size of lot, height of building, setbacks, etc.

**Subdivision Regulation** – Developers go through regulatory process/site plan review.

**Traditional Zoning v. New Urbanism** – Critics say traditional zoning favors suburban sprawl. New urbanism promotes mixed-use communities favoring walkability/transit/integration of multiple land uses in one space.

TEST FOR ZONING (*Belle Terre* Marshall Dissent Minority Test)

1. **Due Process**: Is there a fundamental right protected by the 14th Amendment which has been violated?

If yes, triggers strict scrutiny of 2. Powell’s *Moore* view.

If no, enter *Euclid* world. **Rational basis review**: Fairly debatable that reasonably related to gov interest?

(Only one case has ever not met this test.)

1. **Strict Scrutiny**: Is the ordinance absolutely necessary to protect a compelling and substantial government interest?

If no, ordinance unconstitutional. If yes, constitutional.

*Village of Euclid v. Ambler* (1926): **ESTABLISHES EUCLIDEAN ZONING AS CONSTITUTIONAL**

Rule: Municipal zoning regulations (which specifically create/maintain residential districts from which business/industry are excluded) are constitutional (even when substantially diminishes property values and separates people with discriminatory effect), unless arbitrary and unreasonable with no substantial relation to public health, safety, morals or general welfare. (Even thin rationale is sufficient; just claim the measure somehow benefits community policy goal.)

Facts: Ambler Realty owned land in Village of Euclid, a largely residential suburb of Cleveland. In 1922, Euclid enacted comprehensive zoning ordinances (concerned that urban environment would keep expanding into suburb; suburb wants to preserve residential character) and created a board of zoning appeals charged with enforcement. The regulations created different districts based on the class of use, including purely residential, mixed use, commercial, and industrial and partitioned Amber’s land in terms of uses permissible on it (notably, portions zoned prohibiting development of industry.) Ambler alleged the zoning ordinance violated the 14th Amendment and Ohio Constitution by depriving Ambler of liberty and property without due process. Specifically, Ambler argued that the ordinance reduced the land’s value by 75% and deterred potential buyers.

Holding: The zoning restriction scheme here may well prove to be unconstitutional as applied, but it is constitutional on its face.

*Village of Belle Terre v. Borass* (1974): **SINGLE-FAMILY ZONING CONSTITUTIONAL; MARSHALL DISSENT**

Importance: Fundamental right test for zoning constitutionality in Marshall Dissent. Maintains deferential *Euclid* standard.

Rule: Zoning regulations may be used to enhance and preserve the public welfare. Economic/social regulations are generally upheld against equal protection challenges where the law is reasonable and bears a rational relationship to a proper state objective. A zoning ordinance which prohibits unrelated persons from sharing quarters is an appropriate use of the gov’s police power.

Facts: Dickmans owned a house in Belle Terre, leased to 6 students of nearby university. Belle Terre had zoning ordinance which restricted land use to one-family dwellings, with “family” being defined as persons related by blood, adoption, or marriage, or two unmarried cohabitating people. Belle Terre cited violation of this ordinance bc the students were not a “family” (none related by blood, adoption, marriage). Dickmans and tenants brought suit alleging that the ordinance violated their equal protection rights.

Holding, Douglas: Ordinance is constitutionally permissible.

* No constitutionally-protected interest was implicated by the regulation; for example, the ordinance does not prohibit racial minorities from living within the city. The ordinance also does not burden fundamental rights such as the right to vote, the right of association, the right of access to the courts, or any right of privacy. The definition of “family” is an exercise of legislative discretion, and is outside the realm of judicial second-guessing.
* *Euclid*: Violates 14th Amendment only if unreasonable + arbitrary (*Euclid*). Ordinance here not arbitrary bc was designed to reduce noises/traffic, provide quiet/open spaces for children to play. (Same underlying principle as *Euclid*: Nice town, don’t want “urban problems” like noise)

Dissent, Marshall: Minority Rule: “It can withstand constitutional scrutiny only upon a clear showing that the burden imposed is necessary to protect a compelling and substantial government interest.” (Necessary: If town could achieve same goal via ordinance that does not discriminate constitutionally protected lifestyle choices, unconstitutional.)

* Village’s ordinance implicates fundamental constitutional rights. Violates freedom of association (right to establish a home under 14th Amendment) + right to privacy (discriminates on the basis of personal lifestyle).
* The ordinance can only be upheld by a clear showing that the burden is necessary to protect a compelling and substantial state interest. Here, it does not. The burden imposed by the ordinance is both overinclusive and underinclusive with respect to stated goals (controlling population density; preventing noise, traffic, and parking problems; and maintaining reasonable rental controls): Permits a “family” of twenty to live in one house so long as they were all related by blood, marriage, or adoption, but would not permit a much smaller group of persons to share a house simply because they are not so related.

*Moore v. City of East Cleveland* (1977): **FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TEST FOR CONSTITUTIONALITY**

Importance: An ordinance that “slices deeply into the family itself” is unconstitutional. (Distinct from *Belle Terre,* whichdidn’t seek to define what a family is.)

Rule: The right of related family members to live together is protected by the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, and necessarily encompasses a broader definition of “family” than just members of the nuclear family. Apply *Belle Terre* test.

Facts: City of East Cleveland enacted a housing ordinance that limited the occupancy of a dwelling unit to members of a single family. The ordinance narrowly defined the term “family” as encompassing only a few categories of related individuals. Moore lived in a home with her son and two grandsons, outside housing ordinance’s legal definition of “family.” When Moore refused to modify her living arrangement, charged with criminal penalties, convicted, and sentenced to a fine and five days in jail.

Holding, Powell (plurality): *Belle Terre* Test: Ordinance violates fundamental right. Legitimate government interests here, but there are less restrictive means that gov could use, so ordinance not necessary.

* CEC argued that its housing ordinance should be sustained based on *Belle Terre* (where a housing ordinance limiting occupancy in single residences was sustained because it bore a rational relationship to permissible state objectives). However, this case is distinguishable from *BT* bc this CEC ordinance limits blood relatives from living together. Intrusive regulation of family that examined under strict scrutiny.
* Gov objectives (preventing overcrowding, minimizing traffic, not financially burdening school system) only marginally served by ordinance, which is not necessary to accomplishment

Dissent, Stewart/Rehnquist: The ordinance should be upheld as a constitutional restriction on a non-fundamental right. Moore did not assert a claim to a liberty interest that is as highly valued as other liberty interests recently recognized by the Court as protected under the Due Process Clause.

Dissent. White: More deferential, like *Euclid.* Ordinance did not violate fundamental liberty interests, bc does not totally foreclose the possibility of this family living arrangement. Still permits her to live with grandchildren elsewhere in Cleveland metropolitan area.

**Challenging Zoning Classifications**

**CASES**: *Town of Belleville v. Parrillo’s Inc.* (N.J. 1980), *Stone v. City of Wilton* (Iowa, 1983), *Durand v. IDC Bellingham* (Mass. 2003)

*Town of Belleville v. Parrillo’s* (NJ 1980): **PRIOR NONCONFORMING USE**

Rule: An existing nonconforming use will be permitted to continue, only if it is a continuance of substantially the same kind devoted at the time of the passage of the zoning ordinance.

Facts: Parrillo’s operated as a restaurant in Belleville, which subsequently enacted zoning ordinances itemizing permitted uses for each zone. Operating a restaurant was not permitted under the new zoning laws. But bc operated as restaurant prior to enactment, permitted to continue because of its preexisting nonconforming use. However, some years later, Parrillo’s ceased its primary operation as a restaurant and began operating as a discotheque, which was also not permitted under the new zoning regulations.

Holding: A substantial change cannot be upheld as a preexisting nonconforming use; needs to be substantially same kind of use. Presumption against allowing an existing nonconforming use to continue if there is doubt. (Here: several significant changes after switch to discotheque, including: a reduction in tables, a change in lighting, an addition of loud music, and dancing replacing eating as the primary activity.)

*Stone v. City of Wilton* (Iowa, 1983): **VESTED RIGHTS CLAIMS**

Rule: In order to have vested rights in a zoning classification, the owner has to have made substantial efforts under the classification toward accomplishing the proposed project.

Facts: Stones bought an undeveloped parcel of land with plans to build a multi-family housing project. They paid architecture and engineering fees and secured a loan for construction. Before the start of construction, City of Wilton rezoned the land to only permit single-family residences bc of insufficient sewage, water, and electric services. Seek invalidation of rezoning their property.

Holding: For a property owner to have a vested right in a zoning classification, the owner must have made substantial efforts under the classification toward accomplishing the proposed project. Landowner paying for architectural and engineering services and devising a construction plan do not constitute a substantial enough effort. Stones’ efforts too preliminary, not so substantial as to create vested rights.

*Durand v. IDC Bellingham* (Mass. 2003): **CONTRACT ZONING CLAIMS**

Rule: An agreement including a voluntary offer of public benefits in exchange for a vote in favor of rezoning a parcel of land does not, standing alone, invalidate the legislative decision by the town to rezone if the agreement was consummated after the vote took place. A zoning by law will not be held invalid unless there is a demonstration by preponderance of evidence that the zoning regulation is arbitrary or unreasonable. The motives for granting a zoning bylaw does not affect the analysis of whether a zoning bylaw is valid.

Facts: Town wanted to increase its property tax base by industrializing an area. Picked area zoned for agricultural use that was next to an area zoned for industrial use as the place they should change. IDC Bellingham wanted to build power plant there and needed town to rezone, so agreed to make an $8 million gift to town if it voted to rezone. Town voted in favor of rezoning. Residents who owned nearby land sued claimed rezoning was void bc it constituted illegal contract zoning.

Holding: When someone offers money in exchange for the promise to vote for rezoning, it’s considered contract zoning which is invalid, but here no promise was made contingent upon the money where the board promised to vote one way or the other. Thus, bc the agreement does not invalidate the vote & the rezoning was valid (not arbitrary or unreasonable), does not violate any law.

Dissent: The agreement between IDC and Bellingham constitutes illegal contract zoning. The town agreed to exercise its police power to rezone the parcel of land in exchange for a promise of $8 million. This payment was unrelated to any aspect of the proposed development and therefore was not a lawful basis for the town’s vote.

**Challenging Exclusionary Zoning: Fair Housing Act**

**CASES**: *NAACP v. Mount Laure*l (N.J. 1975), *MHANY v. Nassau Count*y (2d Cir. 2016)

WAYS TO CHALLENGE EXCLUSIONARY ZONING ORDINANCES

1. U.S. Constitutional Challenges
   1. Economic Loss – Takings or Substantive Due Process (*Euclid*)
   2. Fundamental Right – Equal Protection Clause (*Belle Terre*)
   3. Fundamental Right – Substantive Due Process (*Moore*)
2. State Procedural/Common Law Challenges
   1. Can go further in protecting certain private rights of association, etc.
   2. Vested Rights (*Stone*)
   3. Contract Zoning (*Durand*)
3. Fair Housing Act (1968)
   1. Disparate impact (segregation in town under Huntington, or (if rule available), inclusionary zoning within town required under Mt. Laurel). Note burden-shifting framework for FHA Claim
   2. Some state statutes go further than FHA and bar discrimination on other grounds (sexual orientation, etc.)
   3. Discriminatory Impact Rule (*ICP; MHANY*)
4. State Constitutional Challenges
   1. The Mount Laurel Doctrine
5. *Belle Terre* Dissent Test – Fundamental right violated? No – Deference. Yes – Look to less restrictive alternatives.
6. Civil Rights Act of 1866: Corollary
   1. May also apply to housing under §1982, but only applies to race, and only offers damages (no injunctive relief)

REMEDIES – injunctive relief, compensatory damages, punitive damages

1. You can also file a complaint with HUD, which will investigate the matter. If HUD finds reasonable cause to believe a violation of the law has occurred, it must issue a “charge” on behalf of the aggrieved person.
2. Critiques of the remedies:
   1. Racial discrimination remains at extremely high levels, particularly in terms of the number of units shown to minority renters and home buyers
   2. Many victims fail to report violations or pursue claims
   3. The delay and expense of litigation undermines the deterrent value of the FHA
   4. Problem with the goal of finding intent - most discrimination may be the result of unconscious bias by landlords who do not see themselves as prejudiced.

*NAACP v. Township of Mount Laurel* (NJ 1975): **HUD MUST TAKE AFFIRMATIVE STEPS TO DESEGREGATE**

Importance: Reading case at its most extreme: every NJ resident has a right to housing.

Rule: A municipal town must provide opportunity for low/moderate-income families to live in town (through enactment of land use regulations), and may not constructively prevent low/moderate-income families from living in town.

Facts: Under Mount Laurel’s zoning regulations, much land was zoned exclusively for industry (but only a tiny fraction of that was actually used for industrial purposes; rest was left undeveloped). Because of town’s need to cover the high costs of schools, it sought primarily buildings with high tax rates (industrial buildings and expensive homes). NJ tax structure: Low density housing with fewer children → good ratables (bc use that generates taxes, with less demand for services). Lower property density → higher property values (same reasoning in *Euclid*.) NAACP brought suit claiming that the combined land use regulations unlawfully exclude low/moderate-income families from the town.

Holding: Regulations are unlawful. Zoning regulations must promote the general welfare.

Note: Tragedy of the commons: Almost everyone will act in their selfish interest and try to keep out people not acting in favor of the tax base. If town’s justification was permissible, no town would provide housing to lower income people.

*Texas H.U.D. v. Inclusive Communities* (2015): **INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION**

Importance: First case to show that disparate impact claims are cognizable under FHA.

Rule: FHA prohibits entities from making housing decisions that have a disparate impact on a protected class, even if this impact is not intended. Claim for disparate impact must meet a robust causality requirement; mere evidence of racial disparity is insufficient.

Facts: HUD regulations prohibit blanket prohibitions against those with criminal records. May violate FHA if landlord has policy prohibiting rentals to those with criminal records. Under Disparate Impact Theory, may violate 3604(a) (which covers race), because disproportionate number of people with criminal convictions are racial minorities.

Holding: The statutory language of FHA focuses on the consequences of the actions rather than the actor’s intent; FHA “because of race” does not require a showing of intentional discrimination.

*MHANY v. County of Nassau* (2nd Cir. 2016): **INTEGRATION UNDER FHA**

Importance: FHA prohibits housing practices and zoning restrictions with discriminatory intent or disparate impact on minorities.

Rule: See Below.

Facts: Garden City had no affordable housing and a relatively low minority population. Nassau County put two properties up for sale and proposed to zone them as multi-family residential group (R-M). Residents objected (concerns about increased traffic, desire to retain the “character” of single-family housing, consequences of introducing affordable housing). So City adopted new zoning category of residential-townhouse (R-T). County solicited proposals to purchase the properties. MHANY concluded that given the minimum bid, it would be financially impossible to build affordable housing on R-T land. Land sold to other company. MHANY prepared proposals of what it could have provided under R-M zoning, each containing at least 15 percent affordable housing. Alleged County’s change to R-T zoning violated FHA, bc it effectuated disparate treatment and disparately impacted minorities.

Holding: Disparate Treatment: Nassau County violated the FHA by rejecting the R-M zoning proposal. Discriminatory effect (dearth of minorities and affordable housing deprived, discriminatory intent (racial animus). By extension, Garden City had been driven by discriminatory intent. Disparate Impact: District court incorrectly applied circuit case law instead of HUD regulation.

Disparate Treatment Test

1. Plaintiff makes *prima facie* case for discrimination based on a protected category. Must show that hostility towards protected class was a significant factor in housing/zoning decision.
2. Defendant rebuts prima facie case by demonstrating that the decision/policy was necessary to achieve a legitimate, nondiscriminatory governmental interest.
3. Plaintiff must prove that the government intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff based on a prohibited category.

Disparate Impact Test

1. Plaintiff makes *prima facie* case for discrimination based on a protected category. Must demonstrate the existence of a facially neutral practice with a significantly disproportionate impact on a particular type of people.
   1. Predictably results in a disparate impact on a group of persons OR creates, increases, reinforces, or perpetuates segregated housing patterns because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.
   2. Case can be substantiated by statistical evidence or tendency to perpetuate segregation; relative % of people in each group affected, rather than absolute numbers.
2. Defendant rebuts prima facie case by demonstrating that the decision/policy was necessary to achieve a legitimate, nondiscriminatory governmental interest.
3. Pursuant to HUD Rule 1074, the plaintiff must show that the government’s interest could have been achieved by less discriminatory means.

**Unit 5:**

Immunity from Loss (Takings)

**Eminent Domain & Regulatory Takings**

**CASES**: *Kelo v. New London* (2005), *Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon* (1922), *Penn Central v. New York City* (1978)

OLD RULE: “A prohibition simply upon the use of property for purposes that are declared by valid legislation to be injurious to the health, morals, or safety of the community cannot, in any just sense, be deemed a taking or an appropriation of property.”

*(Mugler*: prohibiting manufacture/sale of alcohol did not constitute taking of P’s brewery, even tho had little value for other purposes.)

RECIPROCITY OF ADVANTAGE: Idea behind takings clause is that the government may not force some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole. If burden on *all*, then not a taking.

SCENARIOS FOR A TAKING UNDER 5TH AMENDMENT

1. Eminent domain

* Taking of the private property must be “for public use” and in exchange for “just compensation”)
* “Just compensation” = Fair market value; generally the amount the property would likely sell for on open market

1. Physical occupation
2. Regulatory taking

*Kelo v. New London* (2005): **EMINENT DOMAIN**

Rule: A state’s use of eminent domain to condemn property from private individuals and redistribute it to other private individuals constitutes a “public use” under the Fifth Amendment if it is rationally related to a conceivable public purpose, including an exclusively economic one.

Facts: New London, Ct. approved a new development project that involved using its eminent domain authority to seize private property to sell to private developers. The city stated that the purpose of this exercise of eminent domain was to create new jobs and increase tax revenues from the property sales. Kelo had owned a home there for over 60 years, and his property was in one of the areas scheduled to be condemned by the development project. Kelo and nine other private owners claimed violated the “public use” requirement of Fifth Amendment.

Holding: The city may validly exercise its eminent domain authority to take private property and distribute it to private developers without violating the Fifth Amendment's public use requirement. Area sufficiently distressed to justify program of economic rejuvenation. State legislative judgments about the prudence of programs providing for the public good in these precedent cases are entitled to great deference from the judicial branch.

Concurrence: Kennedy – rational-basis test should be used (more stringent standard of review), but still passes. Although courts should be deferential to legislative judgments, they should still engage in a sufficient factual inquiry to determine that eminent domain programs are not being used to unfairly advantage one private group over another in violation of Equal Protection Clause.

Dissent, Thomas: The protection of private property outweighed public necessity in the minds of the Framers, as they drafted significant legal protections of private property directly into the Constitution.

Dissent , O’Connor: Economic development takings are unconstitutional.

*Penn Central* Ad Hoc Test to Determine if there is a Regulatory Taking that Requires Compensation:

1. **The economic impact of the regulation on the particular owner (diminution of value)**
   1. Diminution in value alone is not enough to demonstrate a taking (*Euclid*)
   2. What is the denominator (*Penn Coal)*?
2. **The protection of reasonable or distinct investment-backed expectations**
   1. Opportunity cost of forgone development not a frustration of an investor-backed expectation. More likely to satisfy this prong if it can be shown that an investment has already been made in reasonable reliance on existing statutory or regulatory regime (*Penn Central)*
3. **The character of the governmental action**
   1. Adjusting the benefits/burdens of economic life justified if common good overall is promoted; courts deferential on government judgments as to what promotes welfare *(Penn Central)*
   2. Whether law legitimately prevents an owner from harming others by imposing negative externalities on neighbors or the community or is illegitimately requiring the owner to contribute a benefit…whether the law imposes a disparate impact on a few owners or constitutes a legitimate general regulatory law affecting a class of property that is appropriately subject to restrictions.
   3. Owners have no vested rights to destroy the environment or pollute.
   4. *Penn Coal*: “Government could hardly go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such charge in the general law.”
4. **Qualitative considerations**:
   1. **Magnitude of harm** – equivalent to an actual physical taking**; diminution of value**
   2. **Balance public interest against private harm** – not simply diminution to private owner, but extent to which the public interest demands such a diminution. **Reciprocity of advantage:** Certain regulations, however onerous, provide implicit compensation that mitigates the unfairness of not directly compensating owners.
   3. **Is it fair to concentrate harms as opposed to asking general public to bear burden?**

*Penn Coal v. Mahon* (1922): **HISTORICAL ORIGINS**

Importance: Mahon Factors For Determining if Taking has Gone “Too Far”: (a) Extent of the diminution of the value of the property, (b) Nature of the public interest served by the legislation

Rule: While the use of property may be regulated, overregulation will be considered a taking. When a state law causes sufficient diminution in property value and does not fall within the government’s police power, the state must take the land by eminent domain and provide just compensation.

Facts: In 1878, Penn Coal Co. conveyed the surface of a plot of land it owned to Mahon. Retained the right to mine underneath the property, and an explicit provision in the deed stated that Mahon was taking the land subject to any risks associated with mining beneath it. In 1921, Pennsylvania enacted a statute preventing coal mining that could possibly affect the integrity of any surface land. Mahon then sued Penn Coal, arguing that the new state law barred Pennsylvania Coal from mining under the property.

Holding: Permitted to continue its mining operation, bc Mahon took the land subject to the risks associated with mining. Overregulation would be a taking.

Dissent, Brandeis: The use of the police power will always interfere with one’s right to use his land however they see fit. Even though only one person involved here, statute still aims to protect public at large. Therefore, statute is not a taking; valid use of police power.

*Penn Central v. NYC* (1978): **AD HOC TEST**

Importance: Precedent decisions have been essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries based entirely on the facts of an individual case, with no precise standard articulated for when principles of fairness and justice require the payment of just compensation for a taking. In response to its frustration over this lack of standards, a new multi-factor test is articulated for determining when a taking requires the payment of just compensation to a property owner.

Rule: In determining whether a state regulation constitutes a taking under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, courts should consider (1) the economic impact of the regulation on the owner, (2) the extent to which the regulation has interfered with the owner’s reasonable investment-backed expectations, and (3) the character of the government action involved in the regulation.

Facts: NYC passes preservation law designating Grand Central Terminal a landmark. Owners want to build a 50-story office building above the station, and enter into long-term lease with occupant. But law imposes duty on owner to maintain exterior features of a landmark, unless Landmarks Preservation Commission allows.

Holding: The law is not a taking. Diminution of value alone is insufficient to establish a taking (*Euclid*). Also, may still develop smaller building, and TDRs still have value. Primary expectation not frustrated – present use of Terminal not impacted. That the law has a more severe impact on some landowners than others does not itself mean the law effects a taking. Won’t second-guess judgment of NYC that landmark preservation confers a benefit on all NYC citizens

Dissent, Rehnquist: The law’s landmarks designation is problematic bc it imposes significant costs/restrictions on landowners, without affording many benefits beyond honor of designation. Cost of preserving landmarks should be borne by all NYC taxpayers.

Penn Central’s overall assertion that any economic restriction imposed on the use of their property under the Landmarks Preservation law constitutes a taking which requires just compensation is rejected. The economic impact of the law on Penn Central does not constitute a total diminution of the value of its property, as it can still generate revenue from renting out portions of Grand Central Terminal. It is merely prohibited from gaining additional revenue from leasing the airspace rights above the building. Penn Central’s investment-backed expectations are not significantly impaired by the regulation, as the revenue from developed airspace was not an option when Penn Central first invested in the property. Finally the governmental invasion caused by the regulation is not physical (an invasion which is almost always upheld as a taking.) Rather, the government “invasion” in the present case is merely a prohibition on further development of Penn Central’s property. Additionally, a significant public interest in light space was furthered by regulation which prohibits the development of airspace above the terminal.

**Categorical / Per Se Takings**

**CASES**: *PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robin*s (1980), *Loretto v. Teleprompter* (1982), *Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council* (1992)

PER SE TAKINGS

1. Any permanent physical invasion of property constitutes a taking *(Loretto);*
2. A complete deprivation of all economically viable use of property interest constitutes a taking, unless background principles of nuisance and property law independently restrict the owner’s intended use of the property (*Lucas*)
3. Right to exclude arbitrarily exists, even where a business is open to the public. But statutes may take basis for exclusion off the table – this does not constitute a taking *(PruneYard)*

REGULATIONS: Generally considered a per se taking when it forces landowners to endure a permanent physical occupation on their land. Some states require compensation if value is reduced by a specific percentage.

*PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins* (1980): **PHYSICAL INVASIONS**

Rule: Restricting the right to exclude is not a taking. In making a determination on whether a taking has occurred, courts look to the character of the governmental action and the economic impact of the restriction in terms of the investment-backed rate of return of the owner.

Facts: While *Lloyd* barred free speech claims in malls, Cali court held there is a right to distribute literature in malls protected by state constitution. Students sought to solicit support for their opposition to a UN resolution against Zionism. Mall excludes them. Cali court upholds their right to protest there without being excluded.

Holding: Since the government’s enforcement of the students’ speech rights is important and bc it does not impair the economic value of PruneYard’s business, does not amount to a taking. (Though one of the essential “sticks” in the bundle of property rights is the right to exclude, and though there was a literal taking of this right, not every destruction or injury to property is a taking.)

Concurrence, Marshall: PruneYard’s claim is that common law rights such as trespass may not be altered by the government. Such a claim would impede legislative progress as it would allow no room for improvement in the common law.

Concurrence, Powell: Although it is true that the government may not force a private individual to provide a platform for a belief he does not hold, there is no way that patrons of PruneYard would attribute the views/statements of the students to PruneYard/owner.

*Loretto v. Teleprompter* (1982): **PERMANENT** **PHYSICAL INVASIONS**

Rule: A minor but permanent physical occupation of an owner’s property authorized by government constitutes a “taking” of property for which just compensation is due under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments - without regard to the public interests that it may serve or the fact that it only has a minimal economic impact on the property owner.

Facts: NY law requires landlords to allow cable TV company to install cable facilities through property. Loretto discovers cable after purchasing building, alleging it was an unconstitutional taking without just compensation. Holding: Taking.

Dissent, Blackmun: Difficult to distinguish “temporary” physical occupations whose constitutionality is subject to a rigid balancing process, and “permanent” physical occupations which are held to be takings without regard to other factors that a court might ordinarily examine. Majority errs in attempting to distinguish between a “permanent occupation” and a “temporary invasion.”

*Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council*: **COMPLETE DEPRIVATION OF ECONOMIC USE - NEW RULE**

Rule: When a state regulation deprives private property of all economic value, that regulation constitutes a taking and the owner of the property must be paid just compensation. An exception to this rule, however, exists for economic uses of private property not originally contemplated by the owner’s title or property rights when acquiring the property. In enacting this rule, there is also a prohibition on “noxious uses” of property found in the common law of nuisances.

Facts: Lucas buys two beachfront lots. Has hired an architect but had not started building yet. Multiple residents lived nearby. Beachfront management act comes down: he cannot build houses on it. Property has now been rendered economically useless.

Holding: Taking. The regulation completely deprives the property of all economic value, and he is thus entitled to just compensation.

Dissent, Stevens: This is just trading one hard to apply, arbitrary results test for another.

Dissent, Blackmun: Majority is unnecessarily broad opinion that ignores limits of jurisdiction and precedent, and creates a new categorical rule and exception, to decide a relatively simple/narrow question of law. Only question for review is whether the legislature has a rational reason for enacting the Act to address an issue affecting the public good. If so, this finding is entitled to great deference and Lucas is not entitled to payment of just compensation.

Note: Precedent invalidates 2 categories of regulations that go “too far”: (1) regulations that compel a property owner to suffer physical “invasion” on his property and (2) regulations that deny all economically beneficial or productive uses of land. However, the application of the second category is troubling because there has never been an outline justified for this category of takings.

**Deprivation of Core Property Rights**

Parents can disinherit children, but every state provides some protection for surviving spouses.

**Statutory forced share statutes** - Most states allow a surviving spouse to reject the will and recover a set portion of the decedent’s estate. Many states also protect right of a surviving spouse to continue living in the marital homestead. Other states provide for joint ownership of property acquired during marriage and give surviving spouse half the community property acquired during the marriage.

**Intestacy statute** - Property of those who die without a valid will is distributed to decedent’s heirs. Some laws divide the property between surviving spouse and children, while others leave everything to spouse. If no spouse or children, other relatives entitled.

**Escheat** - If no heirs, property escheats to the state. Could the state completely abolish the power to pass on one’s property at death?

*Babbitt v. Youpee* (1997): **ACTS OF REPAIR**

Rule: If the extraordinary character of a regulation is such that it denies a landowner certain fundamental property rights such as the devise and descent of his land, the regulation amounts to a taking of property without just compensation.

Facts: Growing problem caused by an Indian land allotment policy that resulted in parcels of Indian land becoming fractionated, with individual parcels held by dozens of owners. Congress passed a regulation (Indian Land Consolidation Act, 1984) designed to improve problem: instead of passing in a fractionated manner to heirs, fractional interests in land would automatically escheat to the Tribe. Made no provision of compensation to those holding the property interests. *Hodel v. Irving* (US 1987) invalidated this section as a taking of private property without just compensation in violation of 5th A. Subsequently, Congress amended regulation to permit the devise of a previously escheatable interest, but only to another already-owner of a fractional interest in the same parcel.

* Youpees are children/potential heirs of member of Sioux/Assiniboine Tribes. William died testate and devised each interest in land to a single child. Under amended regulation, Youpees’ interests would escheat to Tribe because none of them owned another fractional interest in any of the parcels William was devising to them. Claimed a taking without just compensation.

Holding: A gov regulation (like the amended ILCA) restricting a landowner’s ability to devise land as he wishes constitutes a taking without just compensation. Through amendment to the regulation, all Congress did was create a small class of individuals that could receive fractional interests; insufficient to overcome the restriction on the right of alienation that the amendment still imposes.

Dissent, Stevens: Gov has a legitimate interest in providing for productive land development. Amended regulation does this by reducing the fractionation of Indian lands to allow for development. William had notice of this regulation, and could have conferred the property in a dif way (selling the property, gifting, putting in trust for children). This situation is a product of inadequate legal advice, rather than an unconstitutional defect in the statute.

Summary and Reparations

* *Pierson*: People who felt they had lost something they deserved, which had been wrongfully taken from them.
* Can take any of our cases this semester, run a chain of title, and go back to that moment of finding the fox.
* *Lobatto*: Custom and usage.
* GDP in America was based on ownership of human beings and land.
* Life estates preserving wealth.
* Covenants: Land sold to developer who turns it into real estate development.
* In sum, entitlements don’t function independently, but blur together to function as ownership.
* What happens next? How has Congress endeavored to make good on the promise of compensation?
* Pros and cons are of proposing reparations through takings claim:
* What would it mean to have a strategy based on legitimizing past conception of people as property? Using American property law - the source of the problems - to fix the problems might be perverse. Can we talk about personhood as something that can be taken (Radin)? Alternatively, you can frame it in terms of Locke - the fruits of enslaved people’s labor.
