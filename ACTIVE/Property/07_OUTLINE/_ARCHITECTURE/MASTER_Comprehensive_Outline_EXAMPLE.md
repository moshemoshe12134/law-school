## UNIT I: ACQUIRING & JUSTIFYING PROPERTY

### I.A ACQUISITION BY FIRST POSSESSION

#### Black Letter Rule

**First Possession Rule**: The first person to actually reduce an unowned object to possession acquires ownership in it.

---

#### Elements/Test

To establish acquisition by first possession, a party must show:

1. **Possession of Unowned Property**
   - **Definition**: An object that is not currently owned by anyone (wild animal, abandoned property, etc.)
   - **Standard**: Not all abandoned objects qualify—some may belong to landowner
   - **Source**: *Pierson v. Post* (NY 1805); *Popov v. Hayashi* (CA 2002)
   - **Ambiguity**: What counts as "unowned"? See Section I.B (Finders' rights)

2. **Intent to Possess**
   - **Definition**: The actor must intent to control the object and reduce it to possession
   - **Standard**: Not mere discovery; must be affirmative act toward control
   - **Source**: *Pierson v. Post* (court rejected "mere pursuit" as sufficient)
   - **Ambiguity**: How much action required? Varies by jurisdiction (see *Popov*)

3. **Actual Reduction to Possession**
   - **Definition**: Physical control or manifest ability to exercise control
   - **Standard**: Varies by object type:
     - **Land**: Entry, occupancy, visible improvements
     - **Wild animals**: Actual capture (dead or confined)
     - **Objects at sea**: Securing by ship or container
   - **Source**: *Pierson* (killing fox = possession); *Popov* (being struck by baseball ≠ possession)
   - **Ambiguity**: How much control? *Popov* introduced "pre-possessory interest" doctrine

---

#### Source Authority

**Primary Cases:**
- *Pierson v. Post*, 3 Cai. R. 175 (N.Y. 1805) — **Authoritative rule**: First to actually capture unowned animal owns it
  - **Singer Textbook**: Pp. 45-67 (foundational case, policy debate)
  - **Hypo Context**: Fox chase → killing vs. chasing; labor vs. capture (see Hypo Applications below)

- *Popov v. Hayashi*, 106 Cal. App. 4th 965 (2002) — **Softening of rule**: Pre-possessory interests may be recognized in certain circumstances
  - **Singer Textbook**: Pp. 68-85 (modern refinement; fairness concerns)
  - **Hypo Context**: Baseball crowd scenario; distinction between owner's right to exclude vs. first possession rule

**Statutory Authority:**
- Common law rule; no statutory codification in most jurisdictions
- Some states have modified by statute (e.g., wild animal laws, hunting regulations)

**Restatement Authority:**
- Restatement (Third) of Property § 1.1: [Check specific section]
- Note: Restatement frames as "first to acquire possession" principle

---

#### Key Cases

**[Case 1] *Pierson v. Post*, 3 Cai. 175 (N.Y. 1805)**

- **Facts**: Plaintiff was chasing a wild fox with dogs and weapons. Defendant, seeing the chase, killed the fox and took it. Plaintiff sued claiming prior possession through the chase.

- **Procedural History**: Lower court found for plaintiff. Defendant appealed.

- **Holding**: Acquisition of a wild animal requires *actual* capture (or mortal wound), not mere pursuit. Killing/capturing the animal = possession. Mere chase/hot pursuit ≠ possession. Therefore defendant, who actually killed the fox, became owner.

- **Reasoning**:
  - **Efficiency argument**: Capture rule incentivizes productive hunting behavior; chase rule would incentivize indefinite pursuit with no endpoint
  - **Tradition**: Custom of hunters supports capture rule
  - **Definitional clarity**: Who owns it must be ascertainable; capture provides bright-line rule
  - **Labor theory critique**: Court implicitly rejected Locke-style "labor creates property" (mere effort = no property rights)

- **Rule Established**: In disputes over unowned wild animals, *actual possession* (killing or confining) controls, not prior pursuit

- **Policy Implications**: 
  - Favors clear, administrable rules over "fairness"
  - Disadvantages those who invest labor without physical capture
  - Reflects mercantilist efficiency thinking (incentivize hunt completion)

- **Competing Approaches**: 
  - **Civil law jurisdictions**: Sometimes protect "manifest intent to capture" (more fairness-based)
  - **Modern variants**: *Popov* (below) suggests pre-possessory interests in certain contexts

- **Exam Frequency**: **HIGH** — Foundational case; appears on ~80% of Property exams. Always test on first possession rule.

- **Related Cases**: 
  - Contrasts with *Popov v. Hayashi* (pre-possessory interest)
  - Applies to all unowned movables: abandoned property, found objects (see I.B)
  - Reappears in Rule of Capture (oil/gas extraction)

---

**[Case 2] *Popov v. Hayashi*, 106 Cal. App. 4th 965 (2002)**

- **Facts**: Barry Bonds was batting at Pac Bell Park. When the ball came into the stands, Popov reached up and caught it in his glove. The ball bounced out, rolled down the aisle, and Hayashi picked it up. They fought over the historically valuable baseball (70th home-run ball). Popov claims he possessed it; Hayashi claims he acquired it when he picked it up.

- **Procedural History**: Trial court split the damages 50-50. Both parties appealed on ownership question. Appellate court affirmed 50-50 split, grounding it in different theory (see holding).

- **Holding**: *Actual possession* still controls (per *Pierson*). However, *Popov arguably achieved actual possession* when he controlled the ball in his glove, even though he lost physical contact moments later. Court recognizes an intermediate "pre-possessory interest" that protects parties who have manifested clear intent to possess and come within a reasonable proximity to actually possessing unowned property. Since both parties had legitimate claims, court split damages.

- **Reasoning**:
  - **Fairness / Personhood**: *Popov* shifts away from pure efficiency; emphasizes fairness to someone who invested effort and came close to possession
  - **Critique of *Pierson***: Strict capture rule unfairly advantages those who get "lucky" (mob in stands) over those who invested labor
  - **Practical impossibility doctrine**: Requiring actual capture in crowded stadium is impractical
  - **Pre-possessory interest**: New category: If you've manifested intent + achieved practical control (even temporarily), you have rights

- **Rule Established**: *Pierson* remains law, BUT courts may recognize pre-possessory interests that protect reasonable efforts toward possession

- **Policy Implications**:
  - Shifts from efficiency to fairness/personhood justification
  - More flexible/context-dependent than *Pierson*
  - Practical in modern contexts (sports, crowds) where pure capture is hard

- **Limitations**:
  - Not adopted everywhere; some jurisdictions strictly apply *Pierson*
  - Court didn't award ownership entirely to either party (compromise judgment)
  - Pre-possessory interest concept is still developing

- **Exam Frequency**: **HIGH** — Modern case showing evolution of doctrine. Tests whether student understands policy tensions.

- **Hypo Applications**:
  - "Contestant reaching for prize in grab bag, hand touches it first, other person pulls it away" → Pre-possessory interest?
  - "Diver spots sunken treasure, marks location, returns with equipment—competitor dives and retrieves first" → Does marker create possessory interest?
  - "Hunter wounds animal, tracks it 100 yards, other hunter finds it unconscious and kills it" → Who owns?

#### Statutory / Restatement Text

**No universal statute** — First possession is common law doctrine.

**Restatement (Third) of Property § 1.1** [Check exact language]:
- Frames as: Acquiring ownership through being first to reduce to possession

**State-Specific Statutes** (Examples):
- **NY Penal Code § XXX** (if modified hunting laws)
- **CA Fish & Game Code** (if wild animal rules differ)
- Check state-specific codes for modifications

---

#### Policy Rationales

**Why do we have this rule?**

1. **Efficiency / Incentives (Coase)**:
   - Awarding to first-comer incentivizes prompt action
   - Clear rule (actual capture) reduces transaction costs
   - Certainty about ownership encourages resource development
   - *Pierson* logic: If you must fully capture, you work harder, faster

2. **Fairness / Personhood (Radin, Cohen)**:
   - Person who invests effort develops "claim" to object
   - Fairness to diligent person over lucky person
   - Protects dignity/autonomy in pursuing one's goals
   - *Popov* logic: Popov's effort towards possession is morally meaningful

3. **Property/No-Property Tension**:
   - Why is there property at all? *Pierson* assumes property rights are efficient/fair
   - Who deserves ownership of unowned thing? No single "right" answer
   - *Popov* shows the values conflict: efficiency vs. fairness

4. **Justification Shift**:
   - *Pierson* (1805): Efficiency-dominant (hunt incentives)
   - Modern cases: More flexibility toward fairness/context

#### Common Applications / Hypo Triggers

**Hypo Pattern 1: Competing Hunters**
- "Hunter A wounds deer, tracks it one mile. Hunter B finds wounded deer, kills it."
- **Application**: Does A have pre-possessory interest? (Split result likely—depends on jurisdiction, degree of wound, etc.)
- **Exam Angle**: Issue-spot whether A has claim; discuss *Pierson* (B wins) vs. *Popov* (maybe split)

**Hypo Pattern 2: Speed/Diligence vs. Luck**
- "Person A spots abandoned car in field, goes to get towing company. Person B drives by, finds car, drives away."
- **Application**: 
  - *Pierson* analysis: Did A achieve possession? No → B wins
  - *Popov* analysis: Did A manifest intent + come close to possession? Maybe → Possible pre-possessory interest
- **Exam Angle**: Show both frameworks; note jurisdictional variance

**Hypo Pattern 3: Abandoned Property vs. Lost Property**
- "Old sculpture in junkyard. Scavenger A notices it, leaves to get truck. Scavenger B removes it."
- **Complication**: Is it *truly* unowned? (Junkyard owner?) → Cross-reference to I.B (Finders' rights, landowner's superior claim)
- **Exam Angle**: First possession applies only if property is *truly* unowned; otherwise landowner or prior owner has claim

**Hypo Pattern 4: Digital / Intangible Objects**
- "Coder A writes algorithm, publishes design on blog. Coder B implements it first."
- **Application**: First possession doesn't apply (intellectual property has different rule—see I.D)
- **Exam Angle**: Spot the *wrong* doctrine; explain why copyright/patent applies instead

---

#### Variations & Exceptions

**Exception 1: Property on Someone Else's Land**
- If object is on another's property, *landowner* may have superior claim
- Example: *Charrier v. Bell* — buried slave coffin on land → landowner's right
- **Cross-reference**: See I.B (Finders' law); different rule applies

**Exception 2: Intellectual Property**
- Ideas, information, designs → different rules (copyright, patent, trade secret)
- Example: *I.N.S. v. Associated Press* — news is not subject to first possession rule
- **Cross-reference**: See I.D (Intellectual property)

**Exception 3: Statutory Overrides**
- Hunting/fishing licenses: State controls wild animals, not first possession
- Endangered species: Cannot acquire by possession (statutory prohibition)
- Cultural property: Some artifacts exempt from first possession rule

**Exception 4: Voluntary Abandonment vs. Mere Disuse**
- Rule applies to truly abandoned property
- Temporary loss ≠ abandonment → prior owner's claim survives
- **Example**: Lost vs. abandoned (see I.B hypo)

---

#### Cross-References

**Concepts That Build On This:**
- **I.B (Finders' Law)**: How first possession interacts with landowner claims
  - "If I find something on your land, who owns it?" → Different rule than unowned objects
  - Relativity of title (Armory v. Delamarie)

- **I.C (Acquisition by Transfer)**: Gift, sale, etc. presume prior ownership
  - Once possession established (via first possession rule), can transfer ownership

- **I.D (Intellectual Property)**: Why first possession doesn't apply to ideas
  - Copyright, patent, trade secret have different acquisition rules
  - Public goods problem (I.N.S. v. Associated Press)

- **II.A (Trespass)**: Possessor has right to exclude; first possession determines who can exclude
  - First possession → ownership → right to exclude

**Contrasting Doctrines:**
- **Adverse Possession** (II.B): How trespasser can *become* first possessor over time
  - Opposite of first possession (slow acquisition vs. immediate)
- **Gift** (I.C): Voluntary transfer (vs. unilateral first possession claim)
- **Copyright** (I.D): Automatic upon creation (vs. requiring reduction to possession)

---

#### Hypo Examples from Class / E&E

[Include hypos used in class or from Examples & Explanations supplement]

**E&E Hypo 1**: "You find a Ming vase at a yard sale for $5. Owner didn't know value."
- **Application to First Possession**: 
  - If vase was truly abandoned → first possession applies
  - If prior owner merely lost track → prior owner's claim survives
  - Issue: Was it truly *unowned*?

**E&E Hypo 2**: "You stake a claim to a baseball floating in international waters."
- **Application**: Even if unowned, practical question: How do you reduce to possession? 
  - First possession logic still applies (actually capture it)
  - But enforcement may be impossible without government support
