## 🤔 DECIDE (Next 24 Hours)

### Question: Am I ready to commit?

**Required commitment:**
- [ ] 6 weeks of work
- [ ] 2-3 hours per day, 5 days/week
- [ ] ~60 hours total
- [ ] Starting next week (Jan 19)

**If YES → Go to "START BUILDING" section below**

**If MAYBE → Read more context:**
- Read `OUTLINE_ARCHITECTURE.md` (full specs)
- Read `ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md` (visual diagrams)
- Then decide

**If NO → That's okay:**
- You can still use existing outlines as-is
- But you'll have conflicts and no verification
- Come back to this architecture when you're ready

## 🆘 IF YOU GET STUCK

### "I don't know which outline's version of Rule X is right"
→ Check Singer textbook
→ Whichever version Singer uses is "right"
→ Note other version in "Variations" section
→ No single right answer? Note as ambiguity

### "I can't find a case in Singer"
→ Check E&E supplement
→ Check past exams
→ If not there → Mark as "supplemental reference"

### "I don't know how to phrase the rule"
→ Copy structure from MASTER_Comprehensive_Outline_EXAMPLE.md
→ Use Singer's language where possible
→ Ask yourself: "Can I explain this in 1 sentence?"

### "I'm running behind schedule"
→ Skip Phases 3 + 5 for now (do them post-exam)
→ Focus on Phases 1, 2, 4 (Registry, Comprehensive, Attack)
→ Can add Case Libraries + Crosswalk later

### "I don't understand a doctrine"
→ Read Singer's chapter on it (even if long)
→ Read all 6 outlines' versions (see different approaches)
→ Write down your confusion
→ Move on (you'll understand as you write)

---

## 💪 MOTIVATION

### Why do this?
- **ONE** outline instead of 6 conflicting ones
- **VERIFIED** every case against textbook (not orphaned)
- **COMPLETE** policy context + hypo applications
- **EXAM-READY** attack outline printable in one week
- **MAINTAINABLE** easy to update as you take more classes

### Time calculation
- 60 hours of work
- 15 hours/week × 4 weeks
- 3 hours/day × 5 days/week
- **That's realistic.** You can do it.

### Payoff
- Best outline you've ever created
- Foundation for exam excellence
- Model for how to consolidate complex info
- Skill you'll use in law practice

## 📱 YOUR TOOLKIT (Keep These Handy)

1. **ONE_PAGER.md** — Print and post
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md** — Reference weekly
