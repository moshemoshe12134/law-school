## ADVANTAGES OVER CURRENT SYSTEM

| Aspect | Current (6 Outlines) | New Architecture |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Single source of truth** | No (conflicting versions) | Yes (1 Master Outline) |
| **Case verification** | No (cases mentioned but not sourced) | Yes (every case traced to textbook page) |
| **Policy context** | Spotty (some outlines include, others don't) | Comprehensive (every doctrine explained) |
| **Exam preparation** | Manual (hard to identify high-yield) | Systematic (Registry marks frequency) |
| **Cross-referencing** | Limited (isolated outlines) | Complete (everything links) |
| **Finding information** | Slow (search 6 outlines) | Fast (<1 minute by topic) |
| **Maintaining** | Hard (multiple versions to sync) | Easy (1 source + links) |
| **Hypo applications** | Some examples scattered | Organized by doctrine |

---

## TIME INVESTMENT VS. PAYOFF

### Time Cost
- Reading architecture docs: 1.5-3.5 hours (one-time)
- Building system: ~60 hours over 6 weeks (2-3 hrs/day)
- Maintenance: ~30 min/week during semester

### Payoff
- ✓ One consolidated outline (not 6 conflicting)
- ✓ Every claim verifiable against textbook
- ✓ High-yield cases clearly marked
- ✓ Exam-day checklist ready to print
- ✓ Deep study resource (Comprehensive + Cases)
- ✓ Easy to maintain + update weekly
- ✓ Foundation for excellent exam preparation

**Total investment**: ~80-100 hours = ~$2,000-3,000 value (if hiring tutor)
