---

## Detailed Autonomous Workflow

### PHASE 1: Registry Extraction (Autonomous)

**I will:**

1. **Read all 6 outlines** using the Read tool
   - Extract every case mention
   - Note citations, jurisdictions, years

2. **Create master case list**
   - Deduplicate (same case in multiple outlines)
   - Alphabetize
   - Count how many outlines mention each case

3. **Find in textbook**
   - Use search/index to locate each case
   - Record page numbers
   - Flag any cases NOT in textbook

4. **Analyze past exams** (in `02_SOURCES/exams_raw/`)
   - Scan all 14 exams
   - Count case mentions
   - Mark HIGH (4+ appearances), MEDIUM (1-3), LOW (0-1)

5. **Tag with topics**
   - Read case context in outlines
   - Assign to Units (I-V) and sub-topics
   - Note if case spans multiple topics

6. **Create `_REGISTRY_Cases.md`**
   - Alphabetical index with all metadata
   - Topic index
   - Notes column

**Output**: Complete registry file

**Your QC**: 15-minute review (Checkpoint 1)

---

### PHASE 2: Doctrine Consolidation (Autonomous)

**For each of 30-40 doctrines, I will:**

1. **Read all 6 outlines' versions**
   - Extract how each explains the doctrine
   - Note agreements and disagreements
   - Identify which outlines are more detailed

2. **Read textbook section**
   - Find relevant pages in Singer
   - Note Singer's approach
   - Extract policy rationales
   - Find case discussions

3. **Resolve conflicts**
   - If outlines disagree → Check textbook
   - If textbook unclear → Check actual cases
   - If still unclear → Note as "Split authority"
   - Document my reasoning

4. **Write unified section**
   - Black Letter Rule (one sentence)
   - Elements/Test (numbered, defined)
   - Source Authority (cases → Registry, statutes, Restatement)
   - Key Cases (2-3 most important, with facts + holding)
   - Statutory/Restatement Text
   - Policy Rationales
   - Common Applications (hypo triggers)
   - Variations & Exceptions
   - Cross-References

5. **Link everything**
   - Link cases to Registry
   - Link cross-references to other sections
   - Note related case library files (to be created in Phase 3)

**Output**: Complete `MASTER_Comprehensive_Outline.md` (40-50 pages)

**Your QC**: 30-minute sample review (Checkpoint 2) → I proceed with rest

---

### PHASE 3: Case Libraries (Autonomous)

**I will:**

1. **Identify high-yield cases**
   - From Registry (HIGH + MEDIUM frequency)
   - Should be ~50-60 cases

2. **For each high-yield case:**
   - Extract from outlines that have detailed write-ups
   - Supplement with textbook
   - If neither is sufficient → Note "needs manual review"
   - Format using case brief template

3. **Organize by Unit**
   - Create 5 files: `_CASES_UnitI_Acquiring.md`, `_CASES_UnitII_Exclude.md`, etc.
   - All cases for that Unit in one file
   - Alphabetical within each file

4. **Link to Comprehensive Outline**
   - Add links from doctrine sections to case briefs
   - Link case briefs back to Registry

**Output**: 5 case library files with ~50-60 detailed case briefs

**Your QC**: 15-minute sample review (Checkpoint 3)

---

### PHASE 4: Attack Outline (Autonomous)

**I will:**

1. **Condense each doctrine**
   - Extract: Rule (1 sentence) + Elements (list) + Case names + Statute #'s + Hypo triggers
   - Delete: Policy details, verbose case facts, extended explanations

2. **Create tiered structure**
   - **Part 1**: HIGH-YIELD (top 15-20 doctrines, 0.5-1 page each)
   - **Part 2**: MEDIUM-YIELD (remaining doctrines, 0.25-0.5 page each)
   - **Part 3**: QUICK REFERENCE (case list, statute numbers)

3. **Format for printing**
   - Compact layout
   - Clear hierarchy
   - Easy to scan
   - Page numbers in TOC

4. **Insert hypo triggers**
   - From Comprehensive Outline's "Applications" sections
   - Add exam tips where relevant

**Output**: `MASTER_Attack_Outline.md` (15-25 pages)

**Your QC**: 30-minute review (Checkpoint 4)

---

### PHASE 5: Validation & Crosswalk (Autonomous)

**I will:**

1. **Link validation**
   - Test 20% random links (automated if possible, manual spot-check)
   - Fix any broken links
   - Ensure all cross-references point to existing sections

2. **Create `_SOURCE_CROSSWALK.md`**
   - Map each Unit → textbook chapters → page ranges
   - List main cases per topic
   - Create validation table

3. **Completeness check**
   - [ ] All 30-40 doctrines covered
   - [ ] All high-yield cases have briefs
   - [ ] All cases in Registry
   - [ ] All links work
   - [ ] No placeholders

**Output**: Validated system + source crosswalk

**Your QC**: 30-minute final review (Checkpoint 5)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Provide Context (Do this now)

Please answer:

1. **Syllabus**: What Units/topics will you cover this semester?
   - [ ] I'll upload my syllabus
   - [ ] No syllabus, but here are the topics: ___________
   - [ ] Not sure yet, we're figuring it out

2. **Textbook**: Singer, Berger & Davidson 8th edition? Yes/No
   - If no: What edition/author?

3. **Professor's Style** (brief):
   - Policy-heavy? Black-letter focused? Economic analysis?
   - Any particular emphasis?

4. **Exam Format**:
   - Open/closed book?
   - Essay/Multiple choice/both?
   - Any past exams I should look at?

5. **Timeline**: When is your exam? _________
   - How soon do you need this? _________

### Step 2: I'll Start Phase 1

After you provide context, I'll:
1. Read all 6 outlines
2. Extract all cases
3. Create Registry
4. Present for your QC (Checkpoint 1)

### Step 3: Review & Approve

You review Registry (15 min) → I proceed to Phase 2

## Why This Works

**My Advantages:**
- Can read 6 outlines simultaneously
- Can cross-reference textbook systematically
- Can maintain consistency across 40 doctrines
- Can validate all links without getting bored
- Don't tire, don't procrastinate

**Your Advantages:**
- Only spend time on high-value QC decisions
- Can course-correct at any checkpoint
- Provide domain expertise (professor's style, exam format)
- End up with same quality deliverable

**Result**: Professional-grade outline with minimal time investment from you

---

## Risk Mitigation

**What if you don't like what I produce?**

At any checkpoint, you can:
- Request adjustments (I'll revise)
- Change approach (I'll adapt)
- Pause and provide more feedback
- Even stop if it's not working (no hard feelings)

**What if I make mistakes?**

That's why we have checkpoints! You'll catch:
- Wrong rule statements
- Missing cases
- Bad tone/depth
- Formatting issues

**What if your professor does things differently?**

You tell me at Checkpoint 2 (doctrine samples):
- "My professor emphasizes X more"
- "We didn't cover case Y"
- "Professor hates this approach"

I'll adjust and re-do.
