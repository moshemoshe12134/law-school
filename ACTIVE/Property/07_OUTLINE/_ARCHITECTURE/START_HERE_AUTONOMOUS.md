# QUICK START - AUTONOMOUS MODE
## 90% AI-Driven, 10% Quality Control

---

## Read This First (2 minutes)

**The deal**: I do 90% of the work autonomously. You only do quality control at 5 checkpoints.

**Your time**: ~3 hours total (spread over 1-2 weeks)
**My time**: ~20 hours of autonomous work

**What you get**: Same professional-grade outline system, but without 100 hours of manual labor

## Step 2: I Start Working (Autonomous)

Once you provide the context above, I'll:

**Phase 1** (takes me ~1 day of autonomous work):
1. Read all 6 outlines
2. Extract every case mention
3. Find page numbers in textbook
4. Analyze past exams for frequency
5. Tag with topics
6. Create `_REGISTRY_Cases.md`

Then I'll present it for your review (Checkpoint 1).

## What I Need From You Right Now

**Just answer the 5 questions above.** That's it.

You can:
- Type your answers directly in a response to me
- Upload a syllabus if you have one
- Give me brief bullet points (doesn't need to be perfect)

**I'll handle the rest.**

## Questions Before We Start?

Feel free to ask:
- "Will this actually work?" (Yes, I can do 90% autonomously)
- "What if I don't like what you produce?" (You'll catch it at QC checkpoints)
- "Can I pause/stop anytime?" (Yes, no commitment)
- "How do I know you're doing it right?" (That's what QC checkpoints are for)

## Ready?

**Your move**: Answer the 5 context questions (15 minutes)

**My move**: Start building autonomously, present Registry for review

**Result**: Complete outline system in 1-2 weeks with only 3 hours of your time
