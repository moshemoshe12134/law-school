## KEY RULES

1. **Start with Registry** (Phase 1 first) — everything else depends on it
2. **Link religiously** — Every case → Registry; Every Registry entry → Textbook page
3. **Consolidate ruthlessly** — ONE outline, not 6 merged together
4. **Validate constantly** — "Can I find this in Singer?"
5. **Prioritize high-yield** — Mark exam-frequent cases; memorize those 25 first
