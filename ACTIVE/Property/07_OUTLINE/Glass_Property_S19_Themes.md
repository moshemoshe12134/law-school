# Common policy arguments in property law

1. **Rights:** rights arguments appeal to fairness or justice in social relationships, rights are relative in relation to those that you engage with. Will need to make value judgements to determine which interests are legitimate and which should prevail when have competing legitimate interests
   1. **Freedom of action:** right for one to use their property as they wish v. **Right of security**: right to have one’s property protected from harm
      1. **Eliff & Rule of capture**: one has right to drill beneath their land into the common oil beneath the land, but must make sure not to do so unreasonably so as to damage the property rights of others
      2. **ADA and civil rights:** people should be protected against discrimination, but need to balance it against the rights of land owners and what they want to do with their property (similar idea)
      3. **Nuisance:** the entire doctrine is centered around this idea: when does the use of one’s property constitute and unreasonable interference with the security of use of someone else’s.
         * Surface water: common enemy v. natural flow rule is the most striking example of this tension
      4. **Easements:** controlling the intensity of use that one puts an easement to, tension between freedom of action and the right of security to the grantor; same with kind of use—should it be broader or narrower?
      5. **Estates—presumption against forfeiture:** if in doubt, assume no future estate—allows one to do with property as they see fit
         * Minority of courts seek to further the intent of the parties as their priority—that one has a right to make sure their property interest is secure
      6. **Estates—Doctrine against waste:** life tenant can do with property as he wishes, but must not do damage to the property; if he does—will revert back to fee simple owner, who can use the property as it should be
      7. **Covenants—unreasonable restraint on alienation:** right of people to sell their property over the right of the developer to have absolute control to further the goals of his development
      8. **Developer control of common interest developments:** even when kept right to amend restrictive covenant, can only do so reasonably-freedom of selling v. freedom to ensure get return on investment
      9. **Cy pres doctrine:** traditional rule that needed to prove general charitable intent, today assume meant general charitable intent—debate if sacrificing the security of ones gift for public good (action) or if fulfilling what the grantor would have wanted with his property
      10. **Fair housing:** increases ability to sell property (no pressure not to sell to race) & lets people enjoy right of housing, counter is that restricts ones right to exclude and do with their property as they see fit
      11. **Fair housing- sexual harassment:** perhaps should lower the bar for finding harassment claim in housing context, people have right to feel safe in their home.
      12. **Diliddo:** LL couldn’t discriminate against tenant with subsidized housing lease and had to conform w/ the terms set by the agency. Balance between his property right and allowing those to find a place to stay
      13. **Eminent Domain:** need to give the government the power it needs to make sure that society can prosper- look out for the general welfare. But, also need to protect the rights of the people whose property is being taken.
          * **Kelo:** majority said that taking property for benefit of public was justified, dissent said that only when the property itself is causing harm—otherwise the person should be protected (public use is only to prevent or fix a public harm)
          * **Regulatory taking:** question of how much one person should have to bear for the benefit of the community at large—others have right to be protected from possible harms from owners property, but to what extent?
            + Was it a large diminution of value? Did he invest? What is the government’s purpose?
   2. **Settled expectations and reliance interest:** (some overlaps with efficiency)
      1. **Bentham**: Property is nothing but a basis of expectation- the expectation of deriving certain advantages from a thing which we are said to possess.
      2. **Rule of possession and presumption of ownership:** creates stability, people can expect what their positions will be moving forward
      3. **State v. Shack:** entered into long-term relationship with the owner of the field, **reliance** interest created and would be unfair for landlord to take advantage of that reliance
      4. **Adverse possession:** began to rely on the property, shouldn’t be taken away
      5. **Public function doctrine:** people rely on that they will be able to exert their freedoms in public, that right should be protected
      6. **Easement by estoppel:** relied on the use of that easement and would be unjust to allow the owner to remove you
      7. **Developer control of common interest developments:** even when kept right to amend restrictive covenant, can only do so reasonably (also clear balance of freedom of action and right to security). Some courts allow unilateral changes if kept right to amend
      8. **Prior-nonconforming use:** grandfather in uses before zoning was changed in order so that people can get their return on investment (same idea with **Vested rights)**
      9. **Tenancy by entirety:** limited reach of debtors on this property, don’t want to upend family that can be taken off guard by one spouse’s decision (personhood interest here as well)
      10. Sullivan—**house splitting after breaking up**: stayed in the relationship in part due to relying on that would become part owner of the home and gave up job opportunities and did homemaking to remain in the relationship in reliance on being part owner of home
      11. **Duty to mitigate:** LL tenant relationship more like k, protect the settled expectations of the parties. Also seen with **warranty of habitability and dependency of covenants. Also, LL consent** clauses in commercial context
      12. **Fair housing:** people had settled expectations of living in certain areas, with the passage of fair housing law, that would upend those relied on expectations when property was purchased
      13. **Immunity from loss:** people have relied on their property & shouldn’t be able to take away without just compensation
      14. **Lucas:** strengthens our expectation interest, really limits the legislature from regulating full diminution of value unless nuisance at common law
   3. **Equal opportunity** (& putting in work gives you right to property) v. **Distributive justice**
      1. **Labor theory of Property (Locke):** labor converts natural possessions into the property of people, gives some a right in what they produce
         * Look both to the amount of labor one puts in and the kind of labor—is it productive?
         * **Pierson v. Post:** Post pursued the fox first so could argue transferredto his possession;counter is that perhaps Post is bad hunter and want to encourage not just labor, but productive labor
         * **Eliff:** put in the work to drilling and acquire the oil through that process
         * **INS:** exerted their labor, should have a right to protect it and call it their own
         * **IP:** similar to INS, by putting in the word, make these abstract things your own (**counter**: others previously put in the work on which your work was based; should this reward simply putting in work even if not first to discover? Patent law says no)
         * **Patent:** can patent things in natural state, didn’t combine your labor w/ it
         * **Encroaching structure:** even when build structure in wrong place, it was your labor, some level of entitlement to it
         * **Should license or degree be property?** One theory is that spouse put in time and money to allow the other one to get his degree
      2. Property rights serve human values- they are recognized to that end and are limited by it”
      3. **Cohen:** anti-commodification: will only have access to the right & will have unequal bargaining power with those worse off
      4. **Magadini:** necessity defense upheld—the community has an obligation to take some responsibility for homeless people
      5. **Civil rights Acts and ADA:** meant to give those that are disadvantaged an equal opportunity to enjoy the benefits of life
      6. **Nuisance:** who should have to bear the costs, even if the activity is beneficial for society? Should developers and companies need to internalize their costs?
         * Challenge to Coase: not just about maximizing social welfare, maybe want to give entitlement to party that values it less because that is what is fair in the situation
      7. **Covenants:** Davidson supermarket case—court ruled in favor of city in order to ensure that the less off in urban cities had access to cheap and healthy food
      8. **Fair housing act:** made to limit the exclusionary zoning practices, ensure that everyone has the chance to live where they might choose
      9. **Mount Laurel Doctrine:** ensures that those with low income housing have a place to live
      10. **Duty to mitigate:** don’t want something as important as housing to remain fallow
      11. **FHA:** to ensure that everyone has access to housing
      12. **Regulatory taking:** should the community as a whole bear the loss or the specific owner? Is there reciprocity of advantage or is the owner suffering a unique harm?
   4. **Personhood theory of property:**
      1. **Radin:** spectrum between personal and fungible goods—truly personal goods are bound up with ourselves and are inalienable to an extent
      2. **Cohen:** something wrong with taking something like the human body and making it into a commodity (different spheres of value); essentialist—look at the nature of transaction, not good
      3. **IP:** very identity of a person becomes wrapped up in their creations (**counter:** part of their creations are based on others; fans wrap themselves up in popstars music also)
      4. **Moore:** human vessel should not be bought and sold like property, no right to cells
      5. **Shack:** immigrant worker had a personhood interest in their living quarters
      6. **Adverse Possession:** many times, will come to rely on the land and it will become part of you
      7. **Public trust doctrine:** some property is bound up with the public that it should be inalienable
      8. **Easement:** Labato v. Taylor**:** landowner tried to negotiate to remove those that had easements for his land, they were offended—personal connect to the land
      9. **Presumption against partition in sale:** there is a lot of sentimental value people have w/ their property, don’t want to force a sale unless absolutely necessary
      10. **License as property:** he put in all the sweat and tears, it is his and his alone
      11. **Habitable dwellings** are inalienable, that is why in State v. shack could not waive their right to access to essential services and generally courts don’t allow one to waive the implied warrant of habitability
      12. **Right to receive visitors and marry:** non-disclaimable right
      13. **Fair housing law:** is a human right, wrapped up in the person & defines us, everyone deserves it
      14. **Fair Housing exemption:** LL will a few tenants, shouldn’t be forced to live w/ those he doesn’t want to, where one lives is part of who they are, very careful to infringe on that
          * **Roommate.com:** right to exclude whoever you want when looking for a roommate
          * **City of Madison:** looking for a roommate is a market transaction (“for profit”)—can’t discriminatorily exclude
          * **Balance between market and individual focus:** more one views it wrapped up w/ individual, more one has right to exclude, to be safe from harassment & have more robust familial protections; if view as market, can’t exclude as easily, but also not necessarily entitled to other protections
      15. **Fair housing- sexual harassment:** perhaps should lower the bar for finding harassment claim in housing context, people have right to feel safe in their home.
      16. **Immunity from loss:** people become attached to their property, even with just compensation, it is immensely coercive to take someone’s home
2. **Social utility:** want to promote socially beneficial conduct. Do this by making rules that create incentives which encourage socially desirable conduct or discourage socially harmful behavior—want people to do things when the social benefit outweighs the social costs. Must project what the relative costs and benefits of alternative legal rules and how people will actually respond to them in practice
   1. **Promoting competition and development:** when the government deregulates economic activity, it allows property owners to develop their property as they see fit, promoting improvements and development. Shielding property owners from liability, for example, encourages investment in socially beneficial economic activities
   2. **Protecting the security interest of investment:** people will be less likely to invest if their investment is not secure, require legal rules to protected justified expectations. Development is important, but only reasonable development. Making developers internalize costs will encourage those activities that are socially beneficial
   3. **Examples:**
      1. **Pierson v. Post:** want to encourage people to start the chase—so perhaps should have rule of first to pursue (protect the investment); but if make the investment to secure then also stops people from being able to join the chase—perhaps leading to rule of first possession (competition)
      2. **Eliff:** want people to invest in drilling so allow everyone to drill in their land, but must drill responsibly—ensures that people will get back their investment for drilling
      3. **INS v. AP:** had to create a quasi-property right in order to protect the investment of the news agencies, but still not close of the news to the public—only right against other news agencies
      4. **Demsetz: Tragedy of the commons:** people act independently and selfishly as they consume a shared resource, spoiling the resource through their collective action. Each will try to free-ride on the other. (**INS—**if don’t protect investment, won’t gather news, and it will be underused by all)
         * Labato v. Taylor: all shared this massive property through easement, nobody was taking care of it
      5. **Elinor Ostrom:** will not always have the “tragedy of the free-rider,” don’t always need a robust private right, but rather people are intelligent enough to get together on their own to collaborate in a way that they can all benefit. When communally created and owned common property exists, often times they are more productive than nearby individual owned property systems (**condominiums, residential subdivisions**).
         * **INS:** found a way to further their interests without state involvement to some extent, banded together to collect news in a way that would help them all (issue was those that didn’t enter into the group)
         * **Jointly owned property:** people will often cooperate with each other and pool resources to achieve things they couldn’t on their own
      6. **IP:** Balance between encouraging innovation with property right and not creating a monopoly that would frustrate innovation, growth and social welfare (see: need originality in copyright and non-natural state in patent)
      7. **Rule of possession and presumption of ownership:** creates stability, people can expect what their positions will be moving forward
      8. **Finder and subsequent possessor:** creates incentives for people to find property that is not being utilized (but owner still would win against finder—protects his investment)
      9. **Adverse possession:** original owner has protection of property, but if fails to make a claim in time, fair to punish him and allow the most efficient use of the property;
         * **Bad faith trespasser:** allow in order to ensure that property used for its most efficient use
      10. **Absolute right to exclude:** generally, allow owners the absolute right to exclude, protects investment and market will control if does so unreasonably, but with common carriers—generally have a monopoly and therefore cannot trust the market, so we remove the absolute right to correct for the lack of competition
      11. **Public Functions doctrine:** similar to absolute right, these are large entities that often have monopolies in areas they function, need to ensure that people are able to express themselves, as the market cannot regulate
      12. **Nuisance:** want to promote use of land, promote development and alienability of property; but need to balance that by protecting property from unreasonable harm—nobody will invest in land if can lose its value in a second by the acts of others. Also, want to make sure promoting safe usage of land.
          * **Coase:** when transaction costs are low, markets will result in their most efficient result anyways, bright line rules will allow for certainty when investing
      13. **Easement:** allows owners to tailor the use of their land and secure expectations which will encourage investment and alienation of land
          * Useless restrictions will be thrown out—restrict action and don’t secure any investment
      14. **Easement:** want to promote people doing socially beneficial things with their land, but cannot unreasonably burden the grantor’s estate—people won’t purchase the estate; what kind of use is included? Might depend on whether favor development or security of interest
      15. **Easement by necessity:** should court allow for right of way even if was against intent of parties? Split—whether favor efficient use and development of land or security of property
      16. **Promoting alienability of property:** people should have right to burden estates and make conditions on ownership, but also want to make sure that property can be traded & used for its most efficient purpose
          * **Adverse possession:** transferring title to AP removes all the baggage from the title, promoting the alienability of property
          * **Easement appurtenant:** presumption in favor of appurtenant, because less people will have control of land and can bargain to get the right back—promoting alienability of property
          * **Estates—presumption against forfeiture:** if in doubt, assume no future estate, promotes the alienability of property
          * **Rule against creation of new estates:** want to promote alienability of property, cabin the power of one who conveys property
          * **Covenants: rule against unreasonable restraint on alienation—**can allow developers to have too much control over who can sell property to who; they do need security to protect their investment, but still doesn’t follow that they deserve control to consent who property is sold to
            + **Dissent:** developer has right to get return on investment and consent is one way to ensure that; protects other purchasers as well—this in total will encourage development of these housing projects
            + Allow governing boards to have this right if must act reasonably- democratic sub-society
          * **Leases and joint tenancy:** on one hand, promotes alienability for leases to sever joint tenancy—people will be hesitant to enter leases they can lose any time; on other hand—keeping right of survivorship will make property return to single owner and make it more easily sold
          * **Consent clauses** for subleasing in commercial leases must be exercised reasonably—otherwise unreasonable restraint on alienation
          * **FHA-** cannot be pressured not to sell to specific group-can sell to whoever you want
      17. **Covenants:** concerned that burden estates too much—touch and concern requirement ensured that property was burdened for efficiency purpose; modern trend is to be more accepting—protecting these covenants can actually promote investment in land and development
          * originally viewed as restricting development as unreasonable restraint on peoples use of their land, but modern approach have viewed them more favorably, realizing that having people’s property protected from certain land activities actually promotes development
      18. **Rezoning:** not always so simple, often must be w/n comprehensive plan and sometimes k zoning not allowed—while want to encourage development, must protect the interest of those within the zoning region
      19. **Corporations:** lead to tricky situation because allowing the controllers to have freedom of action and development isn’t necessarily in best interest of those who own the property, because the control is separated from the ownership—want to limit these agency costs
          * **Efficient market hypothesis:** don’t need to regulate to protect the property interests, the price that people pay to be part of corporation is based on all available information and if managers don’t take their interests into account, that will be reflected accordingly
          * **Property theory:** more regulation needed, focused on protecting not just rights of property owners, but third parties directly affected by the directors decisions
      20. **Duty to mitigate:** promotes efficient use of property—leaving nothing vacant and allows the tenant to move out and put his labor to more efficient uses elsewhere
          * Con: doesn’t protect security interest as much, bargained for privilege of not finding another tenant—might be less likely to rent out to those that have higher risk of leaving
      21. **Immunity from loss:** balance between protecting people’s reliance interests and promoting development/governmental action
      22. **Regulatory taking:** want to ensure that property isn’t put to use that harm the surrounding community, but also need to make sure that people feel safe with their investments & don’t fear that regulation can destroy their interest at any point
          * Courts will look for investment backed expectations when determining a regulatory taking
          * **Efficiency:** balance between government internalizing costs making sure truly a net positive and inhibiting actual productive plans from getting off the ground
3. **Rigid Rules versus Flexible Standards:** while rights and social utility appeal to substantive justice, formal considerations consider the manner in which rules are expressed or implemented (relates to **Administrability)**
   1. **Rules:** designed to allow for mechanical application- promotes certainty & restrains judicial arbitrariness. By knowing one’s rights and knowing that the judge’s discretion will be limited, citizens can adjust their behavior accordingly in a way that the state intended the rule to incentivize; sporadic legal ruling inhibit people from acting. Downside: because rules are rigid, they are necessarily over and under inclusive, and therefore essentially require official arbitrariness. If a rule is to be better than a standard, it is because it is determined that this kind of arbitrariness is better than the arbitrariness/uncertainty of a standard.
   2. **Standards:** flexible principles that can be melded for different situations—allow for obtaining justice in specific cases, considering all relevant factors. But they offer less predictability to citizen & less guidance to judges.
   3. **Summary:** Rules are predictable, allowing people to plan and induce actors to look out for their own interests knowing when the law will and won’t protect them. But they will sometimes punish productive behavior and allow nonproductive behavior. Standards allow for flexible application and the uncertainty of how the law will apply might discourage socially undesirable conduct but might encourage inaction from socially desirable behavior due to fear of how the law might apply. Finally, it is debatable whether rules are truly more predictable than standards, as courts must determine under which facts rules apply.
   4. **Examples:**
      1. **Pierson v. Post:** debate whether apply bright line rule of capture or apply standard that allows for one that truly deserves it to get it
      2. **Wilcox: Possession and presumption of title:** whoever currently possesses an item is presumed to be the owner—would be hard to administer and lead to costly litigation otherwise
      3. **Finder and Subsequent possessor:** easily administrable rule for who gets what, when
      4. **Adverse possession:** quieting title and avoiding stale claims will simple rule ensures that no wasted litigation or wasted time by purchasers checking to see what the correct title truly is
      5. **Adverse possession:** debate as to whether have objective or subjective state of mind test—subjective test might be more appropriate, but quite hard to prove one way or another
      6. **Encroaching structures:** traditional rules required one to destroy any structure that one built encroaching on another’s land and if built entirely on another’s land, gave that owner the entire building; modern approach—doctrine of relative hardship considers the costs to each party, as well as the innocence of the mistake
      7. **Right to exclude and Uston:** most courts have a rule that if not in violation of statute, allowed to exclude anyone from your premises for any reason, even when open to public—this will quickly settle all disputes, and generally market will self-regulate and won’t be issue, but don’t want to force owner to need to defend his position. Uston applies standard—otherwise very hard to ever prove discrimination, can’t allow for substantial unjust to stand
      8. **Surface water:** some apply standard nuisance reasonableness test, while others have bright line rule either allowing or disallowing one to divert any water from your property
         * But even bright line rules have rules limiting those- turning them more into a standard
      9. **Coase:** bright line rule allows for negotiations and lowers transaction costs, parties will bargain for the most efficiency result; **counter—**often will be gaps of offer and asking price and high transaction costs—standard makes sure that the correct person ends with the entitlement
      10. **Nahrstedt:** strong validity of what is put in the declaration—written documents have a lot of power and this rule allows for people to be clear about what is expected
      11. **Just compensation:** don’t inquire into actual value of resident or their asking price—need bright line rule based on market
      12. **Per Se takings:** if deprives owner of all economical use of the property or physical invasion of the property, will be ruled a taking- no matter how small the intrusion (in case of physical invasion). **Dissent-** temporary ones can be much worse- this is form over substance
4. **Judicial role and Institutional Competence:**
   1. **Judicial role:** what is the proper role of the courts as lawmakers? What is the proper division between the democratically elected legislature and the relatively illegitimate court?
   2. **Institutional competency:** how the different sphere of government go about making decisions and the advantages and disadvantages of each. Judges have less resources at their disposal and therefore are less equipped to make broad reaching rules or administer long-term remedies. On the other hand, legislatures are heavily influenced by lobbying groups and under political pressure to appeal to what is best for the majority.
      1. **Pierson v. Post:** dissent suggests differing to the **custom** of the trade, they have better ability to know what is proper AND decision will be seen as **legitimate**. **Swift and Gifford** the court deferred to the custom. Also, looked to **tradition:** what man has considered acquisition of property over course of history (positive law)
      2. **Johnson and Antelope:** exercise discretion where there are gaps/conflicts/ambiguities while respecting need for consistency with letter and spirit of pre-existing laws. Looked to the law of nations, laws by which our government and civilizations have functioned; not to abstract principles—not the role of a justice to create law
         * **Bentham:** Property and law rely on each other. Before laws were made, there was no property. Take law away & property ceases. B/c property is based on expectation, which the laws provides. (Nothing inherently belongs to anyone, all based on law)
         * **Marshall in prune yard (VERY Different than Marshall in Johnson):** property law has a normative dimension, a sphere of private autonomy that the state has to protect
         * **Bronson:** there is no natural law granting a man right in property after he dies, and his children have no natural right in inheritance
      3. **Our nation’s sad history might suggest a more active role:**
         * **Blackstone**: we are pleased w/ possession but afraid to look back to the means by which is was acquired.
         * **Baldwin**: History is something we carry with us, controls us & present in everything we do
         * **Whiteness as property** (Harris): The origins of property rights in the U.S are rooted in racial domination. Distinct forms of exploitation (Blacks & Native Americans) contributed to the construction of whiteness as property (**Davis case)**
      4. **INS v. AP:** Brandies dissent criticized the creation of this “quasi-property:” there is no law protecting it & legislature in better position to decide if one is needed
      5. **Moore:** court said didn’t have the institutional competence to make the decision as to whether or not it is a good idea for cells to be a patient’s property, consequences could be far reaching
         * Also, Cal. Statute limited control over disposal of their body tissue—indicating that one likely doesn’t own their cells (deferring to legislature)
      6. **Wilcox:** presumption of ownership with possession will be viewed as a **legitimate result**
      7. **Shack:** court stepped in and ruled on public policy grounds that workers had right to have the social workers visit them on the property—court protected them in unfair relationship
         * “Indeed, the needs of the occupants may be so imperative and their strength so weak, that the law will deny the occupants the power to contract away what is deemed essential to their health, welfare, or dignity.”
      8. **Public trust doctrine**: Juliana and Hughes court looked to what man has enjoyed for ages and considered to be common for all in natural law; other courts expanded by looking at same general features
      9. **Nuisance:** ordering a large company based on externalities is arguably not the role of the court- instead damages, allowing the company to continue operating
      10. **Nuisance**: light and air was generally not considered to be part of the nuisance doctrine, and therefore many courts have not allowed claims regarding light, but some have—arguing that the doctrine was meant to change with time
      11. **Easement**: debate whether should limit the kind of use to the specific technology at the time time—should telephone wires allow for cable wires? Are courts in the position to determine the intent of the parties?
      12. **Nahrstedt:** court not in position to analyze whether covenant was reasonable in every specific case, if generally reasonable—upheld (Dissent disagreed, if arbitrary to a specific case, shouldn’t apply)
          * In **Euclid** and **Kelo** courts also said would not do piecemeal analysis to determine if totally legitimate in each and every instance (**zoning and E. Domain**)
      13. **Business judgement rule:** applied by boards of common developments and corporations—as long as good process that was either rational or in good faith, won’t look to closely into the decision
      14. **Economic due process:** will defer to the legislature for these issues, like by zoning. Rational basis review
      15. **Substantive due process and equal protection:** when fundamental right at stake or discrimination against suspect class will apply strict scrutiny, otherwise will be back to rational basis review
      16. **Rezoning:** some courts will hold legislatures strictly to the comprehensive plan, while others grant greater discretion—some not requiring consistency at all
          * **Contract zoning:** IDC court said the board was exercising their police power, high presumption of validity
          * **Rezoning as quasi-judicial:** temper deference to legislature in this way
      17. **Mount Laurel Doctrine:** a NJ court actually required cities to ensure that there was housing available for low income tenants, not just for citizens of their own cities, but for the state
          * **Most states** believe this is social engineering and way beyond the power of a court
          * **Mount Laurel II:** imposed affirmative remedies to overlook the process and ensure that it got done
      18. **State action:** when are the courts too involved in upholding private discrimination that it constitutes state action? (1) willing buyers and sellers; (2) cumulative decisions; (3) anytime uphold—unclear where we stand today (**Shelley and Evans)**
      19. **Duty to mitigate:** LL must show took reasonable steps to mitigate damage, even though weight of authority points against the duty, reads in contract law
      20. **Covenants to operate:** will not grant injunctive relief, don’t want to be operating a business, wll grant damages if deemed appropriate
      21. **Javins:** court instituted the implied warranty of habitability against past precedent, saw grave injustice, caused by the past doctrine and could not allow it to stand
          * Less active than Mount Laurel court—didn’t oversee remedies, just created a new right
          * (Notes- see other sections, can defend this decision and Mount Laurel one, on idea of personhood, whiteness as property—to correct past laws that created situation, state v. shack—shaped by human values
      22. **M&T Mortgage Co:** court took on a supervisory role as a court in equity to investigate the matter—“Equity abhors discrimination.”
          * Also, “equity will not enforce discriminatory practices”—harps back to Shelley.
      23. **Eminent domain (kelo):** can’t make sure that each and every parcel is necessary and important for the overall plan, would grind everything to a halt
          * **Regulatory taking:** hard to win a claim, deference to legislature—more likely when it is clear (physical invasion, 100% diminution in value) b/c less discretion involved
          * **Tradition:** look to tradition to determine what government actions short of actual takings have been ruled takings that require just compensation
          * **Prune Yard:** “*Nor as a general proposition is the US, as opposed to the several states, possessed of residual authority that enables it to define “property” in the first instance.”*
            + **Marshall concurrence:** does not believe the court is suggesting that the rights of property are to be defined solely by state law, or that there is no federal constitutional barrier to the abrogation of common-law rights by Congress or a state government. **“Life. Liberty. Property” have a normative dimension, establishing a “sphere of private autonomy which government is bound to respect.”**
          * **Lucas:** limited legislature to entirely removing value of property unless back by common law principles of nuisance—has an effect of freezing the legislature from deciding what constitutes a nuisance and giving it to the courts (and even courts are limited by CL when having to decide if a regulation would be to fix a nuisance)
5. **Property as a bundle of entitlements:**
   1. **INS v. AP:** had property right against competitors, but not against the public at large
   2. **Moore:** Mosk dissent— property is a bundle & some rights can be rid of while still holding onto the core. May be able to give over right of possession but can still retain some of the other rights that came with your cells. Can still protect one’s personhood, while defending these broader interests.
   3. **Right to exclude v. reasonable rights of access:**
      1. **State v. Shack:** right to exclude is not absolute, limited by public policy—property serves human values
      2. **Uston outlier, common carriers**
      3. **State law & constitution in relation to state action**
   4. **ADA and Civil right laws:** generally absolute right to exclude, but that right is curbed to some extent by these statutes
   5. **Nuisance & zoning:** privilege to use limited, cannot use it to harm others
   6. **Public trust doctrine:** quasi-public entity owned the beach and could control how used, but required to allow for public access to some extent
   7. **License as property:** can separate the bundle, even though giving the spouse a piece of the pie, doesn’t mean don’t retain its essence
   8. **Corporations:** property based approach views all shareholders as partial owners of the assets of productions, each have a different stick of the bundle, leading to a different view of corporations than nexus of contract theory
   9. **Power to transfer v. Regulatory doctrines** like estates, common ownership, leaseholds, FHA
   10. **Prune yard:** depriving the shopping center of the right to exclude wasn’t a taking, they still had a lot of the bundle of entitlements
       1. **Loretto:** but when put in a cable box permanently, that wasn’t a carve out of the owner’s rights, but a slice- took off part of the entire bundle, not just one stick
       2. **Takings in general:** generally have immunity from loss, but limited by realities of democratic society for needs of government

1. **Public v. Private distinction**
   1. **Public goods-** belong to all & therefore sometimes need **private rights** in order to make sure that the public has the opportunity to benefit off the good
   2. **Finders:** difference between finding item in private house or on property open to public
   3. **Trespass:** private property has a public responsibility to allow those in necessity to trespass
   4. **P.E:** in past the public couldn’t make a claim, now they can
   5. **Public accommodations law:** places that hold themselves open to business to the public (not private clubs) are required not to discriminate against people on basis of immutable characteristics or disability
      1. **Private actors** can generally exclude for any reason (but see **Uston outlier)**
      2. **Common carriers** need cause to exclude, even if not protected by Public accommodations law
   6. **Public function doctrine:** when an entity acts like a government entity- takes the place of the state, cannot exclude people due to speech
      1. **Public access doctrine:** another iteration, just by opening up and giving access to all- bound like a government entity
   7. **Public trust doctrine:** some things are above the rights of private parties and belong to the public at large
   8. **Public trust doctrine:** can enforce on government and quasi-public entities
   9. **Nuisance:** not just about the interactions of private parties, but about the broader effects on the public
   10. **Contract zoning:** some concern when the zoning is being done based on contract between the government and private parties
   11. **Common interest developments:** a sort of democratic sub-society (woodside)
   12. Subsect: property v. contract distinction
       1. **Corporations:** as they quasi-public entities where everyone is a co-owner in the asset of production v. a more private, contract view of corporations
       2. **Leaseholds:** treating them more as contracts, between the parties, allows for certain doctrines to be applied- mitigation, warranty of habitability, dependent, permission for assignment
   13. **Fair housing:** can discriminate by who you sell it to, but cannot discriminate in public with advertising- must be outside of public eye
       1. **Roommates:** 9th circuit- private living quarters is beyond the reach of fair housing law, can even have ads showing preference. City of Madison- cannot discriminate when looking for roommate- market transaction (involving larger public), not a personal decision about who to live with
   14. **Eminent domain:** Kelo plaintiff claimed that the government was blurring the lines between public and private when taking her property for an economic development plan—court said that there will always be some benefit to private parties, but this was predominantly for the public
   15. **Regulatory takings:** those that effect specific individuals are much more problematic than those that effect the public at large-as part of a broad and general plan
