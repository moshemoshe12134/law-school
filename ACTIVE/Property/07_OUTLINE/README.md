## How to Use These Outlines

### Past Outlines = Reference Only
**DO NOT copy verbatim**. These are for:
- Understanding topic organization
- Seeing what previous students emphasized
- Identifying common rules/cases
- Getting format ideas

### Your Outline = Living Document
Build your own outline incrementally:
1. **After each class**: Add outline inserts from `06_REVIEW/`
2. **Weekly**: Consolidate and organize by topic
3. **Mid-semester**: Create draft attack outline
4. **Before exam**: Finalize both comprehensive and attack outlines

## Outline Strategy

### Comprehensive Outline (Main)
**Purpose**: Deep, detailed reference for studying
**Length**: No limit (but organized clearly)
**Contents**:
- Black letter rules with element breakdowns
- Key cases with facts + holdings
- Statutory text with interpretations
- Policy rationales
- Cross-references
- Hypo examples

**Build using**: `TEMPLATES/outline_insert_template.md`

### Attack Outline (Checklist)
**Purpose**: Quick reference for exam day
**Length**: 5-15 pages max (condense ruthlessly)
**Contents**:
- Issue-spotter checklist
- Element lists (minimal prose)
- Case names only (no facts)
- Key statutory sections (numbers, not full text)
- Common hypo triggers

**Format**: Bullets, tables, flowcharts - whatever works fastest

### Hypo Bank
**Purpose**: Practice application + pattern recognition
**Length**: 50-100 hypos by exam time
**Sources**:
- Class hypos (captured in reviews)
- Textbook problems
- Past exam questions
- E&E examples
- Your own variations

## File Format Recommendations

### For Active Editing:
- **Use Markdown** (`.md` files) - best for AI collaboration
- **Or DOCX** - if you prefer Word

### For Exam Day:
- **PDF** - finalize attack outline as PDF to prevent accidental edits
- **Or printed** - if allowed and preferred
