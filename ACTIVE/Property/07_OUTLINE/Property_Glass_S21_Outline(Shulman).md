**Note to Reader:** Outline is quite long but has lots of info and pretty good overall, I think. More useful for studying than on actual test. Could be used, edited, and added to while in class/during semester.

**Property - Glass**

**Intro**

Property is the body of law that governs relations between people over valued resources.

A property right is an entitlement and good against the world, while contract is only between the people within the contract.

* Bundle of entitlements which ownership confers various rights. But not every property has the whole bundle.

Four major rights of ownership:

1. Right to exclude
2. Right to share
   1. At the same time – ex: marital partner’s
   2. In the future – transfer ownership rights in the future 🡪 leaving property to a descendant
3. Right to use
4. Right to compensation from loss

Source of complexity is four-fold:

1. Every right of ownership is regulated by an intricate set of rules
2. These rules derive from multiple sources
   1. Common law: some of which is multiple centuries old
   2. Statutory law: Local ordinances, state and federal
   3. State and federal constitutional law
3. Many of the rules are ambiguous, in flux, and are actively contested
   1. This is why Restatement is not as important as it is in other areas of law
4. None of the rules are neutral in origins and consequences

Justified by multiple policy goals:

1. Fairness - Equal opportunity, distributive fairness
2. Efficiency - What is a social utility?
3. Legitimacy - Consent theory
4. Administrability - If it’s easy to administer then it should be easy to enforce

We will learn the following, and the final exam will test our knowledge of these:

1. Learn the doctrine and the lawyering skills needed to shape the future of the doctrine.
2. Advise a client how a court is likely to rule.
3. Advocate on behalf of a client by using arguments based on precedent, statutory interpretation, and policy that can persuade a court to adopt the rule you propose
4. Adjudicate a contested question in a way that considers the various consequences of the decision

**Preview for the exam: Focus on**

1. Rule of law
2. Arguments and counter arguments
3. Holding

# Unit 1: Acquisition of Ownership Rights

Chain of Title: The sequence of historical transfer of property from creator in past to present owner. Very important in land transaction.

* Every chain of title has to have a first link which is the Original Acquisition.
  + What steps are needed to accomplish original acquisition, and why these work to accomplish this, is important.
* Three most familiar ways of acquisition:

1. Labor (Locke) 🡪 can get complicated by multiple laborers and when labor ends/starts
2. Possession – the “I got here first” logic
3. Consent/custom 🡪 if there is a general consensus among the people of what constitutes acquisition of items.

* All these theories are incomplete.

## Historical Foundations

RULES FOR ESTABLISHING POSSESSION

1. **Corporal Possession/Mortal Wounding** (*Pierson v. Post*); (*Popov v. Hayashi*)—to take a wild animal out of the commons, you must deprive them of their liberty through mortally wounding them or through actual corporal possession.
   1. Not always **fair**
   2. **Administrable**—if everyone gained possession on first-sight, would lead to more litigation;
   3. **Socially useful** activity—rewards good hunters
2. **Box Theory** (*Keeble v. Hickeringill-* duck case)—if an object/animal is located within boundaries of a property, it is in possession of the property owner
   1. **Fair**—what is on your property is yours;
   2. **Administrable**—clear rule that’s obvious to everyone;
   3. **Socially useful**—incentivizes people to box in what they own and disincentivizes “luring.”
3. **Law of Capture**—the first person to capture a resource owns it, even if the resource is drained or migrates from another’s land. Your ownership interest is in the opportunity to capture, an expectation constituted by custom and social relationships.
   1. **Limits to the Law of Capture:**
      1. **Correlative Rights**—you cannot infringe on another’s reasonable opportunity to capture a common resource (*Popov v. Hayashi*), AND property interest is infringed upon the moment someone begins to exploit the common resource (*Elliff v. Texon Drilling Co*.);
   2. **Fair**—Given limits are followed, everyone has an equal opportunity to capture, which rewards labor;
   3. **Administrable**—it’s clear who has drilled something up and who’s responsible, and it’s too difficult to discern the original origin of individual molecules
   4. **Socially useful**—it’s efficient, because it incentivizes people to quickly claim and invest in their property.

***Pierson v. Post* (NY 1805):** **FAIRNESS, EFFICIENCY, SOCIAL UTILITY**

* Facts: Post was hunting with his dogs and chasing a fox in uninhabited Hamptons. Pierson saw that the fox was being hunted, killed it, and carried it off. Post brought a trespass suit against Pierson claiming he had legal possession of the fox based on a **pre-possessory interest**.
* Rule: Mere pursuit does not confer property right. Property in wild animals (ferae naturae, of a wild nature) is acquired by occupancy, meaning by taking the animal out of the commons with manifest intention by depriving them of their liberty and bringing within certain control through:
  + at least mortally wounding or capturing from a distance so as to deny it any chance of escape
  + at most physical possession through corporeal possession / bodily seizure.
* Holding: Pursuer, Post, has NO legal right to pursued fox. Pierson is the rightful owner. 3 Elements:
  1. Manifest intention
  2. Deprive animal of its liberty
  3. Bring within certain control
* Dissent, Livingston: Hot pursuit is enough.
  1. Closer to **Locke**. Property in wild animals acquired when: the pursuer is within reach OR has a reasonable prospect of taking physical possession.
     + **Locke**: If you invest the labor in something, your property. The act of investing effort into property qualifies it as one’s own and removes it from nature bc you own your own labor (since you own your own body), and so the fruits of your labor are yours. “The hare that any one is hunting, is thought his who pursues her during the chase.”
  2. Policy Argument/Socially useful—It is a public benefit to kill a fox, so we do not want to dissuade hunters from putting in the labor of pursuing, if someone could just come and pick it off;
  3. Fairness—Pierson was a free rider, and he did not share in the “honors or labors of the chase.”
* Importance: The rule of first possession, wild animals can be possessed through occupancy, court moves towards Lockian understanding of property and away from bright line because of intuitive sense of fairness.

**CORRELARIES to *Post*—*Keeble v. Hickeringhill***

1. Keeble possessed ducks on decoy pond within his property; Hickeringhill fired a gun to scare the ducks off to kill them, disturbing Keeble’s exercise and enjoyment of the property;
2. Unlike in *Post*, this was on private property, rather than in the commons. And, private land can acquire things that are in/on it.

**AUTHORITY**

1. Common law—the **law of capture;**
2. Custom—that of “sportsmen” hunters;
   1. Pros to custom:
      1. is a more reliable means because the word is so complex that the court cannot control for all possible scenarios in dif contexts
      2. will ensure that decision sits well with existing norms
      3. can be more efficient, since people can figure out applicable rule on their own
   2. Con to custom: There may be many customs, which can cause confusion.
3. Legal Thought—Barbyrac and Puffendorf.
   1. **Puffendorf**—you can claim occupancy when you have “actual corporal possession” of an animal;
   2. **Barbyrac** qualifies—when your labor “deprive[s] [a wild animal] of their natural liberty” through mortal wounding, you can claim occupancy. You do not necessarily need actual corporal possession.
      1. It seems that mortally wounding and pursuing an animal would be enough, as it would manifest the party’s intent to “appropriate the animal to his individual use,” curtail the animal’s freedom, and bring the animal within her control.
      2. Whether simply pursuing a fox is enough to establish that

***Popov v. Hayashi* (CA 2002): FAIRNESS, PERSONHOOD**

* Facts: Toward the end of 2001 season, baseball player was expected to break his own home run record, and fans began to congregate in the areas where he was most likely to hit a home run. The ball (estimated worth $1 million) was property of MLB, then became abandoned property. Popov attempted to catch ball, glove made contact with ball but he never actually held it, and unclear if he would have had caught it. Popov was tackled to the ground and did not catch. Hayashi was standing nearby and was also tackled. Ended up seeing the ball and put it in his pocket.
* Holding: Both Popov and Hayashi had a qualified right to the ball, and therefore must sell it and split the profits.
  + Holding is narrow but it is still a good case to see how a modern court incorporates these principles
* Rule: When a person takes a “significant but incomplete” step to achieve possession of a piece of property, and the effort is impeded by the **“unlawful acts of others,”** he has a pre-possessory interest in the property. This pre-possessory interest constitutes a qualified right to possession that can support a cause of action.
  + If another does come into complete possession of that object, resulting from the unlawful acts of others, he has an equal and qualified right to possession
* Importance: Rule of equitable division, continuation of acquisition by first possession/capture

Notes:

* Public policy argument: In this case, Popov had exerted some control over the ball, but had not yet acquired possession. It is unknown if he would have acquired possession because he was attacked by the fans seated around him. It would be inappropriate to create an incentive for such attacks to take place. Thus, in this situation, Popov is deemed to have acquired a pre-possessory interest in the ball. BUT, because Hayashi was not involved with the mob that attacked Popov, both Popov and Hayashi have an equal, undivided interest in the ball.
* Fairness argument:
  + Baseball fans are accustomed to dominion and control establishing possession. Popov cannot prove he had dominion and control—he might have still lost the ball, even if he weren’t tackled. He established a pre-possessory interest that was impinged by the illegal actions of the mob. But Hayashi did nothing wrong, was also a victim of the mob. He just happened to find the ball and take possession of it.
  + Awarding the ball to either person would be unfair, so we will split it.
* Court uses language of equity, fundamental fairness, even though this fairness concern is a violation from custom.

**Radin**: This case allows us to see theory of personhood, and also to see how courts wrestle with idea of possession, a deliberately ambiguous idea which is molded to particular circumstances.

### CONQUEST: ACQUISITION BY FORCE

**CASES**: *Johnson v. M’Intosh* (1823)

**JUSTIFICATIONS FOR PROPERY RIGHTS (often competing)**

* + - 1. **Sovereign allocation of rights** (Bentham)—the sovereign gives you your bundle of rights, and without that sovereign to enforce those rights, there will not be property;
         1. That sovereign is essentially delegating to owners its rights over that property.
      2. **Efficiency** or social welfare maximization—preferences individuals who will maximize overall social welfare by engaging in the most productive use of the land;
      3. **Distributive justice or equity**—the desire to prevent gross inequality and ensure distribution to those in need;
      4. **Settled expectations**—customs dictate fair property rights;
      5. **Labor and investment** (Locke)—it’s fair, and encourages produce use of the property;
      6. **Possession or occupancy of the property**—possession can occasionally, after time, ripen into property rights.
         1. **Rule of first possessor**—prevents disputes about title and encourages people to quickly find and claim property.

Sometimes these justifications point in different directions: whoever first finds property may not make the most efficient use of it.

* But, often, they can also support each other: awarding rights to the current possessor might encourage investment in the property.

POSITIVISM (i.e. Chief Justice Marshall in *Johnson v. M’Intosh*)

1. **Positivists** identify law with the “commands of the sovereign”—they believe that judges should exercise extreme discretion when there are gaps, conflicts, or ambiguities in the law.
   1. Separate law and morality. Emphasize that, although moral judgments may underlie rules of law, they are NOT fully or consistently enforced by legal sanctions, and thus we should NOT interpret law that way either
   2. **Justice Holmes’s “bad man” test**—we should look at the law as bad men would. They would not be interested in the moral content, but rather what sanctions would be put upon them if they broke the law;
   3. **Llewellyn**—law is what officials will do to resolve disputes;
   4. **Bentham**: The “idea of property consists in an established expectation…of being able to draw…and advantage from the thing possessed.”
      1. It is the sovereign that allows you to do so. Without the sovereignty there would be no property rights.
   5. **Cheryl Harris:** discusses the role of being white and property.

**Critiques by Rights theorists**—we should interpret gaps or ambiguities in the law in a manner that protects rights, promotes fairness, and ensures justice, rather than just what we think the actual letter of the law means.

***Johnson v. M’Intosh* (1823):**

* Facts: Two chains of competing title:
  1. Johnson’s claim: Piankeshaw → Viviat, Murray (1775) → Johnson, Graham
  2. M’Intosh’s claim: King → Virginia Company (1609) → Virginia Colony (aka the King) (1624) → State of Virginia (1776) → US (1803 and 1809) → M’Intosh (1818)
* Johnson sued M’Intosh for ejectment from his lands, alleging:
  1. The Piankeshaws were owners of the land when they sold it to Viviat, and that the Indians’ title and power to sell should be respected;
  2. 1763 proclamation by the King to not buy land did not apply to the Indian tribes because they were not British subjects;
  3. 1763 proclamation by the King also void concerning the purchasers, because it violated the spirit of government as a system of laws;
  4. 1779 Act of Virginia cannot keep them from claiming these lands, because the “legislature was not competent to take away” private property
* Holding:
  1. The titles granted to Viviat and Murray by the Illinois and Piankeshaw CANNOT be recognized in the courts. An absolute title held by Indians is incompatible with the Crown’s and US’ absolute title, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy - a right which Crown/US has absolute title to extinguish.
     1. Title thus cannot be recognized by US courts.
  2. **Scope of power of Indians to give** - The law which regulates relations between conqueror and conquered was incapable of application to a people under such circumstances (fierce savages, threat of massacre by Europeans, frequent and bloody wars).
     1. Indians’ were incapable of transferring the absolute title to others, but they ceded this property to the US after American Revolutionary War, so title to Johnson amounted to nothing.
  3. **Scope of power of individuals to receive -** If an individual subject of Crown/US extinguished Indian title and used for own benefit, could still only acquire through title of gov. Grant of title derives efficacy from gov’s will.
     1. The treaty ending the American Revolutionary War transferred sovereignty and power of the lands under such transfers from the British to the United States
* Rule:
  1. Land title transfers are ONLY valid when made under the rule of the currently prevailing government.
  2. **Under doctrine of discovery**, the first European to see the land possesses the exclusive right of acquiring title to it over any other European (through purchase or conquest), subject only to the Indian right to occupancy.
  3. **Under doctrine of conquest**, right of occupancy gives a party exclusive title (right to conquest & purchase), but does not give that discoverer full property rights until conquest & purchase. Marshall: Right of occupancy includes right to sell.
* Importance: Discovery of land brings with it the right to obtain title either by purchase or conquest.

**SOURCES OF AUTHORITY**

1. Common law—the **law of conquest and discovery**
   1. When John Cabot received a commission by the monarch in 1496 to discover lands—by sailing along the coast, it counted as discovery;
      1. They also had to settle it—which happened with Jamestown in ~1600;
2. **Custom**—European nations who were settling the Americas at the time followed this custom, which eventually ripened into the **“law of nations;”**

**JUSTIFICATION**

1. **Socially useful** to give the land to the U.S. Also, **Locke**—the Indians have NOT put in the **labor** or investment that counts as possessory acts;
   1. It is **efficient**—to give the Indians the land would be to keep it a “wilderness” and undeveloped—this is the best way to maximize welfare
2. **Custom of first possessor** among European nations—Discovery by subjects gives title to their government
   1. **Socially useful:** Rule was supposed to minimized conflict between European Nations
   2. **Fair**: what the Europeans did may have been wrong, but they couldn’t just incorporate the Indians into their society because they were “fierce savages” who couldn’t be governed as a “distinct people;”
      1. Normally it would be fair to incorporate them, but that is not possible here—so there is an “excuse.”
   3. There is an **expectation** around this custom that should be respected: **Theft ripening over time into property rights through the growth of expectations.**
3. **Consequences and the role of the courts**—Marshall cannot acknowledge that the Indians had title without angering the American public and unraveling the entire system of title/property
   1. In particular, this would create questions about the legitimacy of the Louisiana Purchase and the purchase of Florida
      1. So, by justifying this injustice, he is perhaps preventing another
   2. Not the **role** of the courts to determine this—“the **discovery doctrine** is the law because the government in charge said so, and the government has the power to say who can acquire property rights and how;”
      1. **Positivism**—it is not Marshall’s role to address rightness or wrongness of a rule even if it is contrary to the “law of the creator.”—“Conquest gives a title to which the courts of conqueror cannot deny…not for the Courts of this country to question the validity of this title;”

**THEME**: **Property rights created by and in favor of those in power**—the discovery doctrine is the law because the government in charge said so.

### ENSLAVEMENT

Readings: Whiteness as property, Prigg v. Penn (1842), and Harper, Speech at NY Anti-Slavery Society

## Contemporary Debates and Relativity of Title

### FOUND PROPERTY

**CASES**: *Armory v. Delamarie (1722), Charrier v. Bell (1986), Wilcox v. Stroup (2006)*

Property rights are sometimes relative—they are good against some in certain circumstances, but not against others.

1. When the strength of your title can vary based upon the parties claiming the property.
2. Ex. Your right to exclude doesn’t hold in the face of an emergency—it’s not trespass to crash your plane onto another’s land.

Finding lost property or possessing land, even without official title to the property, will create rights against subsequent possessors, but NOT against the title owner.

* Common illustration of relativity of title: Who truly owns the property depends on who the conflict is with (original owner/possessor of the property, subsequent possessor, or owner of the land on which the property is found) and whether the property is considered lost, mislaid, abandoned.

LAW OF FINDERS:

1. Finder vs. Subsequent Possessor (*Armory*)
2. Finder vs. “Rightful” Owners (*Wilcox* & *Charrier*)
3. Finder vs. Owner of the Premises Where Property Was Found: Discussed Below
   1. Place Open to the Public, or on Private with Owner’s Permission? – Courts are divided:
      1. Lost? – Finder Often Prevails
      2. Mislaid? – Owner of Premises Often Prevails

**TWO GENERAL RULES**

1. **Law of Finders**—Finding lost property or possessing land, even without official title to the property, will create rights against subsequent possessors, but NOT against the title owner
   1. **JUSTIFICATION for Law of Finders:**
      1. **Efficient**—reduces incentive to steal
      2. **Fair**—lets people who were there “first” establish a claim against those whom would kick them off merely because they can
      3. **Administrable**—the rule allows decisions to be made even if the true owner is not identifiable.
   2. For **real property** *(Christy v. Scott*)—mostly, in order to claim better title relative to someone else, you MUST show a history of possession: Examples:
      1. Use and building on the land/improving it through labor (Locke)
      2. Excluding others from it.
   3. **THEME**: theft can, over time, ripen into property rights.
2. Who truly owns the property depends on (1) WHO the conflict of title is with and whether the property is determined to be lost, mislaid, or abandoned:
   1. **Lost**—true owner accidentally misplaced it
   2. **Mislaid**—true owner intentionally left it and then forgot where they put it
   3. **Abandoned**—true owner formed intent to relinquish all rights to the property.
      1. The older the artifact, the more the true owner *intended* to abandon it, because she did not make an attempt to recover it (*Armory*)
      2. There are also considerations of **custom** (*Charrier)*—you put things in the garbage that you intend to abandon, you put things by a gravesite that you intend to remain there, so you have not abandoned them.
3. **Finders** v. **true owner:** if **lost or mislaid** then goes to true owner, but finders will generally win against the true owner if the property is abandoned.
4. Finder v. Property Owner (but NOT original object owner:
   * 1. Lost, mislaid, or abandoned object—the **landowner will win if the finder was trespassing** at the time they found the object.
     2. If the finder was NOT trespassing then courts are divided:
        1. If it’s in a **private home**, the homeowner will usually win;
        2. If it was lost, and the landowner was not the original owner, the finder will win;
     3. If it’s in a **public space** or if on **property with the owner’s permission**:
        1. **Lost** property typically awarded to the **finder**;
        2. **Mislaid** property typically awarded to the **owner of property**;
           1. *Benjamin v. Lindner Aviation*—Person found $18,000 rolled up on a plane and turned it in; the court awarded it to the bank that owned the plane, finding that it was **mislaid**.
     4. If it’s **embedded in the soil**, the property is usually awarded to the landowner rather than the finder—even if lost, mislaid, or abandoned.
        1. Exception is the **doctrine of the treasure trove**—gold/silver buried in “antiquity”/more than a century usually goes to the finder, as long as they weren’t trespassing at the time.
   1. Criticism: depends too much on determinations of the unknown owner’s **intent** and perverse **incentives** for finders.

***Wilcox v. Stroup* (4th Cir. 2006): Finder vs. “Rightful” Owners**

* Facts: Wilcox found Civil War documents that were in his family for generations. The docs concerned Confederate communication and were appraised at $2.4M. Wilcox allowed South Carolina Dept of Archives and History to microfilm the docs, then he tried to sell to third party. Dept brought temporary restraining order preventing Wilcox from selling. Wilcox brought this suit for a declaratory judgment that he owned the docs.
* Holding: Where neither party can establish ownership of an object, the person in possession is presumed to be the owner. In other words, possession is prima facie evidence of ownership. “Absent proof to the contrary, settled expectations will continue undistributed.”
  1. This presumption: avoids confusion, maintains the status quo, and encourages those in possession to make improvements to that which they possess. Such a presumption is used when both parties unable to establish title and when: doing so promotes stability, protects public peace against violence/disorder, and does not frustrate public interest. Prevents court from “presiding over a historical goose chase.”
  2. Supported by administrability and social utility
* Rule: When there isn’t enough evidence to establish title to an object (aka object is of unknown provenance), presumption that whoever is in possession of the object is rightful owner, not the finder.
* Importance: Rule of Finders vs. “Rightful” Owners – Owners. Presumption in favor of possession.

Notes:

* SC’s argument: these documents are public records that are part of state archives. Evidence: Based on when family moved out, there is argument to be made that had it not been for the Union’s invasion, docs would have remained in state archives. Also, evidence of a system of archiving the docs that was in the works.
* The court determined that without the benefit of clear chain of title, evidence of original ownership, eyewitness testimony, or other useful aids in determining ownership, the court presumes ownership in favor of possession.
* In this case, neither Wilcox nor Stroup are able to present sufficient records to establish ownership of the Civil War docs by a preponderance of the evidence. As a result, the court rests on the presumption that because the documents have been in possession of Willcox’s family for 140 years, he is the rightful owner. Further, because Stroup does not have any evidence sufficient to rebut this presumption, this court concludes that Willcox is the owner of the docs.

***Charrier v. Bell* (La. 1986): Finder vs. Landowner**

* Facts: An amateur archaeologist obtained consent of the caretaker of some land to survey it for possibility of burial locations of the Tunica-Biloxi Indians. The archaeologist excavated over 150 burial sites, realized that the caretaker was not the true owner, but continued to work in the site.
  1. Archaeologist tried to sell the artifacts to Harvard, but he could not because he couldn’t prove ownership.
  2. Archaeologist sued the landowners for declaratory relief confirming that he was the true owner and requested compensation under the theory of unjust enrichment for his time and expenses
  3. Argument: Archeologist claimed ownership b/c insufficient evidence to show tribe is legal descendant of burial, tribe abandoned artifacts. Even if not owner wanted compensation for unjust enrichment.
* Holding: Tribe is true owners of artifacts and archaeologist NOT entitled to them.
  1. When individuals bury objects with the deceased, their intentions are that those objects remain there forever, not that they become free for the taking. (Based on context → NOT abandonment). In such cases, intent to relinquish possession is not equivalent to intent to relinquish ownership.
  2. Justifications:
     1. **Custom** of the area: when you put artifacts on gravesites, you are intending them to remain there perpetually;
     2. **Efficient**: disincentivizes grave-robbing;
     3. **Radin**: Buried property is bound up in personhood, it is NOT alienable
* Rule: In the absence of a perfect chain of title, a federally recognized tribe can establish ownership over excavated burial groups when (1) The tribe claiming ownership is an accumulation of the descendants of the original owners, and (2) The original owners’ intention in interring the objects was not to abandon the good, but rather, for the burial goods to remain there perpetually.
* Importance: Rule of Trespassing Finder vs. Landowner – Landowner wins.

Note:

* Consideration of custom – you put things in the garbage that you intend to abandon, you put things by a gravesite that you intend to remain there, so you have not abandoned them
* Court also rejected Charrier’s claim of unjust enrichment. Could not show a resulting impoverishment because the majority of the excavation occurred while he had knowledge that he did not have consent to be on the land, aka was trespassing.
  1. If Charrier was trespasser, then artifacts belong to property owner.
  2. A thief has a superior claim under relativity of title to subsequent thieves, but a thief cannot pass on true title, and only has possessory interest

Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 (NAGPRA): corrects gaps in law and morality that left Native American graves unprotected

***Armory v. Delamirie* (KB 1722): Finder vs. Subsequent Possessor**

* Facts: Chimney sweep found a jewel, brings to goldsmith for appraisal but apprentice appropriated jewel through deceit and refused to return. Cause of action is trover (wrongful interference with personal property). Seeking return of jewel, or payment of its value.
* Holding: Chimney sweep, though he does not have absolute property or ownership, has superior claim against all but the rightful owner. Even if chimney sweep loses the jewel, he still possesses it because he was the original finder. If lost it goes to finder, if mislaid goes to the owner of the property.
* Rule: Finding a lost, mislaid, or abandoned object/chattel does not confer an absolute property right nor ownership, but it does give the finder a stronger claim against all subsequent claims except by that of the true owner. Subsequently may maintain trover
  1. **JUSTIFICATION**
     1. **Fair/labor (**Locke**)**—the boy put in labor to obtain the object, not the goldsmith, and so the boy should be able to enjoy the fruits of that labor;
     2. **Efficient**—it disincentivizes bad behavior, like a “chain of theft;”
        1. And it incentivizes good behavior by awarding finders for looking for lost items and taking greater care of the items they own;
* Importance: Rule of Finders vs. Subsequent Possessors – Finder. Has possessory interest against all except true owner.

Notes: The older the artifact, the more the true owner intended to abandon it, bc did not attempt to recover it

Hypotheticals:

* Conflicts between finder and owner of the premises, courts will consider the particular facts of the case…:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Facts** | **Outcomes** |
| Trespassing finder? | Owner of the premises |
| Private home? | Ordinarily to the homeowner |
| Property open to the public? | Courts are divided |
| Property that has been lost? | Ordinarily to the finder |
| Property that has been mislaid? | Ordinarily to the owner of the premises |
| Property that has been embedded in the soil? | Ordinarily to the owner of the premises, except in jurisdictions that apply treasure trove exception |

### INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: ACQUISITION BY INNOVATION:

Copyright Law and Patent Law

This area of relativity of title especially relates to **Locke** (labor/investmentasis the basis for property rights). This is especially pressing in instances of creative labor. The property is not physical, and can be shared with many people with very little additional effort.

**Three forms of IP LAW:**

1. Copyrights (exclusive rights in literary and artistic works)
2. Patents (exclusive rights in inventions)
3. Trademarks (exclusive rights in symbols that indicate the source of goods or services; originated in state common law and supplemented by federal legislation).

**IP STATUTES**

1. **Copyright** (17 U.S.C. : “Original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression;”
   1. Exclusive right to use or authorize the use of work for a limited time, then it becomes public domain;
   2. Usual time period is the author’s life plus 70 years, 95 years after publication, or 120 years after creation of works made for hire.
2. **Patent**: Issued to anyone who “invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter or any new and useful improvement thereof.”
   1. Generally lasts 20 years;
   2. Must be registered—U.S. Patent Office adjudicates whether new and non-obvious.
3. **Trademark**: for non-functional words, symbols, names, and devices used to identify goods and services;
   1. Does not bar uses of the mark that would not deceive customers or dilute the value of the mark (parodies and comparisons are fair game).

**THEORIES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**

* Utilitarian Theory:
  1. Addresses underproduction of creative ideas, which are public good (resources consumed non-rivalrously & which are non-excludable).
  2. In IP context, focuses on problem of uncompensated positive externalities produced by creative/inventive ideas. To overcome free-rider problem, must take affirmative steps to encourage public good production. But where copying is not easy or innovators can recapture the value of their investment through the market advantages of being the first mover, utilitarian argument doesn’t offer much support for IP rights. A cost of IP is that preventing freeriders from competing with innovators drives up price of consumption, and monopoly pricing usually results. IP rights have to be calibrated to balance various costs and benefits.
* Locke
  1. Innovative ideas and creative production are products of the inventor’s intellectual labor. People should be entitled to products of their own labor.
  2. Scholars argue this w special force to IP since products of intellectual labor are genuinely new, so don’t detract from common resources nor leave anyone worse off. But, almost all individual creation draws on others’ work.
* Radin
  1. Creative works are extensions of oneself. Law should extend protections accordingly.
  2. Through the creative process, the inventor/creator’s very identity becomes bound up with the invention/creation. This bond between creator/creation gives rise to an entitlement to control the dissemination/use of the created work.
  3. But, same Lockean ambiguities about intellectual borrowing apply.
  4. Plus, identity of others besides creator can become tied up with intellectual creation.

### Copyright:

**Copyright Act of 1976 (Originality Requirement), 17 U.S.C. §102, 106, 107**

Regulates copyright law. Federal statute that preempts state law. Copyright protection is created automatically, with no need by author or creator to take any affirmative steps, although authors need to register their copyrights before suing for infringement.

* § 102 Protects “original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression” (including literary, musical, dramatic, graphic, pictorial, choreographic, architectural, or sculptural works) that “can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.” Grants owners exclusive rights to copy, distribute, perform, or display those works publicly and to make derivative works from them.
* Ideas and facts can’t be copyrighted; only original EXPRESSIONS of ideas can.
* Authors own what they create unless they performed “work for hire” (owned by employer).
* Copyright protection lasts for life of owner plus 70 years, after which work becomes part of public domain. Re: works for hire, copyright lasts 95 years from date of first publication or 120 years from date of creation, whichever comes first.
* § 107 Under the fair use exception, allow use of copyrighted works without owner’s consent. Use is privileged for purposes like: criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research. None of these purposes automatically signifies fair use. Requires determination of purpose/character of use, part used, effect on market or work’s value.

No bright line rule that separates the protectable expression from the non-protectable idea.

**102a, Step 1** - **Is there copyright protection?**

1. Original (see *Feist v. Rural Telegraph*)
2. Work of authorship
3. Fixed in tangible medium

Section 102b

* Not an idea, concept, principle / process, system, method?

**106, Step 2** - **Is there copyright infringement?** (*Suntrust*)

**107, Step 3** - **Is there a fair use defense?** (*Suntrust*)

1. Purpose and character of the work
2. Nature of the copyrighted work
3. Amount and sustainability of the portion used
4. Effect on the market value of original

***The Originality Requirement – Feist v. Rural Telephone (1991)***

* Facts: Telephone Service published phonebook alphabetically listing the names of its subscribers in its white pages. Rural obtained the information for its white pages directly from its subscribers. Feist Publications distributed a similar phonebook covering a larger geographical area. To obtain its white pages listings, Feist contacted Rural and other phone companies offering to pay to use their white pages listings, but Rural denied permission b/c the companies compete for advertising revenue. But Feist used Rural listings anyway, so Rural sued Feist for copyright infringement.
  1. Feist insisted that facts CANNOT be copyrighted. Organization of facts can be though but MUST be an original style of organization.
     1. Emphasizes the progress of science and only establishes copyright if it is truly original.
  2. Rural’s proposed rule is that putting in work give copyright – sweat of the brow.
* Holding: An alphabetical phonebook, although a specific selection and arrangement of facts, is NOT creative enough to be considered an original work and thus does not warrant copyright protection.
  1. Facts are not copyrightable, and although compilations of facts may be if consist of some degree of creativity, they are not copyrightable per se.
  2. Rural selected which facts to include, they are arranged alphabetically, which is NOT a creative arrangement. Rural’s phonebook is not copyrightable and Feist cannot be held liable for copyright infringement.
* Importance: To be granted copyright protection, works must be original, meaning that they entail some minimal degree of creativity. Facts alone are not copyrightable, but a creative/original compilation of facts may be copyrightable.

Notes:

* “In summary, the 1976 revisions to the Copyright Act leave no doubt that originality, not “sweat of the brow,” is the touchstone of copyright protection in directories and other fact-based works…The selection, coordination, and arrangement of Rural’s white pages do not satisfy the minimum constitutional standards for copyright protection.”
* Different jurisdictions held by dif doctrines. This court rejects that these facts are creative, and test for whether compilation comes within original work of authorship category is that it is created independently with some modicum of creativity.
* **Glass:** Court may be using originality as proxy for amount of labor you put in, the quality you’re creating, and its overall usefulness.

***SunTrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin (11th Cir., 2001):* The Fair Use Defense**

* Facts: Houghton Mifflin published The Wind Done Gone (TWDG) based on the famous book, Gone with the Wind (GWTW). TWDG served as a critique of the depiction of slavery in the south in GWTW by using its characters, plot, and major scenes. SunTrust is copyright holder of GWTW and brought copyright infringement suit against Houghton Mifflin.
* Holding: Not enjoined from publication based on copyright infringement bc Fair Use Doctrine. In determining whether a work is entitled to the Fair Use defense, court looks at following factors. Court looks at all factors, but weighs some more heavily than others.
  1. Purpose and character of the work
  2. Nature of the copyrighted work
  3. Amount and sustainability of the portion used
  4. Effect on the market value of original
* **Copyright Act** “promotes public access to knowledge b/c it provides an economic incentive for authors to publish books and disseminate ideas to the public.” And “without the limited monopoly authors would have little economic incentive to create and publish their work. Therefore, by providing this incentive the copyright law promotes the public access to new ideas.”
  + Very utilitarian type argument

Use of a copyright is permitted to fulfill one of the important purposes listed in Copyright Clause:

1. Promotion of learning

* Provides public access to knowledge bc it provides an economic incentive for authors to publish books, thus increasing public access to new ideas and concepts

1. Protection of the public domain

* Grant of a copyright encourages public to create new works, and the limitation ensures that that the works will eventually enter the public domain, which protects public’s right of access and use

1. Exclusive rights of the author

* To encourage creation of original works

HOW YOU FRAME ISSUE IS VERY IMPORTANT

* Court concludes that the book “exploits….” . Then analyzes the Fair Use defense.

PROCESS FOR ANALYZING:

1. Threshold question: Would a reasonable person see the work as being a parody?
   1. Rule: Parody = having an aim “to criticize a prior work by appropriating elements of the original in creating a new artistic, as opposed to scholarly or journalistic, work.
2. Does the work fall within the Fair Use Doctrine in light of the four factors listed in the statute?

* **Purpose and character of the work** **(commercial nature OR for nonprofit education purposes)**
  + TWDG is a commercial product, which weighs against fair use, but because TWDG adds a new meaning to GWTW by transforming its copyrighted elements into a critique, this factor as a whole weighs **in favor**.
* **Nature of the copyrighted work**
  + B/c GWTW is an original work of fiction, it is entitled to a high degree of protection and so this factor weights **against**.
* **Amount and sustainability of the portion used**
  + TWDG does take a substantial portion of GWTW; however, a certain portion is necessary in order to “conjure up” an image of GWTW, which is necessary for the criticism. Copyright protection affords greater protection to original works of fiction, but this prong is irrelevant here bc TWDG is parody, drawing on publicly known work. As a result, this factor remains **neutral**.
* **Effect on the market value of original**
  + Unlikely that TWDG would supplant GWTW in the marketplace because they are such different works in different genres, so this factor weighs **in favor.**

Accordingly, based on an analysis of the factors as a whole, TWDG is entitled to a fair use defense / copyright use bc only 1/4 factors weighs against defense, but 2/4 weigh in favor.

### PATENT LAW

**CASES**: *A.M.P. v. Myriad* (2013); *Moore v. Regents* (Cal. 1990)

Protects inventions and curbs the tragedy of the commons/the free-rider problem. Balancing the value of open and free use and the promotion of innovation/creativity.

**Patents** – Grant inventors of machines, processes, and compositions of matter a monopoly/protection over inventions for up to 20 years. Granted by the PTO (unlike copyrights, which exist from the moment a work is first fixed into a tangible form).

Substantive limits on patents – only granted if all requirement of 5 factor test are met:

1. Subject matter is patentable (machine, process/method of manufacture, composition of matter)
2. Novel
3. Nonobvious
4. Useful
5. Fully and particularly described

**US Constitution Art. I, cl. 8. Copyright Clause**

Provides power to create/provide copyrights/patents.Authorizes Congress to “promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.”

**Section 101 of Patent Act (35 U.S.C. § 101)**

“Whoever **invents** or **discovers** any new and useful… composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.”

The Patent Act Section 101: Lists 5 different criteria for an invention to be patentable (above):

* Need to then get patent AND must clear hurdle of judicially created exemptions.
  + A key distinction between copyright and patent is that NO patent exists until you go and get patent, but with copyright you get it automatically.
  + Judicial Exceptions: (1) laws of nature, (2) natural phenomenon, and (3) abstract ideas

***Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.* (US, 2013)**

* Facts: Patented a test for BRCA gene which used the genomic sequence. They labored to create the tests based on the genomic sequence and they have DISCOVERED something (similar to explorers discovering America).
  + They are also applying for patent of cDNA which is synthetically made (where introns were removed).
* What Myriad might argue: We could look to the principle of Labor, first possession, sovereignty, and personhood
  + Principle of first possession (from *Johnson v. Macintosh* and others) – that the first person to gain control of something owns it.
  + From the statute we would try for the Composition of Matter argument (not a process).
  + Sweat of the brow doctrine might also apply here
  + *Diamond v. Chakrabarty* is the typical case for arguing for narrow reading of judicial exceptions.
    - Could claim that it is not the role of the courts to make another patent rule outside of congress so exemption should be read narrowly.
* AMP argument: Law is on their side b/c naturally occurring phenomenon cannot be patented.
  + Use the *Funk Brother Seed Co. v. Kato Inoculant Co.* which said that combining bacteria, but no change was NOT patentable.
* Holding: BRCA1 and BRCA2 are naturally occurring molecules and are not patentable. cDNA is patentable because it is not naturally occurring, but is instead produced by a lab technician based on DNA.
* Ruling: Since a patent must include creation, a naturally occurring DNA segment is not patentable merely because it has been isolated. On the other hand, the cDNA of Myriad, which does not occur in nature, can be patented.

Notes:

* Court relies mainly on efficiency arguments
* Well-established standard: “incentives that lead to creation, invention, and discovery” v. “impeding the flow of information that might permit/spur invention”. Must apply this standard here to determine whether Myriad’s patents claim any “new and useful... composition of matter” (patentable), or instead claim naturally occurring phenomena (not patentable).
* Black women have significantly higher breast cancer mortality rates than white women, per state.
* What is not implicated by this decision:
  1. Method - Had Myriad created an innovative method of manipulating genes while searching for the BRCA1/2, could have sought a method patent. But, Myriad’s processes for DNA isolation were well understood, widely used, and fairly uniform amongst all scientists searching for genes.
  2. New applications - As first party with knowledge of BRCA1/2 sequences, Myriad was in excellent position to claim applications of that knowledge. Many of its unchallenged claims are limited to such applications, which are patentable.
  3. Scientific alteration of genetic code - if not simply isolated but rather altered sequence of nucleotides, patentable.
* Court treats DNA like news - as something existing in the world ?

**Takeaways:** Statutory categories and judicial exceptions to patent law, and concerns about judicial competency.

**Preliminary cases (quoted in *Myriad*):**

* *Diamond v. Chakrabarty* (1980): a naturally occurring bacteria used with plasmids to breakdown crude oil was patentable. So modified bacteria was patentable.
  + This logic was NOT used with Dolly the sheep.
* *Funk Brother Seed Co. v. Kato Inoculant Co. (1948):* Combination of nitrogen fixing bacteria was NOT patentable b/c it fell into the law of nature exception.

***Moore v. Regents* (Cal. 1990):** **DETERMINING RIGHTS OF DONORS**

* Facts: Moore undergoes treatment for hairy-cell leukemia at UCLA Medical Center. Has spleen removed, blood drawn. Doctors manufacture cell line based on blood cells (lymphokines) for profitable research without obtaining Moore’s consent, and obtain a patent for the cell line.
* Importance: Bodily autonomy does not come with the “bundle of rights” of normal property interest – you do not retain property interest in your body after a piece of it is removed.

Rule:

* + 1. A patient’s consent to a medical procedure will not be effective if physician failed to disclose her personal research and economic interests beforehand.
       1. Moore has cause of action against Golde for invading a legally protected patient interest
    2. Once cells leave / are removed from a patient’s body after surgery, he no longer has sufficient ownership rights over the cells to uphold a conversion claim.
       1. Since Moore did not expect to retain possession of his cells following their removal, to sue for their conversion he must have retained an ownership interest in them (property interest in cells or patent).

Reasoning:

1. Moore was commoditizing something that shouldn’t be commoditized (**Radin**). Worried about the possibility of a world where you could put your body parts on a market.
   * Moore’s argument—the industry is commoditizing my body, and you’re rewarding them for taking my body and profiting, you’re just not allowing me to have the profits;
   * So there’s the second move possible—if you’re concerned about commoditization, can make it a rule not to sell, you can only give it away.
2. **Fairness**: Lymphokines, unlike name or face, have same molecular structure in every human being. Not unique.
3. **Consistency with Existing Law**: Statues already regulate tissue disposal limit control over excised cells for reasons of public health and safety. Such statutes already eliminate rights ordinarily attached to property.
4. **Fairness/Labor**: Patented cell line is factually and legally distinct from cells in Moore’s body. Federal law permits patenting organisms that are products of “human ingenuity,” not discovery of naturally occurring organisms (the original cells in Moore’s body)
5. **Social Utility:** Risk of disincentivizing research by exposing researchers engaged in socially useful activity to liability – thousands of lines already exist in tissue repositories; routinely copied and distributed.
6. **Role of Courts/Institutional Competence:** “If scientific uses of human cells are to be held liable for failing to investigate the consensual pedigree of their raw materials, we believe the legislature should make that decision.”

Concurrence, Arabian: Moore trying to comingle the sacred (body/cell) and the profane (property, aka human creation).

* **Radin**: it degrades the human being to treat tissue as fungible

Dissent, Mosk:

* If we see property concept as a bundle of entitlements that may be exercised with respect to an object, then we can say that Moore can get rid of some rights while holding on to the core. 1) right to possess, 2) right to use, 3) right to exclude, 4) right to transfer. Majority says because discarded tissue is regulated, there is no property interest.
* It is possible to recognize some property interests and not others in object (contracts can limit transfer of real property, etc.)
* The bargaining power is too weak for a patient for him to give up a property right. This exploitation of Moore’s body for the benefit of another is akin to slavery and should not be tolerated.
* Fairness: Cell line is primarily the work product of Regents, but Moore’s contribution is critical. Without his cell, the product wouldn’t exist. Although Regents is the rightful patent holder, Moore had a critical contribution to the invention, as without his cells there would have been no invention. Regents was unjustly enriched, and Moore should be compensated accordingly.

Arguments:

* Moore: Cell lines are unique.
  + Cell lines are unique like a human likeness, which is protected under privacy rights (i.e. celebrities have proprietary interest in own likeness, and unauthorized commercial use of likeness is redressible as a tort.)
  + His cell line is his property.
* Regents: Cell lines are not unique.
  + Marketed cell line is new creation
  + Value created through their labor (**Locke**)
  + Labor also created an expectation to gain advantage from ownership (Bentham)

Notes:

* #fixbill101 – Proposed bill from June 2019 that permits patenting natural phenomena.
* **Senator Tillis & Coons, June 2019** (proposed the bill)– **“**The US patent system with regard to patent eligibility is broken and desperately needs to be repaired. The US Supreme Court has confused and narrowed Section 101 of the Patent Act to the point that investors are reluctant to pursue the innovations that propel our country forward.”

# Unit 2: The Right to Exclude

## Property Not Open to the Public

THE THREE ACCESS DOCTRINES

1. **Adverse Possession (kind of)**—By using someone’s land, the true owner cannot exclude after time passes and the title is transferred
2. **Trespass/Public Accommodation**—the right to exclude is limited by certain fairness considerations (civil rights statutes, common carriers)
   1. There are the considerations of need—*State v. Shack*
   2. And the considerations of Constitutional rights—*Marsh v. Alabama.*
3. **Public Trust**—certain kinds of property are inherently public, meaning that you cannot exclude without undermining commerce
   1. Should be inalienable (connection to **Radin** -some property should not be sold)

### Trespass

**CASES**: *State v. Shack* (public policy), *Commonwealth v. Magadini* (necessity), and *Jaques v. Steenberg* (deciding remedies).

A trespass is an **unprivileged intentional intrusion on property possessed by another**.

1. The intrusion occurs the moment you enter the property
   1. Can be physical entry or from an object
2. “Intentional” means that the trespass was voluntary.
   1. You can still trespass if you did not intend to violate the possessor’s property rights.
3. A **“privileged”** intrusion that is NOT wrongful can include:
   1. Entry that is done with the **consent** of the owner.
   2. Entry that is justified to prevent a more serious harm/injury (**necessity**).
   3. Entry that is otherwise encouraged by **public policy**—to stop a crime, to rescue, etc.
4. The possessor does not have to be the owner;
5. Trespass can include *ad coelom et ad inferos* (“up to the heavens and down to the depths”)—exceptions are now included for acts like fracking, flying planes, etc.

**THEME**: *sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas* (“one should use his property as not to injure the rights of others”);

###

**THE RIGHT TO EXCLUDE**

Property owners have an **absolute right to exclude** others from their commercial property for any reason not specifically prohibited by statute, **unless they are a common carrier**

* Justifications for why the **right to exclude is central property** right:
  1. **Socially useful**: it protects owners and empowers them to put property to its most productive use;
  2. **Efficient**: economizes information costs by sending a clear message to people other than the owner
  3. “one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.” Dolan v. City of Tigard (1994). A right is unreal if it is unenforceable.

1. Justifications for the **common carrier exception**:
   1. **Socially useful**: because common carriers are monopolies, denial of service is like a denial to the right to travel or the right to seek shelter;
   2. **Necessity**: common carriers provide necessities whose denial would place individuals at risk;
   3. **Fair** (reliance/expectations): the public relies on the expectation that common carriers are available to serve public needs

Other property rights include the right to (1) possess; (2) alienate; (3) enjoy the fruits of profits of the property; and (5) the right to destroy.

***State v. Shack (public policy as privileged entry) (N.J. 1971)***

**FACTS**

1. Defendants entered Plaintiff’s property to try to aid migrant farmworkers employed and housed there;
   1. Defendants (members of an organization funded by the Office of Economic Opportunity) were there to administer medical care and give out literature about the farmworker’s legal rights.
2. Plaintiff insisted that he be present for the meeting, and the defendants declined, asserting their right to meet the workers in private;
3. Plaintiff demanded that they leave, the defendants refused, and the plaintiff ejected them and sued for trespass according to a local statute;
   1. Defendants allege that, under NJ state law, they cannot be barred from administering government services, which they were there to do.
4. **ISSUE**—Can P exclude Defendants who were providing government-protected services?

**HOLDING**—No, the conduct was **“privileged”** and thus beyond the reach of the trespass statute

1. The conduct was encouraged by **public policy**—the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 targets assistance for seasonal migrant workers. It frustrates the purpose of policy to exclude the Defendants.
2. The conduct **necessary** to prevent harm to the farmworkers—one of them needed medical care.
3. This is not a normal landlord/tenant relationship—they have a quasi-property interests, like the right to privacy in their boardinghouses.

**Rule:** Your absolute property rights are qualified by the **necessity of others** residing or occupying your property who also have property interests, and/or by those who are **privileged** to enter for certain protected reasons.

**JUSTIFICATIONS**

1. **Expectations/reliance**—the farmworkers have come to rely on the idea that they can receive visitors, and a reasonable person would assume that the plaintiff should know about this expectation/reliance. To the point where it would become unreasonable to disallow them to have visitors.
   1. It is different if the plaintiff bars the defendants on day 1, rather than more than a year out—the longer the workers are there, they more they *rely* on the good will of the plaintiff.
2. **Radin**/***Moore v. Regents***—You cannot alienate personal, fundamental rights for money
   1. “*Rights are too fundamental* to be denied on the bases of an interest in real property and too fragile to be left to the unequal bargaining strength of parties.” (**Radin**)
   2. Same worry as *Moore*, about creating a “black market” that makes a human body a commodity;
   3. Risk of **unequal bargaining power** and **exploitation**: “[T]he needs of the occupants may be so imperative and their strength so weak, that the law will deny the occupants the opportunity to contract away what is deemed essential to their health, welfare, and dignity.”
3. Risk of **slippery slope**—if one group of farmworkers contracted their rights away, there would be a race to the bottom of owners demanding farmers contract their rights away.
4. Your rights are relative, you cannot do everything you want on your land if others have interests that affect and are affected by your land.

**Three** main ways to think about why the court came out the way it did:

* 1. The court was working with a **common law definition of “privilege”** to determine that the Defendants were not trespassers under the **public policy exception.**
  2. The court was concerned about the worker’s **expectations** and **reliance interests** on the plaintiff’s good will.
  3. \*The court was depriving the workers the ability to alienate/contract away certain rights because they were too tied up in personhood, and it was worried about setting a baseline expectation that the rights will be contracted away.

**IMPLICATIONS**—Maybe you have lost the right to exclude because of the workers’ consent and reliance issues, or may you never had it to begin with, because certain types of people are privileged to enter.

***Commonwealth v. Magadini (M.A. 2016):* Necessity as privileged entry**

* Facts**:** Defendant was homeless and entered buildings he was barred from by no-trespass orders. Six different charges against the defendant are challenged in this case. In each circumstance he trespassed the property after being barred from them.
  1. Requested a jury instruction on the defense of **necessity**, asserting that his conduct was justified as the only lawful alternative for a homeless person facing the “clear and imminent danger” of exposure to the elements during periods of extreme outdoor temperatures.
  2. ISSUE—Did Magadini meet the requirements for defense of necessity to the jury (just jury instruction, not whether the jury would rule on it)?
* Holding: Trial court committed error in refusing the defendant’s request for a jury instruction on the necessity defense when, as here, the defendant satisfied the foundational elements entitling him to the defense by showing that there was “reasonable doubt” about the availability of legal alternatives to abate a clear and imminent danger. There was “little question” that the weather conditions presented a “clear and imminent danger” for a homeless person.

**Four-part test** to meet the requirements:

* 1. There must be clear and imminent danger that is not speculative.
  2. There must be a reasonable expectation that the action will be effective.
  3. There must be no legal alternative that will abate the danger.
     + Magadini’s evidence: He stayed in an outdoor gazebo year-round, he was told to leave the only homeless shelter and had been denied previously during a blizzard. Unable to rent an apartment and could only stay at public parks.
     + Court: the alternatives the plaintiff presented—like going to a shelter in another town—were NOT effective alternatives. The standard is NOT that the defendant must consider *all* possible alternatives when he is in clear and present danger.
  4. The legislature has not acted to preclude the defense.

The four-part test is a balancing of harm: you can claim the necessity defense if the harm to yourself of *not* alleviating the danger is greater than the harm inflicted by alleviating the danger.

* **Justification: Efficient**—creating incentives to minimize harm as much as possible by, for example, sleeping in a public area rather than knocking on people’s homes

***Jacque c. Steenberg Homes (Wi. 1997)***

* Facts: Steenberg Homes sold a mobile home to a neighbor of the Jacques. Because of snow on the nearest town road, the easiest way for Steenberg to deliver the mobile home was over the Jacques’ property. However, the Jacques refused to grant Steenberg permission to do so. Steenberg proceeded to deliver the mobile home across the Jacques’ property anyway. The Jacques notified the sheriff, and Steenberg was issued a $30 citation. Jury awarded the Jacques $1 nominal in damages and $100,000 in punitive damages.
  + Arguments:
    - Steenberg: a jury cannot award punitive damages in this case because there were no actual damages.
    - Jacques: individuals and society want to deter trespass regardless of measurable harm that results.
* Holding: the Wi. SC said that there is a harm in trespass in the intrusion in the property owner’s right. If you infringe upon the right then you lose the right.
* Reasoning:
  + Enforcing Rights: The actual harm here is not in any physical damage to the land, but in the denial of the owner's legal right to exclude all others. Private landowner’s right to exclude is **“one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.” *Dolan v. City of Tigard* (1994). A right is unreal if it is unenforceable.**
  + Individual Interests: There’s a strong individual interest in right to exclude. That individual right requires protection from state. Every trespass causes actual harm, regardless of whether compensatory damages
  + Societal Interests: Promote integrity of and reliance on legal system. Punitive damages are necessary to prevent further wrongdoing. Interest in preserving integrity of legal system, and if not self-help will happen. (Bentham)

Note:

* The general rule in Wisconsin is that punitive damages are unavailable if unsupported by compensatory damages. *Barnard v. Cohen* (1917). The rationale for this is simply that society’s interest in deterring unlawful but unharmful conduct is not great enough to warrant punitive damages.
* Nevertheless, the question of whether punitive damages are available when supported by a nominal damage award for intentional trespass has not been answered.
* An exception to *Barnard* is warranted in cases of intentional trespass. Repeated trespasses could actually threaten the individual’s ownership by giving the trespasser rights by prescription or adverse possession.

### ADVERSE POSSESSION: FROM TRESPASS TO TITLE

**CASES**: *Brown v. Gobble*; *Nome 2000 v. Fagerstrom*

Unprivileged entry onto land possessed by another is a trespass, but title may pass from the true owner to that trespasser if the possession of land is: CHOSE

1. **C**ontinuous
2. **H**ostile
3. **O**pen and Notorious
4. For the **S**tatutory period
5. **E**xclusive

**THREE WAYS ADVERSE POSSESSION CLAIMS CAN BE BROUGHT**

1. As a claim to **quiet title** against the record owner, where the claimant seeks a declaratory judgment that the adverse possessor has become the owner of the disputed property
2. As a defense to trespass
3. As a defense to ejectment (*Nome 2000*)

JUSTIFICATIONS FOR ADVERSE POSSESSION

* **Stale claims/Promotes alienability** – Uncertainty inhibits transactions or raises their costs, thereby lowering their profitability.
  1. People can sell only what they own, but if unclear what they own, inhibited from entering transactions because of the risk that they will not in fact be buying/selling what they are purporting to
* **Quieting title / Administrability** – giving root of title you extinguish potential litigation baggage that could drag down market for real estate. Don't have to re-litigate every time try to transfer right of possession to next person
* **Penalizing the sleeping owner** – Prevents valuable resources from being left idle, efficiency concern
* **Efficiency** – Lowers the cost of identifying who the owner is
* **Reliance** – Protecting the possessor’s interests and expectations
* **Locke** – Your labor.
* **Cooter & Ulen**: Two economic justifications for adverse possession:

1. By quieting title & closing off stale claims, AP “lowers the cost of establishing rightful ownership claims by removing the risk that ownership will be disputed on the basis of the distant past.”
2. Prevents valuable resources from being left idle for long periods of time by specifying procedures for a productive user to take title from an unproductive user.

* **Sterk**: Willingness to pay is a poor metric for measuring degree to which adverse possessor values the property.
* **Penaver & Kaytal**: AP’s long-term use/improvement of the property, combined with the risk of civil/criminal sanctions, will in many cases constitute strong prima facie evidence that adverse possessor places high value on the property.
* **Radin**: Translates Holmes’ explanation into language of justice/fairness. Fungible v. personal property. AP’s interest is initially fungible but becomes increasingly personal with time, while titleholder’s interest moves oppositely, and finally to nothingness. Timing where attachment/detachment demands a switch requires a moral judgment.
* **Merrill**: Moral basis for adverse possession lies in “the reliance interests that the possessor may have developed through longstanding possession of the property.” Adverse possession is justified by moral principle of protecting reliance on relationships.

**Analysis Against Adverse possession:**

* Not **efficient**: rewards wrongdoing;
* But perhaps **socially useful** (Locke)—good for underutilized property to go towards a more productive use;
* And there is an **efficiency** argument in that it would encourage landowners to defend their land.
* **Good Faith** (like the Gobbles): In some jurisdictions, only those who mistakenly occupy property owned by someone else can acquire ownership

Adverse possession is very jurisdictional and have to look to states common law and statutory law to determine parameters of it. Property law is an accumulation of laws over time.

SIX ELEMENTS OF ADVERSE POSSESSION: CHOSE

1. Possession must be **Continuous** through the statutory period;
   1. The possessor must exercise control over a property in ways **customarily pursued by owners of that type of property.**
      1. Extended absences or seasonal uses cannot be used to defeat the claim if that is normal use of the land.
   2. **Tacking** can be used to establish continuous use. This uses successive periods of occupation to establish required statute of limitations.
      1. Passed down through Privity (voluntary relinquishment of possession by the earlier AP in favor of the later one)
      2. “To tack different adverse possessions to make up the period of bar the persons holding such possessions must be connected by privity of title or claim.” (*Brown v. Gobble*)
      3. It doesn’t count if the successor dispossessed the original owner forcibly.
   3. Loses continuous is True owner asserts possession before adverse possession ripens.
   4. If AP for 5 years and then another person tries to AP for a few years and then you return and AP, you only need 5 years
2. Possession must be **adverse or Hostile**
   1. The possessor’s use must be **Non-permissive**—there’s a presumption that possession of another’s property is usually non-permissive.
      1. This means that if the owner does nothing it means that it is adverse.
   2. Majority rule uses an **objective test**: the possessor’s state of mind is irrelevant, you only need a lack of permission and consistent usage that an average owner would do.
      1. **BUT** to acquire AP against a co-owner, you need to make an explicit statement of intent to take possession—an **ouster**.
      2. **AND** possession that was originally permissive stays that way until the owner makes an explicit statement otherwise.
   3. Minority rule has three possible subjective tests:
      1. **Claim of right**: Adverse possessor must allege a “claim of right” like an intention to appropriate land—some states will defeat an adverse possession claim where the possessor knew where the boundary was but never *intended to claim* property outside her borders as her own.
         1. **Intentional dispossession**: the adverse possessor must be aware she is occupying property owned by someone else and must intend to oust or dispossess.
3. Possession must be **Open and notorious**
   1. Possessory acts must be sufficiently visible and obvious to put a **reasonable owner on notice** that her property is being occupied by a non-owner, like:
      1. Enclosing land in a fence or a wall (*Brown v. Gobble*)
      2. Building a structure or laying down a driveway
      3. Mowing grass, clearing trees, clearing land, etc.
      4. Isolated clearing of trees, but not enclosing, is **not enough**.
4. The **Statute of Limitations must pass**
   1. **Tacking** can be used to establish the passage of the statute of limitations
   2. If the owner of the property has disability (minor etc.), then the statute of limitations will be **tolled**
      1. But if clock has already started on statue of limitations, then the onset of disability will NOT stop it.
   3. Some states lower the statute of limitations when the possessor has **color of title**
   4. State dependent. Usually 10-20 years, but TX has 40.
5. Possession must be **Exclusive**
   1. The use “is of a type that would be expected of a true owner of the land in question” and that “the adverse claimant’s possession cannot be shared with the true owner.” (*Nome 2000)*.
   2. Occasioned entry by the true owner is NOT enough to defeat the claim.
   3. Two adverse possessors can become co-owners—you just have to exclude the true owner.
6. **Occupancy:** Possession must be **actual possession** – physical occupation;
   1. The adverse possessor must physically occupy the land and put it to “ordinary use to which the land is capable and such as an owner would make of it.” (*Smith v. Hayden*)
      1. Can be shown by enclosing it in a fence—but not a “fence of convenience,” such as one to keep out animals, that does not count.
      2. Can also be shown by building on it, improving on it, **acting as an** **average owner** would—that’s the most key part.
   2. May be established with **color of title** if the deed is defective.
7. Some states also require **color of title** or **payment of property taxes** (*Romero*)

**COLOR OF TITLE**

AP assumes possession in reliance on a document that seems to convey title, but for some reason is legally insufficient to convey title. (Ex: Deed that is void, or deed from fake-owner)

1. **Justifications**/critiques:
   1. It’s **fair**—it protects expectations of passage of title from one person to another, and all the bundle of rights that are transferred;
   2. It’s **inefficient**—it incentivizes sloppiness.
2. **Constructive possession**—Adverse possession of *any* portion of land described in a document providing color of title is sufficient to establish adverse possession over *all* of the land described in the document.
3. A defective deed/intended conveyance does not usually constitute permission and defeat the adverse and hostile element of adverse possession.

**HOW TO DEFEAT ADVERSE POSSESSION CLAIMS**

1. Give **permission**—defeats the adverse or hostile element
2. File suit before the end of the statutory period

**OTHER ELEMENTS OF ADVERSE POSSESSION DOCTRINE**

1. It is generally held that adverse possession claims will NOT prevail against **government property**—although some states have abolished government immunity
   1. 43 U.S.C. §1068—you can have adverse possession of federal land if it has been occupied (1) for over 20 years; (2) in good faith on a claim of color of title; and (3) cultivated/constructive/improved upon.
2. Adverse possessors usually get non-possessory interests as well, like mineral interests.
3. There are still questions about what is necessary for an adverse possessor to use rural land as an “average owner” would, and whether the acts to be open and notorious must be greater to properly give notice to a reasonable owner.

#### **Brown v. Gobble (tacking and adverse possession) (W. Va. 1996)**

* Facts**:** The Gobbles (defendants) and Browns (plaintiffs) were owners of neighboring properties in West Virginia. The properties were divided by a 2 ft wide tract of land that appeared to be part of Gobble property, b/c was enclosed on the Gobbles’ side of the property line by a fence. But was owned by the Browns, who also bought property by deed which included enclosed tract as theirs. Browns decided to build a road along the tract, Gobbles asserted it was theirs, Browns sued to enjoin the Gobbles from using tract. At the time of the suit, the Gobbles had been in possession for only 9.5 years, when the statute of limitations required 10 years.
* Holding—The Gobbles had satisfied all elements of adverse possession
* Rule: Tacking can be used to establish continuous possession of the disputed land—at the time of the suit, the Gobbles had been in possession for only 9.5 years, when the statute of limitations required 10 years. But the previous owners had owned it for longer and that got over the required 10 years.

**JUSTIFICATION**

1. **Actual possession**;
   1. Gobbles had kept a garden, fenced it in, cared for and developed the land.
2. **Exclusive**;
   1. Original owners of the Browns’ land testified that they never objected to the Gobbles’ or their predecessor’s claim;
   2. The Gobbles had exclusive control and dominion.
3. **Open** and **Notorious**;
   1. Witnesses agreed that the reputation of the land was that it belonged to the Gobbles’ prior owners;
   2. Enough to put the Browns on **notice**.
4. **Continuous**;
   1. Without the tacking doctrine, the Gobbles’ could only claim to be in possession for 9.5 years, which would fall short of the 10-year statutory period;
   2. BUT with the tacking doctrine, which the court accepted, the Gobbles could trace possession as far back as 1937 through two prior owners.
5. **Adverse** or **hostile**;
   1. The tract had been fenced in since 1937, and prior owners claimed that the tract was theirs.
6. For a prescribed **statutory period** (usually 10 years)—see element above.

#### **Nome 2000 v. Fagerstrom (use as an average owner on only a portion of land) (Alaska 1990)**

* Facts: Nome 2000 is the record title holder of the entire parcel. Fagerstroms used northern parcel of land seasonally—it was not suited for winter residency—for several years. Put stakes down in the parcel, built shelter, then cabin. During that time, they let others use the entire property for picking berries, going on walks, enjoying the waterfront. Only used southern parcel for recreation on preexisting trails and picking up trash. Nome 2000 sued to eject Fagerstroms, who counterclaimed that they acquired the parcel by adverse possession. Jury found for the Fagerstroms, Nome 2000 appealed, arguing that the adverse possession elements were not satisfied, and that even if they were, the Fagerstroms only acquired the northern section of the parcel.
  1. **ISSUE**—Did the Fagerstroms satisfy the requirements for adverse possession for both the northern and southern parcels
* Holding: Yes they did. The Jury could have concluded clear and convincing evidence of adverse possession. The Fagerstroms have title to the northern portion, case remanded back to the lower court on the southern portion.
  1. Nome 2000 argued that the Fagerstrom’s use was consistent with Native Alaskan “stewardship,” which didn’t satisfy the adverse possession element of hostility.
  2. Court disagreed: exclusive use is relative to the type of land, and since this is rural land, the **Fagerstroms used it as an average rural owner would** by letting people wander on it.
     1. Baseline should be for rural property, NOT suburban type property.

### Prescriptive Easements: From Trespass to Use Rights

**Key distinction between adverse possession (AP) and prescriptive easement (PE):** The underlying purpose of adverse possession is converting a trespasser into an owner. This is not true of easement which converts trespasser into user.

* This underscores the system of property law as land of set of interests and organizes the world into categories.
* Real property, or land, we have 2 different categories of interest: (1) Possessory (full dominion over land – AP) and (2) non-possessory (right to USE land owned by another – PE).
* Fee interest is a type of interest that confers a title that potentially lasts forever. **This fee simple absolute – full bundle of sticks.**
* Require all the elements of AP, but a significant MINORITY OF STATES differ in that they say that PE uses are presumptively permissive (*Johnson v. Coshatt*)

#### **Community Feed Store v. Northeastern (prescriptive easement) (Vt. 1989)**

**FACTS**

1. Operator of an animal feed business claimed it obtained a prescriptive easement over part of the driveway on the neighbor’s land. D had put up a barrier in front of driveway to single it is their property.
   1. P used lot to load trucks and receive customers coming to pick up feed and to receive shipments.
   2. D countersues to eject from their land – they have chain of title.
   3. Non-fee interest 🡪 not seeking to acquire title
2. Lower court held that the feed store (1) failed to prove with “sufficient particularity” the dimensions of the easement, and (2) that the use of the area was made with permission of the defendant.
   1. Need open, notorious, hostile, continuous, statutory period, acquiescence by the owner.
   2. Trial court had assumed that it was public use, and if we have use by public then we have presumption of permission and then we fail PE claim.

**ISSUE**: Does the feed store have a prescriptive easement over the other company’s driveway?

**HOLDING**—Yes they do, because it was open, notorious, continuous and adverse for a period longer than the statutory requirement (15 years—they had chain of title back to 1929)

* B/c it was open and notorious it was presumed to be adverse, and general use is enough. Don’t need particularity.

**RULE**: “General outlines rather than minute details of the interest” are enough to establish easement by prescription;

1. You just need to show that it is consistent with the pattern of use
   1. They showed that the gravel area at issue was 60’ x 90’;
   2. They showed the extent of the feed store’s land;
   3. They submitted photographs and drew a diagram.
2. Uses Restatement 477 and *Warsaw v. Chicago Metallic* (CA) as precedent
3. *Nome* Alaska case could be used as proof either way – northern v. southern tract of land.

Assent was NOT at issue in this case, but it is required.

* Lost grant theory of the past. But seems to be a vestige of the past and maybe should be gotten rid of b/c it conflicts with the hostile aspect.
  + 3 different approaches to acquiescence **(p.319)** 🡪 in two forms it is basically duplicative of hostile. The third view is that the owner knew or should have known of use.
* *State v. Shack* 🡪 where the court described the common law as evolving and incorporating new policies.

NY and other legislatures are trying to clarify these doctrines. Brings us to larger set of question on whether this is the right set of doctrines to have – policy issues.

Looking at the Zuni case less for the doctrine, and more to the larger consequences of using this doctrine.

***Zuni Tribe v. Early Platt (AZ, 1990)***

* Facts: Zuni tribe had been making pilgrimage to a holy burial site for a long time – Have been going on pilgrimage for sure since 1924, and possibly since 1500s. Path goes through Apache County in Arizona, 18-20 miles of which is leased by Early Platt.
  + Pilgrimages cut or take down pilgrims in their way and will only change the route for natural obstacles.
  + Route has been open, visible, and known to the community. No showing that they had sought to cross lands under permission or by authority of other persons.
* AZ law provides for adverse possession to occur: actual, open and notorious, hostile under a claim of right, continuous for the statutory period of 10 years, and exclusive
  + Burden of proof for permissive use is on owner
* Hostile and claim of right crossing

## Property Open to Public

### The Civil Rights Act

FEDERAL STATUTES

**Civil Rights Act of 1866**

* (42 U.S.C. § 1981) All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts....as is enjoyed by white citizens. The term “make and enforce contracts” includes the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship
* (42 U.S.C. § 1982) All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.

**Civil Rights Act of 1964** (Title II)

* All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin.

**1964 v. 1866 CIVIL RIGHTS ACTS**

1. 1964: makes no provisions for damages, only injunctive relief;
2. 1866: only talks about race, and provides for damages
   1. From *Jones v. Alfred Mayer* and the Civil Rights Act of 1991--§ 1981 regulates **private conduct**

### HYPOTHETICAL—Patricia Williams

1. Retail stores are not explicitly mentioned in the 1964 Act—what can she do to argue that it is a public accommodation?
   1. She can refer to the 1866 Act and argue that she was denied the right to contract;
      1. (**Note**: Courts recently held that the 1866 act extended to establishments not listed in 1964—like hairdressers, for example)
   2. Can make an **interpretive** argument—Congress couldn’t have possibly listed all possible places of public accommodation, and it could have said that the list was exhaustive, but it didn’t;
      1. It’s intentionally broad to include things that it didn’t explicitly mention.
   3. She would also need to surmount the “private establishment” exception and argue that just having a buzzer doesn’t make Benetton a private establishment.

**STATE STATUTES**

1. Three-part test to determine if the statute applies:
   1. Do you count as a protected class under that statute?
   2. Does the place discriminating against you count as a place of public accommodation?
   3. Are there any exceptions that would make the place fall out of the statute?
2. State law may go further than federal law in protecting individual rights—they are not preempted under the Supremacy Clause unless they are *inconsistent* with federal law.
3. New York Executive Law §§ 292-96 (pg. 48):
   1. Broader list of public accommodations, including retail stores;
   2. Private club exception—not private if it has more than one hundred members, provides regular meal service, and regularly receives payment for dues, fees…meals or beverages directly or indirectly from or on behalf of a nonmember;
   3. Protected classes—race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, military status, sex, or disability or marital status of any person…
   4. Covers communications and materials indicated protected classes are unwelcome, objectionable, or not acceptable, etc.

**GENERAL RULE**: When a property owner opens his or her property to the general public, they have the right to exclude others for any reason not specifically prohibited by federal laws, provided: the property is not an inn or common carrier, which have a duty to serve the public (*Madden v. Queens*, NY 1947).

**COMMON CARRIERS & INNKEEPER EXCEPTION:** Property owners have an **absolute right to exclude** others from their commercial property for any reason not specifically prohibited by statute, **unless they are a common carrier.** Justifications for rule:

* **Socially useful**: since common carriers are monopolies, denial of service is like a denial to the right to travel or seek shelter
* **Necessity**: common carriers provide necessities whose denial would place individuals at risk
* **Fair** (reliance/expectations): the public relies on the expectation that common carriers are available to serve public needs

**USTON OUTLIER**: When a property owner opens his or her property to the general public in the pursuit of their own property interest, they have a duty NOT to act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner toward persons who come on their premises.

* *Uston* reflects an older view of property rights from the mid-19th century that CHANGED when courts began to ALLOWED commercial entities to exclude African Americans
* Effectively: **you need a good reason to exclude someone**, otherwise you have a duty to serve. Cannot exclude unreasonably.

***Uston v. Resorts* (NJ 1982): THE NARROWING OF THE DUTY TO SERVE**

* Facts: Resorts refused to allow Uston near the blackjack tables at its casino because Uston’s strategy of card counting increased his odds of winning. Uston claimed no right to exclude him b/c of playing strategy. Resorts argued it had right to exclude arbitrarily.
* Holding: Resorts does NOT have the right to exclude arbitrarily. An individual has a right of reasonable access to property open to the public.
  + The **reasonableness** of a decision to exclude an individual must be determined on a case-by-case basis.
  + Here, Resorts’ casino is open to the public and Uston’s desire to enter the casino and play blackjack is not unreasonable (not acting unreasonably either; not disrupting operations nor threatening any occupants’ security).
* Importance: This is the minority rule.
  + **Majority rule:** you CAN exclude arbitrarily unless you are an innkeeper or a common carrier (in those cases, minority rule governs).
* Rule: When property owners open their premises to the general public in the pursuit of their own property interests, they have NO right to exclude people arbitrarily.
  + Duty not to act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner b/c an individual has a right of reasonable access to property open to the public.
  + The only time it is “reasonable” to exclude is in cases of disruptive conduct or when it threatens security.

Notes:

* Unlike *State v. Shack*: no unequal bargaining power, no fundamental right to state services implicated.
* **Outlier**: In most jurisdictions, the majority common law rule is that when a property owner opens his or her property to the general public, they have the right to exclude others for any reason not specifically prohibited by federal laws provided they are not an inn or common carrier, which have a duty to serve the public. (*Madden v. Queens County Jockey Club,* NY 1947)

***Arguello v. Conoco* (5th Cir., 2003):**

* Facts: Father and daughter Arguello stopped at Conoco store to buy gasoline and other goods. Subjected to racially discriminatory treatment by clerk.
* Holding: No valid claim for racial discrimination under Civil Rights Act of 1866 §1981. No agency relationship.
* Reasoning: Cannot establish that their attempt to contract was thwarted. Father voluntarily left good on the counter. When he later tried to gain access to the store and was locked out, he wasn’t denied an opportunity to purchase because his intention was to determine the clerk’s identity, not to buy something. The daughter also does not have a valid claim because she was able to successfully complete the transaction.
* Rule: To state a claim under the **Civil Rights Act of 1866** **§1981 in** retail context, MUST demonstrate loss of an actual (not speculative or prospective) contract interest (an attempt to contract that was thwarted by merchant).
  + Court will NOT recognize claims with respect to conduct occurring after the consummation of the sales contract.
* Other Rule: In order for an employer to be held liable for discriminatory acts of its employees under federal statutes, an **agency relationship must be established**.
* An agency relationship exists between: an employer and an employee who performs acts unacceptable to the employer in the course of employment. Factors:
  + Time, place, purpose of act
  + Acts similar to those authorized to do
  + Extent to which departed from normal methods
  + Whether employer would reasonably expect employee to act in racist manner
* An agency relationship does NOT exist between a company and stores displaying the company’s brand if the company is NOT involved in the store’s day-to-day operations.

      1. One of more major life activities, as defined in 12102(2)
   3. Discrimination (§12182)

* Failure to do something

1. By a **Public Accommodation**? (§12181)

* “Disability is defined as (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of an individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.”
* Whether the condition is a physical or mental impairment
* Whether the life activity it implicated constitutes a major life activity
* Whether the impairment substantially limited the major life activity. (Met even if difficulties are not insurmountable like HIV.)

**Elements of an ADA Claim:**

* + - 1. Discriminated on the basis of, as defined in §12182 and §12183 (new construction)
      2. Disability, as defined in §12102
      3. In a public accommodation, as defined by §12181(7)
      4. Not a private club, as defined by Title II of Civil Rights Act

**Law School Hypo 1: Law School Dorm and attendant**

* Competing concerns of cost considerations vs. fairness
* How to define “Readily” accessible is the important phrase here
* Law School’s Argument:
  + Under **§ 12182(a),** the student still has full and equal enjoyment of facilities; the student is using more facilities and must pay for them.
  + Under **§ 12182(b)(1)(A(i),** the student isn’t being denied an opportunity to participate in dorm life or the law school;
  + Under **§ 12182(b)(2)(A)(i),** the law school isn’t adopting eligibility criteria that screens out the student;
  + Under **§ 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii),** the law school isn’t failing to make reasonable modifications, because it would not be reasonable to give the student two rooms and deny one to another school. Even if it were reasonable, providing the student with two rooms would fundamentally alter the nature of dorm life.
* **Law Student’s Arguments**
  + Under **§ 12182(a),** the student is being denied full and equal enjoyment of facilities; he has being forced to pay twice as much to live in the dorm, which is not equal.
  + Under **§ 12182(b)(1)(A(i),** the student is being denied an opportunity to participate in dorm life of the law school, because he has two pay twice as much.
  + Under **§ 12182(b)(2)(A)(i),** the law school is effectively adopting eligibility criteria that effectively screens out the student. Moreover, this requirement isn’t necessary for the provision of dormitory rooms.
  + Under **§ 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii),** the law school has failed to make reasonable modifications, “Reasonable” does not require cost calculations and would not fundamentally alter the nature of dorm life.
* **Discrimination? § 12182(b)(2)(A)(i): Defining “What’s Necessary For”**
  + The law student could argue that cost considerations are irrelevant in determining what is necessary, i.e. high cost to the law school is irrelevant. To support this reading, the law student could argue that, unlike in Subparagraphs IV & V, there is no “readily achievable” proviso, and according to § 12181(9), readily achievable involves cost considerations.
  + The law student could also argue that Congress didn’t intend for cost to be a major consideration, and endeavor to argue that the purpose of the statute is to preserve human dignity and provide access regardless of cost.
  + The law school could counter that the ADA is different from Title II, which doesn’t have all of the limiting provisions that exist in the ADA.

***Bragdon v. Abbott* (1998): APPLYING THE ADA**

* Facts: Defendant is affected by asymptomatic HIV. On dental office info form, disclosed HIV-positive status. After exam, Bragdon informed Abbott of his policy not to fill cavities of HIV-positive patients. Offered to perform the procedure at a hospital, but Abbott would be responsible for cost of using hospital facilities.
  + Abbott declined and sued Bragdon under the ADA, alleging discrimination on the basis of her disability.
* Holding: HIV meets statutory definition of disability under the ADA, and so this is discrimination.
  + HIV is a disability with an impairment from the moment of infection – it follows an “unalterable course” that involves an immediate hit to the immune system followed by other impairments. Interrupts and substantially limits reproduction, a **major life activity**. Financial consequences: costs of therapy, long-term healthcare.
    - ADA disability definition
  + Dentist’s office is a place of public accommodation
    - ADA “professional office of a health care provider”
  + The service would not endanger the healthcare provider
    - ADA prohibits refusing service here
* Importance: ADA’s definition of disability is non-exhaustive.
* Rule: The assessment of whether a significant risk to the health and safety of others exists should be determined by the treatment provider and be based on medical or other objective evidence.

Note:

* ACLU Amicus Brief, *Bragdon v. Abbott*: “All individuals with asymptomatic HIV infection have a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more of their major life activities. HIV substantially limits reproduction, sexual intimacy, caring for one’s self; interactions with others, and more fundamentally, life itself.”

*CIDNY v. MTA* (2017):

Importance: ADA seeks to eradicate disability-based discrimination conducted by public entities.

Complaint: MTA is a public entity. Claim – breach of duty: “fail to operate a designated public transportation program or activity…when viewed in its entirety, the program or activity is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.”

* Bill of Rights constrains the actions of the state, NOT of private actors**.** State Action Doctrine is solution to a problem that emerged after the 14th Amendment: What is the reach of equal opportunity & privileges and immunities?
* **OLD RULE**: Focus should be on the states, and prohibiting them from denying freed slaves constitutional rights. Private actors can do what they want.
  1. *Hudgens v. NLRB*: “It is, of course, a commonplace that the constitutional guarantees of free speech is a guarantee only against abridgment by government, federal or state
* **NEW RULE**: Equal opportunity duties can limit private property if the private property is acting as a state does.
  1. When this does happen—*Marsh v. Alabama* (company town); *State v. Shack*
  2. When this doesn’t—*Lloyd Corp.* (malls).

HOW TO APPLY THE NEW RULE

1. **Figure out which source of law you’re operating under**
2. Figure out what the requirements are
   1. If you’re **under federal Constitution**—there must be a clear public square where you would not be able to get word out if that public square denied access or speech
   2. If you’re **under state law**—can be more expansive than the Constitution, so a place like a mall might apply (CA and NJ have granted free speech in shopping malls)

**Policy Reasons Why Public Actors Should Have Greater Duty Than Private Actors:**

* Monopoly over force
* Monopoly over facilities/services 🡪 Congress has monopoly over this
* Democracy-enhancing effects: State is legislatively elected body, so presumably confident in representativeness.
* Legitimacy: Protect settled public expectations of 1st Amendment values upheld in public square, which don’t apply in private settings

***Marsh* Rule:** Formulating Two Possible Approaches To Deciding State Action

1. Public Use Standard – “The more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it.”
2. Public Function Test – “A private entity that owns all the property and controls all the municipal functions of an entire town is a state actor that must run the town in compliance with the Constitution.” (*Prager v. Google*’s description of Marsh’s holding).
   1. A facility that is built and operated primarily to benefit the public and whose operation is essentially a public function is a state actor for purposes of 1st/14th Amendment analysis.

***Marsh v. Alabama* (1946): PRIVATELY OWNED COMPANY TOWN - LOOSENED DOCTRINE**

* Facts: Town of Chickasaw, Alabama was owned by a private corporation, Gulf Shipbuilding Company. With the exception of its private ownership, the town operated as any other and was bordered by and indistinguishable from surrounding municipalities. Marsh was a Jehovah’s Witness who stood on sidewalk distributing religious literature. Was told she could not distribute without a permit and that no permit would be issued to her. Protested, arrested, charged with violating Alabama state law. Argued that her activities were protected under 1st and 14th Amendments. District and circuit courts rejected because she was on private property (old rule of the state action doctrine).
* Holding: A privately-owned town cannot deny traditional 1st and 14th Amendment protections of speech and religion to individuals because it is acting like a state. Alabama state statute that enforces the denial of these protections is in violation. Alabama cannot suspend people’s 1st and 14th Amendment rights while they are in the town because the Company has opened up the town to the public, and many residents from other surrounding areas frequently use the town for commercial purposes.
* Importance: Right to free speech/access in company towns. The more publicly you open your land, the more subject to regulation. In balancing the interests of the Company as property owners, with the interests of the people in freedom of press and religion, the latter are more important.
* Rule: The 1st and 14th Amendment protections of speech and religion still apply to individuals when operating in a privately-owned town if the town is open to the public and used for public purposes. Regardless of whether a corporation or municipality owns the town, the public it allows in has an identical interest in the town’s functionality and the freedom of communication within its borders.

After *Marsh v. Alabama*, TWO BIG THINGS HAPPENED:

1. The sit-in movement—businesses started excluding patrons based on race, so civil rights protestors would take a seat at a diner counter and refuse to leave.
   1. Argument: even though it looked like only a private actor was excluding you, it was the state’s arbitrary exclusion laws that were allowing them to do it.
2. Civil Rights Act passed.

*Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner* (1972): **MALL - TIGHTENED STATE ACTION DOCTRINE**

* Facts: Lloyd Corp. owned a large shopping mall. Area completely enclosed with landscaped “malls” running throughout. Tanner was a member of a group that quietly/orderly passed out handbills on one of the malls. Handbills invited members of general public to a meeting of the “Resistance Community” to protest the draft and the Vietnam War. A customer complained, and a guard told plaintiffs they would be arrested for trespassing if did not leave. Tanner filed suit arguing that shopping mall’s policies violated their First Amendment rights to distribute anti-war literature.
* Holding: Malls are not company towns for purposes of free speech/access rights. Would stretch *Marsh* logic too far, since mall does not assume full spectrum of state/municipal powers/functions. *Marsh* involved the assumption that a private enterprise does have attributes of a state-created municipality and exercises semi-official municipal functions as a delegate of the state.
* Dissent, Marshall: The mall is clearly equivalent to a public business district. Civic entities have access: there are doctors, dentists, lawyers, bankers, travel agents. Constitutional concern: moreover, for people who don’t have an easily accessible platform, hand-billing may be their only way to get the word out. Slippery slope worry – unless we adhere to *Marsh*, “only the wealthy may find effective communication possible”
* Importance: Malls are not company towns for purposes of free speech/access rights. Property does not lose its private character merely bc the public is invited to use it for designated purposes; size is not dispositive characteristic. Narrows *Marsh* to only apply to company town (unique/anachronistic historical phenomenon).
* Rule: A private business may constitutionally exclude the distribution of handbills on its property when those handbills are completely unrelated to the business’ functions, and there are alternative means for distributors to relay the message.

Note: *Marsh* Public Function Test narrowly defined here under *Lloyd*, but can be read more broadly

* \*In *State v. Shack* the NJ SC decided to rule based on NJ common law as opposed to 1st Amendment b/c the NJ ruling/interpretation of the 1st A would be subject to the US SC interpretation of the A.

***Prager v. Google* (N. Dist. Cal., 2018): INTERNET**

* Facts: Prager University sued Google/YouTube for censorship of its some of its politically conservative YouTube videos. YouTube placed some of the videos into “restricted mode,” which blocks the videos’ availability to YouTube users who voluntarily operate in that mode. Prager claimed the censorship was anti-conservative discrimination + that YouTube is like a company town in *Marsh*: performs traditional government functions.
* Holding: *Marsh* cannot be extended to support Prager’s contention that YouTube should be treated as a state actor subject to 1st Amendment scrutiny, just bc it extends and operates its private property as a forum for expression of diverse viewpoints. Prager did not show that YouTube/Google engaged in any one of the “very few” public functions that have been traditionally “exclusively reserved to the State.”
* Importance: *Lloyd*, post-*Marsh* demonstrates that *Marsh* reach is narrow.
* Rule: Not a state actor obligated to uphold 1st Amendment protections under Marsh state action doctrine if not engaged in one of the “very few” public functions that have been traditionally “exclusively reserved to the State.”

***Dale v. Boy Scouts of America*** (U.S. 2000) (p. 53)

* Reversed a NJ court’s decision requiring the boy scouts to allow gay members.
* Rule: The First Amendment right to expressive association may in some cases be an exception to public accommodations laws.

The First A: The general rule 🡪 Constitutional guarantee is only a guarantee against government abridgement, federal or state. Things get complicated when we try and step past that.

**Why we create 1st A rights of access for government owned property:**

1. *Monopoly rationale*. Government-owned property may be the only public forum that exists, i.e. there is only one U.S. Congress; only one City Council; only one State House.
2. *Democracy rationale*. Government-owned property is often a formal venue for making and enforcing laws, a process in which all citizens have a right to participate.
3. *Necessity rationale*. Government-owned property is often the site of lawmaking that, to be effective and legitimate, requires the free-flow exchange of information.
4. *Coercion rationale*. Government-owned property is often more immediately protected by the state, such that without a right of access, government could exercise its power to exclude through coercion.
5. *Reliance/Expectations rationale*. People expect access to government-owned property; in addition, government-property is effectively “owned” by the people who in turn, have a settled expectation that they can access the property.

In reaching this holding, the Court offered at least two different formulations of the test, prompting considerable debate among subsequent Justices and litigants as to what rule of law *Marsh* stands for.

1. **“Public Forum Test.”** On the one hand, *Marsh* could be read as standing for a broad right of access, i.e. “the more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights became circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it.”
2. **“Public Function Test.”** On the other hand, *Marsh* could–and has—been read as creating a narrow right of access, i.e. as establishing a bright-line rule that “a private entity that owns all the property and controls all the municipal functions of an entire town is a state actor that must run the town in compliance with the Constitution.”

The “public function” test has won out of these two views.

Examples of the “very few” functions that have been deemed to be **“traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state”** include:

1. Holding public elections;
2. Governing a town;
3. Serving as an international peacekeeping force;
4. Owning and controlling all the municipal functions of a town, i.e.
   1. Residential buildings,
   2. Streets,
   3. System of sewers,
   4. Sewage disposal plant;
   5. Business block. (*Marsh v. Alabama*).

**Delegation rationale:** The state has delegated its governance role to a private entity, thereby triggering all of the same reasons why we confer a First Amendment right of access to government-owned property (i.e. concerns about monopoly, democracy, necessity, coercion, reliance/expectations)

**The Public Forum Test (DO NOT FOLLOW): Justifications**

1. Precedents:
   1. Broad language in *Marsh*, i.e. “the more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it”;
   2. Justice Marshall’s dissent in *Lloyd Corp*., citing the same broad language in *Marsh* as the holding of the case.
2. Policy Rationales:
   1. The judiciary has a duty to update the common law (see *State v. Shack*); this role should extend to updating its prior precedents interpreting the Constitution.
   2. Although the Supreme Court has read *Marsh* narrowly (see *Lloyd Corp*. and the overturning of *Logan Valley),* the dramatic rise of social media platforms in the decades since *Logan Valley* calls for revisiting these interpretations;
   3. The same factors that counsel in favor of a First Amendment right of access to government town halls call for First Amendment right of access to social media platforms.

### The Public Trust Doctrine

**CASES**: *Matthews v. Bay Head* (NJ 1984); *Juliana v. U.S.* (D. Or. 2016)

PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE: The ownership dominion and sovereignty over land flowed by tidal waters, which extend to the mean high watermark, is vested in the State in trust for the people. The public’s right to use the tidal lands and water encompasses navigation, fishing and recreational uses (boating, bathing, swimming, and other shore activities added later).

* Most jurisdictions include water that are not tidal waters as well (lakes and such)
* "[T]he power of governing is a trust committed by the people to the government, no part of which can be granted away." The public trust doctrine rests on the fundamental principle that "[e]very succeeding legislature possesses the same jurisdiction and power with respect to [the public interest] as its predecessors." (*Stone v. Mississippi*)

Three types of restriction on governmental authority:

* + - 1. Must be available for use by the general public
      2. Property may not be sold
      3. Property must be maintained for particular use

Three common law doctrines besides public trust to grant access rights to beaches by the general public:

* + - 1. **Dedication**: gift of real property from private owner to public at large. Requires an offer by owner and acceptance by public. Must be made by some unequivocal act by the property owner giving clear evidence of an intent to dedicate the land to public use*.*
         1. But a longstanding acquiescence in use of beachfront property may constitute *implied* dedication.
      2. **Prescription**: if public has used property possessed by another for a particular purpose for a long time, the public can acquire such rights permanently through prescriptive easement. (*Zuni Tribe v. Platt).*
         1. 3 reasons why this concept was not used in past – p. 80
      3. **Custom**: longstanding, uninterrupted, peaceable, reasonable, uniform use of beachfront by public for recreational uses confers continuing rights of access.
         1. Different from prescriptive easement b/c of scale; looking at general habit as opposed to individuals or particular groups crossing.
         2. Oregon SC limited to public use of beaches for which actual proof of past public use exists
         3. Hawaii has a system where public use is allowed from water until stable vegetation line

Application of the public trust doctrine to natural resources predates USA:

* Justinian’s Institutes (Constantinople, 533) – “Wild animals, birds, and fish…as soon as they are caught by anyone become at once the property of their captor by the law of nations; for natural reason admits the title of the first occupant to that which previously had no owner.” *Arnold v. Mundy,* NJ: Recognizes this doctrine carrying over.
  + Oysters can be taken by anyone.

HISTORY OF PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE

* 19th century: Public trust lands were important to commerce, and the state wanted to keep the use open out of a concern about monopolies/fairness/equal access.
* “Public trust asset” within the public domain: Lands covered by tidal waters, wet-sand of the beach
* Theories of access working behind the scenes of public trust doctrine:
  + Navigable waters serve **socially useful** purpose of promoting commerce
  + **Custom** and **common law**: we’ve been doing it this way for a while, developed **expectations** that this will continue. (Expectations of access. Connected to doctrines of adverse possession and prescription/prescriptive easement)
  + Doctrine of **public accommodation**: you have been invited in, and thus your rights in some ways will constrain the rights of the property owner
    - Like *Marsh v. Alabama*; *Logan Valley*; *State v. Shack*

**The Public Trust Doctrine: Rationales?**

1. *Commercial necessity.* Waterways used to be the primary means of transport, therefore, assuring equal access was vital to ensure a functioning economy.
2. *Monopoly rationales*. Waterways and water over tidal lands may be a unique resource, i.e. there may be no alternative site for transporting goods, fishing, or beach recreation.
3. *Equality rationales.* In light of their importance and rarity, ensuring equal access may be important for ensuring equality of citizens in a democratic polity.
4. *Settled Expectations/Reliance Interests*. Over time, the public may develop a reliance interest on a right of access to waterways; the law should protect settled expectations and reliance interests.
5. *Environmental rationales*. There are some resources that are so valuable they should not be subject to private monopoly and ownership, but instead, preserved in trust.

**Over time, the public trust doctrine was expanded in geographic scope:**

* Pre-*Avon,* *Illinois Central v. Illinois*, 1892: Land covered by tidal/navigable fresh waters (up to the mean high tide line) belonged to the people for fishing and navigation
* *Avon*: Public trust applied to municipally owned, dry sand beach immediately landward of high-water mark, and extended public’s right to use the tidal lands to recreational uses. Three changes in finding for public rights:
  + Includes the dry sand *AND* foreshore
  + Limitedly applies to **municipally owned** beaches
  + Extended public’s right to use for the purposes of recreation, in addition to fishing and navigation.
* *Matthews*: Dry sand of beaches owned by a non-profit charitable association. What about quasi-public organizations that are not municipalities?
  1. In cases where the public is denied reasonable access to the dry sand area and foreshore, quasi-public organizations must take on the responsibility to provide it.
  2. Ambient air, wild flora, fauna (*Robinson v. Penn. Pa.* 2013, footnote 10 in Juliana, 2016)
* States apply the doctrine differently: Some allow public access rights to be extinguished upon conveyance to private entity, others say the rights are inalienable.

**Different approaches of courts in deciding whether to extend the trust:**

* Does the resource share the same general features/functions as an existing public trust asset? (*Illinois Central,* 1892)
* Is the resource necessary for the enjoyment of an existing public trust asset and, when combined, creates a unique, irreplaceable resource that is in limited supply and yet currently operated by a non-profit charitable association that acts as a public entity but excludes the public? (*Matthews,* NJ 1972)
* Is resource something that has been enjoyed for ages without dispute and furthers general welfare? (*White v. Hughes*, 1939)

**To decide if a court can enforce public trust duties:**

1. Is the property within the public domain and thus subject to public trust? Different approaches by courts:
2. Has the entity violated one of the fiduciary duties of the trust?
3. Is the title owner an entity for which a court can enforce trust duties (to grant public right of access)?
   1. State government (*Illinois Central*)
   2. Municipal government (*Avon*)
   3. A quasi-public entity (*Matthews*)

(Court looks to whether the entity has assumed the shoes of a public organization; see Juliana for most recent iteration of public function test for purposes of state action analysis in First Amendment doctrine)

* 1. Federal government (*Juliana*)

*Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Illinois* (1892): **BEGINNING OF MODERN PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE**

* Importance: Seminal Supreme Court case on the public trust. The state will always have a right to revoke. Expanded public trust from just tidal waters to the land up to the average high water mark.
* Rule: The state owns the land under navigable waters, and can only grant that land to a private party for purposes of enhancing navigation/public use.

***Arnold v. Mundy (NJ 1821):*** Oyster case extending public trust doctrine to wetlands.

* P. 74

***Matthews v. Bay Head* (NJ 1984): EXTENDING PUBLIC TRUST TO NON-MUNICIPALITIES AND DRY SAND**

* Facts: Bay Head Improvement Association (quasi-public entity) owned portions of the beach in Bay Head town. The wet sand, under the public trust doctrine, was open to the public and the dry sand was not. Only Association members were allowed to use these portions of the beach during the day in summer. Association generally allowed only Bay Head residents to become members. Result: Bay Head nonresidents were generally not allowed to use these portions of the beach during summer. Also, b/c there were no *public* beaches in Bay Head, nonresidents were generally prohibited from using the beach anywhere in town unless they knew a private beachfront owner.
* Importance: The public trust doctrine extends to dry beach area above the foreshore owned by a quasi-public entity. (Note: not extended to private property).
  1. Crucial factor is whether domain in question is essential to enjoying what already belongs to public.
* Rule: If there is no reasonably satisfactory access to the dry sand area and foreshore for the public, then a non-municipal organization must provide it and take on some of the functions of a municipality. **This is especially true if the organization already has a quasi-public role and takes on some of the functions of a municipality**

Holding:

1. The public must be given access to and use of privately owned dry sand areas as reasonably necessary. In order for the public trust doctrine to be viable, public must be able to utilize the dry sand area of the beach in addition to the area covered by the ebb and flow of tide (foreshore).
2. Membership in the association must be open to the public at large to enroll in.
3. Ends off with **reasonableness standard**.

Note: Should the public trust doctrine be extended to the Bay Head Association?

* Based on nature of **organization**
  1. It is basically a municipality itself
  2. If the association is non-profit quasi-public serving the general welfare, then courts will scrutinize the reason why you are excluding people from membership.
* Based on the nature of the **resource**
  1. Efficiency: If scarce, who will maintain it?
     1. The ruling mentions how NJ is expected to have a lot more beach goers in the coming years
  2. Fairness: Might be unfair to deprive private owner, since beach could be established on other property
* In practice this does more work doctrinally than actual results on the ground.

The most recent case to try and extend public trust doctrine is *Juliana* case.

***Juliana v. U.S.* (D. Or. 2016):**

* Facts: Juliana and other teenagers brought suit against federal gov, alleging that the gov’s collective environmental policies caused global warming and rising of the seas, thereby violating fundamental due process rights and the public trust doctrine (b/c of gov’s failure to protect the atmosphere, water, seas, seashores, and wildlife).
  1. Claims that D have “violated their obligation to hold certain natural resources in trust for the people and for future generations”
  2. P want a “(1) a declaration their constitutional and public trust rights have been violated and (2) an order enjoining defendants from violating those rights and directing defendants to develop a plan to reduce CO2emissions.”
  3. For purposes of the case, it is assumed that global warming is occurring, is caused by humans, and poses a serious threat to our planet
  4. In dicta it goes through whole set of precedents that air is part of public trust doctrine.
* Importance: Public trust doctrine applies to the federal government, in addition to the states.
* Rule: Individuals have a fundamental constitutional right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life, which the federal government cannot fail to protect under the public trust doctrine.
* Holding: A claim that the federal government has affirmatively and substantially harmed a climate system capable of sustaining human life, in such a way that the system becomes unable to sustain human life, is cognizable.
  1. Territorial sea is public trust asset, atmosphere remains undecided.

Note: The natural resources trust operates according to basic trust principles, which impose upon the trustee a fiduciary duty to **“protect the trust property against damage or destruction.”** The government, as trustee, has a fiduciary duty to protect the trust assets from damage so that current and future trust beneficiaries will be able to enjoy the benefits of the trust.

## Sharing Ownership In Space: Concurrent Tenancies

### Concurrent Tenancies

**CASES**: *Olivas v. Olivas* (N.M. 1989), *Ark Land v. Harper* (W. Va. 2004)

Property law governs relationships between and among people. State law plays a large role in regulating these relationships. Doctrinal labels and categories have enormous real-world consequences.

* Lot of different terminology
* Property law regulates the default laws

CONCURRENT OWNERSHIP: More than one person may have the right to control the same thing at the same time.

* Ex: spouses, apartment building (landlord tenet), business development 🡪 property is rarely owned by an individual
* Consecutive ownership: Can devise property to transfer at some point in the future (division of ownership over time)

TYPES OF COMMON LAW CONCURRENT TENANCIES

1. Tenancy in common: Separate but undivided interests in the whole. 1 unity: Possession. Can transfer and encumber interest, file to terminate and divide, or bring action for petition.
   1. Two main ways tenancy in common is created:
      * True owner writes a will to transfer property to multiple people
      * Conveyance to people with different proportions
   2. **Default** rule
   3. Very fragile form of ownership and can easily be broken
   4. Examples: timeshares, fractional shares in vacation property
   5. Reasons: spreading out costs.
   6. Tenancy in common allows you to transfer your right to another owner
   7. Issue with tenacity in common is that it allows a property to have many fractional owners which would allow ANY owner who wanted to sell it to force partition proceedings (**law of partition**).
2. Joint tenancy: Not descendible. **4 unities: Time, Title, Interest, Possession.** (Some states have done away with this and allow joint tenancy simply by stating it. Can sever single share while others are still joint tenants.)
   1. Creates a **Right of Survivorship** which transfers your right to someone else with ownership as opposed to who you choose 🡪 known as poor mans will.
   2. Consolidates ownership over time. This Right is highly contingent in most states.
      * Prevent property from getting diluted.
   3. **Partition:** If A and B are joint tenant, and A sells her interest to a non-joint tenant, C, the joint tenancy is severed, and B’s right of survivorship is destroyed. B and C will own the property as tenants in common.
   4. If A, B, C have JT and A conveys his interest to D, then D owns 1/3 of interest in property as TIC with B&C which still own the remaining 2/3 of property as JT.
   5. Most states will allow JT to be severed with conveyance to yourself 🡪 therefore not a very stable form of ownership.
3. Tenancy by the entirety (fewer than half of states): Only within marriage, parties are considered one. Neither party may unilaterally defeat right of survivorship of the other. Ends by mutual agreement or divorce. Requires the 4 unities + 5th unity: Marriage at time the property is acquired.
   1. Very secure right of survivorship, and very hard to break (only through divorce and death)
   2. Many jurisdictions don’t have this form anymore

TYPES OF PARTITIONS

* **Partition**: Action to terminate co-tenancy and divide the property or its proceeds.
* **Partition in kind**: Physical division of the property amongst co-owners ordered by court.
* **Partition by sale**: If partition in kind is not feasible/appropriate, forced judicial sale with the cotenants dividing the proceeds in proportion to their ownership shares.
  + *Ark Land Co. v. Harper* (W. Va. 2004): A partition by sale is undesirable b/c if one party opposes the sale, the receipt of cash proceeds is not always fair compensation for the loss of property. Thus, law of ALL jurisdictions reflects a **presumption towards partition in kind**, only resorting to partition by sale where partition in kind is inconvenient.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CONCURRENT TENANCIES** | | | |
|  | **TENANCY IN COMMON** | **JOINT TENANCY** | **TENANCY BY THE ENTIRETY** |
| CREATION | Usually default. | Usually specific. | Only for married couples. |
| RIGHT OF POSSESSION | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| DUTY TO PAY RENT | Not, unless ouster | No, unless ouster | No, unless ouster |
| RIGHT TO PROFITS | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| DUTY TO PAY COSTS | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| RIGHT TO UNILATERAL TRANSFER | Yes | Yes; a joint tenant who sells **severs** the joint tenancy between selling owner and remaining owners. | No |
| RIGHT TO UNILATERALLY ENCUMBER | Yes | Yes; in most states, an encumbrance will not survive the death of the encumbering co-tenant. | In most states, spouses cannot encumber their interest in property held by the entirety without each other’s consent, and creditors cannot attach property held through tenancy by the entity to satisfy debts of one of the spouses. |
| RIGHT OF SURVIVORSHIP | No | Yes; BUT a J**oint tenant who transfers property destroys Right of Survivorship** of fellow owners with respect to transferred share. | Yes |
| RIGHT TO TERMINATE | Yes | Yes | No; only on divorce or death. |

***Olivas v. Olivas* (N.M. 1989): DUTY TO PAY RENT**

* Facts: Sam (P) and Carolina (D) Olivas divorced. Had held their property as TIC, but about two months before the divorce, Sam chose to move out of their house and Carolina remained in possession. Sam brought an action for rent, claiming that he was **constructively ousted** from the house.
  + He must show that he was constructively ousted b/c ordinarily a co-tenant has no obligation to pay rent to another tenant 🡪 this is b/c you have right to occupy so should not get paid for rent unless you were ousted.
* Holding: There is not only evidence that Sam chose to move out and that his move was one of the reasons Carolina filed for divorce, but also that upon moving out, Sam moved in with a girlfriend. Therefore, Sam has not carried his burden in proving that there has been a constructive ouster. Rather, he chose on his own to move out and possibly even created the impetus for divorce. Sam is not entitled to rent.
* Rule: Although a divorced spouse forced to move out of the marital residence MAY be entitled to rent from the remaining spouse under the doctrine of constructive ouster, this will not be the case where the departing spouse chose on his own to move out and thus contributed to the divorce. On the contrary, the remaining spouse will be liable for rent **only if** the realities of the situation, without there being any fault by either co-tenant, prevent the co-tenants from sharing occupancy
  + Ex: the parties cannot be expected to live together reasonably on the property, and they come to a mutual agreement that one of them must move out.

***Ark Land v. Harper* (W. Va. 2004): RIGHT TO JUDICIAL PARTITION**

* Facts: Caudill family-owned property exclusively for 100 years and sold a portion to Ark Land Co 🡪 now TIC. Since Ark wanted to extract the coal from entire property, they wanted to purchase the remainder of the property, but Caudill’s declined. Ark filed suit seeking to partition and sell the property.
  + **Caudill’s** sought a partition in kind and presented expert testimony that the property was capable of being partitioned in kind.
  + **Ark** presented expert’s testimony suggesting that the partition in kind would cause an increase in several million dollars in mining costs.
  + Partition in kind: physically split up the property
  + Partition in sale: sell property and everyone gets cut of the sale
* Holding: Partition in kind ordered. While this court recognizes the resulting economic burden on Ark Land, it does NOT justify the sale of the Caudills’ ancestral family home. Caudill family owned the property for over 100 years; uninterested in land’s monetary value; sought only to maintain family ownership of property.
  + Non-economic interest would be prejudiced if land is partitioned by sale.
  + Economic hardship is NOT the sole factor to consider. Extremely relevant but not decisive factor.
    - Sentimental value should play a role 🡪 *Radin* (cell line case)
    - Court justifies their decision b/c **Ark should have known** that their was a possible economic loss when they invested in the property.
  + Concurrence: Right test, but improperly applied. Partition by sale b/c Caudill’s interest in the property does not outweigh the great economic burden Ark will have to endure.
* Rule: Previously, this court has ordered partition by sale only where: (1) partition in kind is not convenient; (2) the sale will result in the promotion of at least one of the parties’ interests; and (3) the sale will not prejudice the interests of the other parties. The economic value of property is not the decisive factor in determining whether to partition in kind or by sale. Other relevant factors include longstanding family ownership & sentimental/emotional interests.

For exam: be familiar with the main forms and **how you would advise a client.** AND be able to explain **how law of partition has affected property rights**

* Prof. Mitchell and Heir’s Property law 🡪 90% loss by blacks. LOOK UP
* New statutes allow cotenants to buy out other tenants as opposed to go straight to partition which leads to land loss amongst blacks.

### Spouses and Unmarried Partners

HISTORY

Pre-1800s English Common Law: Coverture

* After marriage, wife's identity dissolves and merges with the husband.
* Exception for some control for the wife: trust, antenuptial agreement

Traditional treatment of property interest upon death of a spouse (still available in some states)

* Dower interest for wife: upon death of husband, she has 1/3 life estate in the husband’s land: this interest is inalienable without her consent
* Curtesy interest for husband: life estate in all the lands in which his wife owned a present freehold estate during the marriage and that was inheritable by issue of the couple, but only if the couple had a child

Mid-1800s: Married Women’s Property Acts of 1839

* Abolition of Coverture: restores married woman to the same position as single women under common law 🡪 Betty Allen case
* Woman gains rights over her separate property
* Failed to recognize joint property: women still had no title to the H’s property

Mid-1800s: Separate Property Regimes

1960s: Equitable Divorce – Marital Property

Early 2000s: Same-Sex Marriage

SEPARATE VS. COMMUNAL PROPERTY SYSTEMS

Separate Property (Majority Rule, 41 states)

* **Marriage**: all property is earned and **kept separately**.
* **Divorce**: equitable distribution of property owned by each party on divorce based on a variety of factors (economic need, status, contributions of the respective parties)
* **Death**: Many states provide for a forced share of the decedent’s estate, effectively overriding the will to give the widow(er) 1/3 to ½ of the estate

Community Property (Minority Rule, 9 states)

* **Marriage**: Spouses retain their property held prior to marriage separately but **jointly own property acquired during the marriage**
* **Divorce**: Most community property states adopt the equitable distribution principle but a few give each spouse their separate property and half of the joint property
* **Death**: A spouse may dispose of their separate property and half of the joint property by will; one half of joint property mechanically goes to spouse

Right to Convey: The right of a spouse to unilaterally convey

* Hypo: The secret bank account 🡪 in separate property jurisdiction the son is likely to prevail.
  + Other side could argue that the property was actually joined property OR that there is a legal duty to provide for the spouse.
  + In community property state
* Community property will be liable to creditors in some jurisdictions, but usually only that property that was shared.

*O’Brien v. O’Brien* (NY 1985): **DEFINING “MARITAL PROPERTY”**

* Facts: Mr. (P) and Mrs. (D) O’Brien got married and P enrolled in medical school. To pay for joint living expenses, D put her education on hold, got a job, contributed all of her earnings to joint living expenses, maintained household. After P received his medical license he filed for divorce. Together, their only asset of any value was P’s license. In the divorce proceeding, the trial court awarded D part of the estimated value of the medical license.
* Importance: License acquired during marriage is marital property subject to equitable distribution. OUTLIER: no other state high court has ruled that a license is property.
* Rule: Marital property is subject to equitable distribution. It is property acquired by either spouse during the marriage regardless of the form in which title is held. In making an equitable distribution of marital property, the court considers any direct or indirect contribution to the acquisition of the property.
* Holding: A license acquired during marriage is marital property subject to equitable distribution under NY statute Domestic Relations Law 236(b)(5) bc it is a thing of value (interest in a professional career potential) arising out of marital relationship (direct or indirect contributions of non-title holding spouse). Here, most of the marriage was devoted to P getting his license and D played a major role in that effort. Her contributions represent investments in their partnership and the license is a product of the parties’ joint efforts, so should be considered marital property.

Reasoning:

* **Textual**: NY statute Domestic Relations Law 236(b)(5) directly says that contributions of one spouse to other’s career represents investments in economic partnership.
  + Not clear though if equitable distribution means that the courts should be allowed to invent new forms of property
* **History/purpose** behind statute: Statute was an attempt to replace existing system with equitable distribution of marital property, based on the premise that marriage is an economic partnership to which both parties contribute.
  + In past, have said that pension benefits are shared property (shared)
* **Locke**: Your labor is your property. Working spouses make great sacrifices and forgo the acquisition of marital assets that could have been accumulated if the professional spouse had been employed, rather than occupied with the study and training necessary to acquire a professional license.

Concurrence: A professional in training who is not finally committed to a career choice when the distributive award is made may be locked into a particular kind of practice simply because the monetary obligations imposed by the distributive award made by the court. The equitable distributions of the law were intended to provide flexibility.

## Sharing Ownership Over Time: Present Estates & Future Interests

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **THE ESTATES SYSTEM: FREEHOLD ESTATES** | | | |
| **PRESENT ESTATE** | **WORDS USED TO CREATE** | **FUTURE INTEREST?** | |
| IN GRANTOR | IN GRANTEE |
| Fee simple absolute | “to A” “to A and her heirs” | No future interest | |
| Fee simple determinable | “as long as” “during” “until” “while” | Possibility of reverter (*automatic*) |  |
| Fee simple subject to condition subsequent | “provided that” “on condition” “but if” | Right of entry (also called right reentry or power of termination), *may* be exercised |  |
| Fee simple subject to executory limitation | “until (or unless)…., then to…” “but if…, then to…” |  | Executory interest |
| Life estate | “for life” | Reversion | Remainder (vested or contingent) |

DOCTRINES OF ESTATE SYSTEMS

1. **Presumption Against Forfeiture** (*Edwards v. Bradley*) - reluctance to recognize future interests
2. **Doctrine Against Waste** (*McIntyre*) - seeks to mediate conflicts between the interests of life tenants and interests of future interest holders by preventing present possessory owners from unreasonably damaging the estate
3. **Rule Against Creation of New Estates** (*Johnson*) - Prohibits owners from creating ownership packages that do not fit within one of the established estates. People cannot create new kinds of estates. Courts will re-write wills, ignore the grantor’s intent in order to preserve the status quo.
4. **Rule Against Racial Restrictions** (*Shelley, Evans v. Abney*) - Covenants restraining the ownership, use, or enjoyment of land by racial and ethnic minorities are prohibited. *Evans* suggests that this should be applied only in circumstances where there is clear disparate treatment
5. **Rule Against Restraints on Alienation (*MORE BELOW*)** (*Serio, Woodside*) - Restraints on Marriage: If a condition is designed to support a spouse until he or she remarries, then it is valid. If the condition is not so designed, it is invalid under the rule.

* Absolute restraint? Void. An absolute restraint on alienation is “repugnant” to the nature of a “fee simple” interest in real property. (*Serio*)
* Partial restraint? Reasonableness test. Reasonableness is determined by “weighing the utility of the restraint against the injurious consequences of enforcing the restraint.” (*Woodside*)

1. **Rule Against Perpetuities** - “No interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, no later than 21 years after the death of some life in being at the creation of the interest.”

TERMS

**Future Interest:** The right to take possession in the future under specified circumstances.

1. Future interests exist at the moment they are created, though the holder of a future interest as no right to **possess** the property until the triggering event occurs;
2. Transfer of possession may be certain or contingent on the occurrence of certain events.

**Devisees:** those entitled to real property under a will

**Heirs:** those entitled by law to inherit the property if the owner dies **intestate** (without a will)

1. If no relatives qualify as heirs, the property will **escheat** to the state.

**Trust:** a legal arrangement in which one person or entity holds title to property for the benefit of another.

CONTEMPORARY ESTATES SYSTEM

**Fee simple estate**: present estate, could potentially last forever—there are 4 fee simple estates:

1. *Fee simple absolute*: a fee simple without an associated future interest.

* Language: (1) O to A, (2) O to A and her heirs (3) O to A in fee simple;
* Form of **absolute ownership** – full bundle of rights of property ownership. If A dies intestate (with no will), property goes to heirs (or gov’t if no heirs).
* **One cannot create a condition totally prohibiting/restricting the alienability of a fee simple estate, or requiring a forfeiture upon alienation *(Edwards)*.**

1. *Fee simple determinable*: A type of defeasible fee where the future interest **reverts** **automatically** to the grantor on the happening of a stated event.

* Describes the interest with *words of duration*: O to A “as long as used for”/ “during” used for specific purpose
* The future interest is called a “**possibility of reverter**.”
* If condition violated, ownership *automatically* shifts to O/heirs/devisees. The language need not explicitly state the possibility of reverter.

1. *Fee simple subject to condition subsequent*: A type of defeasible fee in which the grantor may choose to retain for herself or her heirs the right to decide, at the time a specified condition is violated, whether to retake the property.

* Language (uses words of *condition):* “on condition that”; “provided that”; “but if used for [another] purpose…shall have right to terminate”.
* The future interest is called **right of entry**
* Interest does not automatically shift back to grantor; grantor must assert the right
* If grantor fails to assert right of entry after condition is satisfied, **doctrine of** **laches** may prevent the holder of the right of entry from waiting too long to assert her right of entry; laches prevents recovery when an unreasonable delay in asserting legal rights unfairly prejudices another.

1. *Fee simple subject to executory interest*: When the future interest in a defeasible fee belongs to **someone other than the grantor**, the present interest is called a fee simple subject to executory limitation.

* Language: O to A “so long as used for residential purposes, then to B”
* Future interest is called an **executory interest**
* O to A so long as used for residential purposes, then to B (but this violates the rule against perpetuities because B’s executory interest could vest too far into future).

**Life estate**: A conveyance designating a present ownership to a grantee for the duration of his lifetime.

* “To Sarah for life, and then to her heirs”
* Future interest: If FI goes to grantor - *reversion*. If FI goes to 3rd party – *remainder*.

**Term of years**: Any estate limited by specific period of time (not lifetime/event). A lease lasting for more than 1 year is term of years.

* *[Fee tail* – “to A and the heirs of his body” – i.e. son to son to son - most states no longer recognize (was used to keep the estate in the family): either fee simple or life estate with remainder in A’s heirs]

**HIERARCHY OF PREFERENCES IN ESTATES** (if there is language ambiguity re: type of estate. Hierarchy tracks the presumption against forfeitures.)

1. **Fee Simple Absolute**
2. **Covenant** (Must have a benefitted/burdened estate, unless in gross to government, charity, HOA)
3. **Fee Simple Subject to a Condition Subsequent** (If it is ambiguous as to whether a conveyance creates a fee simple determinable or fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, the presumption against forfeitures leads courts to prefer the latter. This is because, unlike with a fee simple determinable, reversion is not automatic.)
4. **Fee Simple Determinable**

**INTERPRETIVE RULES**

1. **\*\*One cannot grant more than one has**—if you have a Life Estate with reversion to grantor, you cannot grant a fee simple absolute
2. **Honor Grantor’s Intent**—Readthe plain language of the deed, considered as a whole, to determine the intent of the parties. The language must “clearly state the grantor’s intent to create a discretionary power to terminate” *(Wood)*
   1. Assume that if draftsmen wanted to create a certain present estate with a future interest, would have used the required terminology (*Edwards*)
   2. Precatory language (below)
3. **Presumption against forfeitures**—If it is possible to interpret the language in a conveyance to avoid loss of the property by the current owner, courts will generally adopt this interpretation
   1. “It is a well-settled rule that conditions tending to destroy estates, such as conditions subsequent, are not favored in law. They are strictly construed.” (*Wood)*

**TREATMENT OF PRECATORY LANGUAGE (**not intended to have any legal significance**)**

1. When conveyances include language explaining the purpose of the transfer, the vast majority of courts will hold the language to be precatory – not intended to have any legal significance – and will interpret the conveyance to have transferred all the interests the grantor owned.
2. Follows from the presumption against forfeitures.

**JUSTIFICATION OF INTERPRETIVE RULES**

1. **Efficiency:** Property should be able to shift to its most valuable, productive, or desired use over time;

* Enforcing the interests of a grantor over a current owner facilitates **dead hand control** of an estate, which operates to the detriment of alienability and economic efficiency
* It also risks **concentrating ownership** in the hands of certain groups to the exclusion of others, perpetuating distributive injustice. The above interpretive rules grant current owners greater freedom to alter land uses as economic and social conditions change
* **Counterargument:** one could argue that future interests may promote alienability and efficiency in some circumstances, as they make grantors more willing to part with their property if they can control who owns it or how it is sued in the future.

1. **Administrability:** Strict formal requirements for the creation of future interests are easier to administer by courts;
2. **Fairness:** Granting ability to create future interests a reward for labor. But is it fair to restrict the right of the current owner, who’s more recent labor has engendered an expectation interest in being able to use the property for whatever purposes the current owner sees as most beneficial?

* While most courts are reluctant to find a future interest in the absence of clear language creating one, *some courts are eager to find a future interest when the property is donated for charitable purposes*.

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON ADVERSE POSSESSION CLAIMS OVER FUTURE INTERESTS

1. The **statute of limitations on a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent** only starts to run from the moment the grantor exercises his or her right to re-entry;
2. The **statute of limitations starts to run on a fee simple determinable** from the moment the condition is violated.

CONTINGENT AND VESTED REMAINDERS

1. **Contingent:** Remainders are contingent if (1) the remainder will take effect only upon the happening of an event that is not certain to happen, or (2) if the remainder will go to a person who cannot be ascertained at the time of the initial conveyance.
   1. Example of a **class gift**: “O to A for life, then to the children of B.” Contingent remainder in the children of B if B has no children upon the conveyance from O to A, because the children cannot be individually identified.
   2. May be destroyed if contingency does not occur
2. **Vested:** Remainders to persons who are identifiable at the time of the initial conveyance and for whom no conditions must occur before the future interest becomes possessory, other than the death of the life estate tenant.
   1. **Absolutely Vested:** O to A for life, then to B
   2. **Vested Remainders Subject to Open:** Remainder that is vested in some individuals but may be divided with others who join the class in the future – e.g. in a class gift when some children are born but others might be born in the future;
   3. **Vested Remainders Subject to Divestment:** A vested remainder that may be lost due to an event that occurs after the original conveyance –e.g. O to A for life, then to B, but if B marries a lawyer, the property shall then revert to O. If B marries lawyer B loses right to obtain property after death of A

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **VESTED REMAINDERS** | | | |
| **Type** | **Conditions** | | |
| **Indefeasibly Vested** | Created in an ascertained or born person | AND not subject to a condition precedent other than the natural termination of the preceding possessory estate | AND no possibility of dilution, i.e. no opening up to other recipients |
| **Vested Subject to Open** | AND the remainder belongs to a class of recipients that could potentially expand in the future |
| **Vested Subject to Divestment** | AND the remainder could be completely prevented from becoming possessory |

*Edwards v. Bradley* (Va. 1984): **PRESUMPTION AGAINST FORFEITURE; FEE SIMPLE V. LIFE ESTATE**

* Facts: Grantor places three conditions on conveyance to spendthrift daughter: 1) can’t encumber, 2) can’t convey (restraint on alienation), 3) can’t burden with debt. If conditions violated, remainder to grantee’s children. Grantee dies, but wants to devise estate to all but one of her children. Child left out sues to enforce the life estate with remainder to children. Other child claims it was fee simple subject to conditional limitation which, because the condition was not violated, could be devised as grantee chose.
* Holding: **In the absence of language clearly creating a specific type of ownership, a will placing forfeiture restraints on an interest in land creates a life estate, not a fee simple.** Such restraints on alienation are void in a fee simple estate, so when they are placed on property in a will, a life estate is created in order to preserve the conditions. This will promote the grantor’s intent to effectuate an enforceable restraint on alienation.
  + Lilliston will created a life estate in Jones.
  + Thus, Jones, upon her death, had no interest in the farm and her divestiture to only five of her six children was invalid. The farm passed automatically to all of her children equally, including Bradley.
* Rule: \*\***Forfeiture restraints are valid as to life estates, but not to fee simple estates.**
  + \*\*You cannot create a condition prohibiting the alienation of a vested fee simple estate. So it must be a life estate, which may include conditional limitations.

***Wood v. Board of County Commissioners of Fremont County (Wyo. 1988):*** Presumption against forfeitures

* FACTS**:** in 1948 Woods deeded to Fremont County land “for the purpose of constructing and maintaining thereon a County Hospital in memorial to the gallant men of the Armed Forces of the United States…” Fremont County constructed a hospital and operated it until 1983. Then sold to a private buyer, moved the hospital to a different location, and in 1984 put the premises up for sale. Woods **sued for recognition** that the deed created either a fee simple determinable or fee simple subject to a condition subsequent with a right of reversion in them if the land ceased to be used as a hospital. Trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of Fremont County
* **ISSUE**—Did the deed create a fee simple determinable or fee simple subject to a condition subsequent in such a way that the Woods retained a right of reversion?
* **HOLDING**— Language does not clearly state the estate conveyed will expire automatically if the land is not used for the stated purpose – no evidence of intent to convey FSD.
  + Plain language of the deed does not clearly state intent of the grantors to retain a discretionary power to reenter the land if the land ceased to be used for the stated purpose, so no FSSCS.

**RULE**—The **presumption against forfeitures** governs here over **intent** (two possible constructions)—even though intent was probably not for a fee simple, you CANNOT say so for sure unless it is **expressly clear**.

* **JUSTIFICATION:**

1. To be a fee simple determinable, you need language like “so long as,” “until,” or “during,” and the deed does not include those;
   1. Otherwise, the court will infer an intent not to convey this type of fee simple, which it does so in this case.
2. To be a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, you need language like “upon express condition that,” “upon condition that,” or “provided that,” and the deed does not include those;
   1. Otherwise, the court will infer an intent not to convey this type of fee simple, which it does so in this case.
3. **Why a Rule against Forfeitures is better:**
   1. **Administrable**—clear rule;
   2. **Efficient**—creates incentives for people to be clear about intent;
   3. **Policy**—don’t want a dead hand control of aristocracy being able to pass down property;
   4. **Distributive justice**—encourages distribution against monopolies and for new uses and new owners

Hypotheticals:

* Blanche Spurlock Case (p.761)
* Cathedral conveyance (p. 761)

### Restrictions on Estates & Charitable Trusts

**CY PRES**—Thedoctrine of cy pres, or ***equitable reformation***, permits a court to modify a grant to validate it on the presumption that this is **consistent with the intent of the grantor.**

1. **Burden** on the party seeking reformation to prove that the donor had a **general charitable intent.**
2. Modern trend is to **presume** general charitable intent.
3. Many courts (contrary to *Evans*) reform trusts that illegally restricted benefits on the basis of race or sex.

**\*\*RESTRAINTS ON ALIENATION\*\***

1. There is a strong ***presumption that property owners should be able to transfer their interests***. Promoting alienability may allow property to shift easily to a more valued use, enhance freedom and flexibility for current owners, encourage dispersal of property to new owners, and prevent discriminatory exclusion
2. **Rules constraining restrictions/future interests to promote alienability**: (1) rule against creation of new estates (2) rule against unreasonable restraints on marriage (3) rule against unreasonable restraints on alienation (4) rule against perpetuities (5) prohibition on unreasonable racial restrictions (below).
3. **Test for reasonableness:** To determine reasonableness, court must **“weigh…utility of the restraint against the injurious consequences of enforcing the restraint.”** *(Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes)).*
   1. Impact on Fair Market Value?
   2. Number of Buyers Excluded?
   3. What proportion of a class of people are affected? Does it affect one particular class disproportionately?
   4. Because alienability is a core property right necessary to ensure efficient allocation of property interests to their most valuable use, the greater the restraint, the stronger the justification that must be made to support it.
4. Absolute restraints are almost always struck down. (*Serio*)
   1. Private controls on land use may make property less alienable by eliminating buyers who do not want the land with the restrictions. Such restrictions may be challenged as **indirect restraints on alienation** (hard to win).
5. **RULE**: Covenants that require owners to obtain consent of the grantor/developer to sell, lease, or otherwise convey their property are usually struck down by courts as unreasonable restraints on alienation (*Serio*).
   1. However, covenants that grant such powers to HOAs/condominium associations are presumed to be valid, unless it can be shown the restrictions are “arbitrary, against public policy, or in violation of some fundamental constitutional right” (*Woodside*).
6. **Charities:** Restraints on alienation are generally allowed when the holder of the property interest is a charity.
7. **Low income Housing:** Restraints on alienation that prohibit leasing of low- income housing property or sale to family that is not low-income have been held to be *reasonable* restraints on alienation because “the provision of housing for low and moderate income persons is in keeping with the public policy of this state.” (*City of Oceanside*).

***Evans v. Abney* (1970): CY PRES AND CHARITABLE TRUSTS; RULE AGAINST RACIAL RESTRICTIONS**

* Facts: Senator Bacon willed a park to the city of Macon, GA with the restriction that the park was for whites only. However, Bacon’s intentions could not be fulfilled b/c of *Evans v. Newton* (U.S. 1966), which held that the continued operation of the park must be without racial discrimination –public character of the park dictates that it should be viewed as a public institution subject to command of 14th A.
  + On remand, petitioners argued that the trust should be saved by applying the *cy pres* doctrine to amend the terms of the will and strike the racial restrictions
  + The trial court refused to apply *cy pres*, stating that the “sole purpose” of the trust was to make the park open only for white people, which was in irreconcilable conflict with the holding of *Evans v. Newton*;
  + *Evans*: three different interpretations – (1) state action when passed law allowing for segregated parks, (2) public reliance,
* Rule: The interpretation of trusts and wills, and application of the cy pres doctrine, is governed by state law.
* Holding: Since Bacon’s sole intent was for the park to be for white people, there is NO way that the language of the will can be changed while still effectuating its purpose. The **trust is voided** and the land will revert to Bacon’s heirs.
  + Saying that the person who is responsible for injecting the discrimination was a private individual. The only person acting with racial discrimination is the senator, NOT the state.
  + Exercising Cy Pres doctrine is a neutral law with no racial animus.
* Dissent, Brennan: Shelley holds that when parties of different races want to deal with one another, a state court CANNOT prevent it by enforcing a private scheme of racial discrimination. As far as the record shows, this is a case of a state court enforcing a racial restriction to prevent willing parties from dealing with one another, and thus denying equal protection.

***Johnson v. Whiton* (Mass. 1893):** **RULE AGAINST CREATION OF NEW ESTATES**

* Facts: Royal Whiton willed 1/3 of his estate to his granddaughter Sarah Whiton “and her heirs on her father’s side,” and the rest to his other grandchildren.
  + Whiton tried to convey the land willed to her but it was refused because she could not convey a fee simple absolute under the interest willed to her.
* Holding: A conveyor of land may NOT create new types of inheritance. When a conveyance attempts to do this, the **court will construe the conveyance as in the most similar established type of estate.** In Royal Whiton’s will, he devised one third of his estate to Sarah Whiton and her heirs on her father’s side. This is an unrecognized kind of inheritance. The words “on her father’s side” are rejected, leaving Sarah Whiton with a fee simple estate that she is entitled to convey.
  + Court rewrites the will; fee simple absolute.
* Rule: If a land conveyance that does NOT directly qualify as one of the existing types of inheritance it will be interpreted to create the most similar estate.

Notes: Words of limit (“for life”) vs. words of purchase (“to A”)

Some scholars have said this should be to case representing property law 🡪 that the court will only respect and enforce property rights which are already recognized

Case represents the (unspoken) doctrine and goals of **Numerous Clausus**

* The doctrine of numerus clausus is a general rule against the creation of new estates. A conveyance that does not fit within any of the established categories must be interpreted to fit an established estate.
* This means that grantors MUST put their conveyances in a recognizable form if they want courts to recognize the package of rights they intend to create.
* It also means that certain packages of rights will NOT be recognized.

### Leasehold Estates

**CASES**: *Vasquez v. Glassboro* (N.J. 1980), *Sommer v. Kridel* (N.J. 1977)

Landlord agrees to transfer possession of the property for a specified period to the tenant. In return for the tenant’s promise to make a periodic rental payment.

1. Possession reverts to landlord at the end of the tenancy
2. A lease is both a **conveyance** of a property interest as well as a **contract** between landlord and tenant

**FOUR TYPES OF TENANCIES**

1. **Term of Years:** Lasts for specified period of time determined by the parties. May terminate prior to the end of the fixed period upon happening of some event or condition.
   1. Landlord’s future interest is a **reversion**, but lease may also grant a **remainder** to third party.
   2. Landlord may NOT evict prior to end of term unless tenant is breaching material term, such as the covenant to pay rent.
   3. Death of either party does NOT terminate leasehold
2. **Periodic Tenancy:** Renew automatically at specified periods unless either landlord or tenant chooses to end the relationship.
   1. Notice is required prior to termination
   2. **Month-to-month** tenancies are a form of periodic tenancy. Uniform Residential Landlord Tenant Act (ULTRA) requires 60-day notice.
   3. Death of either party does NOT terminate.
3. **Tenancy at will:** Similar to periodic tenancy except it can be ended with NO notice to either party..
   1. Most jurisdictions now require notice by statute
   2. Still be distinguishable from periodic tenancy in some instances where death of either landlord or tenant may terminate tenancy at will.
4. **Tenancy at sufferance (holdover tenant):** Where a tenant who was rightfully in possession of a leasehold interest but wrongfully stays after the leasehold terminates.
   1. Intended to distinguish between tenant who wrongfully overstays and a trespasser. Different legal procedure for ejecting – eviction proceeding followed by court judgment is required.
   2. Some states say if landlord continues to accept rent from holdover tenant, implies new lease term has begun.
5. Same rules generally apply to commercial or residential leases, but courts more inclined to adopt common law rules regulating residential leases on the assumption that they have less bargaining power or expertise to shape contractual arrangements in their best interests than commercial tenants.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **LEASEHOLD ESTATES** | | | | |
|  | **Term Of Years** | **Periodic Tenancy** | **Tenancy At Will** | **Tenancy At Sufferance / Holdover Tenant** |
| **Example** | “X year from the date of this lease” | “To T from month to month” | “To T, with no duration set” | If landlord accepts rent, she may be held to have agreed to a new tenancy (generally month-to-month) |
| **Length / Duration** | Specific length set by the parties; ends automatically after the end date | No end date, renews automatically at specified periods  (i.e. month-to-month). Requires notice to terminate | Until termination/eviction. No notice required. Death terminates. | N/A |
| **Termination at death** | No | No | Yes | N/A |
| **Eviction**  (landlord not allowed to resort to self-help under the modern rule, must go through the **court** + **notice**) | No, unless tenant breaches a material term of the lease (but notice required.)  No unilateral termination. | Yes, but must notice required (usually the length of one period). | Traditional - yes, and no notice required.  Modern (statutes) - yes, but notice required.  \* effectively abolished in many states. | Eviction proceeding followed by court judgement is needed; can’t do it independently. |

**CONFLICTS ABOUT RENT**

There are several things a tenant/landlord can do in these situations:

1. **Stop Paying:** If tenant stops paying rent and stays on premises, owner may sue for back-rent and possession (eviction).
   1. Tenant may assert affirmative defenses
2. **Holdover Tenant Keeps Paying:** If holdover tenant continues to pay, landlord may choose to accept new tenancy.
   1. Most states say it is periodic tenancy.
   2. Minority say new term created if original tenancy was term of years. Landlord may sue for possession, but may have to stop accepting proffered checks to avoid creation of new tenancy. May also have to give notice as if a month-to-month tenancy if checks accepted.
3. In most states landlords barred from using self-help to evict – e.g. change locks (*Berg v. Wiley*).
   1. Old rule said self-help OK if peaceable rather than forcible.
4. **Summary Proceedings/Forcible Entry and Detainer/Unlawful Detainer/Summary Ejectment**: Statutes limit the issues that can be addressed in lawsuit.
   1. **Traditional:** 2 claims (Rent passed due; tenant in possession post lease term expiry) and 2 defenses (Rent was paid; term hasn’t expired).
   2. **Today:**More defenses permitted, including implied warranty of habitability, retaliatory eviction, etc.
   3. Policy concern: landlords more often represented by counsel than tenants; impacts outcomes

**DUTY TO MITIGATE**

The Landlord has 3 options if the tenant stops paying and moves out before the end of the term:

1. **Accept tenant’s surrender:** Tenant’s departure an implied offer to end the term of years. Landlord can accept, and still sue for expectation damages (back rent owed but not paid for the time prior to tenant’s abandonment), but NOT for future rent.
   1. Agreed price – (fair market price + cost of search), if >0.
2. **Re-let on Tenant’s Account:** Refuse to accept surrender by giving notice. Look for new tenant and re-let. When new tenant is found, landlord may sue for damages = new rent – old rent. New rent must be reasonable.
   1. Implications of accepting surrender or not: Assume 1-year tenant moves out after 6 months, and new tenant is month-to-month and moves out after 4 months.
3. **Wait and Sue for rent at end of term vs. mitigate damages:** Almost all states reject this option. Have held landlords have duty to mitigate damages.
   1. Leaseholds increasingly considered under contract law rather than property law, which considered them conveyances of a property interest.
   2. ULTRA stipulates that if landlord fails to undertake reasonable efforts to mitigate, rental agreement is deemed to be terminated.
   3. If reasonable effort undertaken, and fail to let, get market rent-(contract rent+cost).
   4. If new rent is lower than contract rent, landlord may seek to recover damages from original tenant only if the landlord did not accept original tenant’s surrender.

**Arguments for and against duty to mitigate:**

1. For: More efficient for landlords to rent premises than leave them vacant.
   1. Ability to still get expectation damages if new rent low leaves landlord in same position otherwise would have been, and the tenant is better off as well.
   2. Unfair (and inefficient as it causes loss in social wealth) to require tenants to remain locked-in to an apartment and forgo moving elsewhere.
2. Against: Landlord bargained for the right not to have to look for another tenant.
   1. If tenant is unwilling to compensate landlord for right to terminate lease early, however, cost to landlord MUST outweigh the benefit to the tenant.

**Burden of proof**: majority rule like *Sommer* (landlord’s burden to show reasonable efforts), at least for residential leases. Commercial leases different. Minority of states place burden on tenant or have burden shifting framework.

**Tenants are entitled to basic rights:**

1. Legal process prior to eviction
2. Continued occupancy
3. Habitable conditions

**Leases (tenants) v. Licenses (p. 824-5)**

1. Main test is whether owner has transferred exclusive “possession” of a defined space 🡪 if **yes**, then **lease**. If **no**, then probably not then likely a **license**.
   1. URLTA 1.202 exempts students living in dorms or apartment managed by school from protection (they are considered licenses)
   2. *\*\*Vasquez* shows that even if NOT a tenant, the students may have other legal protections
2. Matters if leases v. license for whether landlord can use self-help or not (*Vasquez*)
3. **Licenses**
   1. Limited rights to enter or use land that do not with the land and are usually **revocable at will** by the grantor.
   2. No writing is required—many licenses are implied by the circumstances (i.e. inviting a friend into your home);
   3. Non-transferrable, cannot be inherited, no property interests protected by the U.S. Constitution or Statute of Frauds
4. **Leases**
   1. Possessory rights to use a defined space for all uses not explicitly/implicitly prohibited in the lease
   2. As opposed to Easements—non-possessory, for a limited purpose, not necessarily in a defined space

***Vasquez v. Glassboro* (N.J. 1980):** **DISTINGUISHING TENANCIES FROM OTHER RELATIONSHIPS**

* Facts: Farmers contracted with Glassboro (nonprofit) for services of migrant farm laborers from Puerto Rico. Operated a labor camp in NJ with barracks, common facilities, no real privacy. Contracts did NOT require the workers to pay to live in the camps and provided that if a worker was fired, Glassboro would NOT provide for their transportation back to Puerto Rico. Vasquez was fired. Though there was still an open bed, Glassboro did not allow Vasquez to remain overnight.
  + Farmworkers Rights Project filed a complaint on Vasquez’s behalf, seeking an order permitting Vasquez to reenter the barracks and an injunction prohibiting Glassboro from denying Vasquez use of the barracks except through judicial process.
  + \*\*Court considered recurring question of whether migrant farmworkers should be evicted through a judicial proceeding rather than through a landlord's **exercise of self-help.**
  + At **common law**, one who occupied premises as an employee of the owner and received the use of the premises as part of compensation they are NOT considered a tenant. And therefore, an employer could use self-help.
  + **NJ Anti-eviction Act**: is an employee carve-out which allows eviction in employer/employee relations.
* Holding: Migrant workers staying at Glassboro's barracks are NOT tenants of Glassboro: have no privacy, their occupancy is sporadic, no contract requiring rent. As a result, they are NOT afforded statutory protection against self-help evictions b/c traditionally, only tenants have been entitled to a guaranteed summary action. However, the employment contract between Glassboro and Vasquez was unconscionable, as it did not provide Vasquez with any time to find alternative housing.
  + On **public-policy grounds**, a resolution not involving the contract is necessary.
  + Uses logic of *State v. Shack* that common law is changing with the changing times.
* Rule: A farm-labor service MUST use judicial proceedings to evict a farmworker who remains in possession of his living quarters after the termination of his employment. A landlord may NOT use self-help to evict someone who is legally in possession of his property, even if they are not a tenant protected with guaranteed summary action.
  + Judicial summary process provides an equitable, quick resolution to the dispute that is suitable to both parties.

***Sommer v. Kridel* (NJ 1977): DUTY TO MITIGATE UNPAID RENT**

* Facts: Kridel entered into a two-year lease with Sommer from May 1, 1972 – April 30, 1974. About two weeks after the lease began, Kridel wrote to Sommer stating that his position had substantially changed, that he can no longer continue the lease, and that Sommer can keep the two months’ rent already paid – Sommer never replied. A third party approached Sommer about renting the apartment but Sommer told her that it was occupied, even though he knew it wasn’t. Eventually, in 1973 Sommer re-let the apartment but sued Kridel first. The trial court ruled in favor of Kridel, even though the prevailing rule at the time stated that there was NOT a duty on the part of Sommer to mitigate damages.
* Holding: A landlord has a duty to mitigate damages by making a reasonable effort to re-let the premises when seeking to recover rent from a defaulting tenant.
  + Such a duty is consistent with basic justice and fairness.
  + Trend to treat leases not as conveyances of land, but as contracts. As a result, application of the contract doctrine of mitigation of damages is appropriate. If a landlord fails to mitigate damages when he has the opportunity, the defaulting tenant may be relieved of his duty to pay rent.
  + In this case, a third party was ready, willing, and able to rent Kridel’s apartment and asked specifically about it. This actually made Sommer’s duty to mitigate damages very easy as it would have taken little to no effort to re-let the apartment.
* Rule: A landlord has a duty to mitigate damages when he seeks to recover rents due from a defaulting tenant

### Regulating Living Standards: Warranty of Habitability & Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment

**CASES:** *Javins v. First National Realty Corp* (D.C. 1970), *3000 B.C. v. Bowman* (Penn. 2008)

We are using today and yesterday’s classes to study how we can update common law rules (the details of tenant law is NOT as vital). \*\*STUDY HOW TO MAKE LEGAL ARGUMENTS – INTRO OF BOOK.

**THEME**: Evolution of property law from agrarian roots to modern times has led to incorporation of elements of contract law.

**Moral Hazard Problem**: Tenant has no long-term interest in property, no incentive to care for it. Conversely, landlord has no incentive to make property better today.

**REMEDY #1: IMPLIED COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**--Landlord impliedly promises not to disturb the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the property.

1. Old rule was that tenant’s obligation to pay rent ceased when landlord barred tenant from premises. Rule expanded (new rule) says that if landlord does *anything* to induce tenant to move out, obligation to pay rent ceases – becomes constructive eviction.
   1. \*You need to move out and then sue which isn’t really possible when asking people to leave their homes

**REMEDY #2: CONSTRUCTIVE EVICTION—**Where tenants are deprived of “**substantial interference with quiet enjoyment of the premises**”, may claim they were constructively evicted (*East Haven*).

1. **Actual eviction** – landlord breaches the lease by physically barring tenant from the property – e.g. putting new locks on doors.
   1. Tenant may sue landlord for damages for trespass and may seek injunction ordering landlord to re-convey possession.
2. **Constructive eviction** may be asserted as affirmative defense, or provide a cause of action against landlords.
   1. Traditional rule is that tenant can raise defense of constructive eviction ONLY IF he moves out within a reasonable period of time. Must claim interference with **quiet enjoyment** if interference is sufficiently substantial.
   2. Today, tenants only need to show the premises (or portion thereof) is uninhabitable in that “nobody in his right mind would stay.”
   3. If stop paying and don’t move out? Staying may be evidence that interference is not sufficiently serious to allow tenant to stop paying rent without moving out.
      1. Landlord may be liable for **damages** to tenant under constructive eviction doctrine
         1. Rent abatement, proportional to portion of property no longer usable (*Minjack*)
         2. Punitive damages if wanton disregard for health and safety of tenants (*Minjack*)
         3. \*“all losses which [tenant] can prove he has actually sustained, or which he will necessarily sustain, under the circumstances, as a result of the unlawful eviction.” (*3000 B.C*.)
3. If only portion of property effected, **partial constructive eviction** allows tenant to stay on part of premises from which the tenant does not claim to have been constructively evicted.
   1. Requiring tenants to move out is unfair b/c there is “major shortage’ in residential housing which drastically undermines the bargaining power of tenants in relation to landlords.

**REMEDY #3: IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY—**Obligates landlords to provide premises that are safe and suitable for habitation. Breach of the warranty entitles tenants to move out before the end of the lease term, or to stay and either stop paying rent or pay a reduced rent until the improper conditions of the premises are fixed.

1. **Old rule** was NO implied representations that apartment was habitable, and no duty to repair.
   1. Only duty was to fix latent defects known to them and not easily discoverable. (Caveat Lessee)
2. Litigation about constructive eviction now tends to focus less on physical condition of premises and more on acts of landlord.
3. Leases may include clauses giving landlord right to evict tenants distributing quiet use and enjoyment of other tenants.
4. **New rule:** Gives rise to implied duties on landlords:
   1. If furnished apartment, covenant requires premises to be habitable
   2. Duty to disclose latent defects (not discoverable in a reasonable inspection)
   3. Duty to repair/maintain common areas
   4. If landlord assumes obligation to repair, must repair non-negligently
   5. Duty not to fraudulently misstate state of premises
   6. (Maybe) an obligation to abate nuisances
5. **8 Remedies if breach the warranty:**
   1. **Rescission** or right to move out before end of term: Tenant may repudiate contract if landlord is in breach of covenant, even when change in conditions would NOT amount to constructive eviction.
      1. If tenant moves out early, and landlord sues, tenant can assert LL violated implied warranty of habitability as **affirmative defense**.
   2. **Rent withholding**: Right to stop paying rent if LL is in breach. Breach may be raised as defense in eviction proceeding or claim for back rent.
      1. Distinguishes implied warranty of habitability from constructive eviction – **latter ordinarily requires tenant to move out to become entitled to stop paying rent.**
      2. **Consult statute:** some states require tenant to give notice of defect prior to rent withholding. Some require complaint to be verified by inspector. Some require rent to be paid into escrow.
      3. Always a good idea to pay into escrow if withholding, in case you lose.
   3. **Rent abatement**: If breach, right to reduce rent.
      1. May elect not to withhold but sue for declaratory judgment and ask landlord to reimburse for all or portion of rent paid during period of breach.
      2. More common to withhold and wait to be sued. If defect serious, will get to keep all unpaid rent. If less serious, may have to pay portion.
      3. Amount to be withheld usually based on FMV test – FMV without defect – FMV with. Check statutes.
   4. **Repair and deduct**: Tenant may repair and deduct cost of repair from rent. Some statutes limit by how much.
   5. **Injunctive relief/specific performance**: Some states allow tenant to sue for injunction to get landlord to comply with code.
   6. **Administrative Remedies**: In some states, may call upon inspector to inspect premises, assess repairs to be made, and order landlord to pay.
      1. Inspectors may initiate suits for civil damages.
   7. **Criminal Penalties**: Some landlords face criminal liability of fail to fix dangerous and unlawful conditions.
      1. Judges have ordered landlords to live in buildings as punishment
   8. **Compensatory Damages**: Most jurisdictions limit recovery to rent aid, but some allow for damages > rent (cost of staying in hotel, loss of property etc.)
6. Breach for events beyond control of LL?
   1. *Park West Management Corp v. Mitchell* (1979): when owner’s staff went on strike and garbage piled up, tenants withheld rent and won in suit for back-rent claiming breach of warranty. Owner found responsible for conditions.
   2. Traditional rule was that landlord was NOT responsible for **acts of other tenants** unless lease specifically included an obligation to control other tenants.
      1. Today, landlord may be liable not only for actions he takes, but also for the acts of third parties “performed on property in which the landlord has an interest, which conduct could be legally controlled by him.” (See Restatement (Second) of Property).
   3. **Not waivable, in most jurisdictions, in residential leases** – paternalistic, but warranted because otherwise tenants would always waive (no real choice given bargaining position.)
      1. **Similar reasons given for why other property rights non-waivable:**
         1. ***State v. Shack*** – migrant workers would always waive access to essential services given weak bargaining position.
         2. If one party waives, precedent would be set for the rest of the market to follow – imposes externalities on neighbors
         3. **Radin:** Habitable dwelling an inalienable right – right to livable dwelling tied up in notion of personhood. Wouldn’t waive it if on equal footing with LL.
   4. Incorporated by statute in most jurisdictions post ***Javins.***
   5. **Most jurisdictions do not hold *commercial* leases contain implied warranties.** Jurisdictions that hold implied warranties do exist in commercial leases also make them **disclaimable**.
   6. **Impact:** Formal limits restrict application of doctrine – requirements to show rent withheld for repairs, practice of landlords obtaining protective orders requiring tenants to deposit rent as condition of raising warranty defense, etc.

***Javins v. First Nat’l Realty* (D.C. 1970): RIGHT TO A HABITABLE PREMISE**

* In Javin the judge upended 500 years of property law.
* Facts: Two ppl rented apartments in the same building from First National Realty. They each withheld rent from FNR due to numerous violations of the housing code, which not arise until after leases began. FNR sought ejectment b/c of failure to pay rent.
* Holding: A warranty of habitability (measured by the standards set out in the Housing Regulations for DC) is implied in residential leases and it requires landlords to maintain residential premises in livable condition. If the landlord does not maintain the premises, the tenant is deprived of all value for which he contracted, and breach of this warranty gives rise to the usual remedies for breach of contract.
  + A landlord’s requirement to maintain the premises in livable condition is consistent with contract principles that are increasingly being applied to leases.
  + Although courts have historically not held landlords liable for repairs, the nature of leases has changed and those **precedents are outdated**.
* Rule: An implied warranty of habitability is read into residential leases and breach of that warranty frees tenants from the obligation to pay rent.

Note:

* J. Wright, 1984: “I was indeed influenced by the fact…most of the tenants in Washington, D.C. slums were poor and black and most of the landlords were rich and white. I didn’t like what I saw, and I did what I could to ameliorate, if not eliminate, the injustice involved in the way many of the poor were required to live in the nation’s capital. I offer no apology for not following more closely the legal precedents which had cooperated in creating the conditions that I found unjust.”
* Case from 1863 involving an apartment which was burnt by fire and the courts rules that person did NOT need to pay rent.
* J. Wright key takeaway: created an implied warranty of habitability in landlord tenant relationships.
  + The implied warranty is read into the agreement, saying that housing code is read into every contract between landlord and tenant. And the tenant does NOT need to pay rent if violated.
  + Not every state uses housing code as basis.
* What drives this case is the modern urban dweller. This shift from feudal to modern time should be the background in judging relationship.
* The main units of law which is driving the case: human rights/indignities, and that poor housing hurts society at large. **This is important for property law in the modern age which focuses on society being harmed and not just individuals.**
* J. Wright wrote in private letter that his decision was impacted by fact that black people around the country at the time did not own property.

Based on the notes, this case, while good in theory, has had trouble in practice and not as much impact as would have been thought (**p. 885**). This is b/c:

* You need a lawyer to bring case
* Tenants are required to put money away when not paying rent (escrow)

***3000 B.C. v. Bowman* (Pa. 2008): COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**

* Facts: 3000 B.C. operated a spa and required a peaceful and quiet environment for its successful operation. Rented spa space from Bowman Properties for 12 years, after which Bowman began renting the apt above to a barber shop. Construction and resulting noise from the barber shop harmed spa’s business, which suffered financial loss and eventually moved to another location mid-lease.
  + Sued for breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.
* Holding: This is a **constructive eviction**. Bowman breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in its lease with 3000 B.C. It knew that the utility of the leased space was based on quiet tranquility. Its lease of the apt above substantially and fundamentally impaired the utility of the premises and constituted a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.
  + In seeking to put 3000 B.C. in the position it would have been in absent breach, court awarded damages for period beginning when construction started and ending at the termination of the lease: lost profits, moving expenses, spa credits paid out to customers for ruined sessions, and loss of business goodwill.
  + Court declined to award damages for speculative repeated renewals of the lease.
* Rule: A **covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every lease.**
  + A landlord violates tenant’s implied right of quiet enjoyment of premises if landlord’s conduct substantially and fundamentally impairs the utility of the premises for the tenant, amounting to a constructive eviction, for which damages may be awarded.
  + In awarding damages, the court treats this like a contract action: seeks to put the non-breaching party in the financial position it would have been in had the contract been fulfilled and not breached (can include lost profits of a business, attorney’s fees, additional rent, reputation cost).

**Quick Summary of Unit 3:**

* Property ownership is shared and is usually co-owned (either through time or at the same time).
* Central theme of right to share is about placing interest into ‘packages’ of ownership 🡪 These interests are able to change by generalizing up from property law into common law and then back down to contract law.
  + Shift to contracts is VERY relevant in landlord tenant relationship 🡪 progression
* People who are wealthy can hire lawyers to draft up will to ensure the property will stay on in the family 🡪 the people who has access to legal resources are also the ones who own the property.

# UNIT 4: The Right or Privilege to Use

When someone buys land they might be subject to nuisance, servitudes (easement and covenants) and zoning.

* Easement (refer right on non-owner to use property) and covenants (restrictions on what owner can do with property)
* Restatement has tried to do away with real covenants, equitable servitudes, and negative easements

## Regulating the Right to Use through Nuisance Law

### Law of Nuisance

**CASES**: *Dobbs v. Wiggins* (Ill., 2010), *Johnson v. Paynesville Farmers* (Minn. 2012)

In 1992, WeAct sued NYC for putting in sewage treatment plant. Possible causes of actions:

Nuisance, trespass, public trust doctrine, zoning, cy pres, and equal protection.

The three major laws relating to the right to use are:

1. LAW OF NUISANCE
   1. Nuisance: Substantial and unreasonable interference with the use or enjoyment of land.
   2. Protects the right to quiet enjoyment of the land.
   3. LAW OF TRESPASS
      1. Protects the right of exclusive possession.
      2. Requires NO showing of harm b/c protects right of exclusive possession.
2. LAW OF SERVITUDES
3. LAW OF ZONING

**Distinguish Nuisance from Trespass Claims:**

* *Paynesville*: “The law of nuisance deals with indirect or intangible interference with an owner’s use and enjoyment of land, while trespass deals with direct and tangible interferences with the right to exclusive possession of land”
* Nuisance is about harm, and trespass is the right to exclude
* INTANGIBLE TRESPASS PROBLEM: “The expansion of the tort of trespass to include invasions by intangible matter potentially subjects countless persons and entities to automatic liability absent any demonstrated injury.” (*Paynseville*)
  + SOLUTION: Add a harm requirement (Washington & Alabama).
  + ALTERNATIVE: Refuse to recognize intangible trespass. Preserve distinction between laws of trespass/nuisance.
  + Washington + Alabama has a foreseeability + harm requirement with trespass of particulate particles
  + Paynesville – trespass at its core is protecting a right to exclude and adding a harm requirement would be diluting the bundle of rights.
    - Preserved distinction between law of trespass and nuisanc

WHEN TO BRING A NUISANCE CLAIM:

1. Ex ante: Not too early under the **doctrine of anticipatory nuisance**, which bars a nuisance claim before the use is in place.
   1. Could enter world of contracts (servitudes - contracts that run with the land forever and bind future people there; zoning ordinances - pass law)
   2. You have to prove two things:
      1. “Near certainty” that the nuisance would take place
      2. That once nuisance-causing activity begins, cost of dismantling may weigh against finding a nuisance
2. Ex post: Not too late. You must sue before the **statute of limitations** runs out.
   1. Many courts distinguish between a **temporary** and **permanent** nuisance:
      1. **Permanent** - statute of limitations begins at the time nuisance begins
      2. **Temporary** - your claim “accrues anew upon each injury”

**MAJORITY RULE: REASONABLE USE TEST:** Restatement (Second) of Torts, 3-4

1. Is defendant’s act a proximate cause?
2. Is the plaintiff’s interest within the right to the “use and enjoyment of land”?
   1. Examples: (1) freedom from pollution, (2) noise, (3) odor, and (4) smoke.
3. Is the interference substantial?
   1. A court will consider the **effect on a normal person of ordinary habits and sensibilities**, focusing on factors that include the:
   2. What is the **extent** of the harm?
   3. What is the **character** of the harm?
4. [Is the invasion **intentional or negligent**? ]
5. Is the harm **unreasonable**?
   1. What are the economic and social values of the activity?
   2. Is the activity suitable for the location?
   3. Who came first, plaintiff or activity?
   4. What is the practicability and fairness of making either party avoid the conflict?
   5. A court will weigh the gravity of the harm done to the plaintiffs against the benefits caused by the defendant’s use of the land and the suitability of the use (Coasean Influence). A court may consider the:
      1. Economic and social value of the conflicting activities
      2. Suitability of the activities for the location
      3. Ability of either party to avoid the conflict and practicability of and fairness of making the party do so.
   6. **NOTE:** In determining whether to classify the defendant’s conduct as a nuisance, courts weigh the utility of the defendant’s conduct in the defendant’s favor 🡪 A defendant whose behavior is socially beneficial gets more leeway to impose costs on its neighbors than a defendant whose behavior is not socially beneficial.
   7. However, the focus remains on the **impact of the defendant’s conduct on the plaintiff** (Classical Influence). The fact that a defendant’s conduct is socially valuable is not decisive.
6. Any **additional fairness and/or welfare concerns**?
7. Fairness:

* Character of the harm: aesthetic harms will be viewed as not as serious as health and safety
  + - Courts have historically been reluctant to find visual annoyances (without smell/threat to safety) to constitute a nuisance. But becoming more allowed to sue based on this (*Rattigan v. Wile:* p. 353).
* Distributive considerations: is it fair to make owner bear costs of defendant’s socially beneficial activity, or should the costs be spread to the owner causing damage?
* Fault: is owner engaged in disfavored activity? Inappropriate for area? Did plaintiff come to the nuisance?

1. Welfare:

* Costs and benefits of allowing the harmful conduct v. cost of prohibiting it
* Incentives: to engage in the respective activities. What effects will liability/immunity have?
* Lower cost avoider: which party can more cheaply avoid the cost?

1. What is the **appropriate remedy**? (discussed below)

**Policy Critiques**

* Standard, not rule. No hard and fast test, no hierarchy of how factors weigh, so gives a lot of power to trial judge
* Rule would be more administrable/efficient. Clear, so people would sue each other less
* Doesn’t give adequate warning to person who might create the nuisance. What’s too loud for your neighbors?

**CIVIL LAW/NATURAL FLOW RULE (“sic utere”)**

Property owners must use their property in a way that does not injure their neighbors. You have a strict liability/veto rights remedy—the injured plaintiff has legal rights to injunction and damages

1. **Justifications**:

* **Fair**—everyone gets protection from damages to their investment—you get security.
* **Efficient**—it would give incentives against property damage and to make your investment safe to use

1. **Problems**: **Not Socially Useful** (disincentivizes development)

**What is the remedy?**

* 1. Court decide which remedy to apply.
  2. In deciding which remedy to apply, courts will consider variety of factors, focusing in particular on the **costs and benefits of the defendant’s conduc**t.
  3. This focus on the costs and benefits of the defendant’s conduct reflects the influence of law and economics analysis of nuisance.
     + \*\*Instead of simply granting an injunction, a court will consider a variety of factors to decide how to protect the entitlement in an efficient way. These factors include transaction costs, i.e. the likelihood that the parties will bargain. [Coasean Influence; Melamed & Calabresi Influence]

The question of whether there is a nuisance and what is the remedy is 2 prongs and should NOT be conflated with one another. In assessing whether invasion of interest was unreasonable court should weigh utility of D conduct. But the social utility of the D’s actions is NOT definitive.

* First step on P, second step is on the D’s conduct,
  + Cost/benefits focused on the second part of the analysis

**Public Nuisance** (p. 354)

* **“**an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public” (Torts Second Restatement)
* Used to only be able to sue if public official. Trend is to allow any member of the public affected by the activity to bring claim (Second Restatement). Can sue for injunction or monetary damages.
  + Statutes may authorize this (*Kellner v. Capelini*)
* Been used against liquor stores selling to minors, motels & prostitution (*Miami v. Keshbro*), theatre/stores selling or showing pornographic material.

**Nuisance Defenses** (p. 352)

* Two common defenses:

1. D got there first
   1. Not an absolute defense usually
   2. Some states allow it to be an absolute defense when P came to nuisance and knew about it beforehand
   3. In *Spur* (development set up near farm which was already there) court granted injunction to P on condition that they pay for D relocation costs
2. P is too sensitive/Unusual Sensitivity
   1. *Jenkins:* NO remedy for P who had extremely sensitive allergy to fumes

***Johnson v. Paynesville* (Minn. 2012): ESTABLISHING CAUSATION**

* Facts: Johnsons owned organic fields next to conventional non-organic fields. Paynesville sprayed pesticides onto adjacent fields and wind allegedly caused some pesticides to drift onto Johnsons’ fields, so Johnsons stopped selling their soybeans and alfalfa as organic for 3 years.
  + Brought suit for trespass AND nuisance .
* Holding: The sprayed pesticides are intangible, particulate matter. Thus, even if they did drift onto the Johnsons’ crops, such drift CANNOT constitute trespass under Minnesota law. The Johnsons do not assert that the Cooperative’s spraying prevented them from possessing their land exclusively. Rather, the Johnsons’ claim is that the spraying prevented them from selling their crops organically. This is a claim of interference with the Johnsons’ use of their land, which is a claim for nuisance.
* Importance: Court declines to get rid of the distinctions between trespass and nuisance.
* Rule: When the invasion of a plaintiff’s land is committed by an intangible agency, such as particulate matter, such invasion does NOT constitute trespass. But, this type of invasion may constitute nuisance if the intangible agency interferes with the landowner’s use or enjoyment of his land.

Notes

* Court cites *Bradley* (Alabama law) which says that particulate matter CAN be trespass.
  + Concern would be that this would open up floodgates of litigation. To mitigate against this risk *Bradley* requires **reasonable foresee-ableness that it will cause damage.**
  + Common law should change b/c of how we live.
* Court rules against this logic, saying that *Bradley* mixed up trespass and nuisance. So, if you only say its trespass when there is damage (b/c you are mixing it up with nuisance) then you are taking away one of the main aspects of trespass law (*Jack v. Steinberg* case of pulling mobile home across the land 🡪 court applied trespass even though there was no damage).
  + \*Nuisance is about harm, and trespass is the right to exclude

**Coase Theorem**: Asks the court to neutralize the assumption that the person who is causing the damage is the only person creating costs. Courts should consider the action which the person must refrain from as a cost.

* Reciprocal nature of costs – Costs are imposed on both sides.

***Dobbs v. Wiggins* (Ill. 2016): ESTABLISHING SUBSTANTIAL AND UNREASONABLE HARM; DECIDING REMEDIES**

* Facts: Wiggins moved in next door 15 years after Dobbses and began breeding, selling, kenneling dogs. Had up to 100 on his property at one point. As he increased number of dogs on his property, neighbors began complaining and he attempted unsuccessfully to mitigate the noise. Dobbses sought an injunction on grounds that Wiggins’s barking dogs constituted a nuisance. Testified that noise prevented them from enjoying their land as they had before he moved in: kept windows open, yard work, sat/hosted outside.
* Holding: The noise was **substantial** and **unreasonable**. The circuit court was within its discretion to outweigh the harm to the Dobbses v. the utility of Wiggins’s business & the suitability of his land for such a business, and determine that the use was a nuisance.
  + Dobbses were on the land first, and given Wiggins’s prior failed attempts, mitigating the noise without limiting the number of dogs is not possible.
  + Affirmed but remanded to determine the correct number of bird dogs allowed(erred in limiting to only 6, must be some number between 6 and 69 that won’t tank the business and won’t be a substantial invasion for plaintiffs.)
* Rule: Reasonable Use Test (majority rule) – To maintain a claim for nuisance, a plaintiff must prove that the alleged invasion of his right to use/enjoy his property is (1) **substantial**, (2) **intentional or negligent,** (3) **unreasonable**.
  + In determination, courts examine the effects of the invasive conduct on a reasonable person. The allegedly invasive conduct must be substantially physically offensive to the senses.

### Nuisance Part 2: Choice of Remedy

**CASES**: *Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.* (NY 1969), *Fontainebleau v. Forty Five* (Fla. 1959)

Early America: Nuisance → Automatic Injunction. Industrialized America: Retreat from Automatic Injunction.

**Law and Economics Theories (380-92)**

According to economic analysis we try to have the most efficient outcome and rule of law. This would try and minimize externalities.

1. **Classical Economics** – Externalities: costs imposed on third parties that are NOT taken into account in the actor’s own cost-benefit determinations.
   1. Internalize: classic economic analysis of nuisance sought to make the factory to pay for and therefore internalize the external harms that its operation causes.
   2. Internalize externality harm to 3rd party and would just have to pay
2. **Coase Style Argument (1960):** think about reciprocal costs – costs on BOTH parties (externalities are reciprocal). Therefore, the judge must think about JOINT costs.
   1. In Coase’s view, the classical economics approach doesn’t help courts decide who, as between two conflicting land uses, should be internalizing the externalities.
      1. In a world where every land use generates costs, why not instead ask homeowners to internalize the costs of their land use (homeowning next to a factory) by asking these homeowners to pay $100,000 to a factory to install pollution control devices…or leave?
   2. Care about who values the land/entitlement the most. When not able to determine who values the cost the most the court will look to who is able to avoid the costs best.
   3. Case-by-Case – Both parties will buy back their entitlements in a second transaction.
      1. If transaction costs are zero and property rights over the relevant resources are well-defined, parties involved in an externality situation will bargain to an efficient resolution, regardless of to whom the property rights are initially assigned.

Other theories:

1. Pigou Style Argument: Bright-Line Rule – Nuisance-feasors should have to internalize its costs of doing business. Assign entitlements to injured parties to be free of harm.
2. Sunstein and Thaler: Case-by-case – Coase is wrong! Transaction costs are too high and people are not rational enough! Courts should assign the entitlement to the party most willing to pay in order to maximize total welfare.
3. Posner: Case-by-Case – But if initial distributions of wealth are unjust, deriving entitlements from willingness to pay will undermine claims to justice.
4. Prioritarianism (a): Case-by-Case – Weigh costs/benefits felt by worse-off party more heavily than those felt by better-off.
5. Prioritarianism (b): Bright-Line Rule – Serve distributive justice and anti-commodification values by creating bright-line rules to protect vulnerable populations!

A court that has moved from classical model to Coase, the remedy is formulated as most efficient outcome.

1. After the court has handed out their **initial legal allocation**, the parties are able to bargain and theoretically whoever values the property the most can either keep it or buy it from opposing party.
   1. This assumes that there is NO transaction costs
2. But there are transaction costs which would make it hard for parties to properly bargain for efficiency 🡪 p. 384 lists transaction costs
3. **So the court could help efficiency by assigning entitlement to the parties who values the entitlement the most.**
   1. Issue with this is how does the court decide who values it the most?
   2. Can measure value on open market, etc.
4. If the court can’t evaluate who values the costs the most, then liability rules should be applied.
   1. Property is injunction, liability is damages 🡪 Calabresi & Melamed article
   2. Under Calebrisi the parties can bargain

| --- | --- | --- |
| **HYPOTHETICAL DAMAGES BASED ON EACH THEOREM**  Calabresi & Melamed, Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Inalienability: One View of the Cathedral, Harv. L. Rev. (1972) | | |
| **REMEDIES** | **PLAINTIFF’S ENTITLEMENT** | **DEFENDANT’S ENTITLEMENT** |
| **Property Rule**  (old)  (preferable if low transaction costs of second transaction) | Courts fix an absolute entitlement (injunction or a no liability) and parties can bargain around it in a second transaction. **Price of the entitlement is fixed by private bargaining rather than court later.** | |
| Injunction | No nuisance |
| P can get an injunction ordering D to stop the harmful conduct.  D may continue to commit the harm, provided D offers P enough money to induce P to give up P’s right to be safe from harm. | D has an entitlement to commit the harm without liability.  P may prevent the harm, provided P offers D enough money to induce D to agree to stop the harmful conduct. |
| **Liability Rule**  (new)  (preferable if high transaction costs of second transaction) | Court determines cost of entitlement. Either D must pay damages to continue use to which she is not otherwise entitled, or P must pay damages in order to get injunction to stop use to which D is entitled. | |
| Damages | Purchased injunction |
| P can get damages from D for committing the harm, but no injunction.  D may continue to commit the harm, provided D pays the court determined amount. | P can stop D’s conduct if P is willing to pay damages as determined by a court to compensate D for D’s loss of profits. |

\*\*USE RULE OF THUMBS IN MAKING ARGUMENT

**RULES OF THUMB in Deciding REMEDY:**

1. Low Transaction Costs 🡪 Property rules should be used – parties will negotiate.
2. High Transaction Costs 🡪 Liability rules should be used – parties will NOT be able to negotiate, court should approximate damages.
3. Easier for court to more accurately obtain information about damages than to determine who values an entitlement 🡪 Liability rules (damages).
   1. Even if the court assigns the entitlement incorrectly, a party who values the entitlement more highly will simply pay the damages remedy and proceed.
4. TO KNOW WHO VALUES AN ENTITLEMENT MOST, A COURT MIGHT:
   1. Measure the value of entitlement on the open market
   2. Alternatively, determine who can avoid harm most cheaply
   3. **If a court can measure damages more accurately than it can obtain information about who values an entitlement, it can encourage efficiency by resorting to a liability rule.**

### CALABRESI AND MELAMED

1. **Property rules**: Define a legal entitlement
   1. Civil law rule: You have an entitlement not to be harmed
   2. Calabresi and Melameht prefer this one—you should only deviate from the property rule if the transactions costs are so high that the parties can’t contract
2. **Liability rules**: A court is trying to figure out who is responsible
   1. Reasonable use rule: were you substantially harmed enough that your neighbor has to pay?
3. Difference from **Coase**: wants to focus more on *remedies*.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | **PROPERTY RULE**  The value of the entitlement is negotiated by the parties themselves—whoever values it most/is willing to pay the most gets the entitlement | **LIABILITY RULE**  The Court decides how much the entitlement is worth |
| **P HAS ENTITLEMENT** | **RULE 1**: Injunction   1. P gets the injunction 2. P has the entitlement and D must pay P to give up the entitlement | **RULE 2**: Damages   1. P is awarded damages 2. P owns entitlement, but D may commit harm if D is willing/able to pay damages |
| **D HAS ENTITLEMENT** | **RULE 3** (*Fountainbleau*): No Nuisance   1. P does not get injunction, must pay D to stop 2. D has the entitlement | **RULE 4**: Purchased Injunction   1. P purchases injunction 2. D has the entitlement |

**APPLICATION TO CASES**

1. **In *Boomer*, Rule 2 applied**: Boomer gets damages, and Atlantic Cement can continue to commit the harm if it can pay those damages
2. **In *Fontainbleu*, Rule 3 applied**: ER has to pay what FB is willing to accept to induce FB to stop building

***Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.* (NY 1969):** **INJUNCTION V. DAMAGES IN NUISANCE**

* Facts: Atlantic Cement has factory that releases dust, smoke, vibrations. Boomer and neighbors sued for injunction and damages alleging injury to property.
* Holding: Grants injunction until Atlantic Cement pays Boomer permanent damages. Injunction here would require Atlantic to completely close its operation unless a cleaner method of producing cement could be found; unfair to Atlantic (pollution problem is experienced by all cement factories). The economic benefit of keeping the factory open is greater than the harm suffered by Boomer, so most equitable solution is to award a temporary injunction.
  + **Efficient**: Liability rule is the best here, because there are potential transactions costs that come with group bargaining on the Boomer side—“holdover” and “free rider” problems;
    - The court just decides how valuable the entitlement is- MUCH SIMPLER
    - The court might not value Boomer’s home as much as they do, since it is so personal to them
  + **Efficient**: the factory internalizes its costs, rather than externalizing them onto Boomer
  + **Socially useful**: Atlantic Cement still gets to operate
  + **Fair**: everyone gets a little of what they want—Boomer gets damages, Atlantic Cement gets to operate
* **Dissent**: By deviating from the rule that continuous nuisances are subject to injunctions, the majority is perpetuating the country’s pollution problem. By allowing Atlantic to continue its operations upon paying permanent damages, no further incentive to develop clean technology. Essentially, majority is allowing Atlantic to continue to commit a wrong, if they pay upfront for it.
* Rule: Permanent damages, as opposed to an injunction, are appropriate when the damages resulting from a nuisance are significantly less than the economic benefit derived from the party causing the harm.

***Fountainbleau v. Forty-Five Twenty-Five* (Fla. 1959):**

* Facts: The Fontainebleau Hotel began constructing a fourteen-story addition. Eden Roc Hotel next door would have addition’s shadow (light and air). Eden Roc attempting to enjoin construction.
  + ER claims: (1) cause irreparable damage, that (2) FB is motivated by malice, that (3) FB’s plan is violating building ordinances, and that (4) FB is interfering with ER’s easements of light and air it has enjoyed for the past 20 years
* Holding: There is NO legal right to the free flow of light or air across one’s property, absent a contractual or statutory obligation to the contrary.
  + **Socially useful:** where a structure serves a useful purpose, it does not give rise to a cause of action, either for damages or an injunction, even though it causes injury
  + **Public Policy**: Miami wants to encourage development, especially during such a massive boom in tourism.
    - Why court rejects the “ancient lights” rule—interferes with development
  + **Judicial role:** this is a zoning problem in a rapidly changing society, it might be better for the Miami legislature to figure out what it wants to preference here
    - A court could never predict how its decisions would change Miami—so it should stick to the existing rule (which it does)
* Rule: A landowner may use his property in a reasonable way as long as it does not injure the legal rights of another.

**LAW AND ECONOMICS PERSPECTIVE**

* The court rejects the civil law rule here and adopts the common enemy rule. ER might NOT want the Coase theory applied and would rather want FB to **internalize costs of the harms**.
* ER would claim that there ARE transaction costs and we have parties who don’t seem to be acting rationally, so the party who may get the entitlement is NOT the one who values it the most but rather the one who is acting the MOST irrationally.
  + Also have a bi-lateral monopoly situation here so might not be good negotiations here
* Why a civil law rule might be more efficient (ER’s argument):
  1. The balance of the number of rooms gained by FB probably will NOT outweigh the balance of rooms lost by ER. If ER goes out of business, this is ultimately losing Miami more rooms.
  2. So FB should INTERNALIZE the costs by not building, rather than externalizing the costs onto ER.
  3. **FB’s response:** you can just as easily flip it and say that ER is hurting FB by keeping FB from developing its land

## Regulating the Right to Use through Servitudes

### Law of Servitudes: Express Easements

**CASES**: *Green v. Lupo* (Wash. 1982), *Cox v. Glenbrook Co.* (Nev. 1962)

**Servitude**: right or an obligation that “runs with the land” meaning that it automatically passes to subsequent owners or possessors of the land.

* More akin to law of contracts than of nuisance

**SOME BASIC VOCAB**

1. **Affirmative servitude (Easement)**: a right to use ANOTHER’S land for a limited purpose
   1. Easements, right of way for ingress/egress, leases, and profits (right to gather resources from another’s land)
2. **Negative servitude (Covenant)**: a restriction with respect to what OWNERS can do with their land
   1. Negative easements, real covenants, and equitable servitudes
3. **Burdened/Servient Estate**: Land subject to the **burden** of a servitude
4. **Benefited/Dominant Estate**: Land benefited from the servitude
5. **Appurtenant servitudes**: Servitudes that “RUN WITH THE LAND,” and automatically passed to subsequent owners or possessors
6. **Servitudes “in gross”**: Servitudes in which the benefit is held by a PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY rather than running with a parcel of land
   1. Ex. A utility company that moves its headquarters still has the servitudes of the power lines

**Affirmative servitudes** **(EASEMENTS)**: rights to use another’s land for a limited purpose.

* Most common type: right of way.
* Another type: profit a prendre – allows non-owners to collect resources from the land.
* Fee simple/and of the fees 🡪 main difference is what happens when you breach.
  + Covenants viewed through breaching contract, breaching Fee Simple is usually forfeiture.

**Negative servitudes** **(modernly - “covenants”)**: restrictions with respect to what owners can do with their own land.

* Traditionally limited to:
  1. Right to lateral support of one’s building
  2. Rights to prevent both light and air from being blocked by construction on neighboring land
  3. Right to prevent interference with the flow of an artificial stream such as an aqueduct
* Examples of negative easements:
  1. Conservation easements – preventing development of land for environmental purposes
  2. Historic preservation easements – preventing destruction or alteration of buildings that have historical or architectural importance
  3. Solar easements – to protect access to sunlight for solar energy
* **Appurtenant Easement:** runs with land
  1. Dominant Estate – benefited by the appurtenant easement
  2. Servient Estate – burdened by the appurtenant easement
* **Easement in Gross**: benefit is held by a particular individual/entity rather
  1. Servient Estate: burdened by the easement in gross
  2. Apportionability: question of divisibility of the easement
  3. Nonexclusive: grantor of the servient estate has reserved for himself the right to use the easement in conjunction with the grantee, easement is generally held to be nonapportionable
  4. Exclusive: grantor has NO right to use the easement in conjunction with the grantee

**PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPRESS EASEMENTS**

An express easement will run with the burdened or benefited estate if:

1. Writing – the original easement is in writing and complies with the Statute of Frauds
2. Notice – for the burden to run on subsequent owners of the servient estate, the subsequent owners must have notice
   * Actual notice – if the subsequent owners in fact know about the existence of the easement
   * Inquiry notice – if there are visible signs of use by non-owners, such as telephone poles, above-ground utility lines, or a path across the property, the owner may be put on inquiry notice
   * Constructive notice – if the deed conveying the easement is recorded in the proper registry of deeds in the proper place, and if a reasonable search of the registry would lead to discovery of the deed, then subsequent owners are deemed to be on constructive notice
3. Intent – the grantor of the easement intends for the deed to bind future owners of the servient estate (or future owners of the dominant estate).

INTERPRETING AN EXPRESS EASEMENT

1. Is the written instrument **ambiguous**?
2. Is there a **presumption** against easement in gross? (See 521-2)
3. Is the servient owner entitled to **impose reasonable restraints** on a right of way? (See 522)

***Green v. Lupo* (Wash. 1982): CATEGORY OF EASEMENT**

* Facts: Greens own a parcel of land with a house, sold northern portion to Lupo. Lupo requested a deed release for part of the property, and Greens agreed in exchange for the promise of an easement over part of Lupo's portion. The terms of the easement were contained in a written agreement, which provided, among other things, that the easement was promised to "Don Green and Florence B. Green," and that easement was "for ingress and egress for road and utilities purpose." The easement was to allow the Greens to have access to the land retained by the Greens to build and live in a cabin.
  + Greens used some of their remaining land for mobile homes, and some of the mobile-home residents used the easement as a practice runway for their motorcycles. This caused tension between Lupo and Greens, and Lupo refused to formally grant the easement. Lupo also blocked the easement to restrict access from the Greens' property.
  + The Greens brought suit to specifically enforce the easement agreement.
  + **ISSUE**—Do the occupants of the mobile home have an easement, as well as the Plaintiffs? 🡪 Was easement in gross or appurtenant?
* Holding: Easement was granted specifically to Greens for the purpose of "ingress and egress for road and utilities." This is an ambiguous conveyance, b/c it is both to specific people AND for a purpose that benefits the dominant estate. Considering all the facts and circumstances, however, was an EASEMENT APPURTENANT. Granted to give access to the land for purposes of building/inhabiting cabin on the property. This reference to the land with no language limiting access to only the Greens, when combined with the presumption of appurtenance, weigh in favor of finding the easement to be appurtenant.
* Rule: There is a presumption that an easement is appurtenant to a parcel of land and NOT an easement in gross.
  + **Practical reasons** for the presumption: it’s easier to have one easement attached to land than for many people have get to have an in gross easement, as well as all the people they convey their property to;

Notes:

* An easement granted for purposes such as roads, utilities, ingress, and egress is an easement appurtenant because it benefits the adjacent parcel. An easement appurtenant becomes part of the land that it benefits, and it passes with possession of the dominant parcel unless it is otherwise limited.
* \*\*By contrast, an easement that **designates a specific person** as the dominant owner 🡪 more likely to be considered an easement in gross.
* If the conveyance of land is ambiguous, **parol evidence** is admissible to help determine whether the parties intended an express easement to be appurtenant or in gross.
  + The court may consider the unique circumstances of the parties and the property, as well as the parties’ conduct and admissions, in making this determination.

***Cox v. Glenbrook Co.* (Nev. 1962): SCOPE OF EASEMENT**

* Facts: Glenbrook Company resort granted easement to Quill for use of Glenbrook back road to get to Quill house. The road primarily used (back road) had only enough room for one car to pass through at a time. Glenbrook granted an easement in writing “over the roads of [Glenbrook] as now located” to Quill, “his heirs and assigns forever.” When Quill died, Kenneth Johnson bought property, then sold to Cox who proposed dividing property into smaller parcels to develop it into a residential area, widening back road, and possibly allowing future residents of development to use it.
  + Parties sought declaratory judgment on scope and extent of easement.
* Holding: Cox may subdivide the easement, allowing for multiple easement holders so long as their use does not cause an UNREASONABLE BURDEN to Glenbrook in the future.
  + Widening of the back road so that two cars can pass at the same time is NOT a kind of use that Glenbrook or Quill contemplated in the Quill Easement, and would impose an undue burden on servient estate and CAN’T be done.
* Rule: When a right-of-way granted by easement appurtenant is conveyed to a new easement holder, the use of the easement must be of the kind contemplated by the grantor and must NOT constitute an unreasonable burden on the servient estate that was not contemplated by the grantor. The use of the easement must conform to the intent of the original parties, or it risks reaching beyond the scope.
* Argument FOR the ***Green v. Lupo*** SUBDIVISIBILITY RULE:
  + **Necessity**: all subdivided owners would still need it, not just the original owners;
  + **Efficient**: Makes land more alienable and promotes development, because you can build beyond just one single-family home;
  + **Fairness**: expectations are frustrated if deprived of use.
* Argument AGAINST the subdivisibility rule:
  + **Efficiency:** Glenbrook property is made *less* alienable if burdened by dominant estate owner’s use (why we have **undue burden** test). Also, may incentivize development to an excessive degree.
    - Was **intended** only for Quill, and for one person.
  + **Fairness**: Glenbrook developed first (should be awarded for labor, investment)

### Easements By Implication: By Estoppel, Prior Use, Necessity

**CASES**: *Lobato v. Taylor* (Colo. 2002), *Granite Properties v. Manns* (Ill. 1987), *Finn v. Williams* (Ill. 1941)

Four ways an easement can be created without writing (**implied easements**):

1. **Easements by estoppel** (*Lobato*)—when a landowner grants the claimant **permission** to use the property in such a way that (1) would foreseeably induce a reasonable user to substantially change position in reliance on the believe that the permission will not be revoked; (2) the user substantially so changes her position; and (3) revoking the permission would cause substantial injustice
   1. When courts will find an easement by estoppel:
      1. Parties intended to create an easement but failed to comply with the statute of frauds
      2. Reasonable reliance on the continuation of consent—there is no proof of the grantor’s intent to create an easement but the grantor permitted another to use the land and the elements above are satisfied
      3. Where there has been fraud or misrepresentation about the existence of or intent to grant an easement.
   2. Some jurisdictions reject easement by estoppel completely (*Kitchen v. kitchen)*
   3. **Constructive Trust**: an equitable exception to the statute of frauds that may be granted where legal title to property for the express benefit of another has been obtained through actual FRAUD, misrepresentations, concealments, taking advantage of one’s necessities, or under circumstances otherwise rendering it unconscionable for the holder of legal title to retain beneficial interest in property (note: apply same elements as estoppel)
2. **Easements by Prescription**: created through adverse and open use of the land continuously until the expiration of the statute of limitations for trespass (*Lobato*; *Community Feed Store*)
   1. Elements the same as an adverse possession claim, **but need to only show *use*, not *possession***
   2. Negative easements **cannot** be acquired by prescription
   3. **Acquiescence**—number of states require the claimant to prove acquiescence by the true owner; acquiescence may mean the true owner:
      1. Failed to bring a trespass action
      2. Knew about the use and allowed it to continue
      3. Should have known about the use and did nothing
   4. Some courts maintain that acquiescence merely means that the owner did NOT assert her right to exclude by bringing a trespass action, or that a reasonable owner should have known.
3. **Easements by Prior Use/Quasi-easement/Easement by Implication** (*Lobato*)
   1. Created when:
      1. The servient and dominant estates were once under common ownership;
      2. One parcel was previously used for the benefit of the other parcel in a manner that was
         1. continuous and
         2. apparent
      3. The use is “reasonably necessary” OR “convenient” for the enjoyment of the dominant estate
         1. Usually for rights of way for passage of people/vehicles
      4. A contrary intention is neither expressed nor implied
4. **Easements by Necessity** (*Finn*): servient and dominant estate were once under common ownership and upon severance the part of the state becomes LANDLOCKED, requiring a right of way over the other part of the severed estate to access a public road.
   1. **Dormancy**: An easement by necessity may lay dormant through successive transfers of title, and yet pass with each transfer as appurtenant to the dominant estate and be exercised at any time by the holder of title thereto. (*Finn*)
   2. The easement by necessity disappears when, at any point a legal right of ingress/egress is accessed through alternative routes. A mere license to use an alternative route however, will NOT eliminate the easement by necessity.
   3. **Policy** justification:
      1. Promote efficient utilization of property—buyers will not agree to purchase a landlocked property
      2. BUT some courts will say no necessity if grantor and buyer *knew* they were buying a landlocked property

***Lobato v. Taylor (Colo. 2002):* EASEMENT BY ESTOPPEL**

* Facts: After Mexican American War, Beaubien acquired a grant of about 1 million acres in future Colorado from Mexico. In 1850s, he recruited families to settle and live on land as farmers.
  1. In 1863, he signed Beaubien Document that granted the settlers rights of access to common lands for resource-gathering. In 1864 Giblin purchased the land on condition that the rights are preserved.
  2. In 1960, Taylor bought a piece of Beaubien land, deed stated that he acquired the tract subject to “claims of the local people by prescription or otherwise to right to pasture, wood, and lumber and so-called settlement rights in, to, and upon said land.” However, Taylor refused to allow local landowners access to the land. Farmers claimed easement rights to access the land.
  3. **ISSUE**—Do the farmworkers have a property interest in the Taylor ranch, even though the Beaubien document does not meet the formal requirements for the express grant of rights?

1. Holding: Easement by estoppel for pasture, firewood, and timber. Requirements (LOOK UP LIST): (1) The rights were **expected** by the settlers, intended by Beaubien under the terms of the Beaubien Document, and **necessary** because utilization of the timber was needed to heat and build homes, and the ability to graze was needed to feed cattle. (2) Settlers moved their entire families from miles around to build houses and farms (**reliance- changed position**). (3) The access rights at issue have been around for over 100 years and were a condition of the land grant to Taylor. To eradicate these rights would constitute an **injustice**.
   1. **Also easement from prior use** 🡪 (1) servient and dominant estate once under common ownership (Beaubien and Gilpin). (2) Rights alleged were exercised prior to severance of the estate. (3) The use was not merely temporary. (4) Continuation of use was necessary to the enjoyment of the parcel)

* Dissent: Majority should not have found an easement by estoppel because there is NO evidence that Beaubien or his successors in interest intended to have the plaintiffs’ predecessors in interest rely to their detriment on the grant.
* Rule: A court CAN imply an easement created by estoppel when: (1) the landowner permitted another party to use the land under circumstances in which it was reasonably foreseeable that the user would substantially change position believing that the permission would not be revoked, (2) the user substantially changed position in reasonable reliance on that belief, and (3) injustice can be avoided only by establishment of a servitude.

Notes

* Taylors would want an easement in gross. Other side would want easement **appurtenant** 🡪 wouldwant to look to intent of the original giver of the easement.
  1. Presumption against easement in gross is also a good argument here. This is b/c easements in gross will add uncertainty.
* Potential argument: wouldn’t apply easement by estoppel when there is a use for profit. But the court says this doesn’t apply.
* Court holds that hunting, fishing, and recreation is NOT part of easement.

***Granite Properties v. Manns* (Ill. 1987):** **EASEMENT BY PRIOR USE, IMPLIED INTENT AND NECESSITY**

* Facts: Granite sold to Manns a part of tract that was in between apartment building and shopping center. Two driveways were each situated on Manns land and Manns knew this when bought the property. Manns found no recorded easements (no notice) but did see the two driveways before buying (constructive notice). Driveways were used by Granite for years before. Even though there was another driveway that led to back of shopping center, use of this driveway was necessary for proper functioning bc there was not enough room in other driveway for large delivery trucks to exit; other driveway led to parking lot of apartment complex and was no other feasible place to put parking lot, was only access point. After Manns bought the tract, told Granite to stop using driveways. Manns want the standard to be “absolutely necessary,” not “reasonably necessary” for access by Granite.
* Holding: Easements from prior use.
  1. (1) Owned entire tract of land and subsequently conveyed the land on which the driveways are situated to the Manns. (2) Manns admitted to noticing Granite’s use of both driveways when they bought the land, Granite’s use was continuous for many years before the conveyance, and Granite’s use is permanent because the driveways were covered in gravel, thus fixed as its present use. (3) Without driveway use, shopping center and apartment complex cannot be run properly.
  2. Easement which benefits the grantor – easement by grant
* Rule: A landowner establishes an easement implied by prior use if he proves: (1) ownership over both the dominant and servient parcels and a subsequent transfer of ownership to the servient parcel, (2) that, before the transfer, the use being claimed was apparent, continuous, and permanent, and (3) the easement is necessary and beneficial to the owner’s use of the property he kept. These requirements are in place because proof of prior use is evidence that the parties intended an easement even if it was left out of the deed.

***Finn v. Williams* (Ill. 1941):** **EASEMENT BY NECESSITY**

* Facts: In 1895, Williams sold part of a parcel to Bacons, who then sold it to Finns. The only means of getting to the nearest highway and market from the Finns’ land was by crossing over Williams’s land or that of a stranger. However, Williams refused to give the Finns permission to cross over her land.
* Holding: Easement by necessity was implied with the conveyance from Williams to Bacon because the ONLY available route to the highway and market for Bacon was over Williams’s land.
* Rule: An implied easement by necessity may lie **dormant** through multiple transfers of land, but it passes with each transfer and may be exercised at any time.
  + Easement by necessity is implied where the only available means of ingress and egress to a highway is over the conveyer’s land or that of a stranger.

### Introduction to Covenant

**CASES**: *Neponsit v. Emigrant Savings* (1938), *Davidson v. D. Katz & Sons* (N.K. 1990), *Nahrstedt v. Lakeside Village* (Cal. 1994), *Neuman v. Grandview* (Fla. 2003)

**Covenant**: Negative servitudes. Restrictions on use of land or obligations regarding land, held by one who does NOT own the land.

* Key difference with covenants and fee simple determinable/FSSCS is that breaking fee results in forfeiture of land. Not so in covenants.
  + Breach of covenant is remedied by damages or injunction
* Covenants created common rules for ownership development in 20th century (ex: height of houses, exclude people based on race)

**A note on terminology:** In the past a negative easement, real covenant, equitable servitudes all had their own meaning. As time went on there has been a movement away from this and to treat all three of these under the single heading of covenant on the land.

**Negative easements 🡪 Real Covenants and Equitable Servitudes**:

At early common law, negative easements were restrictions on land held by others. Over time negative easements were limited b/c of concern that keeping of the status quo would prevent useful development of land. Limited to three categories:

1. Rights of lateral support of one’s buildings
2. Rights to free flow of light and air
3. Rights to water from an artificial stream

Landowners entered into contracts to get around these limitations. But these contract rights generally did NOT bind/benefit subsequent parties. Had to be in PRIVITY OF CONTRACT, or parties to original contract, to be bound or entitled to enforce its benefits. So real covenants developed to solve the problem that negative easements didn’t run with the land.

**Real Covenants**: Agreement could bind successors to land if it was. (\*note that most jurisdictions have tacked on notice req here as well)

1. In **writing**
   * Complying with Statute of Frauds. And like all transfers of property interests lasting more than a year, the covenant must be created in writing signed by the grantor.
     + A covenant written in a deed satisfies this requirement.
2. **Intended** to bind future tenants/run with land
   * Intent may be established through language declaring the covenant is “on behalf of owner and his successors or assigns”, or that the covenant “runs with the land”
   * If the covenant is appurtenant, courts presume the grantor intended it to run with the land (*Sun Oil Co. v. Trent Auto Wash, Inc.*)
   * Some courts require clear evidence of intent to run with land (*Charping v. J.P. Scurry* & *Tennsco Corp. v. Attea*)s
3. **Touched and concerned** the land (affected use of the land itself) (ONLY SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENT of the 4/5)
   * Intended to identify the kinds of obligations that should attach to land as opposed to individuals
   * Benefits the dominant estate and burdens the servient estate. On the burden side, covenant must affect the use and enjoyment of the land. On the benefit side, an obligation touches and concerns a dominant estate if it improves enjoyment of the land OR increases its market value.
     + When NO land if benefited T&C can fall away
     + In *Neponset* court found that fees, which are usually contract law, were T&C b/c fees were used to maintain common element of community and preserving the value of the properties in the community
   * \*No clear test so rule of thumb: the covenant must affect the LEGAL RIGHTS of the parties as landowners
4. There was **privity of estate** (mutual ownership of the land/simultaneous interests in same land) between covenanting parties
   * **Instantaneous** **privity**: Finding privity if a covenant was created during the legal transfer of land. Fiction: at the moment the deed passes from seller to buyer, parties have a fleeting simultaneous interest in property.
     + Prevents restriction of real covenants to landlord-tenants, expands to seller-buyer.
   * **Horizontal** privity: between original covenanting parties
     + Common Examples of no privity: (1) common agreement between owners without a transaction; (2) after the fact privity.
     + If all the owners of properties get together and decide to do something, then there is NOT horizontal privity b/c there is NO sale or friction of a sale to bind the parties.
       - **No transaction, No privity**
   * **Vertical** privity: between original covenanting parties and succeeding owners
     + **Strict**: transfer of ownership. Grantor does NOT retain any future interests in the land. Outright sale.
     + **Relaxed**: lease. Allows covenants to run to all those assigned possession, tenants. Adopted by many courts. (*Whitinsville Plaza v. Kotseas*)
   * Modern trend is to do away with privity requirement but lots of states still have
5. Almost all court today now require notice as well (below in Equitable Servitudes)
   * **REMEMBER: Equitable Servitudes require the same thing, except that (1) it swaps privity for notice AND (2) the relief is injunctive, not damages.**

**Real Covenants v. Equitable Servitudes**:

* Real covenants require privity, equitable servitudes do NOT. ES require notice instead.
* Remedy for real Covenants is damages; remedy for ES is injunction.
* After WW2 many courts relaxed restrictions on covenants, and covenants and equitable servitudes law merged. Modified /abolished privity requirement, touch and concern requirement
* \*\*\*Some courts still adhere.

**Equitable Servitudes**: Same things as Covenants, except that (1) it swaps out privity for NOTICE of restriction AND (2) the relief is injunctive, not damages. Three types of notivce.

1. **Actual Notice**: Actually told about it, or otherwise made aware of it.
   1. *Neponsit*: Unclear if Emigrant was on actual notice when purchased property at foreclosure sale.
2. **Implied/Inquiry Notice**: if condition of the premises would make a reasonable purchaser inquire about the condition of the covenant
   1. Less likely to be found than inquiry notice for easement (right of way) b/c in easements its easier for buyer to observe (b/c they are positive things) while in ES/covenants they are negative non-actions which are harder to observe.
3. **Constructive**: if restriction was recorded within the registry of deeds and could be found via a reasonable search of the records prior to sale.
   1. Reasonable purchaser is expected to search the title to find out whether the property is burdened by land use restrictions
   2. *Neponsit*: Every deed in Emigrant’s chain of title provided that the conveyances were “subject to covenants and restrictions of former deeds of record”

**Third Restatement:** Tries to restructure covenants to make them enforceable unless against public policy. Drafters of restatement tries to clean up everything up and goes a bit too far. Most states are somewhere between traditional view and restatement.

1. Abolishes the distinction between negative easements, real covenants, and equitable servitudes
2. Abolish the horizontal privity requirement entirely, on the basis that **intent and notice requirements serve the interests of intent and notice more directly**
   1. Still required in *Cunningham v. Greensboro (N.C. 2011)*
3. \*Abolish the T&C requirement, and instead place burden on party seeking non-enforcement to show that the covenant VIOLATES PUBLIC POLICY for reasons that include, but are not limited to…
   1. Arbitrary, spiteful, or capricious,
   2. Unreasonably burden a fundamental constitutional right
   3. Impose an unreasonable restraint on alienation
   4. Imposes an unreasonable restraint on trade or competition.
   5. Unconscionable.
4. \*\*But…elements of the old T&C remain:
   1. Covenants that have NOTHING to do with the land may be arbitrary
   2. Requires that **beneficiary of the covenant be identifiable + legitimate interest.**
5. Provides that covenants should be interpreted to further the intent of the parties and carry out purposes.

**Implied Reciprocal Negative Servitudes**

Problem: If a developer wants to restrict development for residential purposes, she may place covenants in each deed binding purchasers to restrict the property.

1. While purchasers get benefit of covenants earlier buyers are subjected to, those earlier buyers cannot enforce covenants on later buyers – lack of privity. The **Doctrine of Implied Reciprocal Negative Servitudes** (IRNS) solves that problem
2. When an owner sells a number of parcels with **evidence of intent** to create a common plan or scheme of development, then 1) **covenants made to the seller benefit all parcels** within the plan, and 2) **all parcels within the plan are bound** by the covenants.
3. How to show **intent**:
   1. Statutes may require developers to file a **declaration** prior to selling individual lots, describing area to be covered.
      1. Declaration constitutes promise to constrict remaining lots when they are sold (**grantor covenant**)
      2. Buyers are on **constructive notice** of the restrictions in the declaration **if it is recorded prior to their purchase**. (*Riley v. Bear Creek*)
   2. **Observance by owners** of similar development (*Sanborn*)
   3. Intent to create a common plan may be inferred (*Sanborn*) based on number of lots in a subdivision that have a covenant.
      1. Owners are on **inquiry notice** to determine if there were restrictive covenants on neighboring lots that might be interpreted to create a plan to restrict an entire neighborhood (*Sanborn*)
   4. The presence of restrictions in all or most deeds in the area
   5. A recorded plat (map) showing the restrictions
   6. Presence of restrictions in the **last deed** (since common owner no remaining interest);
   7. **Language of deed itself** that says it runs with the land.

***Neponsit v. Emigrant Savings* (1938): TRADITIONAL TEST FOR REAL COVENANTS**

* Facts: In 1911, Neponsit Realty Company developed land as a residential community and sold the property to Deyers. The deeds contained a covenant requiring the purchaser and all successors to pay an annual fee to the Neponsit Property Owners’ Association (POA) for maintaining common areas like roads. Covenant gave Neponsit/successors the right to foreclose a lien for failure to make payment, expressly stated that it was a real covenant running with the land.Emigrant bought the property at a foreclosure sale. Emigrant’s deed contained the covenant. Emigrant failed to pay the fee, POA sued to foreclose on the lien.
* Holding: POA may enforce the covenant. Generally, there must be privity of estate for a claimant to enforce a real covenant. There is technically no privity of estate between a property owner and a homeowners’ association, but based on equitable principles, restrictive covenants have been enforced without privity of estate if the covenant was entered into to benefit the claimant. This case does not involve a restrictive covenant, but the court may look behind the corporate form of the POA. The covenant provided that the POA would be the assignee of the benefit of the covenant. The POA is merely acting as a “medium through which enjoyment of [the owners'] common right may be preserved.” There is privity of estate between the property owners and the POA “in substance, if not in form.”
* Importance: Also gives opportunity to examine what equitable servitudes would look like. Case occurs when ppl are starting to find defeasible fees unappealing.
* Rule: (1) A covenant contained in a deed requiring the payment of money “touches and concerns” the land if it substantially affects the rights of the parties as landowners. (2) Privity of estate will exist in substance if not in form between property owners and an owners’ association when the **association is acting as a medium through which enjoyment of a common right is preserved**.

Notes:

* \*\*Once Neponset sold all the land, then they do not have right to enforce the rights b/c they are not involved in the land anymore – no interest in the land.
  + There are 2 exceptions: (1) government and (2) charities
* **Applying Privity Requirement**
  + **Horizontal privity** between Neponset and Dyers – instantaneous privity (new and adapted form of privity).
  + **Vertical Privity:** The original covenanting parties transferred their interest to the subsequent possessors of the parcel.
    - In this case, Dyers transferring land to other party is vertical privity
    - No real vertical privity b/c Neponset realty never transferred any land to Neponset owner’s association. Therefore, under the old regime, there would NOT be vertical privity to the owner’s association.
    - This court gets around this by saying that we will treat Neponset Owner Association as representatives of the property owners.
  + Vertical privity is being applied in a relaxed modern form. This leads to modern American covenants and organizational systems for communities.
  + \*\*Won’t do “blind adherence to ancient formula”
* **Touch and Concern: “Realism”** In this case, the Court says that payment of fee, while not directly effecting the land, has “a burden upon an interest in land, which on the other hand increases the value of a different interest in the same or related land.”
  + Enjoyment is improved as well as the money is being used for beach and street upkeep which would also raise market value.

Hypothetical case: Developer, O, with 3 plots of land.

* O sells lot 1 to buyer A and includes deed of sale with limiting height of house. In this case A has servient estate and the dominant estate is the remaining land that O owns (lot 2 and 3).
* O sells lot 2 to B with same deed of sale and covenant. Lot 3 is dominant estate which is being benefited by burden on lot 2.
  + B, who now owns lot 2, is also dominant estate over lot 1
* If A sells lot 1 to C with same deed and limit on house.
* If C breaks covenant with huge tower. So is there an Equitable servitude (for injunction) or real covenant (damages)
  + Writing – yes
  + Intent - yes
  + Touch and concern (estate being burdened and an estate benefiting) - yes
  + Horizontal privity – yes
  + Vertical privity – yes
  + Notice (for injunction) - yes
* So B can enforce against C as successive owner of dominant estate.
* Lets say B decides to build a big tower, can A enforce covenant against B? A was owner of servient estate.
  + Writing between O and B? – yes
  + Intent – yes
  + Touch and concern – yes
  + Horizontal privity – yes
  + Vertical privity between O/A and B – no
    - Seems that first buyers CANNOT enforce covenant on later buyers

Concept of implied reciprocal negative servitudes fixes this issue – so earlier buyers CAN enforce covenant on later buyers.

* Reads into any future deed a reciprocal negative servitude 🡪 if you can restrict someone else of something then they can restrict on you.
* **Common plan doctrine** – solves the problem of privity by assuming law will reading into every deed a reciprocal obligation to enforce.
* This leads to suburb growth

### Limiting Covenant

**CHALLENGES TO A COVENANT**

1. Reasonableness and public policy violations (*Davidson* & *Nahrstedt*)
   1. **Public policy** concerns are mostly found when the plaintiffs are seeking **injunctive relief** or when covenants are violating a policy favoring free use of land
   2. Changed circumstances may make the covenant unreasonable and unenforceable.
   3. Rules and bylaws of common interest developments may be reviewed for reasonableness
   4. Various states have different tests:
      1. **NJ (*Davidson*):** add public policy test on top of T&C test.
         1. Concludes that b/c T&C applies covenant should be enforceable, but b/c it is not in Public policy, remedy should be damages and NOT injunction 🡪 On remand lower court invalidated covenant completely
      2. **Cali (*Nahrstedt*):** “cloaks all covenants with a STRONG PRESUMPTION of validity”
      3. **Third Restatement**: presumes covenants are valid unless they are “illegal ir unconditional or violate public policy”
2. Constitutional violations (*Shelley v. Kraemer*)
   1. *Buchanan v. Warley* (1917): Racially restrictive ZONING unconstitutional, but covenants were not until later and FHA actually encouraged them until the 1960s when FHA of 1968 outlawed them.
   2. **Third Restatement:** If a covenant would be unenforceable by state court, it is also invalid before enforcement as a matter of public policy.
   3. Outside of racial discrimination, state action is usually NOT found in enforcing covenants (first amendment examples with free speech – p. 636)
3. Claims of discrimination under the FHA
4. Restrictions on Alienability (*Serio, Woodside***)**
5. Unreasonable restraint of trade (due to concerns of monopoly)

***Davidson v. D. Katz & Sons* (NJ 1990): ANTI-COMPETITIVE COVENANTS; LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS**

* Facts: Davidson owned a supermarket, sold nearby one to Katz with covenant to not have a supermarket there for another 40 years. Katz sold it to New Brunswick Housing Authority who leases it to C-Town to open a new supermarket. Davidson sued Katz, NBHA, and C-Town to enforce covenant in the deed to Katz.
  + Valid Covenant? (1)Was In writing; (2) there was intent; (3) there was vertical privity (This is instantaneous privity and NOT strict privity b/c lease); (4) touch and concern (burden and benefit) isn’t clear but likely was b/c it burdens one property and benefits a different supermarket property.
  + (5) Notice (for injunction)? Yes b/c it was deed of sale.
* Holding: Under NJ reasonableness test, a covenant is unenforceable if it unreasonable in light of **public interest**. NJ has abandoned the rigid “touch and concern” doctrine governing covenants. Instead, there are eight factors that must be considered. Here, covenant is contrary to public interest/policy goal (rehabilitation of urban cities) → unreasonable → unenforceable.
* 8 factors test laid out in cases:

1. Parties’ intent when they executed the covenant, and whether the intent did not interfere with existing commercial laws like antitrust laws or **public policy**
2. Whether the covenant **impacted the** **consideration for the conveyance**, which would provide a measure of the value of the covenant to parties at the time
3. **Clarity** of the covenant’s restriction
4. Whether the covenant is in a recorded WRITING and the subsequent taker had NOTICE
5. Whether the covenant is for a **reasonable duration** and area
   1. perpetuity may often be unreasonable
6. The extent to which the covenant unreasonably restrains trade or secures monopoly for covenantor
7. Whether the covenant is inconsistent with the **public interest**
8. Whether changed circumstances since the covenant’s execution have made the covenant unreasonable.

**California Davis-Stirling Act (1970’s)** – Restrictions in covenants “should be enforced unless they are wholly arbitrary, violate a fundamental public policy, or impose a burden on the use of affected land that far outweighs any benefit.

***Nahrstedt v. Lakeside Village* (Cal. 1994): COVENANT AS PART OF BY-LAW**

* Facts: Nahrstedt purchased a unit in the Lakeside Village Condominiums and moved in with her three cats. When the Homeowners’ Association learned of the cats, it demanded their removal. Nahrstedt sued the Association, arguing that the restriction was unreasonable as applied to her cats, which were kept indoors and not free to roam any common areas.
* Holding: Must comply with covenant; NOT unreasonable and does not violate public policy. Common interest development rules generally are given a presumption of validity and will be enforced unless unreasonable, or if they are unconstitutional or against public policy (attract buyers looking for stable environment; promotes predictability).
  + Test/reasonableness is based on California Davis-Stirling Act (1970’s)
* Dissent, Arabian: Covenant is arbitrary, unreasonable. The undue burden on the use of owners who can maintain pets without creating a nuisance substantially outweighs whatever utility the restriction serves in abstract. Majority ignores the fact that the covenant burden is restricted to the unit owner’s interior space and does not impact the common space in any way. Owning pets that does NOT disturb the quiet enjoyment of other owners’ property serves no discernible benefit to the common interest development.

***Neuman v. Grandview* (Fla. 2003): COVENANT AS PART OF DECLARATION**

* Facts: Grandview operates a condominium complex in Florida. Neuman is one of a group of residents at Grandview who reserved the auditorium to conduct a religious service. Other residents complained to management about the holding of a religious service in a common area. After a heated, argumentative resident meeting, 70 percent of residents voted in favor of prohibiting religious services, so Grandview enacted a rule that prohibited the use of the auditorium for religious services.
* Holding: Grandview HAS the authority to enact a rule reasonably restricting use of its auditorium.
  + The rule specifically prohibiting religious services in its auditorium is reasonable in light of Grandview’s concern that, based on the contentious condominium-wide meeting, serious conflict could arise between competing religious groups if services were not prohibited.
  + The right to peaceably assemble that Neuman claims has generally applied to the right to discuss government and politics and NOT religion.
* Rule: Rules in a declaration of condominium are valid if reasonable and don’t violate public policy or owners’ constitutional rights.

**For Final: KNOW BOTH TRADITIONAL TESTS AND 3RD RESTATEMENT**

![](data:image/png;base64...)

***Northwest v. Serio* (Md. 1929): RULE AGAINST RESTRAINTS ON ALIENATION**

* Facts: Northwest conveyed land to the grantee in fee simple, with a provision that grantees could not sell the property for a certain period of time without Northwest’s consent. Subsequently, grantees contracted to sell the lot to Serios. When Northwest did not consent to the sale, Serios brought suit for specific performance of their sale agreement on the grounds that the grantor consent clause in the original deed was invalid.
  + Serio would argue that fee simple should grant them full ownership and determining who they can sell to is invasion of their rights
* Holding: Grantor consent clauses in deeds are generally void as invalid restraints against alienation.
  + The clause in the deed from Northwest that prohibited the grantees from selling the property for a certain period of time without Northwest’s consent is INVALID because it improperly restricts the transferability of the property.
* **Dissent**: The purpose of the grantor consent clause in the deed is to give Northwest the power to control the character of its development for a certain period of time. This is reasonable in light of developer’s interest in securing a return on its investment and the public’s interest in allowing venture capitalist developers such as Northwest to commonly develop a residential area.
* Rule: A clause in a fee simple deed requiring grantor consent to transfer the property is generally invalid as repugnant to the estate.

***Woodside Village v. Jahren* (Fla. 2002): RULE AGAINST RESTRAINTS ON ALIENATION**

* Facts: Woodside Village is a condo development governed by the Declaration of Condominium of Woodside Village. Declaration contained restrictions on leases, as well as a provision allowing amendment of Declaration, and was amended to further inhibit leases, limiting them to no more than 9 months. Condo owners in Woodside all purchased their condos subject to the Declaration and as a result, notice that the Declaration was subject to amendment. Year after the amendment passed, Jahren was engaged in a lease for more than nine months, but did NOT terminate it when notified that he was required to comply with amendment.
* Holding: The amendment is VALID and ENFORCEABLE, in line with historical treatment of condo restrictions. Jahren was on **notice that Declaration could be amended at any time** and that he would be subject to such amendments; the amendment is not arbitrary, furthers Woodside’s desire for stability in the community and continuity of residence.
* Concurrence: The majority was correct in its findings that the amendment is valid. However, the amendment has deprived Jahren of a strong benefit in his property that existed when he purchased it. The Legislature should consider placing restrictions on condominiums’ ability to change the rights of existing unit owners by amending their bylaws.
* Rule: Amendments to a declaration of condominium are valid if they are reasonable and do not violate public policy or the condo owners’ constitutional rights.
* Importance: Condos are essentially different from other forms of property (live in close proximity, common facilities, have form of governance that is essentially a “democratic sub-society.”), and are thus generally entitled to a greater degree of control over the condo owners’ property uses.

Notes: Legislature later overruled *Woodside* to say that amendments to a declaration do not restrain buyers who purchase condominium before the amendment passes

* Differentiating this from *Serio* – In Serio there was a restriction on complete alienation, while here it is a limit on leasing.

***Shelley v. Kramer* (1948): RULE AGAINST RACIAL RESTRICTIONS**

* Facts: In 1911, 30 property owners on a Missouri street signed/recorded a restrictive covenant, providing that no races other than Caucasians allowed as tenants on property for next 50 yrs. In 1945, Shelleys (black) bought a house on one of the restricted parcels without knowledge of restrictive covenant. Kraemers + other white property owners brought suit to enforce covenant, seeking to enjoin Shelleys from taking possession and divest them of title.
  + Case was consolidated with similar Michigan case before Supreme Court, here determining whether Equal Protection Clause prohibits a state's courts from enforcing racially restrictive covenants.
* Holding: Agreements alone cannot be regarded as violation of 14th A rights because no state action. However, court enforcement of the covenant constituted a state action to deprive petitioners of 14th A rights. [The issue here is whether state court enforcement of racially restrictive covenants entered into by private actors constitutes state action. 14th A does not apply to purely private discrimination, so people are free to enter into/voluntarily abide by racially restrictive covenants. Nevertheless, the actions of state courts are state actions within meaning of 14th A. States may NOT make available the full coercive power of government to allow private individuals to deny the Shelleys’ rights on the basis of race. Judicial enforcement of the racially restrictive covenants violated the Equal Protection Clause, so the rulings of the state courts are reversed.]
* Rule: State court enforcement of racially restrictive covenants constitutes state action, which violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (which guarantees equal treatment of all people under the law, including in their exercise of various property rights). Restrictive covenants that discriminate solely on the basis of race would be invalid on equal protection grounds if created by a state or local law.

Notes:

* Similar to *Marsh v. Alabama* in that non-state actors are found to be violating state action in a sense.

### The Law of Covenants: A Review & Conclusion

If we take the material and align them chronologically we see two main ideas:

* + 1. Rapid immigration in late 1800s and early 1900s
    2. The great migrations when black left Jim Crow south for north and west.

Lawyers arguing against Jim Crow argued that these laws were just reinstituting slavery, and that any zoning/segregation was just to keep white power. There was also violence in the south.

In 1882 Congress passed Chinese Exclusionary Act

* In 1886 California *Yick Wo v. Hopkins* (1886) held that a discriminatory enforcement of municipal ordinances against Chinese applicants was unconstitutional.
* Racially exclusive zoning ordinance in Baltimore – struck down in *Buchanan*

At the time of *Shelley v. Kraemer* (1948) racially restrictive covenants were extremely common. Loren Miller and Thurgood Marshall at helm of putting together arguments against these racially restrictive covenants.

* Could have challenged based on notice, touch and concern (have to assume that property price would go down if allowed blacks to move in), notice, and restrains against alienation (denying right to sell to a certain race). But rather challenged on civil right and constitutional rights.

**For constitutional violation need (1) state action and (2) discrimination**

1. **Defining state action**: the court order enforcement is state action.
   1. State action is “But for cause” b/c have 2 willing parties and state prevented it with court order.
   2. Also, can define state action as a whole host of decisions where state common law doctrine is upholding racially restrictive covenants.
      1. Cumulative force of decisions of the state which led to this
   3. Third version of state action theory is that any time you have any action at all, you have state action.
      1. Issue with this is that it kind of eviscerated the distinction between private agreements and public law
2. **Defining Discrimination:** the court doesn’t clearly define what their view is. Two options…
   1. Disparate treatment
   2. Disparate impact

## Regulating the Right to Use through Regulatory Law

### Zoning

**CASES**: *Village of Euclid v. Ambler* (1926), *Village of Belle Terre v. Borass* (1974), *Moore v. City of East Cleveland* (1977)

Zoning serves same function as nuisance law: Limits harms that might arise from the proximity of incompatible land uses. Zoning ordinances are a relatively recent development of 1920’s, created to deal with the difficulties created by increasing urban populations. Constitutional doctrine framework evolves from 1920’s (*Euclid*) to 1970’s.

* Power to pass zoning regulations derives from states’ police powers.

**Use/Euclidean Zoning** (*Euclid*) – Usually cumulative/pyramidal structure (residential may be built in industrial or commercial, but not industrial or commercial in residential.)

**Area Zoning** – Regulates size of lot, height of building, setbacks, etc.

**Subdivision Regulation** – Developers go through regulatory process/site plan review.

**Traditional Zoning v. New Urbanism** – Critics say traditional zoning favors suburban sprawl. New urbanism promotes mixed-use communities favoring walkability/transit/integration of multiple land uses in one space.

TEST FOR ZONING (*Belle Terre* Marshall Dissent Minority Test)

1. **Due Process**: Is there a fundamental right protected by the 14th Amendment which has been violated?
   1. If yes, triggers strict scrutiny of Powell’s *Moore* view.
   2. If no, enter *Euclid* world. **Rational basis review**: Fairly debatable that reasonably related to gov interest?
      1. (Only one case has ever not met this test.)
2. **Strict Scrutiny**: Is the ordinance absolutely necessary to protect a compelling and substantial government interest?

If no, ordinance unconstitutional. If yes, constitutional.

**WAYS TO CHALLENGE EXCLUSIONARY ZONING ORDINANCES**

1. **U.S. Constitutional Challenges**
   1. Economic Loss – Takings or Substantive Due Process (*Euclid*)
   2. Fundamental Right – Equal Protection Clause (*Belle Terre*)
      1. *Belle Terre* Dissent Test – Fundamental right violated? No – Deference. Yes – Look to less restrictive alternatives.
   3. Fundamental Right – Substantive Due Process (*Moore v. East Cleveland*)
2. **State Procedural/Common Law Challenges**
   1. Can go further in protecting certain private rights of association, etc.
   2. Prior non-conforming use (*Parrillo’s*)
   3. Vested Rights (*Stone*)
   4. Contract Zoning (*Durand*)
3. **Fair Housing Act (1968)**
   1. ***Disparate Treatment Claims***: To make a Prima Facie case, have to show that animus against group was “significant factor” in zoning. To establish this, P does **NOT** need to show overtly race-based bias. Rather, the considerable impact that the zoning decision had on minorities in the community.
      1. Burden then shifts back to D who would have to show thar there was a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for action.
      2. If D meets burden, P must prove that the D intentionally discriminated against them on prohibited grounds
         1. Would the D have taken the same action solely on the basis of its purported legitimate reasons for rezoning?
         2. Is there evidence to show that the legitimate reasons were de minimus? If NO then P establishes discrimination vel non (*MHANY*)
   2. ***Disparate impact claim***: (segregation in town under Huntington, or (if rule available), inclusionary zoning within town required under Mt. Laurel).
   3. Some state statutes go further than FHA and bar discrimination on other grounds (sexual orientation, etc.)
   4. Discriminatory Impact Rule (*ICP; MHANY*)
4. **State Constitutional Challenges**
   1. The Mount Laurel Doctrine
      1. **Bright line rule approach**: Fiscal policy alone is NOT a valid reason to zone only for single family houses.
      2. **Standard approach:** municipalities must make a realistic effort to provide affordable houses. *“realistically possible”*
5. Civil Rights Act of 1866: Corollary
   1. May also apply to housing under §1982, but only applies to race, and only offers damages (no injunctive relief)

**PRINCIPLES: STATE POLICE POWER & GENERAL WELFARE**

1. Land use regulation is encompassed within the state’s police power
2. The state police power MUST promote public health safety, morals, or the general welfare
3. As a delegation of the state police power, the exercise of land use regulation must recognize and serve the general welfare of the state’s citizens
4. Proper provision for adequate housing of all categories of people is an absolute essential in promotion of the general welfare (*Mt Laurel*)
5. The universal and constant need for housing is so important and of such broad public interest that the general welfare which municipalities must consider extends beyond their boundaries (**moral hazard argument-below**)
6. It has to follow that, the presumptive obligation arises for each such municipality affirmatively to plan and provide, by its land use regulations, the reasonable opportunity for an appropriate variety and choice of housing; negatively, it may not adopt regulations or policies which thwart or preclude that opportunity.

***Village of Euclid v. Ambler* (1926): ESTABLISHES EUCLIDEAN ZONING AS CONSTITUTIONAL**

* Facts: Ambler Realty owned land in Village of Euclid, a largely residential suburb of Cleveland. In 1922, Euclid enacted comprehensive zoning ordinances (concerned that urban environment would keep expanding into suburb; suburb wants to preserve residential character) and created a board of zoning appeals charged with enforcement. The regulations created different districts based on the class of use, including purely residential, mixed use, commercial, and industrial and partitioned Amber’s land in terms of uses permissible on it (notably, portions zoned prohibiting development of industry.)
  + Ambler alleged the zoning ordinance violated the 14th Amendment and Ohio Constitution by **depriving Ambler of liberty and property without due process.**
  + Specifically, Ambler argued that the ordinance reduced the land’s value by 75% and deterred potential buyers.
* Holding: The zoning restriction scheme here may well prove to be unconstitutional as applied, but it is **constitutional on its face**.
  + J. Southerland’s looks to common law of nuisance as means to solve urban life. Can think of zoning as replacing the law of nuisance.
  + Court says that this is a VALID exercise of police power.
  + Court explains that important to have apt and houses separate for kids sake, but it is unclear why apt living is bad for kids.
* Rule: Municipal zoning regulations are constitutional (even when substantially diminishes property values and separates people with discriminatory effect), unless arbitrary and unreasonable with no substantial relation to public health, safety, morals or general welfare.
  + (Even thin rationale is sufficient; just claim the measure somehow benefits community policy goal.)
* Euclid is the landmark case in zoning law which determines that zoning ordinances will be given deference by the court.

***Village of Belle Terre v. Borass* (1974): SINGLE-FAMILY ZONING CONSTITUTIONAL; MARSHALL DISSENT**

* Facts: Dickmans owned a house in Belle Terre, leased to 6 students of nearby university. Belle Terre had zoning ordinance which restricted land use to one-family dwellings.
  + Defines “family” being defined as persons related by blood, adoption, or marriage, or two unmarried cohabitating people.
  + Belle Terre cited violation of this ordinance b/c the students were not a “family” (none related by blood, adoption, marriage). Dickmans and tenants brought suit alleging that the ordinance violated their equal protection rights.
  + Whole slew of complaints: interfering with right to travel, right to privacy, making unnecessary distinction between married v. unmarried, and there is no rational basis.
* Holding, Douglas: Ordinance is constitutionally permissible.
* \*\*No constitutionally-protected interest (fundamental right) was implicated by the regulation and rational basis test applies.
  + The ordinance does NOT prohibit racial minorities from living within the city. The ordinance also does not burden fundamental rights such as the right to vote, the right of association, the right of access to the courts, or any right of privacy.
  + The definition of “family” is an exercise of **legislative discretion** and is outside the realm of judicial second-guessing.
* *Euclid*: Violates 14th Amendment only if unreasonable + arbitrary. Ordinance here not arbitrary b/c was designed to reduce noises/traffic, provide quiet/open spaces for children to play.
* Dissent, Marshall: **Minority Rule:** “It can withstand constitutional scrutiny only upon a clear showing that the burden imposed is necessary to protect a compelling and substantial government interest.”
  + If town could achieve same goal via ordinance that does NOT discriminate constitutionally protected lifestyle choices then unconstitutional.
  + Village’s ordinance violates freedom of association (right to establish a home under 14th Amendment) + right to privacy (discriminates on the basis of personal lifestyle) 🡪 both fundamental rights
  + Ordinance is NOT narrowly tailored. The burden imposed by the ordinance is both overinclusive and underinclusive with respect to stated goals (controlling population density; preventing noise, traffic, and parking problems; and maintaining reasonable rental controls): Permits a “family” of twenty to live in one house so long as they were all related by blood, marriage, or adoption, but would not permit a much smaller group of persons to share a house simply because they are not so related.
* Importance: Fundamental right test for zoning constitutionality in Marshall Dissent. Majority maintains deferential *Euclid* standard.
  + Some state courts have held that their State constitutions prevents barring definitions for families (*Dinolfo*)

***Moore v. City of East Cleveland* (1977): FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TEST FOR CONSTITUTIONALITY**

* Facts: City of East Cleveland enacted a housing ordinance that limited the occupancy of a dwelling unit to members of a single family. The ordinance narrowly defined the term “family” as encompassing only a few categories of related individuals. Moore lived in a home with her son and two grandsons, outside housing ordinance’s legal definition of “family.” Moore refused to modify her living arrangement and was charged with criminal penalties, convicted, and sentenced to a fine and five days in jail.
* Holding, Powell (plurality): ***Belle Terre* Test:** Ordinance violates fundamental right. Legitimate government interests here, but there are less restrictive means that gov could use, so ordinance NOT necessary.
* CEC argued that its housing ordinance should be sustained based on *Belle Terre.* However, this case is distinguishable from *Belle Terre* b/c the CEC ordinance limits blood relatives from living together (breaking up the sanctity of a family).
  + Intrusive regulation of family that **examined under strict scrutiny**.
* Govt objectives (preventing overcrowding, minimizing traffic, not financially burdening school system) only marginally served by ordinance, which is NOT necessary to accomplishment
* Brennan/Marshall: Talks about how this ordinance implicates racial injustices b/c ordinance is imputing a model for suburb living which are not as common amongst black families.
* **Dissent,** Stewart/Rehnquist: The ordinance should be upheld as a constitutional restriction on a NON-fundamental right.
* **Dissen**t, White: More deferential, like *Euclid.* Ordinance did not violate fundamental liberty interests, b/c does not totally foreclose the possibility of this family living arrangement.
  + Still permits her to live with grandchildren elsewhere in Cleveland metropolitan area.
* Rule: The right of related family members to live together is protected by the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, and necessarily encompasses a broader definition of “family” than just members of the nuclear family.

### Pre-Existing Rights & Particularized Zoning

**CASES**: *Town of Belleville v. Parrillo’s Inc.* (N.J. 1980), *Stone v. City of Wilton* (Iowa, 1983), *Durand v. IDC Bellingham* (Mass. 2003)

***Town of Belleville v. Parrillo’s* (NJ 1980): PRIOR NONCONFORMING USE**

* Facts: Parrillo’s operated as a restaurant in Belleville, which subsequently enacted zoning ordinances itemizing permitted uses for each zone. Operating a restaurant was NOT permitted under the new zoning laws. But b/c operated as restaurant prior to enactment, permitted to continue because of its preexisting nonconforming use. However, some years later, Parrillo’s ceased its primary operation as a restaurant and began operating as a discotheque, which was also NOT permitted under the new zoning regulations. Fined for $250.
  + Belleville claims that disco is NOT substantially like restaurant
  + Parillo’s argument would be that the NJ statue does not say anything about the new use being “substantially similar” to the old one.
* Holding: A substantial change CANNOT be upheld as a preexisting nonconforming use; needs to be substantially same kind of use. Presumption against allowing an existing nonconforming use to continue if there is doubt.
  + Here: several significant changes after switch to discotheque, including: a reduction in tables, a change in lighting, an addition of loud music, and dancing replacing eating as the primary activity.
  + Public Policy/general welfare of community wins out over autonomy of the owners 🡪 also, a nuisance here.
* Rule: An existing nonconforming use will be permitted to continue, ONLY IF it is a continuance of substantially the same kind devoted at the time of the passage of the zoning ordinance.

Notes:

* Many states require nonconforming use to be phased out over time through **amortization**
* Under many zoning ordinances, if non-conforming use is abandoned or discontinued status is lost

***Stone v. City of Wilton* (Iowa, 1983): VESTED RIGHTS CLAIMS**

* Facts: Stones bought an undeveloped parcel of land with plans to build a multi-family housing project. They paid architecture and engineering fees and secured a loan for construction. Before the start of construction, City of Wilton rezoned the land to only permit single-family residences b/c of insufficient sewage, water, and electric services. Seek invalidation of rezoning their property.
* Holding: For a property owner to have a vested right in a zoning classification, the owner must have made substantial efforts under the classification toward accomplishing the proposed project. Stones’ efforts too preliminary, not so substantial as to create vested rights.
  + Landowner paying for architectural and engineering services and devising a construction plan do NOT constitute a substantial enough effort.
  + Weaknesses: maybe too much deference here? Timing suspicious?

**Rezoning**:

* Many states require rezoning to accord with comprehensive plan and for decisions to be made with long-range view
* Some states don’t require consistency

***Durand v. IDC Bellingham* (Mass. 2003): CONTRACT ZONING CLAIMS**

* Facts: Town wanted to increase its property tax base by industrializing an area. Picked area zoned for agricultural use that was next to an area zoned for industrial use as the place they should change. IDC Bellingham wanted to build power plant there and needed town to rezone, so agreed to make an **$8 million gift** to town if it voted to rezone. Town voted in favor of rezoning. Residents who owned nearby land sued claimed rezoning was void b/c it constituted **illegal contract zoning**.
* Holding: When someone offers money in exchange for the promise to vote for rezoning, it’s considered contract zoning which is invalid, but here NO promise was made contingent upon the money where the board promised to vote one way or the other. Thus, b/c the agreement does NOT invalidate the vote & the rezoning was valid (not arbitrary or unreasonable), does not violate any law.
  + Possible issue with majority is that it opens up the possibility for corruption.
  + Strong presumption of validity
* Dissent: The agreement between IDC and Bellingham constitutes illegal contract zoning. The town agreed to exercise its police power to rezone the parcel of land in exchange for a promise of $8 million. This payment was unrelated to any aspect of the proposed development and therefore was not a lawful basis for the town’s vote.
  + **Doctrine of extraneous conditions:** IF the offer is NOT related to (1) ANY aspect of the proposed development OR (2) any public need arising out of the zoning change, then NOT a legitimate basis for the vote.
* Rule: An agreement including a voluntary offer of public benefits in exchange for a vote in favor of rezoning a parcel of land does NOT, standing alone, invalidate the legislative decision by the town to rezone if the agreement was consummated after the vote took place. A zoning by law will NOT be held invalid unless there is a demonstration by preponderance of evidence that the zoning regulation is arbitrary or unreasonable. The motives for granting a zoning bylaw does not affect the analysis of whether a zoning bylaw is valid.

Notes:

* Spot zoning (p. 453),

### Exclusionary Zoning and Fair Housing Law

**CASES**: *NAACP v. Mount Laure*l (N.J. 1975), *MHANY v. Nassau Count*y (2d Cir. 2016), Oakland v. Wells Fargo (2020)

**KEY PROVISIONS OF THE FAIR HOUSING ACT**

1. §3604: Unlawful to:
   1. **(a) To refuse to sell or rent** after the making of a bona fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of **race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin**.
   2. **(b)** To discriminate against any person in the **terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental** of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of **race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin**.
   3. **(c) To make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin, or an intention to make any such preference, limitation, or discrimination.**
      1. Difficult to enforce against discriminatory advertising in internet age.
   4. **(d)** To **represent** to any person because of **race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin** that any dwelling is **not available** for inspection, sale, or rental when such dwelling is in fact so available.
   5. **(e)** For profit, to induce or attempt to induce any person to sell or rent any dwelling by **representations regarding the entry or prospective entry** into the neighborhood of a person or persons of a particular **race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin**
2. §3605: Discrimination in residential real estate-related transactions
   1. (a) unlawful for any person/entity whose business includes residential real estate to discriminate against any person in making available transaction.
3. §3607: Exemptions
   1. (a) Religious organizations and private clubs.

**Limits of FHA**

1. FHA would NOT apply if you decided to sell house without agent/advertisement.
2. Does NOT apply to shopping centers, b/c NOT a dwelling. ONLY cover housing.
   1. Public accommodations claim would protect shopping centers. But process for proving it is different and scope of protection is more narrow.
3. Discrimination based on sexuality is NOT protected
4. FHA covers sex discrimination and ad discrimination 🡪 can’t limit search by race/sex but can’t say what race/sex you are
   1. Could say that this is disparate impact
5. No enforcement by AG (§3613: Enforcement by private persons)

**HUD (Housing and Urban Development) REGULATIONS**

1. Prohibit blanket prohibitions against those with criminal records. May violate FHA if landlord has policy prohibiting rentals to those with criminal records
   1. Under **disparate impact theory**, may violate 3604(a), which covers race, because disproportionate number of people with criminal convictions are racial minorities.
      1. Operative language in 3604(a): **“otherwise make unavailable.”**

**COROLLLARY—CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1866**

1. May also apply to housing under §1982, but only applies to race, and only offers **damages** (no injunctive relief)
2. Some state statutes go further than FHA and bar discrimination on other grounds (sexual orientation, etc.)

**REMEDIES** – injunctive relief, compensatory damages, punitive damages

1. You can also file a complaint with HUD, which will investigate the matter. If HUD finds reasonable cause to believe a violation of the law has occurred, it must issue a “charge” on behalf of the aggrieved person.
2. Critiques of the remedies:
   1. Racial discrimination remains at extremely high levels, particularly in terms of the number of units shown to minority renters and home buyers
   2. \*Many victims fail to report violations or pursue claims
   3. The delay and expense of litigation undermines the deterrent value of the FHA
   4. Problem with the goal of finding intent - most discrimination may be the result of unconscious bias by landlords who do not see themselves as prejudiced.

**Disparate Treatment/Intent Test**

1. Plaintiff makes *prima facie* case for discrimination based on a protected category. Must show that **hostility towards** protected class was a “significant factor” in housing/zoning decision.
   1. To establish P does NOT need to show an overtly race-based bias. But can use:
      1. Sequence of events involved in Board’s zoning process
      2. Considerable impact that the zoning decision would have on minorities
   2. If court agrees, then burden is shifted to D.
2. Defendant rebuts prima facie case by demonstrating that the decision/policy was necessary to achieve a legitimate, nondiscriminatory governmental interest.
3. Plaintiff must prove that the government intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff based on a prohibited category.

**Disparate Impact Test: HUD’s 2013 Rule**

1. Plaintiff makes *prima facie* case for discrimination based on a protected category. Must demonstrate the existence of a facially neutral practice with a significantly **disproportionate impact** on a particular type of people.
   1. Predictably results in a disparate impact on a group of persons OR creates, increases, reinforces, or perpetuates segregated housing patterns because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.
   2. Case **can** be substantiated by statistical evidence or tendency to perpetuate segregation; relative % of people in each group affected, rather than absolute numbers.
2. Defendant rebuts prima facie case by demonstrating that the decision/policy was necessary to achieve a legitimate, nondiscriminatory governmental interest.
3. Pursuant to HUD Rule 1074, the plaintiff must show that the government’s interest could have been achieved by less discriminatory means.

***NAACP v. Township of Mount Laurel* (NJ 1975): HUD MUST TAKE AFFIRMATIVE STEPS TO DESEGREGATE**

* Facts: Under Mount Laurel’s zoning regulations, much land was zoned exclusively for industry (but only a tiny fraction of that was actually used for industrial purposes; rest was left undeveloped). Because of town’s need to cover the high costs of schools, it sought primarily buildings with high tax rates (industrial buildings and expensive homes).
  + NJ tax structure: Low density housing with fewer children → good ratables (bc use that generates taxes, with less demand for services). Lower property density → higher property values (same reasoning in *Euclid*.) NAACP brought suit claiming that the combined land use regulations unlawfully exclude low/moderate-income families from the town.
  + P might argue that this zoning law is NOT in general welfare/public policy or that there is a vested rights argument (the community had been here for a long time prior to new zoning ordinance)
  + Court says that there is rising demand for housing, and there needs to be affordable housing.
* Holding: Regulations are unlawful. Zoning regulations must promote the general welfare and this does NOT.
  + Court rules based on state constitution as opposed to federal const. Reasons:
    - Can’t be overturned by SC
    - *Euclid* sets up a differential stance to local authorities so the federal court might agree with municipality
* Importance: Reading case at its most extreme: every NJ resident has a right to housing.
* Rule: A municipal town must provide opportunity for low/moderate-income families to live in town (through enactment of land use regulations), and may not constructively prevent low/moderate-income families from living in town.
  + **Bright line rule approach**: Fiscal policy *alone* is NOT a valid reason to zone only for single family houses.
  + **Standard approach:** municipalities must make a realistic effort to provide affordable houses. “realistically possible”

Note:

* **Tragedy of the commons**: Almost everyone will act in their selfish interest and try to keep out people not acting in favor of the tax base. If town’s justification was permissible, no town would provide housing to lower income people.
* Impact of decision was uneven at best and remains so.

Question from this is whether the courts can really enforce this.

* **Mount Laurel is a minority rule,** but Mass., Cali., and Oregon all have legislation limiting exclusionary zoning
* There is still a housing crisis in the US for affordable housing.

Mount Lauren responded to this by basically ignoring this ruling and have new case in **Mount Lauren 2** in 1985.

* Extends Mount Laurel to cover every municipality, i.e. not simply developing communities
* Authorizes appointment of three regional trial judges to handle all cases;
* Allows courts to order government subsidies for private developers to set aside a portion of developments for low and moderate income residents
* \*\*Authorizes a “builder’s remedy,” allows courts to order a municipality to allow a developer to construct a particular project
* Allows a special master to be appointed to rewrite the zoning ordinance

***Texas Dept. of Housing & Community Affairs v. ICP* (2015):**

* Facts: HUD regulations prohibit blanket prohibitions against those with criminal records. May violate FHA if landlord has policy prohibiting rentals to those with criminal records. Under **Disparate Impact Theory**, may violate 3604(a) (which covers race), because disproportionate number of people with criminal convictions are racial minorities.
* Holding: The statutory language of FHA focuses on the consequences of the actions rather than the actor’s intent; FHA “because of race” does not require a showing of intentional discrimination.
* Importance: First case to show that disparate impact claims are cognizable under FHA.
* Rule: FHA prohibits entities from making housing decisions that have a disparate impact on a protected class, even if this impact is not intended. Claim for disparate impact must meet a robust causality requirement; mere evidence of racial disparity is insufficient.

***MHANY v. County of Nassau* (2nd Cir. 2016): INTEGRATION UNDER FHA**

* Facts: Garden City had no affordable housing and a relatively low minority population. Nassau County put two properties up for sale and proposed to zone them as multi-family residential group (R-M). Residents objected (concerns about increased traffic, desire to retain the “character” of single-family housing, consequences of introducing affordable housing). So City adopted new zoning category of residential-townhouse (R-T). County solicited proposals to purchase the properties. MHANY concluded that given the minimum bid, it would be financially impossible to build affordable housing on R-T land. Land sold to other company. MHANY prepared proposals of what it could have provided under R-M zoning, each containing at least 15 percent affordable housing.
  + Alleged County’s change to R-T zoning violated FHA, b/c it effectuated disparate treatment and disparately impacted minorities.
* Holding: Disparate Treatment: Nassau County violated the FHA by rejecting the R-M zoning proposal. Discriminatory effect (dearth of minorities and affordable housing deprived, discriminatory intent (racial animus). By extension, Garden City had been driven by discriminatory intent.
  + Disparate Impact: District court incorrectly applied circuit case law instead of HUD regulation.
  + For disparate impact, pursuant to a Housing and Urban Development (HUD) regulation, the plaintiff must show that the government’s interest could have been achieved by less discriminatory means
  + Even though the residents did not implicate race directly in objecting to R-M zoning, the **circumstantial evidence of race-based animus was sufficient to support the court’s finding of discriminatory intent**
* Importance: FHA prohibits housing practices and zoning restrictions with **discriminatory intent** OR **disparate impact** on minorities.

**RECIPROCITY OF ADVANTAGE:** Idea behind takings clause is that the government may not force some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole. If burden on *all*, then not a taking.

**SCENARIOS FOR A TAKING UNDER 5TH AMENDMENT**

1. Eminent domain

* Taking of the private property must be “for public use” and in exchange for “just compensation”)
* “Just compensation” = Fair market value; generally the amount the property would likely sell for on open market

1. Physical occupation
2. Regulatory taking

**Competing tests for public us requirement (*Kelo*)**

1. Public purpose (*Kelo* majority)
2. Truly Public purpose (Kennedy concurrence – heightened review)
   1. Arizona, Montana, Penn.
3. Prevention of social harm (O’Connor)
   1. Colo., NJ, Ohio
4. Public Ownership or Public Access (Thomas)
   1. Washington State
5. Public necessity + public oversight + independent public significance (**Michigan**)

### Regulatory Takings

Dealing with whether or not there has been a “taking” (eminent domain delt with whether there was public use)

**Three Themes:**

1. Should Holmes opinion in Penn Coal be read as Threshold or Balancing test (TAKING)
   1. “The general rule at least is that while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes TOO FAR it will be recognized as a taking
   2. Balancing Test: (1) extend of the diminution of the value of property; (2) Nature of the public interest served by the legislatures
2. Is there a meaningful distinction between legislation that prevents public harm ad legislation that purchases a public benefit?
   1. O’Connor seems to think so
3. How should we define the unit of analysis for determining how much private property has been taken? That is, how should we define the property interest being regulated?

*Penn Central* Ad Hoc Test to Determine if there is a Regulatory Taking that Requires Compensation – 3 Factor:

1. **The economic impact of the regulation on the particular owner (diminution of value)**
   1. Diminution in value alone is not enough to demonstrate a taking (*Euclid*)
   2. What is the denominator – the hypothetical value at which to compare resulting damage (*Penn Coal)*?
2. **The protection of reasonable or distinct investment-backed expectations**
   1. Opportunity cost of forgone development not a frustration of an investor-backed expectation. More likely to satisfy this prong if it can be shown that an investment has already been made in reasonable reliance on existing statutory or regulatory regime (*Penn Central)*
3. **The character of the governmental action**
   1. Adjusting the benefits/burdens of economic life justified if common good overall is promoted; courts deferential on government judgments as to what promotes welfare *(Penn Central)*
   2. Whether law legitimately prevents an owner from harming others by imposing negative externalities on neighbors or the community or is illegitimately requiring the owner to contribute a benefit…whether the law imposes a disparate impact on a few owners or constitutes a legitimate general regulatory law affecting a class of property that is appropriately subject to restrictions.
   3. Owners have no vested rights to destroy the environment or pollute.
   4. *Penn Coal* (dissent): “Government could hardly go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such charge in the general law.”
4. **(Qualitative considerations**:)
   1. **Magnitude of harm** – equivalent to an actual physical taking**; diminution of value**
   2. **Balance public interest against private harm** – not simply diminution to private owner, but extent to which the public interest demands such a diminution. **Reciprocity of advantage:** Certain regulations, however onerous, provide implicit compensation that mitigates the unfairness of not directly compensating owners.
   3. **Is it fair to concentrate harms as opposed to asking general public to bear burden?**

**Unit of Analysis from Penn Central:**

1. Unit as a whole (not split into building and air rights)
2. Measure regulating properties compared to non-regulated properties OR part of class of properties which are regulate (landmark designated buildings)
   1. Brennan opts for latter

### Per Se Takings- Attempt to write Brightline Rules

1. Any permanent physical invasion of property constitutes a taking *(PrueYard, Loretto)*
2. A complete deprivation of all economically viable use of property interest constitutes a taking, unless background principles of nuisance and property law independently restrict the owner’s intended use of the property (*Lucas*)
3. Right to exclude arbitrarily exists, even where a business is open to the public. But statutes may take basis for exclusion off the table – this does not constitute a taking *(PruneYard)*

Lawyers will often try to get into this category b/c Penn Central ad hoc test is difficult to approve/uncertain results

***Kelo v. New London* (2005): EMINENT DOMAIN**

* Facts: New London, Ct. approved a new development project that involved using its eminent domain authority to seize private property to sell to private developers. The city stated that the purpose of this exercise of eminent domain was to create new jobs and increase tax revenues from the property sales. Kelo had owned a home there for over 60 years, and his property was in one of the areas scheduled to be condemned by the development project.
  + Kelo and nine other private owners claimed violated the “public use” requirement of Fifth Amendment b/c economic development is NOT a “public use”
  + Precedent for P claim: bright line rule that you can’t transfer property from one private owner to another private owner.
    - Other policy arguments for bright line rule:
* Holding: The city MAY validly exercise its eminent domain authority to take private property and distribute it to private developers without violating the Fifth Amendment's public use requirement. The area was sufficiently distressed to justify program of economic rejuvenation. State legislative judgments about the prudence of programs providing for the public good in these precedent cases are entitled to great deference from the judicial branch.
  + Emphasize the downstream benefits as well as the fact that it is hard to draw a clear line between public and private
  + Court cites three precedent for the fact that literal public use is NOT required and that PUBLIC PURPUSE counts as well:
    - *Berman v. Parker (1954)*
    - *Midkiff* (1984 Hawaii): make ownership broader and reduce land oligopoly)
    - *Monsanto* (1984)*:* another case of “public use” being defined as public purpose 🡪 had to do with sharing data for pesticide market
  + Public purpose allows state legislatures to make decisions, and courts should give deference.
* Concurrence (Kennedy): rational-basis PLUS test should be used (more stringent standard of review), but still passes.
  + Although courts should be deferential to legislative judgments, they should still engage in a sufficient factual inquiry to determine that eminent domain programs are not being used to unfairly advantage one private group over another in violation of Equal Protection Clause.
  + **Heightened level of review**: triggered when transferring property from one private actor to another OR likely benefits are UNLIKELY to occur
* Dissent (Thomas): The protection of private property outweighed public necessity in the minds of the Framers, as they drafted significant legal protections of private property directly into the Constitution.
* Dissent (O’Connor): Economic development takings are unconstitutional.
  + *Berman* (DC case) & *Midkiff* (Hawaii case) directly remedied HARMS within society, as opposed to this case which is simply economic development.
  + Reads these precedent cases as being limited to remedying a harm
* Rule: A state’s use of eminent domain to condemn property from private individuals and redistribute it to other private individuals constitutes a “public use” under the Fifth Amendment if it is rationally related to a conceivable public purpose, including an exclusively economic one.

Notes:

* States can expand the protections/limits of eminent domain if they’d like.
  + Kennedy approach: *Bailey v. Myers* (AZ, 2003): city could NOT take private land for transfer to private developers to construct retail office and shopping center
  + O’ Connor approach: property cannot be taken unless nature of property justifies the taking 🡪 Prohibits economic takings unless the property is causing harm
    - Colo., NJ, Ohio (cases on top of p.1167)
  + Thomas approach: “Public use” means only public ownership OR public use.
  + *Hathcock* (Mich. 2004): economic development was NOT a sufficient reason to justify condemnation of private lands for transfer to another private owner.

***Penn Coal v. Mahon* (1922): HISTORICAL ORIGINS of REGULATION TAKING**

* Facts: In 1878, Penn Coal Co. conveyed the surface of a plot of land it owned to Mahon. Retained the right to mine underneath the property, and an explicit provision in the deed stated that Mahon was taking the land subject to any risks associated with mining beneath it. In 1921, Pennsylvania enacted Kohler Act preventing coal mining that could possibly affect the integrity of any surface land. Mahon then sued Penn Coal, arguing that the new state law barred Pennsylvania Coal from mining under the property
* Holding: Permitted to continue its mining operation, b/c Mahon took the land subject to the risks associated with mining. Overregulation would be a taking.
  + Differentiate *Plymouth Coal*, b/c in that case there was a benefit to the coal companies, but here there is none 🡪 **reciprocity factor** 🡪 govt. doesn’t need to pay you if you are getting value from the new regulation.
  + Note on reciprocity – don’t need to have a reciprocity to justify taking when there is a real harm
* Dissent (Brandeis): The right of an owner to use his land as he sees fit is NOT absolute. The use of the police power will always interfere with one’s right to use his land however they see fit. However, a statute intended to protect the public is a valid use of the police power. Even though in this case, only one member of the public is involved, the statute still aims to protect the public at large. Therefore, the statute should not be considered a taking, but a valid use of the police power.
* Importance: Mahon Factors For Determining if Taking has Gone “Too Far”:
  + (a) Extent of the diminution of the value of the property,
  + (b) Nature of the public interest served by the legislation
* Rule: At some point regulation of ones land by the government is considered a taking.

***Penn Central v. NYC* (1978): AD HOC TEST**

* Facts: NYC passes preservation law designating Grand Central Terminal a landmark. Owners want to build a 50-story office building above the station, and enter into long-term lease with occupant. But law imposes duty on owner to maintain exterior features of a landmark, unless Landmarks Preservation Commission allows.
  + NYC would argue that there is a reciprocity here (like *Plymouth Coal*) and therefore should NOT need to pay
  + Penn Central argument: The regulations are somewhat arbitrary and the amount of harm is quite great 🡪 complete destruction of rights above ground.
* Holding: The law is NOT a taking. When determining whether a state regulation constitutes a taking of private property for public use with the requirement of just compensation under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, courts should consider:

1. Economic impact of the regulation on the owner
   * 1. The economic impact of the law on Penn Central does NOT constitute a total diminution of the value of its property, as it can still generate revenue from renting out portions of Grand Central Terminal. It is merely prohibited from gaining additional revenue from leasing the airspace rights above the building.
2. Interference with the owner’s reasonable investment-backed expectations
   * 1. Revenue from developed airspace was not an option when Penn Central first invested in the property.
3. The character of the government action
   * 1. Whether govt. is signaling out someone AND if they’re physically doing something

* Dissent (Rehnquist): The law’s landmarks designation is problematic b/c it imposes significant costs/restrictions on landowners, without affording many benefits beyond honor of designation. Cost of preserving landmarks should be borne by all NYC taxpayers – should be taking.
* Importance: Precedent decisions have been essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries based entirely on the facts of an individual case, with no precise standard articulated for when principles of fairness and justice require the payment of just compensation for a taking. In response to its frustration over this lack of standards, a new multi-factor test is articulated for determining when a taking requires the payment of just compensation to a property owner.
* Rule: In determining whether a state regulation constitutes a taking under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, courts should consider (1) the economic impact of the regulation on the owner, (2) the extent to which the regulation has interfered with the owner’s reasonable investment-backed expectations, and (3) the character of the government action involved in the regulation.

Penn Central’s overall assertion that any economic restriction imposed on the use of their property under the Landmarks Preservation law constitutes a taking which requires just compensation is rejected.

* The economic impact of the law on Penn Central does not constitute a total diminution of the value of its property, as it can still generate revenue from renting out portions of Grand Central Terminal.
* It is merely prohibited from gaining additional revenue from leasing the airspace rights above the building.
* Penn Central’s investment-backed expectations are not significantly impaired by the regulation, as the revenue from developed airspace was not an option when Penn Central first invested in the property.
* Finally the governmental invasion caused by the regulation is not physical (an invasion which is almost always upheld as a taking.) Rather, the government “invasion” in the present case is merely a prohibition on further development of Penn Central’s property.
* Additionally, a significant public interest in light space was furthered by regulation which prohibits the development of airspace above the terminal.

***PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins* (1980): PHYSICAL INVASIONS**

* Facts: While *Lloyd* barred free speech claims in malls, Cali court held there is a right to distribute literature in malls protected by state constitution. Students sought to solicit support for their opposition to a UN resolution against Zionism. Mall excludes them. Cali court upholds their right to protest there without being excluded.
  + Public use test of *Marsh* v. Public function test of *Lloyd*
* Holding: Since the government’s enforcement of the students’ speech rights is important and b/c it does not impair the economic value of PruneYard’s business, does not amount to a taking.
  + Even though one of the essential “sticks” in the bundle of property rights is the right to exclude, and though there was a literal taking of this right, not every destruction or injury to property is a taking.
  + ***Kaiser Aetna case*:** marina/lake made open to public 🡪 govt was required to pay b/c physically required lake to be open to public
    - Court rejects comparison to this, b/c in *Kaiser* there was economic impact which does NOT exist here (NOT BRIGHTLINE RULE)
  + **RECIPROCITY OF ADVANTAGE** would apply here as
* \*\*\*Concurrence (Marshall): PruneYard’s claim is that common law rights such as trespass may not be altered by the government. **Such a claim would impede legislative progress as it would allow no room for improvement in the common law.**
* Concurrence (Powell): Although it is true that the government may not force a private individual to provide a platform for a belief he does not hold, there is no way that patrons of PruneYard would attribute the views/statements of the students to PruneYard/owner.
* Rule: Restricting the right to exclude is not a taking. In making a determination on whether a taking has occurred, courts look to the character of the governmental action and the economic impact of the restriction in terms of the investment-backed rate of return of the owner.

***Loretto v. Teleprompter* (1982): PERMANENT PHYSICAL INVASIONS**

* Facts: NY law requires landlords to allow cable TV company to install cable facilities through property. Loretto discovers cable after purchasing building, alleging it was an unconstitutional taking without just compensation.
* Holding: Taking – permanent physical invasion is automatically a taking.
  + Teleprompter would want to apply Public policy, PennCentral, or Prune 🡪 economic impact, reasonable expectation (everyone should expect regulations to ‘invade’ your property somewhat 🡪 fire extinguishers/mailboxes), character of harm (not an invasion, just a regulation)
* Dissent (Blackmun): Difficult to distinguish “temporary” physical occupations whose constitutionality is subject to a rigid balancing process, and “permanent” physical occupations which are held to be takings without regard to other factors that a court might ordinarily examine. Majority errs in attempting to distinguish between a “permanent occupation” and a “temporary invasion.”
* Rule: A minor but permanent physical occupation of an owner’s property authorized by government constitutes a “taking” of property for which just compensation is due under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments - without regard to the public interests that it may serve or the fact that it only has a minimal economic impact on the property owner.
  + Mailbox or fire extinguisher would be OK b/c NOT owned by a third party (cable company here) but rather by the owner of the building

***Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid (2021)***

* Hinged on regulation from a Cali. labor relations law which allowed union organizers to go onto property to speak to worker (similar to *State v. Shack*)
* Owner of property (Nursery) sued that it was a taking of the right to exclude 🡪 similar to *PruneYard* + *Loretto*
  + Nursery framed as easement 🡪 b/c this is property right which govt. has encroached upon
  + State frames issue as access regulation (not a taking, just regulating the access which already exists)
  + Penn Central argument would NOT play a role here for property owner b/c Brennan says to be deferential of legislatures
  + Nursery proposed rule: bright line rule that any taking of a property right, such as an easement, is a taking 🡪 can’t leave it to govt to decide this stuff or else they’ll just keep on taking.

***Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council*: COMPLETE DEPRIVATION OF ECONOMIC USE - NEW RULE**

* Facts: Lucas buys two beachfront lots. Has hired an architect but had not started building yet. Multiple residents lived nearby. Beachfront management act comes down: he cannot build houses on it. Property has now been rendered economically useless.
  + Argue based on Penn Central that the house is as anticipatory as the hypothetical office building that was going to be built on top of Penn Central.
  + Bright line rule for the government 🡪 Threshold harm inquiry from Penn Coal 🡪 when houses are falling into ground and land is being eroded, we will not consider the other side’s claim as to whether there is an economic impact or not.
    - Precedent for this: *Mugler* (infected cedar trees)*, Powell v. Penn* (oleomargarine factory)*, Hadacheck* (brickyard) and other cases show that when there is a serious harm being regulated, the govt. is permitted to do a taking without compensation.
* Holding (Scalia): Taking. The regulation completely deprives the property of all economic value, and he is thus entitled to just compensation.
  + Brightline per se rule for the P 🡪 Just for land and land-use. Not necessarily for non-land private property. Justification for this 🡪 protecting expectations. When you buy land you expect it not to be taken by govt. but this is NOT true by property in general.
  + Exception to this brightline rule: if there was nuisance 🡪 you should expect not to be able to perform action (b/c action is nuisance) so not an issue
  + Scalia believes that nuisance ca be applied with some certainty
  + “noxious harm” v. nuisance: Scalia thinks that nuisance is more inclusive (dissent disagrees with this)
* Dissent (Stevens): This is just trading one hard to apply for another, arbitrary results test for another.
  + Another issues is where is the denominator? In Penn Central the denominator could have been just the air rights, but the court ended up saying it was the whole property. So too here, the sand still has value without a house on it.
* Dissent (Blackmun): Majority is unnecessarily broad opinion that ignores limits of jurisdiction and precedent, and creates a new categorical rule and exception, to decide a relatively simple/narrow question of law. Only question for review is whether the legislature has a rational reason for enacting the Act to address an issue affecting the public good. If so, this finding is entitled to great deference and Lucas is not entitled to payment of just compensation.
* Note: Precedent invalidates 2 categories of regulations that go “too far”:
  + (1) regulations that compel a property owner to suffer physical “invasion” on his property and
  + (2) regulations that deny all economically beneficial or productive uses of land. However, the application of the second category is troubling because there has never been an outline justified for this category of takings.
* Rule: When a state regulation deprives private property of all economic value, that regulation constitutes a taking and the owner of the property must be paid just compensation.
