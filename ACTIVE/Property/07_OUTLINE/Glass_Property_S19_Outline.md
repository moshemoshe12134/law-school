# Introduction—Advocate, predict, decide

1. Property law **governs relations between people over the external world**. It allocates who gets what in American Society today, appearing in our interactions with strangers and friends
2. Characteristics and limitations of property law
   1. **Disaggregates** ownership into separate and limited entitlements that are backed by the state. Right to exclude, Privilege to use, Power to Transfer, Immunity from loss.
   2. **Standardization** of ownership into particular bundles. Entitlements and their correlative can only be combined in certain ways.
   3. Serve human values and limited by human values, **no entitlements are absolute** (State v. Shack- social workers allowed on property to help immigrants)
   4. Justified by different policy considerations:
      1. **Fairness**: Both procedurally (same rights/opportunities to acquire property) & distributive (ends)
      2. **Efficiency**: contributes to economic growth through market participation fostered by confidence in the market
      3. **Legitimacy**: court decisions need to appear legitimate and reasonable.
      4. **Administrability**: rules should be able to be administered easily

# UNIT ONE: ACQUIRING PROPERTY

***Acquiring Property Rights: who gets to be the first to own something?***

## Wild animals, natural resources and abandoned baseballs

### The Rule of First Possession (Pierson)- fox chased on beach

1. **Rule**: Property of an animal ferae naturae (wild) is acquired by occupancy only. Mere pursuit does not confer property right. **3 elements:** A) Manifest intention B) Deprive animal of its liberty C) Bring within certain control
   1. These elements carve out an exception to actual physical possession- mortally wounding the animal is enough. If bright line approach, why not require actual possession?
      1. Fairness: protection of the law if work hard enough (an iteration of Locke)
      2. Efficiency: limits freeloaders
2. Policy arguments referenced:
   1. Labor Theory of Property (Locke): “Find and pursue”- labor converts natural possessions into the property of people. By pursuing a hare, man acquires it, it’s no longer common property.
      1. Consider both how much labor one put in and what kind (must it be productive labor?)
   2. **Bright line rules**: limit confusion & endless litigation; allows people to conform their conduct in advance
   3. **Custom**: what do those of the trade believe is the proper way, how do they deal with it? (decision will be seen as legitimate, understand the rule & can help the court in complex areas)
   4. **Tradition**: what has been the general approach to this issue in the history of man
   5. **Incentives** generally: rule of possession might dissuade people from starting the hunt, fear of animal being snatched at last second- want to **rid ourselves** of the fox. Also, others that jump in are **free riders**
3. Note: **Constructive possession**- if animal on your land, then you own it (ducks in pond case- Keeble).

![](data:image/png;base64...)

In Swift and Gifford, the courts deferred to the custom of the fisherman. In Swift, rewarded the whale to the first lodge a harpoon in the whale, even though another pursued and captured (so long as the original harpooners continued the chase). In Ghen, rewarded the whale to the hunters that sunk the whale with a bomb lance, even though others collected it when its body rose to the surface a few days later.

### The Rule of Capture (Elliff)- Gas well exploded due to reckless drilling

1. Under the **law of capture** there is no liability for reasonable and legitimate drainage from the common pool. A landowner is privileged to sink as many wells as he desires upon his tract of land and extract therefrom and appropriate all the oil and gas that he may produce, so long as he operates within the spirit and purpose of conservation statutes. (law created b/c often multiple landowners shared a common reservoir of gas beneath their properties).
2. **Rule:** **Negligent waste or destruction** of gas and distillate drained from a neighboring well under the law of capture **is not legal appropriation of those minerals**.
3. Policy arguments referenced:
   1. Want to make sure people are drilling safely and that there isn’t a race to the bottom of the well- based on the State conservation statutes and railroad statutes.
   2. Law of capture also meant to provide each owner the reasonable opportunity to collect their fair share of oil that they are in theory entitled to. Would be unfair to allow others to act in a reckless manner

### The Rule of Pre-Possessory Interest (Popov)- p didn’t catch ball due to crowd mob

1. **Rule**: Where an actor undertakes **significant but incomplete** steps to achieve possession of a piece of abandoned personal property and the effort is interrupted by the **unlawful acts** of others, the actor has a legally cognizable **pre-possessory interest** in the property. That pre-possessory interest constitutes a **qualified right** to possession which can support a cause of action for conversion.
2. **Holding and reasoning**: equitable decision that had the ball sold and split between the two of them. While P established an interest in the ball, D was not one of the parties that interfered with P and it was not clear that P would have definitely caught the ball. (maintained judicial integrity & did what most parties would want ex ante)
   1. **Popov**: like Elliff, courts should not encourage people to try & take away the pre-possessory rights of someone. **Hayashi:** like Pierson v Post: until acquire it, have no possession over it
3. Incentives? Could fail to curtail mobs at games because the theoretical catcher doesn’t receive full ownership

## Land and Human beings- Acquisition by force

### The Doctrines of Discovery & Conquest (Johnson) (Antelope – legality of international slave trade)

1. **Rule (Johnson)**: Discovery of land brings with it the right to obtain title either by purchase or conquest
2. Positivist Theory of Property (Bentham, Marshall)
   1. **Bentham**: Property and law rely on each other. Before laws were made, there was no property. Take law away and property ceases. Because property is based on “**expectation**,” which the laws provides.
   2. **Marshall**: Court looked past abstract principles of justice to principles of law- the original laws by which our **government & civilization** have functioned. Europeans had agreed that in order to avoid quarreling, whoever discovered land first would have rule and control over it, giving each government exclusive title over their land- necessarily stripping the natives of their full ownership.
      1. Noted power of “**public opinion**:” conquerors must not strip the conquered of their property/ private rights-their actions are restrained by that of public opinion (would injure government fame and power). Didn’t apply to natives—because they were savages and couldn’t be integrated
   3. **Antelope (slave ships confiscated):** Slavery wasn’t contrary to “**law of nations**”. Again, Marshall didn’t focus on principles of justice, but on laws that had actually been in place. Positive law > Natural Law.
      1. Unclear whether the positive law was as clear as Marshall claimed: true slave trade had been engaged with & sanctioned by many of the nations of the world, but the U.S had in fact banned it.
      2. Raises question: what should a judge do when faced with a rule that seems unjust? Perhaps, seek an ambiguity in the law or frame the facts to distinguish the case from the unjust law
      3. **Takeaway**: can look to custom or other laws to understand **whether there is a property right** in something when the court is unclear if there should be
   4. **Notes:** Aftermath of Johnson: two later courts seemed somewhat inconsistent w/ Johnson (Indians rights to occupancy is considered sacred; all the settlers gained was the exclusive right to purchase lands that the natives were willing to sell). But see 1955 court—constitution did not protect tribal property unless congress had formally affirmed title of the land.
3. **Davis v. Evans:** A master who **permits his infant slave** to remain with its mother during infancy, free from his control, will not be construed to have abandoned his right; nor will the possession of the mother be such adverse possession as is protected by the statute of limitation.
   1. Adverse possession claim denied, the “labor” she put into her child for 17 years was denied
   2. Master had title to girl because of rule: **Partus Sequitur Ventrum**- “status of any child will follow that of its mother.” Done in order to build an economy to use mothers for their reproductive labor
4. Philosophical thoughts on the topic:
   1. **Blackstone**: we are pleased w/ possession but afraid to look back to the means by which is was acquired.
   2. **Baldwin**: History is something we carry with us, controls us and present in everything we do
   3. Whiteness as property (Harris): The origins of property rights in the U.S are rooted in racial domination. Distinct forms of exploitation (Blacks & Native Americans) contributed to the construction of whiteness as property

## Information (news)- world of public goods

### The Quasi-Property Doctrine of Misappropriation (I.N.S. & Motorola)

1. **Rule (INS v. AP):** A co-operative association of **newspapers** organized for the gathering, distributing, and publishing of news may **enjoin a rival news agency from selling news** taken from the bulletins issued by the association or any of its members, or from newspapers published by them (limited to a reasonable amount of time based on the value of the news).
   1. **Quasi-Property** acknowledged and protected. No individual property right in news or facts, but right **against a competitor in the field**
   2. The acquisition of the news required an elaborate organization and large expenditure of money, had value to the collector based on its novelty and had evidently had value to those that could misappropriate it.
2. **Public goods:** non-rivalrous good that cannot exclude others from. A collective action or freeriding issue.
3. Labor theory of property (**Locke**): exerted their labor to collect the news. (would be arguably unfair to allow someone else to profit off of their labor, even if “common property.”)
4. Utilitarian theory of property (Demsetz & Ostrom)
   1. **Demsetz: Tragedy of the commons:** people act independently and selfishly as they consume a shared resource, spoiling the resource through their collective action. Each will try to free-ride on the other.
      1. Which is the concern here- people will not labor to uncover information if it isn’t protected, leaving the “resource” of information underused and spoiled for all.
   2. **Elinor Ostrom:** will not always have the “tragedy of the free-rider,” **don’t always need a robust private** right, but rather people are intelligent enough to get together on their own to collaborate in a way that they can all benefit. When communally created and owned common property exists, often times they are more productive than nearby individual owned property systems (condominiums, residential subdivisions).
      1. Arguably, this is the system AP created/ attempting to defend. If the court disallows INS to copy the news, it creates the proper incentives to pursue and gather news without a robust private right
      2. Counter: by calling on the court to protect this collaborative news system created by the AP, it shows that without some government interference, the tragedy of the commons exists.
5. Relevance of copyright? None because 1) back then needed to register for copyright, 2) cannot copyright facts 3) state *common law* did not protect works upon publication
6. **Dissents:**
   1. Holmes: all that is necessary is that the INS gives the AP **credit**. Labor doesn’t necessarily give someone a right. Additionally, the question of whether someone is willing to pay for it is entirely **circular**. People will only pay for it if it is protected by the court. The higher the protection, the higher the market value.
   2. Brandies: this is intangible property that isn’t governed by the current rules; it is not for the court to balance the different concerns here. The **legislature** should investigate and change the law if needed
7. **Hot News Doctrine:** after Erie, INS no longer has precedential value, but state courts have adopted the doctrine as state law. *NBA v. Motorola* (NY): hot news tort requires (1) time-sensitive factual information; (2) free-riding by the defendant; & (3) a threat “to the very existence of the product or service provided by the plaintiff.”

## Intellectual property

* **Utilitarian**: Need most protection when innovation is costly, and copying is cheap, so can recoup investment. (if copying is hard or can benefit by being the first mover, less need). Tensions: cost of prior knowledge making invocation more costly and increases prices for consumers. **Balance between encouraging innovation with property right and not creating a monopoly that would frustrate innovation, growth and social welfare**.
* **Lockean theory**: entitled to the products of their own labor by creating something genuinely new. **Tensions**: all the “new” works in some way **draw on the works of others**. Also, would seem to protect right in property simply if put work into creating it- even if not first to discover, and while copyright protects that, patent law does not.
* **Personhood theories**: the investors very identity becomes bound up with the invention or creation. **Tensions**: same as Lockean theory; additionally, other super fans selves can also become wrapped up with the creation

### The Lanham Act & The Functionality Doctrine (Qualitex)

1. **The Lanham Act (Trademark):** right to exclude others from using a symbol that helps identify your product or service. (act made to stabilize the market place, based on and limited by the commerce clause)
   1. The term Trademark includes any “**word, name, symbol or device, or any combination therein**”
   2. Used by a person with the intention of using it in commerce to **identify** and **distinguish** his goods from

those sold or made by others and to indicate the **source** of the good, even if that source is unknown

1. **Generic names cannot be copyrighted**- names representing particular companies might become generic over time (Kleenex, Band-Aid)
   1. Can be extended indefinitely, no limit on years.
2. *Qaulitex v. Jacobson:* (green dry-cleaning press pads)
   1. **Rule**: Color can be trademarked, if it satisfies the requirements of trademark law. (Even though color was not explicitly listed in the statute)
3. **Functionality doctrine:** an item will not fall under trademark if characteristic that one is attempting to trademark **relates to the essential function/purpose** of the item or effects the costs/quality of the article
   1. If not essential to the use/purpose of the article and does not affect the cost or quality, will pass.
   2. Issue: **circular** to some extent, if something receives protection by the court, will affect the cost and perhaps quality of an item.

### The Copyright Act & The Originality Requirement (Feist)

1. **Copyright Act of 1976:** (generally limited to life of author plus 70 years)
   1. Copyright applies to original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression (now known or later developed) from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated
   2. Includes the **following categories**: literary, musical, dramatic, choreographic, pictorial, graphic, sculptural, motion pictures, sound recordings and architectural works.
   3. To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries
   4. **Note**: American Airlines case displays that courts might be **hesitant** to copyright things that could be covered under trademark
2. ***Feist Publication v. Rural Telephone:***
   1. **Holding**: the phonebook directory did not meet the originality standard, simply **compiled facts** and listed them in alphabetical order.
   2. **Rule:** Copyright protection is granted to original works. The compilation of facts, if creative/original may satisfy the requirement, however, facts alone are not copyrightable.
   3. **Originality, not “sweat of the brow**” is the touchstone of copyright protection. It must have been independently created by the author and have some degree of originality or creativity.
      1. Why originality? Balance right incentives- allow people to use past work, while protecting work as well. Want people to invest in labor, but also want to make sure society as a whole is better off
      2. While trademark has no “originality” requirement, it must be registered to be valid and will be rejected if in prior use and had not been abandoned
      3. Copyright no longer needs to be registered, only must register when want to sue for infringement

### The Patent Act & Rule Against Patents of Naturally Occurring Objects (Myriad)

1. **Patent Act:** Whoever invents or discovers any **new and useful**…composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefore, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.
   1. Last for 20 years. Might last less than other areas because want to further scientific discoveries that can be difference between life and death (Patents also often lose value relatively quicker than copyrighted works)
   2. The invention must **be new, useful, non-obvious** and subject matter eligible (one of the types of inventions protected by the statute).
2. ***Myriad v. AMP:***
   1. **Rule:** a naturally occurring DNA segment is not patentable, solely because it had been isolated. Extensive effort alone is insufficient
   2. **Holding:** could patent the CDNA because was not naturally occurring, but can patent the isolated parts of cells because cannot patent **naturally occurring things**
      1. **Efficiency argument**: patents are meant to promote creation, allowing patents for naturally occurring things would impede creation. Need to balance the right amount of protection.
      2. **Locke argument**: can only take possession of something if mix your labor with it. If something is in naturally occurring state and didn’t change it in any way, then won’t take control of it.

### The Rule Against Common Law Ownership of One’s Cells (Moore)

1. **Regents v. Moore:** (made cell line out of Moore’s cells w/o telling him. Moore brought claim of conversion).
   1. **Rule**: 1) A physician has a **fiduciary duty** to disclose elements of medical treatment and interests which may influence their personal judgment. 2) Once cells leave a patient’s body, they are **no longer the “patient’s property.**”
      1. Court didn’t realize that they indirectly created a market and negotiation of bodily material. Once patient informed, he can decline to go through with procedure unless given a piece of the pie.
   2. Reasoning:
      1. Cells are **not really unique** to Moore, everyone has same basic cells for this purpose
      2. **California regulations** drastically limit a patient’s control over excised cells by regulating disposal of human tissue.
      3. Concern of hindering research by giving all patients property rights in all cell lines everywhere. **Impair socially beneficial** research and would end up with endless disputes
      4. The fact that the patent was awarded shows that there was **creation here**, it wasn’t for the cells itself and therefore it shouldn’t belong to Moore
      5. **Institutional competence**: it is a consequential decision that the **legislature** should deal with
   3. Concurrence and Dissents:
      1. Concurrence: Mentions the “**human vessel**,” and it is degrading to humanity to treat body parts as property and to make it into a commodity.
      2. Broussard (partial dissent): overblown concerns of litigation, most cells acquired with consent. Court didn’t elevate cells above the market place-rather created a market for everyone but Moore.
      3. Mosk: **bundle of entitlements**- property is a bundle and can realize that some rights can be rid of while still holding onto the core. May be able to give over right of possession but can still retain some of the other rights that came with your cells. Can still protect one’s personhood, while defending these broader interests.
   4. **Note cases:** (1) D’s donated brother’s corneas in course of performing an autopsy- woman had a property interest & legitimate claim of entitlement to his body & right to control how his body would be disposed. (2) Courts seem to be split if same ruling would apply in Cal. under Moore.
2. Personhood theory of property (Radin and Cohen):
3. **Radin- Market Inalienability:**
   1. To be a person, need to have some control over resources in the external environment
   2. Spectrum of property: “**Personal Goods**”- objects bound up with ourselves, and “**Fungible Goods**”- perfectly replaceable with money.
   3. **Test to assist in determining which type**: Why holding it- for exchange or for use? Can it be replaced- if it is not replaced what happens to you? Is the good in question external or internal?
   4. Critique of theory: much of this is only true of items of relatively same value, but at some point, a person will pick money no matter how “personal” the item. Also, too subjective when trying to apply to the market at large.
4. **Cohen- Commodification:**
   1. Two general anti-commodification arguments
      1. **Coercion**:
         * **Unequal bargaining power:** will force poor people that are desperate to part with their organs “against their will.”
         * **Access issue**: only the rich will benefit- very unequal distribution of goods
      2. **Corruption argument:**
         * Something wrong with selling an **essential** thing-like body parts- and turning it into a commodity. Wrong to exchange items that are clearly in different spheres of value
         * Essentialist: due to moral relativism issues, Cohen says shouldn’t just look at the nature of the good- nothing is truly fundamental, **but the nature of the transaction itself**. That will inform whether it is a moral issue or not.

## Law of Finders- Presumption and relativity of title

### Possession and presumption of title (Wilcox v. Stroup)

1. P tried selling documents in his family possession of years, D tried stopping sale, arguing it belonged to the state
2. **Rule**: When there isn’t enough evidence to establish title, there is a rebuttable presumption that whoever possesses the object is the owner. Adversary must do more than bring into question the possessor’s ownership
   1. Solves otherwise impenetrable difficulties, need for a default rule. Would otherwise be very hard and costly to **administer**, and would cause lots of litigation
   2. It promotes **stability**- allows people to expect what their assets will be moving forward.
   3. **Legitimacy**: a defensible system, where people feel that their rights are being protected

### Relativity of title- Finder and Subsequent Possessor (Armory)

1. **Armory:** Chimney sweep found a gem, took it jeweler to get in valued, Jeweler did not give it back
   1. **Rule:** A finder has possessory interest against all, except the rightful owner. More accurately, the finder has a right against **all subsequent possessors, but not those will a greater possessory** interest in the property (like original owners, landowners, previous finders [even if would lose against true owner])
      1. Create **incentives** for finders to find valuable items that are not being used- improves social welfare. Also, benefits owners, more people looking out for lost items- increasing chances he gets it back. Also, easily administrable.
   2. Finders will lose against original owners of **lost** (accidentally misplaced) and **mislaid** property (owner intentionally left it somewhere and forgets where put it) but win when property **abandoned** (intent to relinquish right to property- lost or mislaid can become abandoned if owner’s intent is as such).
   3. Superior title**:** not confined to true owners, but rather to those with **better title** (even thieves-see later)
   4. Landowner and finder**:** landowner will win if finder was **trespassing**. If not trespassing: if found in **private home** ordinarily awarded to homeowner; if found in **place open to the public**- courts go both ways, many *distinguish* between lost (or abandoned) & mislaid- lost going to the finder and mislaid going to property owner (entrusted w/ property in some way). If property is **embedded** in the soil-no matter the type- will be awarded to the property owner (part of the real property). Exception- **Treasure Trove**: gold, silver and sometimes money, buried/concealed in antiquity or so long as to indicate the owner is dead or unknown will be granted to finder as long as wasn’t trespassing.
      1. If finder was trespassing, certainly would lose against landowner, but courts split if would prevail against a subsequent possessor, traditionally he would, but modern approach is to deny possessory rights to those who obtained possession illegally (assume would apply to theft also)
   5. Finder statutes:rid distinctions, must report lost property and will be granted it if owner doesn’t come forward or will be given small fee if he does
   6. Transfer of stolen property:a thief ordinarily has no right to transfer title to a third party, therefore if thief sells to innocent 3rd party the original owner can claim it from the 3rd party. But, when the owner voluntarily entrusts another with possession of her property, the law sometimes gives the grantee the power to transfer title to a bona fide purchaser (Rental company couldn’t recover from innocent third party when the renter/thief – who was a **merchant that regularly dealt in such goods** – forged the title to the car and sold it). Also, if forced to sell under duress/fraud, can recover from buyer unless already transferred to bona fide purchaser
   7. **Ask**: Who is owner up against? What type of property is it on? What was the status of the good?
2. **Charrier v. Bell:**
   1. **Rule:** Burial of artifacts with the dead does not constitute abandonment
      1. Not perfect chain of title, but tribe was accumulation of descendants of the original owners
      2. Natives didn’t bury items in ground to abandon them, but for specific reasons
      3. **Unjust Enrichment:** not applicable, they were not enriched- rather disturbed. Moreover, he knew he was trespassing, acquiring the items an in illegal way-wasn’t a result of mistake.
         * 5 Factors: (1) enrichment: (2) impoverishment; (3) connection between the two; (4) absence of justification or cause for the enrichment & impoverishment; (5) no other remedy available
   2. **Native Americans Graves Protection Act:** cannot remove or disturb native remains and burial goods from federal or tribal land without tribal consent.
   3. State law protection of graves limited to clearly marked cemeteries & restrict standing to limited relatives
3. **Christy v. Scott:** When have shifting property law regimes from different sovereigns—court will still apply a clear rule that whoever’s title is first will be good against all subsequent possessors— relativity of title.

# Unit Two: The right to exclude

***Regulating Exclusion through Common Law, Statutory, & Constitutional Rights of Access***

* Facts and circumstances often matter whether access is allowed-rights are relative. Competing interests of parties and interests of society as a whole will be considered.
* Consider the sources of law, the facts and the competing policy rationales
* Core right of property law, plays big role in defining hierarchy of power that property represents.
  + One side: allows owners broad zone of discretion to put their property to its most productive use, economizes information costs making it easy to navigate through the world
  + Counter: authority to determine the use (not exclude) is the key—as long as other must accommodate owners use decisions, wouldn’t seem to interfere with most productive use of property. Also, owners often want to convey more than just “keep out,” they want to invite entry w/ limits-giving owners’ total discretion of what their invitation means might drive up info costs.

Law of trespassinteracts with and defines that right to exclude

1. **State v. Shack-** social workers went onto property against owners will to assist immigrants on property
   1. **Rule:** A right to exclude might not overcome public policy considerations. **Ownership of property is not absolute and will not overrule human values**-individuals right to receive government services.
      1. “Property rights serve human values- they are recognized to that end and are limited by it”
      2. “Indeed, the needs of the occupants may be so imperative and their strength so weak, that the law will deny the occupants the power to contract away what is deemed essential to their health, welfare, or dignity.”
   2. Reasoning:
      1. Unlike company town in Marsh, and also decided not to rule that state law would violate supremacy clause- wanted to decide on non-constitutional terms to actually broaden the rights of immigrants- even on state grounds they would have this right.
      2. Common law elements of trespass: **“Unprivileged intentional intrusion on property possessed by another”** (Protects the landowner even in the absence of an affirmative denial to come in; for criminal liability-require explicit prohibition to enter). Entry is **privileged**: if done with consent of owner or it is justified by necessity due to avoid a worse harm to persons or property or is otherwise encouraged by public policy.
      3. 4 Possible rationales:
         * **Possessory** Interests: seemed not this way, because court said caselaw was unclear if like tenant. BUT, said that the workers could have guests on the land so long as they didn’t interfere (didn’t seem to limit just to government workers) Maybe quasi property?
         * **Necessity**: workers needed assistance, must ensure they can be helped.
         * **Reliance**: they weren’t strangers but had an ongoing **relationship** that made them mutually dependent. Court can intervene in these situations to impose obligations each has to the other that are in line with society deems fair. Here, as the workers work longer they lose power, while the owner gains- court protects them.
         * **Market Inalienability**: the workers also have a **personhood and dignity interest** in their living quarters. Ruling cabins the personhood interest of the owner to only his property and not the people on it.
2. **Common Wealth v. Magadini**- homeless man arrested for sleeping (trespassing) in multipurpose buildings at night (i.e. they were not private homes)
   1. **Rule:** Once the foundational requirements are met, the necessity defense allows a jury to consider the plight of a homeless person against any harms caused by trespass before determining criminal responsibility
      1. **Elements:** (1) a **clear and imminent** danger, not one which is debatable or speculative; (2) a **reasonable** expectation that his or her action will be effective in abating the danger; (3) no legal **alternative** to avoid the danger; and (4) the Legislature has not acted to preclude the defense by a clear and deliberate choice regarding the values at issue.”
   2. Reasoning: Turned on third element- homeless person is not required to try and gain entry into a shelter he had been denied entry into multiple times. Also, not required to move to another town.
      1. ACLU attorney: poverty is not a crime, the decision forces and incentivizes the community to **find a place for the homeless**
      2. Could argue will take some weight off of government to act- if they can take shelter on private property. But the government is elected by the people, so if people are concerned, government will be
3. **Notes:**
   1. Allowed to trespass for necessity but required to **compensate** the owner for any damage caused (don’t have to pay for mere privilege of access). *Ploof v. Putnam:* D committed a tort when unmoored P’s boat form D’s dock during a storm. *Vincent:* P required to pay for damage to dock it moored at during storm.
   2. ***Ad coelum* maxim**: “when own soil, also own to the heavens and down to the depths.” Accurate for trespass near the surface, as move further away the doctrine has lost some of its relevance. Settled law that airplane overflights do not give rise to a cause of action of trespass (but, more willing to allow a claim if near the surface). Also, beneath the surface—injecting fracking fluid & beads are allowed to be injected into column of space even if some of it underlies the property of another.
   3. Half the states allow hunting on private land unless owner put up “no trespassing” sign. U.S used to be a “fence out” state (your responsibility to keep others wandering cattle out), but is now “fence in.” Sweden has “right to roam”—can camp & pass through all land on countryside if don’t interfere with use/damage.
   4. **Graves**: may be granted access to visit grave of loved one even if currently on private property
   5. **Investigative Journalism**-gaining entry on false pretenses: ***Food Lion****:* 4th Circuit ruled that while the initial entry under false pretenses wasn’t trespass-because given permission- the videotaping was outside the **scope** of the permission and therefore trespass. But court found that there were no damages (airing the video was protected under 1st amendment no matter how obtained) and awarded only nominal damages (lesson: can violate trespass w/o doing any damage). ***Desnick****:* Judge Posner denied trespass claim entirely. Sometimes fraudulently obtained consent will be valid and other times it will not- people often hide their real motives when entering property. Will distinguish based on specific interests’ owners have in excluding others from their property—is it an interference with the ownership or use of land. Here, the medical practice opened themselves up for anyone that wanted treatment, the doctors were videotaped during professional conduct and it didn’t interfere with the operations—no trespass. (Unlike competitor sneaking into another firm’s premises to steal secrets or fake electrician gaining entry into a home).
   6. **Trespass of Chattels**—to receive damages or injunction for movable property must allege some injury or dispossession or intentional using or intermeddling. ***Intel****:* sending unauthorized emails to the company server was not trespass, no damage done. ***Ebay****:* damages granted when D sent 100k information requests to eBay’s servers diminishing the value of eBay’s servers by consuming a portion or it bandwidth and server capacity.
   7. **Trespass and government searches**: 4th amendment states that the people have the right to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures. In past, question was whether the D has a “reasonable expectation of privacy (*Katz*).” A recent decision simply asked if the government’s actions constituted a trespass (*Jones*). Today, can take either lines of analysis. Also note—unclear if “open fields”, not mentioned in constitution, would be protected. ***Jardines****:* an invitation to approach the front door can be implied from the habits of the country, but that invitation does not extend to drug-sniffing dogs.
4. **Glavin V. Eckman**- cutting down the oak trees in order to enhance the view
   1. **Rule**: There is broad **discretion** in trespass cases to determine the appropriate measure of **damages**, including reasonable restoration damages- especially when the nature of the property is **unusual**. (as opposed to just awarding the market value of the lumber or diminution of the property value)
      1. He has a specific purpose for those trees and therefore only restoration would make him whole
      2. In reality: the cost of restoration was much more costly than the amount he received. In fact, what he received was not even enough to cover his legal fees
      3. Court seemed to really be attempting to balance the interests here, as opposed to finding the actual value of restoration. Rules on the books, make not end up beneficial in practice.
5. **Takeaway:** robust protection for the right to exclude that has been limited in particular circumstances for justice

## Adverse Possession- turning trespassers into full owners

1. What are the parameters of the law and why do we have it?
   1. **State statutes of limitations**- written laws that limit the time by which the owner can eject someone from their land, after which the owner loses that right. When true owner loses their right to eject- lose right to exclude, so the adverse possessor has the right to use and possess the property.
      1. **Avoids stale claims**- people will come forward with all sorts of **claims** that are hard to prove, wasting time and money. Want to lower costs of establishing rightful ownership.
      2. **Quiet Title**: even though we have a register today, want to ensure that there is no wasted time—shortens period that **prospective buyers/lenders** need to examine state of title
      3. **Penalizes the sleeping owner**: should have brought earlier. Corollary- adverse possessor began to rely on the property
      4. **Protecting** the adverse possessor: to some extent you **become part of the land**. Holmes (Radin)
   2. Common law that takes the status quo and transfers actual title of the property.
      1. By giving the root of title, **remove all the baggage** that would weigh down the real estate market. Never need to relitigate or look into how property was acquired. Practical & efficient.
   3. Quick points from book (overlap from class stuff above): (1) **settles** disputes and furthers future **transactions**; (2) prevents **valuable** resources from being left idle; (3) Protected **settled** expectations who has shaped his roots in property—possessor would feel more loss than true owner would feel gain; (4) likely to **value the property more** than the other; (5) like 3, but focused on justice and fairness, not economics (Radin); (6) **moral** principle of protecting reliance on relationships—morally wrong for true owner to generate expectations and then cut it off
2. **Brown v. Gobble-** good faith trespasser, thought owned the landof neighbor based on a fence between them
   1. **Elements of Adverse Possession:** (not all courts have exact same, partly due to overlap)
      1. **Actual possession**: must have actually (physically) possessed it the way an average owner might
         * Enclosing w/ a fence may or might not be sufficient (some courts distinguish between border fences-yes; and fences of convivence to separate animals-no)
         * Often sufficient: farming, clearing land, building, living, conducting business
      2. **Open and notorious**: gives notice to the landowner so that he can object
         * Don’t need to show owner knew- enough that reasonable inspection would disclose
         * Often Sufficient: fences, building, clearing land, moving grass, laying down a driveway, using for parking or storage or garbage removal, harvesting crops
      3. **Exclusivity**: cannot have been using it with the owner, if was sharing it with the owner than cannot establish a claim. (Serves as a limit for what land you can actually claim)
         * Valid claim even if allows others access as long as in line w/ what an owner would do
         * Occasional entry by the actual owner may not defeat a claim
         * Two adverse possessors that possess property jointly may acquire joint ownership
      4. **Continuous use**: don’t need to be there full time but use it the same way an owner might- ensures that the adverse possessor is really stuck to the land and committed.
         * If have summer home, then only need to be there summers-was it is customarily used
      5. **Adverse & hostile**: need to show **not permissive**, owner cannot have permitted the use
         * Presumption of non-permissiveness-true owner must bring evidence that use was allowed (split in courts when possessor and title holder are in same family if presumption valid)
         * **Adverse Possessor’s state of mind:** 4 approaches: (1) **Objective test** (majority)- don’t care about mindset; (2) **Claim of right**-trying to possess- practically usually just another objective test but some require showing of subjective intent to be the owner; (3) **Intentional Dispossession-** knows occupying another’s land and intends to supplant the true owner, will fail if mistaken belief (logic—efficient use of land, improve property left behind that is beneficial for other neighbors, unlikely in good faith border disputes that will cause animus with neighbors ); (4) **Good Faith Test**- must think wasn’t on someone’s land-only can acquire by mistake (some lower statute limitations if present)
         * **Ouster:** Co-owners of an entire property are allowed to access entire property, to make claim of adverse possession on entire must make explicit statement of intent. (relatedly- once given permission, remains unless revoked or possessor declares intent to oust)
      6. **Statute of limitations**: must have been there x amount of years:
         * **Tacking doctrine**- if two parties in **privity** with each other, then they can be chained to make up the amount of time needed under the statute of limitations
         * If previous owners had it for the required amount of years, enough simply to show chain of title- as the previous owners already established adverse possession (See Gobble)
         * Many states will **toll the clock** if true owner has disability such as infancy or insanity. Other categories may include imprisonment or absence from state.
   2. **Claims against Government:** generally, cannot prevail against the government; but a large number of states have limited or abolished governmental immunity. Others have limited by common law- allowing if property not held for public use or dedicated for commercial purpose or otherwise not open to public. A federal statute allows for adverse possession claims after 20 years if in good faith reliance on claim or color of title and has either cultivated or constructed improvements on the land.
   3. Adverse possessors generally obtain rights subject to preexisting liens, easements, restrictive covenant… **but only** if they didn’t act in a manner inconsistent with those interests (if they did- interest extinguished)
   4. NY law: no adverse possession for border disputes unless permanent structure built (otherwise considered de minimis and non-adverse.
3. **Romero v. Garcia- Color of Title** (deed from parents that was void for technical reasons, but otherwise valid)
   1. **Color of Title:** when written document seems to pass title but does not do so because: (1) person that conveys it does not actually own the land it purports to convey (Gobble); (2) lacks a signature (Romero); (3) mistaken or ambiguous description; (4) or acquired through a faulty procedure.
   2. **Rule**: A void, unsigned deed is sufficient to create color of title for an adverse possession claim, provided the property description and extrinsic evidence are enough to enable a surveyor to ascertain the **boundaries** of the property. (Markers in deed were deemed to sufficiently describe the land)
   3. Still need other elements of adverse possession, color of title simply makes **clear** what parts of the land you had dominion over and in some states makes the statute of limitations **shorter**.
      1. If have color of title & occupy any portion of the land described, considered actual possession of **whole lot**
      2. Some states **actually require** color of title as a pre-req for any adverse possession claim
      3. If intended to convey, but failed for technical reason- how is it adverse? 2 approaches: Yes—because occupying as owner, not under permission of owner; No—exception to rule.
      4. Same rules apply by prescriptive easements
4. **Nome v. Fagerstrom- squatters (use the way an owner would)**
   1. **Rule**: Actions required for adverse possession depend on the nature/character of land. The requirements will be met if the land is used for the statutory period as an average owner would use similar property.
   2. **Holding:** part of the land the squatters used the land as a **normal owner** - therefore they were entitled to that land. Didn’t use the southern portion much- therefore there was no adverse possession claim.
      1. Different question for rural Alaska- standard of exclusivity here is different, if let people come on, but that is normal, then that won’t be a sign that they didn’t own the land exclusively.
      2. Takeaway: elements mostly just come down to if the court thinks the person has taken possession
   3. **Most courts** don’t apply special rule to rural, wooded or unimproved land (but naturally what an average owner would do is different); **others** require greater acts to establish open and notorious to provide notice; while still **others** lower the bar for acts as a matter of law in rural areas because average owners use it less
      1. **Some suggest** removing presumption of non-permissiveness for remote unimproved areas.
   4. **Efficient bad faith trespasser:** want them to act, because otherwise people aren’t utilizing the land and society is worse off. Also, the squatter seems to value the property more.
      1. Other defenses of bad faith trespasser: owner is partially to blame for not bringing suit earlier- all eventually entitled to repose; failure to object might be abandonment of rights; proving good faith could be difficult—want property rights to be stable and predictable

## Prescriptive Easements

1. **Community Feed Store v. Northeastern-** trucks had been backing up on neighboring property for years; neighbor had a survey done and realized that they were backing up on his land and built a barrier.
   1. **Rule**: It is sufficient to establish a claim of prescriptive easement if one claims the **general outlines** of the area of his continuous, adverse, and notorious use with reasonable certainty
   2. For prescriptive easement and adverse possession most courts require clear and convincing evidence
2. Why did D claim a right to **use** through prescriptive easement instead of acquiring **title** through adverse **possession**? Distinction between use and possession is sometimes unclear—P.E generally only covers specific uses or entitlements; question will be if adverse claimant exercised sufficient control to obtain title by A.P or has only engaged in specific acts that would result in grant of P.E
   1. Many courts look to see if use was **exclusive**- prescriptive easement doesn’t need exclusive use, just right to use. (few courts require exclusivity for prescriptive easement also)
   2. Some courts require **acquiescence**—owner must have actively known people were using it and did nothing to stop it (but, must be adverse-owner did not give permission). Perhaps done to protect property owners and only penalize those owners that give mixed messages. (Some courts apply acquiescence, but define it in a way that adds nothing to the elements)
   3. Some courts protect owners of prescriptive easements over large bodies of unenclosed land under a “**neighborhood accommodation exception**- owners could not reasonably know of passing over the land
3. Courts generally assume **non-permissiveness**. If meet other requirements, will presume you are a trespasser and the use is **adverse**. (practical- generally accurate; social welfare- adverse possessor values it more; Reliance-want to make sure users don’t get screwed). Thumb on scales for the trespasser- regulating the right to exclude.
   1. Some courts have presumption of permissiveness by **use** (unlike possession). Perhaps more accurate-neighbors frequently allow others to cross over their land as a kindly gesture
      1. Some only apply this presumption if community practice was to allow such uses
      2. Here too, some require claim of right (or good faith/ bad faith)
4. **Trees:** most courts have made exception-no P.E for overhanging trees (some courts may allow a claim)
5. **Acquisition by public:** traditionally the public could not make a claim of prescriptive easement, but modern approach is that the public may acquire these easements
   1. But, most courts **presume** that public access to private land is **permissive** in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, defeating the prescription claim by the public
      1. My note: would seem that any individual bringing a claim would also be presumed to have permission if accessed the land in the same way the public did
   2. Some states statutes declare a private road used by the public for x amount of time a public highway (few even apply this doctrine to beaches)
6. **Zuni Tribe** (courseworks and 319)- pilgrimage through a property near the Grand Canyon
   1. Prescriptive Easement claim granted for pilgrimage every 4 years- this was considered continuous enough
   2. “The proof necessary to establish a prescriptive easement to use land is not the same as that to establish a claim of title by adverse possession.” It is only the use to which the premises are put which must be shown to be adverse, open and notorious. To the extent that the use is established, it, of course, is hostile to the title of the servient [i.e., burdened] estate.”

## Other Remedial Doctrines: Encroachment

1. **Somerville v. Jacobs:** accidently built structure on another’s land
   1. **Rule**: If by reasonable mistake of fact and in good faith, one erects a building entirely on someone’s land with reasonable belief that they own the land, they are entitled to recover for the **value** of the improvements from the landowner, or can, alternatively, **purchase** the land from the landowner for the value of the land minus the improvements.
2. **Traditional rules:**
   1. If **encroaching structure** on land, had **absolute right to have it removed**, no matter the cost
   2. If **entire** structure built on land belonging to another, the building would **belong** to the owner of the land
      1. (Dissent in Somerville keeps to this rule- thinks modern rule is like private eminent domain)
3. **Modern rules:**
   1. **Doctrine of Relative Hardship:** If was a good faith/innocent encroachment;the court considers: (1) Degree of harm; (2) Degree of interference with true owner’s property; (3) Cost of removal
      1. If the costs of the removal are not high or it greatly interferes with true owners use of land-removal will be ordered. But if costs are high and interference is low- will allow encroachment to remain if encroacher pays damages for decrease in property value or order a forced sale of the property equal to the value of the land taken plus a premium for involuntarily giving up land.
   2. If erect building entirely on another’s land mistakenly, the landowner becomes the owner of the structure
      1. But, **some courts**-like Somerville- require that the owner at least **compensate** the builder for the benefit; and if not- will **force a sale** of the value of the land w/o the improvements
         * Some states have betterment statutes in line w/ Somerville but generally only apply if good faith **and** when builder had color of title
      2. **Others**: trespasser cannot have advantage of any benefits they made—no compensation needed

## Public Accommodations Law

### Civil Rights Act of 1964 Title II (44)

1. Was in response to a long history of exclusion by both private citizens and the government
2. **3 steps** to see if there is a violation (but note- no damages available under Act)
   1. Applies to **Places of Public Accommodation**: debate amongst courts whether the places listed in the statute are exhaustive (majority view) or if they are simply illustrative. (most state courts with similar statutes interpret theirs as illustrative). Could make textual and congressional intent arguments both ways.
      1. Doesn’t apply to private places/ clubs: courts look if it is **selective** in its criteria & limits # of people that can join. Larger, less selective & more public oriented places will less likely qualify
         * If the selection criteria simply track the statutory categories, unlikely will be private club
      2. **Hard Case**: jewelry store that buzzes in customers- while not a private club (no membership list), still could be considered not to “serve the public” & therefore would be excluded
      3. **Hard case**: debate if membership groups like the *boy scouts* are places of public accommodation- federal courts have said no (reaching same result by internet chat rooms). Some state courts have said yes- either because they don’t have the word “place” or b/c “place” was used as convenience. Also debate if they should be considered a private club- debate on whether it was selective based on views & values. Also debate if should be protected by 1st amendment freedom of expression- See Dale (SCOTUS ruled could not require boy scouts to accept a gay member, ruling it was a social organization that espoused particular beliefs regarding homosexuality to which they hoped to instill. Dissent- nothing suggests that instilling this message was truly a goal of scouts)
   2. **Discrimination**: Courts have avoided answering if require discriminatory intent (intend to treat similarly situated people differently), or if disparate impact would be enough- broader impact on a specific racial group by the policy in place
      1. Require more than bare admission, entitled to equal treatment once admitted- violation found when restaurant made black customers pay before their order, but not whites.
      2. Hard cases are when places create exclusionary **vibes** (environment unlikely to appeal to them) or amenities (bundles products- houses & golf course- unlikely to appeal to certain group). Usually, will be permitted, but not always (especially if signs of intent).
   3. Specifically cites discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin (doesn’t mention sex)
      1. **Many state laws add sex**, economic status, marital status, etc... See NY Executive Law
      2. Debate in courts if women’s health club banning men violates the NY state statute.
      3. Debate if religious freedom should allow one to discriminate against gay weddings- arguments rely on that service provided is “expressive” (like floral arrangements or baking) and protected by 1st amendment and that not discriminatory- because not against gays, but gay marriage. Some states have passed statutes protecting shielding those religiously motivated.
3. Works through commerce clause and therefore only applies to thigs that affect commerce (or state action)
4. **Interstate Commerce Act**—**common carriers** are prohibited from all types of discrimination, not just based race, religion or national origin
5. Airbnb complaint: reservation declined when using black profile and accepted when switched to white one

### Civil Rights Act of 1886: 42 USC 1981 (45)

1. Right to “**property**” and to “**contract**:” applies only to racial discrimination (not sex, religion or national origin; held to include Jews and Arabs, which were viewed as a different race at time) but makes damages available.
2. While it clearly applies beyond state actors, unclear if only applies to purchasing property or contracting (generally in labor context), or if applies more generally to places of public accommodation; some in fact, have held it covers more places like hair salons and retail stores (if believe that Title II list is exhaustive)
   1. Interpreting it to apply to public accommodations is difficult, because then would swallow 1964 Act; but could say the Act was needed because the 1886 Act wasn’t being applied as broadly as intended
   2. There is a similar debate as to whether it should even be able to regulate private clubs
3. Most courts have held this will give you a right of entry into a retail store (and be allowed to purchase something), but that is generally it- generally other things once entered are not covered.
   1. Most courts only require you let them enter and buy, but can follow them and make them **uncomfortable**- only issued if prevented from buying something, not if deterred (minority disagree)

### American with disabilities act

1. **3 steps** to see if there is a violation:
   1. Is there a **disability**? Look to statute to see how disability defined- “Major life activities”
   2. Is it a **public accommodation**?
      1. Debate if applies to places over the phone, mail or internet, or if must be an actual physical place.
      2. **Doesn’t apply to private clubs** or religious organizations.
   3. **Is there discrimination**? Are certain criteria screening out those with disabilities and not necessary for the provision of whatever the place is providing? Could they make a reasonable modification that would not affect the fundamental nature of what they provide? Are they creating a new facility or altering an existing one without providing access to those with disabilities (and to how determinative are costs)?
      1. **Note**: disparate impact is enough, intent is not necessary
      2. **Wheelchairs and stadium seating**: debate in courts if wheelchair seating put in very front of movie theater- seats that are the last to fill up due to being so close- were in violation of the act. One court has held that at least on companion seat must be reserved next to every wheelchair seat. Debate in courts if seating must have sightlines over standing spectators at sporting events.
      3. **Historic landmarks**: are not required to make modifications if will threaten to destroy the historic significance
      4. **Hard case**: SCOTURS required PGA to allow a disabled golfer to use a golf cart between holes- was considered a reasonable modification, as the fatigue caused between walking to holes was not deemed significant enough to fundamentally alter the nature of the game
      5. **Insurance companies**: don’t need to provide benefits for mental benefits, ADA doesn’t control content or goods or services that a public accommodation offers
2. Bragdon v. Abbot:
   1. HIV in the pre-symptomatic phase is a disability because it is a physical/mental impairment. The major life activity it effects is reproduction. Therefore, they must be given access to medical care
      1. Perhaps chose reproduction, so as to not apply the holding to homosexual people
3. NYC Subway class action: lack of elevators for disabled people, embarrassing and adds inconvenience to day

### Uston case: what is the rule for facilities open to the public when the statutes at hand do not apply

1. **Uston outlier** (NJ): when property owners open their premises to public use, they cannot unreasonably exclude particular members of the public. (Couldn’t ban a card counter- wasn’t endangering anyone or violating rules)
2. **Traditional Rule** (majority): owners have the absolute right to exclude people from their property without cause, even if open for the public. Provided that **don’t violate any statutes and are not common carriers**.
   1. **Market will self-regulate**, if they exclude people for weird reasons, the market will react accordingly.
      1. Survival depends on bringing in public, they are reasonable people that will only exclude if they have reason to do so—but doesn’t want to have to prove or explain that reason- opens up to too much liability
      2. Concern: if don’t need to give reason, makes it **very hard to prove** violated discrimination prohibited by federal or state law.
   2. **Inns & Common carriers** more likely to have monopoly- can’t rely on the market to control them.
      1. They are also necessities that people often people cannot do without. And also, held themselves open to serve the public and public relies on it
      2. Unclear how valid these distinctions are from some retail stores
3. **Standards v. Rules:** NJ courts uses a standard, majority is a rule. Rules quickly settle disputes and promote transactions by identifying who owns a particular set of rights. But the rules often result in unanticipated and substantial injustice—courts often will then not mechanically apply rule but apply a standard based on intuition.

## Right to exclude and the first amendment (Public Function Doctrine)

1. To violate the 1st or 14th amendment must be a state actor. Increasing concern that as corporations take on more power & prominence and take on the role of government like actors- need more regulations imposed on them
2. **Marsh v. Alabama**- Public function doctrine- company town assumed the functions of a state government
   1. **Formulation #1 of Rule** (how it had come to be known): when a private actor steps into the role of a state actor, it is the functional equivalent of the state and should be bound like a state (**P.F doctrine**)
      1. **Signs that like a state**: physical infrastructure, officers and officials, recognition by another government entity (Here: supplied roads, sewers, sheriff, had federal post office).
   2. **Formulation #2 of Rule:** The **Public Use Standard:** more you open the property to the public the more it should be subject to regulation. Sliding scale. (In line with settled expectations).
      1. Here: it is **accessible and no visual distinction**- no barriers and near public highway, patterns of use by all types of parties
   3. Policy rational for binding state actors (and perhaps large public institutions) to the 1st amendment
      1. **Monopoly** Concern: these actors normally have a monopoly over all/ the largest gathering places in the area and therefore need to ensure they are not limiting the freedom of speech. Otherwise, people would have no practical way of being heard. Additionally, cannot trust the market to regulate when there is a monopoly
      2. **Coercive** Power: monopoly over the use of violence. Want to limit the use of that power, which can stigmatize certain thoughts simply by them being banned.
      3. **Settled expectations**: people expect to be excluded or silenced in private places, but not in the public sphere.
3. **Lloyd v. Tanner:** peacefulprotestors of the Vietnam war were kicked out of shopping center (mall)
   1. Court accepted the **Public Function Doctrine**. Largely rejected an earlier court that seemed to use the public use standard (an approach the dissent seemed to take- only place for people to be heard).
      1. Even if accepted public use- there are barriers of entry (walls) and the mall only allows some organizations to solicit costumers but bans many others. Cutting other way is that people can still freely come and go, and is the main public gathering place.
   2. **State constitutions**: some (NJ & Cal.) increase the protections for free speech closer to public use standard, requiring shopping centers or private campuses to allow persons to hand out leaflets. State is allowed to provide more protections than the federal government provides.
      1. Some have specifically found a state constitutional right to enter shopping centers seeking signatures to get politician or a referendum on the ballot
      2. But most interpret same way as federal constitution—shopping centers have power to exclude those engaging in handing out leaflets or similar speech activities
4. **NLRA:** federal statute governing relations between employees and employers provides for some rights of access for labor organizations on the employer’s property. SCOTUS has said that could be **unfair labor practice** for employer to prohibit picketers on certain areas of the property. Nonemployees may be allowed access to employer’s cafeteria or parking lot to distribute information about their union to other employees. Balance between the employer’s property rights and the employees’ rights to be free from unfair labor practices.
5. **Gun Rights on private property:** Georgie law upheld that required gun carriers to inform the owners of certain types of premises-like bars and churches- that they were carrying and follow the owner’s instructions. Court held private property owner’s right to exclude people from carrying guns on his property trumps gun-owners’ rights to carry guns where they want. Right to bear arms must be limited by the right of a property owner to exercise exclusive domain and control of his land.

## Public Trust Doctrine

1. Ensures public access to select natural resources by protecting those resources from privatization
2. 3 Part Test:
   1. **Is the property within the public domain?**
      1. Items in the public domain:
         * + Lands covered by tidal waters (Early1800s)
           + Wet-sand of the beach, for fishing and navigation (Early 1800s)
           + Lands covered by fresh waters (Illinois Central v. Illinois, 1892)
           + Wet-sand of the beach, for swimming (White v. Hughes, Fla. 1939)
           + Dry-sand of beaches (inc. recreation) owned by a municipality (Avon, N.J. 1972)
           + Dry-sand of beaches owned by a non-profit charitable association (Bay head, N.J. 1984)
           + Ambient air, wild flora, fauna (Robinson, Pa. 2013, see FN 10 in Juliana, 2016)
           + **Note:** not all courts in agreement; i.e. Massachusetts only applies doctrine to tidal waters and to non-recreational purposes)
      2. How have courts decided whether to extend the trust?
         * + Does the resource **share the same general features**/functions as an existing public trust asset? (Illinois Central v. Illinois)
           + Is the resource **necessary for the enjoyment** of an existing public trust asset and, when combined, creates a unique, irreplaceable resource that is in limited supply {and yet currently operated by a non-profit charitable association that acts as a public entity but excludes the public?} (Matthews v. Bayhead, N.J. 1972)
           + Is the resource something that has been **enjoyed for the ages** without dispute and furthers the general welfare? (White v. Hughes, 1939)
           + Juliana: look for resources that implicate the public interest that are outside the scope of purely private property. Consider what was consider **common to all by natural law**
   2. **Has the entity violated one of its fiduciary duties?**
      1. Must be held open for use by the general public (but can still charge- ***Bayhead*)**
      2. Must be maintained for particular types of uses
      3. May not be sold (***Illinois-*** can transfer if not substantial impairment to public)
         * Seems it’s a debate if state may extinguish the rights by selling it to a private owner (78)
         * (Bayhead wasn’t owned by state and no talk have sale revert back to state—maybe NJ holds can extinguish or maybe can only contest sale at time of sale by government, but entirely impractical to allow property to revert back to government at later date)
   3. **Is the title owner an entity for which a court can enforce the trust duties?**
      1. State governments (Illinois Central)
      2. Municipal governments (Avon)
      3. Quasi-public entities? (Mathews) (Court looks to whether the entity has assumed the shoes of a public organization; see Marsh to assist in analysis- public function test)
      4. Federal government? (Juliana v. U.S., D. Or. 2016)
3. **Illinois:** statecannot convey navigable waters to a private corporation
   1. Lakes were deemed a to be in the public domain through **reason by analogy:** same characteristics to open waters, high volume of commercial shipping
   2. Violation of fiduciary duties?
      1. States CAN transfer a resource in the public domain if (1) it is a small parcel of land transferred for the general **interest of the public**; (2) if there is **not a substantial impairment** to the public good (considered when resource given away not limited to a specific area)
      2. In this case, entire harbor given up and was a substantial impairment; **court considered**:
         * + Size of item given up (and the volume of commerce)
           + Purpose of resource/Nature of entity: (Entity had very little to do with the public interest at hand- railroad company owning a harbor)
           + If conveyance gave the entity an essential monopoly (even if some limits on grant)
           + Public was not in favor of this, legislature didn’t seem to be acting in their interests
   3. Dissent: grant is not unlimited, they are only allowed to do certain things and part of grant was that they couldn’t obstruct the harbor, give away the land and had to follow regulations.
4. **Matthews v. Bayhead:** from wet sand to dry sand
   1. To this point: wet sand included in public domain even for recreational purposes in NJ (wet meant sometimes covered by ocean, which mattered to fishermen back in the day).
   2. Public domain: court asks if the resource is essential to what is already included in the public domain? Is it necessary to access or enjoy? Is it unique and in limited supply? Court said need dry land to access and enjoy the wet sand & water; public has right to access and use dry sand when reasonably necessary
   3. Violated duty: they denied access to those that were not residents (still were allowed to charge though)
      1. No right to enjoy and access all property bordering the ocean, but there was no reasonable access to the sea in this case, no public beach in the area that others could enjoy.
   4. Can court enforce the trust duties? In previous NJ case ruling on dry sand, the entity was a municipality. Here, dealing with a private entity created by the local residents. Court ruled that functioning like a public entity, **quasi-public** (nonprofit, governance functions, policing beach, maintains property)
5. **Juliana:** polluting environment
   1. Court leaves open question if the atmosphere should be included in the public domain, ocean certainly is
      1. Some courts have (Robinson) and Justinian included in natural essential things
   2. Court says, contrary some other courts, no reason that doctrine shouldn’t apply to the federal government
6. **Takeaway**: courts have broadened the scope of what is included in public domain, but have limited enforcement on public or quasi-public entities
7. **Access to beaches** outside public trust doctrine:
   1. Dedication: if clear evidence of intent to dedicate the land to public use; implied dedication from a longstanding acquiescence in use of beach by public was recognized in Cal. (later overturned by statute)
   2. Prescriptive easement: if used by public for statute of limitations period and satisfies the other requirements, can be acquired by the public.
   3. Custom: longstanding, uninterrupted, peaceable, reasonable, uniform use of beachfront by the public for recreational purposes confers continuing rights of access
   4. Hawaii: unique legal system recognizing public access to all beaches up to the vegetation line

# unit three: Privilege to use

## Nuisance:

1. A **nuisance** is a substantial and unreasonable interference with the use or enjoyment of land
   1. Balance between protecting a right to freely **use** property and **securing** a right to **enjoy** one’s property. Courts will determine who is entitled to cause harm and be secured of harm
      1. Free use promotes the desired flexibility to build and create new things on land, while secure use and enjoyment tries to limit that development to some extent to promote stability
      2. Approaching cases from baseline of freedom of use or freedom of security will affect outcomes
   2. Not trespass: trespass protects the interest of **exclusive possession**, while nuisance protects interests in **use or enjoyment** of one’s property (some courts focus on direct/indirect harm or unseen particles)
      1. Nuisance: must show substantial and unreasonable interference, as courts are trying to balance two competing property interests.
      2. Trespass: no required showing of harm- one person is infringing on the property rights of another
      3. **Johnson v. Paynesville:** condemns the trend to include particles in trespass law-would either lead to strict liability for even particles or for requiring harm for trespass- both results bad.
   3. Not negligence: courts not concerned with whether the conduct was reasonable, but rather with the “state of affairs”- the harm is deemed unreasonable if it’s one that the plaintiff personally shouldn’t need to bear
      1. Negligence is purely about cost/benefit to society of conduct; nuisance considers **many factors** in determining whether it is reasonable that the specific person should bear the costs
      2. Technically require that D “knew or should have known harm would occur”- though courts often find liability even if D couldn’t have foreseen the harm (seems just require that what occurred was within the range of reasonable possibilities- which excludes unusually sensitive P’s)
2. **Test**: how does the court decide if the it is reasonable to make the P bear the consequences of D’s actions
   1. **Is the interest within the right to the “use and enjoyment of land”?**
      1. Pollution, noise, odors, smoke, excessive lights, encroaching trees, vibrations, water…
         * Traditionally purely **visual** annoyances were not covered, but modern trend accepts
      2. Light and Air: **majority**- no interest in light (Fontainebleau-shading pool and blocking view); **minority** approach- should be no different than any other claim, nuisances can change over time
         * Many courts agree that if done maliciously- “spite fences”- then will be enforced
         * Cal. Statute: if tree planted after neighbor installs solar collector, cannot allow it to block more than 10% of the absorption area from 10AM-2PM
      3. Other cases:
         * Generally **included**: “Crack house”- landlords who let their property used by drug dealers (owner must take reasonable steps to try and stop the activity, even if not participating); large displays of Christmas lights that bring in large crowds to residential neighborhoods
         * Generally, **not included**: stigma damages to property value from being near toxic waste dumps (but will allow if actual property previously contaminated and stigma remains)
         * Contested: preventing dangers from purely natural conditions like landslides, anticipatory nuisances, apartment buildings in residential area (if no relevant zoning law), Airbnb
   2. **Is the harm substantial?**
      1. What is the **extent** of the harm?
         * Unusually sensitive plaintiffs will generally not prevail—nuisance law protects reasonable interests in use and enjoyment of land
      2. What is the **character** of the harm? (Health and safety more concerning than aesthetic harms)
         * Even w/ modern trend, less likely to grant for purely visual harms—reluctant to grant on mere difference of taste & more likely if malice or spite is present
   3. **Is the harm unreasonable?** Does D’s conduct create consequences that a typical landowner should not be expected to bear? (considers both fairness and efficiency in rewarding the entitlement)
      1. What is the **economic** or **social** value of the conflicting activities?
      2. Fault: Are the conflicting activities **suitable** for the location? Is one party engaged in a **disfavored** activity? Did P **come** to the nuisance?
         * Some states make it an absolute defense if P came to the nuisance in certain cases, but generally will just weigh in favor of D (see remedies on how solution may change if still a nuisance)
         * **Right to farm:** many states protect farmers from nuisance liability if farming started before the surrounding residents were built (one court found this unconstitutional)
      3. The ability of either party to **avoid the conflict** and the practicability and fairness of making either party avoid the conflict?
         * Who is the **cheapest cost avoider**?
         * **Distributive**: is it fair to make the P bear the costs of D’s socially desirable activity or should the costs be spread to the owner (who will spread them to his customers)
      4. Additional considerations:
         * **Incentives**: how will the ruling incentivize investment in safety or in desirable economic activities
         * Is their **malice** at play?
3. **Notes:**
   1. **Strict Liability:** if engaged in an ultrahazardous activity.
   2. **Nuisance per se**: properties used for prostitution, illegal gambling or manufacturing drugs
   3. **Materially participated in causing the harm:** can sue anyone whose conduct was a substantial factor in causing the harm—sometimes including manufacturers and distributors
   4. **Anticipatory nuisance doctrine:** can only get an injunction again use not yet in place if it is a near certainty that the use will constitute a nuisance
   5. **Statute of limitations:** must sue before statute of limitation expires. For permanent nuisances- irreparably injures P’s property or will continue indefinitely- clock starts when nuisance starts. For temporary nuisances—intermittent or can be alleviated by changes in D’s conduct—clock starts anew each time
   6. **Public nuisance:** unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public-traditionally could only be brought by public officials, modern approach allows anyone affected by the harm to bring suit
      1. Federal environmental law preempted a climate change challenge against electric utilities, but SCOTUS left open the possibility of state law allowing for the nuisance claims
4. **Dobbs v. Wiggins:** court found a nuisance were a man created a dog kennel and interfered with his neighbor’s enjoyment of their land
   1. Barking was noise interfering with enjoyment of land, harm was substantial- couldn’t spent time outside and had to leave windows closed and was deemed unreasonable- P’s were not unduly sensitive
   2. But court left it for trial court to determine how many dogs were reasonable
5. **Armstrong v. Francis Corp: Surface water**
   1. Changing the natural course of surface water has gotten special treatment by the courts; 3 approaches
   2. **Reasonable use test** (Armstrong- **Majority**): consider the purpose or motives of the D, the amount of harm and the subsequent harm moving forward, relation of action to greater social good, mitigating measures available to both parties (mentions foreseeability, but does not discuss in usual fashion)
      1. Here: purpose was to create for profit housing, the increase in water caused water pollution and harm to structures (will get worse with time, especially considering more future developments), the social good is a balance between preserving isolated homes and promoting building of houses
      2. If there is substantial harm, reasonable use test likely to hold D liable even if his activity far outweighs the social utility of P’s land use (separate question if P limited to damages or even an injunction)
   3. **Common Enemy:** freedom of action/use within property to remove all water. Modified to control for substantial harm caused by artificially induced discharges of water
   4. **Natural flow:** Strict liability, owners cannot discharge water artificially; freedom of security of your property. Generally modified to allow for expulsion if harm not substantial or unreasonable
      1. Some limit the doctrine just to rural and not urban settings
6. Building claims for one side or another based on public policy (balance efficiency/fairness and use/security)
   1. Different approaches over time:
      1. **In past**- substantial harm was automatically a nuisance; this idea was furthered in progressive era (postindustrial)- make the company **internalize** the costs on society
      2. **Industrial America**- wanted people to build and use their land- focused on harm that was unreasonable
      3. **Coase**: not about one harming the other, but conflicting uses-question is simply which use is most valuable
   2. **Boomer** as a case study:
      1. Classical arguments: factory is doing harm and should pay for and thereby internalize the external harms its operation causes
      2. Coase: D isn’t solely causing harm, reciprocal harms- houses encroaching on D (reframing issue)- there are joint costs, unclear who should internalize the costs they are imposing on each other
         * Should have **bright line**/absolute rule—lets parties **negotiate** and facilitates market activity, reasonableness standard will lead to uncertainty and transaction costs
         * Goal of social welfare is to allocate the entitlement to the person that **values it most** with as little transaction costs as possible
         * **Initial entitlement doesn’t matter**—perhaps best rule would be rule of no nuisance: will be clear to parties that courts will do nothing, and they will negotiate for most valuable use—will always be efficient (no nuisance particularly effective, no need for courts at all)
      3. Counter:
         * Not truly reciprocal harms- homeowners not “doing” anything
         * **Transaction costs are high, and bargaining is unrealistic**: the offer the parties would make is different than what they would demand to sell because of declining marginal utility of money, endowment effect (value what you have more), lack of ability to pay (especially problematic if see the initial distribution of wealth as unjust), and issues of collective action. If factory granted entitlement-would have large advantage.
           + When have many different parties or in a bilateral monopoly (Fontainebleau) transaction costs tend to be higher
           + Type of transaction costs: bargaining costs, holdouts- hold out for more money on wrongful assumption that other party will pay more, free riders- drives offer price down because others won’t contribute as they assume others will pay the costs, administrative costs and agency costs (hiring others to carry out a task)
           + Prioritarian standard: attempts to correct for the effects distribution of wealth has on ability to pay by weighing the interest of those worse off more highly when determining who to grant an entitlement/which use is most efficient
           + **In short**: gaps of asking and offer price will be affected by practical constraints, wealth effects, transaction costs and the endowment effect. Even if no gap- high transaction costs could prevent parties from arriving at the efficient result
         * Just as important as efficiency is **distributive justice** (fairness)- who should fairly bear the costs. Perhaps have bright line rule requiring companies to internalize costs protecting the security of people (Note: likely less conducive to bargaining than bright line no nuisance rule- would still require court intervention to declare something as a nuisance)
           + Also **note Radin**: some things are above being traded on the market, and should be discussed in context of justice and rights—not wealth and efficiency
7. **Remedies**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Remedy | **Plaintiff’s Entitlement** | **Defendant’s Entitlement** |
| **Property Rule** Preferable if **low** transaction costs; bargains will take place  Good for **complex** issues that court cannot value, leaves it to the parties | Injunction  P can get an injunction forcing D to stop the harmful conduct  D may continue to commit the harm provided D offers P enough money to induce P to give up P’s right to be from harm.  Proper when harm is **substantial**, and the **social costs outweigh the benefits** | No Nuisance  D has an entitlement to commit the harm without liability.  P may prevent the harm, provided P offers D enough money to induce D to agree to stop the harmful conduct.  Proper when harm **isn’t substantial**, or type of harm is socially **beneficial** & **reasonable** to impose on P as a member of society |
| **Liability Rule**  Preferable if **high** transaction costs  Good for situations that the court can **accurately** value | Damages  P can get damages from D for committing the harm, but no injunction.  D may continue to commit the harm, as long as D pays P the amount decided by the court  Proper when harm is **substantial** and unduly burdensome for P, but the **social benefits outweigh the costs** | Purchased Injunction  P can stop D’s conduct if P is willing to pay damages as determined by a court to compensate D for D’s loss of profits.  Proper when the overall harm of the activity **outweighs the benefits**, but the harm of the injunction **to D would be substantial** and unfairly burdensome |

* 1. See the struggle of the court here to find the correct system. Originally harm done- nuisance granted. With rise of industrialization- cannot shut down big entities that provide a large social benefit and therefore ruled no nuisance.
  2. Middle ground (**Boomer**): recognize that an entity has a net social benefit but is unreasonable as between the parties, and therefore allow D to continue to move forward but requires D to feel some of the external costs that they are producing.
     1. Purchased injunction is opposite: recognizes that harms outweigh the benefits to society, but those that are benefiting from the cessation of the activity are thought to be the ones that should bear the costs associated with shutting it down (Ranch owners case)
     2. (**Note:** if transaction costs are low, then need for the liability rule is lessoned, because the parties will easily bargain to a relatively similar result anyways if keep entitlement the same)

## Express Easements

1. Easement: when an owner grants a person or a landowner the right to use a part of his land (for certain purposes)
   1. **Affirmative easement**: the right to do something on someone’s land (Restrictive Covenants or negative easements: restricts what one can do with their land)
      1. Most common is “*Right of way*.” Another type is “*profit*”—collect resources from the land
   2. **Appurtenant**: the benefit runs with the dominant estate and the burden runs with the servient estate, applies only to the specific parcels of land; burden and benefit will run with the land to future owners
      1. Appurtenant easement **cannot be severed**, only runs w/ land—cannot sell land and retain easement or keep land and sell easement
      2. (In theory, can have easement appurtenant where the benefit runs with the land, but the burden does not)
   3. **Gross**: burden runs with servient estate while the benefit runs with a specific person instead of land (there is no dominant estate)
      1. Traditionally could not transfer easements in gross, **modern trend is to allow** one to grant their easement to someone else (though courts are hesitant if personal and not commercial in nature—like swimming in a private lake). Easements in profits were always presumed to be alienable.
2. **Requirements for an express easement:**
   1. **In writing**: to comply with statute of frauds, generally found in deed- only needs to appear in 1 document
      1. Must sufficiently describe the easement and the grantee
   2. **Notice** (to subsequent owners of servient estate): either **actual** notice; **constructive**- the easement is written within the deed or the chain of title of previous deeds-a reasonable buyer would do a title search; **inquiry**- visible signs of use by non-owners that would cause a reasonable owner to enquire about an easement
   3. **Intent of original parties**- did the granter intend for the burden to run with the land, did they intend for it to run in gross or appurtenant, what uses were to be included (look to writings, circumstances and policy)
      1. **Presumption in favor of appurtenant** easement over easements in gross: limits the number of easements freeing the land from excessive burdens; also, easy to find the owner of the benefit to purchase it back (gross interferes with alienability of property)
3. **Green v. Lupo:** P granted D an easement of a road between their properties, but began blocking it when **mobile home tenants** on D’s property starting using it with their motorcycles causing a raucous
   1. Question was whether the easement was in gross (only giving right to D) or appurtenant-giving right of way to anyone with a property interest of D’s property
      1. **Writing**: language was **unclear**- named people (and not heirs) which made it seem in gross, but mentioned ingress and egress- which is a type that makes it seem attached to the land (see below)
      2. **Circumstances**- look at the situation of the property and the parties at the time of easement or to the conduct of the parties to determine how they viewed it
         * **Pro Appurtenant**: the easement has **no value apart from ownership** of the dominant estate (or especially valuable to owner of dominant estate): present here- ingress & egress
         * **Pro Gross**: if the benefit is one that would be useful or commercially marketable **apart from ownership** of nearby land- not present here (would apply be utilities)
      3. Conclusion: meant to be appurtenant, but court remanded to lower court to determine if excessive motorcycle use was causing an undue burden
4. **Cox v. Glenbrook:** years ago, P granted D the right of way through a **one lane road** on P’s property to reach D’s single-family residence (D now wants to widen the road to make it accessible for a housing development)
   1. Question is how much the use at the time should limit the use of the easement today (clearly appurtenant)
      1. Court says cannot restrict the use to that particular time- by attaching to the land anyone with land ownership can benefit, **even if land split up**, all successors have right (unless explicit restriction)
         * But the court stated that it is possible that this would cause an **undue burden**, but that wouldn’t be clear until the development was built
      2. But: the deed seems to intend that the road **remains one lane**, and therefore cannot widen it (though can maintain and improve it to promote its use)
   2. Note: the developer likely values the use more now, so according to Coase it doesn’t really matter to an efficiency standpoint who the court rules with because the developer will **bargain** for the right anyways
5. **Central Cable Television Co. V. Cook**
   1. Question #1: does an easement to lay electric wires include an easement to install television cables
      1. **Majority**: won’t limit use to the state of technology at the time without specific intent, tv wires are close enough to general electrical wires
      2. “Absent clear evidence of parties’ intent, use of an easement may change over time to take advantage of developments in technology and accommodate **normal development** of benefited party so long as it does not unreasonably burden the servient estate”—3rd Restatement
   2. Question #2: can one that has a gross easement apportion use of that easement to a third party?
      1. **Exclusive use**: can apportion it, original owner has no right to use it or grant other easements and therefore. Present in this case- owner never intended to use it.
      2. **Non-Exclusive use**: then not apportionable because the granter can grant easements to others
      3. **Restatement**: intent of parties- allowed unless contrary intent or would burden the servient estate
6. **Summary:** 2 types of rules (3rd type of substantive restrictions more relevant by negative covenants)
   1. **Procedural rules**: require that it be in writing and that there is notice to future owners of burdened estate
   2. **Interpretative rules** to determine the intent of the parties (**scope** of the easement)
      1. To determine if easement in **appurtenant or gross**: look at language, circumstances of the easement and consider that easements in appurtenant are normally preferred (*Lupo)*
      2. What **kind of use** was contemplated by the grantor? (*Cable,* kind of Cox*)*
      3. **Unreasonable burden**-quantity or intensity of activity might not be in line with what original grantor intended (See *Lupo*, *Cox)*
         * Balance of freedom of development and freedom of security
      4. **Subdivision** of easement: for **appurtenant** the benefits will run with the subdivided lands (cox), for **gross**- question of exclusivity or intent (see Cable)
7. **Notes:**
   1. **Changing location** of the easement: traditional rules prevents this; modern trend is to allow for reasonable changes in the location or dimensions of an easement at the servient owner’s expense that don’t significantly lessen the utility of the easement, don’t increase the burdens on the owner of the easement in its use and don’t frustrate the purpose for which it was granted. Other courts allow for changes if damages are paid to the easement owner
   2. **Extension of use**: if granted right of way to access dominant estate and then buy another property on the other side of dominant estate, most courts prohibit the extension of use to that estate absent intent indicating otherwise
8. **Policy points relevant here:**
   1. **Balance of freedom of development and freedom of security**- will affect if read kind intended broadly or narrowly and whether think there is an unreasonable burden
   2. **Stability v. Change**: how should courts view the changing circumstances and apply them to the easement at hand
   3. **Autonomy and efficiency**: allow owners to tailor the use of their land, secure expectations which will encourage investment and alienation in land. Will allocate resources to those that value it most and alienability will further autonomy, allowing an owner to move on from the land.
   4. **Fear or burdening land**: useless restrictions, violation of broader public policy goals, unfair surprise and undermine expectations of new purchasers

## Implicit Easements

1. **Easement by prescription—**see above
2. **Easement by estoppel**:
   1. 4 Elements
      1. **Permission** from owner to use the land
      2. **Foreseeable and reasonable** (***Taylor***-was it expected, intended or necessary) reliance on the continuation of the permission
      3. **Changed position** by the claimant (usually through significant expenditures) in reliance
      4. Easement is necessary to **prevent injustice**
   2. **3 different circumstances**: intended to create easement but didn’t comply with statute of frauds; fraud and misrepresentation; and even in cases where simply reasonable reliance on continuation of consent
      1. Some will limit the doctrine just to cases of fraud
   3. Meant to protects owners the relied on the land and ensure that land use in most valuable capacity (generally understood as applying to protect the grantee even if the intent of the grantor was otherwise)
   4. **Constructive trust:** if legal title is obtained by someone under fraud, misrepresentation, or in a way that takes advantages of ones necessities they may have a beneficial interest in the property removed (See case where purchaser acquired property aware of the existence of semi-permanent cabins used under a lease of the property for 50 years—wasn’t allowed to terminate their leases right away, had to give them 15 years)
   5. **Lobato v. Taylor:** claiming an easement (**profit**) to enter into the land and collect timber, firewood, fish
      1. Not an express easement: writing was insufficiently described the easement and the grantees
      2. **Perspective easement**: although they had permission from the owner to be there (non-adverse), the court ruled that a defective deed made it inherently adverse (relied on property right they didn’t have, weren’t relying on the permission)
      3. **Easement be estoppel**:
         * They had **permission & their reliance was reasonable** b/c it was necessary to heat and build homes and grazing was needed for livestock, was intended as seen in the deed and practices and was expected based on the Mexican system that this was meant to embody.
         * **Substantial reliance** in that they moved to this land specifically because for this benefit and they traveled 100’s of miles relying on the owner’s representations making an easement necessary for justice
      4. **Easement by prior use**: they were previously one parcel of land and prior to the **split** the inhabitants relied on the benefits prior to split; the benefit is also needed to enjoy the land
      5. On question of scope of the easement
         * Rights to what’s in the document- pasture, timber and firewood; limited to reasonable use
         * Concurrence: fishing, hunting and recreation should be included as well, as those are rights they have enjoyed (perhaps majority felt wasn’t intent or wasn’t necessary)
      6. Aftermath: created a tragedy of the commons, nobody wanted to take responsibility for the land
         * The new owner tried to negotiate with inhabitants- the type we would expect to see to reach an efficient result- but the inhabitants felt lowballed and insulted by the offer
           + **Radin argument**: land is wrapped up in their very being, more valuable than the market can calculate
3. **Easement implied by prior use:**
   1. 3 Elements:
      1. **Two parcels** were previously owned by a common grantor
      2. One parcel was used for the **benefit of the other parcel** in a manner that was apparent and continuous
         * 3rd restatement: underground sewer or utility lines that are not visible may qualify
      3. The use is **reasonably necessary** or highly convenient for enjoyment of the dominant estate
         * Did the parties have **reason to expect** the use would continue despite severance of the parcel? Was it sufficiently **apparent** and significant that they likely would have believed it was part of the bargain?
   2. **Granite Properties v. Mann:** sold piece of property that contained within it the **driveways** needed to access the parking lot for the apartment building they owned & the back of their supermarket (for trucks)
      1. No explicit easement, no prescriptive easement- didn’t satisfy statute of limitations, no easement by estoppel- no permission and didn’t change actions, no easement by necessity- not actually landlocked
      2. Easement by prior use:
         * Distinction between **easement by reservation** (grantor tries to seek an easement) and **easement by grant** (receiver seeking the easement with the acquisition of property). Higher standard of proof of necessity element for the conveyor than the conveyee- less likely to recognize easement by reservation. Want to encourage the granters to be clear and complete when selling a piece of land
         * But still, only tilts scales- still doesn’t need to be absolutely necessary, just reasonably so.
           + Especially when prior use was so obvious and apparent- will require even less necessity (could think of as **sliding scale**)
      3. The 3 elements (court uses 8 factors) are a proxy for what the parties likely intended. In case at hand reasonably apparent and necessary and likely intended to keep the driveways
4. **Easement by necessity:**
   1. 2 Elements: **Formally one parcel of land** and at the time of severance the dominant estate became **landlocked** (necessity at time of severance)
   2. **Fin v. Williams:** claim is that because at time of sale the landlocked estate could enter and exit the property through neighbors’ land there was no necessity at the time and therefore couldn’t require a right of way now (Argument is that it is like an unexpected natural event that closed routes of access later on)
      1. **Holding:** not like natural event, could expect that permission granted from neighboring strangers land would be revoked in the future; was necessary at time because became landlocked and had no actual right to exit and enter the property through other roads.
   3. Goals of doctrine is to effectuate the intent of the parties and promote the efficient use of the property- split in courts when intent was clearly not to grant permission, but it’s necessary
      1. Some states have statutes that allow owners of landlocked parcels to use neighbors land to get to a public road through application to a public official & compensating the burdened estate

## Modifying and terminating Easements

1. Easements last forever unless they are terminated by (1) agreement in writing; (2) by their own terms; (3) by merger- holder of servient estate buys the dominant; (4) by abandonment- if conduct indicated an intent to abandon; (5) by adverse possession or prescription by the owner or a third party;
2. (6) frustration of purpose- purpose of the easement has become impossible to accomplish or no longer serves its intended purpose.
   1. Third restatement suggests permitting modification when it would permit accomplishment of the purpose of the easement, but few courts have adopted this
3. Some states have enacted marketable title acts that require easement and other encumbrances to be re-recorded periodically (30-50 years) to be binding on future purchasers

## Intro to Covenants:

1. Restricts one ability to do certain things with their land, though they can be affirmative as well—in that they require someone to do something with their land for the benefit of others.
   1. A robust mechanism for land planning; more effective than contract because the burden runs with the land
   2. Substantive Restraints- traditionally courts were particularly concerned w/ covenants: 1) fear that would saddle properties with restrictions that would harm the efficient use of land 2) harder to see than easements—fear of lack of notice to future owners
2. **Real Covenants:**
   1. **In writing**-need not be repeated in subsequent transfers of property
      1. Can also formalize a **declaration** that applies to the entire subdivision; most courts don’t require that anything appear when individual lots sold, while some require reference to the declaration
      2. Sometimes won’t be listed in deed or official declaration but refer to the covenants in a **plat or map** of the proposed subdivision- courts hesitant unless clear on extent and nature of restrictions.
      3. Courts will sometimes grant covenants by estoppel if fraudulent promise induced reliance (rare)
   2. **Notice:** purchaser of the property must have notice of the covenant when acquiring the servient estate
      1. (1) Actual notice; (2) Constructive notice- because it is the chain of title or in a declaration; (3) Inquiry notice- conditions on the property that indicate that it is so encumbered would make a reasonable purchaser inquire about the existence of a covenant
      2. Inquiry notice is rare for covenants, as they aren’t noticeable like easements. Though some courts have ruled that the **uniform nature of surrounding houses** places a buyer on notice of the potential presence of common plan (See *Sanborn*)
         * Other courts find **constructive notice for the general plan** not due to uniform nature of land, but rather because buyers are required to research deeds to neighboring parcels if they were all once owned by a single prior grantor (Roper-587)
           + Even if no common plan yet established, if grantor **promised** the previous purchaser to sell the land under certain conditions/ not for certain purposes, majority will bind future purchasers through constructive notice (Sanborn and Roper work **even when not explicit promise/declaration made**-a certain amount of properties containing the covenant will create an implied reciprocal servitude—see later)
         * Still others hold that purchasers are only bound by those restrictions **appearing in the chain of title** for the burdened property itself (see Riley)
   3. Grantor **intended** for burden to run with land and bind the promisor’s successor
      1. Generally, if meets the touch and concern test/ benefits some land will presume meant to run with the land even if no explicit language indicating as such (others require clear intent)
   4. **Privity of Estate**:
      1. **Horizontal privity**: looks to relationship between the original contracting parties; looking for one piece to be burdened in benefit of the other
         * **Simultaneous privity**: people had same interest, in the same land, at the same time. (restricted sellers of land from making covenants, only landlord-tenants could)
         * **Instantaneous privity**: covenant is valid between buyer and seller if instituted at the moment of sale- fleeting moment of shared interest. (precludes covenants made after sale or between neighbors generally)
      2. **Vertical privity**: i.e. grantor formally transfers interest (applies to benefited/burdened land)
         * **Strict VP:** no VP if grantor leases the property- original owner of land cannot retain an interest in the piece of land at issue (can sue the leaser, but not the lessee)
         * **Relaxed VP**: VP present even if only a lease- could sue the leaser and the lessee
   5. **Touch and concern test** (substantive test): burden the use or enjoyment of one land for the benefit of increased enjoyment or market value of the other. Both burden and benefit must touch and concern some land, no gross- unless held by government or non-profit
      1. Done to ensure that estates weren’t burdened in an inefficient way
      2. Note: the first 4 are all formal requirements- regulate how the right is created & meant to ensure parties communicate their intentions clearly, this final element is a substantive one—limits the ability of individuals to create certain rights no matter the planning
3. **Law of equitable servitudes and the third restatement**
   1. Both still keep the in writing, intent to run with land and notice requirements
   2. **Equitable servitudes**
      1. Did away with the privity requirement entirely- **notice** is enough (enforcer must be intended beneficiary of covenant)
      2. **Kept** the touch and concern element
   3. Restatement: attempt to abolish the distinction between the two types
      1. **Did away with privity**- notice is enough (but affirmative covenants will only run if it makes sense for the party to perform; both tenants and landowner can enforce if applicable)
         * Protect purchasers from surprise; affirmative obligations only transfer when a reasonable person would have assumed would attach
      2. **Removed the touch and concern** element- enforceable unless an unreasonable burden on land use; presumption of validity. Covenants in gross permitted if person is identifiable and has legitimate interest
         * **Burden on challenger** to show violation of public policy because: arbitrary, capricious, restrains alienation & trade, burdens fundamental constitutional right, or unconscionable
         * More **flexible** while protecting the original policy concern: protect value of land
      3. Covenants should be interpreted to further the intent of the parties, carry out their purpose and avoid violating public policy
         * Modern shift recognizing that these might **enhance value**—traditionally narrowly construed to be least burdensome to the free use of the land
   4. **Traditionally**: equitable servitudes—injunctive relief; real servitudes—damages. Modern courts generally have one system in some combination of restatement and traditional rules, some have both.
4. **Neponsit v. Emigrant Savings:** Realty group required each house owner to pay maintenance fee to maintain the parks, beaches and roads. Homeowner foreclosed and taken over by bank- they are suing for the money
   1. Two issues relating to real covenants:
      1. **Touch and concern of the land**- does a payment fee concern the land? Yes— payment is a burden to maintain the common land that all the residents share and wish to benefit from
      2. **Privity**- the homeowners association didn’t technically possess the benefit. But, courts said that the association is a representative body of the community and therefore it is standing in for the interests of the owners.

## Covenants: A Common Plan

1. **Implied Reciprocal Negative Easement:** when an owner sells a number of parcels with evidence of intent to create a common plan of development then (1) covenants made to the seller benefit all parcels within the plan and (2) all parcels within the plan are bound by the covenant.
   1. This makes it **binding on all parcels and allows all owners to sue to enforce the covenant**.
   2. Many states now require that developers file a declaration prior to the selling of individual lots
2. **Sanborn v. Mclean:** purchaser tried to build gas station in backyard in an area where most of the properties were bound by a covenant restricting their properties to residential purposes but there was no declaration and no restriction appeared in his chain of title (and grantor made no promise to restrict the remaining lots). Buyer was told by seller that land wasn’t restricted
   1. **Holding:** purchaser is to be bound through an implied reciprocal negative easement—had constructive notice because was included in many of the surroundings properties sold by same developer and had inquiry notice due to the uniformity of the properties
      1. Court made this ruling even though while a majority of houses had the covenant in their deeds, a super majority did not—not certain would inquire from the right people (**53 of 91**)
         * How many need to be sold w/o the restriction to indicate that there is no common scheme? Perhaps that existed for 30 years played an important role for the court here
   2. Had he known about it and orally promised to comply-equitable estoppel might have applied
3. **Riley v. Bear:** question whether purchasers should be bound by a restrictive covenant that was not mentioned in their deed and was prior to the declaration—they want to build a snow tunnel
   1. Representation by seller that would be subject to restriction, though was mistakenly not put into the deed
   2. Even though buyers subsequent to the purchase were clearly bound by the restrictions, the court found that a lot cannot be restricted if the restrictions don’t appear in the chain of title to that particular lot
      1. Court disallowed the oral evidence that showed they knew of the grantor’s intent to enforce restrictions, relying on statute of frauds
      2. The dissent said that this can’t stand, they knew this at the time and then ignored it anyways- would hurt the value to the community as a whole as they subdivide their land
   3. Later California case clarified Riley: reciprocal covenants will only be enforced if in the chain of title or the developer records a declaration prior to the sale of the properties sought to be burdened and benefited by them
4. **Common plan** can be shown by various factors: presence of restrictions in all or most deeds to the property in the area, a recorded map showing the restrictions, the presence of the restrictions in the last deed (if not to benefit owner, presumed to be benefiting the other landowners), observance by owners of similar development of their land and conformity to the written restrictions, language stating that the covenants are intended to run with the land and the recording of a declaration stating that the covenants are intended to be mutually enforceable.
   1. Evidence pointing the other way: some deeds unrestricted and the restrictions are not uniform
   2. But- Riley & later Cal. court: reject “implied” reciprocal covenants, must be in deed/declaration
5. **Evans v. Pollock:**
   1. Applied doctrine of implied reciprocal easements and concluded that while there was a general plan, that plan was **limited to certain well-defined similarly situated lots** and therefore did not apply to the hilltop property, but did apply to the unrestricted seafront property
      1. Hard case: could have gone either way- hilltop lot was closely and centrally located
6. **Lots retained by developer:** can a developer build on his land that is directly across from the restricted subdivision in a manner inconsistent with the restrictions imposed on the subdivision? Most courts hold that only parcels w/n the common scheme are restricted and therefore will not be bound unless was described in the plat, declaration or orally as part of the development.
7. **Apple v. Presley:** common interest development- relationship between unit owner and developer
   1. Developer tried to remove nine lots from the effects of the restrictive covenant
   2. General notes on **Developer control:** many states require a developer to turn over control to the residents once 75% of the units are sold or two years after units stop being solid in the ordinary course of business
      1. Some use the period of control to arrange for management contracts in which the association agrees to pay the developer in exchange for services. A federal act allows for a 2/3 to terminate the contracts of more than three years entered into while the developer had majority control
      2. Once a developer sells all the parcels, even if the declaration allows for it, most courts apply a strong presumption against continued enforcement by the absentee developer. If in declaration, some allow it, at least where the owners have the power to amend the declaration & there is no showing that the developer retained unreasonable control over the owners after completing it.
      3. More than 50% of states ban private transfer fees paid to the developer when the property is sold
   3. Apple: Developers can only make **reasonable changes** even when kept the right to amend the terms of a restrictive covenant—otherwise would undo the whole purpose of the covenant (couldn’t be relied on)
      1. Third Restatement: A developer may not exercise a power to amend the declaration in a way that would **materially change** the character of the development or the burdens on the existing members unless the declaration fairly apprises purchasers that the power could be used for the kind of change proposed (not the same as reasonableness test)
      2. **Some courts** say the language allowing to amend enables the developer to make **any** changes

## Covenants: Substantive Limits

1. Modern trend is to limit covenants not through touch and concern test, but one of **reasonableness**
2. **Davidson v. Katz**: Katz agreed not to build a supermarket for 40 years because Davidson had a **supermarket** nearby. Katz sold to NB housing authority who leased the property to a supermarket chain
   1. Originally wanted injunctive relief, but then Davidson closed store, so asked for damages for lost sales and lost value of the supermarket that he sold
      1. Traditionally damages would be governed by Real Covenants- that formalism has fallen away, damages decided case by case when needed
   2. Analysis under traditional rules of Real Covenants: Davidson wins
      1. Was in writing and subsequent parties had constructive notice minimally
      2. Horizontal Privity: if follow instantons privity- met between Katz and Davidson
      3. Vertica Privity: certainly, with NB housing, would also have with the supermarket chain if followed relaxed vertical privity standard (clearly no claim against Katz, prior owners not responsible)
      4. Intent: Deed said would run with the land and presumption of intent when the benefit is attached to the land
      5. Touch and concern the land: likely satisfied as it burdens the land in benefit of another (though questionable because the land is two miles away)
   3. Trial Court used a version of equitable/3rd restatement- **reasonableness test** w/ touch and concern as 1 element- **Davidson loses**: Unreasonable length, unreasonable restraint on trade and against public policy
      1. Court of Appeals affirms: mostly because would be “so contrary to public policy”
      2. **Rehabilitation of urban and inner cities is a public policy and interest of the state**:
         * Used public documents as a way of proving interest of public at play: studies by a public by a body, congressional reports, testimony from mayor and expert on food marketing
         * Economic decay: will lose other types of stores as well, besides for losing healthy and cheaper foods. Will hurt minorities and women with children at home
         * Balances the public policy with the Davidsons interest and found specifically that here the land at issue was the only reasonable place for a supermarket
   4. Which outcome is better?
      1. Pro Davidson: (1) protect reliance interest of Davidson—settled expectations; (2) protect confidence in market; (3) autonomy to make their own decisions and make plans—freedom of contract; (4) market will correct and fill needs when needed
      2. Anti-Davidson: (1) Major public policy issue at hand—evidence shows the seriousness of issue (2) Use the land for its most efficient purpose; (3) distinct land that is absolutely necessary for the community
3. **Nahrstedt v. Lakeside Village Condominium:** Condominium complex had a **no pet policy**. Condo owner brings a claim asking for injunctive relief as applied to indoor cats that stay in home
   1. State statute: condominium rules enforceable **unless unreasonable** (court will evaluate through principles of equitable servitudes)
   2. Distinguished between two of use categories
      1. Use restrictions set forth in the declaration or the master deed- **presumption of validity** and should be upheld even if they exhibit some degree of unreasonableness—overturned only if arbitrary, violate public policy or burden outweighs benefit to affected land
         * Also applies to later amendments to the declaration
         * Different approach than Davidson court, not just adding to test, but strong presumption of validity
      2. Use restrictions promulgated by the **governing board**- simple reasonableness test; fetter their discretion to some degree when trying to implement rules that didn’t apply originally
   3. **Holding**: animals effect health and sanitation—therefore not arbitrary and cannot overcome policy in original deed (doesn’t get much into the public policy issues that may be at play)
      1. **Court will not look to individual cases**- rules will be enforced uniformly across complex if valid
      2. Social fabric is dependent upon **written documents** being given strong and consistent effect
   4. **Dissent**: arbitrary and unreasonable—pets play an important role in many people’s lives (public policy concern), unnecessary for the policy to be universally applied to those that can keep their pets indoors
      1. Dissent focused on **individual**, while majority focuses on community that came together to live by common rules—need to trust their representatives, can’t let the few undermine the structure
      2. Dissent: doesn’t like the deference the majority shows to written documents
4. **Neuman v. Grandview:** Board modified the restrictions to restrict the use of the common area of prayer services
   1. **Reasonableness** standard in the statute: bylaws and other board actions must be reasonable and within the scope of authority reasonably created by the declaration
      1. Scope of authority will be affected by whether interpret covenants in favor of free use of land or to achieve intent of parties
      2. Some courts apply the **Business judgement rule** in determining the validity of a board’s actions**:** **process** employed simply must have been rational or in good faith
         * Using general standard of reasonableness allows for too much intervention by the courts
   2. Plaintiff argued that the right of assembly (mentioned in statute) was being unreasonably interfered with
   3. Court: this restriction doesn’t stop all assembly, it just stops types of assembly; right of assembly generally for speaking about public affairs, even if for other things- doesn’t have to include services
      1. Didn’t do deep dive into the particular interest of the those that held services there
   4. **Notes**:
      1. Congress passed an act that guarantees the right to fly the American Flag on one’s property, regardless of the condominium/homeowner association rules (oddly- doesn’t apply to tenants)
      2. Courts have almost universally held that **owner associations do not constitute state action** and are not subject to constitutional restrictions- can restrict hanging of political signs, for example.

## Zoning

### Constitutional challenges:

1. Zoning: states delegate their police power to zone to local municipalities who adopt zoning ordinances
   1. Types: (1) **Use Zoning** regulates kind of uses that are allowed within each subsection, generally a pyramid structure allowing less intensive uses in the more intensive areas; (2) **Area Zoning** regulates size of lots, height of building and other aspects of the physical composition of a property
   2. Motivations for zoning often justified as (1) prospectively limiting the harms that might arise from the proximity of incompatible land uses; (2) also used as a tool to influence the composition of their communities and the tax & budgeting implications that come w/ that. (3) Modern zoning ordinances are also used as: (a) development incentives; (b) aesthetics; (c) historic preservation of land; (d) combatting big box development
      1. Modern approaches focus more on sustainability & equity and challenge traditional zoning for its environmental and social costs. They favor development of **mixed used communities**
2. **Substantive Due Process**-**economic rights**: rational basis review—**means** must have a rational relation to the legitimate **ends** (health, safety or public welfare). Unlikely to win, very deferential to legislature.
   1. **Euclid**: ordinance cause property value to drop by 75% of its value—court deferred the legislature, ordinance could fairly be described as solving a public nuisance (analogy). (Brandies approach)
      1. **Penn Coal v. Mahon** (taking clause): company wanted to mine coal in a way that would violate the state statute meant to protect the integrity of nearby lands (retained rights of support)
         * **Approach 1 (Holmes):** balancing test—the diminution of property value to the owner v. the public interest.Narrowed scope of public interest to single house at issue, narrowed diminution in value to the specific “right of support” the coal company retained (they lost 100% of that right-high loss of value, didn’t look at the entire estate)
         * **Approach 2 (Brandies):** is there a nuisance? If so, likely can be regulated. Even if balancing approach: Look at broad context—public crisis of overmining. Viewed “support rights” in context of entire estate-would still have a lot of coal to mine
      2. Back to Euclid: best argument for P is that high diminution in value to property and try to limit the public’s interest to these specific 68 acres and not entire city. Best argument for P- is it a nuisance? Yes: factories- pollution, smells; apartments- traffic, noises, overcrowding, height
   2. In Euclid, ordinance valid even though partially over and under inclusive- hard to know when harm starts and ends. But P can succeed if shows that ordinance entirely arbitrary & useless to a specific property
      1. **Nectow:** court ruled ordinance as applied to a specific parcel of land was arbitrary and unreasonable (**means** issue). Public interest was very low & the diminution in value was high- the piece of property was entirely unusable. The low public interest didn’t allow for that much harm.
         * Very rarely applicable-generally courts will defer and not weigh interests
         * Had strong expert testimony from master of the project that was useless for public.
   3. In Buchanan the court struck down a zoning ordinance that prohibited blacks and whites from moving onto a street w/ the majority of residents being the opposite race—**ends** were not legitimate
3. **Substantive Due Process**-fundamental rights: **strict scrutiny**—if by looking into the history and tradition of our country find a fundamental right, the means must be necessary (narrowly tailored and least restrictive possible) to achieve a compelling government interest
   1. **Moore:** limited occupancy to **nuclear family**- grandmother couldn’t live w/ grandson
      1. **Fundamental right** found: looked not at just tradition of white suburbia, but at how minorities had historically lived, relying on these family structures (concurrence even felt that ordinance had racial discriminatory intent)
      2. Dissent: wanted to still **defer to legislature**; shaped issue as “sharing a kitchen or suit” making it sound insignificant
4. **Equal Protection**- suspect class/fundamental right: will trigger strict scrutiny
   1. **Belle Terre:** limited amount of non-related people that could live. Related v. Unrelated.
      1. Court found no fundamental right or suspect class—found a rational relation between the means and the police power ends. Wanted a family style neighborhood; policy wasn’t arbitrary or unreasonably apply to some and not to others
      2. Dissent: found fundamental right of association and privacy and classifying based on relation will burden that right—strict scrutiny, legislation should be invalid
         * A minority of state courts have interpreted their state constitutions to provide for broader protections for nontraditional families right to live together
5. **Baseline constitutional framework**: ordinances are presumptively valid, and court will be hesitant to look deeply into motives of legislature. Only when there is a suspect class/ fundamental right that presumption is discarded, and court will apply strict scrutiny. In all analysis’s - can challenge the means and/or the ends

### Prior non-conforming use

1. **Belleville v. Parrillo’s:** a restaurant that was grandfathered into the residential ordinance tried to become a disco
   1. **Prior non-conforming use**- when an ordinance changes one is allowed to continue with non-conforming uses started before the change, as long as not a serious nuisance or harm on public
      1. Trying to balance the rights and reliance of existing owners with the expectations and needs of the community
   2. Court held that a disco was not the same use as that of a restaurant
      1. **Rule:** an existing non-confirming use will be permitted only if it is **substantially similar** to the use that it was used for at the time the ordinance was passed
         * While must be similar in **kind**, **debate in courts** if allowed to increase the **intensity** of the use, or if allowed to **expand** to use more of a given parcel
         * Note— disfavored: If doubt as to if the use is similar enough, it will be disapproved
      2. Don’t want legislatively created monopoly- meant to protect ownership right/ fair use of property, not meant to give the person themselves a monopoly to do business in a residential area
   3. **Amortization:** other states strike a balance by limiting the time one can continue a non-confirming use, granting a phase out period. Time limit gives owner time to recoup investment and plan ahead.
   4. Abandonment or destruction**:** If abandoned the non-conforming use status is lost; moreover, if building is destroyed by fire- most courts will not allow the owner to rebuild
   5. Generally, the use can be transferred to another owner, though some courts will not allow it

### Vested Rights

1. **Stone v. City of Wilton:** landowners purchased property to build low-income, federally subsidized housing. Prior to commencement, city rezoned land into single-family housing.
   1. **Rule:** owners have vested rights to existing zoning law if they have invested substantially in good faith reliance on that law (meaning, the new ordinance will not interfere with their plans for the property)
      1. Majority of courts will require the substantial investment be made based on a validly issued building **permit** or other approval; others only require that owner incurred substantial costs in reasonable reliance on existing law, even in the **absence** of a permit
   2. **How substantial must an investment be?** **How does on measure it?**
      1. One approach is to compare the ratio of the expenses to the total cost of the project (and only consider those expenses relating exclusively to the proposed development)
      2. Others add additional factors like: good faith of landowner, notice of proposals for new ordinance, type of expenditures- could they be used for other uses, the kind of project, the location and ultimate cost. **They require more than mere preparation**- like leveling land (consider amount completed), & beyond preliminary negotiations with contractors/architects
      3. **Minority grant vested rights upon filling a valid and fully complete build permit application**, without any need to show anything else
      4. Some grant if developer obtained a site-specific approval (i.e. a preliminary subdivision plan) for development even before a building permit is issued; some even allow if apply for site-specific approval
   3. In Walton: did not enter into any contracts, made no bids, brought no materials too site—not rights
      1. Note: P tried challenging the ends- rezoning had discriminatory purpose; court rejected that- city was balancing competing interests

### Rezoning of specific land

1. **Rezoning:** developers who want to build projects inconsistent with current zoning laws will attempt to get the planning board or city council to rezone the relevant parcel or district.
   1. **Consistency:** Many states zoning enabling acts require any changes to accord w/ the comprehensive plan. Some courts will hold legislatures strictly to a general plan, while others will grant greater discretion, and some may not require consistency at all (particularly in states that don’t have planning requirements)
   2. Courts will also take less deferential approach to particularized zoning changes using these doctrines:
2. **Contract Zoning:** sometimes cities my rezone areas based on certain conditions the owner must follow to ensure that the rezoning doesn’t have a negative effect on the community. Might include special limitations on uses, specially tailored physical restrictions or require dedication of some of the land to maintain open space
   1. Some states strike down contract zoning as (1) not authorized by zoning enabling act; (2) not w/n general plan; (3) illegal preferential spot zoning; (4) unconstitutional type of law making that leads to corruption
   2. Other courts are increasingly approving of the practice, while some state statutes expressly allowing it
   3. Some courts distinguish between bilateral and unilateral agreements, disallowing bilateral contract, but allowing unilateral ones (“conditions”). Others disallow conditions also, but allow a party to voluntarily accept certain restrictions as part of the rezoning process
   4. **Durand v. IDC Bellingham:** company suggested that would be willing to donate 8m to town to enable them to build a high school if a rezoning to allow their factory to be built was approved
      1. **Holding:** not K zoning- there was no promise made contingent upon the money, company offered the money but no promise to vote in favor was made in return for the gift. Otherwise the rezoning was not arbitrary or unreasonable and therefore upheld
         * Zoning regs. enacted by town meeting w/ police power h/v strong presumption of validity
      2. **Dissent:** clearly the money heavily influenced decision, might have even been a K
3. **Spot Zoning:** selective rezoning that benefits or burdens a single parcel or small group of parcels. Some courts hold it is invalid unless there is a “**clear showing**” of a reasonable basis for selective rezoning based on the comprehensive plan and the benefits of the change. But by and large difficult to win challenges to spot zoning.
4. **Change or mistake requirement:** in some jurisdictions rezoning of individual parcels can only be made to reflect changes in the character of a neighborhood since the original zoning code was enacted or mistakes in that zoning. Can raise questions of what constitutes sufficient change or mistake, often some latitude granted.
5. **Rezoning as quasi-judicial:** some temper deference to local legislative bodies by characterizing statutes that rezone an individual parcel as quasi-judicial or administrative rather than legislative. In the minority of courts that take this approach, the process will look more like an administrative one (w/ procedural rights), than legislative.

### Exclusionary Zoning

* Concern that zoning causes economic stratification and will often exclude certain races and ethnicities
* Some claim large split between white/black neighborhoods is just an efficient market based on personal choice and income distribution. Others claim that beyond that, it is heavily affected by government action
* Signs of exclusionary zoning: Single family homes only, large lot sizes, and large square footage of houses

#### Fair housing Act

1. 3 step claim—24 C.F.R 100.500
   1. First P must make **prima facia case** showing that the challenged practice has a discriminatory effect—**disparate impact**, don’t need intent (Inc.—race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status or national origin)
      1. **Texas H.U.D v. Inclusive Communities:** officially affirmed that disparate impact is enough; more importantly established that there is a **robust causal requirement**: a claim that rests on statistics must fail if it cannot point to a specific policy that is creating the disparity
      2. Generally, will meet initial burden by showing (1) statistical evidence that a policy or practice has a greater impact on a class of person protected by the act than others; (2) the policy tends to perpetuate segregation. It is a fact specific inquiry
      3. **Mhany v. Nassau:** applied burden shifting approach- bound by federal agency rules because the circuit never found the relevant statute ambiguous. Ruled that P’s made out a prima facia case
   2. Then the burden switches to the state to show that the policy is **necessary** in achieving a **substantial, legitimate and nondiscriminatory goal**—can’t just be hypothetical or speculative
   3. Then shifts back to P to show could the same goal **could be achieved in a less discriminatory** way

#### State Constitutional Challenges- The Mount Laurel Doctrine (NJ)

1. **Facts**: Priced out of expensive suburb—big lots, big house requirement, single family homes and large area set aside for just industrial use—but barely of it is actually being utilized. (some multi-family building, but meant for elder people and those with higher income—mostly one bedroom)
   1. Excluded: Minorities, those with families, younger couples
2. City claimed the reason was for tax reasons- less children meant less taxes and big lots meant strong tax base
3. **Holding**: developing municipalities must use their zoning powers in an **affirmative manner** to allow for the development of affordable housing for those w/ low/medium income—need various choices of housing available.
   1. Mount Laurel II: extended to **all cities in the state, not just developing ones**
      1. Also, unlike in first case, the court did not leave it up to the cities to fix the situation—as they had shown that they wouldn’t—and ordered an **affirmative remedy** to encourage construction of low income housing (i.e. provided three regional judges to determine each region’s fair share of housing, could order government subsidies and could appoint a special advisor)
      2. In NJ, the legislature transferring authority over Mount Laurel cases to an administrative agency, but the courts have allowed P’s to seek judicial redress
   2. Most states have **not** gone as far as Mount Laurel, believe that it is **social engineering**
      1. But more states have addressed the issue through their own statutes, some like NJ’s.
      2. Many municipalities require new developments to set aside a certain % of housing units be set aside for low income persons.
         * Debate as to its efficiency- some arguing it makes building costlier, leading to less building & less housing, only furthering the issue. While others argue it has helped to restore the issue that exclusionary zoning created
      3. Other “growth control” ordinances that seek to make hard caps on development in order to ensure that the city resources are not stretched too thin have been controversial and gone both ways
4. **Reasoning:** interpreted the state constitution to require cities to not exclude low income residents from residing there—essential for general welfare
   1. General welfare applies beyond the borders of each town, but to all citizens of the state—as the city is utilizing the police power granted by the state

# Unit 4: the power to transfer

* The power to transfer determines who gets what on what terms

## The Estates System: An Introduction, Complexities and Charts

1. Bronson 1840: there is no natural law granting a man right in property after he dies, and his children have no natural right in inheritance; point—we don’t have to have the system we have, but the one we have follows:
2. **Vocabulary**:
   1. **Present estate**/present interest/possessory estate: who has the current interest in the land
      1. If not preceded by any other interest and is not subject to any condition precedent
   2. **Future interest**—someone who has a future interest in the land
   3. **Fee simple absolute**—an estate of indefinite duration
      1. Most complete form of interest in property the law will recognize
      2. It is descendible, alienable and divisible, but cannot be destroyed
      3. Language of conveyance: “To A” or “To A and her heirs”
      4. By definition it is not subject to future interests
   4. **Defeasible fees:**
      1. **Fee Simple Determinable**: when grantor holds the future interest that can return to him based on a condition of words of duration; the future interest of the grantor is a “possibility of reverter:”
         * Look for words like “as long,” “until,” “while,” “during” and so forth (also “revert back”)
         * If the thing occurs that was conditioned, it will **automatically return** back to the grantor or grantor’s heirs; immediately return to possession of grantor
      2. **Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent**: grantor holds a future interest that is cut short by words of condition, it is a defeasible fee followed by a “right of entry.”
         * “Provided that,” “but if,” “however if,” “on condition that.”
         * This also cuts shorts a preceding estate, but it doesn’t automatically divest the possessor of the property, **rather the grantor must bring a claim of ejectment**—becomes presently exercisable (but no property rights change until the grantor acts).
      3. **Fee Simple Subject to Executory limitation**: if a future interest is cut short or divests a prior estate is created in the grantee, making the preceding fee simple subject to executory limitation
         * **Springing**: an executory interest that divests an estate held by the grantor
         * **Shifting**: one that divests an interest held by a grantee
         * These are necessarily limited by a condition precedent and therefore will never be vested
   5. **Life estate**—an estate that confers a right to possession for the life of the owner
      1. By definition it must be subject to future interests
      2. A life tenant cannot sell a fee simple absolute, **can only convey the interest has at the time**.
         * Can sell a life estate—but dependent on the life of the conveyor of the life estate (if A has life estate and gives to B, interest extinguished when A dies)
      3. Language of conveyance: “to A for life”
      4. A future interest following a life estate in a grantor is called a **reversion**—will revert back to the grantor by a *natural* termination of the preceding estate
      5. A future interest after a life estate created in a third party is called a **remainder**—it too will cannot cut short or divest any possessory right, third party will only acquire possession with natural termination of previous estate
         * **Contingent** remainder: if created in an unborn or unidentified person or is it conditioned on the occurrence of some future event, other than natural termination
           + Still cannot cut short previous estate, “To A for life, and then to B’s (unborn) children”—will only transfer when A dies on condition that B had children
         * **Vested** interests are when we have identified persons and there are no condition precedents.
         * **Vested subject to open:** when have a class grant, if B has children, we have identified persons, but more people can be added, diluting the property interest
         * **Vested subject to Divestment:** it is vested in person but can be prevented from becoming possessory by an executory interest
   6. General note: “heirs” are not determined until one dies

1.Break the fact pattern down into chronological steps or points in time

2. For each point in time:

A. If the point in time is making of a conveyance: parse the interests created, identify the nature & quantum of each & determine if any residual nature in grantor- and if so, its nature & quantum

B. If point in time is any other event, construe the effect of the even on the interests of the parties

C. Based on A&B describe the interests of every party at each point in time- state of title

3. Arrange state of title for each point in time sequentially to compose chain of title

## Estates Doctrines (& Covenants) and Limitations

* The rules that follow are meant to act as a way as condensing who has control over land to one individual—**enabling freedom of action** (i.e. Presumption against forfeiture—grant fee simple absolute allowing for current owner to exert total control; Doctrine against waste—life tenant can only do so much w/ land & if violates terms will revert back to fee simple owner to use the land as sees fit; doctrines against alienation, new estates and racial covenants meant to cabin the power previous owners have over current possessors)
* Random note: estates are only created through transfer of property and if one violates the terms/conditions the only possible remedy is divestment; covenants aren’t inherently created through a transfer of property (even real, only through transfer for notice purposes) & the remedies are for damages or injunctions—but not always obvious from language which one dealing with

1. Presumption against forfeiture**:** Presumption against terminating possessory interests of the current possessor—reluctance to recognize future interests, **will favor present possessory owners**. Majority rule.
   1. Will look for clear or explicit creation of future interests—if choice is between future interest and mere precatory language (statement of purpose not meant to be binding) **presumption of fee simple absolute**
      1. **Similarly**: if choice between covenant or future interest—covenant; between fee simple determinable or fee simple subject to condition subsequent—subject to condition precedent (because ownership won’t automatically be forfeited); life estate and any type of fee simple—fee simple
   2. Logic: future interests reduce the alienability of property and restrict the autonomy of the possessor to do w/ property as they see fit (could also argue generally furthers grantors intent- presumably intended to give up full rights)
      1. Also, incentivize the grantor to be clear when transferring the property, protects the grantee
   3. Some courts don’t require as clear language for charitable contributions, eager to find future interest- donors want to ensure used for charity & in public interest to by maintaining the charitable use
      1. These minority of courts will grant substantial legal effect to language of purpose—whether recognizing a future interest, a covenant or constructive trust
      2. Most though maintain presumption against forfeiture- just interpret that language as precatory
   4. **Edwards v. Bradley—**does not apply the presumption of forfeiture (minority rule- Va.)
      1. Focused on **effectuating the intent of the grantor**, considering the language and the surrounding circumstances—don’t need to be explicit as long as language can be reasonably construed to effectuate such intent
         * Intentionally didn’t use the words “fee simple” in the relevant provision (used elsewhere)
         * Daughters financial circumstances and restraints mentioned in the will indicate life estate
         * Don’t need to use the words life estate, especially when prepared by experienced attorney
   5. Note: The changed conditions doctrine denying enforcement of covenants when circumstances have drastically changed that they no longer serve a benefit has traditionally not applied to future interest
2. Doctrine against waste**:** In order to balance the interest of current possessor and those w/ future interest, present possessor cannot unreasonably damage the estate
   1. **McIntyre v. Scarbrough:** sold piece of land to buyers but retained some of the land as a life estate (she needed income, but place to live).
      1. P tried to extinguish the life estate as the old lady stopped paying her property taxes and let the property decay and become is disrepair—permissive waste
      2. **Majority**: there was a warranty of the conveyance that required her to upkeep the property; **occupancy was present** because doesn’t require permanent physical presence, but to hold or keep for use, to possess—she never removed her possessions from the property. **Key failure** was not paying taxes
   2. Two types of waste:
      1. **Voluntary waste**: active actions that damage the property.
         * “**Open Mines**”: removing natural resources like timber, minerals or oil and gas—generally cannot remove these unless resource was already being mined when life tenant came to possession
         * But no obligation to pay for repairs caused by natural disaster, and not required to be compensated for it by subsequent owner if they do (sticky situation)
      2. **Permissive waste**: waste by omission—failure to make ordinary repairs, failure to pay taxes
   3. **Remedies**: can sue for damages or injunction stopping the waste, often allowed to sue even the estate after the tenant’s death.
      1. By statutes, many states allow for the termination of the life estate—some require that the waste be voluntary in order to terminate
      2. When the damage is intentional, some allow recovery of double or triple damages
   4. **Ameliorating waste:** if life tenant changes the character of the property but increases the value or utility of the property—traditionally any fundamental change was waste, but today it is sometimes condoned
      1. Most courts will approve substantial alterations that increase value if justified in light of changed circumstances, consistent with what a fee simple owner would do & in line w/ intent of parties
      2. **3rd restatement**: duty of a life tenant is not to decrease the market value of the interest-alteration is only prohibited if the future interest holders would have a reasonable ground of objection
      3. **Pabst Brewing**: ordinally cannot make any changes, even beneficial, to the identity of the property, but can make fundamental changes when a “complete and permanent change of surrounding conditions has deprived the property of its value and usefulness as previously used”
      4. If not longer useful as is and doesn’t want to develop it, the life tenant can try to sell it by getting permission from future owner to sell and split profits (can try and sell as life estate, but not very marketable). Some courts allow for a forced sale when it is in the “best interest of all parties.”
   5. **Other notes:**
      1. Can avoid the default rules limiting life estates by contracting around them
      2. Can create flexibility by designating property as a **trust** for life, instead a life estate—if make your spouse a trustee for life, at which point will go to children, the trustee can sell the property if acting in the best interests of the beneficiaries
      3. Generally nothing prohibiting one from destroying or altering their own fee simple property, but some courts have prohibited execution wills that ordered destruction of valuable homes after the death of the testator, particularly when it would impact the value of surrounding properties
3. Rule Against Creation of New Estates**:** a conveyance that does not fit within any of the established categories must be interpreted to fit an established estate
   1. Formal and substantive: formal—must put their conveyances in a recognizable form; substantive—certain packages of right will not be recognized
   2. **Johnson v. Whiton**: grandfather tried to convey a fee that can only go in the future to any heirs on his daughter’s father’s side
      1. **Holding:** a man cannot create a new type of inheritance—inheritance must be allowed by both sides of the family, we have no other system recognizing otherwise. Therefore, just a fee simple.
      2. Note: words of purchase refer to who the grantee is, words of limit refer to the interest at stake
   3. **Note:** in practice, we have seen new types of property be created over the years, even though not formally recognized as such within estates:
      1. Public trust doctrine—create a type of public ownership that defines who can access and sell it
      2. Common interest developments—individual fee simple property owners joining together to create this broader property interest to benefit them all, an interest the legislatures have recognized
   4. **Hypo**: property owner that has conveyed a lot in fee simple on condition that she will turn it into a common interest development—is this a new estate? Should it be allowed?
      1. Anti-allowing: doctrine against the creation of new estates- want to promote alienability (w/o this rule- will raise uncertainty and information costs) and the ability to use property as see fit
      2. Should we be able to rebut a presumption? If the new estate was a bunch of citizens coming together and recognized by legislature, then maybe courts should be able to say that this is legitimate type of estate—like common interest developments
      3. Note: lack of clarity when something is a “new estate” and when simply a defeasible fee
4. Rule against unreasonable restraints on alienation **(in Common Interest Developments)**
   1. **Serio:** Developer sold property and the deed required owners to get his consent to sell the land within the next 5 years
      1. **Majority**: it is invalid because interfering with the alienability of the fee simple estate, concerned that will give the developer unqualified control, need to limit the control to some extent and make sure property owners can do with their property as they see fit
         * Case of Clark: there was in control for ten years and multiple people needed to give consent, here shorter years and one person—but still problematic
      2. Dissent: restraint on alienation should be allowed to ensure that the developer can get a return on investment-economic analysis. Also protects the purchasers, gives them some security in their own outlay—protect early purchasers. Lastly, public benefit that is encourages development which is beneficial for society.
         * Seems to really be in part about excluding people on race or ethnicity
      3. **Consent to Sell Clauses:** as Serio indicated, covenants requiring consent for a developer are often struck down as unreasonable restraints on alienation, certainly if the developer no longer owns any development in the land it would surely be struck down (even under 3rd restatement that allows covenants in gross). (Dissents logic in Serio only applies in cases like it, where developer still involved)
         * In contrast, covenants that grant such powers to homeowner’s and condominium associations are ordinarily upheld if **either** (1) they require the association to act reasonably; (2) they act as preemptive rights that ensure that the owner can transfer the unit for its fair market value to the association or its members
   2. **Woodside**: Deceleration amended to limit renting out your condo to anyone for more than 9/12 months of any given year & couldn’t lease in first 12 months of ownership & need approval of board of directors
      1. Court upheld the amendment—"Condominium owners comprise a little **democratic sub society** of necessity more restrictive as it pertains to use of condominium property than may be existent outside the condominium organization.”
         * Inherent in concept of condos is to promote health, happiness and peace of mind of the majority of unit owners
      2. Declaration & amendments have strong presumption of validity. If wholly arbitrary or violates public policy will be invalidated.
         * **Majority of courts:** Duly adopted amendments restricting occupancy or leasing is binding upon unit owners who purchased their units prior, **can be retroactively applied**
           1. Florida Leg. effectively overturned Woodside, prohibiting retroactive lease restrictions on non-consenting owners
         * **Debate:** if they are also valid if passed through bylaws instead of through amendments
         * **3rd Restatement:** requires unanimous consent for amendments that “prohibit or materially restrict the use or occupancy of units” or that “deprive owners of significant property or civil rights.” However, it is disclaimable if the declaration provides otherwise (as long as statute doesn’t prohibit retroactive enforcement)
           1. Note: in Woodside declaration stated that amendments could be made by 2/3 of the tenants and would be binding on all units—notice
      3. Less concern of unqualified control than previous case, rather democratic sub society sanctioned by the legislature; Court recognizing that ways of owning land is changing
         * On other hand: these two cases are very distinguishable—rules passed here by “democratic society,” not a single developer
   3. **Notes:**
      1. **Total restraints** on alienation of fees simple interests are uniformly held void and unenforceable
         * Owners should presumptively have full control over the property they own, and a central power is to transfer on their terms; would contravene the very notion of ownership if have absolute restrain on alienation of the property
         * Otherwise courts will generally allow for some amount of restraint if reasonable: “weigh the utility of the restraint against the injurious consequences of enforcing the restraint”
         * Indirect restraints on alienation caused by contracts or convents (making the land hard to market) will be invalidated only if lack any rational justification
      2. Restrains on alienation are generally allowed if the holder of the property is a charity
      3. CDC’s establish housing for low income families and prohibit leasing of the property or sale to a family that is not a low-income family—restraint on alienation has been upheld as reasonable
      4. Proff: perhaps if restrains “use and occupancy” & not ownership, lesser degree of restraint on alienation

### the rule against racial restrictions

* 1. **Shelley v. Kraemer:** restrictive covenant prohibiting blacks from purchasing property, neighbors brought suit after a property was sold to a black person
     1. **Holding:** upholding the racially restrictive covenant would constitute state action and violate the 14th Amendment—why?
        + **(Version #1:** State action because covenants resemble state zoning power)
        + **Version #2:** case of willing buyers and sellers; **but for** the intervention of the courts the sale would go through and there would be no segregation
        + **Version #3:** cumulative decisions—the court and state where very involved in validating the covenant (court specifically validated multiple decisions up to this point)
        + **Version #4:** courts simply cannot validate private discrimination—under this reading, there is no end in sight
     2. Notes:
        + Would be easy case today—invalid under fair housing act and civil rights act of 1866 (held to apply to private parties since Shelley)
        + If state action was found, court seemed to be looking for disparate impact, today under Washington v. Davis—need disparate treaent to make a 14th amendment claim
  2. **Evans v. Abney:** will states that park should be used only for whites, after was ruled unconstitutional b/c like public institution, question whether property should revert back to heirs because will unfulfilled fee simple determinable
     1. Didn’t apply the ***cy pres doctrine****-* purpose of will was clear that to be used only for this purpose, court should not reinterpret the will to carry out the general charitable intent of the will
        + While generally the doctrine allows for courts to modify conveyances that are incapable of their charitable intent for some reason to effectuate it as nearly as possible to intention- not applicable here, because clear that intent was otherwise and essential to his plan
     2. No state action in allowing park to revert to heirs—the park is being terminated, a loss felt equally by all people; no state actor or judges acted with any discriminatory intent in resolving at the final decision
        + Arguably no action at all—simply allowing a fee simple determinable to automatically revert back to heirs, facially neutral law being allowed to run its course
        + (Note: while irrelevant today, court seemed to be looking for discriminatory treatment)
     3. Dissent: under any of the holding of Shelley, could have found state action here
        + Willing parties—attorney general representing the people wanted to desegregate park
        + Host of previous court & state decisions lead to the current state of affairs
        + Validates that segregation okay in the private sphere
     4. Conclusion: very uncertain where we stand currently
  3. Notes:
     1. Scholars point to the **artificial nature** of “State Action” doctrine—state is always involved, especially in property rights where giving the right to one takes it away from another. Also, since a state could always stop discrimination, by not acting, they are being discriminatory in some way
     2. **Rice case**: lower courts held that Shelley did not apply because the plaintiff had herself contractually agreed to the restriction—supreme court evenly decided on matter, so affirmed
     3. **3rd restatement**: covenant is “unenforceable if it unreasonably burdens a fundamental constitutional right”—comment makes clear that this applies only to those restrictions whose enforcement by a state court **would constitute state action**, but does not apply constitutional standards where state action would otherwise not be present
        + Why have it then? By ruling it invalid by public policy before it gets to courts, might help eliminate these altogether
        + Recall: outside of racial context, state action has rarely been found in covenants (rare cases ruling otherwise either based on federal or state constitution)
     4. In applying Cy Pres doctrine to charitable trusts: hypothetical question is whether the donor knowing of the changed circumstances would prefer to have the charitable donation fail altogether or modified to serve a related purpose
        + **Traditionally**: Burden on party seeking modification to prove that donor had a general charitable intent. Also, the purpose of the trust needed to be actually or practically impossible to achieve.
        + **Modern trend** (presume general charitable intent): **3rd restatement**: if the purposes of a charitable trust become impossible, impractical or wasteful to achieve, the trust shall be redirected to a purpose that reasonably approximates the stated purpose, unless the terms of the trust provide otherwise. Uniform trust code adds that even if specific provisions say should revert to grantor on failure of trust shall not be enforced unless the grantor is still living or if in existence less than 21 years
        + Debate if new test scarifies donor’s intent for good of public or if approximates what the general intent of most people are
        + Courts often reform trusts that illegally restricted their benefits on the basis of sex or race arguing that the grantors would have had this intent if they lived in this time period

## Concurrent ownership: sharing ownership at the same time through tenancy in common & joint

1. **Concurrent tenancy**: two or more people owning the property; defining features are (1) right to use the **whole property** (no matter the fractional interest); (2) right to **share profits**; (3) and **bear the costs** of the property (but can contract around these rules)
   1. **Cooperation**—allows parties to jointly finance purchases & pool together the resources to maximize usage of the property (think INS v. AP)
   2. In all forms, have the right to exit—why? Alienability and personal choice to sell your property; also threat of exit could promote cooperation
   3. Courts will always need to balance the goals of cooperation between the parties and each individual’s personal right to the property
2. **Tenancy in common:** each tenant in common has a separate, but undivided interest
   1. **Separate**: each is independently descendible, conveyable, and devisable
   2. **Undivided**: each tenant in common has right to possess the whole of the property (cannot charge rent from each other, unless there is ouster)
   3. Can also be divided unequally, so one person can have 70% and another 30%
      1. Both have right to occupy whole property, but will have different share of profits and costs
   4. **Partition:** can bring action to terminate the co-tenancy and divide the property or its proceeds
   5. **Ouster:** when co-tenant refuses to allow other co-tenant possession of the property (co-tenant must attempt to possess and be foiled)—other party then entitled to rent
      1. And if nature of ouster in that occupying party makes claim of absolute ownership, will start the clock for adverse possession claim
   6. Common example: timeshares
3. **Joint Tenancy:** same as tenant in common but with survivorship treatment.
   1. **Survivorship**: upon death, the other tenant acquires whole interest (dead tenant's interest is gone). Known as the poor mans will.
   2. Traditionally required the **4 unities at time of creation**, and unities must **constantly exist**:
      1. **Time** – interest must be acquired and vest at **same time**
      2. **Title** – each must **acquire title by same instrument** or by joint AP- can’t get via intestacy
      3. **Interest** – each must have **same legal interest**, e.g. fee simple, life estate, lease (& **fractional** amount)
      4. **Possession** – each must have the **right to possess the whole**
   3. **Modern approach:** look to the intent of parties
   4. **Severance:** joint tenant that transfers her property will destroy the right of survivorship of her fellow owners with respect to her share, it **converts to tenancy in common** (breaking 4 unities= severance)
      1. “Self-Severance:” can sever just by conveying the interest to yourself as tenant in common
      2. If you murder of joint tenant severs the joint tenancy 🡪 can’t profit from killing
      3. If get divorced, generally will sever the joint tenancy and convert to tenancy in common
      4. Some states require that a conveyance be publicly recorded to sever a joint tenancy to preclude the possibility of fraud (benefiting if other dies first, and denying the other if you die first)
      5. Severance only occurs between the selling owner and remaining owners—if there were 3 parties and one sold his portion, other two still have joint tenancy with each other
   5. Can also file for **partition** of the property
   6. Generally, can encumber your interest, but won’t survive the death of the encumbering tenant
      1. See Tehnent v. Boswell for rule when lease out property
   7. **Bank Accounts:** joint bank accounts assumed to be joint tenancy and 4 unities are rarely required; question when elderly people create joint accounts with children—was it simply for convenience or did she intend for right of survivorship?
   8. Note: default is generally tenancy in common—most basic form of cooperative ownership and allows people to control how property transferred.
      1. But can causes friction if no will—multiple heirs will own fractions of property, making reasonable and efficient decisions impossible
      2. Joint Tenancy solves this issue, but one major concern is that joint tenancy can be fractured accidently, especially in jurisdictions that sever w/ leases
4. **Ark Land v. Harper**: Debate whether the property should be partitioned in kind or by sale
   1. **Presumption against partition in sale:** Partition in kind is the preferred method of partition because it leaves cotenants holding the same estate as before and does not force a sale on unwilling cotenants
      1. Strong preference of partition in sale in all state statutes
      2. In cases of sale, some permit forced sale of on tenant to the other
   2. To overcome the presumption a party seeking a partition by through sale must show (1) that the property cannot be conveniently partitioned in kind; (2) the interests of one or more of the parties will be promoted by the sale; (3) & that the interests of the other parties will not be prejudiced by the sale
   3. **Holding:** trial court erred because it only focused on the economic value of the property, rather courts also must consider that **sentimental or emotional interests** in the property due to longstanding ownership in determinizing if the opposing party would be prejudiced by the sale
      1. In fact, the sentimental value should ordinarily control when it is shown that the property can be partitioned in kind, thought it may entail some economic inconvenience to the party seeking a sale
      2. Think Holmes decision and consider **Radin**—property becomes one w/ a person
   4. Court said that Ark land took risk in buying out most of the family members and assuming would convince the last few—their economic injury here does not rise to the injurious inconvenience that would justify stripping the family of their emotional interest in preserving their family home
      1. Can’t allow commercial entities to buy out most of properties and “evict” the remaining tenants because the commercial value of the property will be harmed—any time a commercial entity buys land w/ commercial purpose, expectation will increase value, allowing them to always evict
      2. Though—consider that this will cause **holdouts** to occur, even though they don’t really care
   5. Dissent: agree in theory, but not applicable here—no high sentimental value, most were willing to sell property and the ones that kept it often are not there
   6. **Most courts: partition in sale if division of the parcel is not practical or partition by kind will create great prejudice, substantial injury or be inequitable to the tenants**
      1. While some reject partition in sale if there are significant identity interests in the property (Ark Land), **most courts** simply order partition by sale if the property is worth “materially less” divided than it would be sold as a single parcel
   7. Note on partition: grantors sometimes attempt to prevent partition by including restrictions against it in the deed or will—traditionally held void as restraints on alienation, today upheld is reasonably limited in time and have a reasonable purpose
5. **Spiller v. Mackereth:** one tenant took total occupancy of warehouse on common property
   1. Both offered to buy interest from other, both declined. One took over the entire property as a warehouse and the other party said vacate part of the building or pay rent and he didn’t do so. Question whether the occupying tenant owed rent
   2. **Non-liability for exclusive possession** unless the other party tried to occupy the property as well and was prevented from doing so— ask: was the other party ousted? Denied right of entry.
   3. **Holding:** no ouster here, the letter said nothing about the other party wanting to occupy the property, just that the occupier needed to vacate or pay rent- didn’t demand equal use and enjoyment of the property
      1. Other tenant never asked or tried to gain access or use of property, not action taken to deny him
   4. Policy: doesn’t seem to promote cooperation, sort of a race to try & use up property and try to take advantage of other
   5. Other courts apply **reasonableness** test: requires that each tenant cannot unreasonably interfere with other tenants and if they didn’t agree as to use then other tenant is to be compensated for others greater use
6. **Tehnet v. Boswell:** Do leases sever a joint tenancy? If so, then lease on property isn’t terminated with death of the tenant (if not, then property would revert to surviving the join-tenant and lease would generally be cancelled)
   1. **Holding:** **Presumption against severance**: We require there be a clear intent to create joint tenancy, so need clear intent to ruin it also—leases will not sever
      1. Don’t want people to accidently sever property
   2. **Other courts:** leases sever joint tenancy (because changed interest in land to present interest, to revisionary, ruining unities of interest)
      1. Pro: increases alienability of property, allows those to enter into leases that will survive the death of the owner, people will be hesitant to lease property that they can lose at any time
      2. On other hand, right of survivorship might promote alienability by putting the property ownership from two parties, to one—easier for property to be bought and sold

## Concurrent ownership: marital property

1. **Tenancy by the Entirety**: Same as joint tenancy but **requires marriage** (only available in minority of states)
   1. More stable than join tenancy because absent agreement the tenancy by the entirety is only severed on divorce or death
   2. Most states: neither party encumber their interest in the property without each other’s consent and creditors cannot attach property held through it to satisfy debts of one of the spouses
      1. **Sawada v. Endo:** 3 approaches:
         * Majority (**Endo**): creditors cannot reach property held in the form of tenancy by the entirety to satisfy the debts of one spouse; even if the property is sold or the debtor spouse survives the non-debtor, the creditor has no claim on the estate
         * Smaller group holds that creditors cat attach the life interest of a tenant by the entirety, but cannot reach the non-debtor spouse’s survivorship interest and may not be able to demand partition of the property
         * A few states old that the creditor may only attach the debtor’s spouse’s right of survivorship; the creditor only may possess the property if the debtor survives the non-debtor spouse
      2. Policy rational for limiting the reach of creditors to marital property: often dealing w/ family home and don’t want one spouse’s decisions to upend the family; moreover-generally creditors will have notice of this, so the “impenetrable shield” is not so concerning (though it is true that in this case, where liability was due to a car accident, that does not apply)
   3. Applicable in states that don’t have community property, can be entered into by married couples
2. History:
   1. **Coverture**—doctrine at common law was that a wife’s identity dissolved into the identity of the husband, he had full control over all property owned by parties (could lease, convey, mortgage)
      1. **Married Women’s Property Acts**: abolished coverture, granted women the same rights married and unmarried
      2. Still didn’t bring full equality though, because women worked at home and therefore did not get rights to marital property and gender inequality in access to property remained (was likely aimed more at solidifying the family, than ensuring women got their fair share)
   2. **Dower**: at common law surviving wife had a life estate in 1/3rd of the freehold lands of which the husband acquired at any time during their marriage and would be inherited by their children
   3. **Curtsey**: husband has life estate in all the lands in which his wife owned a present freehold estate during their marriage and that was inheritable by issue of the couple
      1. Dower and Coverture remain only in a few states and have been equalized where they still exist (and couples given choice of using the statutorily defined share instead)
   4. Obergefell gave same-sex couples right to marry, extending marital rights to these couples as well
3. **Separate property (41 states)**
   1. **During Marriage**: spouses own their property separately except to the extent that they choose to share it or mingle it together. Property owned before and earned during marriage belongs to each spouse individually; creditors cannot go after one spouse’s property to satisfy a debt undertaken by the other spouse. But, spouses do have an obligation to support each other.
   2. **On Divorce**: Equitable distribution of property considering: economic need—support for necessities and child support, status—maintaining the lifestyle shared during the marriage, rehabilitation—so one spouse can attain skills that support will no longer be needed, contributions of the parties and sometimes fault—some explicitly forbid considering fault. Specific factors include age, health, occupation, income, vocational skills, contribution as a homemaker, dissipation of property during the marriage, income tax consequences, debts, obligations prior to marriage and contributions of one spouse to the education of the other. Many allow for alimony payments as well—though less common as women join the workforce.
      1. Note: property acquired before the marriage is generally not included in the equitable distribution, rather each retained by the spouse that owns it—but will consider the extent that non-monetary contributions of the other spouse during the marriage contributed to the maintenance of the property
   3. **On Death**: most states have a forced share rule that allows the widowed spouse to override any will written and received a stated portion of the estate (but spouses are free to give away all of their property during their lifetime if they wish). If no will written, some give entire estate to surviving spouse, while some split it between them and surviving children
4. **Community property:**
   1. **During Marriage:** Property owned prior to marriage and property acquired by gift, devise, bequest or inheritance during marriage is separate. All other property acquired during marriage, including earnings, is community property and owned equally by both spouses. Split whether interest earned on separately owned property becomes jointly owned. Each spouse can deal with the property without consent of the other, but they have a fiduciary duty to each other to manage the property well. In addition, most states do require that both parties agree to convey or mortgage interests in real property and in assets in a business in which both spouses participate. As far as whether community property can be reached by creditors of individual spouses, different approaches: some states don’t allow unless both spouses consented to the transaction, others allow the property to be used to satisfy debts incurred by one spouse and others limit the portion of the property that can be reached
   2. **On Divorce:** most apply equitable distribution, a few apply a mechanical rule that gives each spouse his or her separate property and splits the community property in half
   3. **On Death:** spouse is allowed to dispose of all her separate property and ½ her community property by will
5. Other rules:
   1. **Prenups:** traditionally were unenforceable due to public policy, thought to make marriages unstable. Today generally upheld if voluntary and not otherwise against public policy. When considering whether it is voluntary courts might consider: if it was demanded shortly before the wedding, the relative sophistication of the parties, and whether the challenging party had reasonable time and means to access independent counsel. Most jurisdictions will not enforce agreements if they were unconscionable at the time of agreement, while a minority will also consider if unconscionable at the time of enforcement—especially if circumstances have changed. Some will simply invalidate ones that are not equitable or fair.
   2. **Homestead laws:** to protect the spouse from the deceased spouse’s creditors, allow the spouse to live in the family home for as long as she lives. Some require this property be registered before the protections attach and others set a limit on the value that is to be exempted from execution to pay debts
   3. **Dividing a family home:** tricky situations because selling the house is bad for children, but on hand—they each have a right to an equitable share in the house and often there are not enough assets in the marriage for one side to pay off the other. Also, the expenses of maintaining the house may be too burdensome on a couple whose expenses have risen since separating and selling house may be only way to give each of them economic impendence. Courts have taken different approaches: given solely to wife in best interests of minor children, forced sale over one party’s protest, forced sale over objections of both husband and wife, forced sale of mini-mansion because wife could buy a more modest house despite the fact that the husband was wealthy and could afford to make payments for the house
6. **O’Brien v. Obrien (NY):**
   1. **Woman was granted rights to her husband’s professional degree**—calculated worth comparing average income of college graduate with a general surgeon
      1. ***Outlier***, no other state high court has held that a professional degree itself is a piece of property
      2. But, some states have held that contributions towards receipt of the license and the opportunity cost of not pursuing greater earnings protentional to permit the other spouses education can be reflected in equitable distribution or marital payments
      3. Most permit division of “**enterprise goodwill**” which is the value of a business reputation that can be transferred on the market; while others hold that “**personal goodwill**” associated with an individual’s reputation and skill has a sale value as well and can be divided
   2. Should it be property?
      1. **Pros**: she contributed her time and money to enable him to get the degree (Locke); some amount of guesswork is not so uncommon in these areas, can view the salary in future as the “property.” Also, if follow concurrence, could always correct if the calculation was in error
      2. **Anti**: he put in the time and work making it part of his very personhood (Radin, Moore) and aren’t acquired by mere expenditure of money, unclear what money he will make or what job he will end up doing—guesswork; doesn’t have the resemble aspects of property—it isn’t tangible or transferable
7. **Unmarried couples**— different approaches taken by the courts:
   1. Early approach was to deny any remedy altogether—unmarried cohabitants violated public policy.
   2. A few states follow this, but almost all allow enforcement of some agreements to provide support in exchange for non-sexual services
      1. Some require agreements in **writing**, in NJ the statute of frauds requires contracts to provide support to unmarried partners to be in writing and signed by the promiser
      2. Other states allow for oral agreements but require the agreement to be **express**, rather than implied from the conduct of the parties
      3. **Watts v. Watts:** Others Provide for property distribution even though the parties were not legally married and did not enter into any explicit agreement pertaining to support or property rights
         * May be based on finding an implied agreement (**implied in fact**) or by imposing a constructive trust to avoid unjust enrichment (**implied in law**)/ partnership
         * Consider whether they held joint accounts or property in common, sacrificed paid employment for work in the home, worked in the other partner’s business and contributed financially to the purchase of property in the other partners name
      4. **Hard case:** When a couple lives together, and the couple breaks up, does the non-owner acquire any rights in the family home? In **Sullivan** court found that defendant had promised to put his partner on the title and that the plaintiff was practically induced to remain in the relationship in reliance on that promise, gave up employment opportunities to remain and did the homemaking. One half interest of house was in held in constructive trust for the benefit of the ex-partner, defendant would be unjustly enriched otherwise. But in later case court effectively established that just a relationship is not enough, must have relied creating a fiduciary duty

## Concurrent ownership—Partnerships and corporations

1. **Agency costs**: separation of ownership from control leads to competing interests, which results in increased costs
   1. The degree by which corporate mangers’ self-interest runs in line with those that have an ownership interest will affect how serious the divergence between the principal and the agent is (B&M—see b)
2. **Berle and Mean**: think of corporations as **quasi-public entities** that need to be **regulated** to ensure that directors use the resources of the company for their most efficient use (more searching judicial review)
   1. Concerned of the **high agency costs** that will occur due to conflicting interests between those that own the property and those that control it—managers might be incentivized to achieve short term gains that pad their pockets
   2. More in line w/ a modern theory some scholars take to this issue: **property-based approach**—places more focus on the organizational form of the corporate entity and the balance of rights between the owners and third parties affected by the activities of the corporation and its agents
      1. Not just focused on relationship of shareholders and management, but the relationship with third parties as well. Property rights are good against the world
         * Under this theory, all shareholders are looked at as co-owners in the assets of production and have responsibility for that—might even allow for shareholder liability
      2. Also, limits the forms in which property may be held—so property serves public interest and gives notice to whom may be affected by them. Focuses on the organizational form of the entity.
3. **Nexus of contracts theory** (Professor Butler): conceives of corporation as an efficient conduit through which parties make and organize vast numbers of private agreements— **capital markets** will discipline corporate managers, leaving little justification for further legal ordering to mediate the relationship between shareholders and managers. Agency costs will be minimized due to this.
   1. Corporations as a “firm:” set of relations that arise when resources are **allocated** amongst employees, rather than independent contractors; unified control reduces haggling & allows for quick changes
   2. **Efficient market hypothesis**—the price fully reflects all available information
   3. This view suggests less regulation, focusing on the freedom of **contract** (private nature)
      1. Counter: is it fair to simply view corporations as private parties entering into contracts, considering the limited liability the corporations have for non-consensual creditors—need to ensure that everyone’s interests are taken into account. There is a public nature of corporations—see Berle and Mean
4. **Controls of the directors:**
   1. Fiduciary duty: legal mechanism that controls the discretion of the mangers—they have to act in the best interests of the shareholders
      1. But, when company is sued by a shareholder, managements decisions receive extreme deference through the **business judgement rule—**as long as the **process** was rational or employed in a good faith effect to advance the corporation’s interest, will not be able to overcome the strong presumption that directors, not shareholders, run the company; court will not look into substantive context of their decisions (**Salsitz v. Ford)**
         * In line w/ the nexus of contract theory
      2. Fiduciary duty to shareholders, but what about other stakeholders like employees, bondholders, or even the local community? Some scholars have argued that fiduciary duties should extend to employees.
         * Perhaps more in line with the property based theories of corporations
   2. Corporations and business entities are also subject to federal and state oversight regulation, like the SEC.
      1. However, much of corporate law is permissive, which sometimes leads to shareholder activism—giving shareholders a more active role in the decisions (common with pension funds)
5. **Property in other common entity forms:**
   1. **Partnerships**: formed whenever there is “association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit” regardless of whether the parties recognize or intend that their actions form a partnership
      1. Agreement is necessary, but not in writing—can be created whenever individuals place their money, assets of labor or skill in commerce with the understanding that profits will be shared between them
      2. Absent other agreements, each partner has an equal right to possess the partnership property for partnership purposes and share in the profits of the partnership—since limited to the purposes of the partnership, partners do not have an individual interest in the partnership that may be sold to or inherited by others or reached by personal creditors of the partners
      3. General or limited partnership
         * Although a general partnership creates a separate legal entity, does not separate ownership from control
         * Limited partnerships divide ownership and control like a mini-corporation—contribute capital for share of profits, but don’t have right to manage or control partnership assets
         * LLP—not liable for partnership debts, a creditor and tort victim can only reach partnership assets and the assets of the partner personally responsible for the debt
   2. **LLC**—similar to Limited partnerships/LLP’s, but allow the managing members to retain limited liability while not giving up operational control
   3. **Trusts**: divide ownership from control through the separation of legal and beneficial ownership
      1. Often uses for estate planning, charities, RIET’s
   4. **Common interest developments:** also divides ownership from control
      1. Typically have owners associations governed by boards of directors charged with managing and enforcing the convents governing the development—Generally incorporated as non-for profit corporations
      2. While easier for shareholders to influence these board members than those that serve on corporate boards for companies, these decisions often directly affect the lives of those in the development, unlike w/ corporations
      3. Some apply the business judgement rule—see above

## Leasehold Estates

* Look out for how property law changes over time—towards a more **contractual** approach led by the **court**
* Also consider how much we should **limit the freedom** of parties to contract

1. Leasehold**:** landlord agrees to transfer possession of the property for a specified period to the tenant in return for the tenant’s promise to make a periodic rental payment. Possession reverts to landlord at the end of the tenancy. A lease is both a **conveyance** of a property interest as well as a **contract** between landlord and tenant
   1. **Term of Years:** Lasts for specified period of time determined by the parties. May terminate prior to the end of the fixed period upon happening of some event or condition. Landlord’s future interest is a **reversion**, but lease may also grant a **remainder** to third party. Death of either party does not terminate leasehold. Landlord may not evict prior to end of term unless tenant is breaching material term, such as the covenant to pay rent.
   2. **Periodic Tenancy:** Renew automatically at specified periods unless either landlord or tenant chooses to end the relationship. **Notice** is required prior to termination. Death of either party does not terminate. **Month-to-month** tenancies are a form of periodic tenancy. Many states require a month’s notice to end month to month tenancy; Uniform Residential Landlord Tenant Act (ULTRA) requires 60-day notice.
   3. **Tenancy at will:** Similar to periodic tenancy except it can be ended with **no notice** to either party. Most jurisdictions **now require notice by statute**, but tenancy at will may still be distinguishable from periodic tenancy in some instances where **death** of either landlord or tenant may terminate tenancy at will (important, because even if notice still required, has absolute right to evict tenant since tenancy at end, in contract to periodic tenancy where may not be able to terminate if tenant has a defense to eviction)
   4. **Tenancy at sufferance (holdover tenant):** Where a tenant who was rightfully in possession of a leasehold interest but wrongfully stays after the leasehold terminates. The term is intended to distinguish between tenant who wrongfully overstays and a trespasser. Different legal procedure for ejecting; need eviction proceeding followed by court judgment. Some states say if landlord continues to accept rent from holdover tenant, implies new lease term has begun.
2. **Note**: Same rules generally apply to commercial or residential leases, but courts more inclined to adopt common law rules regulating the terms of residential leases on the assumption that they have less bargaining power or expertise to shape contractual arrangements in their best interests than commercial tenants.

### Conflicts About Rent

1. **Stop Paying:** If tenant stops paying rent and stays on premises, may sue for back-rent and possession (eviction). Tenant may assert affirmative defenses based on common law doctrines or discrimination
2. **Holdover Tenant Keeps Paying:** If holdover tenant continues to pay, landlord may choose to accept new tenancy. Most states say it is periodic tenancy of month to month. Minority say new full term created if original tenancy was term of years. Landlord may sue for possession but in some states will have to stop accepting proffered checks to avoid creation of new tenancy. May also have to give notice as if a month-to-month tenancy if checks accepted. (can avoid this by suing immediately for possession and returning payment or cashing checks, but writing on back that not for new tenancy, but to cover the rental value of property from tenant at sufferance)
3. In almost all states, landlords barred from using self-help to evict – e.g. change locks (Berg v. Wiley). Old rule said self-help OK if peaceable rather than forcible.
   1. Certainly, in residential context and often in the commercial one as well
4. **Summary Proceedings/Forcible Entry and Detainer/Unlawful Detainer/Summary Ejectment**: Statutes limit the issues that can be addressed in lawsuit; so as to allow for fast judicial determination of the landlord’s claim of a right to regain possession
   1. **Traditional:** 2 claims (Rent passed due; tenant in possession post lease- term expired) and 2 defenses (Rent was paid; term hasn’t expired)
   2. **Today:**More defenses permitted, including implied warranty of habitability, retaliatory eviction, etc. Some still prevent these defenses in summary proceedings
   3. **Representation**: landlords more often represented by counsel than tenants; impacts outcomes

Landlord’s Duty to Mitigate**—**If tenant breaches lease for a term of years by stopping to pay and moving out before end of term, 3 options:

1. **Accept tenant’s surrender.** Tenant’s departure an implied offer to end the term of years. Landlord can accept, and still sue for back rent owed but not paid for the time prior to tenant’s abandonment, but not for future rent. Though, he can sue for damages—agreed upon rental price minus the fair market price of rent currently + cost of search; if >0 will not need to pay damages
2. **Re-let on Tenant’s Account.** Refuse to accept surrender by giving notice. Look for new tenant and re-let. When new tenant is found, landlord may sue for damages for difference between new rent and old rent (and for finding new tenant). New rent must be reasonable.
   1. Not always clear how a landlord can make clear that not accepting the surrender (make it explicit)
   2. Implications of accepting surrender or not: Assume 1-year tenant moves out after 6 months, and new tenant is month-to-month and moves out after 4 months and landlord cannot find someone to replace the last 2 months or what if the new tenant fails to pay part of rent for some reason.
3. Wait and sue for rent at end of term vs. mitigate damages**.** Almost all states reject the traditional rule (some still have it). Have held landlords have duty to mitigate damages (but **not all states**—see NY, PA, Restatement)
   1. Leaseholds increasingly considered under **contract law** rather than property law, which considered them conveyances of a property interest (and therefore allowed landlord to wait and sue—as he had given exclusive control to the tenant)
   2. If landlord does mitigate, still collects for the reasonable costs of finding a new tenant, the rent for the premises while the premises were vacant as the landlord looked for a new tenant and the difference between the rental price and the new rent if lower than previously
   3. Free not to mitigate, but then can only collect for reasonable amount in finding a replacement and the difference in market rent and contract rent provided for in their rental agreement. However, **ULTRA** stipulates that if landlord fails to undertake reasonable efforts to mitigate, rental agreement is deemed to be terminated and the landlord cannot recover damages past that point.
4. Arguments for and against **duty to mitigate**:
   1. **For**: More **efficient** for landlords to rent premises than leave them vacant. Ability to still get expectation damages if new rent is lower + collect for finding another tenant, means landlord will be same position otherwise would have been, and the tenant is better off as well. Promotes **social wealth** by not wasting scarce resources with vacant apartments and allows **tenant to not be locked into a lease**—allowing them to move elsewhere to perform a job, for example
   2. **Against**: LL bargained for right not to have to look for another tenant. If tenant unwilling to compensate landlord for right to terminate lease early, the cost to landlord could outweigh the benefit to the tenant.
5. **Acceleration Clause** – makes remainder of rent due if tenant breaches or abandons premises. Liquidated damages—allows for landlord to collect immediately (not wait until end of term) and lease apartment out to other tenants. Courts scrutinize as they would any other LD clause – must reasonably reflect actual damages likely to suffer because of breach, otherwise an unenforceable penalty or unconscionable. The clause does not waive duty to mitigate and the accelerated rent damages will be reduced by what could be avoided by re-letting.
6. **Burden of proof**: majority rule like *Sommer* (landlord’s burden to show reasonable efforts), at least for residential leases—must show tried to mitigate and the amount lost because of inability to mitigate. Commercial leases generally put burden of proof on tenant
7. **Sommer v. Kridel** (N.J. 1977) **(LL Duty to Mitigate)**
   1. **Facts:** tenant leased unit, but before moving in told LL that would not be taking the apartment and tried replacing himself with someone who was denied; LL did not try to re-let the apartment for some time
   2. **Holding:** D relieved of duty to continue paying rent- P could have avoided the damages that accrued.
   3. **Rule:** A landlord has a duty to mitigate damages where he seeks to recover rents due from a defaulting tenant. Landlord’s duty to mitigate consists of making reasonable efforts to re-let the apartment.
   4. **Landlord’s burden** to show efforts were reasonable.
      1. **Factors to consider:** whether attempted personally or through an agency to show apartment to prospective tenants; whether advertised in newspaper; etc. Tenant may attempt to rebut by showing he proffered suitable tenants who were rejected. No standard formula.
   5. **Justifications:**
      1. No reason to let valuable rental space lie fallow and “force” a tenant to stay. Incentivize landlords to seek new tenants – promotes asset utilization/efficiency.
      2. Fairness concern about letting assets lie fallow in housing shortage, and frustrating reasonable expectations of parties.
         * Think **Mount Laurel** (NJ also)—housing is important right that we want accessible to all
   6. Court acknowledges that while weight of authority supports rule that landlord has no duty to mitigate, ordinary contract principles are being incorporated into property law. Concerned with intention of parties
      1. **Other trends re: contract law/property** law – implied warranties of fitness/habitability; mutual dependency of covenants, etc.

### Occupancy

1. **Initial occupancy: Landlords Duty to Deliver Possession:**
   1. Landlord has the duty to deliver possession of the rented premises to the tenant at the beginning of the leasehold
      1. If prior tenant refuses to leave, the landlord has a duty to remove them within a reasonable amount of time through eviction proceedings or by convincing them to leave
      2. If not delivered on time—tenant can either terminate the lease and recover damages as compensation for finding another place to live; or affirm the lease, not pay for rent while not occupying premises and get damages for the cost of temporarily renting alternative housing while the landlord seeks to remove the previous tenant
      3. **Minority of courts**: LL only has duty to deliver the right to possession and not actual—if there is a holdover tenant, incoming tenant must personally evict the tenant and pay rent to LL in meantime—can only recover from the tenant
2. **Occupancy during the leasehold:**
   1. **Landlords right to inspect and repair—**Uniform Residential Landlord and tenant Act
      1. Tenant cannot unreasonably withhold consent to the landlord to enter into the dwelling unit in order to inspect the premises, exhibit it to prospective or actual purchasers, or make needed repairs/improvements
         * Cannot abuse the right or use to harass tenant—unless in case of emergency or it is impracticable to do so, must give two days’ notice and only come by at reasonable times
         * Can enter w/o consent in case of emergency
   2. **Tenant’s Right to Receive Visitors and to Marry:** Tenants have a nondisclaimable right to receive visitors; also, has right to live w/ one’s spouse
      1. Outside of that, unclear to what degree a landlord can restrict who can live w/ tenant
   3. **Tenant’s duties not to commit waste or cause a nuisance:** landlords have right to have the premises intact and not damaged, subject to normal wear and tear—can evict if breach this duty
   4. **Tenant’s use restrictions and obligations:**
      1. **Use Restrictions:** many residential leases limit the uses for residential purposes; unclear whether home businesses violate this provision—courts generally view the restriction narrowly, but might find breach if somewhat substantial business
      2. **Covenants to operate:** sometimes they also may be affirmatively obligated to continue a use contemplated in the lease—might for example lease a plot of land to be used as a gas station for 20 years with rent set at a % of gasoline delivered w/ 1k base rent.
         * If base rate is considered substantial based on the FMV of the property in question—courts will generally refuse to interpret these leases to imply that the lessor had a duty to continuously operate the business
         * If it isn’t significant—will find an implied covenant to continue to operate. Will also enforce if express
         * While courts will enforce covenants to operate, they will not force an unprofitable business to operate. They are also likely not to grant injunctive relief, but limit the **remedies to damages**—don’t want to be controlling businesses
      3. **Anchor stores:** does an anchor store intended to attract customers to the mall have a duty to continue to operate?
         * One court found it did, despite any affirmative obligation mentioned in the lease—implied obligation of good faith—breached lease because didn’t continue to operate or find a new subtenant. Other courts have disagreed.
3. **Transfers of Landlord’s leasehold interest-** if landlord transfers their interest in the property, then the new landlord has all the same rights and obligations as previous landlord—current leases still survive.
   1. If landlord loses property due to foreclosure—if the lease was prior to the debt, then the lease takes priority, but if vice versa, then mortgage takes priority—leases will expire with the foreclosure (similar to when lease property from someone with a life estate)
4. Assigning and Subleasing
   1. **Rule:** Tenant can generally transfer all or a portion of her possessory interest in the premises unless he specifically limits this right.
      1. **Clauses prohibiting subletting or assignment are enforceable** – protect landlord from being forced to accept less creditworthy subtenants. Can evict the tenant for breach.
      2. Traditional doctrine held that, in order to promote alienability, leases limiting subletting but not assignment will be strictly construed not to limit assignment. Modern trend is to focus on intent of parties, and since subletting commonly means any transfer of leasehold interest, clause prohibiting subletting prohibits both subletting and assignment.
   2. **Assignment:** Assignment generally conveys *all* tenant’s remaining property interests without retaining any future rights to enter
      1. Assignment satisfies **strict vertical (and horizontal) privity of estate** LL>>T1>>T2. Covenant in original lease “run with the land” even though **no privity of contract** between T2 and LL.
      2. **LL can sue T2 for damages if T2 breaches** covenant. LL also liable to T2 for breach of LL covenants.
      3. **LL can always sue T1 for damages** – e.g. unpaid rent – because in **privity of contract**. Doesn’t matter how many successive assignments there are.
   3. **Sublease:** Under a sublease, tenant retains some future interest or right to control the property in future.
      1. Considered like **equitable servitude**. T2 does **not** have privity of estate with LL if LL>>T1>>T2.
      2. LL may sue for **equitable relief** to enforce lease covenants. So long as tenant has notice of lease covenants in the original lease, most courts hold LL may sue T2 to enjoin T2 if breach.
         * Court is likely to find T2 on inquiry notice of the covenants in the original lease – reasonable subtenant would inquire whether tenant had made promises to landlord restricting use of the premises.
         * Courts split on whether can get *injunction* ordering T2 to pay rent. But some courts say an injunction to pay rent is equivalent to awarding damages, and do not allow such relief.
      3. **LL can always sue T1 for unpaid rent.** Doesn’t matter how many successive subleases there are (T1 is then entitled to recover from the subtenant)
         * But cannot sue the subtenant for unpaid rent that is owed to him for past non-payment
         * Exception: If T2 *expressly* promises to T1 to pay rent to LL, LL *may* be able to sue T2 as a **third-party beneficiary** to the contract between T1 and T2.
      4. **LL can also evict T1, in which case T2’s right to possession is terminated.**
   4. **Landlord Consent:** Many leases provide for subletting or assignment *only with landlord’s consent.* Question whether criterion of “reasonableness” should be implied. (Kendall)
      1. **Often required in commercial leases. Not in residential leases.**
         * Reasonableness requirement derived from implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in all contracts and justified with common law prejudice against restraints on alienation.
      2. What is “reasonable”?
         * **See factor test in Kendall:** financial responsibility of subtenant; legality and suitability of proposed use; nature of occupancy; need for alterations
         * Tenet Healthsystem Surgical LLC: Where landlord denied consent to assign a lease that would bring competitor into immediate area where landlord does business, court held only reasons are factors “that relate to landlord’s interest in preserving the leased property or in having the terms of the prime lease be performed” e.g. financial responsibility of subtenant, legality and suitability of proposed use, nature of occupancy, etc. **Concern about competition not reasonable.**
      3. ***Kendall v. Ernest Pestana, Inc:***  Consent to Assignment – Consent Can only be withheld if commercially reasonable
         * **Issue:** Whether in the absence of a provision that such consent will not be unreasonably withheld, a lessor may unreasonably and arbitrarily withhold his or her consent to an assignment (LL didn’t consent here, even though tenant tried assigning to someone w/ better financial standing)
         * **Holding: *Where lease provides for assignment only with prior consent of the lessor, such consent may be withheld only where the lessor has a commercially reasonable objection*** to the assignment. Holding limited to commercial lease context.
           + Majority rule at time allowed for arbitrary refusal—since revisionary interest, hostility towards restrain on alienation was not as strong
           + With new rule, court recognized “dual nature of a lease as a conveyance of a leasehold interest and a contract.”
           + Note: parties can still contract out of this requirement
         * ***Factor test for reasonableness – financial responsibility of proposed assignee; suitability of the use; legality of the proposed use; need for alteration of premises; nature of occupancy.***
           + Denying for personal taste, convenience, sensibility or landlord desire to charge higher rent are not good reasons.
         * **Justifications for New Rule:**
           + Permitting reasonable alienation of commercial space increasingly necessary in urban society
           + *Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing* in every contract – no party should act to deny the other party of their right to receive the fruits of the contract. Requiring discretionary power to be exercised in accordance with commercially reasonable standards ensures this implied covenant won’t be violated.
         * **Responses to Justifications for Old Rule**
           + Freedom of ownership and control inherent to property rights, includes freedom to look to no one but the lessee for rent. Response: (1) Undermined by adoption of duty to mitigate damages; (2) Right still protected by permitting commercially reasonable grounds for refusing assignment/subletting; (3) Original lessee remains a guarantor.
           + Lessee could have bargained for reasonableness requirement in contract. Response: Language does not clearly and unambiguously permit arbitrary refusal of consent. Good faith/fair dealing strongly suggest arbitrariness is not sufficient.
           + Stare decisis/reliance on rules. Response: majority rule not universal, new trend
           + Right to realize increase in value. Response: Lessee takes downside if agrees to rent above market and should also benefit from upside if rent below market. Landlord agreed to dispose of possession and could not have reasonably anticipated to get more than agreed rent. Revisionary estate will also benefit from increased value in future.
         * **Dissent:** Weight of authority points other way. Not as **administrable** as old rule**.**
      4. ***Slavin v. Rent Control Board of Brookline*** (Mass. 1990)
         * **Held:** No obligation to act reasonably when withholding consent in residential leases.
         * **Justification:** Major concerns in commercial lease context not present in present case
           + Unlike Kendall, no concern about LL seeking unfair financial gain if apartment is rent controlled (as was the case here)
           + Unlike Kendall, not concerned about urbanization requiring greater degree of alienability. Previous Mass. case held provisions requiring LL consent with no limitation on ability to refuse did not restrain alienation
           + Legislature can take it up. Concerned about plethora of litigation.
         * **Note**: Mass. SJC later extended holding in Slavin to commercial context, imputing no obligation of reasonableness into clauses requiring landlord consent to an assignment or sublease.

### Constructive Eviction, Implied Warranty of Habitability (Retaliatory Eviction)

1. **Actual eviction** – landlord breaches the lease by physically barring tenant from the property – e.g. putting new locks on doors. Tenant may sue landlord for damages for trespass and may seek injunction ordering landlord to re-convey possession.
   1. **Partial actual eviction:** if tenant only barred from part of the property, it’s a breach & can move out w/o being liable for rent. If tenant chooses to stay, traditional rule relieved tenant completely of duty to pay, while modern approach is to abate the rent to fair market value of property as is
2. Constructive Eviction**:** Where tenants have to endure “**substantial interference with quiet enjoyment of the premises**”, may claim they were constructively evicted (*East Haven*).
   1. **Implied Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment:** Landlord impliedly promises not to disturb the tenant’s quiet use and enjoyment of the property.
   2. **Constructive eviction** may be asserted as affirmative defense or as a cause of action against LL’s
      1. To establish the claim, must claim the interreference with **quiet enjoyment** was so substantial that nobody in his right mind would stay there and it is as if the landlord actually barred the tenant from entering into the premises.
      2. Traditional rule is that tenant can raise defense of constructive eviction **only if he moves out** within a reasonable period of time. By tenant staying, showed was not serious enough to justify a tenant breaching and not paying rent
   3. If only portion of property effected, **partial constructive eviction** allows tenant to stay on part of premises from which the tenant does not claim to have been constructively evicted
      1. Must show substantial interference with use and enjoyment of the portion of property at issue; and traditionally must have actually vacated that part of the property
      2. Requiring tenants to move out in case of partial constructive eviction is unfair given clear effect of “major shortage’ in residential housing has been to drastically undermine the bargaining power of tenants in relation to landlords.
   4. **2nd restatement:**
      1. Doesn’t require substantial interference, just “more than insignificant.”
      2. Don’t need to abandon the premises b/f taking advantage of constructive eviction rule
      3. LL liable not just for his actions, but also actions by third parties performed on “property in which the LL has an interest, which conduct could be legally controlled by him”
         * Traditional rule only applied to acts by LL or someone acting under him, unless the lease said otherwise
   5. Landlord may be liable for **damages** to tenant under constructive eviction doctrine
      1. Rent abatement, proportional to portion of property no longer usable (Minjack)
      2. Punitive damages if wanton disregard for health and safety of tenants (Minjack)
      3. “all losses which he can prove he has actually sustained, or which he will necessarily sustain, under the circumstances, as a result of the unlawful eviction.” (3000 B.C.)
   6. Note, with creation of the warranty of habitability, this doctrine is generally used in cases where LL interferes with the quiet enjoyment of property due to **noise, harassment or perhaps sexual assault**, and not the physical condition of the premises (especially in states that base the warranty on housing codes)
      1. Or for commercial tenants, where warranty of habitability may not apply
   7. **Tenants have obligations** not to disturb the quiet enjoyment of other tenants and could be evicted if they breach—duty found in deeds and state laws
      1. If rises to level of nuisance, other tenants may have remedies for damages/ injunctive relief
   8. ***Minjack v. Randolph*** (NY App. Div. 1988) **(Constructive Eviction for Portion of Leasehold)**
      1. **Holding:** Constructive eviction may be invoked even if had to abandon only a portion of the premises. Tenants were compelled to abandon the music studio portion of the loft due to LL’s wrongful acts, which “substantially & materially deprived them of the beneficial use & enjoyment of that portion of the loft.”
         * **Remedy:** Partial, rather than complete, abatement of rent.
      2. **Punitive Damages**: Permissible to award punitive damages when to do so would “deter morally culpable conduct.” Here, clear wanton disregard for safety of others in the way that construction was carried out, & in how LL evinced clear indifference to health & safety of tenants.
      3. ***East Haven Associates v. Gurian***: tenants may establish a defense of partial constructive eviction for not paying rent where tenants can show the landlord’s action have “substantially deprived the tenant of the use and enjoyment of a portion of the property.”
         * Tenants who assert constructive eviction defense and stop paying rent are allowed to stay on the remaining part of the premises from which the tenant does not claim to have been constructively evicted.
         * “makes no sense at all to say that if part of an apartment has been rendered uninhabitable, a family must move from the entire dwelling before it can seek justice and fair dealing.”
   9. ***3000 B.C. v. Bowman Properties Ltd:*** constructive eviction for commercial LL—liable for **3rd parties**
      1. **Holding:** Constructive eviction occurred due to construction workers and children playing above. Court must determine what financial position of 3000 B.C. would have been if not for the constructive eviction.
      2. **Damages:** For purposes of damages, treated like a contract action – “restore the injured party to the financial position it would have achieved had the contract been fulfilled.”
         * Losses from start of noise, evacuation and moving expenses, attorneys’ fees, additional rent, reputation costs.
3. Implied Warranty of Habitability: Obligates landlords to provide premises that are safe and suitable for habitation. Breach of the warranty entitles tenants to move out before the end of the lease term, or to stay and either stop paying rent or pay a reduced rent until the improper conditions of the premises are fixed.
   1. Old rules: viewed it as property transfer, not as a contract
      1. No implied representations that apartment was habitable, and no duty to repair. Only duty was to fix latent defects known to them and not easily discoverable. (**Caveat Lessee**)
      2. Viewed lease agreements unlike other contracts— obligations to perform were not contingent on the other party’s performance; requirement to pay rent was **independent** of landlord’s performance and adherence to covenants, like duty to repair. Constructive eviction was the only way out—couldn’t withhold rent
         * Some jurisdictions still hold covenants in **commercial** leases are independent rather than dependent (NY). Most say dependent (MA)
   2. Warranty applies in almost all states for residential tenancies. **Not waivable, in most jurisdictions, in residential leases** – paternalistic, but warranted because otherwise tenants would always waive (no real choice given bargaining position.)
      1. **Similar reasons given for why other property rights non-waivable:**
         * ***State v. Schack*** – migrant workers would always waive access to essential services given weak bargaining position.
         * If one party waives, precedent would be set for the rest of the market to follow – imposes externalities on neighbors
         * **Radin:** Habitable dwelling an inalienable right – right to livable dwelling tied up in notion of personhood. Wouldn’t waive it if on equal footing with LL.
      2. If it is waivable (in some states), it is a **presumption or default** rule courts will assume to be in the contract in the absence of language to the contrary.
      3. **Most jurisdictions do not hold *commercial* leases contain implied warranties.** Jurisdictions that hold implied warranties do exist in commercial leases also make them **disclaimable**.
   3. Some states measure landlords’ obligations based on reference to state or local housing codes; other courts measure the LL’s obligations independently of the housing codes, holding that LL’s have an obligation to conform with general community standards of suitability for occupancy
      1. **Examples** that are likely to violate warranty: lack of heat/ hot water, broken windows, pest infestation and leaky roofs
      2. Also, duty to maintain common areas, assume duty to repair—must do so non-negligently
      3. If LL fails to provide a necessary service, many courts hold that warranty isn’t violated until the LL has been notified of the problem and has a reasonable opportunity to fix it and did not do so; but some find breach the moment the condition occurs
   4. **Remedies if Breach of implied warranty of habitability**
      1. Rescission or right to move out before end of term: Tenant may repudiate contract if landlord is in breach of covenant, even when change in material conditions would not amount to constructive eviction. If tenant moves out early, and LL sues, tenant can assert LL violated implied warranty of habitability as affirmative defense.
      2. Rent withholding: If LL in breach, right to stop paying rent & continue living there. Breach may be raised as defense in eviction proceeding or claim for back rent. Distinguishes implied warranty of habitability from constructive eviction – latter ordinarily requires tenant to move out to become entitled to stop paying rent (traditional rule)
         * Consult statute: some require tenant to give notice of defect prior to rent withholding. Some require complaint to be verified by inspector. Some require rent to be paid into escrow (Always a good idea to pay into escrow if withholding, in case you lose.)
      3. Rent abatement: If breach, right to reduced rent. May elect not to withhold but sue for declaratory judgment and ask landlord to reimburse for all or portion of rent paid during period of breach. More common to withhold and wait to be sued. If defect serious, will get to keep all unpaid rent. If less serious, may have to pay portion.
         * Amount to be withheld often based on FMV test: amount owed as rent during the breach is simply the FMV of property with the defect. Others simply mark down the rent by a & depending on the seriousness of the defect
      4. Repair and deduct: Tenant may repair and deduct cost of repair from rent. Some statutes limit by how much.
      5. Injunctive relief/specific performance: Some states allow tenant to sue for injunction to get landlord to comply with code.
      6. Administrative Remedies: In some states, may call upon inspector to inspect premises, assess repairs to be made, and order landlord to pay. Inspectors may initiate suits for civil damages which would be paid to state or sue for injunctive relief
      7. Criminal Penalties: Some landlords face criminal liability if fail to fix dangerous and unlawful conditions. (Judges have ordered landlords to live in buildings as punishment).
      8. Compensatory Damages: Usually breach of warranty is an affirmative defense to claims for back rent. But may also be cause of action or counterclaim. Most jurisdictions limit recovery to agreed-upon rent but some allow for damages greater than the rent (cost of staying in hotel, loss of property etc.)
   5. Breach for events beyond control of LL? Park West Management Corp v. Mitchell (1979): when owner’s staff went on strike and garbage piled up, tenants withheld rent and won in suit for back-rent claiming breach of warranty. Owner found responsible for conditions—**acts of third parties and natural disasters** are included in the scope of the warranty
   6. **ULTRA (pg. 886):** §2.104(a) – landlord to maintain premises up to code, make repairs, etc; **§3.101** – tenant obligations to maintain dwelling unit, not disturb neighbors; **§4.101** – noncompliance by landlord in general – conditions for termination (cannot terminate if remedied by time given in notice). Allows for damages and injunctive relief. Notice required; **§4.103** – tenant self-help if cheap repair, with landlord bearing the costs (may recover damages); **§4.104** – Failure to provide essential services (heat, hot water), tenant may take steps to procure from alternative source or to stay in substitute housing and recover reasonable costs incurred. May deduct from rent. May recover damages based on diminution of FMV; **§4.105** – Landlord noncompliance as defense to action for possession or rent.
   7. ***Javins v. First National Realty Corp.*** (D.C. Cir. 1970) **(Implied Warranty of Habitability)**
      1. **Issue:** Whether housing code violations which rise during the term of a lease have any effect upon the tenant’s obligation to pay rent.
      2. **Holding (J. Wright):** Warranty of habitability, measured by the standards set out in the Housing Regulations for D.C., is implied by operation of law into leases of urban dwelling units covered by those regulations & that beach of this warranty gives rise to the usual remedies for breach of k.
      3. Court found it had duty to “reappraise old doctrines” of property law in light of “the facts and values of contemporary life.” Necessary to “preserve continued vitality of common law.”
      4. **Factual assumptions underlying rigid rules have changed.**
         * Agricultural context out of which property law emerged assumed bulk of value in leasehold was in land, not dwelling. Tenants also were generally equipped to fix problems with dwelling.
         * Now, primary concern is about having a place to live, and apartment dweller not equipped to repair defects. Usual city-dweller has single, specialized skill unrelated to maintenance, and is unable to obtain financing for major repairs. Common law rule imposing obligation on lessee to repair during lease term was ‘never really intended to apply to residential urban leaseholds.”
         * Law has been changing since 19th century – cite case of striking down old rule requiring tenant to pay rent even if any building on the land was destroyed.
      5. **New sources of law available for invocation into this case (contracts, torts)**
         * People buying cars cannot be expected to have knowledge or capacity to make adequate inspection. Hence, we place liability on seller to warrant it is fit for designed purpose. Same should be true of landlords, who are better positioned perceive and prevent risks associated with product than buyer. Caveat Venditor.
         * Inequality of bargaining power between LL and T well documented. Housing shortage. Transactions costs.
      6. **Housing Codes imply a warranty of habitability**
         * Brown v. Southall: Landlord knew at time lease was signed code violations existed. Lease void under contract law. If illegal lease, reverts to month-to-month. If you stay, pay month. Given Brown, “untenable to find that this [code] has no effect on the contract after it has been signed.”
         * *In Brown, lease was invalid. Here, valid lease was breached.*
      7. **Note** that code is designed for purposes of inspections. Inspectors enforce it. Not passed to be read into lease contracts.
         * To what extent is it “appropriate” to read private right of action into code designed to instruct inspectors? Decentralizes the enforcement mechanism. Gives private parties incentive to work it out and give tenants the right to withhold rent to force landlord to negotiate. Centralized enforcement mechanism was inadequate.
         * **Judicial activism**? Think Brandies in ***INS v. AP***
           + Afterwards judge quoted as saying that saw a grave injustice & couldn’t follow the legal precedents that cooperated in creating that conditions that were unjust
      8. **Note:**Didn’t assert constructive eviction defense because (a) hadn’t moved; (b) not uninhabitable in that it isn’t true that “no one in the right mind” would want to live on premises.
      9. **Note:** Holding effects only eviction for nonpayment of rent; as soon as landlord repairs, rent becomes due. Landlord is free to seek eviction at termination of lease or on any other legal ground.
      10. **Administrability** – eviction proceedings “more drawn out” now that tenants can assert violation of housing code or analogous failures as defense for nonpayment, even where premises are habitable.
4. **Retaliatory Eviction:** LL may not evict a tenant in retaliation for tenant’s exercise of a right **incidental to the tenancy** (like exerting right protected by the implied warranty)
   1. How long may the tenant stay? Most courts hold landlord may not evict the tenant or refuse to renew a lease unless can show a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason.
      1. Some states expressed concern w/ this approach—allowed LL to evict tenant once the required repairs were done. But, must give the tenant a reasonable time to find another residence (Overall, states have many different statutes with different rules—some setting a specific time limit, some differentiating between month-to-month & term leases)
   2. DC Circ. In *Edwards v. Habib* court concluded that to allow retaliatory evictions would jeopardize efficacy of building codes.
   3. Protected tenant activity expanded to include attempts to organize to protect rights (Hillview) and press complaints. Even where tenant’s activity only indirectly related to relationship between landlord and tenant
   4. **Remedies:** tenant may recover possession, terminate lease, and recover damages
      1. But note, LL can recover possession if the violation of the housing code was caused by lack of reasonable care by the tenant, the tenant is default on rent or compliance with the building code requires remodeling which would effectively deprive the tenant of use of the dwelling unit
   5. **Tenant Screening:** minor disputes resulting in judgments against a tenant can impact tenant’s credit score and can end up on a landlord’s blacklist. Chilling effect?

**Collection of thoughts about corporations, marital property and Leaseholds**

* The way the court view property and the interest at hand, will affect how the decisions unfold
* Corporations: nexus of contracts is dominant view, but in some argue should take a more property-based approach that looks at the people involved in a corporation as common owners, each of which is keeping some stick in that bundle of entitlement
* Marital Property: if view the license as a thing—as property—that will end up on one side or other, will end up different then if think of property as a bundle that one can get one strand and give up another
* Landlord tenant law: new implied warranty of habitability, not just a conveyance, but a contract itself; how would viewing it as a property right change the analysis?

## Fair Housing Law

1. Why fair housing law?
   1. **Rights**: Housing as a human right, a part of a person—housing is a huge part of all of us, important that all equal access to housing
      1. **Counter**: Compromises autonomy of property owners, they should have the right to exclude—even when they are selling (& identity interest involved as well, especially in roommate context
   2. **Efficiency**: Increase alienability—forces people to open the property to a larger market, and no pressure on people in white neighborhoods to only sell to whites
      1. **Counter:** Protect settled expectations- people relied on living in a certain type of neighborhood
2. **Key Provisions (1018)**
   1. §3601: Purpose – to provide fair housing within constitutional limits
   2. §3602: Definitions
      1. (b) **Dwelling** means any building structure, or portion thereof which is occupied as, or designed or intended for occupancy as, a residence by one or more families, and any vacant land which is offered for sale or lease for the construction or location thereon of any such building, structure, or portion thereof.
      2. (c) Family includes a single individual
      3. (e) To rent includes to lease and sublease
      4. (k) Familial status: means one or more individuals (who have not attained the age of 18 years) being domiciled with (1) a parent or another person having legal custody of such individual or individuals; or (2) the designee of such parent or other person having such custody, with the written permission of such parent or other person.
         * Protections against discrimination on basis of familial status shall apply to any person who is pregnant or in process of securing legal custody of someone not yet 18
   3. §3603: Exemptions: Nothing in Section 3604 of this title **other than subsection (c)** shall apply to
      1. (1) any **single family house sold or rented by an owner**: *Provided*, that such private individual owner does not own more than three such single-family houses at any one time: *Provided further,* That after Dec. 31, 1969, the sale or rental of any such single family house shall be excepted from the application of this subchapter *only if* such house is sold or rented (A) without the use in any manner of the sales or rental facilities or the sales or rental services of any real estate broker, agent, or salesman, or of such facilities or services of any person in the business of selling or renting dwellings, or of any employee or agent of any such broker, agent, salesman, or person and (B) without the publication, posting, or mailing, after notice, of any advertisement or written notice in violation of section 3604(c) of this title, or
         * Drafters noted at time that this was needed to avoid the wrath of the homeowners
      2. (2) rooms or units in dwellings containing living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than **four families** living independently of each other, if the **owner** actually maintains and occupies one of such living quarters as his residence.
         * Shouldn’t effectively be forced to live w/ those they do not want to, gets too close and too intimate—that is part of their identity as well
   4. §3604: Unlawful to:
      1. **(a) To refuse to sell or rent** after the making of a bona fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or **otherwise make unavailable** or deny, a dwelling to any person because of **race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin**.
         * “Unavailable” been read to include zoning, steering, vibes
      2. **(b)** To discriminate against any person in the **terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental** of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of **race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin**.
      3. **(c) To make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin, or an intention to make any such preference, limitation, or discrimination.**
         * [Even subtle signaling may violate 3604(c) (Ragin v. New York Times)— jury question if always using white models in real estate adds indicated that had racial preference]
         * Odd that 3604 applies even to those who are exempted under 3603(b). Rule that prohibits truthful advertising of a transaction that would be substantively lawful raises free speech concerns (Easterbrook)]
         * Difficult to enforce against discriminatory advertising in internet age.
      4. **(d)** To **represent** to any person because of **race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin** that any dwelling is **not available** for inspection, sale, or rental when such dwelling is in fact so available.
         * Racial steering: when realtors show people of different races different areas and not telling minorities about available housing in certain areas
      5. **(e)** For profit, to induce or attempt to induce any person to sell or rent any dwelling by **representations regarding the entry or prospective entry** into the neighborhood of a person or persons of a particular **race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin**
      6. **(f)** **(1) To discriminate in the sale or rental**, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a **handicap** of— **(A)** that buyer or renter, **(B)** a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available; or **(C)** any person associated with that buyer or renter. **(2)**To discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling, because of a handicap of—**(A)** that person; or **(B)** a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available; or **(C)** any person associated with that person.
         * **[Handicap may include AIDS/HIV]**
         * (3) Defines what is discrimination in relation to a handicapped person here
   5. §3605: Discrimination in residential real estate-related transactions
      1. (a) unlawful for any person/entity whose business includes residential real estate to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction.
   6. §3607: Exemptions
      1. (a) Religious organizations and private clubs.
      2. (b) Doesn’t limit the applicability of any reasonable local or state law limiting the maximum amount of persons permitted to occupy a dwelling
      3. (b) when housing is for older residents (won’t need to let in children)
   7. §3613: Enforcement by private persons
      1. (a)(1)(a) An aggrieved person may commence a civil action in an appropriate United States district/state court within 2 years after occurrence.
         * “Aggrieved:” injured by discrimination or believes they are about to be
      2. (c) Relief: (1) actual damages (2) punitive damages (3) temporary or permanent injunction (4) restraining order; also, reasonable attorney’s fees if appropriate (lodestar calculation)
   8. §3617: unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten or interfere with exercise of enjoyment of right in FHA
      1. Many cases involve neighbors and debate in court if applies only pre-purchase or even after (7th circuit applies even after)
3. ***Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Rommate.com, LLC*** (9th Cir. 2012) **(Advertising)**
   1. **Facts:** FHCsued Roommate.com alleging websites questions requiring disclosure of sex, sexual orientation and familial status, and its sorting/matching functionality to designate roomates, violate FHA §3601 (and California statute as well.) District court enjoined Roommate.com’s sorting activities.
      1. **Relevant statutry language:** 3604(c) re: making/printing/publishing language. 3604(c) applies universally—no exemptions, but statute only applies to **“dwellings”**
   2. **Case turns interpretation of “dwelling” in 3604. Turn to Canons of Interpretation**
      1. **Plain Meaning:** Dwelling = any building, structure, or “portion thereof” occupied as a residence by 1+ families (which could mean single person). Unclear if this could mean “bedroom + common access room” or “bottom bunk”? Unlikely (more like dwelling means independent living unit) but also unclear. Move to next canon.
      2. **Context in statute and legislative history (purpose):** Could Congress have really intended, in 1968, for the statute to protect the right of nonmarried males to live with nonmarried females? Would violate social mores at time.
         * At the same time, sex only added later, when originally written, were only thinking about race. Reason to think Congress would want the statute to apply differently to race v. sex?
         * Also, statute has an entire provision re: exceptions, and roommates not among them. *Expression unius* – roommates not exempted
         * Court says still reading is unlikely but not implausible, so move to next canon.
      3. **Constitutional avoidance** – if there is a plausible reading of a statute that avoids a constitutional issue, apply that reading.
         * Construing “dwelling” to mean shared room would raise constitutional problems – freedom to associate/not to associate with certain people is protected. “The freedom to enter into and carry on certain intimate or private relationships is a fundamental element of liberty protected by the Bill of Rights.”
         * “The right to associate also implies the right *not* to associate.” Orthodox Jew has right to not live with someone who eats ham.
      4. 4) **Interpret remedial statute broadly** – if statute remedies social ill, construe it broadly. But court does not consider this.
   3. **Holding:** “Because the construction of dwelling to include shared living units raises substantial constitutional concerns, we adopt the narrower construction that excludes roommate selection from the reach of the FHA”. Hence, not unlawful to discriminate in selecting a roommate
      1. Odd that case is about **advertising** under 3604(c), but the court rules on whether one is entitled to discriminate in selecting a roommate…
      2. Akin to *Ely* (Boy Scout’s Case) – public accommodations question but decided on freedom of association grounds.
      3. HUD still seems to believe discriminatory advertising about roommates may violate 3604(c) (except in regard to sex—which they have conceded is okay)
      4. **Note**: court could have viewed this not about the identity and intimate association of the roommate, but about the human right of the one being excluded, right to have a place to live
4. **Notes**:
   1. Drug and alcohol treatment facility—unclear if considered a **dwelling**, court considered whether it was “intended for occupancy a residence:” consider if it designed to allow for occupants to stay there for an extended period of time & would those occupants view it as a “place to return to.” **Holding**: it’s a dwelling even though most stays only 2 weeks, b/c designed for longer stays and tenants treat it as home
   2. A **newspaper** that prints a discriminatory advertisement from a third party is potentially liable under 3604(c), but generally websites and **internet** providers will not be considered publishers of the material under the CDA and therefore not liable (Craigslist wasn’t responsible for postings on their site). But, if the site is responsible in whole or in part for its development, then on the hook—that is why Roomates.com wasn’t included in the exemption, they provided the questionnaire.
5. ***Asbury v. Brougham*** (10th Cir. 1989) **(Intentional Discrimination/Disparate Treatment)**
   1. **Facts:** Asbury (black) tries to get apartment or townhouse for herself and child but is told that none are available. Asbury’s sister-in-law, who is white inquired about availability and is told apartments available immediately, offered to hold. Data sheets show townhouses available.
   2. **Holding:** FHA §3604(d) & §1982 of CRA of 1866 violated. P proved her a prima facie case of intent to discriminate based on race & D unable to show legitimate, nondiscriminatory, non-pretextual reason
   3. **3 Part Test (Burden Shifting) (from McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green (1973)):**
      1. Plaintiff must prove a ***prima facie case*** of racial discrimination under §1982: (1) A member of a racial minority; (2) Applied for and was qualified to rent/purchase property; (3) Was denied the opportunity to rent/purchase or to inspect or negotiate for the rental/purchase; & (4) The housing opportunity remained available.
      2. **Burden Shift:** Defendant must produce evidence showing refusal to rent or negotiate for a rental was motivated by **legitimate, non-racial considerations**
      3. **Burden Shift:** Plaintiff must show that the proffered reasons were **pretextual**
   4. Asbury clearly satisfied prima facie case. Defendant claimed housing was unavailable. Defendants claim they just had a policy that families with one child could rent townhouses but not apartments, and that they made no exceptions. But jury found exceptions made in the past, and Asbury not told about townhouse exception. Sufficient for jury to find reason proffered was pretextual.
   5. **Notes**:
      1. Though court stated must prove desperate treatment under FHA, Supreme court (see Texas Department above) confirmed that only must showed **desperate impact**
      2. If clear evidence of desperate treatment— such as statement expressing racial animus—don’t even need the burden shifting approach; **burden shifting used if desperate treatment cases w/o direct evidence or for disparate impact cases**.
         * In disparate impact cases, the third prong will be different—not question of pretext, but question whether could be achieved in less discriminatory way (see FHA stuff above)
      3. Employers vicariously liable for acts of their employees—LL’s and real estate brokers may be liable for their agents (but officers of corporations are generally not personally liable unless they directed or approved the discriminatory practices)
6. **Remedies**:
   1. See §3613 under FHA: compensatory & punitive damages and injunctive relief
   2. Can also file complaint with HUD instead, which has power to investigate & mediate the dispute and adjudicate the complaint. They can issue a charge, at that point will go to federal court if either party chooses; otherwise, HUD will deal with it- can give injunctive relief & order damages ranging 10k-50k
   3. **Civil Rights Act of 1866** also applies to housing under §1982, but only applies to race, and only offers **damages** (no injunctive relief)
7. **Standing:**
   1. Certainly, those discriminated against due to their attributes or the attributes of those they associate with
   2. Those that feel that they were denied the right to “important social, professional, business and economic, political, and aesthetic benefits of interracial associations that arise from living in interracial communities
   3. **Testers**: w/o intent to purchase a residence pose as such to collect evidence of unlawful practices
   4. **Organizations that are dedicated to providing equal access**: if they can demonstrate that the steering practice caused them to devote extra resources to identify available housing and counteract the defendants steering practices

### Specific examples (some under state laws)

1. **Human Rights Commission v. LaBrie Inc:** familial status
   1. LL excluded minor children from the trailer park before the law change and then after changed it to a “two people maximum.” Although it appears neutral on its face, the status quo of the park hasn’t changed since, as no children occupy the park. Sufficient to show that the **purpose of the two-person limit was to eliminate or limit persons with minor children from the trailer park.**
      1. No direct evidence is necessary to prove a disparate treatment discrimination claim, but here the court says this was in fact direct evidence.
      2. Didn’t get to disparate impact, because found disparate treatment
   2. Brought claim under state law & not under FHA through “familial status”—why? Likely just because the state law was more specific & on point
   3. Note: **FHA** **does not cover marital status**, but a number of **state laws** explicitly prohibit discrimination on bases of marital status. Courts have found it applies to both married and unmarried couples; but unclear if violation if one doesn’t rent to unmarried couples due to his religious beliefs
2. **Quigley v. Winter:** sexual harassment
   1. **Rule:** hostile housing environment claim if a reasonable jury can find a plaintiff proved by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant subjected her to unwelcome sexual harassment, and the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to interfere with or deprive the plaintiff of her right to use or enjoy her home. Applied to the housing context, a claim of hostile housing environment caused by sexual harassment is actionable when the offensive behavior unreasonably interferes with use and enjoyment of the premises. The harassment must be sufficiently **severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the housing arrangement**.
   2. **Holding:** tenant was entitled to damages. It held that the tenant presented sufficient evidence of numerous unwanted interactions of a sexual nature that interfered with her use and enjoyment of her home.
      1. **Occurrences**: unwanted touching on two occasions, made sexually suggestive comments rubbed his genitals in front of her, placed several middle of the night phone calls to her home, made repeated unannounced visits, and on one occasion while he lay on her couch, had to be told to leave her home at least three times before he complied.
      2. There was more than sufficient evidence of coercion, intimidation, and interference with the tenant's enjoyment of her housing rights. The district court properly performed its gatekeeping function and did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence of three former tenants who also claimed they were sexually harassed by the landlord
   3. As seen here, courts have found that **sexual harassment is a form of “sex discrimination**” per the FHA (even when both men and women treated similarly—still being targeted b/c of their sex)
      1. They have also found that evicting women from their apartments for acts of **domestic violence** against them on the grounds that it violated the lease as unlawful and noisy in a manner offensive to other occupants is **sex discrimination**
         * Violence against women act explicitly provides some protections from eviction to victims of domestic violence
      2. Discriminating on the basis of **sexual orientation** has been interpreted **not** be included. Though, some **states have explicit provisions** that ban discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation
         * Just recently: 7th circuit court interpreted it to include sexual orientation
         * HUD has prohibited eligibility determinations for a variety of HUD-assisted housing on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status
      3. Discriminating against criminals: Under disparate impact theory, may violate 3604(a), which covers race, because disproportionate number of people with criminal convictions are racial minorities.
   4. **How severe must it be**? 7th circuit found that in employment contexts, a “hostile environment” required that the employer’s actions be sufficiently **severe or pervasive** to alter the conditions of the victim’s employment; and that applied to the housing context—one incident where the LL stroked a woman’s arm & said she could pay rent in other ways while calling her a bitch when she declined was not enough
      1. Some have argued that the standard should be lower in the housing context, looking at the importance of **one’s home as a safe place**
3. **State v. City of Madison:** sexual orientation (**State protections)**
   1. City provision doesn’t allow for discrimination based on sexual orientation and the court found that here, where the housemates (roommates) withdrew their acceptance of an applicant purely because of her sexual orientation, there was discrimination. (they were looking to sublet a room in the house they were leasing, so they could split their rent amongst another)
      1. The court said that the constitutional protections of the right to associate were not relevant because they were offering the housing for profit and therefore did not get those protections.
      2. Apparently, the court determined that the ordinance **applies to roommates** and it would not be a constitutional violation—contra to Roommate.com (not interpreting FHA though)
         * Viewed as **market transaction**, instead of focusing on the individual & its home
         * **Notice tension**—by treating at market transaction, would also weigh against more robust protections for women in their homes from sexual assault or more robust familial protections, because now just viewing it as market & not safe haven that is one’s home
4. **DiLiddo v. Oxford Street Realty:** income
   1. **Issue.** Whether the one-month termination provision of an AHVP lease is a requirement to accept an AHVP tenant and if so may a landlord reject that provision for purported financial reasons.
   2. **Holding**: No. Not only is a landlord forbidden to refuse to rent to a person who receives a subsidy for housing, but it is also unlawful to refuse to rent to that person based on the requirements held in the standard lease of a subsidy program member.  It is also unlawful to accept the lease but not to comply with the termination clause of the lease. That clause is a requirement of the lease and must be enforced. Defendant claims that this requirement does not protect his property interest. This court finds the proper balance between the land-lords rights and the right to affordable housing is met; therefore, the landlord refusal to agree to termination provision is a violation of the lease as establish under the AHVP.
   3. While FHA doesn’t include “source of income” as a protected category, a number of states include it in their statutes

**Discriminatory lending:**

1. **Background**: after great depression Congress decided to get involved & make home loans more accessible by creating banks & the Federal Housing Authority created to insure mortgages. HOLC also created—which assessed risk of different types of loans by mapping the country. Home Mortgage Disclosure Act also passed.
2. **Redlining:** practice of not providing loans in minority neighborhoods (often based on HOLC maps).
   1. More recently, problem became not the outright denial, but the provision of loans that were disadvantageous to minority borrowers. **Reverse redlining**- makes unfair loans w/ bad terms more available to minority groups that often can’t afford to pay them
      1. In response: new standards in place that help ensure borrower has ability to repay to stop the abusive practices of getting minorities to take out unsustainable loans
      2. But: it has become harder now for minorities to get the housing loans (**hard balance**)
3. **M&T Mortgage Corp. V Foy:** rebuttable presumption that if have **minority buyer** buying in a **minority area** that a 9.5% mortgage interest loan is discriminatory (Major Foy a minority due to military service)
   1. Appears that there is reverse redlining here, creating the presumption the extended in discriminatory manner
      1. **HMDA:** the reports on predatory loaning show that loans given in certain areas that exceed 9% will be considered discriminatory or a high-priced loan and require further investigation
         * HMDA provides data on loans granted and those not, which can reveal discriminatory patterns in lending practices.
         * Note: Important tool in combination with class action suits, as direct discrimination is rare. But *Walmart* made relying on statistical data to meet the commonality requirement of a class action difficult to do, because discretion is involved in individual cases.
      2. Note: we don’t generally think of courts as doing “investigations.” Court is serving in role of equity and viewed themselves in a supervisory role creating this presumption
         * “Equity abhors discrimination” (**Mount Laurel**)
         * “Equity will not enforce discriminatory practices” (won’t give their stamp of approval, think similar to **Shelley and Evans)**
   2. In order to foreclosure upon a mortgage that is presumably discriminatory the burden is now on the mortgagee to show by a fair preponderance of that evidence that the mortgage is not a product of unlawful discrimination. The mortgage interest rate must be based on economic reasons only.
4. **Adkins v. Morgan Stanley:**
   1. Under **FHA** (3605): explicitly bars any person or other entity from discrimination whose business includes engaging in residential real estate-related transactions, which includes the making or purchasing of loans or providing other financial assistance secured by residential real estate.
      1. Note, fair lending is also and primarily regulated through the **Equal Credit Opportunity act**, which bars discrimination in all credit transactions on basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age.
      2. Also protected by state statues and traditional tools of equity (as seen in Foy)
   2. Showed enough of a **Prima Facia case** (in the 3-part burden shifting regime) to overcome summary judgement: showed that there was in fact a **policy** here and that policy has a significant adverse or disproportionate **effect** on minorities—to prove this, they relied on some official data, but also newspapers and articles
      1. Currently in courts and question is causation: need a direct correlation between the injury and the injurious conduct alleged. Looking for direct relation.

# immunity from loss

* Security of having one’s own entitlements changed by others (a preference for maintaining the status quo)
* But, as we have seen, rights are not absolute, limited by states power to acquire
* Balance of protecting people’s reliance interest on their property & promoting development/ government action

## Regulating the State’s Power to acquire property rights

### Public use and just compensation

1. **Eminent Domain:** “Nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation”—applies to states and federal government (5th amendment)
   1. Inherent in sovereignty—doesn’t actually grant right, but acknowledges it and then limits it
   2. Efficiency: diminishes transaction costs that otherwise might grind private projects to a halt
2. **Kelo v. City of New London:** taking for economic development
   1. **Facts**: Economically depressed community: considered distressed municipality, but not blighted
      1. Integrated development plan: private residences and private commercial properties will be included—certainly not everything being built will be open to the public at large (will also have marina w/ riverwalk, some shopping and parking lots)
      2. Also note: not something like navy base, which is for the public—but necessarily must be closed off for their protection
   2. **Majority**:
      1. **Rule**: is the taking rationally related to a “**public purpose**.”
      2. Claims that two cases are clear precedent for this idea that economic development included in public use. (1) *Berman*: purpose of to redevelop a blighted area; (2) Hawaii: to sever property from a few owners who owned 50% of the land
      3. Petitioner claim: Economic development is just a pretext from transferring property from one person to another—blurring the boundaries of private and public and therefore should adopt a bright line rule saying that economic development doesn’t justify a taking
         * Response: often time things that will benefit the public, will benefit private parties as well. Economic development is one of the functions of government & regardless, there will be benefits besides for economic benefits
           + Government published trade secrets to help pesticide industry—clearly benefited other private parties at expense of those w/ the secrets, but was for public, so OK
           + Hawaii- people got to lease property they wouldn’t have had otherwise
           + Berman: there was also a private development company there as well
      4. Petitioner claim: should be reasonably certain that the public benefits will accrue
         * Response: would be grind everything to a halt, can’t prove each parcel will be useful until all the property is acquired, and the final plan can be put in place
      5. Some amount of focus that serious development plan made here—lot of process
   3. **Kennedy**:
      1. Fears that this could be used as a pretext to show favoritism, but the facts here don’t suggest a more demanding standard should be applied
      2. **Reasons fine here**: (1) depressed economic condition; (2) didn’t know who the beneficiaries were going to be; (3) city reviewed a number of development plans; and (4) other beneficiaries are still unknown
   4. **Dissent**: economic developments cannot justify a taking; **takings** (for economic development-I think) **need to be correcting a harm or injurious condition**. Public use is to prevent social or public harm
      1. Narrower view of the precedent—those were to avoid affirmative public harms
      2. Reason to take more narrow approach to police power in context of takings?
      3. But is there a practical way of distinguishing preventing harm and improving conditions?
   5. **Thomas** **Dissent**: “**public use**” means that the government **will own the property, or the public will have a right to use the property**
3. **State constitutions**: most have interpreted in line with supreme court, but recently some courts have taken a narrower approach to protect property rights more robustly (interpreting state constitution)
   1. Some (in line with Kennedy): “the public benefits and characteristics of the intended use **substantially predominate** over the private nature of that use”
   2. Some (in line with O’Conner): property cannot be taken and transferred form one owner to another unless the **nature of the property itself** justifies the taking. Prohibit taking for economic development unless the property being taken is causing harm to others.
   3. Some: must be justified in that the same purpose **could not be achieved in any other way** than through a taking of one owner’s property and transfer to another
   4. Michigan supreme court (combined several rationales): transferring property from one private owner to another satisfies the public use test only when (1) **public necessity** of the extreme sort requires collective action; (2) the property will be subject to **public oversight** after transfer to a private entity; and (3) the property is selected because of facts of **independent public significance** about the property being taken, rather than advantage to the private entity to whom the property is transferred (like a blighted area that will not be redeveloped without pubic action of some sort)
   5. Some courts (in line with Thomas): public “use” means **public ownership or use by the public**. Can never take property from one private person and transfer it to another.
4. **Statutory constraints** on eminent domain for economic development:
   1. Congress enacted some limitations on using federal funds for projects that involve economic development eminent domain
   2. Many states have passed legislation and constitutional amendment limiting power to take property for economic developments
      1. Some ban transferring property from one owner to another for economic development purposes to support increased tax revenue or additional jobs
      2. Some stakes Thomas’s literal “use” approach
      3. Many ban taking unless the property being take is blighted, raising health and safety concerns
      4. Some regulate through procedures designed to increase public participation in the process
5. **Just Compensation:**
   1. Supreme court**: fair market value of the property prior to taking**. Measured by damage to owner, not value to government.
      1. Rejected asking price because too hard to determine
      2. *U.S v. Acres of Land, More or Less*: Fair market value does not include that special value of the property to the owners arising from its adaptability to his particular use—not unusual that the market value received for property in taking, won’t enable owner to continue its use
      3. This is difficult when a home is taken. But justified that needed for benefit of public and that is reflects the vulnerability that is inherent in the obligations one has to a democracy
      4. A few states: require payment of 125%-150%
         * Causes some **holdup concerns**—owners that would really be willing to sell, won’t sell for market value, because they know they will get more if government forced to take from them
   2. Supreme court has held that **don’t have a right for moving costs**, only for the property value
      1. **Also refused to grant compensation for goodwill or “going-concern value**” (benefit of already operating business v. starting a new one with just the basic materials)—any barrier to relocation is merely incidental to the taking
      2. **Exception**: if the taking is temporary the owner is entitled to compensation for loss of goodwill, because cannot relocate elsewhere in the interim
      3. Statutes: federal government has passed legislation requiring compensation for moving costs, lost personal property occasioned by the move and actual reasonable expenses in searching for a replacement business if property is taken by the federal government or state governments using federal funding
         * Some states have allowed for compensation of goodwill when a business has close ties to a particular location and relocation would not avoid the loss
           + Some *state courts* allow for business losses in narrow instances if the business is not easily movable because of the unique character of the property
   3. Partial takings:
      1. **Severance damages**: if take 40/100 acres of land (must compensate not just for the 40 acres) but for the reduction in value to the remaining 60 acres caused by taking 40
         * But, if there are **special benefits**—created when the taking results in an increase in the value of the particular remaining property that is not shared by the public at large (i.e. by benefiting a specific business by being particularly close to the new foot traffic), that will be offset against the severance damages. Some allow for an offset even for **general benefits** (NJ—any benefit to the owner, if reasonably quantifiable, will be measured against losses in market value to the remaining property caused by the partial taking)
         * But, courts are split if the special benefits can reduce the amount it owners for the actual property taken (and not just for the severance damages). Most courts do not allow an offset in that situation.

### “Regulatory” takings and the ad hoc test

1. A regulation of property will be deemed a taking if “fairness and justice” require a court to conclude that the **public at large, rather than a single owner**, must bear the burden of an exercise of state power in the public interest.” Regulations are not takings if they are “properly treated as part of the burden of common citizenship”—if burden on all, then not a taking
   1. Is it fair or just for the single owner to bear the burden? **How much should they have to bear for the good of the community?** (freedom of action v. freedom of security—others have right to be protected from the owner’s exercise of their property rights through regulation, but to what extent?)
   2. “If regulation goes too far, it will be recognized as a taking”—Holmes (Penn Coal v. Mahon)
2. Penn Central test: requires courts to engage in essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries of the particular circumstances of each case, with a focus on: (1) the economic impact of the regulation on the particular owner; (2) the protection of reasonable or distinct investment-backed expectations; and (3) the character of the governmental action
   1. In 2005 Supreme Court made clear that the court aims to identify regulatory actions that are “**functionally equivalent to the classic taking** in which the government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his domain.”
      1. It is not a means-end test of the regulation, not looking to see if substantially advances a legitimate interest (it is not a due process claim, it is harder to overcome)
      2. Though sometimes unclear if a due process or taking claim is appropriate
   2. Most regulations will be upheld under this test as a legitimate use of the police power
      1. **Types that have a higher chance**: (a) deprivation of certain core property rights or estates in land—such as right to pass fee simple at death; (b) retroactive deprivation of vested rights belonging to owners who invested in reasonable reliance on prior regulatory authorization; (c) plurality has suggested that judicial decisions that eliminate property rights, might give rise to taking liability
      2. Also, exactions—conditions on land use development permits—can be unconstitutional if they don’t substantially advance the same interests that authorities asserted would allow them to deny the permit altogether (*Koontz)*
   3. There are two categories that are considered **per se takings** (but even these are applied very narrowly)
      1. Any **permanent physical invasion** of property constitutes a taking *(Loretto)*
      2. A complete deprivation of **all economically viable use** of property interest constitutes a taking, unless background principles of nuisance and property law independently restrict the owner’s intended use of the property—never had the right in the first place (*Lucas*)
3. ***Penn Central Test to Determine if there is a Regulatory Taking Requiring Compensation:***
   1. **The Economic impact of the regulation on the particular owner (diminution of value)**
      1. Diminution in value alone is not enough to demonstrate a taking (*Euclid*)
      2. The greater the diminution in value, the more likely will be a taking
         * Complete deprivation of any economically viable use is a taking (but see Lucas)
      3. What is the **denominator** against which the deprivation will be compared? The extent of the diminution of value depends on how the courts define the relevant property interest
         * **Penn. Coal v. Mahon** (see above): majority view the interest as “air rights”—which were entirely taken away; Brandies dissent viewed the interest more broadly—as the right to build on one’s land
         * Penn Central: “Parcel as a whole” rule—like Brandies dissent in Mahon.
           + But can be unclear what constitutes the “parcel” in question
   2. **The protection of reasonable or distinct investment-backed expectations**
      1. Opportunity cost of forgone development **not** a frustration of an **investor-backed expectation**. More likely to satisfy this prong if it can be shown that an investment has already been made in reasonable reliance on existing statutory or regulatory regime (*Penn Central)*
      2. Balance of protecting people’s investment & reliance and the need for the legislature to change the law to impose greater restrictions with changing circumstances
   3. **The character of the governmental action.**
      1. *Penn Coal*: “Government could hardly go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such charge in the general law.”
         * Too narrow of a read would interfere with legislatures & give judges too much discretion
         * But protecting public welfare can’t be sufficient- will be able to destroy property rights at will & taking clause will be meaningless
      2. Adjusting the benefits/burdens of economic life justified if common good overall is promoted; courts deferential on government judgments as to what promotes welfare *(Penn Central)*
      3. Ask whether law legitimately is preventing an owner from harming others by imposing negative externalities on neighbors/community or is illegitimately requiring the owner to contribute a benefit to the community. Also ask, whether the law imposes a disparate impact on a few owners or constitutes a legitimate general regulatory law affecting a class of property that is appropriately subject to restrictions.
      4. Clear, owners have no vested rights to destroy the environment or pollute.
4. ***Penn Coal. V Mahon:***
   1. Extent of the diminution of value to the property: debate whether just focus on the coal under house, or the coal on the entire property
      1. Nectow: deprived all possible economic use & was therefore invalid
   2. Nature of the public interest served by legislation: debate whether view as just one house or general idea that state needs to be able to control nuisances
      1. Euclid analogizes the law of nuisance when dealing with regulatory zoning
5. ***Penn Central v. NY*** (1978) **(Ad Hoc Takings Test)**
   1. **Facts:** NYC passes landmark preservation law designating Grand Central a landmark. Owners want to build a 50-story office building above the station & enter into a long-term lease with occupant. As landmark, law imposes duty on owner to maintain exterior features of a building.
   2. **Issue:** Whether a city may…place restrictions on the development of individual historic landmarks…without effecting a taking requiring the payment of just compensation.
   3. **Test:**
      1. **Economic impact:** Diminution of value claim of plaintiffs is suspect. First, they may transfer their right to develop above the site under the TDR regime (transfer of development rights)
         * Also, taking jurisprudence does not divide the parcel into discrete segments to see if rights in one segment are deprived – **denominator issue.**
           + **Penn Coal:** had argued that there was a full diminution of value, because taking away the use of the air rights entirely
      2. **2) Investment-backed expectations:** *Distinction between impairing opportunity cost by depriving future development benefit from cases where investment is already made in substantial reliance on existing statutory or regulatory regime*. Here, no investment made yet (no expectation). **Present use** **also not interfered with – like *Euclid*.** Commission also hasn’t destroyed all rights to develop above the terminal – just 50 stories.
      3. **3) Character of government action:** “A taking may more readily be found when the interference with property can be characterized as a physical invasion by government, than when interference arises from some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.”
   4. **Holding (Brennan): Not a taking.**
      1. Diminution of value alone is insufficient to establish a taking (*Euclid*). See above re: denominator. Also, may still develop smaller building, and TDRs still have value.
      2. Primary expectation not frustrated – present use of Terminal not impacted.
      3. That the Law has a more severe impact on some landowners than others does not itself mean the law effects a taking.
         * No discriminatory zoning, part of a comprehensive plan that applies to all historical sites. And there is some reciprocity of advantage by being part of this broader plan. (While more specific than Mahon—a state law applying to all land—still not targeting them)
      4. Won’t second-guess judgment of NYC that landmark preservation confers a benefit on all NYC citizens.
   5. **Dissent (Rehnquist):** Disagrees with benefits/burdens analysis – whether burden should be imposed entirely on the owners of individual properties is the question. No “average reciprocity of advantage.” No nuisance concern. Everyone here is benefiting, while only one party being burdened
6. **Theories** that justify the exercise of identifying regulatory **taking as distinct** from exercises of police power that do not require compensation (unlike takings- which do)
   1. **Tradition**: looks to traditional definitions of property interests to determine which government actions other than outright transfer of property to the government have constituted takings of property that had to be compensated
      1. But what is traditional? CL or legislative alterations? What time period? What jurisdiction? Should changes over time be recognized as evolution of the tradition or a departure form it?
      2. Even if rule is clear—what is its scope? Should we focus on the rules or the principles that drove them?
      3. CL definition of property has been shaped by judges, is their view more legitimate than the current legislature who are responding to public needs and contemporary social values?
   2. **Efficiency**:
      1. Michelman: Compensation should be required when it will help to promote efficient legislation. Consider 3 costs from public projects: (1) the harms to uncompensated individuals caused by the project; (2) the settlement or administrative costs of arranging to compensate them; (3) the “demoralization ” costs that would accrue if the victims were not compensated and people believed that this lack of compensation was unfair. He argues that compensation should be awarded when the demoralization costs are greater than the costs to settle
      2. The efficiency argument that would justify requiring compensation when regulatory laws impinge on property rights rest on the idea that legislation is welfare maximizing when its benefits outweigh the costs & by having those that benefit compensate those that lose, its ensures that legislation isn’t being passed due to special interest groups even when harm > good
         * This can serve to avoid corruption and align the government more closely with the general public good
         * Counter: administrative costs of compensating everyone are high, may stop efficient legislation from being passed (when people irrationally underestimate the risk of current conduct—pollution), creates moral hazards—people won’t consider the effect their conduct will have on others or that might be subject to regulation (it provides insurance for adverse changes in land use regulation, causing developers to over-invest in socially harmful activities)
      3. **Distributive justice**: should an individual owner fairly and justly need to bear this harm for benefit of society?
         * Taxpayers as a group should bear the costs for programs that benefit the community. When owners suffer a unique damage, there is no reciprocity.
         * Counter: there is reciprocity—because they also benefit from their neighbors being regulated as well, moreover- this activity was producing negative externalities, which they did not have right to do

### per se takings

1. ***Prune Yard Shopping Center v. Robbins*** (1980) **(Restricting Right to Exclude Not a Taking)**
   1. **Facts:** While *Lloyd Corp* barred free speech claims in malls, California court held there is a right to distribute literature in malls protected by state constitution. Students sought to solicit support for their opposition to a UN resolution against Zionism. Mall excludes them. Cal. Ct. upholds their right to protest, but mall claims their requirement to allow the protesters in violates their 5th (taking)/14th (right against deprivation of property w/o due process) Amendment rights.
   2. **Holding (Rehnquist):** Deprivation of right to exclude is not a taking under the US constitution.
      1. Granted, one of the essential “sticks” in the bundle of property rights is the right to exclude. And here, there was a literal taking of this right. But not every destruction or injury to property is a taking.
      2. Right to exclude arbitrarily exists, even where a business is open to the public. But statutes may take basis for exclusion off the table – this does not constitute a taking
   3. **Application of Ad hoc Takings Test:**
      1. Economic impact – no diminution of value shown. Mall is free to restrict time, place, and manner. *That the intrusion is only temporary, not permanent, is an important distinction constitutionally (see Loretto)*
      2. Investment backed expectations – nothing here. General use not impeded. Won’t change profitability of mall.
   4. “*Nor as a general proposition is the US, as opposed to the several states, possessed of residual authority that enables it to define “property” in the first instance.”*
      1. **Concurrence (Marshall):** does not believe the court is suggesting that the rights of property are to be defined solely by state law, or that there is no federal constitutional barrier to the abrogation of common-law rights by Congress or a state government.
         * “Life. Liberty. Property” have a normative dimension, establishing a “sphere of private autonomy which government is bound to respect.”
   5. Lurking issue – if government defines property, and also adjudicates what constitutes an impermissible taking of property without compensation, is there any limit to government police power?
2. ***Loretto v. Teleprompter*** (1982) **(Physical Invasion Per Se Taking)**
   1. **Facts:** NY law requires landlord to allow cable TV company to install its cable through property. P discovers cable after purchasing building, alleging it was a trespass & a taking without just compensation.
   2. **Rule**: If physical occupation, no matter how marginal, is permanent, the occupation constitutes an invasion of property prohibited by the 5th Amendment’s takings clause without compensation.
   3. **Holding (Marshall):** Physical occupation authorized by government is a taking without regard to the public interests that it many serve. *Narrow – affirm traditional rule that a permanent physical occupation is a taking; do not question authority of state to restrict owner’s use of property.*
      1. Invasion here distinguishable from *Prune Yard* because it is a *permanent* invasion.
      2. Government doesn’t just take a single strand (carveout) from the bundle = it chops through the bundle, taking a slice of every strand.
      3. Constitutional protection for the rights of private property cannot be made to depend on the size of the area permanently occupied. Also, shouldn’t depend on type of physical occupation.
      4. Won’t impact power to adjust landlord/tenant relationships.
   4. **Dissent (Blackmun):** What is permanent? Why is this the line? Temporary invasions can far more intrude into owner’s enjoyment of property than permanent one. And what about statutory authority to require landlords to install physical facilities like utility connections, mailboxes, smoke detectors, etc.?
3. **Note case:** *Yee v. City of Escondido*
   1. **Facts:** Allowed mobile home owner to continue renting even after lease term expired. **Holding:** Did not amount to a physical invasion of property and did not matter that mobile home owner could sell the home in place and transfer the tenancy to a new owner without consent of park owner. What mattered was the *invitation* to occupy the land. It was thus not an “unwanted physical occupation”. Not like *Loretto*, where landlord did not know cable was there/did not invite cable company in?
4. ***Less* likely to be taking if:** Already regulated issue, Physical invasion doesn’t interfere with profit, Temporary invasion, Characterized as health/safety/welfare measure, Invited in or contracted with previously
5. ***Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal*** (1992) **(Per Se Taking for 100% Value Loss, *unless* Background Principle in Nuisance Law Invoked by State)**
   1. **Facts:** 1977 South Carolina Coastal Management Act enacted before Lucas purchases property. Then Beachfront Management Act passed in 1988, preventing any building/development on parcel, because of fear of further erosion – prior act merely required obtaining a permit to develop in a critical area.
      1. SC SCOTUS – no compensation owed regardless of impact on property value. Enough that law is meant to prevent serious public harm for it to be valid exercise of police power.
   2. **Holding (Scalia):** Because Lucas was deprived of *all* economically beneficial use, a taking occurred, and he is entitled to compensation.
      1. **Functionally equivalent to a taking**
   3. **Rule:** “When the owner of real property is called upon to sacrifice all economically beneficial uses in the name of the common good, that is, to leave his property economically idle, he has suffered a taking.”
      1. “Where the State seeks to sustain regulation that deprives land of all economically beneficial use, we think it may resist compensation *only if* the logically antecedent inquiry into the nature of the owner’s estate shows that the proscribed use interests were not part of his title to begin with.”
         * I.e. Would not have been allowed under state/common law anyway
         * In other words, if state/court would have already had the power to stop you from causing harm, regulation is OK
      2. Worried that relying on Miller rule of “noxious use” – where legislature need only articulate harm-preventing justification – is too fungible.
         * Fear that claiming any harm can be abused to use private property for the public
         * “SC needs to rely on background principles of nuisance or property law that prohibit the uses Lucas now intends in the circumstances in which the property is presently found.” Does the harm inhere in the property itself?
   4. **Dissent (Blackmun):** Missile to kill a mouse. Hasn’t lost all economic value – can still use it for beech access.
   5. **Dissent (Blackmun):** How does common law principle avoid the same trap as harm analysis of being too “fungible”?
   6. **Dissent (Stevens):** Why does per se rule make sense? Really case that if you lose 99% value, no per se rule but if you lose 100%, you get compensation?
      1. Will have effect of ***freezing property laws/definitions***. Legislature can no longer revise laws governing rights and uses of property.
6. ***Palazzolo v. Rhode Island*** (2001) **(Lucas in Action)**
7. **Facts:** Developer denied permits to develop waterfront property by state agency charged with enforcing laws regulating construction on the coast. P sued RI seeking compensation under *Lucas* claiming he was denied all economically viable use. RI SCOTUS denied compensation.
8. **Issues:** 1) some value left; 2) law was already in place when P applied – no investor-backed expectations.
9. **Holding (Kennedy):**Reserves judgment on first. Reverses on second finding.
10. Re: investor-backed expectation – fact that the owner took title with notice of the regulation did not, by itself, immunize the state from facing a challenge to regulation as a taking of property. *Temporality is just one factor.*
11. Not a 100% taking, but *Penn* ad hoc test applies.
12. Argument between Scalia and O’Connor whether per se rules should be resisted – O’Connor says yes, Scalia says per se rule should just include that whether a restriction existed at time purchaser takes title should have no bearing upon the determination of whether a taking occurred, unless the restriction forms part of the background principles of the state’s law of property and nuisance (*Lucas*)
13. On remand, RI trial court found development would constitute a public nuisance – *Lucas*: not a taking because background principle in common law would hold activity unlawful.
14. Ongoing question – can background principles evolve? Do state statutes compose background principles?
15. ***Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency*** (2002) **(Temporary Moratorium – Ad hoc Taking Test. Not Per Se)**
16. **Facts:** Regional planning agency placed a temporary moratorium on construction around Lake Tahoe. Injunction extends ban for 6 years – intended to allow the agency time to develop a plan to limit construction to prevent loss of Tahoe’s exceptional clarity.
17. **Holding (Stevens):** Temporary building moratorium was not a *per se* taking of property. Would rather rely on *ad hoc* formula, and find it isn’t a taking. Cites O’Connor concurrence, notes resistance to use per se rules in cases involving partial regulatory takings.
18. Anything less than 100% diminution of value still requires multifactor *Penn* test.
19. For diminution – *whole property* must be considered (more like Brandeis?)
20. Owner cannot isolate a slice of time over which it had the right to build as a distinctive (temporal) piece of property. The parcel as a whole rule prohibits this kind of conceptual severance.
21. **Tension** – don’t want to ossify property law by depriving states/courts of the ability to redefine property interests with time. But we also don’t want unlimited ability to redefine at the risk of eliminating or invalidating expectation interests in property altogether.
    1. Every theory of taking seems to be a positivist decision—think Bentham (property needs the law), Holmes (news is valuable b/c we give it the interest), Marshall in M’intosh (property is what the sovereign says it is)
    2. Concerns: we determine what constitutes a regulatory taking based on how much value is lost under state law (what person expected). But see Rehnquist in prune yard—states have the right to define what property is (not U.S). If that is true they can always redefine it & say for example that an expectation interest does not exist—property had no value besides how state defines it
       1. Do courts and the government have unlimited power to define what property is?
    3. Marshall concurrence in ***Prune Yard***: Property not just positive law created by state. There is a **normative dimension** – a sphere of private autonomy government is bound to protect. Natural law?

### Exactions

1. **Exaction**: a condition for development is imposed on a parcel of land that requires the developer to mitigate anticipated negative impacts of development
2. **Nolan & Dolan cases:** (two constitutional requirements for any exaction)
   1. **Essential nexus**: Is there a connection between what the government is trying to accomplish and the form that the exaction actually takes?
      1. Was not met in *Nolan*—giving a public easement for a right of way to reach the beach had nothing to do with adding floors to his house. No nexus between pathway for public on property (as they already had access to the beach) & blocking view from street with added floors
      2. Met in *Dolan*—bike pathway related to help traffic congestion that would increase due to Dolan expanding his store
   2. **Rough Proportionality**: look to see if the burden of the condition is reasonably proportional to the burden or impact of the development itself (*Dolan)*
      1. But rough proportionality is difficult to apply- often relies on studies
3. **Koontz:** was either going to need to give up more land (than he offered) or pay to improve other wetland to get permit for his development of his wetland
   1. **Does the N-D test apply to the denial of permits?**
      1. Yes—there is no substantive or practical difference between granting approval w/ a condition (condition subsequent) & denying approval unless x (condition precedent)
      2. But what can be the remedy? B/c practically no conditions & therefore no taking— **unconstitutional conditions doctrine:** constitutional injury on impermissible burden on the right to just compensation
   2. **Does it matter if it is a physical or monetary exaction?**
      1. **Majority**: fear that authorities could evade N-D and simply changing their physical test into a monetary test
         * Here, there is a link between the property & the monetary condition
      2. **Dissent:** money is fungible, not tied to a piece of property & therefore a requirement that a person pay money to repair wetlands is not a taking (Doesn’t affect a specific identified property or property act)
         * (And since out of N-D, out of heightened scrutiny and bring in the Penn Central test or Euclid area—deference to legislature (she said this-doesn’t seem correct, just not taking)
         * ***Apfel:*** taking clause only applies to takings of specific property interests, such as interests in real property or interests in a particular identifiable fund of money; it does not apply to general obligations to pay money from whatever fund one possesses
           + Majority here felt that demand for money was related to “petitioners’ ownership of a specific parcel of land.” Dissent disagreed
      3. **Note:** all agree that if there is no condition ever proposed in first place, outright rejected permit, then there would not have been a taking- granting the benefit was entirely discretionary- only became an issue once condition was made
         * Could limit useful negotiations between the city & developers—as they won’t offer to grant a permit on condition out of fear will be declared a taking under the more searching review of the N-D test
   3. **Tension:** how much should the court be policing what is considered taking of property—who should decide?
4. **Note:** Koontz settled question that N-D applies to monetary exactions (impact fees), but those cases were in context of individualized decisions. Didn’t settle question whether it would apply to general legislation requiring pre-set conditions for all developers & parcels of land in a given area —less fear of abuse and might create a reciprocity of advantage like general zoning laws. Some courts have found it sufficient for a government to make a general determination that particular types of development have particular impacts and impose fees reasonably related to them, while others have held that N-D requires individualized assessment of each parcel
   1. In short: unclear if applies just to administrative decisions, or even to legislative ones

# Clarifying notes

1. Defining features:
   1. Bundle of entitlements created by and enforced by the state
      1. Right to exclude v. reasonable right of access (Uston, state law, constitutional law)
      2. Privilege to use v. duty not to harm others (nuisance, zoning, servitudes)
      3. Power to transfer v. regulating doctrines (estates, common ownership, leaseholds, FHA)
      4. Immunity from loss v. government need to promote society needs
2. Areas of confusion:
   1. Scope of right to exclude- desperate impact/treatment:
      1. Treatment: intentional treatment of like people differently with result of denying access to housing or public accommodations (no animus needed)
         1. Available for all
         2. **FHA- Asbury case- burden shifting**
      2. Impact: facially natural law has an exclusionary effect on people of a protected group
         1. Not available under the 14th amendment
         2. Almost certainly not available under 1981 under civil right act
         3. Maybe available for title II- different approaches
         4. **Definitely allowed under the ADA**
         5. **Definitely allowed under the FHA: Texas HUD** & agency rules give desperate impact claim- burden shifting also. Note different than treatment analysis. (1) need robust causality requirement; (2) needs to be necessary to further a substantial interest; (3) less discriminatory ways available (all slightly different than Asbury test, third factor big change)
   2. **Covenants analysis:**
      1. **Rules for interpreting an ambiguous conveyance** (grantors intent- Edwards; presumption against forfeiture- relates if should be covenant or estate issue)
      2. **Traditional tests for covenants**: real covenants and equitable servitudes- traditionally depended on what remedy one was seeking, today that is no longer the case
         1. **Restatements approach**
      3. **Specific jurisdictional approaches to covenants**:
         1. Reasonableness review of prohibited acts (Davidson, narhstdat, neuman)
         2. Standards of review on restraints on alienation
         3. Review of racially restrictive covenants- state action
      4. **Implied reciprocal negative servitudes doctrine**
   3. Zoning and taking:
      1. Can challenge the action by the state:
         1. **Substantive due process claim**:
            * Euclid deference for a zoning ordinance- likely going to fail
            * Strict scrutiny for fundamental rights
         2. **Equal protection claims**
            * Also has heightened scrutiny
         3. **Takings clause**
            * Are we in eminent domain- public use
            * Regulatory-Penn Central
            * Are we in bright line categorical rule
            * Local exactions- money condition to develop
