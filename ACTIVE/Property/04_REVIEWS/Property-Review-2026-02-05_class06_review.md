# Review — Class #6 — 2026-02-05 — What Should Be Property? (Moore) & Right to Exclude (Jacque)

---

## 0. RECAP: Adverse Possession (Classes 3-5)

### What Adverse Possession Is

**Definition**: A form of sequential possession (in context of real property). If someone trespasses on land long enough in the right way, they can become the owner—even against the original owner's wishes. Their right becomes "good against all the world."

**Contrast to tort law**: Normally, trespass = tort. But adverse possession says: after a statutory period, trespass can confer ownership.

**Traditional elements** (must be ALL met):

1. **Actual**: Physically occupying the land. Example: occupying 2 acres of a 50-acre parcel = actual possession of those 2 acres, not the whole thing.

2. **Exclusive**: Adverse possessor must possess "to the exclusion of everyone else's claims" and act "in ways that unequivocally indicated exercising dominion of a sole owner." BUT: owner can voluntarily let others use; that's consistent with exclusive possession.
   - Case: *Scott v. Anderson Tully* (timber-cutting on someone else's land).

3. **Open and Notorious**: 
   - **Open**: How visible was the possession? "Good people see it if you're looking at it."
   - **Notorious**: Was the community aware? Did the neighbors know what was going on?
   - Case: *Scott v. Anderson Tully*.

4. **Continuous**: Must be ordinary use for that type of property.
   - Example: Summer home = seasonal occupation sufficient (don't need year-round occupancy).
   - **Tacking**: Can add predecessor's time if there's sufficient privity (just a legally relevant relationship; low bar).
   - Case: *Howard v. Kunta*.

5. **Adverse or Hostile, Under Claim of Right**: Possession must be contrary to the true owner's rights = you didn't have permission.
   - **Objective, not subjective**: Hostility means "contrary to their legal rights," not animosity or ill will in the actor's mind.
   - **Competing conceptions of "claim of right"**: Some states require good faith; some don't care; some (Maine, maybe) required bad faith (outlier).
   - Case: *Carpenter v. Ruperto* (requires good faith; outlier).

6. **Statutorily required time**: Varies by state. NY = 10 years. Minimum in US = 5 years. May be extended by tolling for disabilities (minority, insanity, etc.).

### Why Adverse Possession Exists? (Policy Justifications)

1. **Psychology**: People grow attached to property after being there a long time. Wresting it away is harsh.

2. **Active use over idle ownership**: Property law favors productive use. If true owner leaves land vacant/junk-filled, but adverse possessor improves it, maybe adverse possessor should win.
   - Example: *Carpenter v. Ruperto*—woman grades lot, plants grass, installs propane tank. Makes productive use.

3. **Decreasing information costs**: If property has been occupied for (e.g., 10 years), you can rely on that. Don't want to worry about old deeds in great aunt's attic popping up 110 years later. Statute of limitations = certainty.

### Key Controversies

**Good faith vs. bad faith**: Traditional justifications say nothing about whether AP was done in good faith or bad faith. Both are rewarded.
- Makes sense theoretically but feels weird normatively to many people.
- Some states (NY) have changed law to require good faith.

**Professor's point**: Standard justifications may be incomplete. They may be missing important normative considerations.

## 1. Main Points (organized by question)

### A. MAIN POINT 1: What kinds of things SHOULD be ownable as property?

**Context**: Professor framed this class as a **shift in focus**. We've spent Classes 1-5 on "how do you acquire ownership?" (first possession, adverse possession). Now: "what KINDS of things should the law treat as property at all?"

**The test case**: Body parts. You're born with them (ultimate "first possession"), but should they be property? Can you sell your spleen?

**Moore v. Regents answer: NO. Spleen cells are NOT property.**

**Two-part analysis:**

1. **Does existing conversion law cover this?** 
   - **No possession**: Moore had no expectation of retaining the spleen after surgery. Conversion requires interference with possession or ownership.
   - **No ownership**: California biomedical waste statutes eliminate so many rights from the "bundle" that what's left isn't property. (At some point you remove enough sticks and it's no longer a bundle.)

2. **Should conversion law be extended to cover body parts?**
   - **No.** Court does social balancing: scientific research interest > Moore's individual interest (even considering commodification/dignity concerns).
   - **Why no extension?** Three reasons: (1) Informed consent rules adequately protect patients; (2) Property rights would impede research (assembly costs problem); (3) Institutional competence—legislature, not courts, should decide this fraught policy question.

**The commodification concern (Mosk's dissent)**: Allowing Moore to own and sell his spleen = making humans tradeable = "akin to slavery." Court avoids this by refusing to extend property law to body parts. Instead: regulate through specialized statutes, informed consent, fiduciary duty—but NOT property rights.

**Doctrinal takeaway: Bundle of rights framework matters.** Some things (land, chattels) = property → full bundle of sticks. Some things (body parts) = NOT property → their own category ("sui generis"), regulated by alternative doctrines. #EXAM_SIGNAL

---

### B. MAIN POINT 2: What rights does property ownership actually give you?

**The answer (from Jacque)**: The **right to exclude** is central and absolutely protected—even when exercised unreasonably, even when no actual damage occurs.

**Jacque v. Steenberg Homes**:
- Steenberg trespasses across 170-acre property to deliver mobile home (no actual damage; probably never touched dirt under 7 ft of snow).
- Jacques' stated reason for refusing: afraid of adverse possession (risk was actually zero—permission defeats hostility).
- Award: $1 nominal damages + $100,000 punitive damages.

**The holding**: Intentional trespass → punitive damages available even without compensatory/actual damages.

**Why?** The real harm = **loss of the right to exclude itself**, not physical damage. The law protects this right even when:
- The owner's reason is unreasonable (AP fear was baseless)
- The owner's behavior wasn't "neighborly" (they refused payment, called witnesses)
- No actual property damage occurred

**Policy underneath**: Without strong remedies, trespass becomes "pay $1 and do it anyway" for repeat players. This deters self-help violence and vindicates an important right independent of measurable harm. #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Note**: State Farm v. Campbell (post-Jacque, 2003) says punitive/compensatory ratios > 9:1 are "presumptively suspect" constitutionally. Today's courts would likely reduce $100,000:1 substantially—but it's only a defeasible presumption.

---

### C. ORGANIZATIONAL NOTE: The shift

- **Classes 1-5**: Acquisition (first possession, adverse possession)
- **Class 6 onward**: Two new questions:
  - (Moore) What kinds of things CAN/SHOULD be property?
  - (Jacque) What rights come with ownership?

---

## 2. Exam Signals #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Explicit signals:**

- [ ] **Possession ≠ ownership**: Renter has possession but not ownership; landlord has ownership but not possession (during lease term). Conversion requires interference with EITHER. This distinction is "important in property law... a technical distinction, but an important one." #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Bundle of rights has limits**: Even if ownership is malleable (add/remove sticks), at some point you've removed so many rights that what's left "just is no longer property." Court's analysis depends on this. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Three examples of restricted property from Mosk's dissent**: (1) In bankruptcy: can sell but can't give away (fraudulent transfer); (2) Recreational fishing: can give away but can't sell (need commercial license); (3) Prescription drugs: can neither give away nor sell. ALL are still property despite restrictions. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Informed consent as alternative to property rights**: Court says you don't need to "force the round pegs of privacy and dignity into the square hole of property" because informed consent rules protect patients adequately. But does informed consent REALLY protect someone who's near death and told "we need to remove your spleen"? #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Institutional competence argument**: Court says legislature, not courts, should decide whether to extend conversion law to body parts—legislature has democratic legitimacy, can get expert testimony, is better positioned than courts. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Right to exclude = central to property**: Jacques didn't need a good reason to refuse access. Even unreasonable refusal is protected. Punitive damages vindicate the RIGHT itself, not physical harm. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Assembly costs / property can lock things up**: If cell donors get property rights, scientists must negotiate with each donor → impedes socially productive research. Same concern as assembly problems from earlier. #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Implicit signals:**

- [ ] **Tangible vs. intangible personal property matters**: The fancy scroll (bar admission certificate) is tangible personal property—you can sell it. The LICENSE is intangible—you cannot sell or transfer it. "This is why it's important to distinguish." #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Calling something "intellectual property" is "a conclusion of an argument, not the start"**: Professor's old professor (a Marxist) refused to call the course "Intellectual Property"—called it "Regulation of Information Production and Exchange." Whether something IS property is the question, not the assumption. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Practical irrelevance of Moore**: Every surgical consent form now includes a waiver of rights to excised tissue. Professor discovered this firsthand. "As a practical matter, even if you had a property right, you can contract around that." But how much REAL choice does an ER patient have? #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Bio-piracy debate**: Pharmaceutical companies taking indigenous plants/knowledge → making billions → giving nothing back. Variant of Moore problem at global scale. Who should benefit from these discoveries? #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Steenberg Homes: adverse possession risk was ZERO**: Permission defeats hostility; one crossing can't satisfy statutory period. Jacques' stated reason was nonsensical—but that doesn't matter because right to exclude doesn't require a good reason. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **14 years of litigation about a mobile home delivery**: "Demonstrating once again the fundamental rule of the law and of the universe: lawyers get paid." #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **State Farm v. Campbell (footnote)**: Post-1997, punitive damages > 9:1 ratio to compensatories are "presumptively suspect" constitutionally. 100,000:1 would likely be challenged today—but it's a defeasible presumption. #EXAM_SIGNAL

## 3. Prep vs. Reality Comparison

**What prep predicted correctly:**
- ✅ Jacque v. Steenberg Homes: right to exclude, nominal + punitive damages, intentional trespass
- ✅ Policy tension: strong exclusion (rules) vs. reasonableness (standards)
- ✅ Adverse possession connection (permission defeats hostility)
- ✅ Trespass = protects exclusive possession

**What prep missed / professor emphasized more:**
- ❌ **Moore v. Regents consumed the entire first hour**—prep didn't cover it at all (it was in a different assignment section). This was a major topic: commodification, bundle of rights, body parts as property.
- ❌ **Bundle of rights conception** was a major teaching point, not just background.
- ❌ **Commodification** as organizing concept—connected to first-day discussion of places in line, slavery, intellectual property.
- ❌ **Institutional competence** argument for why courts should defer to legislature.
- ❌ **Mosk dissent** and the three examples of restricted-but-still-property (bankruptcy, fishing, prescription drugs) were major discussion points.
- ❌ **Hinman (airspace) and Baker (repeated trespasses/injunction) were NOT covered this class**—likely pushed to next session.
- ❌ **Professor spent significant time on practical implications**: consent forms now include waivers; bio-piracy debate; real-world bargaining dynamics of near-death patients.

## 4. Doctrinal Insights

### A. Moore v. Regents of the University of California (Cal. 1990)

#### Facts

- **Moore** diagnosed with leukemia, treated at UCLA by **Dr. Golde**.
- Golde recommended **spleen removal** to slow disease progression. Moore consented to surgery.
- Golde **did not disclose**: Moore's spleen had unusual characteristics; Golde planned to do research on white blood cells from it.
- After surgery, Golde created a **new cell line** from Moore's spleen cells → got a **patent** on behalf of scientists and UCLA.
- Patent rights sold: $440,000/3 years (~$1M today). Estimated potential market: **$3 billion/year** (~$7B today, adjusted).
- Moore found out, sued for **conversion** (taking personal property without owner's consent).

#### Part 1: Does Existing Conversion Law Cover This?

**Conversion requires interference with right of POSSESSION or OWNERSHIP.**

**Possession**: NO interference.
- Moore had no expectation of retaining spleen after surgery. (Imagine: "Good news, the operation was a success. Here's your spleen." → Nobody wants that.)
- No possessory interest infringed.

**Ownership**: NO, for three reasons:

1. **Patent law doctrines** (mentioned but not elaborated in class).

2. **No judicial precedent** supports Moore's claim. Court: not surprising because laws governing "human tissues, transplantable organs, blood, fetuses, pituitary glands, corneal tissue, and dead bodies deal with human biological materials as objects **sui generis**"—regulating their disposition to achieve policy goals, not abandoning them to "the general law of personal property."

3. **California biomedical waste statutes** drastically limit what patients can do with excised cells. Statutes require disposal in specified ways. Court: These statutes "eliminate so many of the rights ordinarily attached to property that one cannot simply assume that what is left amounts to property or ownership for purposes of conversion law."
   - **Bundle of rights logic**: Too many sticks removed → no longer a bundle → no longer property.

**Privacy/dignity argument rejected**: Court: "One may earnestly wish to protect privacy and dignity without accepting the extremely problematic conclusion that interference with those interests amounts to conversion of personal property." Alternative protections exist (informed consent, fiduciary duty).
- Key quote: No need to "force the round pegs of privacy and dignity into the square hole of property."

#### Part 2: Should Conversion Law Be Extended?

**Court's social balancing**: Scientific research interest > Moore's individual interest.
- Giving property rights to cell donors → scientists must worry about lurking non-consent claims → **impedes research** → bad for society (especially cancer research).
- Assembly costs problem: Property rights can "lock up" things needed for socially productive activity.
- Moore's privacy/dignity protected adequately by informed consent rules.

**Institutional competence argument**: Whether to extend conversion law = fraught policy question with arguments on both sides → **legislature** (not courts) should decide.
- Legislature has democratic legitimacy, can get expert testimony, better positioned.

#### Mosk Dissent

**Property rights argument**: The fact that California restricts what you can do with excised cells ≠ they're not property. Three examples of property with similar restrictions:

| Property | Can Sell? | Can Give Away? | Still Property? |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Assets in bankruptcy | ✅ (fair market value) | ❌ (fraudulent transfer) | ✅ |
| Recreationally caught fish | ❌ (need commercial license) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Prescription drugs | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Professional license | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

**Commodification argument (Mosk)**: Allowing scientists/industrialists to "appropriate and exploit a patient's tissue for their sole economic benefit" = "tends to treat the human body as a commodity." Akin to slavery.

**Unfair bargaining critique**: Informed consent doesn't protect someone near death who's told "we need to remove your spleen." Patient focused on survival, not negotiating research terms.

#### What Happened to Moore

- Didn't get property rights → didn't cash in on billions (which never materialized—research didn't pan out).
- **Died in 2001 of leukemia**. BUT: surgery was highly successful—he was near death in 1976, cancer went into remission for 20 years.
- Lived an adventurous life: started a college in Guadalajara, was surveying engineer on Alaska oil pipeline, photographer for Anchorage, ran a worm farm.

#### Practical Aftermath

- Every surgical consent form now includes waiver of rights to excised tissue.
- Professor's personal experience: discovered the waiver when having minor surgery, gave the young doctor "an impromptu lecture on Moore v. Regents."
- Even if property right existed, "you can contract around that."
- But: How much real choice does an ER/surgery patient have? Probably none.

### B. Commodification

**Definition**: Taking things that should NOT be subject to market exchange and making them subject to market exchange.

**Normative term**: Typically negative in legal context ("commodification is bad").

**Key examples discussed:**
- Body parts (Moore)
- People (slavery—"not viewed as a good thing... not everybody would agree about that, even today on this planet")
- Intellectual property (is it really "property"?)
- Places in line (Day 1 callback)

**Bio-piracy connection**: Pharmaceutical companies take indigenous plants/knowledge → make billions → give nothing to locals. Even when locals had traditional knowledge of medicinal use. How do you apportion value between indigenous knowledge (necessary condition) and pharma company's R&D?

**Blood donation study (Australia)**: Paying people to donate blood → blood donations DROPPED overall. Civic duty framing → market transaction framing = less motivation. Cautionary tale about commodification effects.

### C. Bundle of Rights Conception of Property (Ownership)

**Core idea**: Ownership = bundle of sticks (bundle of rights).
- Remove one stick → still a bundle.
- Add a stick → still a bundle.
- Swap a stick → still a bundle.
- Remove enough sticks → just one stick → NOT a bundle anymore.

**Used by Moore majority** (implicitly): California statutes removed so many rights that what's left isn't property.

**Used by Mosk dissent** (to argue the opposite): Other things have similar rights removed and are STILL property.

**Key question**: Is the bundle infinitely malleable, or is there a floor? Court says there IS a floor—at some point, you've removed too much and it's no longer property.

**Important caveat**: "Not everyone buys this view" but it is "ubiquitous in American 1L property courses and probably overwhelmingly subscribed to by American property academics... and therefore by judges because they all went to law school."

**Modern significance**: Whether something is "property" matters for:
- **Takings law / eminent domain**: Government takes your property → must compensate. Government regulates (not taking property) → no compensation required.
- **Fourth Amendment**: If you have a property right, there are search and seizure limitations.

### D. Jacque v. Steenberg Homes, Inc. (Wis. 1997)

#### Facts

- Harvey and Lois Jacque owned **170-acre** property (~1/5 size of Central Park; ~5x Columbia Morningside campus).
- Neighbor bought mobile home from **Steenberg Homes**; price included free delivery.
- Delivery day: Road had **up to 7 feet of snow** and a sharp turn → difficult delivery.
- Steenberg asked to cut across Jacque property → **repeatedly refused**.
- Steenberg offered **money** → refused.
- Jacques' stated reason: worried about adverse possession (they'd lost property before to AP).
- **AP risk was actually zero**: Permission defeats hostility; delivery takes hours, not statutory period (minimum 5 years anywhere).
- **Steenberg delivered anyway** ("traditional American way: said screw it, we're gonna do it anyway").
- Jacques called sheriff, got neighbors + town chairman as witnesses, had map and plat book ready.

#### Holding

- Steenberg conceded trespass on appeal (can't hide a mobile home delivery).
- **$1 nominal damages** (no actual harm to property—probably never even touched the dirt under the snow).
- **$100,000 punitive damages** ($200K in today's dollars).
- **Rule**: For intentional trespass, punitive damages CAN be awarded even absent actual/compensatory damages.

#### Reasoning

**Traditional rule**: No punitive damages without actual compensatory damages.
- **Rationale**: Punitive damages deter socially undesirable conduct. No need to deter acts that cause no actual harm.

**Court's rejection**: This rationale doesn't apply to **intentional** torts (as opposed to accidental).
- **Meares v. Harvey (1814) hypo**: Stranger walks along your paved walkway, staring through dining room window at you eating dinner. No damage to property, no physical harm. Under traditional rule → no remedy at all. But if "the defendant won't act like a gentleman, then heavy damages are required to deter it."

**The REAL harm**: Loss of the **right to exclude**—a legally protected interest independent of physical damage.
- Whether Jacques SHOULD have excluded is irrelevant.
- Whether their reason was good (it wasn't—AP risk was zero) is irrelevant.
- The right to exclude is protected even when exercised unreasonably.

**Policy rationales for strong exclusion right:**
- **Avoid self-help**: If law doesn't provide strong remedy, owners will escalate privately (threats, violence, physical resistance).
- **Deterrence**: Without punitives, trespass becomes "pay $1 and do it anyway" option for repeat players.
- **Vindicate rights**: Some rights deserve protection even absent measurable harm.

#### Key Questions Raised

**Was the Jacqueses' behavior "neighborly"?**
- They repeatedly refused, refused payment, called witnesses, had maps ready.
- If Steenberg wasn't acting like a gentleman, were the Jacques?
- Court: Doesn't matter—property right to exclude doesn't require reasonableness.

**Should the law promote "neighborly accommodation"?**
- Counter-argument: If we require reasonableness, we turn the right to exclude into a standard (balancing test) rather than a rule (absolute right). This weakens property rights and creates uncertainty.
- Rules vs. standards again: Strong exclusion = rule. Reasonableness requirement = standard.

**State Farm v. Campbell footnote:**
- Decided AFTER Jacque (1997 vs. 2003).
- Punitive/compensatory ratio > 9:1 is "presumptively suspect" constitutionally.
- 100,000:1 would likely be challenged today—but presumption is defeasible.

**Professor's poll**: ~40% of class thought Jacques should own the spleen / case rightly decided. ~30% disagreed. ~30% "questioning their life choices." → Professor will continue this debate next class.

## 5. Policy Arguments

### Should Body Parts Be Ownable Property?

**For (Moore should have property rights):**
- What starts as yours should remain yours—removal from body isn't morally relevant distinction (like iPhone falling out of pocket).
- Autonomy: Property rights = control over your body. "Your body, your choice."
- Organ donation analogy: We require consent for organ donation → implies person owns organs.
- Unfair bargaining: Informed consent doesn't protect near-death patients.
- Mosk: Allowing exploitation of patient's tissue without compensation = "akin to slavery."
- Labor theory (student argument): You maintained the organ (eating, sleeping) → invested labor.

**Against (Moore should NOT have property rights):**
- Scientific research > individual interest (social balancing).
- Property rights → assembly costs → impedes research (scientists must negotiate with each donor).
- Informed consent adequately protects privacy/dignity.
- Slippery slope: If body parts are property, can you chop off your hand and sell it? Van Gogh's ear?
- Commodification concerns: Creates markets for body parts → exploitation of vulnerable populations.
- Blood donation study: Monetizing → reduces civic donations.
- Institutional competence: Legislature should decide, not courts.

### Should the Right to Exclude Be Absolute?

**For absolute right (Jacque majority):**
- Clarity: Property owners know their rights; no balancing test needed.
- Deterrence: Without strong remedies, trespass is under-deterred.
- Prevent self-help: Strong legal remedy → owners don't resort to violence.
- Precedent value: Protects ALL property owners, including vulnerable ones.
- The right itself has value independent of measurable harm.

**Against absolute right (potential counter-arguments):**
- Waste: Absolute exclusion enables holdout/waste (cheapest route blocked for no good reason).
- Neighborliness: Law should encourage cooperation, not entrenchment.
- Proportionality: $100,000 for a mobile home crossing snow-covered land seems disproportionate.
- Reasonableness: Property rights should have reasonableness limits (like most other rights).

## 6. Outline Inserts (copy-ready)

### Insert: Moore v. Regents — Body Parts Are Not Property

```markdown
**Moore v. Regents of the University of California (Cal. 1990):**

**Holding:** Excised spleen cells are NOT property under conversion law. Court declines to extend conversion law to cover body parts.

**Two-part analysis:**

**Part 1 (Existing law):** Conversion requires interference with possession or ownership.
- No possession: Patient has no expectation of retaining excised organ.
- No ownership: (a) No precedent; (b) biological materials are "sui generis"—regulated by specialized statutes, not general property law; (c) California biomedical waste statutes eliminate so many rights that what's left isn't property (bundle of rights logic).
- Privacy/dignity argument rejected: "No need to force round pegs of privacy and dignity into the square hole of property"—informed consent protects these interests.

**Part 2 (Should law extend?):** No.
- Scientific research interest > individual interest (social balancing).
- Property rights → assembly costs → impede research.
- Informed consent adequately protects patients.
- Institutional competence: Legislature, not courts, should decide.

**Mosk dissent:**
- Other property has similar restrictions (bankruptcy assets, recreational fish, prescription drugs, professional licenses) and is STILL property.
- Commodification concern: Allowing exploitation without compensation = "akin to slavery."
- Unfair bargaining: Near-death patient can't meaningfully negotiate.

**Key concepts:** Commodification, bundle of rights, possession vs. ownership, sui generis, institutional competence, assembly costs.

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: Bundle of Rights Conception

```markdown
**Bundle of Rights (conception of property ownership):**

- Ownership = bundle of sticks (bundle of rights: use, exclude, transfer, destroy, etc.).
- Remove one stick → still a bundle / still property.
- But remove ENOUGH sticks → just a stick → NOT property anymore.
- **Ubiquitous** in American property law (academics, judges, 1L courses).
- **Not universally accepted** ("not everyone buys this view").

**Moore application:** California statutes eliminated so many rights from excised cells that remaining rights ≠ property.
**Mosk counter:** Other things lose same rights and remain property. Where is the line?

**Why it matters:**
- Takings: Government takes property → must compensate. Regulates → no compensation.
- Fourth Amendment: Property right → search/seizure protections.

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: Possession vs. Ownership

```markdown
**Possession ≠ Ownership (technical but important distinction):**

- **Possession** = physical control + right to occupy/use.
- **Ownership** = title; bundle of rights (transfer, exclude, use, destroy).
- Often overlap but are legally distinct.

**Classic example:** Renter has possession (can live there, put in furniture); landlord has ownership (can sell building) but NOT possession during lease.

**Conversion requires interference with EITHER possession OR ownership.**

**Moore:** No interference with possession (didn't want spleen back) AND no interference with ownership (statutes eliminated enough rights that what's left ≠ ownership).

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: Jacque v. Steenberg Homes — Right to Exclude

```markdown
**Jacque v. Steenberg Homes, Inc. (Wis. 1997):**

**Facts:** Delivery company intentionally drives mobile home across 170-acre property after repeated refusal + offer of payment. No physical damage (7 ft of snow; probably never touched dirt). Jacques' stated reason for refusing: AP concern (risk was actually zero—permission defeats hostility; one crossing ≠ statutory period).

**Holding:** $1 nominal + $100,000 punitive damages for intentional trespass. Punitive damages available even absent actual/compensatory damages for intentional trespass.

**The real harm:** Loss of the RIGHT to exclude (not physical damage).

**Rule:** Right to exclude is protected even when exercised unreasonably. Owner doesn't need a good reason to refuse access.

**Policy:**
- Deterrence: Without punitives, trespass = "pay $1 and do it anyway."
- Prevent self-help: Strong legal remedy → owners don't resort to violence.
- Vindicate rights: Some rights deserve protection independent of measurable harm.

**Meares v. Harvey hypo (1814):** Stranger walks your walkway, stares through window at dinner—no damage but should have remedy. "If defendant won't act like a gentleman, heavy damages are required."

**Note:** State Farm v. Campbell (2003, post-Jacque): Punitive/compensatory ratio > 9:1 is presumptively constitutionally suspect. 100,000:1 would face scrutiny today (but defeasible presumption).

## 9. Hypos & Examples from Class

### Hypo 1: iPhone vs. Spleen Analogy
- iPhone in pocket = yours. Falls out = still yours. Removal from your person ≠ end of ownership.
- Spleen in body = yours. Surgically removed = ...not yours?
- Counter: iPhone was always a transferable commodity. Spleen is sui generis.

### Hypo 2: Van Gogh's Ear
- Van Gogh chops off ear. If body parts = property, could he sell it?
- Today: Van Gogh's ear = enormously valuable.
- Concern: Creating markets for self-mutilation is bad.

### Hypo 3: Organ Donation Analogy (Student)
- We require consent for organ donation (driver's license checkbox).
- Implies person owns organs. Why treat Moore's spleen differently?
- Counter: Two ways to resolve inconsistency—make organ donation rules consistent with Moore, OR make Moore consistent with organ donation rules.

### Hypo 4: Meares v. Harvey — Window Peeper
- Stranger walks paved walkway, stares through dining room window at dinner.
- No damage to property, no physical harm.
- Under traditional rule (no punitives without actual damages): NO remedy.
- Under Jacque rule: Punitive damages available because right to exclude was violated.

### Hypo 5: Jacque — Mobile Home Delivery
- 170 acres, 7 ft of snow, sharp turn on road. Steenberg asked, offered money, refused.
- Jacques' AP fear = irrational (zero risk). Still protected.
- What if Steenberg offered $5,000? Doesn't change doctrine—only changes policy instincts.

## 10. Connections to Prior & Future Classes

### Connections Back
- **First possession** (Classes 1-2): Body parts = ultimate first possession (born with them). But being first possessor doesn't make everything property.
- **Adverse possession** (Classes 3-5): Jacque connects directly—Jacques worried about AP, but permission defeats hostility. Right to exclude is the flip side of AP (if you don't exclude, you may lose property to adverse possessor—though not in this fact pattern).
- **Places in line** (Day 1): Commodification question—should you be able to sell your place in line? Same question applied to body parts.
- **Armory v. Delamerie** (sequential possession): Relativity of title. Now asking: what counts as the KIND of thing that can have title at all?

### Looking Ahead
- **Hinman v. Pacific Air Transport** (airspace): Limits of right to exclude upward—not covered this class, likely next.
- **Baker v. Howard County Hunt** (repeated trespasses/injunction): Not covered this class, likely next.
- **Trespass to land (continued)**: Professor's poll on whether Jacque was rightly decided → will continue this debate next class.
- **Nuisance** (future): Alternative framework for interference with property (vs. trespass).
- **Takings / eminent domain** (end of course): Whether something IS property determines whether government must compensate for taking it.

## 11. Administrative Notes

- **February 17 (Tuesday after President's Day): NO CLASS** — Brooklyn Law schedule conflict.
- **Makeup session: Friday, February 20, 11:30 a.m.–1:20 p.m., Room 104** (across elevator banks). Different time, different room. Details on new syllabus installment (Courseworks). Will be recorded.
- **Professor's voice issues**: Cold; nursing voice throughout class. Microphone adjustments ("nonlinear" volume). Students should alert him if inaudible.
- **Professor's warning about gambling apps**: Delete prediction market/gambling apps. Legal profession is "highly conducive to addictive behavior." Re-registration packet every 2 years includes alcoholism hotline card. Gambler's fallacy + access to client money = dangerous combination.
- **Pro tip: bar admission scroll**: Pay the extra $20-30 for hand-calligraphed scroll. "Best bargain in the law." Takes 6 months (hand calligraphed). Also: signing name in the giant book of lawyers = "maybe the single coolest thing I've done as a lawyer."

## 12. Study Tips / Exam Preparation

✅ **Know Moore's two-part structure cold**: (1) Does existing conversion law cover this? (No—no possession, no ownership because bundle depleted.) (2) Should conversion law be extended? (No—scientific research > individual interest; informed consent suffices; legislature should decide.)

✅ **Possession ≠ ownership**: Know the distinction and be able to give the renter/landlord example.

✅ **Bundle of rights**: Ownership = malleable bundle, but has limits. Know Moore majority's use AND Mosk's counter-examples (bankruptcy, fishing, drugs, professional license).

✅ **Commodification**: Know the term, its normative valence, and key examples (body parts, slavery, IP, bio-piracy, blood donation study).

✅ **Jacque rule**: Intentional trespass → punitive damages available even without actual damages. Right to exclude protected even when exercised unreasonably.

✅ **Argue both sides**: For every question ("should body parts be property?" / "was Jacque rightly decided?"), be ready to argue both sides with specific policy reasons.

✅ **Institutional competence**: When should courts defer to legislatures? Moore says yes (fraught policy, democratic legitimacy, expert testimony). Jacque says courts CAN act (protecting existing property rights).

✅ **Sui generis**: Biological materials are their own category, regulated by specialized statutes, not general property law.

✅ **Know the State Farm footnote**: 9:1 ratio limit on punitive/compensatory damages (post-Jacque). Defeasible presumption.

**BOTTOM LINE FOR EXAM**: Moore = body parts are NOT property (conversion law doesn't cover; court won't extend). Know the bundle-of-rights logic, the commodification concern, Mosk's counter-examples, and the institutional competence argument. Jacque = right to exclude is paramount, protected even when unreasonable, with nominal + punitive damages available for intentional trespass. Be able to argue both sides on whether these results are correct.
