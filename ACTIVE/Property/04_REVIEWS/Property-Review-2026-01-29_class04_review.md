# Review — Class #4 — 2026-01-29 — Adverse Possession + Ad Coelum + Sequential Possession

---

## 1. What Professor Emphasized (3-5 main points)

1. **Ad Coelum rule links ownership of surface to ownership of subsurface/airspace, but is subject to limitations.** *Cuius est solum eius est ad coelum et ad inferos* ("whoever owns the soil owns everything above to the heavens and below to hell") creates a wedge/cone of ownership. But this is a "legal fiction" (Empson) that extends short stakes into long spokes—the law gives dominion over realms you cannot physically control. #EXAM_SIGNAL

2. **Access and ability to use a resource is central to determining who should own it (dissent in Edwards v. Sims).** The dissent argues owners should only own what they can "subject to dominion and control and use for benefit." If you cannot access a resource (like a cave you can't reach), you shouldn't have property rights in it. This connects to incentive arguments—no point giving rights to someone who can't exploit the resource. #EXAM_SIGNAL

3. **Relativity of title: Earlier possessors have rights good against later possessors (but not true owner).** Armory v. Delamere establishes that a finder has "special property"—rights good against "all but the rightful owner." This creates a hierarchy: true owner > first finder > second finder > subsequent converters. Each possessor has better title than those who come after. #EXAM_SIGNAL

4. **Information-forcing rules create incentives to produce evidence by imposing harsh presumptions.** In Armory, the court presumed the stolen jewel was "of the finest water" (highest quality) unless the defendant produced it. This defeasible presumption forces the party with information (who took the jewel) to bring it to court or suffer maximum damages. #EXAM_SIGNAL

5. **American property law strongly favors resource utilization and certainty over abstract fairness.** The majority in Edwards v. Sims applies ad coelum to give Lee (the neighboring landowner) rights to the cave portion under his land (even though he can't access it) because certainty and clear rules matter. Edwards owned the cave entrance and tourism business but had to stop using the portion under Lee's property. Court rejects exceptions based on "can't use it" because that creates uncertainty about property boundaries. #EXAM_SIGNAL

## 2. Exam Signals #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Explicit signals:**
- [ ] "Law makes long spokes of the short stakes of men" (Empson) — Exam will test understanding that property extends legal control beyond physical capability; question whether this is justified #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] "Should the rules be different for" mines vs. caves (depletable vs. non-depletable resources) — Expect analysis of how resource characteristics affect property rules #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] "Any other rule would lead to endless series of unlawful seizures" (Anderson v. Gouldberg) — Recurring justification for protecting even wrongful possessors against later wrongdoers #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Ad coelum rule is subject to limits (professor emphasized this repeatedly) — Will need to identify when exceptions apply (airplanes case coming) #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Implicit signals:**
- [ ] Spent 40+ minutes on Edwards v. Sims, extensively on dissent's access/use argument — Expect exam questions requiring evaluation of competing ownership principles (access vs. certainty) #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Repeatedly emphasized "information asymmetry" and incentive structure in Armory — Core analytical framework for property doctrine design #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Class discussion on whether Lee or Edwards should win split ~40-40-20 (some wanted government ownership) — Exam will test ability to argue multiple sides of allocation disputes #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Professor noted Edwards may have been "sharp operator" who cut out actual cave discoverer — Equitable considerations (who deserves to benefit) vs. formal legal rules #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Detailed explanation of why first converter beats second converter — Hierarchy of possession will be tested with variations (finder-finder, converter-converter, finder-converter) #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] New York found property statute (§§251-258) walk-through — Finder duties are testable; know obligation to turn in property worth $20+ #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Great Kentucky Cave Wars backstory (skullduggery, fake cops, tourist competition) — Context shows courts decide cases aware of real-world incentives and misbehavior #EXAM_SIGNAL

## 3. Corrections to Prep

**Expected coverage:** Full dive into adverse possession elements (actual, exclusive, open/notorious, hostile, continuous + time). Cases: Scott v. Anderson-Tully, Carpenter v. Ruperto, Howard v. Kunto.

**Actually covered:** 
- Brief mention of adverse possession as "upcoming topic" (~2 min at end: "poor kid who finds jewel" into sequential possession)
- **Instead:** 40 minutes on **Edwards v. Sims** (ad coelum / subsurface ownership)
- 25 minutes on **Armory v. Delamere** + sequential possession (Clark v. Maloney, Anderson v. Gouldberg)
- 5-10 minutes on **practical found property law** (NY statutes)

**Lesson for prep:** Professor is not rigidly following casebook order. The "adverse possession" assignment pivoted to subsurface rights and sequential possession—likely because these connect thematically (first possession → relativity of title → adverse possession will follow). Prep must include flexibility for professor's thematic groupings, not just assigned pages.

**Why this matters:** Adverse possession prep (elements, claim-of-right tests, tacking) was not wasted—it's clearly coming next class, but now we have additional context about relativity of title and first possession that will frame AP when we get there.

## 4. Doctrinal Insights

### Ad Coelum Rule (*Cuius est solum eius est ad coelum et ad inferos*)

**Black-letter rule:** Ownership of surface land includes ownership of everything above it (to the sky) and below it (to the center of the earth).

**Practical application:**
- Surface owner owns subsurface minerals, groundwater, caves
- Surface owner owns airspace (but subject to limits—airplane case coming)
- Creates a geometric wedge/cone of ownership extending from the parcel boundaries

**Two competing frameworks presented in Edwards v. Sims:**

**Parties:** Edwards owned the cave entrance and developed a lucrative tourism business. Lee was neighboring landowner who sued, claiming part of cave extended under his land.

1. **Majority (pro ad coelum) — ruled for Lee:**
   - Cave = mine analogy: you own what's below your land
   - Certainty and predictability are paramount
   - Avoids line-drawing problems (how deep is "yours"?)
   - Benefits include: clear rules, easy to administer, promotes investment
   - Lee owns the portion of cave under his property, even though he can't access it

2. **Dissent (access limitation) — favored Edwards:**
   - Owner should only own what they can "subject to dominion and control and use for benefit"
   - If you can't access the cave (no entrance on your land), no ownership
   - "Ownership should go with the entrance" (accession principle)
   - Prevents holdouts and rewards the party who invested in making the resource valuable
   - "Cave was [Edwards's] because he had made it what it was...his vision translated into reality"
   - Edwards discovered the cave, developed it over 13 years, built the business—he should own it all

**Professor's analytical framework: Four types of "can't":**
1. Physically impossible for anyone (e.g., can't flap arms and fly to moon)
2. Physically impossible for you but not others (can't score on NBA players, but others can)
3. Economically impossible for you but not others (can't afford to drill, but someone could)
4. Temporarily impossible but solvable (can't drill *yet* but could with financing/technology)

**Critical insight:** If you own subsurface resource you can't personally access, you can still benefit:
- **Sell the land** (market price = $10K surface + $100M gold, not just $10K)
- **Lease extraction rights** to party with drilling capability
- **Take loan** secured by the resource value
- **License access** for commission/royalty

→ So even "inability to access" doesn't mean "inability to benefit from ownership"

**→ This weakens the dissent's access argument:** Even if Lee (the neighboring landowner) can't physically enter the cave, Lee could sell/lease the subsurface rights to Edwards or a third party. So giving Lee the rights doesn't waste the resource.

**Counter to counter:** Dissent worried about holdout problem—Lee can demand unfair share because Edwards has already sunk costs into developing the cave/tourism business over 13 years (Lee "sees Edwards do all this stuff...then sees cave is a big hit and oh, now suddenly this portion under my land is mine").

**Policy context (Great Kentucky Cave Wars):**
- Cave tourism was major industry in 1920s Kentucky
- Competing cave owners engaged in "skullduggery": fake police stopping cars, misleading "official" signs
- Violence/intimidation to divert tourists
- Government trying to assemble Mammoth Cave National Park via eminent domain
- Court may have wanted to reduce holdout problems for government acquisition
- OR may have wanted to make it easier for government (fewer parties to negotiate with if ownership = entrance, not surface)
- OR may have thought shared ownership (multiple surface owners over one cave) reduces profit motive for dirty tactics

**Unresolved question (professor flagged):** How to handle **two entrances to same cave owned by different people**? If "own the entrance = own the cave," what happens when there are multiple entrances?

---

### Sequential Possession & Relativity of Title (Armory v. Delamere)

**Setup:** 
- True owner loses jewel → chimney sweep's boy (low-status, dangerous job, ~4 year life expectancy) finds it → takes to Paul de Lamerie (famous silversmith to King George I, extremely wealthy) → apprentice offers $1.55 → boy refuses → apprentice returns empty socket, keeps jewel

**Rule from Armory:** "The finder, though he does not by such finding acquire an absolute property or ownership, yet he has such a property as will enable him to keep it against all but the rightful owner."

**Key concepts:**

1. **Absolute property** = rights good against the entire world (true owner has this)
2. **Special property** = rights good against everyone *except* true owner (finder has this)
3. **Relativity of title** = property rights are relative, not absolute; each possessor has better rights than subsequent possessors

**Hierarchy of rights:**
```
True owner > First finder > Second finder > Converter (takes by theft/force)
       ↓           ↓              ↓                    ↓
  Absolute    Special        Special              Special
  property    property       property             property
  (good vs.   (good vs.      (good vs.            (good vs.
   world)      all but        all but true         all but true
               true owner)    owner + 1st          owner + 1st
                              finder)              finder + 2nd
                                                   finder)
```

**Case applications:**

**Clark v. Maloney** (true owner → finder → later finder):
- A owns logs → loses them → B finds logs → loses them → C finds logs
- Rule: B wins
- Rationale: "Loss of a chattel does not change the right of property"
- First finder's special property persists even after losing possession
- Second finder gets at best special property minus first finder's superior rights

**Anderson v. Gouldberg** (true owner → converter → later converter):
- A owns logs on land → B cuts them down (trespass) → C takes them from B (theft)
- Rule: B wins (first converter beats second converter)
- Rationale: "Any other rule would lead to endless series of unlawful seizures and reprisals"
- Policy: Don't want to incentivize stealing from thieves (would create cycle of violence/disorder)
- First wrongdoer has "possession good against all the world except those having better title"

**Unifying principle:** **First in time = first in right** (among non-true-owners)

---

### Information-Forcing Rules (Damages in Armory)

**Problem:** How should jury value the jewel when defendant (silversmith's apprentice) took it and won't produce it?

**Court's solution (information-forcing rule):**
1. **Identify party with information asymmetry:** Defendant knows what the jewel looks like (he has it); plaintiff doesn't (it was taken from him)
2. **Impose harsh defeasible presumption:** Jury should presume jewel was "of the finest water" (highest quality/most expensive) **unless** defendant produces the jewel and proves it was lower quality
3. **Result:** Defendant has strong incentive to produce the jewel or face maximum damages

**General structure:**
- Party with information faces very bad default presumption
- Presumption is defeasible (can be rebutted with evidence)
- Party brings evidence to avoid the bad presumption
- Court gets the information it needs to decide accurately

**Why this works:**
- Courts in Anglo-American system have no independent investigative power
- Courts can only know what parties bring them
- Need to structure incentives so parties bring relevant evidence
- Harsh presumption + ability to rebut = strong incentive to produce evidence

**Modern application:** "Penalty default" rules in contracts (will learn in Contracts course)

---

### Finder Duties (New York Law)

**Finder ≠ Absolute Owner.** Finder has **duties** to true owner.

**New York Personal Property Law §§251-258 (added 1958, partially amended later):**

**Property worth < $10:**
- Must make "reasonable efforts" to find true owner
- If unsuccessful after 1 year → finder may keep it
- [NOTE: $10 in 1958 = ~$100-120 today]

**Property worth $20+:**
- Must turn in to police within 10 days
- Police hold for statutory period (varies by value, up to 3 years)
- If true owner doesn't claim → finder gets it
- **Exception:** May turn in to owner/possessor of property where found (e.g., building front desk) instead of police

**Property worth $10.01-$19.99:**
- **LAWLESS ZONE in upstate NY** (statute never updated when they changed $10 to $20 for police turn-in requirement)
- NYC has separate ordinance: $10 cutoff for everything

**Penalties for non-compliance:**
- Upstate NY: misdemeanor, fine up to $100 and/or 6 months in jail
- NYC: fine up to $1,000 and/or 1 year in jail ("You're going to Rikers")

**Doctrinal terminology:** Finder acts as **bailee** for true owner (will learn bailment later).

**Key distinction from first possessor:**
- First possessor (e.g., catch a wild fox) → owns it absolutely
- Finder (e.g., find lost iPhone) → has special property + duties to return it

## 5. Policy Themes

### Justifications for Property Rules (Recurring)

**Autonomy:** Private property lets people govern their own lives ("a man's home is his castle")—not economic, but about human flourishing and freedom from interference

**Democracy (Jeffersonian):** Widespread property ownership is essential for healthy democracy (dispersed power, not concentrated)

**Economic efficiency:** Already covered (tragedy of commons, internalize costs/benefits)

### Equity vs. Formalism (Edwards dissent)

**Dissent's vision (equity):** "That which Edwards owns is something intangible and indefinable. It is his vision translated into reality." Property should reward labor, investment, risk-taking—not passive ownership.

**Majority's vision (formalism):** Ad coelum rule is certain, predictable, administrable. Equity-based exceptions create costly litigation and undermine investment.

**Professor's lesson:** Courts choose between rules (formalism) and standards (equity) based on trade-offs. No free lunch.

## 6. Historical Context & Color

### Chimney Sweep's Boy (Armory plaintiff)
- Bottom of social hierarchy; parents "sold" children into apprenticeship
- Extremely dangerous work: small children sent into narrow chimneys; sometimes got stuck and died
- Life expectancy: ~4 more years
- Finding the jewel = potential ticket to decent life
- William Blake's "The Chimney Sweeper" (1789/1794) criticized church complicity in child exploitation

### Paul de Lamerie (Armory defendant)
- Silversmith to King George I
- "Greatest silversmith working in England in the 18th century" (Victoria & Albert Museum)
- Work in museums today (Frick Collection has pieces)
- Reputation for "sharp dealing" / sketchy business practices
- Extremely wealthy and high-status

### Great Kentucky Cave Wars (Edwards v. Sims backdrop)
- 1920s: caving = major tourism (pre-Disneyland: "holes in the ground are what people had")
- Competing cave owners hired fake police to redirect tourists
- "Official cave information" booths that were actually competitor advertisements
- Edwards (who developed the Great Onyx Cave tourism business) allegedly cut out the actual cave discoverer (promised 50-50 split, then gave nothing; discoverer sued but died before case resolved)
- Violence and intimidation among cave operators
- Mammoth Cave National Park created via eminent domain (decades-long assembly process)
- Lee was adjoining landowner who sued Edwards claiming cave extended under his property

## 7. Doctrinal Traps & Exam Moves

**Trap #1:** Assuming ad coelum is absolute.
- **Reality:** Professor emphasized "ad coelum rule in general is basically American law, but there are limits on it"
- Airplane case is coming (hint: you don't own airspace up to literal heaven)
- Exam will test ability to identify when exceptions apply

**Trap #2:** Thinking "finder = owner."
- **Reality:** Finder has special property, not absolute property
- Finder has duties to true owner (make reasonable efforts to return, or turn in to police)
- True owner can sue to get property back

**Trap #3:** Assuming "inability to access = no ownership."
- **Reality:** Even if you can't personally access a resource, you can benefit by selling, leasing, or licensing rights
- Dissent's argument is weaker than it initially appears because of this
- But dissent's concern about holdouts/reliance remains valid

**Trap #4:** Confusing types of "can't."
- Physical impossibility (for anyone) ≠ economic impossibility (for you but not others)
- Matters for evaluating dissent's access argument

**Trap #5:** Thinking sequential possession is just "first come, first served."
- **Reality:** It's *relativity of title*—hierarchy of rights
- Each possessor has rights against later possessors but not earlier ones
- True owner always wins; but as between two wrongdoers, first in time = first in right

---

## 8. Exam Hypotheticals (Likely Variations)

**Hypo 1 (Ad Coelum + Access):**
A owns land. B discovers cave entrance on B's adjacent land; cave extends under A's land. B invests $1M developing cave for tourism. A sues for share of profits. Who wins?
- **Majority rule (Edwards v. Sims):** A owns portion of cave under A's land (ad coelum). B must stop using that portion or pay damages/profits to A.
- **Dissent rule:** B owns entire cave (entrance = ownership; A can't access it, so shouldn't own it)
- **Exam move:** Argue both sides; discuss certainty vs. equity; note A could have sold subsurface rights to B ex ante (weakens dissent); but B's reliance interest (A waited to sue until profitable) favors dissent. This is exactly the Edwards v. Sims fact pattern—Edwards = B, Lee = A.

**Hypo 2 (Sequential Possession Chain):**
A loses watch → B finds watch → C steals watch from B → D steals watch from C. Who has best claim (assume A never appears)?
- **Answer:** B (first finder) > C (first converter) > D (second converter)
- **Rationale:** Relativity of title; B has special property good against all but A; C's rights are at best good against all but A and B; D's rights are at best good against all but A, B, and C

**Hypo 3 (Information-Forcing):**
Plaintiff sues defendant for conversion of painting. Defendant sold it to unknown third party. Plaintiff claims it was a Van Gogh worth $10M; defendant says it was a worthless forgery. How should court determine damages?
- **Exam move:** Apply Armory information-forcing rule: presume it was genuine Van Gogh (high damages) unless defendant produces the painting or proves it was fake
- **Rationale:** Defendant created information asymmetry by disposing of the painting; harsh presumption forces defendant to bring evidence or face maximum damages

---

## 9. Connections to Prior Classes

**First Possession (Pierson v. Post, whaling cases):**
- All involved resources with no prior owner
- Armory introduces complication: what if there *is* a prior owner (or possessor)?
- Answer: relativity of title—earlier possession beats later possession

**Tragedy of Commons (Class 3):**
- Edwards v. Sims dissent worries about **anti-commons** (too many property rights → holdout)
- If surface ownership = subsurface ownership, then cave under multiple parcels has multiple owners → hard to assemble for efficient use
- But if entrance ownership = cave ownership, then only one owner → no holdout problem

**Natural/Artificial Wants (Evans v. Merriweather, Class 3):**
- Edwards v. Sims doesn't use this framework, but dissent's "vision translated into reality" echoes idea that productive/valuable use should be rewarded
- American property law's bias toward utilization (vs. natural flow rule's bias toward equality) → suggests majority approach (ad coelum for certainty) aligns with utilization goal

---

## 10. Open Questions & Next Class Predictions

**Open questions flagged by professor:**
1. **Airplane case:** How high up do you own? Ad coelum says "to the heavens" but that can't be literal.
2. **Two cave entrances:** If "own entrance = own cave," what happens when two people own separate entrances to same cave?
3. **Adverse possession:** Mentioned at end ("poor kid finds jewel" segue); next class will likely cover AP elements

**Predictions for next class:**
- Full adverse possession doctrine (actual, exclusive, open/notorious, hostile/claim of right, continuous, time)
- Cases: Scott v. Anderson-Tully, Carpenter v. Ruperto, Howard v. Kunto, Songbyrd v. Grossman
- Likely connection to sequential possession: AP is another way to get title by taking possession, but requires specific elements + time
- Expect discussion of "continuity" (seasonal use) and tacking (privity)

---

## 11. Quick Lookup: Rules to Memorize

**Ad Coelum (Black-Letter):** Surface owner owns everything above (to the sky) and below (to the center of the earth), subject to reasonable limitations.

**Armory Rule (Relativity of Title):** Finder has special property—rights good against all but the rightful owner.

**Sequential Possession Hierarchy:** True owner > first finder > second finder > first converter > second converter. General rule: earlier in time = better right.

**Information-Forcing Rule Structure:** (1) Identify party with information; (2) impose harsh defeasible presumption against them; (3) party brings evidence to rebut or faces bad outcome; (4) court gets information needed for accurate decision.

**Finder Duties (NY):** Property < $10: reasonable efforts + 1 year. Property $20+: turn in to police within 10 days; police hold for statutory period (up to 3 years); if not claimed, finder gets it. Penalties: upstate = $100 fine and/or 6 months jail; NYC = $1,000 fine and/or 1 year jail.

**Anderson v. Gouldberg Principle:** First converter beats later converter because "any other rule would lead to endless series of unlawful seizures and reprisals."

---

## 12. Professor Quotes to Remember

- "Law makes long spokes of the short stakes of men" (Empson)—ad coelum extends legal control beyond physical capability

- "That which Edwards owns is something intangible and indefinable. It is his vision translated into reality" (Edwards dissent)—property as reward for labor/creativity

- "The loss of a chattel does not change the right of property" (Clark v. Maloney)—losing possession ≠ losing property rights

- "Any other rule would lead to endless series of unlawful seizures and reprisals" (Anderson v. Gouldberg)—justification for protecting even wrongful possessors

- "If you're going to be worried about [ad coelum] in general, then you gotta think about what the alternative is"—no perfect rule; everything has trade-offs

- "Only the paranoid survive" (Andy Grove)—professor's advice on backing up your hard drives (digression, but memorable)

- "You're going to Rikers" (re NYC found property law)—NYC takes finder duties seriously

---

## 13. Study Priorities

**High priority (almost certain to be tested):**
- [ ] Relativity of title + sequential possession (Armory, Clark, Anderson)
- [ ] Ad coelum rule + limits (Edwards v. Sims majority vs. dissent)
- [ ] Information-forcing rules (Armory damages)
- [ ] Finder duties and New York statutes

**Medium priority (likely tested, or foundational for later topics):**
- [ ] Edwards v. Sims policy arguments (access vs. certainty)
- [ ] Distinguishing types of "can't" (physical, economic, temporal)
- [ ] Historical context (chimney sweeps, Great Kentucky Cave Wars)

**Lower priority (useful context, unlikely to be directly tested):**
- [ ] William Empson poem / literary references
- [ ] Paul de Lamerie's biography
- [ ] New York statute dollar amounts ($10 vs. $20 gap)

---

## 14. Integration Notes

**To add to outline:**
- Ad coelum doctrine (Edwards v. Sims)
- Sequential possession hierarchy (Armory v. Delamere)
- Finder duties (NY Personal Property Law)
- Information-forcing rules

**To create as prewrite:** None identified this class (mostly foundational doctrine).

**To flag for exam attack outline:**
- Relativity of title framework (true owner > finder > converter chain)
- Ad coelum majority vs. dissent arguments (certainty vs. access/equity)
- Information-forcing rule structure (4 steps)

---

## 15. Personal Study Notes / Questions

**Question for office hours:** How does ad coelum interact with adverse possession? If Lee can't access the cave, can Edwards adversely possess the subsurface by using it openly for 10+ years?

**Connection to other classes:** Information-forcing rules likely appear in Evidence (burdens of proof) and Contracts (penalty defaults).

**Practical takeaway:** If I find valuable property, turn it in to police or building security (if found on their property) within 10 days if worth $20+. Document everything (photos, written description) before turning in.
