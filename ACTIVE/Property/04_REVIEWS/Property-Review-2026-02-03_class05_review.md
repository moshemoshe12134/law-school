# Review — Class #5 — 2026-02-03 — Adverse Possession (Elements & Policy)

---

## 1. What Professor Emphasized (3-5 main points)

1. **The six hornbook elements of adverse possession must ALL be satisfied for title to ripen.** Professor spent significant time writing out and explaining each element: (1) Actual possession, (2) Exclusive, (3) Open and notorious, (4) Continuous, (5) Adverse/hostile under claim of right (or color of title in some jurisdictions), and (6) For the statutory period. These are "adjectival requirements"—adjectives modifying the noun "possession." Jurisdictions vary slightly but there's substantial overlap. #EXAM_SIGNAL

2. **"Continuous" does NOT mean uninterrupted 24/7—it means possession consistent with ordinary use of that type of property.** In *Howard v. Kunta*, summer-only occupancy of vacation property satisfied the continuity requirement because that was "ordinary use of property of a like nature." The nature of the property determines what counts as continuous. This is NOT "continual" (happening repeatedly)—it's "continuous" (without interruption for that type of property). #EXAM_SIGNAL

3. **Tacking allows adverse possessors to add their time to predecessors' time, but ONLY if privity exists between them.** In *Howard v. Kunta*, the Kuntas had only been there 1 year but could "tack" their period to predecessors' periods. Traditionally, privity required a deed changing hands. Here the deed was to the wrong lot (Lot A instead of Lot B). Court allowed tacking anyway because privity exists to "screen out trespassers and squatters"—the Kuntas weren't wrongdoers, just victims of a deed mistake. Privity requires "some reasonable connection" that elevates the claim above mere trespassing. #EXAM_SIGNAL

4. **"Adverse/hostile" means contrary to true owner's legal rights—NOT state of mind or animosity.** Professor emphasized this multiple times: "adverse" just means the possession is contrary to the true owner's rights (typically: without permission). It does NOT mean the possessor has ill will or hostility toward the owner—they can be best friends. Landlords don't worry about tenants adversely possessing because tenants have PERMISSION (lease), so possession isn't adverse. #EXAM_SIGNAL

5. **Three competing approaches to "claim of right" (good faith requirement) with most jurisdictions following the "Connecticut rule" (state of mind irrelevant).** (1) Good faith required (rare, but NY now requires "reasonable basis for belief"); (2) Bad faith required (the "Maine rule"—probably never actually followed); (3) State of mind irrelevant (most common—treat adverse possession as a specialized statute of limitations). *Carpenter v. Ruperto* (Iowa) required good faith and rejected the squatter's claim. Professor noted commentators prefer the Connecticut rule but New York explicitly changed to good faith in 2008 after front-page NYT coverage. #EXAM_SIGNAL

---

## 2. Exam Signals #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Explicit signals:**
- [ ] Professor wrote out all six elements on board and said "this is stuff you'll like because it's just straightforward things to memorize for the exam, the bar" #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] "The nature of the property" matters for determining what satisfies elements—repeatedly emphasized that law differs based on characteristics of the thing. "Property is the law of things." Acts sufficient for wild land may not be enough for improved land (and vice versa). #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Actual possession example: 2 acres fenced/improved on 50-acre parcel = only actual possession of 2 acres (not 50), which matters unless possessor has color of title #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Color of title: In some jurisdictions (including NY), actual possession of PART of parcel under color of title gives ownership of ENTIRE parcel (NY Real Property Actions § 512) #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Disabilities toll the statute ONLY if disability existed WHEN adverse possession began—if it arises after, no effect. Professor called this "utterly crazy" and "puzzles the heck out of me" but it's the rule. Hypo: true owner goes into coma day AFTER adverse possession starts = no tolling even if coma lasts 15 years. #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Implicit signals:**
- [ ] Terminology: Professor polled class on "chattels" vs. "movables" vs. "personal property"—settled on "personal property" (most liked it) but noted it should be "tangible personal property" to distinguish from intangibles like bank accounts #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Generic names: "Black Acre" (and Green Acre, White Acre, etc.) for parcels; "Ruritania" for countries in international law #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Open and notorious: Court quote about "unfurl his flag on the land and keep it flying so that the actual owner may see...that an enemy has invaded his domains"—Professor traced this quote back through cases to 1887 and found a typo that's been mindlessly repeated. Lesson: "If you don't understand something, figure it out. Don't mindlessly copy garbage." Same problem with AI hallucinations. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] *Scott v. Anderson Tully* adds "peaceful" as seventh element (not standard)—possession was peaceful because "no one complained" before title ripened, and "mere existence of expected disputes" doesn't make it not peaceful #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Exclusive means possessor must "evince an intention to possess to the exclusion of everyone else's claims" and give "unequivocal indication of exercising dominion of a sole owner"—these are OBJECTIVE tests (what observers would infer), not subjective #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Statutory periods: vary from 5 years (shortest) to 40 years (longest); NY = 10 years. "Just look it up." #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Policy justifications discussed:**
- [ ] Title clearing / "deed in the attic" problem—don't want someone showing up decades later with 1928 deed #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Evidentiary staleness—evidence from 30+ years ago is "lost in the mists of time" #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Reliance interests—people rely on possession over time, become psychologically attached; Oliver Wendell Holmes worried people might "get violent" if you take away property they've held long-term #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Fixes mistakes (like *Howard v. Kunta*—everyone got deed to wrong lot) #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] But: burdens true owners to monitor property and litigate; disadvantages elderly, sick, or resource-poor owners; "places a premium on dishonesty" (*Carpenter*) #EXAM_SIGNAL

## 3. Key Doctrines & Rules

### Six Hornbook Elements of Adverse Possession (Adjectival Requirements)

To acquire title by adverse possession, the claimant's possession must be:

1. **Actual** — Must actually possess the property (not constructive possession)
   - *Example*: Fencing/improving 2 acres of 50-acre parcel = actual possession of only 2 acres (not 50)
   - *Exception*: Color of title extends actual possession of part to whole parcel (see below)

2. **Exclusive** — Possess to exclusion of others' claims
   - *Scott v. Anderson Tully*: Must "evince an intention to possess to the exclusion of everyone else's claims" and give "unequivocal indication" of "exercising the dominion of a sole owner"
   - OBJECTIVE test (what conduct shows), not subjective
   - Can let others USE the property (just as true owner could invite guests)—doesn't defeat exclusivity
   - Cannot share possession with true owner

3. **Open and Notorious** — True owner had actual or constructive notice
   - Metaphor: possessor must "unfurl his flag on the land and keep it flying so that the actual owner may see...that an enemy has invaded his domains" 
   - "Open" = visible (could be seen)
   - "Notorious" = community understood the conduct as marking a property claim
   - *Scott v. Anderson Tully*: Blue paint marking property line was visible (open) AND community recognized it as dividing parcels (notorious)

4. **Continuous** — Uninterrupted possession **for that type of property**
   - NOT "continual" (repeated) but "continuous" (without interruption)
   - *Howard v. Kunta*: Summer-only occupancy satisfied continuity because neighborhood was "summer vacation land"—"ordinary use of property of a like nature"
   - Nature of property determines what's continuous (vacation home ≠ primary residence ≠ farmland ≠ wilderness)

5. **Adverse or Hostile, Under Claim of Right (or Color of Title)** — Two parts:
   
   **Part A: Adverse/Hostile** = Contrary to true owner's legal rights
   - Typically means: without permission
   - NOT about state of mind, animosity, or ill will
   - Tenants/lessees CANNOT adversely possess because they have permission (not adverse to owner's rights)
   
   **Part B: Claim of Right** = Three competing approaches to state of mind:
   
   | Approach | Requirement | Jurisdictions | Notes |
   |----------|-------------|---------------|-------|
   | **Good Faith** | Reasonable belief possessor owns property | Rare; *Carpenter v. Ruperto* (Iowa); **NY since 2008** (RPAPL: "reasonable basis for belief") | NY changed law after front-page NYT stories; good faith requirement screens out squatters |
   | **Bad Faith** ("Maine Rule") | Knowing you don't own it | Probably never actually followed; Maine repealed 1993 | Taught in every casebook but not followed |
   | **Connecticut Rule** | State of mind irrelevant | Most jurisdictions; favored by commentators | Treats adverse possession as specialized statute of limitations |
   
   - *Carpenter v. Ruperto*: Adverse possessor knew lot wasn't hers, claimed concern about rats, but installed propane tank. Court required good faith, possessor lost. "To allow a squatter to get ownership is to put a premium on dishonesty."
   - Empirical evidence (Richard Helmholtz study): judges may care about good faith even when law doesn't explicitly require it

   **Color of Title** = Formal document (deed, judgment) purporting to give title (but defective)
   - Some jurisdictions: doesn't matter
   - Some jurisdictions: required
   - Some jurisdictions: optional but gives advantages:
     - Shorter statutory period
     - **Actual possession of PART = ownership of WHOLE parcel** (NY RPAPL § 512)
   
   *Example (NY rule)*: "Known farm or single lot...partly improved, the portion...left not cleared or not enclosed according to usual course and custom of adjoining country is deemed to have been occupied for same length of time as part improved"
   - Note: Statute explicitly relies on **custom** to define "enclosed/improved"

6. **For Statutory Period** — Varies by jurisdiction (5-40 years; NY = 10 years)
   - Just look it up in your jurisdiction

**Additional Element (Some Jurisdictions):**
- **Peaceful** (*Scott v. Anderson Tully*) — No one complained before title ripened; "mere existence of expected disputes" doesn't defeat peaceful requirement

---

### Tacking Doctrine (*Howard v. Kunta*)

**Rule**: Adverse possessor can "tack" (add) their period of possession to predecessor's period IF privity exists between them.

**Traditional Privity Requirement**: Deed changing hands between possessors
- Problem in *Howard v. Kunta*: Deed was to Lot A, but parties occupied Lot B

**Modern Privity Rule (Court's holding)**: "Some reasonable connection between the person conveying and person receiving that raises receiver's claim of right above the status of wrongdoer or trespasser"
- **Purpose of privity**: Screen out trespassers and squatters
- Kuntas weren't trespassers—they paid money, thought they owned property (just victim of deed mistake)
- Tacking allowed

**Facts of *Howard v. Kunta***:
- 4 lots (A, B, C, D); A & D unimproved; B & C improved
- Everyone got deed to wrong lot due to "glitch": Kuntas had title to A but occupied B; Moyers had title to B but occupied C; Howards had title to C but occupied D
- Moyers & Howards swapped: Moyers got title to C (matching possession), Howards got title to B (still improved lot + probably cash)
- Kuntas claimed adverse possession of B (only there ~1 year, but tacked to predecessors)
- **Continuity issue**: Summer occupancy OK because "ordinary use" of vacation property
- **Tacking issue**: Privity satisfied despite wrong deed

---

### Disabilities Tolling Rule

**Rule**: Disability of true owner tolls (suspends) running of statute ONLY IF disability existed WHEN adverse possession began.

**Types of disabilities**: Infancy, coma, mental incapacity, etc.

**Critical timing rule**: Disability must exist at moment adverse possession starts
- Disability exists day BEFORE adverse possession starts → statute tolled
- Disability arises day AFTER adverse possession starts → NO EFFECT (even if disability lasts 15+ years)

**Professor's take**: "Utterly crazy...puzzles the heck out of me...I don't have the faintest idea why this makes sense"
- Compared to famous scholar who was equally puzzled
- Challenge: Try to make it make sense, or explain why rule exists if it doesn't make sense

---

### Special Rules

**Custom in Adverse Possession**: NY statute explicitly relies on "usual course and custom of adjoining country" to determine if land is "enclosed/improved"—example of law explicitly incorporating custom

**Acts Required Vary with Land Type** (*Scott v. Anderson Tully*): "Acts required to establish adverse possession may vary with characteristics of land. Acts insufficient for developed/improved land may be enough for unimproved or wild land."
- Upstate NY wilderness ≠ Midtown Manhattan

---

## 4. Key Cases

### *Scott v. Anderson Tully* (Miss. App. 2015) [CB 156]

**Facts**: Scott owned land. Anderson Tully removed timber from it. Anderson Tully had marked purported property line years earlier; disputed acreage was on Anderson Tully's side of line.

**Defense**: Adverse possession

**Holding**: Anderson Tully wins—adverse possession established

**Reasoning**:
- Listed 6 hornbook elements + "peaceful" (7th element, non-standard)
- "Peaceful": No one complained about survey or Anderson Tully's use before adverse possession ripened; "mere existence of expected disputes" doesn't defeat peaceful requirement
- "Claim of ownership": Term used (jurisdictions vary on terminology)
- Acts required vary with land characteristics—insufficient for developed land may suffice for wild/unimproved land
- Anderson Tully didn't seek permission → no permission → adverse to owner's rights
- Only ones using disputed tract → exclusive

**Key language**: Possessor must "unfurl his flag on the land and keep it flying so that actual owner may see, [and] if he will, that an enemy has invaded his domains and planted standard of conquest"
- This is METAPHOR—don't argue "no flag planted" in court
- Quote is corrupted (word "and" shouldn't be there)—Professor traced it back to 1887 original, found error has been mindlessly repeated through treatises and cases since 1987

---

### *Howard v. Kunta* (Wash. App. 1970) [CB 175]

**Facts**: 4 lots (A-D); deed mistakes caused everyone to have title to wrong lot. After swaps, Kuntas (occupied B, had title to A) claimed adverse possession of B.

**Issues**: 
1. Continuity—summer-only occupancy enough?
2. Tacking—can tack to predecessors' time despite wrong deed?

**Holdings**:
1. **Continuity**: Summer occupancy sufficient because neighborhood was "summer vacation property"—constituted "ordinary use of property of a like nature"
   - Distinguish "continuous" (without interruption for that type) vs. "continual" (repeatedly)
2. **Tacking**: Allowed despite deed to wrong lot
   - Traditional privity: deed changing hands
   - Purpose of privity: screen out trespassers and squatters
   - Kuntas weren't wrongdoers—paid money, deed mistake
   - Privity satisfied by "reasonable connection" that elevates claim above trespasser status

**Takeaway**: Adverse possession can fix deed mistakes; nature of property determines what satisfies elements

---

### *Carpenter v. Ruperto* (Iowa 1982) [CB 169]

**Facts**: Adverse possessor knew lot immediately north wasn't hers (true owner stored junk there). She claimed concern about rats/safety risks to children, so she "improved" it (graded, planted grass, installed propane tank).

**Holding**: No adverse possession—good faith required, possessor loses

**Reasoning**: Iowa requires good faith. Possessor KNEW property wasn't hers. "To allow a squatter to get ownership is to put a premium on dishonesty."

**Professor's skepticism**: If really worried about rats, could've brought nuisance action (would require neighbor to remove junk, but wouldn't allow possessor to install propane tank). Real motivation = wanted spot for propane tank.

**Significance**: Outlier case—most jurisdictions don't explicitly require good faith (Connecticut rule). But empirical evidence suggests judges care about good faith even when law doesn't require it (Richard Helmholtz study).

---

## 5. Terminology & Concepts

**Real Property**: Land and things attached to land (dirt, buildings, trees attached to land)
- NOT "real" as in "real vs. fake"

**Personal Property / Tangible Personal Property**: Things like pencils, water bottles, laptops, hats
- **Old-fashioned terms**: "chattels" (most old-fashioned), "movables" (less common)
- **Modern term**: "personal property" (most popular in class poll)
- **Problem**: Personal property includes intangibles (bank accounts, investments)
- **Solution**: "Tangible personal property" (but many syllables)
- Professor polled class; most preferred "personal property"

**Generic Names in Property Law**:
- Parcels: **Black Acre** (first), then Green Acre, White Acre, Red Acre, Blue Acre, etc.
- Countries (international law): **Ruritania** (from ~1900 *Pirates of Penzance*); also "Erawan" (nowhere backwards)

**Improved vs. Unimproved Property**:
- **Improved**: Deliberately enhanced (house, garden, etc.). *Monopoly* example: houses/hotels on property
- **Unimproved**: Raw land, nothing done to it

**Converter**: Wrongdoer who takes property (from sequential possession cases last class)

**Adjectival Requirements**: The six elements of adverse possession (adjectives modifying "possession")

**Color of Title**: Formal document (deed, judgment) purporting to give title, but defective

**Privity**: Legally relevant relationship (meaning varies by context)
- In adverse possession: relationship between successive possessors that allows tacking

**Disability** (adverse possession): Condition that tolls statute of limitations (infancy, coma, mental incapacity)

**Tolling**: Suspending running of statute of limitations

**Evince**: Give evidence of, show, demonstrate (objective, not subjective)

**Constructive Notice**: You didn't actually know, but law treats you as if you did (vs. actual notice)

**Tenant at Sufferance**: Tenant who stays over after lease ends; deemed there with permission, so not adverse (preview for leases unit)

---

## 6. Professor's Pedagogical/Philosophical Points

1. **Read critically—don't mindlessly copy**: Traced "unfurl his flag" quote through cases to 1887, found corrupted version ("and if he will") has been mindlessly repeated since 1987 treatise. "Do not automatically trust what treatises say. They may get things wrong...If you don't understand something, figure it out." Same problem with AI hallucinations—not unique to AI. #EXAM_SIGNAL

2. **Attention to detail matters**: "Glitch by somebody somewhere" caused deed mistakes in *Howard v. Kunta*. "You're messing up the law" if you don't pay attention.

3. **Diagram sentences**: Asked who had to diagram sentences in school; said it's "really good way of learning grammar" (and useful for statutory interpretation—"future tax lawyers")

4. **Legal terminology vs. ordinary language**: Push every few decades to make law comprehensible, but precision requires technical terms. "Ordinary language kind of falls apart when you try to make things precise."

5. **Most property disputes settled informally**: "Most property disputes in the world are just settled by people working things out...extremely unusual" for cases to go to court/appeals. Law should not be structured to discourage informal resolution.

6. **Nature of property matters**: Repeatedly emphasized law should differ based on characteristics of thing. "Property is the law of things."

7. **Try to make rules make sense**: Disabilities rule seems "utterly crazy"—when something seems crazy, "the better way of dealing with it is try to make it make sense. Try really, really hard...and if you can't, then ask: Why is it that the rule was made in the first place? What went wrong?"

8. **Context matters**: New York housing law is "world unto its own"—common law rules don't translate. Multiple students brought up NYC squatters' rights experiences; professor noted those involve statutes/regulations, not common law adverse possession.

---

## 7. Policy Debates & Justifications

Professor asked class to vote: Who thinks adverse possession makes sense? Who thinks it's kooky/crazy/bizarre?

### **Arguments FOR Adverse Possession**:

1. **Fixes mistakes** (*Howard v. Kunta*): Solves deed errors, aligns legal title with actual possession
2. **Title clearing / "deed in the attic" problem**: Don't want someone showing up decades later claiming ownership based on 1928 deed. Recording acts help, but adverse possession provides cutoff.
3. **Evidentiary staleness**: Finding facts about what happened 30+ years ago "lost in mists of time"—efficiency justification for statutes of limitations
4. **Reliance interests**: People rely on possession over time, become psychologically attached. Oliver Wendell Holmes: people might "get violent" if you take away property they've held long-term.
5. **Helps vulnerable populations**: Student noted NYC squatters' rights (30-day rule) helped low-income/disabled tenants avoid immediate eviction (but professor noted NY housing law is sui generis)

### **Arguments AGAINST Adverse Possession**:

1. **Burdens true owners**: Must routinely monitor property, bring lawsuits, pay lawyers to protect against losing property—burden on elderly, sick, resource-poor owners
2. **Disadvantages vulnerable populations**: Student example—family with farmland but limited liquid assets; grandparents can't survey all acreage; mega-farms/corporations can mark boundaries and take over. Another student: family has property as only asset, worried about tenants staying beyond lease.
3. **"Puts a premium on dishonesty"** (*Carpenter v. Ruperto*): Rewards trespassers and squatters
4. **Seems unfair**: Surgical assistants freaked out by doctrine—"their minds were blown that adverse possession was actually a thing." NY changed law to good faith requirement in 2008 after front-page *New York Times* coverage.

### **Professor's Take**: 

"The Uneasy Case for Adverse Possession" (famous paper)—"most people's attitude...well, you know, the doctrine has some uses, but also has some real question marks on it."

---

## 8. Hypotheticals & Examples

### **Black Acre (50 acres, 2 acres improved)**:
- Parcel is 50 acres
- Adverse possessor fences 2 acres, plants grass, builds house, installs pool
- **Without color of title**: Actual possession of only 2 acres (not 50)
- **With color of title (NY)**: Actual possession of 2 acres → ownership of all 50 acres

### **Disabilities timing hypo (professor's example)**:
- Statutory period = 10 years
- True owner is diligent, checks property every Friday
- Sunday: Adverse possession begins
- Monday: True owner goes into coma
- **Result**: Coma has NO EFFECT on statute (started after adverse possession began)
- 15 years later: True owner wakes up from coma
- "Good news: you're no longer in a coma. Bad news: you've been out 15 years, and adverse possession started 18 hours before you went into coma, so you've lost your farm."
- Professor: "That just seems weird to me."

### **Professor's parents' driveway**:
- Neighbors did survey, found property line different than thought
- Neighbors erected fence encroaching on parents' driveway  
- Parents probably had valid adverse possession claim (decades of possession)
- Didn't bring it because: (1) too old, too burdensome; (2) thought it was "unneighborly"
- Lesson: Most disputes settled informally; doctrine shouldn't discourage that

### **Carpenter propane tank**:
- If really worried about rats: could bring nuisance action → neighbor must remove junk
- But nuisance wouldn't let her install propane tank on neighbor's land
- Adverse possession would give her ownership → could install tank
- Court saw through claimed motivation

---

## 9. Connections & Foreshadowing

- **Nuisance** (future topic): Alternative remedy for *Carpenter*—could've forced neighbor to remove junk, but wouldn't allow propane tank installation
- **Leases** (future topic): Tenant at sufferance (staying over after lease ends) = deemed there with permission → not adverse. NY housing law is "world unto its own" (many statutes/regulations beyond common law).
- **Sequential possession** (last class): *Armory v. Delamere*, *Clark v. Maloney*, *Anderson v. Goldberg*—relativity of title, first possessor wins (but adverse possession trumps even true owner after statutory period)
- **Next class**: "Body parts and ownership thereof"

---

## 10. Questions to Consider / Unresolved Issues

1. Why must disability exist at START of adverse possession to toll statute? "Utterly crazy...I don't have the faintest idea." Try to make it make sense OR explain why rule exists despite making no sense.

2. Do judges actually care about good faith even when law doesn't require it? Empirical evidence (Helmholtz) suggests yes. Is this proper judicial role?

3. Should adverse possession doctrine differ for different types of true owners (elderly, sick, resource-poor) or different types of property (farmland vs. urban)? Or should bright-line rule apply regardless?

4. How does adverse possession interact with modern recording systems? Does recording solve the "deed in the attic" problem better than adverse possession?

5. Is "continuous" the right term if it doesn't mean 24/7? Should doctrine use "continual" or some other term to avoid confusion?

6. What's the difference between adverse possession and prescription (foreshadowed by easements discussions)?

---

## 11. Study Tips / Exam Preparation

✅ **Memorize the 6 elements cold** (professor said explicitly this is "stuff you'll like...straightforward things to memorize for exam, bar")

✅ **Know terminology precisely**:
   - "Adverse/hostile" = contrary to legal rights (NOT ill will)
   - "Continuous" = uninterrupted for THAT TYPE of property (NOT 24/7)
   - "Open and notorious" = visible + understood as property claim
   - "Actual" = physically possessing (can be less than whole parcel)
   - "Exclusive" = OBJECTIVE test (conduct shows sole owner dominion)

✅ **Three claim-of-right approaches**: Good faith (rare but NY), bad faith (Maine rule, defunct), state of mind irrelevant (most common)

✅ **Tacking + privity**: Know traditional rule (deed changing hands) AND modern purpose-based approach (screen out trespassers)

✅ **Color of title**: Know it can extend actual possession of part to whole parcel (NY rule)

✅ **Disabilities**: Must exist when adverse possession STARTS (not later)

✅ **Nature of property matters**: Vacation home ≠ farmland ≠ urban lot ≠ wilderness—affects what satisfies elements

✅ **Policy arguments**: Be able to articulate both sides (fixes mistakes vs. burdens owners; reliance interests vs. rewards dishonesty)

✅ **Spot permission issues**: Tenant/lessee = not adverse (has permission). No adverse possession by renters.

## 12. Personal/Administrative Notes

- Professor has cold, voice issues, nursing voice, apologized for inability to project
- Multiple students left during break (professor joked about "seeking more temperate climes")
- Visiting prospective law students will sit in on future classes
- Room very warm (2° outside, 200° inside)
- Professor asked about practice problems (student question after class—check slides for answers)
- Professor reading "Who Will Take Care of Me When I Get Old" (no spouse/kids, worried about aging)
- Monopoly tangent: almost nobody plays with auction rule (property immediately auctioned if first person doesn't buy)—"interesting lesson about the law"—written rules vs. actual practice

---

**BOTTOM LINE FOR EXAM**: Know all 6 elements cold. Understand "adverse" means "contrary to legal rights" (not hostility). Know continuity depends on nature of property. Know three claim-of-right approaches (and which applies in your jx). Know tacking requires privity (screens out trespassers). Know disabilities rule even though it's "crazy." Be ready to argue policy both ways.
