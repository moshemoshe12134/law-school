# Review — Class #1 — 2026-01-20 — First Possession — Wild Animals and (Intro) Custom

---

## 1. What Professor Emphasized (3-5 main points)

1. Property questions are everywhere; start with ordinary entitlements (seats, lines) and treat them as proto-property disputes. #EXAM_SIGNAL
2. Core baseline questions: what can be owned; how ownership starts; whether rights are transferable; who sets the rule (custom vs official rules vs law). #EXAM_SIGNAL
3. “First in time” is a coordination rule that allocates entitlement in scarce settings (seats, lines, access). #EXAM_SIGNAL
4. The course will return to custom as a rule-source (who decides; what counts as legitimate practice). #EXAM_SIGNAL
5. Logistics: assigned seating; syllabus released in four-week “installments”; no cold calls.

---

## 2. Exam Signals #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Explicit signals:**
- [ ] “All of these issues will show up again throughout the course.” (about ownership, transfer, custom, rule-choice) #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] We will start these questions through *Pierson v. Post* (called out as the first doctrinal anchor). #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Implicit signals:**
- [ ] Exam answers should identify the rule-source problem: is the entitlement grounded in custom, administrative rule, or state law? #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Keep the normative tension in view: time vs money; commodifying priority positions; distributional consequences of “first come, first served.” #EXAM_SIGNAL

---

## 3. Corrections to Prep

**My prep said:** The class would dive quickly into *Pierson v. Post* (pursuit vs capture) and then custom (*Ghen*) as a possible alternative to bright-line capture.
**Prof clarified:** Day 1 was mostly admin plus an extended, concrete “line-standing” vignette to surface the course’s recurring questions before turning to *Pierson* next class.
**Fix:** Treat the “line” hypo as the day-1 doctrinal skeleton: first-in-time, labor, purchase/transfer, and rule-source.

**My prediction:** Early emphasis would be on doctrine parsing (capture standards; custom factors).
**Actually emphasized:** Meta-questions (what should be ownable; how rights arise; who gets to set the rule) using everyday scarcity problems.
**Lesson:** Build an outline front section titled “Property Questions Checklist” and use it in every case.

---

## 4. Doctrinal Insights

**New understanding:**
- Property law starts with allocation mechanisms for scarcity, not with moral desert. “First come, first served” is a default that needs justification.
- Custom is treated as a competing rule-source; the course will repeatedly test when custom should become legally enforceable.

**Statutory/professor moves:**
- Treat entitlement claims as contestable: “Why do you have the right to that seat/spot?” becomes the entry point to formal doctrine.

---

## 5. Policy Arguments

**Strong arguments prof rewarded:**
- Money is more fungible than time; allowing people to “buy” priority positions can amplify inequality even when it’s efficient.
- The rule-maker matters: what feels legitimate as “custom” in one community can look like exploitation in another.

**Strong critiques prof anticipated:**
- Some commodification feels intuitively off even if it’s a voluntary transaction (“line-standing” / selling spots).
- “First in time” rewards resources (ability to wait / refresh / show up early), not merit.

**Exam-ready policy paragraphs:**
- **Coordination vs equity:** Property rules often trade equity for administrability; bright lines reduce conflict but can distribute access regressively.
- **Custom vs law:** Recognizing custom can stabilize expectations among insiders, but it raises notice/fairness problems for outsiders and can entrench power.

## 6. Outline Inserts (copy-ready)

> Paste-ready blocks to add into `05_OUTLINE/` without rewriting.

### Insert: Property Questions Checklist (Use In Every Case)

```markdown
When analyzing any property problem, ask:
1) **What is the “thing”?** (ownable interest; tangible/intangible; rivalrous?)
2) **How does title start?** (first in time; labor; purchase/transfer; custom; law)
3) **What is the rule-source?** (custom vs private rule vs state law)
4) **Is the right transferable?** (sale/assignment; limits on commodification)
5) **What policy tradeoff is being made?** (certainty vs fairness; efficiency vs distribution)

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: “Line” Hypo as First-Possession Warmup

```markdown
Scarce resource (seat/spot in line) → allocate by first-in-time (queue) or by purchase (selling spots) or by labor (standing) or by custom/rules (tickets, reservations).
Key question: should “priority position” be treated as property (alienable) or as non-transferable access?
If it can be sold, more people will join the line for no other purpose than to sell their position. This will increase the cost of the good. But it will also direct access to the party that is willing to pay for it the most. Preventing the sale of the good will limit the value of it as well as inflate the value of one's ability to stand in line (time-value) while limit the ability of time-deficient parties from attaining the good.

## 7. Source Extraction (for SOURCES_TABLE)

> All sources mentioned in this class. Check box when added to `05_OUTLINE/SOURCES_TABLE.md`.

### Cases

| ☐ | Case Name | Rule/Holding | Exam Point | New/Update |
|---|-----------|--------------|------------|------------|
| ☐ | *Pierson v. Post* | Capture vs pursuit (first possession) | First-in-time coordination & administrability | New |

### Statutes/Rules

| ☐ | Citation | Key Provision | Prof's Interpretation |
|---|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| ☐ | (None) | — | — |

### Readings/Scholars

| ☐ | Source | Main Point | Prof's Use |
|---|--------|------------|-----------|
| ☐ | *The Economist* (letter about Rome “sitters” / line-standing) | Longstanding practice of buying priority | Used to surface commodification & legitimacy questions |

## 8. Prewrite Opportunities

> Potential exam questions arising from this lecture. Flag for `06_PREWRITES/`.

### Doctrinal Prewrites Identified

| ☐ | Doctrine | Question Type | Prof's Framework | Priority |
|---|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| ☐ | First possession (Pierson) | Issue-spotter | Coordination vs fairness | High |
| ☐ | Custom as rule-source | Comparative | When custom should bind | High |

### Policy Prewrites Identified

| ☐ | Topic | Question Type | Prof's Angle | Priority |
|---|-------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| ☐ | Commodification (selling spots/priority) | Policy essay | Time vs money; legitimacy of markets | Medium |

### Prewrite Fragment (if ready to extract now)

**Doctrine:** First possession as coordination rule
**Trigger:** Any first-possession dispute (capture/pursuit/custom)
**IRAC Starter:**
> **Issue** Whether [claimant] acquired property rights in [resource] by first possession.
> **Rule** First-possession rules allocate entitlement through public, administrable signals; they often prioritize certainty over individualized fairness.
> **Application template** Identify the “signal” the rule requires; explain why the rule chooses a bright line; address equity/efficiency objections and any competing custom.

## 9. Transcript QC

> Flag any transcript accuracy issues for correction.

**Verification status:** ⚠️ Issues Found

### Errors Detected

| Flag | Section | Issue | Suggested Correction |
|------|---------|-------|---------------------|
| #TRANSCRIPT_VERIFY | Case name | “Pearson against Post” | *Pierson v. Post* |
| #TRANSCRIPT_VERIFY | Shakespeare production | “Kenneth Brenner Macbeth” | Likely Kenneth Branagh (verify) |

**Common legal term corrections applied:**
- “line standards” → likely “line standers” (people paid to hold places in line)

---

## 10. Spaced Reinforcement (10–15 minutes later)

**Self-quiz prompts (closed-book):**

1. List the five “property questions checklist” prompts from memory.
2. In one sentence: why can “first come, first served” be normatively controversial?
3. Give one argument for and one against treating a spot in line as alienable property.
4. Name three competing “roots” of entitlement (first in time / labor / purchase).
5. State what *Pierson v. Post* is about (high-level) and why it’s a good first case.

## METRICS

**Prediction accuracy:** {metrics.prediction_accuracy} (0=missed, 1=partial, 2=accurate)
**Time spent:** {metrics.time_spent_minutes} minutes
**Exam signals found:** {metrics.signal_count}
**Sources extracted:** {metrics.sources_count}
**Prewrite opportunities:** {metrics.prewrite_count}

**What to prep differently next time:**
- Expect admin-heavy first days; keep one “intro hypo” (like the line) ready to map onto upcoming doctrine.
- Build case briefs around rule-source and transferability, not just holdings.
