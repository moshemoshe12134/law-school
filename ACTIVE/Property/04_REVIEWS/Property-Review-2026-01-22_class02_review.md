# Review — Class #2 — 2026-01-22 — First Possession (Pierson v. Post) and Custom (Ghen v. Rich)

---

## 1. What Professor Emphasized (3-5 main points)

1. **First possession is the baseline rule for wild animals, but what constitutes "possession" is contested.** The entire Pierson dispute turns on whether pursuit + mortal wounding + continued pursuit = possession, or whether actual capture is required. #EXAM_SIGNAL

2. **Property rules reflect instrumental trade-offs between certainty and incentives.** Tompkins (majority) prioritizes certainty to avoid disputes; Livingston (dissent) prioritizes incentives for productive labor. Neither focuses on fairness—both are purely instrumental. #EXAM_SIGNAL

3. **Custom can override common law when certain conditions are met.** Ghen establishes that custom governs when: (1) longstanding/universal, (2) practically necessary for the industry, (3) industry-sustaining, (4) reasonable, and (5) limited in scope. #EXAM_SIGNAL

4. **The "who decides" question matters as much as the substantive rule.** Livingston argues for "tribunals of sportsmen" rather than courts. Institutional choice is critical: who is best situated to determine rules—courts, legislatures, agencies, or custom/practice? #EXAM_SIGNAL

5. **American law defaults to all-or-nothing solutions.** Property disputes produce binary winners (Pearson owns the fox OR Post does), not shared ownership or unjust enrichment remedies. This creates harsh results but avoids litigation over contribution percentages. #EXAM_SIGNAL

---

## 2. Exam Signals #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Explicit signals:**
- [ ] "This is property as an institution. It's artificial. We make it up. So what should the rules be here?" (Professor inviting policy analysis of first possession rules) #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] "You presumably had some intuition as you're reading the story [about who should win]" — signal that exam will ask you to argue both sides and identify competing values #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] "How do we figure out what it is that's actually...filling the details" — custom as gap-filler even under common law rules #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] "Property disputes often are disputes between neighbors...law of neighbors" (distinguished from torts/contracts/crimes as law of strangers) — recurring theme #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] "It's worth keeping in mind when you read cases...what actually is the story going on in the case and what things we're not talking about" (unstated normative issues) #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Implicit signals:**
- [ ] Spent ~40 minutes on Pierson alone, drilling certainty vs. incentive trade-offs — this framework recurs throughout the course #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Repeatedly asked "who should win and why?"—exam will test ability to construct arguments for competing outcomes #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Emphasized that Pierson and Ghen reach opposite results (latecomer wins/loses) but may be reconcilable — testing doctrinal synthesis #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Discussed multiple potential problems with custom (information costs, majority dominance, freezing rules, transition uncertainty) — expect custom critique questions #EXAM_SIGNAL

## 3. Corrections to Prep

**My prep said:** Class would cover found property categories (lost/mislaid/abandoned) and water rights (riparian/prior appropriation).
**Prof actually covered:** Pierson v. Post (first possession of wild animals) and Ghen v. Rich (custom as law-source). Found property and water rights were NOT discussed.
**Fix:** The syllabus assignment included CB 64-73 (found property) and 311-325 (water rights), but professor skipped ahead to first possession doctrine. Re-allocate found property prep to the next class that covers Armory/Hannah. Water rights are likely postponed as well.

**My prediction:** Doctrine would focus on capture standards (mortal wounding vs. actual seizure).
**Actually emphasized:** The meta-question of what property rules are FOR (certainty vs. incentives) and who decides (courts vs. custom/tribunals).
**Lesson:** Professor privileges policy reasoning and institutional analysis over mechanical rule application. Outline should foreground the instrumental justifications for each rule.

## 4. Doctrinal Insights

### Pierson v. Post (NY Supreme Court, 1805)

**Key holding (Tompkins majority):**
- Wild animals are owned "by occupancy only" (*ferae naturae* + not owned *ratione soli*).
- **Three-part test for possession**: (1) manifests **unequivocal** intention to appropriate; (2) deprives animal of **natural liberty**; (3) brings within **certain control**.
- **Specific rule for hunters**: Must **mortally wound** the animal AND **not abandon pursuit**.
- Result: Pierson (who killed and carried off) wins. Post (who pursued but didn't mortally wound) loses.

**Key holding (Livingston dissent):**
- Possession should be acquired without manual capture if: (1) pursuer shows intent to convert to own use, AND (2) animal is within reach OR pursuer has **reasonable prospect** of taking it.
- Much easier standard to satisfy; prioritizes incentives for labor over certainty.

**Professor's framing:**
- Tompkins: "For the sake of certainty and preserving peace and order in society" — bright-line rules prevent litigation.
- Livingston: "Who would go to the trouble...if a saucy intruder...were permitted to come in at the death and bear away in triumph the object of pursuit?" — reward labor investment.
- **Neither opinion focuses on fairness/desert.** Both are purely instrumental (social efficiency via different routes).

**New doctrinal point:**
- "Deprivation of natural liberty may justly be deemed to give possession to those who by their industry and labor have used such means of apprehending them" — Tompkins pays lip service to labor theory (probably to preserve voluntary compliance/intuitive plausibility).

### Ghen v. Rich (D. Mass. 1881)

**Rule of Law:**
Industry custom creates property rights when: (1) **longstanding and universal**, (2) **only practical means** of appropriation, (3) **necessary to sustain** the industry, (4) **reasonable**, (5) **limited scope**.

**Holding:**
Whaling company that bomb-lanced finback whale owns it even though Ellis (finder on beach) took physical possession. Custom prevails: killer (identifiable by marked lance) owns whale; finder gets salvage fee.

**Court's reasoning:**
1. Custom is as reasonable as prior whaling customs
2. Limited application (only finback whalers affected)
3. Long acquiescence + works well in practice
4. **Industry-sustaining**: "Unless it be sustained, this branch of industry must necessarily cease"
5. Proper incentives: salvage fee rewards finders for notifying owners

**Professor's framing:**
- Court hedges: "By no means clear that without regard to the usage, the common law would not reach the same result" — avoiding unfairness to losing party.
- But ultimately: "Be that as it may, I hold the usage to be valid" — custom trumps common law here.

**Reconciling Pierson and Ghen:**
- Opposite results (latecomer wins in Pierson, loses in Ghen) are reconcilable.
- Pierson test requires mortal wounding + continued pursuit. Ghen plaintiff mortally wounded whale (bomb-lance) and arguably didn't "abandon pursuit" (waiting for whale to resurface is standard practice).
- **Custom as gap-filler**: Even under Pierson common law test, you need custom to define "abandonment of pursuit" in context-specific ways.

## 5. Policy Arguments

### Strong arguments prof rewarded:

**1. Certainty reduces transaction costs and enables planning**
- Bright-line rules (actual capture) let everyone know ex ante who owns what.
- Vague standards ("reasonable prospect") generate endless litigation + discourage investment because of uncertainty.
- Professor's football analogy: offsides rule (clear) vs. "what is a catch?" (perpetual disputes).

**2. Labor investment deserves protection to incentivize productive activity**
- Post exhausted himself chasing the fox; Pearson free-rode on Post's effort.
- Whaling is dangerous (high mortality); no one would do it if "chance finders" could appropriate the fruits.
- Lockean labor theory: mixing labor with unowned resource creates entitlement.

**3. Custom reflects time-tested practical wisdom**
- "Usage sanctioned by the experience of ages" + "well known to every votary of Diana" (hunters).
- Insiders know the rules; outsiders can ask (lower information costs than consulting Justinian/Blackstone).
- Evolves organically to solve coordination problems in specific industries.

**4. Administrability matters for voluntary compliance**
- Rules that seem intuitively plausible get voluntary compliance (jaywalking counterexample: no one obeyed because rule seemed absurd).
- Courts need legitimacy; handing down crazy-seeming decisions undermines authority.

### Strong critiques prof anticipated:

**1. Labor investment argument cuts both ways**
- Rewarding pursuit incentivizes wasted effort (many pursuers, few captors).
- Rewarding capture incentivizes actual success (patent is not a "hunting license").
- Pearson is a jerk who acted out of spite—but fairness isn't the basis for property allocation.

**2. Custom can be unjust, exclusionary, or frozen**
- **Whose interests does custom protect?** Majorities can oppress minorities; dominant minorities can entrench privilege (Jim Crow customs → Jim Crow laws).
- **Information costs**: Customs vary port-to-port; outsiders don't know the rules (Swift v. Gifford: local port customs shouldn't override general maritime law).
- **Freezing**: Institutionalizing custom via judicial decision prevents evolution (Livingston: "tribunal of sportsmen" would be more adaptive).
- **Transition uncertainty**: How do you know when custom has changed? Old custom vs. new custom disputes.

**3. Binary outcomes are harsh**
- American law loves all-or-nothing solutions (Pearson owns fox; Ghen owns whale). No unjust enrichment / restitution / shared ownership.
- Both Pearson and Post contributed to capturing fox; why not split?
- Answer: administrability. Determining relative contributions is costly/uncertain.

**4. Institutional choice is undertheorized**
- Courts? Legislatures? Agencies? Tribunals of practitioners? Custom?
- Courts may lack expertise in whaling/hunting; sportsmen tribunals better situated.
- But custom may be inaccessible, manipulable, or oppressive.

### Exam-ready policy paragraphs:

**When arguing for bright-line capture rule (Tompkins):**
"A clear rule requiring actual capture (mortal wounding + continued pursuit) promotes certainty and reduces disputes. Parties can know ex ante who owns the resource, enabling planning and investment. Vague standards like 'reasonable prospect of capture' generate costly litigation and undermine voluntary compliance. While this rule may seem harsh to diligent pursuers who fail at the last moment, the trade-off is justified: certainty outweighs perfect allocation of rewards for effort. The alternative—endless fights over contribution percentages—would waste social resources and chill productive activity."

**When arguing for labor-protective standard (Livingston):**
"Property rules should incentivize productive labor by protecting those who invest effort. Post spent energy chasing the fox; Pearson free-rode and acted out of spite. Allowing Pearson to win rewards opportunistic interlopers and discourages honest labor. A 'reasonable prospect' standard better aligns rewards with effort: if Post had the fox nearly within grasp, the law should protect that investment. This is especially critical for dangerous industries like whaling, where no one would risk their life if 'chance finders' could appropriate the fruits of their labor."

**When arguing for custom:**
"Custom should govern when courts lack expertise and insiders have developed time-tested solutions. Whaling customs reflect practical necessity (finback whales sink; immediate capture is impossible) and universal industry practice. Deferring to custom reduces information costs (participants already know the rules) and preserves industry viability. The court should enforce custom when: (1) longstanding/universal, (2) practically necessary, (3) industry-sustaining, (4) reasonable, and (5) limited in scope. Here, all five factors are satisfied."

**When critiquing custom:**
"Custom can entrench unjust power structures and exclude outsiders. Customs reflect the preferences of dominant groups (potentially oppressive majorities or entrenched minorities). Jim Crow customs became Jim Crow laws. Customs vary by locality, creating information costs for outsiders who can't easily discover the rules. Judicially enforcing custom freezes rules in place, preventing adaptive evolution. Finally, courts are poorly equipped to determine what custom IS, especially during transition periods when customs are changing. A tribunal of practitioners or legislative rule-making may be superior."

## 6. Outline Inserts (copy-ready)

### Insert: First Possession of Wild Animals (Pierson v. Post Framework)

```markdown
## First Possession of Wild Animals

**Threshold: When does first possession doctrine apply?**
- Wild animal (*ferae naturae*)
- NOT owned *ratione soli* (not on private land where landowner has constructive possession)
- Rule: Property acquired "by occupancy only" (first possession)

**Tompkins (majority) test — Three elements:**
1. Manifests **unequivocal** intention to appropriate animal to individual use
2. Deprives animal of **natural liberty**
3. Brings animal within **certain control**

**Specific rule for HUNTERS:**
- Must **mortally wound** animal AND **not abandon pursuit**
- Actual physical capture NOT required if both elements satisfied
- Rationale: Certainty ("preserving peace and order in society"); administrability

**Livingston (dissent) test — Two elements:**
1. Pursuer shows intent to convert animal to own use, AND
2. Animal is within reach OR pursuer has **reasonable prospect** of taking it
- Rationale: Incentivize labor ("who would go to the trouble...if a saucy intruder were permitted to come in at the death")

**Policy trade-off:**
- Tompkins: Certainty/administrability/avoiding disputes
- Livingston: Incentivizing productive labor/protecting investment
- Neither focuses on fairness/desert (both purely instrumental)

**Application notes:**
- What counts as "abandonment of pursuit"? May require **custom as gap-filler** (see Ghen v. Rich)
- Binary outcomes: all-or-nothing (no shared ownership or unjust enrichment splitting)
```

### Insert: Custom as Source of Property Law (Ghen v. Rich Framework)

```markdown
## Custom as Source of Property Law

**Rule (Ghen v. Rich):**
Custom creates enforceable property rights when:
1. **Longstanding and universal** within the industry/community
2. **Only practical means** of appropriation (physical capture impractical/impossible)
3. **Necessary to sustain the industry** (without legal enforcement, industry collapses)
4. **Reasonable** (comparable to other recognized customs)
5. **Limited scope** (affects few parties; narrow application)

**Application (Ghen):**
- Finback whaling custom: killer (identified by marked bomb-lance) owns whale even after it sinks and washes ashore
- Finder gets modest salvage fee (incentivizes reporting)
- All five factors satisfied → custom prevails over common law capture rule

**When custom overrides common law:**
- Court hedges: "By no means clear that without regard to the usage, the common law would not reach the same result"
- But ultimately: Custom governs even if it diverges from common law
- Avoids unfairness: parties relied on custom; court won't upset expectations

**Custom as gap-filler:**
- Even under common law rules, custom may be necessary to interpret vague standards
- Example: "Abandonment of pursuit" in Pierson requires industry-specific custom to define

**Institutional choice question (Livingston dissent in Pierson):**
- "Knotty point...should have been submitted to arbitration of sportsmen"
- Courts may lack expertise; tribunals of practitioners better situated
- Custom reflects "usage sanctioned by experience of ages"
```

### Insert: Policy Critiques of Custom

```markdown
## Critiques of Custom as Law-Source

**Information costs:**
- Custom varies by locality/industry; outsiders don't know the rules
- Contrast: law is universal and accessible (in theory)
- Counter: Insiders can be asked; may be cheaper than hiring lawyer to research case law

**Power dynamics:**
- Customs reflect preferences of dominant groups (majority or entrenched minority)
- Risk of oppression: Jim Crow customs → Jim Crow laws
- "Whose interests does custom protect?"

**Freezing rules / preventing evolution:**
- Judicial enforcement locks custom in place
- As circumstances change, custom should evolve—but law prevents adaptation
- Counter: Common law rules are equally frozen unless overruled

**Transition uncertainty:**
- How do you know when custom has changed?
- During transition, unclear whether old or new custom governs
- Generates disputes (defeats certainty rationale)

**Institutional competence:**
- Courts poorly suited to determine what custom IS
- May require expert testimony, empirical investigation
- "Tribunal of sportsmen" or other practitioner bodies may be superior

**When to defer to custom (exam checklist):**
1. Is custom longstanding/universal? Or new/contested?
2. Is it practically necessary? Or just convenient?
3. Is industry viability at stake? Or just distributional preference?
4. Is scope limited? Or broad societal impact?
5. Is custom reasonable/just? Or oppressive/exclusionary?
```

### Insert: Certainty vs. Incentives Trade-off (Recurring Theme)

```markdown
## Certainty vs. Incentives Trade-off

**Fundamental tension in property law:**
- **Certainty**: Clear, bright-line rules enable planning, reduce disputes, lower transaction costs
- **Incentives**: Protecting labor/investment encourages productive activity

**Certainty arguments (Tompkins):**
- Ex ante clarity: parties know who owns what before disputes arise
- Administrability: courts can apply rule mechanically (no vague balancing)
- Voluntary compliance: intuitive rules reduce need for coercive enforcement
- Example: Actual capture = possession (easy to verify)

**Incentive arguments (Livingston):**
- Reward effort/labor: Lockean mixing-labor theory
- Prevent free-riding: Don't let "saucy intruders" appropriate fruits of others' labor
- Industry-sustaining: Dangerous/costly activities (whaling) require protection of investment
- Example: "Reasonable prospect" = possession (protects pursuers who contributed)

**Neither side focuses on fairness/desert:**
- Both are **instrumental** arguments (maximize social welfare)
- Distributional equity is a separate question

**Binary outcomes:**
- American law defaults to all-or-nothing (Pearson owns OR Post owns)
- No shared ownership, unjust enrichment, or contribution-splitting
- Rationale: Administrability (determining contribution percentages is costly/uncertain)

**Exam approach:**
- Identify which value (certainty or incentives) each party emphasizes
- Argue both sides: certainty prevents disputes; incentives encourage productivity
- Note instrumental nature (not about who "deserves" it morally)
```

## 7. Hypos and Professor Questions

### Hypo 1: Two hunters both chase fox; both shoot at same time; both hit simultaneously
**Issue:** Who owns the fox under Tompkins test (mortal wounding + continued pursuit)?
**Analysis:** Both hunters mortally wounded and neither abandoned pursuit. Tompkins test doesn't resolve (overdetermination problem—either cause alone would be sufficient). Possible outcomes: (1) co-ownership (rare), (2) no ownership (both claims fail), (3) case-specific fact inquiry into who shot "first" (defeats certainty rationale). Professor: Administrability concern—vague standards generate these problems. Tompkins test still better than Livingston (where multiple hunters with "reasonable prospect" would constantly conflict).

### Hypo 2: Post chases fox for hours; Pearson steps in 10 feet away and shoots
**Livingston test:** Post wins (has "reasonable prospect" of capture).
**Tompkins test:** Pearson wins (only Pearson mortally wounded).
**Policy:** Is 10 feet "within reach"? Vagueness of Livingston test. But doesn't Pearson's victory reward spite and discourage labor?

### Hypo 3: Whaling custom requires marked lance; company uses unmarked lance
**Issue:** Does custom still apply if company violates custom's internal rules?
**Analysis:** Custom's legitimacy depends on universal compliance. If company deviates, custom may not govern (no reliance interest). But court might apply common law capture rule as fallback.

### Hypo 4: Custom in Port A says X; custom in Port B says Y; whale washes ashore in Port C
**Issue:** Which custom governs? Information cost problem.
**Analysis:** Swift v. Gifford: local port customs shouldn't override general maritime law. Court would likely reject both customs and apply common law. Or court might look to "usage which embraced an entire business" (Ghen).

---

## 8. Exam Themes and Patterns

**Recurring analytical moves:**
1. **Instrumental reasoning**: Don't ask "who deserves X?"—ask "what rule maximizes social welfare?"
2. **Certainty vs. incentives**: Every possession rule trades off between these values. Identify the trade-off explicitly.
3. **Institutional choice**: Who should decide—courts, legislatures, agencies, custom, tribunals?
4. **Custom as gap-filler**: Even under formal legal rules, custom interprets vague terms (e.g., "abandonment").
5. **Binary outcomes**: American law defaults to all-or-nothing; acknowledge harshness but defend administrability.
6. **Unstated normative issues**: What's the story behind the case? (Pierson = social status fight; Ghen = killing sentient creatures?)

**Professor's exam signals:**
- "What should the rules be here?" = pure policy question (argue both sides)
- "Why might that be bad?" = identify trade-offs and critiques
- "How do you know?" = epistemic/information cost problem
- "Who should decide?" = institutional choice question

**Likely exam patterns:**
- Fact pattern with first possession dispute → apply Tompkins vs. Livingston tests → argue both certainty and incentive rationales
- Custom scenario → apply Ghen five-factor test → critique custom (power dynamics, information costs, freezing)
- Institutional choice question: "Should court enforce custom or apply common law?" → weigh expertise, accessibility, legitimacy

---

## 9. Connections to Class 1

**Recurring themes from "line-standing" hypo:**
1. **Allocation mechanisms**: First-in-time (line-standing) = first possession (Pierson). Both are coordination rules for scarce resources.
2. **Rule-source question**: Who decides—custom (Ghen) vs. theater owner (private ordering) vs. law (courts)?
3. **Commodification/transfer**: Should line-standers be able to sell spots? Should hunters be able to sell foxes? Separating possession from use.
4. **Coordination vs. equity**: Bright-line rules (first-in-time; actual capture) sacrifice distributional fairness for administrability.

**Evolution:**
- Class 1: Concrete hypo to surface recurring questions (what's ownable? how acquired? transferable? who decides?)
- Class 2: Doctrinal application (first possession as default; custom as alternative rule-source)

## 10. Open Questions / Things to Watch

- [ ] When will we cover found property (Armory/Hannah)? Skipped this class but in syllabus reading.
- [ ] Water rights (riparian/prior appropriation) also skipped—when does that appear?
- [ ] How does *ratione soli* (landowner owns wild animals on land) interact with first possession? Boundary cases?
- [ ] Will "tribunal of sportsmen" institutional choice question recur? Livingston's dissent seems important.
- [ ] Unjust enrichment/restitution mentioned but "you don't get exposed to it nearly enough"—will this return?
- [ ] "Bonus unit toward the end" that professor has "never taught before"—what is it?

*End of Class 2 Review*
