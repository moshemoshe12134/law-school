# Review — Class #3 — 2026-01-27 — Tragedy of the Commons & Water Rights

---

## 1. What Professor Emphasized (3-5 main points)

1. **Tragedy of the Commons demonstrates the core property problem: externalities from competing resource use.** Individual ranchers internalize benefits from grazing but externalize costs (overgrazing), leading to resource depletion. Property rules are institutional solutions to coordinate conflicting uses. #EXAM_SIGNAL

2. **Property = an institution, not a natural fact.** All property regimes (common ownership, private property, markets, insurance, mob rule enforcement) are human constructs with trade-offs. None is definitively better—each has costs (enforcement, transaction costs, inequity) and benefits (resource utilization/preservation). #EXAM_SIGNAL

3. **Hayek's knowledge problem: Central planners cannot aggregate dispersed information.** Even with perfect incentives (Microsoft trying to predict iPhone), decision-makers lack the local/tacit knowledge to make optimal choices. This justifies markets and private property over centralized allocation. #EXAM_SIGNAL

4. **Anti-commons (Michael Heller): Too many veto rights causes under-utilization.** Contrast with tragedy of commons (over-utilization). When multiple parties have ownership/veto power, holdouts prevent productive use. American property law's bias toward resource utilization disfavors anti-commons. #EXAM_SIGNAL

5. **Water rights doctrines trade off certainty vs. flexibility.** Natural flow rule (egalitarian, inflexible, high transaction costs) vs. reasonable use rule (contextual, uncertain, reduces holdouts). First appropriation (certainty, rewards early users) vs. reasonable use (adapts to changing needs). #EXAM_SIGNAL

---

## 2. Exam Signals #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Explicit signals:**
- [ ] "Property = an institution. We make it up." — Exam will test ability to critique and design property rules based on policy goals #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] "Common ownership vs private plus markets and insurance—none are definitely better than other." — Expect questions asking to compare institutional alternatives #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] "American property law favors resource utilization." — Recurring principle that explains case outcomes (Evans, Coffin, etc.) #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Implicit signals:**
- [ ] Spent significant time on tragedy of commons + institutional solutions — framework for analyzing any shared resource problem (groundwater, fisheries, spectrum, etc.) #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Repeatedly emphasized "internalize costs/benefits" — key diagnostic for evaluating property rules #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Discussed multiple water doctrines (natural flow, reasonable use, first appropriation) — expect fact patterns requiring choice among competing rules #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Noted "reasonable changes over time" and "not always obvious who was there first" — uncertainty costs are central to property doctrine design #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Mentioned holdout problem in water rights — connects to broader themes (anti-commons, eminent domain, servitudes) #EXAM_SIGNAL

## 3. Corrections to Prep

**Expected coverage:** (Based on prior class patterns, likely expected more case analysis)
**Actually covered:** Heavy emphasis on theoretical frameworks (tragedy of commons, knowledge problem, anti-commons) before diving into water rights cases. Professor teaching at higher level of abstraction.
**Lesson:** Prep should include economic/philosophical foundations for property rules, not just case holdings.

## 4. Doctrinal Insights

### Tragedy of the Commons (Framework)

**Problem Structure:**
- Actors maximize individual benefit but ignore external costs
- Example: Ranchers on common pasture
  - Each rancher benefits from adding more cattle (private benefit)
  - But overgrazing harms all ranchers (external cost)
  - Result: Rational individual behavior → collective irrationality

**Why refraining doesn't work:**
- Rancher who refrains from overgrazing bears full cost (foregone income)
- But benefit (grass preservation) is shared by all → "losing proposition"
- Planting more grass: High private cost, public benefit → also losing
- **Core insight:** Parties cannot internalize benefits from restraint in common ownership regime

**Institutional Solutions & Trade-offs:**

1. **Private Property**
   - **Mechanism:** Assign exclusive rights; rancher competes against nature, not neighbors
   - **Benefits:** Internalizes costs/benefits; incentivizes productive investment
   - **Costs:** Requires fences, enforcement against outsiders; creates risk from localized shocks (drought on one plot while neighbor has surplus)

2. **Markets** (to fix private property defects)
   - **Mechanism:** Allow trading of excess resources (grass, water rights)
   - **Benefits:** Reallocates to highest-value use
   - **Costs:** Transaction costs; requires enforcement infrastructure

3. **Insurance** (to fix private property defects)
   - **Mechanism:** Pool risk; fund pays out to those harmed by drought/shortage
   - **Benefits:** Spreads risk; reduces waste
   - **Costs:** Administration, moral hazard, adverse selection

4. **Mob Rule / Self-Enforcement**
   - **Mechanism:** Participants enforce rules against violators (cf. Ghen v. Rich custom)
   - **Benefits:** Lower enforcement costs (no state police needed)
   - **Costs:** Risk of vigilantism, unequal power dynamics, majority oppression

**Key Takeaway:** "Common ownership vs private plus markets and insurance—none are definitely better than other." Policy analysis requires comparing institutional costs.

### Hayek's Knowledge Problem

**Source:** F.A. Hayek, *The Use of Knowledge in Society*

**Central claim:** Dispersed, local, tacit knowledge cannot be aggregated by central planners.

**Class example: Microsoft & iPhone**
- Bill Gates (paranoid about extinction, perfect incentive to predict future)
- Steve Ballmer (April 2007): "There is no chance iPhone will get any amount of market share"
- **Lesson:** Even with unlimited resources and motivation, centralized decision-makers lack information to optimize

**Implication for property:** Markets + private ownership leverage dispersed knowledge better than central allocation (zoning boards, regulators, etc.). Signals (prices, bids) aggregate information.

---

### Anti-Commons (Michael Heller)

**Definition:** Too many parties with veto rights → resource under-utilization

**Contrast:**
- Tragedy of commons: Too few gatekeepers → over-use
- Anti-commons: Too many gatekeepers → under-use

**Examples:**
- Land with fragmented ownership → no development (each owner can hold out)
- Patent thickets → technology under-deployed
- Broadcast spectrum with competing licenses → "white spaces" go unused

**American property law response:** Doctrines favor utilization (adverse possession, marketable title acts, eminent domain) to prevent anti-commons.

---

### Water Rights Doctrines

#### Terminology
- **Defined channel:** Stream, river (flows in predictable path) → resource to be allocated
- **Diffuse water:** Floodwater, runoff (unpredictable) → pest to be eradicated (different legal regime)
- **Riparian:** Owner of land adjacent to stream/river
- **Littoral:** Owner of land adjacent to lake/pond
- **Appurtenant:** (Note: Incomplete in class notes—likely refers to water rights that "run with the land")

---

### Evans v. Merriweather (1842)

**Citation:** Supreme Court of Illinois, 1842 (CB p. 312)

**Facts:**
- Smith & Baker (S&B) buy land on stream, build steam mill (uses water by boiling it for steam power)
- S&B's mill pipes water from stream
- Later: Evans buys land **upstream** on same stream, builds steam mill
- Then: S&B sell their land/mill to Merriweather
- Drought hits → not enough water for both mills
- Evans builds **dam** to divert all water to his mill (doesn't flow downstream to Merriweather)
- Merriweather sues

**Professor's diagram:** Drew identical fact patterns on board—Evans v. Merriweather (dam not allowed) vs. Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch (dam allowed). Same pictures, opposite outcomes. Geographic context determines which rule applies.

**Natural Flow Rule (English rule, rejected):**
- **Rule:** Riparians may use water only if it does not interrupt natural flow to downstream users
- **Rationale:** Equality among riparians; preserves natural state; egalitarian principle ("everybody gets the same")
- **English law tradition:** American courts in 19th century followed English common law extensively post-1776
- **Problem #1:** High transaction costs (must negotiate with all downstream users)
- **Problem #2:** Assembly problem—need permissions from many parties (A must get permission from B, C, D... downstream)
- **Problem #3:** Strategic holdout problem:
  - Downstream owner sees upstream factory project worth $1M
  - Water rights worth $1,000 to downstream owner personally
  - But can demand $500,000 because holds veto power
  - Result: Valuable projects may not happen; water flows unused into bay
- **Result under natural flow:** Water may go unused (paradoxically conflicts with American law's bias toward utilization)
- **Court rejects this for U.S.:** "Not productive enough. Too constraining economically."

**Application to Evans—First Possession Ambiguity:**
- **Who is "first possessor"?** (Not obvious)
  - **Evans argument:** First to possess *these particular water molecules* (H₂O molecules flowing downstream—each molecule is separate thing, like separate foxes)
  - **S & B argument:** First to use the stream generally
  - **Merriweather argument:** "Steps into the shoes" of S&B; purchased S&B's first-in-time right
- **Professor's point:** First possession doesn't solve the problem—must choose a different principle

**Reasonable Use Rule (Evans holding):**
- **Two-part test:** Riparian may use water if:
  1. Use is **reasonable**, AND
  2. Use does not take **more water than necessary** to accomplish the reasonable use
- **Both must be satisfied**—even reasonable use fails if you take 2x what you need

**Defining Reasonable = Natural vs. Artificial Wants:**

**Natural wants:**
- "Absolutely necessary" uses
- Personal use that cannot be fulfilled otherwise (drinking, cooking, household)
- **Context-dependent:** Water for irrigation:
  - In **Egypt** (arid): Irrigation = **natural want** (Nile-dependent civilization)
  - In **rainforest**: Irrigation = **artificial want** (already have water)
- Natural wants **ALWAYS** trump artificial wants #EXAM_SIGNAL
- Upstream user with natural want can use **100% of water** if downstream uses are all artificial

**Artificial wants:**
- "Merely increase comfort and prosperity"
- Commercial/profit-seeking use (steam mills, factories)
- NOT unreasonable per se, but subordinate to natural wants

**When artificial wants clash (as in Evans):**
- **Rule:** Quote: "Neither has the right to use all the water; all have the right to participate in its benefits"
- **Key limit:** Artificial use may **NEVER** consume **ALL** the water #EXAM_SIGNAL
- **Standard:** Jury decides whether user took "more than his just proportion"
- No universal rule—must be determined case-by-case by jury
- Here: Evans used **all** the water → automatic violation → Merriweather wins

**Restatement (Second) of Torts § 850A (p. 316):**
- Multi-factor reasonableness test ("everything they could think of"):
  - Purpose, suitability to watercourse, economic/social values
  - Harm caused, accommodation techniques possible
  - Protection of existing investments
  - Ability of affected riparians to bear loss
  - Justice (!)
- **Professor's reaction:** Not much illumination beyond common sense

**Trade-offs:**
- **Benefit:** Reduces holdouts; allows productive uses; promotes "socially valuable uses"
- **Cost:** Uncertainty (what's "reasonable"? decided by judge/jury)
  - Varies judge to judge, jury to jury
  - "Reasonable" changes over time (parenting example—what was OK in 1980s would be "insane" today)
  - Investment deterred by uncertainty
- **Government decides value:** Court determines what is "socially valuable" use

### Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Company (1882)

**Citation:** Supreme Court of Colorado, 1882 (CB p. 317)

**Facts:**
- Left Hand Ditch Company (upstream) diverts water from stream for irrigation using **dam**
- Dam captures some water but allows rest to spill over downstream
- Later: Coffin acquires land **downstream**, also uses water for irrigation
- 1879: Drought → not enough water for both users
- Coffin **breaches the dam** to get more water flow
- Left Hand Ditch sues

**Professor's Key Point:** "These two diagrams [Evans and Coffin] are identical. Same picture. But in [Evans], dam not allowed. In [Coffin], dam, thumbs up. What's up with that?" #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Holding:** Colorado adopts **first appropriation approach**, not reasonable use/riparian rule

**Rationale—Geographic Context:**
- Quote: "The climate is dry and the soil, when moistened only by the usual rainfall, is arid and unproductive, except in a few favored sections. Artificial irrigation for agriculture is an absolute necessity. Water in the various streams thus acquires a value unknown in moister climates."
- **Sounds similar to Evans** (irrigation as "natural want" in dry areas) but **opposite result**
- **Public policy in Colorado:** Encouraged diversion/use of water for agriculture since earliest settlement

**Reliance Interests:**
- "Houses have been built and permanent improvements made. The soil has been cultivated and thousands of acres have been rendered immensely valuable with the understanding that appropriations of water would be protected."
- Changing rule now would destroy property values → need **certainty**
- **Echoes Pierson v. Post:** Majority prioritized certainty to enable planning/investment

**First Appropriation Rule—Three Elements:**
1. **First appropriator** of water from natural stream
2. **For a beneficial purpose**
3. **Prior right to the extent of such appropriation** (limited to amount first taken)

**Element 1: First Appropriator**
- Temporal priority
- Here: Left Hand Ditch was first to appropriate
- Note: Still has ambiguity problem (who's "first" to particular water molecules?)

**Element 2: Beneficial Purpose**
- Diverting water to arid land for agriculture = beneficial
- **What's NOT beneficial:** Using water to "shoo gophers away" (casebook note)
  - Professor's reaction: "Not very beneficial"
  - Courts police boundaries—trivial/wasteful uses don't qualify
- Even riparians don't have absolute rights to waste water (connects to utilization bias)

**Element 3: Limited to Extent of First Appropriation**
- If you initially appropriate 100 gallons/day, you get 100 gallons/day
- **Cannot expand later** to 100,000 gallons/day if that interferes with downstream users
- Even if expanded use is also beneficial, you're limited to your original appropriation
- Downstream users who came later may have superior rights to the "new" 99,900 gallons

**Trade-offs:**
- **Benefits:**
  - **Certainty:** Identity of "first" doesn't change over time (no time machines)
  - **Concrete/bright-line:** Less variation judge-to-judge than "reasonable"
  - **Rewards initiative:** Promotes economic development
  - **Stable:** What's first in 1880 is still first in 2026
- **Costs:**
  - May not always be obvious who is first (same problems as Pierson v. Post)
  - No requirement that use be "reasonable" or efficient
  - Could lead to water misuse/waste

**Geographic Rule:**
- **Western/Southwestern states (dry):** First appropriation (CO, CA, etc.)
- **Everywhere else (Eastern states):** Reasonable use/riparian rule
- "Check your jurisdiction" for which rule applies

**Connection to American Property Law Bias:**
- Both Evans and Coffin reject natural flow because it prevents productive use
- American law "favors putting resources to productive use" (historical: "vast natural resources, let's use them")
- But different solutions (reasonable use vs. first appropriation) based on local conditions

## 5. Class Notes Integration

**From student notes (jan 27.md):**

Key themes that emerged:
- Tragedy of commons framework applied to grazing (not just theoretical)
- Hayek's knowledge problem (central planning failures) as justification for property
- Anti-commons as mirror image problem
- Water law: Natural flow vs. reasonable use vs. first appropriation
- "Artificial wants" may not justify unlimited water use (Evans holding)

**Notable quotes/emphases:**
- "Party chooses option that benefits themselves (internal) but not external effects"
- "Ranchers cannot internalize the benefits from refraining from over-grazing"
- "Private property: benefits and costs are internalized"
- "None are definitely better than other" (re: property institutions)
- **"If artificial want, it's never okay to use all the water. (important)"** #EXAM_SIGNAL

## 6. Professor's Vivid Examples & Teaching Moments

**Free Pizza Problem (Tragedy of Commons in Action):**
- Student events with free pizza
- Arrive 15 min late → no pizza left
- People grab multiple slices, "two paper plate stack" trick
- Professor saw someone walking out with **two entire boxes** ("it said free, didn't say a limit")
- Same structure as tragedy of commons: no benefit to forbearance, rational to take maximum
- "This has been noted" → recurring pattern everywhere

**Microsoft & iPhone Story (Knowledge Problem):**
- Bill Gates: "paranoid" Microsoft would go extinct (knew DEC/Honeywell/Route 128 companies wiped out by PC revolution)
- Microsoft: Most valuable company by 2000, all resources, best engineers, stock options
- **January 2007:** Steve Jobs reveals iPhone (just "freaking glass," no buttons)
- Android project lead (Google): "We have to scrap everything and start from scratch"
- **April 2007:** Steve Ballmer (Microsoft CEO): "There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance."
- Years later: Ballmer fired, Microsoft phone failed
- **Lesson:** Even with unlimited resources/incentives, central planner cannot aggregate dispersed information to make optimal decisions
- **Professor's point:** This is a "$1 trillion question" that Microsoft boots badly

**Doctor's Office Line (Distributive Justice Hypo):**
- Professor arrived on time but waited 1 hour (people ahead showed up late due to weather)
- Options to reallocate:
  1. First-come-first-served (actual arrival) → punishes on-time people
  2. Put latecomers at end of day → they wait 6-8 hours
  3. Interleave (one on-time, one late, alternating)
- "I don't know the answer... everything in life gives you an opportunity to think about institutional design"
- Same problem structure as water rights allocation

**Somali Piracy & Overfishing (Modern Tragedy of Commons):**
- 10-15 years ago: Somalia pirates
- **Origin:** Locals protecting fishing grounds from ships "from completely other parts of the world... slurping up their fish"
- Fancy fishing ships: "Giant vacuum cleaners," process fish on board, "travel to the other side of the globe"
- Result: Overfishing, no parent fish → no baby fish
- IUU fishing: Illegal, Unreported, Unregulated
- "Later turned into something very different... until Tom Hanks went and solved it apparently" (Captain Phillips reference)

**Pollution as Reverse Tragedy of Commons:**
- Factory smoke: Wind blows it away → external cost, don't care
- Chemicals dumped in rivers
- Anthropogenic global warming: Carbon dioxide → nobody internalizes costs
- Vacant city lot fills with trash
- **Professor:** "You can get pollution... just going in the other direction"

**1928 Film "The Crowd" (Changing Standards):**
- King Vidor silent film
- Kid left alone running around city: "Of course that's what you do"
- Even when professor was kid: Deemed "extremely weird"
- Today: "They'd probably be throwing [mom] in jail"
- **Point:** What's "reasonable" changes drastically over time

## 7. Connections to Prior Classes

**Pierson v. Post (Class 2):**
- Certainty vs. incentives trade-off → echoed in natural flow (certain) vs. reasonable use (flexible)
- First possession → parallels first appropriation for water rights
- Instrumental reasoning (not fairness) → same approach to water rights

**Ghen v. Rich (Class 2):**
- Custom as alternative to formal law → "mob rule" enforcement in commons discussion
- Industry-sustaining rules → reasonable use allows commercial agriculture (productive use)

---

## 7. Prewrite Opportunities

**None explicitly flagged yet—awaiting more doctrinal detail on water rights cases.**

Potential topics:
- Compare tragedy of commons vs. anti-commons
- Evaluate institutional alternatives for resource management
- Apply reasonable use rule to hypothetical water dispute

---

## 8. Open Questions / Follow-Up

- [ ] What is "appurtenant" in water rights context? (Note incomplete in class notes)
- [ ] Full holding of Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch—was this prior appropriation case?
- [ ] How does first appropriation differ from reasonable use? (Only mentioned briefly)
- [ ] Does "natural wants always trump artificial wants" apply to all property contexts or just water?

---

## 9. Study Tips

- **Tragedy of commons will recur:** Any shared resource problem (oil/gas, groundwater, fisheries, air rights) invokes this framework. Be ready to analyze institutional alternatives.
- **"Internalize costs/benefits" is diagnostic test:** Whenever evaluating a property rule, ask: Does this rule cause actors to bear the consequences of their choices?
- **Reasonable use uncertainty:** Professor flagged this as a problem. On exam, argue both sides: (1) flexibility allows adaptation vs. (2) unpredictability chills investment.
- **American law favors utilization:** If stuck between two rules, bet on the one that allows more productive use (but be able to critique this bias).

---

## 10. Next Class Prep

- Likely to continue water rights (prior appropriation doctrine, more cases)
- Or pivot to found property (Armory, Hannah) if catching up to syllabus
- Review Coffin holding in detail (casebook note)
