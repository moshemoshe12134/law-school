## 1. PREP VS. REALITY COMPARISON

| **Prep Focus** | **Class Discussion Reality** | **Verdict** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Continuous Trespass / Encroachment** | Covered in *Pile v. Pedrick* toward the end. Introduced the "absolutist" rule for encroachments. | **Aligned** |
| **Ex Ante / Ex Post Theory** | Not explicitly labeled as such in the transcript portion reviewed, but implicit in the discussion of efficiency (e.g., *Hinman* airlines/radio cost). | **Partial** |
| **Self-Help** | Briefly touched on in *Baker* (shooting dogs). Court says generally no, but exception for self-defense/protecting property allowed it here. | **Aligned** |
| **Airspace (*Hinman*)** | Major focus. Detailed breakdown of why *ad coelum* is rejected (infinity, inability to possess). | **Aligned** |
| **Repeated Trespass (*Baker*)** | Covered extensively. Distinction between "continuous" and "repeated" (series of acts). Equity acts when damages are inadequate. | **Aligned** |
| **Criminal Enforcement** | Not heavily emphasized in the available transcript text. | **Missed/Skipped** |

**Professor's "Eccentricities" / Focus**:
- **Intuition vs. Law**: Lee emphasized that property rights often rest on deep-seated "intuitions" rather than pure logic (e.g., the "bad man" perspective, or why we feel *Jacque* is right/wrong).
- **History/Context**: extensive background on *Hinman* (Burbank airport, Hollywood stars, 1933 Depression context explaining the holdout behavior).
- **Equity**: Strong interest in the law/equity distinction and the requirements for an injunction (clean hands, inadequate remedy at law).

---

## 2. EXAM SIGNALS #EXAM_SIGNAL

- **Intuitions Matter**: Be prepared to argue *why* a property right should exist based on societal norms or intuitions, acknowledging that black letter law might just be a codification of these feelings.
- **Injunctions vs. Damages**: A key theme. Know *why* an injunction is preferred for repeated trespasses (cost of repeated litigation, difficulty of valuing harm) versus when damages might suffice.
- **"Bad Faith" in Encroachment**: In *Hinman* (spite poles) and *Pile* (knowing trespass), the actor's intent (good vs. bad faith) seems to drive the result, even if the doctrine doesn't explicitly always say so.
- **Valuation Difficulties**: In *Baker*, the inability to put a dollar figure on "animal refuge" or "peace of mind" was a trigger for equitable relief.

---

## 3. CORRECTIONS TO PREP

- **Refinement on *Hinman***: The rule is not just "you don't own the sky." It's "you own as much as you *use* and *only* while using it." The court shifted from "can't own what you can't possess" to a use-based rule.
- **Self-Help Nuance**: In *Baker*, shooting the dog *was* technically a tort/crime, but it didn't bar equitable relief because of the "Clean Hands" doctrine limit: the wrongdoing must be related to the equitable claim, and here the court found it "not so tortious" as to deny relief (self-defense justification).
- **Terminology**: Distinction between "Continuous" (permanent, e.g., wall in *Pile*) and "Repeated/Continual" (series of acts, e.g., dogs in *Baker*).

## 4. DOCTRINAL INSIGHTS

### Airspace Rights (*Hinman*)
- **Rule**: *Ad coelum* is not the law. Landowner owns airspace only to the extent of **actual use**.
- **Rationale**:
    1.  **Possession**: Property requires dominion. You can't possess infinity or empty space.
    2.  **Practicality/implied easement**: Modern flight and radio require traversing airspace. Transaction costs of bargaining with every landowner would be prohibitive (anti-holdout).
- **Remedy**: Trespass lies only if there is **actual injury** to the land or **actual interference** with possession/beneficial use.

### Repeated Trespasses (*Baker v. Howard County Hunt*)
- **Problem**: Damages are inadequate for repeated low-value trespasses because:
    1.  **Multiplicity of Suits**: Plaintiff would have to sue endlessly.
    2.  **Valuation**: Harms (experimental rabbits, peace of mind) are hard to quantify.
- **remedy**: **Injunction**.
- **Clean Hands Defense**: Plaintiff must have "clean hands" to get an injunction. Shooting the dogs was "unclean" but excused here as necessary for defense of property.

### Encroachments (*Pile v. Pedrick*)
- **Fact Pattern**: Foundation encroached 1 3/8 inches underground. Defendant offered to chip it off (entering P's land to do so). P refused entry.
- **Rule (Absolutist)**: An intentional (or even negligent turned intentional upon discovery) encroachment must be removed, regardless of cost/benefit imbalance.
- **Reasoning**: Property rights are absolute. If you cross the line, you must leave.
- **Notes**: Lee notes the "social waste" here (tearing down a wall for 1 inch) but the court upholds the right to exclude rigidly.

---

## 5. POLICY ARGUMENTS

- **Right to Exclude vs. Efficiency**:
    - *Hinman*: Efficiency wins. We need planes/radio. Property rights are curbed to allow progress and prevent holdouts.
    - *Pile*: Right to Exclude wins (at least in PA 1895). Even trivial encroachments are barred to protect the "sanctity" of the line.
- **Institutional Competence**:
    - In *Moore*, court deferred to legislature.
    - In property torts (*Jacque*, *Baker*), courts are active in defining rights based on "fairness" and "deterrence."
- **Fairness/Equity**:
    - *Baker*: "Fox hunters have rights, but landowners' rights are superior." Hierarchical ranking of rights.
    - *Hinman*: "Bad faith" (holding out for money) influenced the decision against the landowner.

## 6. OUTLINE INSERTS

### Airspace (*Hinman*)
> **Rule**: No absolute right to airspace (*ad coelum* rejected). Landowner owns only what they **actually use** and **can possess**.
> **Trespass**: Requires actual injury or interference with use. Overflight without harm is not trespass.
> **Rationale**: Avoid high transaction costs for airlines/radio; prevent holdouts.

### Injunctions for Trespass (*Baker*)
> **When Available**:
> 1.  **Inadequate Remedy at Law**:
>     - Damages speculative/hard to calculate.
>     - Multiplicity of suits required (repeated acts).
> 2.  **Clean Hands**: Plaintiff acted reasonably (e.g., shooting dogs was self-defense).
> **Takeaway**: Injunctions are the standard remedy for *repeated* trespasses to avoid the "buy a forced license" effect of damages.

### Encroachments (*Pile*)
> **Strict Rule**: Even de minimis permanent encroachments (1 3/8 inch foundation) must be removed.
> **Good/Bad Faith**: Once a defendant *knows* of the encroachment and doesn't remove it, it becomes "intentional," justifying harsh equitable remedies (mandatory injunction to remove).

## 7. SOURCE EXTRACTION

- **Restatement (Second) of Torts**: (Implicit in *Baker* discussion of privileges/self-help).
- **Cases**:
    - *Hinman v. Pacific Air Transport* (9th Cir. 1936)
    - *Baker v. Howard County Hunt* (Md. 1936)
    - *Pile v. Pedrick* (Pa. 1895)

---

## 8. PREWRITE OPPORTUNITIES

- **Topic**: Trespass Remedies
- **Trigger**: Fact pattern involving repeated minor intrusions (drones, kids, smells) or a permanent minor encroachment (fence, garage).
- **Analysis**:
    - **Identify**: Is it repeated acts or permanent structure?
    - **Remedy**: If repeated -> Injunction (cite *Baker* factors: multiplicity, valuing harm).
    - **Encroachment**: Is the jx absolutist (*Pile*) or balancing (*Golden Press* - foreshadowed)?
    - **Airspace**: If high up/no harm -> No trespass (*Hinman*).

---

## 9. TRANSCRIPT QC FLAGS

- **Clarification**: *Golden Press* was mentioned as the counter-example to *Pile* but likely discussed in detail next class. Need to confirm the specific balancing test distinctions.
- **Ambiguity**: The "clean hands" generally bars relief if P acted wrongfully. Why exactly was shooting dogs *not* wrongful enough? (Court said "not so tortious" - subjective standard?).
