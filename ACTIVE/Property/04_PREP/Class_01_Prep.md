# Property — Class 1 Prep (Merrill, Smith & Brady)

## Assigned Reading (per professor)

- Casebook pp. 53–61 and 255–260.
- In `02_SOURCES/core/Property CB.md`, these correspond to page markers `#53` through `61`, and `255` through `260` (some page numbers appear as standalone lines inside code fences).

## What to walk into class knowing

- How “first possession” works as a *root of title* (a way ownership can start without a transfer).
- Why the law cares about *clear, public signals* of possession (coordination + reducing conflict).
- How custom can (sometimes) operate like law, and what risks that creates for outsiders/third parties.

## Reading A: pp. 53–61 — Chapter II: Acquisition and Claim Scope

### Chapter framing (p. 53)

- Property can start from *possession* that predates formal records; “possession” can mean factual control, legal possession, and rights to possess.
- “Roots of title” are events that start a chain of ownership; beyond voluntary conveyance, the book flags:
  - first possession,
  - discovery,
  - creation, and
  - accession (owning a primary thing gives claims over related subordinate things, like fruits of a tree).
- Possession + accession help define *claim scope* (what exactly the owner’s claim includes).
- Conflicts arise when multiple acquisition principles point to different owners or when acquisition is involuntary.

### A. First Possession (pp. 53–54)

- Most ownership traces back through transfers, but chains must start somewhere.
- “First in time” sounds simple but forces questions:
  - What counts as “possession”?
  - What counts as “unclaimed”?
  - Where do the decision standards come from (treatise rules, custom, policy, etc.)?

### 1. Wild Animals (pp. 54–61)

#### Case: *Pierson v. Post* (N.Y. 1805) (pp. 54–58)

**Setup / facts**

- Post, with dogs/hounds, is hunting a fox on unoccupied/waste land; Pierson, knowing this, kills and takes the fox.
- Post sues (tort action) claiming Pierson wrongfully interfered with Post’s claim.

**Issue**

- Does pursuit (chasing with hounds), without capture, create a property right in the wild animal sufficient to sue an interloper?

**Majority rule (Tompkins, J.)**

- Wild animals are owned by “occupancy” (capture), not by pursuit alone.
- The majority emphasizes a *certain-control* idea: possession requires capture or something that effectively removes the animal’s natural liberty and places it within the pursuer’s control.
  - Mere pursuit is not enough.
  - The opinion suggests (more generally) that mortal wounding *with continued pursuit* or trapping/ensnaring that makes escape impossible can be enough, but those facts are not present here.

**Majority reasoning**

- Treatise-based authority (Roman/continental/English sources) favors capture over pursuit.
- Certainty: a clear line reduces fights and litigation among would-be claimants.
- Pierson may have acted badly, but the law supplies no remedy if Post lacked a property right.

**Dissent (Livingston, J.)**

- Treats the question as one where practical norms (including hunter custom) and policy should matter.
- Emphasizes encouragement to eliminate a “noxious” animal and fairness to the laboring pursuer.
- Endorses a more pursuit-protective approach (especially when the pursuer is close to taking the animal and the interloper acts with knowledge).

**Takeaways to bring to class**

- The fight is not only “who *deserves* it?” but “what rule best coordinates behavior and reduces conflict?”
- Competing conceptions of “possession”:
  - bright-line capture/certain control vs.
  - protected pursuit / near-capture / custom-sensitive standards.

#### Notes & Questions after *Pierson* (pp. 58–61)

1. **The dispute as local politics + social conflict (background scholarship)**
   - The book summarizes modern historical work suggesting the fox dispute reflected broader tensions in the community (established elites vs. new wealth; competing visions of who controls commons and privileges).
2. **Fox hunting as social practice (custom + incentives)**
   - Organized fox hunting is described as a social ritual more than an efficient method of pest control; different norms (like how the fox is killed) shaped expectations.
   - The note contrasts “foxes as outlaw predators” vs. later landowner control over hunting access (and how that affects capture rules and *ratione soli* ideas).
3. **Using ancient/foreign treatises to decide modern ownership**
   - Question: what does it assume about the nature of property rights when judges treat far-flung sources as comparable authority?
   - Contrast: is “arbitration of sportsmen” (custom/community practice) a different theory of where property rules come from?
4. **Rights “against the world” created in a two-party lawsuit**
   - Question: how can a rule that binds everyone emerge from a dispute between A and B?
   - Prompts alternative claimants: landowner (or common proprietors) and the state (state “ownership” of wildlife, including the later history of that doctrine).
5. **First possession beyond animals; labor-desert theory**
   - Locke’s labor argument is presented as a classic justification for first possession (mixing labor + leaving enough and as good; avoiding waste/spoilage).
   - Questions: which opinion better reflects labor-desert? Why does labor imply ownership rather than only a claim for compensation?
   - Custom as possible alternative grounding: if hunters had a strong settled practice, should law track it?
6. **Possession as communication**
   - Question: who is the audience for the signal of possession (the rival hunter, other hunters, landowners, the general public)?
   - The note links possession to the need to communicate a claim clearly enough to coordinate behavior.
7. **First-in-time can cause wasteful races**
   - Question: when does first possession work well (quickly produces a clear winner; salient signals cause others to stand down) versus poorly (races, conflict, waste)?

#### Case begins: *Keeble v. Hickeringill* (Q.B. 1707) (p. 61)

- Plaintiff operates a decoy pond on his land, investing in equipment and decoy birds to attract wildfowl for capture.
- Defendant allegedly fires guns to scare off the birds to deprive plaintiff of the profitable use of the decoy pond.
- On p. 61, the case is set up as an interference-with-capture/enterprise problem (the opinion continues after the assigned page range).

## Reading B: pp. 255–260 — Commodification, Custom, and Community

### Commodification debate note (p. 255)

- The book frames a recurring divide:
  - pro-expansion of property/contract rights in contested areas (often described as “commodification”), vs.
  - anti-commodification arguments emphasizing equality, community, and limits on treating body/intimacy/identity as property.
- Adds a complication: some feminist arguments contend anti-commodification positions can sometimes reinforce subordination (the book flags divorce/marital property as an example later).
- Emphasizes that “market” and “nonmarket” spheres are often mixed rather than cleanly separated.

### C. Community and Custom (pp. 255–260)

- Custom often emerges inside a community to solve coordination problems; the legal question is when courts should adopt custom as law.

#### Case: *Ghen v. Rich* (D. Mass. 1881) (pp. 255–258)

**Facts**

- Fin-back whalers off Cape Cod use bomb-lances; whales sink, later float; recovery is uncertain.
- Industry practice: the killer (identifiable by lance markings) owns the whale; finders notify the killer and receive a modest salvage.
- A whale killed by the libellant later washes ashore; a finder sells it at auction to the respondent, who processes the blubber/oil; the killer later claims ownership/value.

**Issue**

- Is the industry custom valid so that the killer owns the whale despite delayed physical recovery?

**Holding**

- Yes. The custom is recognized; property remains with the killer under the established usage; the respondent owes damages.

**Reasoning**

- The custom is narrowly limited to a specific industry context and is longstanding and widely followed.
- It requires the “only act of appropriation possible” in the circumstances; without legal support for the custom, the industry would collapse because labor/investment would be too easily appropriated by chance finders.
- The custom includes a salvage-like payment to encourage reporting/recovery.
- The court analogizes to related whaling decisions (capture/possession and custom-based “iron holds the whale” rules) to show both that first takers can acquire property and that some customs can be legally validated.

**Damages**

- Market value of oil minus processing/preparation costs, plus interest from conversion; no costs awarded (case treated as important/novel).

#### Notes & Questions after *Ghen* (pp. 258–260)

1. **Whaling norms as structured first-in-time**
   - Contrasts “fast-fish/loose-fish” (ownership while attached to boat) with “iron-holds-the-whale” (exclusive rights while in fresh pursuit).
   - Suggests different resources (whale types/conditions) produce different efficient norms; raises the idea that close-knit groups generate wealth-maximizing rules, sometimes imposing “outgroup” harms.
2. **Outsiders + notice + fairness**
   - The finder is not necessarily an insider; questions whether and when it is fair (or efficient) to bind outsiders to custom they may not know.
   - Raises conservation/externality questions: norms good for whalers may be bad for society.
3. **Communication**
   - Suggests a norm that resembles ordinary possession rules may be easier for others to understand and comply with.
4. **Norms vs customs; custom becoming law**
   - Distinguishes social norms (often informal and “beyond law”) from custom (more articulated and closer to legal recognition).
   - Notes that in some contexts formal recognition/registration of “customary” rights can shift authority away from families/communities toward the state and officials.
5. **Standardization, third parties, and coercion**
   - Property forms are standardized to reduce information burdens on third parties; recognizing idiosyncratic custom as binding law may undermine that function.
   - Communities can be coercive or exclusionary; the note flags historical and modern examples where enforcement can be discriminatory or violent.

### 2. Cultural Patrimony (p. 260)

- Extends “personhood/community” concerns to cultural artifacts removed from their communities of significance.
- Introduces NAGPRA (Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act) as a statutory response.

#### Case begins: *United States v. Corrow* (10th Cir. 1997) (p. 260)

- The appeal challenges (as vague) NAGPRA’s definition of “cultural patrimony,” used to support a trafficking conviction; the court affirms.
- Background on p. 260 focuses on:
  - the cultural/religious status of the Navajo ceremonial items (and why “mask” is a misleading English label),
  - customary transfer/loan practices within Navajo communities, and
  - the circumstances of the defendant’s acquisition from the family after the singer’s death (the legal analysis continues after the assigned pages).
