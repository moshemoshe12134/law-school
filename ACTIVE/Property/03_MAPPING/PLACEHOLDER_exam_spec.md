### Parsing Strategy:

**Step 1**: Identify your professor
- If Professor Glass → prioritize Glass exam
- If Professor Heller → prioritize Heller exams
- If Professor Merrill → prioritize Merrill exams (many available!)
- If different professor → parse all for general patterns

**Step 2**: Use `TEMPLATES/exam_spec_template.md`
- Analyze question types (issue-spotter, policy essay, short answer)
- Count questions per topic area
- Note grading rubrics (if available in model answers)
- Identify recurring hypo patterns

**Step 3**: Create final exam spec
- Extract topic weighting
- Document favored sources (cases, statutes, Restatement)
- Understand policy framework
- Build attack strategy

## Quick Initial Scan (Before Full Parsing):

When you get 30 minutes, do a quick scan:
1. **Open 2-3 past exams** (start with most recent)
2. **Count questions** and estimate time per question
3. **Skim fact patterns** to identify common topic areas
4. **Note exam format**: Open book? Closed book? Page limit?
5. **Check if model answers exist** (these are gold for grading insights)
