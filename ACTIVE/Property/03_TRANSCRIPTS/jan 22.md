### Ghen v. Rich, 8 F. 159 (D. Mass. 1881)

**Rule of Law**
Industry custom can create property rights when (1) longstanding and universal, (2) the only practical means of appropriation, and (3) necessary to sustain the industry.

**Facts + Procedural Posture**

1. Fin-back whalers off Cape Cod use bomb-lances; whales sink and later float
2. Industry custom: killer (identifiable by lance) owns the whale; finders notify killer and receive modest salvage
3. Plaintiff kills whale; it later washes ashore; finder sells to defendant (who processes it)
4. Plaintiff sues for value of oil

**Issue**
Does industry custom give the killer property rights in a whale not yet physically recovered?

**Holding & Reasoning**
**Yes.** Custom recognized; plaintiff owns the whale.

1. **Longstanding, universal practice**: Whaling community universally follows this custom
2. **Practical necessity**: Fin-back whales sink; physical recovery is delayed/uncertain. Requiring immediate physical possession would make whaling impossible
3. **Industry-sustaining**: Without legal support, killers would have no protection from opportunistic finders → industry collapses
4. **Salvage incentive**: Custom includes payment to finders, encouraging reporting and recovery
5. **Limited scope**: Custom applies only within the specific industry and context
6. Original hunter / fisher did in fact mortally wound the whale. To find whether hunter broke off pursuit relies on industry custom.

**Disposition:** Plaintiff (killer) recovers value of oil minus processing costs

Arguments against custom:
1. How to know what the custom is?
