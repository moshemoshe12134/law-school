SPEAKER 0
Oh. Yeah. Definitely bigger. OK, is it good or? Kimberly, it's probably too big for me.

SPEAKER 1
I am, but don't make another one.

SPEAKER 0
I will keep this as a treasured souvenir. Of my time at Columbia Law School and we're in the event that the, the, the smaller one. maybe we can try to get something that sort of intermediate. Now I did double what the. Really. Yeah, I mean You're right, but it's double up. Yeah, it's like you would think quadruple. Yeah, it seemed like quadruple, so. Maybe 1.5. Yeah, so my guess is when it's double, doubled it in both directions, which is 4 times as big, and I actually was just sort of thinking like 1.4. Yeah, OK, all right, so. All right, thank you.

SPEAKER 1
Someday I'll muster the courage to go for the lights.

SPEAKER 0
uh, how's the audio?

SPEAKER 1
Can you hear me OK? in the back? Pardon?

SPEAKER 0
Alright I Oh.

SPEAKER 1
OK, how's the audio now?

SPEAKER 0
Better? Oh, we got feedback. How's this?

SPEAKER 1
More or less audible. Nobody's saying anything, so I'll treat you, so I'll assume that that means that nobody can hear me and therefore it doesn't matter what I'm gonna say, so that's great. Um, I, I apologize that I have a bit of a cold or something, I think that's it's it's not terrible, but it is doing not good things to my voice. And so as a result, I can't really project at the moment. And the great fear in this line of work, well, there are many fears in this line of work, but one of them is developing laryngitis. Which is not optimal in this business, so I'm gonna have to try to nurse my voice here a bit and so I apologize for the lack of ability to project ordinarily. Um, uh, let's see here. Last class, we began by discussing another potential principle for allocating property rights in general. Um, and that is the correlative rights view. It goes by other names as well. The basic idea is that the just allocation of property entitlements is one that is based on the relationship of the item in question to some other item whose allocation is deemed to be just. So because you own a certain amount of x, therefore you're deemed to own a certain amount of y. And of course the Premise for that, right, the reason why owningy by virtue of owning X is deemed to be just depends upon the justice of your owning X in the first place, right? If you stole X, then maybe you shouldn't be, you know, entitled to get Y. But if the entitlement to X is just, then the entitlement to Y is deemed to be just, so you know. You own the tree, you own the fruit, you own that cow, you own the calf, and so forth. And we talked about this specifically in the context of the Ed Coilum rule. All right, um, by virtue of owning the surface. Some land you own everything above it and everything below it. Edwards versus Simms was our case on this. This is about the ownership of a cave. Um, or rather that portion of the cave that was beneath the surface of the land owned by HP Lee, FP Lee, excuse me. My apologies to Mr. Lee, um. The majority address this with just a straightforward doctrinal application of Ed Coyle. Ownership of the surface entitles Lee to ownership of everything below the surface, caves below the surface, Lee's entitled to it. The dissent criticized this implicitly on the grounds that it's basically arbitrary to allocate ownership. Of the cave to people who just happen to be above the cave, but I have no way of being able to actually access the cave or do anything with it, for better or for worse. Instead, the dissent thought that we should focus on what has made the thing valuable or who has made the thing valuable. Right, because what is valuable isn't the natural resource. It's kind of, yeah, in in some cases with like gold or something like that, it seems like maybe that's valuable for the cave, one of the interesting things about it is it is literally a void, right, it's emptiness, it's like it's nothing. All right, and so what has made that valuable is the effort that Edwards had put into it. So what's being fought over is not the black vacuum that the uninitiated call a cave in the words of the dissent, but instead something intangible and indefinable. It is Edwards' vision translated into a reality. And from that, the dissent concludes the person who created that value then should get to own it. Edwards made the cave valuable. Edwards should own the whole cave. Then we turn to sequential possession. Who owns property when we have a sequence of people or series of people who own it, excuse me, possess it, who possess it at different times, each of whom claims to own the property. So we start with the famous case of Armory versus Delamere. This is the chimney sweeps boy case. We have sequential possession of a jewel. First, the true owner had it. Then lost it. Then the chimney sweeps boy found it. Then the goldsmith, the goldsmith's apprentice, took it without permission. So we have a true owner followed by a finder, followed by a converter, converter is the wrongdoer. The court held famously that a finder quote has such a property as will enable him to keep it against all but the rightful owner, unquote. So the finder's rights are good against all the world except the true owner. That rule then naturally raises the question of what happens if we have two different finders. Disputing, right? So rather than having a finder, true owner finder converter, what if we have true owner, finder, finder? Does each of them have a right to good against the other? If so, how do you decide who wins? Clark versus Maloney. Uh, address this. We have pine logs found in Delaware Bay, then they're lost, and then they're found again by somebody else. And the court says that the first finder has a right good against the second finder, because the first finder's right was, was good against all the world except the true owner. And losing an item doesn't reduce your property rights to it, so the true owner's property rights weren't diminished when he or she lost the jewel or the pine logs. Consequently, it makes sense that the first finder's property rights aren't diminished when after losing. A jewel or pine logs or whatever it is. So first finder words. What happens then if the first person to take the thing. After the true owner is not a finder but rather a converter. So what if we have true owner followed by converter followed by converter. Armory is not going to tell us what to do. In that case, because Armory says that a finder's rights are good against all the world except the true owner, but not a finder, converter. So we need some other rule. This is Anderson versus Goldberg addresses this. Plaintiff had acquired pine logs by trespassing, and then the defendant took the pine logs at the sawmill. Without permission, and the court held that anyone who has obtained possession of property. Even if by committing a tour. has a right good against a mere wrongdoer who's a stranger to the property. So first wrongdoer wins and the court was explicitly motivated by concerns about avoiding conflict, avoiding incentives for wrongdoers to go snagging stuff that other people have snagged earlier. So the first converter wins. In all three of these scenarios, the upshot is the first person after the true owner wins, whether binder or converter, the first one in wins. OK, that takes us to today. Where we have adverse possession. This is um another form of sequential possession, but typically in the context of real property, by which I mean dirt and buildings, right? We know now real property doesn't mean like real versus fake. Real property means land and things attached to land. So, dirt and buildings, basically, and also trees that are attached to it and so forth, you know, land and stuff on the land. Attached to the lamp. OK, so adverse possession is sequential possession, but in the context of real property rather than. The other kind of property. I want to pause now and just pull you folks. This is not, there's no right answer, no wrong answer. This is genuinely a public opinion survey. I execute it ineptly because you are not a randomly selected group of people, but, um, that's OK because it's kind of the audience that I'm looking for here. So, um, I'm having some discussion with some folks about what the best term to use is for property that is things like pencils or water bottles, or laptop computers, or hats or things like that. There are various terms that you will encounter in case law and in the literature. And relatively old fashioned term is chattels. These are chattels. Another old fashioned term that's less common. Kinda like it, but it's, uh, you don't see it a lot nowadays is movables. Unlike, you know, dirt and buildings, you know, these things are movable. Um, another, uh, uh, term that's used quite a lot nowadays is personal property. All of these three, show of hands. Suppose you could set a rule, the well, the law when it's talking about these things is going to use one of, you know, just just one of these terms, right, and you get to pick. How many of you would pick chattel? Somebody was going to say yes and then flinched. All right, have the courage of your convictions. Yeah, you have a question? Chattel. Ah, so you got, so your three options are gonna be chattel, movable, or personal property. All right, those are your 3. Got a better suggestion, I'm open to it, but uh, yeah, well. Stuff was suggested in the meeting in which I was as a joke, but. Problem is that, uh, so there's there's a problem with stuff that also applies to personal property. I'll get back to why stuff might not be optimal. All right, um, the, but good thought, um. Uh, all right, so how, so nobody for nobody is willing to say if they like chattels. All right, how about movable, you like chattels? All right, chattels. All right, there we are. Do you have lawyers in your family? OK, good. All right, um, uh, how about movables? All right. A fair number of people like movables. How about personal property? Most people like personal property. That seems and it kind of makes sense. There's a problem with personal property in that the kind of stuff that we're talking about, yeah, I use stuff, I use stuff, um, the kind of stuff that we're talking about is tangible personal property. So you have a bunch of, there's a bunch of personal property, things that you own that are not tangible. For example, money in a bank account. Right, it's not Scrooge McDuck land, right? There is no like big vault with like the gold coins with you in it, right? It's just data somewhere out there. So you own money, you may have other investments and things. You have a bunch of intangibles that are also personal property. Now you could solve that problem by referring to it as tangible personal property when you want to distinguish it from intangibles, which is great, um, works. Um, sounds modern. Most people like it. Probably it's the way to go. But it's an awful lot of syllables, and awful long if you're writing it out over and over and over again, a lot shorter just to say chattels. But, um, yeah, all right, uh, that's the, that's the problem with stuff. Stuff is short, but stuff encompasses everything, right, including tangibles, intangibles. Um, fictional things, right, uh, purely fictive entities or stuff, it's all just stuff.

SPEAKER 0
So stuff probably isn't a winner, but, uh, thanks for

SPEAKER 1
the suggestion, uh, and thanks for the feedback. Somebody had a question? I thought, yeah.

SPEAKER 0
So I was just gonna ask, like, why can't they just say like items or objects?

SPEAKER 1
Well, you could say object, um, the, uh, so maybe object is good, yeah, object might not be bad. Um, the problem again just becomes, so this is one of the things with legal terminology, right? Every few decades, there is a push toward making the law comprehensible. We should make the law comprehensible so that ordinary people can just sit down and read the law and know what governs them, what the rules are. This makes perfect sense, right? It never really works, and the reason why it doesn't work is maybe it's because lawyers are trying to keep things obscure because they get paid. Yeah, there's probably something to that, but the problem is when you try to actually make things precise, and precision is the lawyer's stock in trade. Um, when you try to make things precise, ordinary language kind of falls apart because it, you know, it works more or less most of the time, and you kind of get the gist of what's going on. When you have legal disputes, it matters a lot whether somebody has actually a right to what, what do you precisely have a right to, right? Uh, and you have to sort that out. And so that's why the ordinary language thing gets tricky. And so object is a little vague, right? It's a little broad. And so that's, you know, that's how you end up doing chattel, but. I think probably chattel's out. It's probably gonna be personal property anyway. Thanks for the feedback. With respect to adverse possession, we are typically not talking personal property. I will use personal property here, uh, hereafter, unless I. Um, Typically you're talking real property. You have a true owner. Whose possession has been dispossessed by the adverse possessor. Now, ordinarily, that's a tort, tort of trespass, right? You may not be expert in trespass, but you have an intuitive sense of trespass, right? You can't just go wandering into somebody else's house without their permission or wandering onto somebody else's property without their permission. Um In order to get on the campus of Columbia University now I have to push my ID there, right, and if I uh try to get in without uh carting in, then hey, I'm trespassing. All right, so ordinarily. You take possession of somebody else's land, you're trespassing. You're a trespasser. It's not good. What remedy can you get for that? Well, if you're the owner, one thing you can get standard thing is damages. Uh, damages for the loss that you've suffered. And so suppose I trespass on your land. All right, that's, that's not good, you get damages. And suppose then I just keep trespassing for a while. Man, that's, that's really not good. Now damages are going up. Trespass longer, really bad. Now damages are getting way up. Trespass longer. Oh boy, damage is getting really high. Trespass longer, hey, I own it now. It's mine. You try to go on the land. You're a trespasser. I can get damages from you. All right. What's up with that? Ordinarily. You might expect based on armory, right, uh, that the person or, and, and the subsequent cases, right, is that the person who adversely possesses the thing, who's possessed the property without permission of the true owner. Should at most have a right good against all the world except the true owner. But that's not what the law says. The law says no, the rights good against all the world, period, including the true owner. All right, um, under certain circumstances, somebody gets to own the property, not despite their wrongdoing, but because of their wrongdoing. That should strike you as weird. Because it is. All right, so, what's up with that? We'll talk about some reasons at the end of the class, we'll talk about some reasons why the law might have this doctrine. But, uh, before we do, we should just talk about the doctrine. This is, uh, this is stuff you'll like because it's just straightforward things to memorize for the exam, the bar, and it just feels like law, and it's like, OK, good. Um. All right, so what do we got here? Um, there are various traditional hornbook elements that need to be satisfied in order for a claim of ownership via adverse possession to succeed. These are various characteristics that the adverse possession must have. Um, What are they? Hang on. Uh, oh, to change things up, I will use this. chalkboard. Might be a mistake for a reason that will become evident later, but we'll see. All right. Fancy Columbia chalk and the. rough and unpleasant Columbia chalkboard, but you get everything. All right, um, so there are 6 standard hornb elements for adverse possession. I should note, and we will see an example of this in the upper ray, that not every jurisdiction has exactly the same list. There is some variation across jurisdictions, um. But by and large, there's a lot of overlap, right? Even jurisdictions that don't have quite the same list as other jurisdictions, still there's going to be a lot of overlap. And so you get some standard hornbook elements, things that have to be true to the adverse possession in order. For it to ripen in the title. And what are they? So give me one, so we're just gonna go around the room here, yeah. All right, so here's what we're going on, so here's, uh, the way I'm gonna do this here. Um, Does make an impressive sound, but. That sounds like I'm like teaching. Um, the, uh, so I am going to list these out, not necessarily in the order in which you tell me them, um, because I'm gonna list them out in the order in which we will then go through them in detail. So we're gonna get them all on the board and then we're gonna go through them in detail. So for pedagogical reasons, I I'm gonna put them on just. Ah, um, on the board in a different order, maybe than you tell me that, um, I should note. That this order is pretty much arbitrary. Even jurisdiction, you know, there, there's no canonical order. You can put them in any order. It doesn't, it doesn't matter. The, the order doesn't mean. Um, it's, uh, so I'm just going to do it in circle. Anyway, you said claim of ownership, is that right? Yes. All right, um, this is the long one, which is why I'm like kind of nervous about starting over on this side. I might run out of board here. Um, so I am going to write this out in a much longer winded way than you said. All right. Um, uh, claim ownership is a term that's used in Scott versus Anderson Tully. Um, there are variations on it, and so I'm going to put all these variations in this one thing. All right, so here's what we got. Adverse Or hostel. Under a claim of right. Or in some jurisdictions color of title. Whew, time for a nap. All right, um, the, um, all right, so that is. What is actually just referred to, jeez, that handwriting is terrible. I apologize for that. I, I need to practice on that. Um, the, um, so that's claim of ownership is the way they put it there, but there are various different formulations that you will see. In different jurisdictions, you, no one will write it out like that. Absolutely nobody does it that way. But, um, this is, um. Uh, so I, I'm writing it out like this because it's the sort of the comprehensive thing, right? It's gonna be some sort of subset or variant on something in there is this one. OK, so good, we got the long one out. The rest are shorter. Uh, what else do we have?

SPEAKER 0
Um, it has to be continuous.

SPEAKER 1
Number 4, this is Family Feud style here. Continuous.

SPEAKER 0
What else we got, yeah. needs to be actual possession.

SPEAKER 1
Uh, what else? Somebody in the back, yeah, way in the back, as far back as we could go here, that would be, uh. Well I could use the massive seating chart that I was given, it's basically a bed sheet size. Yeah, it's Mr.

SPEAKER 0
Niles. All right, there we go. Open and notorious.

SPEAKER 1
And 2 more, yeah.

SPEAKER 0
Exclusive.

SPEAKER 1
That's number 2. And take us home over here.

SPEAKER 0
Peaceful. Peaceful. All right, so that, so I'm not gonna put it

SPEAKER 1
down here.

SPEAKER 0
Um, you're not wrong.

SPEAKER 1
Uh, Scott versus Anderson Tully adds another element to the Horn book element. I've already mentioned to you that different jurisdictions vary a bit. Scott versus Anderson Tully does say it has to be peaceful. All right, um, it does. I'll, I'll get back to that in a bit, but that's not one of the standard ones, so I'm going to leave that one off. Um, yeah.

SPEAKER 2
Statutory time period.

SPEAKER 1
OK, so possibly legible, here. Uh, yeah, not exactly parallel there. When I was a little kid, they had some chalkboards that actually had lines painted across them there, so you could like keep everything, you know, all lined up. Um, I could have used one of those. OK, so we've got actual, and let me pause a note here. One. General category term for these things you will sometimes see is the adjectival requirements. They're called the adjectival requirements because each of these things is an adjective modifying the possession. So the claimant's possession had to have been actual possession. My possession is a noun, actual is an adjective. How many of you had to diagram sentences in school? All right, good, glad to see that the rest of you missed out. How many people you, how many of you enjoy diagramming sentences? All right, future tax lawyers right there. I'm not even joking. Uh, this is, uh, if you like enjoying figuring out how these various pieces fit together, think about taking statutory, statute-based cases like tax. Um, it's great for figuring out these, uh, the way the bits go together. You didn't learn how to diagram sentences, a lot of people don't like it, but it's a really good way of learning grammar. OK, so we got adjectives, modifying nouns, so it has to be actual possession, it has to be exclusive possession, and so forth. All right, see the adjectival requirements. The possession must be actual, exclusive, open and notorious, continuous, adverse, or hostile under claim a right in some jurisdictions, color of title, and for the statutory period of time. Um, Now, ah. All right, so Scott versus Anderson Tully, I just mentioned they have another one, right? They have a, uh, additional one, which was peaceful. So let me just say something about Scott versus Anderson Tully. This case is, uh, intermediate Mississippi Appeals court case 2015, I think, yeah, 2015, page 156. Um, setup for this is Scott owns some land. Anderson Tully removed timber from the land. That's a problem, because if you own the land, you own the timber on the land, kind of correlative thing again, right? You own the land, you own the timber that grows up. So Anderson Tully removes timber. Scott Sue says, hey, those are my trees. Anderson Tully argues as a defense, no, they're not. We now own that land by virtue of adverse possession. Anderson Tully had marked a purported property line many years earlier, and the disputed acreage was on Anderson Tully's side of that property line. The Court in fact does rule for Anderson Tully. They say they got uh. Adverse possession actually worked there. Um, now, In addressing the peaceful, so they list various requirements, they say it's got to be peaceful too. In addressing whether the possession was peaceful, they elaborate a bit on what that means. They say that no one had complained about the survey that had marked the line or it interfered with Anderson Tully's use before adverse possession ripen the title. So basically, you know, nobody was causing a ruckus there. Um So, uh, that was, that was good enough. Now, the court says the mere existence of expected disputes does not make this not peaceful. There's a lot of knots in there. Um, the basic idea is it's still peaceful even if there are expected disputes, right, which makes sense because otherwise, basically no adverse possession would ever qualify because you would expect, like you'd expect, at least if there's any uncertainty at all as to what's going on, you would expect there might be a dispute over, you know, who owns what. OK. So I'm not going to work through each of these requirements in a little bit more detail, sort of flesh out what's going on. So first up is actual, gotta be actual possession. OK, um, what does that mean? Well, pretty much does what it says on the tin. I mean, you gotta actually possess the thing. Um, that one's pretty straightforward. What might not satisfy that? That's always a good thing to think about when you're trying to understand what something means, it's like, what does it not mean? What might not satisfy that? And I think a standard example would be something like the following. Imagine that there is an There's a parcel that is 50 acres, that's 50 acres large. All right. Here's the parcel, 50 acres large. Oh, big moment for you in your legal education here. I believe this is gonna be the first appearance of the generic name used for parcels and property law. I don't know what it is. Black acre, yes, there you are. So parcels are just referred to if you need a so often the law you need some generic name for something. So a generic hunk of land or hunk of property is black acre. If you need another one, it's green acre, white acre, red acre, blue acre, doesn't matter. P, put in a color and stick acre after it and you're good to go. If you're a Brit, you can spell it AC. R E And is it different in English? I don't know who cares, um, I'm under the weather. All right, so, um, I guess it's, I guess same probably in an American English. All right. So we got Black acre, 50 acres. All right. Now, suppose somebody is on Blackacre, this is 50 acre. And this is say 2 acres right there. All right, and they have like fenced in black acre, and they planted grass, so they fenced in these 2 acres, they planted grass on it, and maybe they built a house on it and, you know, put in a swimming pool, they did a bunch of stuff on it. It looks like they're actually possessing those 2 acres. But the parcel is black acre, right? If you look on the, you know, if you like going to buy the land, it's like 50 acres there, and they probably are not actually possessing those other 48 acres. They're actually possessing two, but not actually possessing the whole thing, which will have legal significance that we'll get back to in a bit. All right, um, All right Columbia, so I'll just mention, since you have such a stellar international law, history and faculty here. Anyone know what the generic name for a country is if you're doing international law? Ruttania. It's from like some 19, 1900 Pirates of Penzance, I think or something, some romance there. The fictional country, it's like, yeah, it's Rutania is, uh, I think Erawan sometimes shows up too, which is nowhere spelled backwards. OK. Of news you cannot use. All right, um, so that's it for actual. What about exclusive? Exclusive means that you have to possess, you, the adverse possessor, must possess the property to the exclusion of others. You can't be sharing possession with others, and really you can't be sharing possession with the true owner. Um, we will talk later about what rights ownership gives you, but one of the big ones, maybe the big one, is the right to exclude, the right to exclude others. So Scott versus Anderson Tully says that the requirement that the possession be exclusive. Doesn't mean that no one else can use the property. Um, why is that? Because if true, if you're a true owner. You can let other people use your property. That's not a problem, right? You can invite people over, you can let somebody use your pool or whatever, you know, that's fine. So if you're an adverse possessor and you're letting other people use the property, then you're just acting like a true owner and that's fine. No problem there. Um, The requirement, Scott versus Anderson Tully cashes out, but the entire uh what the uh requirement. Ultimately means is that the adverse possessor must evince an intention. I hate the term, but. Evinces an intention, right, gives evidence of, you know, sort of displays, demonstrates, right, an intention, um, to possess the land to the exclusion of everyone else's claims. Not And it must be the case that their conduct gave unequivocal indication that he or she was exercising the dominion of a sole owner. Right, so you got to evince an intention to have the thing exclusive of anybody else's claims, right? Nobody else's claims are going to be good against me, and you have to give unequivocal indication that you're exercising the dominion, the control, you know, um. Uh, over the property of a sole owner, somebody just owns it by himself or herself. And note. A couple of things about the language here, right, events. Right, that is like giving evidence of, right, showing, demonstrating something like that. That's kind of objective, right? That isn't talking about what's actually going on in the person's head. It's about what people looking at what this person is doing would say. Likewise, giving unequivocal indication that's exercised in the dominion of the sole owner, unequivocal indication is again about what it is people looking at this would reasonably infer. this is objective rather than subjective here, right? We're not trying to look inside the head of the adverse possessor. We're looking at people looking at the adverse possessor would. See Which takes us to open a notorious. All right, this is designed to show that the adverse possessor, excuse me, true owner. Designed to show that the true owner. Had notice of the adverse possession. If not actual notice, had constructive notice, right? Constructive at this point in your legal career, you're probably familiar with the notion of constructive things. These are things that aren't things, but we pretend that they are. Constructive notice, so actual notices, yeah, you actually had notice. You actually, you know, somebody told you, you knew what was going on. Um, constructive notices, nobody told you. You didn't know what was going on, but we're gonna still treat you as if you did, right. Um, The basic idea is if the possession was open and notorious. Then the true owner should have known what was going on. If he or she was keeping tabs on the property right. It was done in such a way that the true owner. You know, exercising reasonable diligence and monitoring the property would have realized, hey, that's not right. That shouldn't be going on. I should do something. Scott versus Anderson Tully says the following and. Expresses this requirement somewhat lyrically. All right, um, er, uh, applying a metaphor here. The possessor must, is it me or is it warm in this room? It's warm in this, OK, so it's like 2 degrees outside and we're gonna gonna solve that problem and make it 200 here and then, yeah, it's sort of, sort of averages out all right, well. If you're too hot, my apologies, I don't see any thermostat in here, um, probably better than too cold, I don't know. Um, OK. The possessor must quote. Unfurl his flag on the land and keep it flying so that the actual owner may see and if he will that an enemy has invaded his domains and planted the standard of conquest, unquote. All right, this is highly metaphorical, right, um, the idea of unfurling the flag and planting the standard of conquest is a metaphor. Do not, please go into court and argue, Your Honor, my client had not lost property through adverse possession. At no point did the plaintiff plant any flag, pennant, or other device on the land. Like, no, no, no, no, that's just, it's, it's a metaphor, right? Doing stuff that shows, hey, I am claiming this thing. I was got a kick out as a kid. I, uh, I like seeing these stories in history or whatever in which like somebody lands on some island and plants a flag and says, I claim this land for Spain. It's like, OK, well, I hope you had fun doing that, but like why would anyone else, uh, care? I don't know, um, but the idea is there that you're doing something that anyone would see. Now, um, I will also just note one other thing about what I read out. Which is that it's not actually written in English. Ah, so it starts out OK, says, you know, the possessor must quote unfurl his flag on the land and keep it flying. So far, so good. I understand that. So that the actual owner may see, and if he will, that an enemy has invaded his domain. Wait, what the heck? Uh, try to diagram that sentence, it just doesn't work, that that the actual owner may see, comma, and if he will, that an enemy has invaded his domains. Very mysterious. Uh, when I read that initially, I thought, OK, uh, the old fashioned case, but no, it's 2015, so it's like just 10 years old. Um, oh, all right, typo in the casebook. That happens. Uh, so I went and I checked the actual reported version of the case. No, that's there. All right, well, what's up with that? So If you look at the reported version of the case, you see that they are citing an earlier case. They are taken from an earlier case, so it's like, OK, I'll check the earlier case. There's a typo, courts make typo stick. Earlier case, same thing. OK, but they cited something earlier. All right, so check that one. Same thing. I am now still perplexed. Eventually you go back far enough, and I ran out of things to look up because it hit a treatise, the edition, relevant edition of which was published in 1987. And they were quoting the treatise. I was like, OK, uh, so I guess it's from a treatise, but I can't get my hands on the 1987 edition of the treatise. So then I did some other looking around, and I determined that this, that the quote ultimately came from a case in 1887, so 100 years before the treatise. And in the original version, the 1887 version, the mysterious word and doesn't appear there. So the sentence actually makes perfect sense if you read it the original way. So it's so that the actual owner may see, if he will, that an enemy has invaded his domains. All right Why am I harping on this? Why am I taking your time with this? Well, for a couple of reasons. Um, one, do not automatically trust what treatises say. They may get things wrong, all right, stuff in there could be wrong. 2, if you don't understand something. Figure it out. Look it up until you actually do, because you can't just assume that it does make sense. Basically we had all these courts over and over and over again, mindlessly repeating something that literally makes no sense. Um, but they're quoting it so well, some earlier quote quoted it, so I guess it's gotta be good, and, you know. You got a lot of work to do. Time is short. No one's gonna get mad at you, probably if you just copy and paste the garbage in there. It's like, yeah, we're done. All right, um. And fine, like all these people retired, nobody got fired, but you're messing up the law. So, you know, don't do that, you know, attention to detail. If you don't understand something. Dig into it until you finally understand what's going on. Final note on this, obviously we've got problems with that with respect to AI, right, all its hallucinations, all these other things, it is not unique to AI. This stuff always handed down before there's AI stuff, right? Just people mindlessly going, ah, it's the easy thing, so I'll quote it. Don't do that. All right. So the court says here possession was visible. So in cashing out open and notorious, um, it's emphasizes the fact with respect to the openness, the possession was visible, right? Because there was testimony that people in fact saw the blue paint that had been used to mark the property line. The people saw it. OK, so that's open, it's visible, they could see. It was also notorious, the court says. Because the community recognized the paint and the fence that was put up as dividing the two parcels. So we've got the openness bit is the idea that, yeah, you can see it, you look around you, it's like it's, it's right out there as opposed to say maybe somebody running a sewer line under underground where you can't actually see it. So open is people could see it. Notorious is people understand this to mean, oh, this is a property line that's making a claim to this here. There are other things that people could have thought when you see a blue line painted on the ground, right, maybe they think, oh, this is for some like, maybe you're training robots or something to see if they can follow the, you know, a painted line or something like that like I don't know. But it turns out in this case, oh, it was notorious, people understood this to be marketing property. All right, so you need both. Um, OK, continuity. Oh, this is Howard versus Kunda. Here we go, more stuff on the board. All right, I gotta draw this out right here. So we got this case, Intermediate appellate court in Washington, 1970, page 175. Um, and one of the upshots of this case is just an example of how adverse possession could be used to fix mistakes. So we got, we got a problem, adverse possession comes in and solves the problem. So I'm gonna draw this out here if you're setting up like some table on your computer, it's like 123, I'm gonna have 5 columns. 3 rows. So we got 3 rows, 5 columns. So first off, we start with some lots. All right. And I'm going to say if it's 4. A, B, C, and D. It's Now, the lots differed in their characteristics, specifically with respect to whether they were improved or unimproved. An improved lot is one that has stuff done to it deliberately to make it better. You know, maybe you've planted a lovely garden in it, or maybe you built a house on it, very common. I played Monopoly. Board game Monopoly, you heard of it? Seriously, hold up your hands if you played Monopoly. OK, all right, I like, you know it's like, I get it. You don't want to be here. I don't care, right? All right, so I was like, wow, all right, um, how many of you here have played Monopoly with the rule that when you land on a property for the first time, if you don't want to buy it, you immediately auction it to the highest bidder. Hold your hands up, seriously. All right. The rest of you are playing Monopoly wrong, and so it's wrong in the sense that actually the game's not as good, but if you read the rules of Monopoly, that's the rule. You'll land on a property for the first time, you don't want to buy it, it immediately gets auctioned off to the highest bidder. Almost nobody plays it that way. Which is an interesting lesson about the law. Right, the rules of monopoly are the rules for a game. They're like the laws for the game, laws for monopoly. They're written down. Nobody learns them by reading them. Everyone learns it from other people. Nobody plays it, and nobody's an exaggeration, but very few people actually play it according to the rule, even though the rule makes the game better. All right, uh, think about that when you think about the law in general. All right. So these lots differ in whether they're improved or not, and why I mentioned Monopoly because since you've all played Monopoly, you'll remember that, you know, you could put houses or hotels on uh, on land. Um, you could buy those, and if you do, you can land on one of the tax things which charges you more for improved property. Improved means as a means you have a house or a hotel. All right, so these lots differed in their improvement status. A and D were unimproved. B and C were improved. OK, so 4 lots, and we've got. Various occupants for each of these. Um, Lot B was occupied by the Kunta. Lot C was occupied by the Moyers. And Lot D was occupied by the hammer. So far, so mundane. There was a problem The problem was that because of a glitch by somebody somewhere, attention to detail people, glitch by somebody somewhere, everybody ended up with the deed to the lot next door. Nobody had the deed to their own actual property, so. So the Kuntos had title to A. The Moyers had title to B. The Howards had title to C. Not an optimal state of affairs now, as it turns out, the Moyers and the Howards then swapped. So then, uh, basically, Um Why I developed aesthetic scruples about that bee at that moment, I don't know, but it was just too ugly, so I had to fix it. All right. So the, uh, as a result of the swap, the Moyers end up with title to C, which is good. Um, and the Howards had title to an improved lot. They're on an unimproved lot. They have title to an improved lot. They end up with title to a different improved lot. Why would they bother doing this? I'm guessing, just speculation on my part, that the Moyers paid the Howards some money. And so now the Moyers are happy because they got title to the lot that they are actually occupying and the Howards, you know, they, they still got title to an improved lot, and they also got some extra money, probably. OK, so good. But obviously we got a problem here. So, naturally, the Kuntos would like to claim that they have ownership, you know, title to B. B is an improved lot. They have a title currently to an unimproved lot, not good, right? They bought a thing that had a house on it, and now they've got something that does, you know, they got title to something that doesn't. All right, so they're going to claim by adverse possession. The case ends up hinging on whether the continuity requirement had been satisfied. Everything else, OK, continuity is going to be dispositive. Why was there a question about continuity? So what was interesting about this case? What was, what was the argument that continuity had not been satisfied here? Uh, Ms. Lee, Um, because it was a vacation house, um, so

SPEAKER 3
the other side argued that, um, because Kuntos was not continuously living in the house, so it was not continuous.

SPEAKER 1
All right, so there's actually two issues. That's one of them. All right. So one of them is that they were only, uh, the Kuntos were occupying the house only during the summer. And That is at least linguistically a problem. Because there are two different words in the English language. We got continue us and continue on. Those two words look pretty similar, they do not mean the same thing. Something is continuous if it happens without interruption. In ordinary language. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, 366 days during leap years, and once every 200 years when we have an extra leap year thing going on. Um, Never ever stops. How many people here have seen the movie Heat? All right, so there's Al Pacino and Heat, right? We're setting up a surveillance operation, right 24/7. We never close, all this stuff. If you haven't seen Heat, check it out. Good movie. Actually worth seeing. Um, long, but we're seeing. Michael Manfell. All right, um, so continuous happens without interruption. Continueual is something that happens over and over and over and over again. Happens repeatedly. So you are continually in this classroom. Cause you are here at least twice a week. Uh, for property, you might have other classes in here as well, but you're at least here for that. But you are not, I hope, continuously in this classroom, right? Um, you, you leave from time to time. Um, as opposed to the Earth is continuously rotating around its axis. It's not like it does it like 3 days a week, every 3 days, like Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, it does. The rest of the time it stops, be very, very bad for life on Earth. Fortunately, it just keeps going, just keeps on spinning. All right, continuous versus continual. This says us continue us doesn't say continue all. So one issue is does continue us in the law of adverse possession. Mean the same thing that continuous means in ordinary language, right? Does it mean without interruption, period. And if so, then we've got a problem here for the kuntos because it was interrupted all the time, they were only there during the summer. All right, there was another continuity issue. A potential problem that arose here. Miss Sebastian Um, was it that the Kundos had just

SPEAKER 4
purchased the land within a year of when, um, the, the, the case began, um, so they actually hadn't been on the land long enough to, um, meet the statutory time in, in the sixth element of adverse possession. So the question was whether the previous owners who had sold them the land could be included in their, um, time period.

SPEAKER 1
Right, so that, uh, you've actually said two things there, both are right, but I just wanna focus on the first part here, just setting up the problem, right? So the problem is the claim is the content's only been there for like about a year. Don't recall what the statute of limitations was in that jurisdiction, but it's gonna be longer than every jurisdiction is longer than a year, Bradford's possession. So assertion is, hey, you, you weren't there continuously for this period of time. You were. Uh, you've only been there for a year now, as Miss Sebastian correctly noted, there'll be an argument, we'll, yeah, we weren't there. We, the Kuntos weren't there for the entire time, but. Somebody other than the true owner. Right, has been there for the entire time. Um, is that enough to satisfy continuity? It's been continuously occupied. But not continuously occupied by the cuntos, right, that's the, so it is, is that enough, right, so we got two issues here. The court addresses both. Um, first up says summer occupancy is good enough. It is OK in this case, because the neighborhood was summer vacation land, summer vacation property in the neighborhood. Summer occupancy thus constituted ordinary use of property of a like nature. In other words, ordinary use of this kind of property. Right, not something I've mentioned before, I expect I will mention it again, the importance of. Looking at the nature of the property in determining what the law is governing that property. Property is the law of things. Stuff There. Um, the, uh, it's a law of various objects that have various characteristics, and maybe the law should differ depending upon what the characteristics are of the thing, and sometimes it does. All right, so here, the court says, look, this is summer property, and so the natural way to occupy summer property is, you know, during the summer. So, this is fine. All right, now with respect to the second issue. the Kuntas were only there for a year. The court says that's OK too, because we are going to allow. Tacking We are going to allow the Kuntos to tack their period of occupancy to the period of occupancy of their predecessor. And you could potentially tack previous, you know, multiple predecessors together, so you can, you know, tacking is like it's just a metaphor, right? Like do you take a tack like a thumbtack and stick two pieces of ribbon together to make the timeline. Um, The court reasons as follows, says, well, tacking is a is a doctrine that's existed for a long time. Uh, so this sort of thing is allowed, but there's a traditional requirement that has to be satisfied. And that is a privity requirement. I'm gonna write privity on the board here just to make sure I'm earning my salary, um. It's teaching. There we are, privity. How many people encountered the term privity before? All right, good. All right, so probably in contracts, I'm guessing. Yeah, all right. So privity is a term that shows up in multiple contexts. The basic idea is just some legally relevant relationship. What the legally relevant relationship is will vary from context to context, right? It's got to be a legally relevant relationship. Now, the court says typically the privity requirement has been satisfied by Privy requirement for tacking has been satisfied by having a deed of changing hands. All right Party X had a deed. Party Y then comes and occupies the property after party X transfers the deed to Y. Then Z comes and occupies the property after Y transfers the deed to Z. So we have a deed changing hands between the various parties, and that existence of that deed that persists amongst all of them provides the necessary privity. Now, obviously there's got to be something wrong with the deed. Because if the deed were perfect, then they just own the property and we're not talking adverse possession. So there's something defective about the deed. But the existence of the deed is the thing that provide, or, you know, ordinarily would provide the required privity. And that's a classic good news bad news situation here. Good news is that there's a deed that changed hands. Great, so looking good for the Kuntos. Bad news is it's a deed to lot a. Oh, not so good, right, so that is kind of problematic potentially under the traditional of you. So the court says, well, we've got to figure out now under this circumstance. Whether it makes sense, you know, what does it take to satisfy privity here? Um, and the court says, well, in order to figure that out, we'll look at the reason why people cared about privity. Why have the privity requirement in the first place? By figuring out the motivation behind the rule, we can then see whether that's relevant to how that applies to the facts before us. And the court says the reason why you cared about privity traditionally is because you want to prevent squatters and trespassers from obtaining rights to property. It just seemed unfair, um, that squatters or trespassers should get that. And you can see intuitively, it does seem odd, right? Somebody's trespassing on some property and then some other random other trespasser comes on and is on it for a week and then suddenly owns it just because there's a bunch of people have been trespassing in the past on the property. It's like, wait, what? Why does that make sense? Right, so the court says basically this thing was to screen out trespassers and squatters from getting ownership, and the Kuntas aren't trespassers, right? They paid money for this thing like they, they thought they owned it, like they were, they weren't doing anything weird about it. It's just like somebody messed up with the deeds. So the court says privity is satisfied, and in general they say privity will be satisfied just so long as there's some reasonable connection. Between the person conveying and the person receiving. That's enough to raise the receiver's claim of right above the status of the wrongdoer or the trespasser. All right So, um, you just have to, it's pretty minimal, right? You just have to have something that's going to elevate them above the status of a wrongdoer, right? And we do, we have that here. right I'm flipping through this here to see what my timing notes are as to when I should take a break. You seem hot enough and also about to go to sleep, so I think that's the warmer, like, so you know, you really want to lower the temperature in the room in order to keep people awake for things, but it looks like an optimal time for a break now, so you can take your 10 minute nap, and when we come back we will talk about adverse hostile underclaimer right, blah blah blah blah blah blah. All right, see you folks in 10.

SPEAKER 0
Oh Um, thank you very much for the, uh. Oh yeah, everything, um, I was curious, and it's not a big deal, but the practice problems, um. There. Um. Oh yeah, good question. I think Like, check the slot. The support like so practice like in week 3, the

SPEAKER 1
practice problems I'm big pick it up pick it up or week 5. The slides, I think may have had answers like information

SPEAKER 0
about answering the practice problems.

SPEAKER 1
Take a look at the slides.

SPEAKER 0
It's not, it's not, it's not a big deal. Like I, I've done this. It's like I figured it out. I don't recall something separate, but if, if there is a, I'm, I'm sure there must be something. If you don't see something in the slides, let me know. I'll see what I can figure out. Perfect. Thank you. You're welcome. quick question. So I just want to clarification on the point. took over the the privity was required to like screen out. Yeah, uh, can you just go over the ground. Yeah, all right, so the, so the idea is with tacking, right, is because I haven't been in there for

SPEAKER 1
a year, let's assume the statute of limitations is section. I'm just making up a numbers 10 years, common year, common life. The one year is obviously not gonna count. Um, but let's suppose that they bought it from somebody who had been there for 28 years. So in that case, Um, you would think that, uh, that the, um, uh, the length of time they've been there should be able to attach on to the length of time that the predecessor had been on. Maybe. The question, can they, can they do that? If they can, then they're good, because that'll be like 29 years, way more than they need. If they can't, they're up a creek. So that's the tacking issue. And the tradition of the doctrine was, is that the those could tack their period of occupation onto the periods of predecessors occupation, but only if there was activity between the predecessor and the country. So tacking is allowed as long as privity exists between the parties that tacking the two links. Does that make sense so far? OK, so the question is then what will satisfy privity? Ordinarily the way you would do it is having a deed changing hands between the two parties, but that's not going to work here because the deeds for the wrong lot. The court could have said, well done on the deed, so here you are, you lose, but it doesn't. It says, well, the reason why we had a privity requirement in the first place is because we just don't want to reward trespassers and squatters. Basically the idea is the vision seems to be like. Adverse possession exists to solve various problems. The problem with this people ending up with some mistake in a deed, like a paperwork error. And so we have this stuff to this exists to make sure that. The legal relationships that are recorded actually match what's going on. But we don't want to be rewarding trespassers, just bad people, you know, squatters, people who know that it's not theirs for just hanging out there, so. we're going to say that you have to have some sort of connection between the subsequent parties, parties. That elevates the relationship beyond that of just being a mere trespasser in school. Doesn't take much. But it's basically screening out trespassers. That makes sense.

SPEAKER 0
OK, yeah, that makes sense. Does that go into like the other kids? I know we didn't talk about carpenter. Yeah, we haven't talked about that yet.

SPEAKER 1
That's a good too, yeah, yeah, we'll, we'll talk about that in a bit. Uh, we'll talk about that right after the break.

SPEAKER 0
Welcome. Yeah Oh right now That's. But. I yeah. I like Trying to do sort of the horror movie

SPEAKER 1
thing, right, where you got the uh the thumping heartbeat, which will then slowly increase in uh in tempo, indicating that, you know, some monsters lurking in the background. Um. Let's get back into this. So I've lost half the class, but, uh, I think I'm, I think I'm at like a 10 minutes here and like, all right, um, they are seeking more temperate climbs, I shall assume. Um, all right, so we get adverse or hostile under claim of right in some jurisdictions, color of title. What on earth is all of that? Well, there's basically two different parts of the requirement. There's the adverseness part and the claim of right part. Um. We'll discuss them in reverse order. All right, so we're gonna talk about claim of right first. Claim a right can be cashed out in 3 different ways in theory, although in practice really there's only 2. And the claim of right. Basically gets to the idea of the state of mind of the party that is adversely possessing. So one possibility is that the party, the adverse possessor must have been possessing in good faith, in a good faith belief that he or she was actually entitled to do that. That is rarely explicitly required. Carpenter versus Roperto is a case, we'll talk a little bit about it, um, that addresses that and does require it explicitly, but that's an outlier. Carpenter is an outlier case, rarely explicitly required. Um, that said, Richard Helmholtz, famous scholar. Um, did an empirical study which seems to suggest that in fact judges actually do care about good faith. So, uh, the presence of good faith or the lack of good faith may in fact affect outcomes even if the law doesn't explicitly say. That they should Um, New York State is one of those jurisdictions in which good faith actually does matter explicitly. This was an issue that was big enough that it showed up on the front page of The New York Times a few times, and in 2008, Albany amended its adverse possession statute to now define claim of right. As quote, a reasonable basis for the belief that the property belongs to the adverse possessor, unquote. The adverse possessor must have in New York a reasonable basis for believing that in fact, it's theirs, good faith. So now explicitly required in New York. This was a big deal. People were like really worked up about the fact that that it seems like, whoa, yeah, the whole adverse possession thing freaks people out, um, for understandable reasons. Uh, a few years ago I had to have some minor surgery and it wasn't a big deal, but it's one of those things, yeah. Had to get pumped full of antibiotics before they would actually do it. So they had me in the pre-op room, um, just lying there on a gurney for an hour while they're giving me a uh antibiotic IV drip, and you got a bunch of uh uh various surgical assistants walking around doing various things there and so you know, so they're, you know, idly chatting with me because I'm just lying there and I say, so what do you do? So I explain my job. And as soon as I did, they got like, really, it's like. Have you heard about this thing called squatter's rights in New York, and then they just started launching into it, they knew people had lost property from this, and they were like, their minds were blown at the fact that adverse possession was actually a thing. Um, and so you can see why people actually might want to say that, look. Something like this, it makes sense, but in a lot of other circumstances it may not make sense and you know, whether it makes sense maybe if the person who's occupying the property is doing so in good faith. They think that it's theirs and they have a reasonable basis for that, but otherwise maybe it doesn't. And to some jurisdictions, but not most. Um, explicitly require good faith. Um, No jurisdiction as far as I know outside of a law school classroom. Follows the main rule, but we always teach the main rule. I don't know why. But it's a property class, so I will teach you the main rule. The main rule supposedly was that bad faith was required. So in Maine, according to a case which I read, I don't think that's actually what the court was doing. The Maine court was doing in 1893 when they handed this thing down, but supposedly they required bad faith. This was famously one of those things that hey, Maine is the only state that requires it and maybe even they don't, and in 1993, they modified their statutes to explicitly not do that. So I think nobody actually follows the Maine rule anymore, um, but it shows up in every law school casebook, so there you are. That's the main rule. That's another possibility. Bad faith is required. And the third possibility which the casebook refers to as the Connecticut rule, although I've never heard it referred to as such outside of the casebook, is that. State of mind doesn't matter. Good faith, bad faith, we don't care. Just doesn't matter. Um, this is the rule that's most favored by commentators. Um, the basic idea is if you have a vision, so one way of thinking about. It's not the only way, but one way of thinking about adverse possession is that basically it is a specialized statute of limitations for actions for the recovery of person of real property, excuse me, real property. So the idea is, you know. I'm, I own Black Acre. Somebody is on Black Acre without permission. Without permission, I can bring a suit to get them off, right? But as you probably know from CVR, uh, that, you know, actions have limits. There are statutes of limitations that place limits on actions, right? Uh you gotta bring your action within a specified period of time, otherwise you lose it, right. Um, and when does that clock start running? Well, typically it's when you have adequate notice of the fact that you might have a viable claim. All right, um, and so on that view, right, this is basically a specialized statute of limitations. It says, yeah, for actions for the recovery of real property, for recovery of possession for real property, then, you know. As long as the possession was done in a certain way that you basically reasonably would have had notice of it, then if you haven't brought your action within the specified period of time, you lose, right? On that view, it doesn't matter what the state of mind is, right, the person who's adversely possessing, it's just irrelevant, right? So you can see why this would be a kind of popular approach to things. But intuitively seems weird to surgical assistants and uh I think a lot of normal people, which is why things end up in The New York Times and New York changes its law. Carpenter versus Rupero is an example of a court that thought that seemed weird. Um, Iowa Supreme Court 1982, page 169. The adverse possessor knew that the lot immediately to the north of hers was not hers, didn't belong to her. The owner, the true owner, was using it just to store junk. There was just junk being kept there. The adverse possessor claimed that she was at least in part worried about rats and other safety risks to her children. Junk breeds rats, things like that. The rats come out and they start nibbling on the kids. That's bad. Rats eating kids really bad. Um, you know, 60, 70 years ago in slums, rat problems were like serious and they would eat kids. So like they want to like devour all the kids, right? But they would bite kids and uh give disease like it was really bad, like not like, not a joke, right? This is, uh, um, uh, rats are not good things. Um, it was very exciting when the Adams administration, uh, here in New York City, uh, a couple of years ago, um, unveiled the amazing discovery of the trash can in which, uh, so New York on the cutting edge of the 19th century here, we've now got trash cans here, Bill, um, but the, the rats are a real problem. OK, so you're concerned about that, she said. So she improved the property north of her. She graded it, yeah, made it flatter, planted grass, and, as one would do if you're worried about rats getting into your kids, installed a propane tank, um, which, man, that joke, I spent literally seconds coming up with that joke, and it's like, um, and it didn't even give me even a mild chuckle. Alright, well, that's because it wasn't good, that's the reason, not good. Um, but, you know, you might think, you might have some doubts about her actual claim. Here what she's actually her actual motivations in doing this, given that she put, you know, the propane tank on the lot directly north of her rather than, uh, you know, doing some other stuff so maybe that's part of what the court's thinking at any rate, the court says, uh, good faith required, she's gonna lose. To allow a squatter to get ownership is to put a premium on dishonesty. Now We haven't talked about it yet, so there's no way you would know it, but, uh, trust me on this, in the future, we will discuss a different thing she could have done if she was really worried just about, uh, her kids getting bitten by rats, and that's the law of nuisance. Would you, how many people are a nuisance and torts? Anyway, OK, good, um, that way it'll be an exciting surprise when we get to it here. Um, it's, uh, basically you can bring an action for people who are doing bad stuff that's interfering with your use of your property. Um, the thing, the catch is if she had brought a nuisance action, the remedy for that is stopping the nuisance would have required the neighbor to get rid of the junk, not have any rats and things like that. It would not have allowed her to place a propane tank on the neighboring property. So this is a situation in which you know the court may well have been thinking we're not gonna let you get away with that. I mean you you just want a place for your propane tank. Um, OK, so that's good faith. Bad faith, so good faith required in some places, bad faith required in Maine once upon a time, except maybe not really, and they probably nowhere now. Um, and then, yeah, it doesn't matter, right? Three different approaches to that. So that's the claim a right bit. Now adverse or hostile. Those two terms you will see used kind of interchangeably like some courts say adverse, some courts say hostile, um, they're both getting at the same idea, no difference in what the actual meaning is, and it's important not to get confused by the words. So what adverse means is that it is contrary, what the adverse possessor was doing was contrary to the rights of the true owner. Contrary to the true owner's legal rights. That's it. That's all it means. What they're doing was contrary to their rights. In practice, what that means is typically the adverse possessor didn't have permission. If the adverse possessor had permission to be there, then being there is not contrary to the true owner's rights, no adverse possession. This is why landlords do not live in fear. Right, um, you are leasing apartments, renting apartments, um, you probably aren't going to be there for the statutory period for New York, uh, unless you have an exceptionally long period of time, uh, in law school, but you know, you might, if you get a job in the city, you might end up, depending on where you're living, you might end up staying there, um, and, uh, maybe did your undergrad in the city, so you might be there for a while, conceivable, and there are a lot of people who are, right, uh, there for a bunch of years. That does not mean that those folks come to own the property through adverse possession. They can't, right, because they're being on that property is by permission of the landlord because of the lease agreement, so it's not adverse to the landlord's rights. OK, so adverse or hostile just means contrary to the true owner's legal rights. Note what it doesn't mean, doesn't mean anything about the state of mind of the adverse possessor. It does not imply animosity or ill will or, you know, so hostile ordinarily sounds like I hate your guts, right? None of that, that's, that's, it's not an optimal term, but it shows up, right? The courts use it, but it just means adverse to their legal rights, right? They can get along great. They could be one, they could be the best buddies in the world, still adverse, right, if it's contrary to the legal rights. Um, Any questions on that so far? All right. Color of title then. So sometimes you will see color of title mentioned in this context. And Different jurisdictions treat color of title differently. Color of title basically means like what does it even mean? Basically means that you're doing it, that you're doing the possession on the basis of like a deed or maybe a judgment that's been handed down, some formal piece of paper. That says that you're entitled to the property. Now, obviously again there has to be something defective about it. Because otherwise then you just own it. Like if, if it's actually a, a deed to the, if it's a completely valid deed to the property, then it's yours, and we're not talking adverse possession. So there's something's gone wrong somewhere in there. But if you're doing it under color of title, that means that you've got some formal piece of paper, typically a deed or maybe a judgment from a court saying, oh, that you're entitled to this. If your adverse possession is done under that, done under color of title. Um, in some jurisdictions doesn't matter at all. They just don't care. Some jurisdictions, only a minority of them, require color of title. No color of title, no adverse possession. In some jurisdictions. Not required, but having it may give you certain advantages. In some jurisdictions, it may make the statute of limitations run faster, so a shorter clock before you become known. In some jurisdictions, Adverse possession under color of title, actual possession of only part of the parcel, may be deemed sufficient to give you um possession, adverse possession of the entire parcel. So recall my black acre example here, 50 acre parcel, 2 acres of which have been occupied and, you know, improved. You got the fence up, the grass, the housing built, and all this other stuff. The rest of it left untouched. If the adverse possessor here. Is acting under color of title in some jurisdictions, the fact that. Only 2 acres have been actually possessed. Is good enough to give that adverse possessor ownership of all 50, all 50 acres of black acre. Yeah, um, New York is one such jurisdiction. So New York Real Property Actions section 512 is titled Essentials of adverse possession Under Written instrument or judgment, so under color of title. All right, and it says the following. Where a known farm or single lot has been partly improved. The portion of the farmer lot that has been left not cleared or not enclosed according to the usual course and custom of the adjoining country is deemed to have been occupied for the same length of time as the part improved and cultivated, unquote. All right, so New York says if you got a farm or a single lot that's partly improved, the unimproved bit will be deemed to have been occupied for the same period of time as the improved bit. Um, because this is the section on things done under color of title. Now one other interesting thing to just note about that statute there is that this is an example of a statute that explicitly relies on custom to figure out what the content of the law is, right? It says a lot that has been left not cleared or not enclosed according to the usual course and custom of the adjoining country. By country doesn't mean the United States, right? It just means like that that part of the state, right, um, so there in order to fill out the meaning of what it is to be enclosed or improved, it just relies on custom explicitly says, OK, what, what is the custom in this area for like do people understand that to be enclosed or do they think that's not enough, all right, which is kind of interesting. Um, Scott versus Anderson Tully in addressing in stating this year, they say claim of ownership, this is the term that they use, noted earlier that the language varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and then also says that the acts required to establish a claim of adverse possession may vary with the characteristics of the land. Acts that are insufficient for developed or improved land may be enough for unimproved or wild land. So the fact that Anderson Tully didn't actually improve the land in question in this case isn't an obstacle here because you know it's just woods, woodland, right? Um, so basically thinking about it in a context like New York, right, the rules for what would be good enough. In upstate New York, out in the middle of nowhere, may be different from what's good enough in Midtown Manhattan. Um, All right, and so in, in the, in Scott versus Anderson Tully, Anderson Tully didn't seek permission, so no permission, so. Don't have to worry about that. And uh they were the only ones to use the disputed tracks of tracks, it was OK. It was contrary to the uh um to the rights of the true owner. OK, good enough. Um, before I forget, I'm gonna just pause right now and ask. Uh, on a completely unrelated note, are there empty seats routinely in the back of this classroom or not? Like, are there empty seats in this classroom? There are some? OK, good. The reason why I'm asking is because I got an email from. Somebody in the administration. And I guess, OK, so get ready to feel old. The next generation of law students is, uh, uh, gonna be coming and doing visits, uh, at, uh, Columbia to be checking, checking out the place. And so, um, they're checking to make sure that, uh, it's OK for somebody to sit in on the classroom. I just wanna make sure there's seats, all right, so you are already. So good news is you are now experienced law students. Bad news is there are people who are younger, faster, more up to date on the current technology coming in to replace you. All right, um. Alright, element 6 for the statutorily required period of time. So there's two issues that arise here. One is how long must the clock run. And that issue is straightforward. It's just look it up. It varies among jurisdictions. It's written in a statute. It's just look it up in your jurisdiction. Varies from the shortest end 5 years, the longest end 40 years as best I know. New York, 10 years. All right, so that's just look it up. Now there's an interesting other doctrine, um that uh relates to this, which is what can suspend the running of the clock, uh, what can toll the statute. Um, there are disabilities rules for tolling the statute that appear in the casebook and page 181, according if I wrote down the page number correctly. Um, these are basically rules for suspending the running of the clock, so stopping the clock, right, if the true owner is suffering from a disability, that would prevent the true owner from basically bringing like detecting what's going on or bringing a claim or something like this. Classic types of disability would be infancy. If you're a little kid, that you know, you can't actually um like bringing lawsuits and things like that. But also like maybe being in a coma or something like that. Now, one thing, key rule here for the suspending of the running of the statute is that the disability will have that effect only if it existed at the time the adverse possession began. If the disability arises later, it has no legal effect. If the true owner went into a coma the day before the adverse possession began. Statute, the running of the statute is suspended until he comes out of the coma. If the true owner went into a coma the day after the adverse possession began, no effect whatsoever. Why does this make sense? I don't have the faintest idea. It puzzles the heck out of me. I, I just, I, at some point I gotta try to figure it out, and so, you know, when something seems utterly crazy, right, uh. The hack way of dealing with it is go, oh this seems utterly crazy, and then you write something, say, hey, this seems utterly crazy and everyone goes, yeah, I guess it does. Um, the better way of dealing with those things is try to make it make sense. Try really, really hard to come up with an argument that will make it make sense, and maybe you can pull it off, and if so, great, and if you can't, well then at least you're confident that it really just doesn't make sense. But then you've got to ask the question. Why is it that the rule was made in the first place? Like what went wrong? Give me, give me the account of why it is we have this rule that in fact makes no sense. I don't have answers to any of those questions. I talked to somebody famous, much smarter than I am about this. This person was equally puzzled by the doctrine. It just doesn't seem to make sense. So there's got to be something interesting going on there, but I have no idea what it is. All right, any questions on this? So the doctrinal stuff here, yeah.

SPEAKER 5
For that rule that you just discussed, could it be that like the rightful owner wouldn't have the opportunity to object to somebody trying to claim rights on their land because they like wouldn't be able, if they were in a coma, they wouldn't be able to, to like have a discussion with the person or tell them it's their property. So that makes, I, I perfectly get why having, why

SPEAKER 1
you would suspend the running of the statute, um, for a disability. Alright, that makes sense to me. I don't get why it is that the disability must have existed at the time the adverse possession began.

SPEAKER 5
Because then they could never re they could never reject the, the possession, right?

SPEAKER 1
statute of limitations in New York is 10 years. Alright, you own some property and uh, let's make, uh, I own the property, so I'm gonna be the one who's going in the coma there. I don't wanna put you in a coma. Um, you might already be in a coma in this class, but that's all right. Um, yeah, you're in good company here. It's hot. It's like it's been a long, it's been a long winter. It's adverse possession. I don't know, yeah. It's crazy. It's a crazy doctrine, right, um, the, um, uh, so, uh, I am the true owner. You start adversely possessing it. I, you're, I'm the true owner. I own some property and, uh, you know, it, it's kind of some farmland, right? I live 150 miles away, right? I check, I am diligent. I check my property once a week. I go over there and I check it out. I check it out every Friday. Right, you start adversely possessing the property on Sunday. On Monday, I go into a coma. According to this doctrine, the fact that I am in a coma has no effect on the running of the statute of limitations. I may be in a coma for 15 years. When I wake up, they say, good news and bad news. Good news, you're no longer in a coma. Bad news, you've been out for 15 years, and by the way, adverse possession started about 18 hours before you went into the coma, so you've lost your farm. Yeah, that just seems weird to me. That just seems weird to me. Um. Uh, but presumably there's some reason. I mean, it's in there, right? Somebody thought it was a good idea. Everything in the law is there because somebody thought it was a good idea. I just don't know what it is. All right. Um, let's talk about adverse possession more generally, right, so. Um, How many people here think that it makes perfect sense for their uh for the law to have an adverse possession doctrine? Alright, how many people do you think that it seems kooky, crazy, bizarre to have an adverse possession doctor? Alright, and the rest of you are dead. Alright, um, the, um, alright, well, fair enough, um. All right, so let's say somebody who thinks that it makes sense. Why? So like what's a, what's an argument for this? Uh, is it Ms. Chalapa?

SPEAKER 6
I mean, specifically thinking in the context of New York City, I think in my like role in the city like before coming to law school, I've seen the way it's like saved people from becoming homeless. So I think this still has like practical effects in a world of like increasing wealth inequality for people to have some way to assert like rights to, um, I mean, in a world of increasing renters to have rights. To private property that most people really can't afford.

SPEAKER 1
That's interesting. Can you just elaborate a bit like on how like examples of like how this actually worked to uh keep somebody from becoming homeless? Yeah, I think it might have changed, but the squatters'

SPEAKER 6
rights law in New York City is that like if you're in a place, I think at least it was at the time, like more than 30 days, then you have um rights that you can assert in court to not get evicted like immediately. Um, and a lot of these people themselves were disabled or themselves had like very low paying jobs. So like often were priority targets from landlords to get out of their building because they weren't making any money off of them. Um, but at the same time, they would have been homeless if they'd been kicked out. So, I think like it served as a defense. Like a lot of times it was just like knowing that these rights existed. Um, allowed them to like stay there enough that they can find another place or like ward off, you know, the worst impacts of like a really imminent eviction.

SPEAKER 1
All right, so interesting. Now I will note that New York housing law is a world unto its own and so there's a whole bunch of statutes and regulations and things that are not sort of common law adverse possession stuff there. So maybe good, maybe bad, um, but whatever it is, it's probably, uh, just be aware of the fact that we'll talk about leases later on in the course, um, but again we're gonna be talking about the common law of leases, so it's not really gonna be useful for you in New York if you want to like litigate anything. Uh, talk to your classmates who know far more about this than I do, but just be aware that there are complications with those things. The, um, the people that you were talking about there were these people who had had leases and then, uh, lost them. Right, OK, so, right, so, OK, so interesting, yeah, so there are, uh, there is, the reason why I'm asking that is that there's a doctrine, so if you, um, this is by way of preview for leases. If you, um, uh, stay over in your lease, you have a one-year lease, and then the one year ends and you just stay over in it under, I have no idea how it works in New York, right, that again, New York housing law, world of its own, but, um, the standard common law. Uh, rule is that then you become what's called a tenant at sufferance. We'll talk about this later, so you, you don't, don't worry about memorizing it now. And the basic idea of being a tenant at sufferance is that you are deemed to be there with permission, and because you're deemed to be there with permission, you are not adverse. And so therefore adverse possession is not going to apply. But again, New York, world of its own. OK, so uh yeah.

SPEAKER 7
Um, I think it makes sense from a I think the book talked about this, but it makes sense from the logistical standpoint of what do you do after 50 years and how do you like sort through the evidence, um, of having multiple claims of ownership to a piece of land, um, like possibly multiple mortgages, so I think it makes sense to have some kind of, um, doctrine. That just like erases the past at some point and kind of like lets you continue forward. This is like a little bit of a funky doctrine, but I guess it makes the most sense to solve that problem. All right, so one thing, um, so a good point.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, the, the case book does mention this, um, you could think of this as an evidentiary problem. You could also think of it maybe as a title clearing problem, but the basic idea is. Um, it does make sense that property lasts a long, long time, right? Real property lasts a long, long time. So it's potentially, it's possible you could have people who have claims that are really, really old and they want to enforce them now. Sometimes this is referred to as the deed in the attic problem. So you think you've bought some property and you're in there and you're owning it and you're doing your thing and then somebody knocks on the door one day and you answer the door and the person says, hi, I was just going through the storage unit of my great aunt Matilda and I discovered a deed from 1928 that gives me ownership of this property. And you know, maybe the deed is actually valid, but at this point, you know, it's like if you're going to buy land, like do you want to be in a situation in which you have to worry about that sort of thing happening? And there are various statutes that now try to deal with this with the recording acts, things, but the basic idea is with all these things is we're we're gonna take, we're gonna look back at a certain period of time. And then after that we're just going to sweep away everything, all right, um, and related to the title clearing aspect is the evidentiary aspect, right? Showing who actually, you know, finding the facts about what happened 10 years ago can be, you know, maybe doable, a little challenging, but maybe doable, but 2030 years ago may well just be lost in the mist of time. So it makes sense maybe just from an efficiency standpoint to just say, you know what? After a certain period of time, that's it. You, you can't complain about it anymore. It relates to the statute of limitations view, which is the standard justification for statutes of limitations, right, is that evidence gets stale and you can't get it and so therefore that's why we got just cut off claims even if they would be otherwise completely valid. All right, somebody who doesn't, who's skeptical of adverse possession, give me an argument, yeah.

SPEAKER 8
Yeah, I just like. I have always found squatters, right? It's particularly interesting, especially in New York. The climate is just and the housing crisis just, it's just so bad that I, I see the. They, uh, the credence in that, but I come from people who like haven't always had a lot of liquid, but they've had a property, and that's sometimes like the only thing they have. So on the, the kind of the inverse of what, uh, Romy was saying, I think, um, it really kind of can disadvantage, I mean, barring the time limit, like I get it, 10 years, OK, but like it can kind of disadvantage like these same like black and brown underserved populations as like someone can just post up in your house and say I'm not leaving. Like, like my family has a house like I commute from there. And we have tenants on the top two floors and like I think they should be kicked out but like I think there's a genuine concern about like like when their lease ends um about like what I'll let them say so then um about like the rights of like tenants in New York because like I don't know they've been there for a while or whatever so yeah but I don't think like that should be like a fair thing for us to be concerned about that like a house that we own can be taken over by people who have a right here because they had a lease like what so yeah.

SPEAKER 1
All right, so there's, uh, I, once again this is probably just the bad place to ask this question because you folks know about like New York City is so sui generis my understanding with respect to its housing law, um, and they maybe places like San Francisco are kind of similar in some ways, but, um. That, uh, that's, I think, influencing a lot of people's, uh, take on this sort of common law stuff. If we're teaching this in Nebraska, probably be different, right? People think about farmland and things like that. Well, you got a bunch of acres of farmland and what are the pros and cons on it, um, but all right, interesting other perspective on this here too. So there might be ways in which it just like it seems bad to be vulnerable in this way. So one thing it does, it places, um, a burden on property owners to be. You know, routinely monitoring their property to check to see if something's going on, and if they find something that's going on, then they have to go to court and bring a lawsuit and go to the. They have to pay lawyers, right, not cheap, and you have to go to a lot of work in order to protect themselves from losing their property, which is going to be a burden too, yeah.

SPEAKER 2
You're fine. Um, I was just going to say like my family does have farmland actually in Nebraska but also um in Texas and like especially when there's like a lot of acreage and like my grandparents which both of the properties are grandparents like they themselves don't have the like capability really to. You know, go out and survey all of the acreage and stuff. Meanwhile, if like corporations or these like mega farms move in, it's, I feel like it's gotten a lot more complicated where kind of like how we saw in the Scott case that they were able to market and then start like, you know, using the timber and stuff by using this property line. But if they're not going, I'm not saying it was the case, but like for example, if my grandparents couldn't like go out and survey the land all the time, would they even like be able to notice that and like the resource differences also just kind of makes me like not really like the doctrine.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, so there's an issue that can arise with people as they get older, all right, so, um, this is very top of mind for me because like I spent like 2 hours last night reading a book. Who will take care of me when I get old, um, because I, I, I'm not, not married and I don't have kids, and so I'm like I'm kind of, it's like, oh, a lot of people are in this like increasing, uh, percentage of the population are in this, uh, situation, and, uh, it get, it, it gets hard, right? And so it's like it's worrisome and so like I'm like I'm kind of freaked out about it, but like what are you gonna do? I'm, I'm old, it's too late to fix things, uh, I don't know, um, the, uh, so this is an issue, right? Um, uh, what happens, uh, when, uh, uh, and even if you're not old, right, maybe you just get sick. Right, or maybe you just got other things going on, right? You just got a bunch of stuff that you're dealing with, um. 15 years ago or so, I don't, I don't, I don't know, some time ago, I went home to visit my parents and the house I grew up in, and I saw that the driveway that I had been used to because that's where I grew up had now had a sort of fence that was like kind of encroaching on the driveway and um I asked my parents, well, what's up with that? And they said, well, the neighbors had a, uh, did a survey. They had a survey done and it turns out that the property line that we thought was a property line, I guess wasn't, so it's this other place so then so they then put a fence there like, well, I think you might have a valid adverse possession claim here because you've been there for decades, um, and my parents were like, nah, I'm not gonna bring them and for a couple of reasons that I think are interesting. One is they were old, candidly, they were old, and it just was too much for them to try to vindicate their rights on that. Um, that happens. Another thing was also, I think they just thought it was unneighborly. It's like, you know, it wasn't our land. We benefited from it for a while and that's it. So you know, we're not going to do anything about it. Most property disputes in the world, in the United States, are just settled by people working things out. You know, it's not going to court. This is extremely all the stuff we do here is extremely unusual. These are things in which people have actually gone to court. Typically you've got even an appeals court ruling on it, very, very small slice of things. Most people just work things out and so you can worry about adverse possession and that the extent, you know, you want to make sure that the doctrine is not structured in such a way that it discourages people from just working things out. And you need to worry about people for whom, you know, various burdens can get placed on them because they need to now do various things to protect losing against their rights. On the other hand, that said, you know, there are benefits to it too, like for the kunta, like this adverse possession worked to treat here, right? This basically solves a problem which there's a mistake in which everybody ended up with the wrong deed. But you can figure it out and like, OK, we now got a clean way of just sorting this thing out and give everybody the deed to the property they thought they had bought in the first place and everything's good. Um, there are also other justifications I'll just mention uh this one of the standard ones that's given to is that people just come to rely on things after time, after they've been on there for a decade or whatever, they've just come to think of it as their own and they've come to rely on and they've become so psychologically attached that if you. Tear it away from them, they'll feel miserable, and Oliver Wendell Holmes in addressing this, raises the possibility that people might actually maybe get violent, if you take it away from them, right? Cause they're used to having it. Um, your first like property that's been held for a long time as well as opinions that have been held for a long time. You come to actually be so wedded to them that if somebody like tries to take them away from you, then you get, uh, they lash out. So that's another standard justification that's given for this. But you know, you can ask the question, perfectly reasonable question, why should those psychological concerns actually matter? It's like, hey, you've been trespassing for a decade. So you've come to rely on the fact that you've been trespassing for a decade. You've liked trespassing for a decade. Therefore, we'll protect that, huh? It's like, OK, you know, just be happy you got away with it that long, right? So there is, uh, there's a well-known paper, um, uh, written on adverse possession called The Uneasy Case for Adverse possession, which I think is what most people's attitude is toward this. It's like, well, you know, the document has some uses, but also has some real question marks on it. All right, any questions on this? Great. When we come back next class, we will talk about body parts and ownership thereof. Have a great
