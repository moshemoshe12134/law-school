That he also apply to the admissions office? Oh, sorry.

SPEAKER 1
to Lower your expectations. Thank you very much. I apologize for the late arrival. It's uh. Uh, one of those days, sort of, um, including, so like I can't get, couldn't actually get in the building, but. They didn't let me in anyway. This thing I'm supposed to be like it's only got two buttons, right? Like how can, how can I mess this up, right? I'm clicking on the point down thing. Like I was like. Oh, there, OK, you gotta go to the side, yeah, who knows, um. So, uh, yeah, so I'm sorry for the late arrival. I had a doctor's appointment this morning. Nothing contagious, don't worry, um, and, uh, I was sitting around there for an hour. It took them an hour before they would actually see me, so that, uh, kind of threw my schedule off, but it did give me plenty of time to think about sitting in line. So when you're in a doctor's office, right, you're sitting in a line, and I gather what the problem was, was basically because of the weather, lots of people were coming, showing up late. People had appointments ahead of me and uh. This is a doctor that has a completely crowded schedule, so if they just canceled the appointment, it might be months before she could see somebody again. All right, so they don't want to do that. So they're seeing people even though they arrive late. All right, so here's a just a question for you. I don't know what the answer is. I think it's a distributive justice question. So given that you have a bunch of people with places in line to see a doctor. And a bunch of the early people have shown up late. Um, I showed up on time but it didn't do me any good because I had to wait an hour, um, and you want to reschedule those people. What, what's the optimal thing to do? So I think what they did is they just saw people, sort of the earlier people in the order in which they actually showed up and then pushed everybody else back. So that's one thing you could do, but then that means that the people who showed up on time end up having to wait an hour. Another thing you could do is take the people who missed their earlier appointments and just put them at the end of the day. But maybe that's not going to work for them. I mean, that means they're going to be sitting around for like 6 or 8 hours to wait for an appointment. Um, maybe you could interleave the people, right? So you take one person who meets on time and then one person who's who missed their appointment and then one person who was there on time person who missed the appointment. What's the optimal way of doing that? I don't know. I didn't come to an answer to that. We're just when you start thinking about it, everything in life gives you an opportunity to think about institutional design. And so, um, that's how I spent my morning. Then rushing back to my apartment to get changed into a suit and come up here. So, uh, that was not interesting, but it was my day, so there you have it, um. All right, today, what are we talking about? Oh yeah, first we're going to start to recap the last class. So we began by considering the question of how it is that one can acquire property legitimately. One of the most seemingly straightforward ways of doing that is by first possession, to be the first to acquire something that no one had previously owned. But even that simple idea turns out to be complicated in practice. We began by discussing that in the context of Pearson against Post. The fox case, right? Um, we have wild animals in the wilderness. If you capture them, you own them. Ownership goes to the first possessor. Your food is done, right, microwave ding there. Um, but that then raises the question of what constitutes first possession. So the case involved a plaintiff would pursue a fox only to have the defendant step into the last minute and seize it, carry it away, and we spent some time discussing the question of whom the law should give ownership to. And one of the ideas that came out of that discussion is that it's important to try to figure out what the purpose of allocating rights to foxes is in the first place. What are we trying to accomplish in order then to be able to figure out what rules make sense. To accomplish that goal. And we noted the majority in the dissent in Pearson had different visions of what the law should be trying to accomplish. What's the name of the game? The rule, um. For back up, the majority thought that the object of the game, the purpose, the function that is being served by allocating ownership of foxes is to avoid disputes and preserve certainty. The dissent thought that the object was to preserve incentives for fox hunting, incentives for productive activity, we might say more generally. The difference in visions of what the law should be, what the law should be trying to accomplish, then led to different answers for what it was that the specific rule should be. The majority thought that in order to achieve possession, qualify legally as having attained possession. For hunters, you need to have mortally wounded the animal and not broken off pursuit. If you're a trapper, you need to have deprived the animal of its natural liberty and made escape impossible. Livingston, the descent would have required only demonstrated intent to convert the animal to the pursuer's use, plus either the animal was within reach or the pursuer had a reasonable prospect of capturing it. That is an easier test for pursuers to satisfy, but it is less certain what constitutes a reasonable prospect of catching it. The majority in the dissent also disagreed about what the proper source of the rule should be governing. Ownership of foxes. The majority looked to legal theorists and passed case law. The dissent thought that it might be better to consult a tribunal of people who are engaged in that enterprise, tribunal of sportsmen in this case. In Gen v. Rich, we return to that question of how should the rules be determined in which we've got a conflict over what rules should apply. Should the common law apply or should custom apply? And the court applied custom to resolve the dispute, setting aside the common law. Um, the court thought that the custom, and you know, list of various reasons why this made sense, seems to work well in practice. People sort of relied on it. Uh, stakes aren't really high because it doesn't affect that many people and so forth, but we talked about some reasons why custom might also have disadvantages, why that might not be the optimal way of picking the answer. OK, today we are going to start by talking about um some problems with first in time. We've been talking about first in time systems and the question is then who qualifies as first? OK, suppose we get that sorted out one way or another. Uh, we're now allocating rights to people who get it first, to get the thing first. That has some advantages, but it also has disadvantages. Um, there are problems that can arise when any when a resource that is owned in common or is not owned by anybody, right, just a common access resource is one that then belongs to whoever is the first to take it. This is sometimes referred to as the common pool problem, sometimes referred to as tragedy of the commons. We have the Eleanor Ostrom reading, which is a, you know, a snippet of what she wrote, um, that talks about this. Um, this is on page 65 for governing the Commons, excerpts from her book. Uh, Ostrom, by the way, historical note, received the Nobel Prize for Economics, uh, in 2009 for her work on the Commons. She shared it with Oliver Williamson. Both, uh, Ostrom and Williamson are well known as, uh, founders of a. School among the founders of a school of economics known as the new Institutional Economics. So if you thought that the Ostrom reading was really interesting, you might be interested in reading more stuff from the new institutional economics folks. Uh, Ostrom, by the way, is the first woman ever to receive an Economics Nobel. She starts by talking, or our excerpt starts by talking about um the tragedy of the commons and setting it out, and she mentions the classic nowadays, uh, treatment of this, Garrett Hardin's discussion of the tragedy of the commons from 1968. Um, Example, standard example it's given is ranchers in a common field, right? So you're a rancher, you raise cattle. Right, um, and cattle need to eat grass or they die. Cattle feed on grass. Where do they get the grass? Well, you might have a giant field that's just open to anybody. You can go and graze your cattle. How many people here have done the tragedy of the Commons pre in previous. All right. Yeah, people are like shy about admitting that they know anything here. We are, we're living in the era in which, you know, um, it's better to be, it's better to seem dumb than to seem smart, which just seems bad to me, you know, it's OK to know things. It's all right. OK, so some of you have done this before, so great, for some of you will be reviewing for other folks, uh, this will be new. All right, so the setup here is we got a bunch of ranchers. They own some cattle, so this is not a system in which all property is owned in common, right? It's just they, they own the cattle, they own individual cattle, but the grass is in common, right? Everybody has a right to do it. Um, what is a potential problem that's going to arise here? So what is likely to happen when we've got a situation in which everybody owns their own cattle and they can feed their cattle on this common pool of grass? What is likely to happen? What is the likely feeding behavior, cattle feeding behavior that's going to happen here? I don't have the seating chart yet, so again I'm just gonna be rude and just point. All right, why? Everyone will be incentivized to just let the cattle loose and eat as much as they want. Why not, why not, why not restrain yourself from having your cattle just go out there and eat everything? They don't have any responsibility to cattle. OK, so you do want your cattle to eat the most. So all everything you said is right, right? You want your cattle to eat the most, so go out there and have the cattle eat, right? Um, suppose that there is somebody who is highly virtuous. So for instance, I am not going to have my cattle be greedy. I am going to restrain myself. We are going to eat only moderate amounts of grass and then we're gonna stop. Um, what happens with respect to that person, yeah. Everybody else overgrazes their cattle, so then that person doesn't get a quote unquote fair share. They're disadvantaged by being virtuous. Yeah, so if you refrain, you don't benefit in any way from refraining, right? All that happens is that there's now more grass for the other people who are grazing their cattle to the maximum, uh, to eat. All right. So the result is there's no real incentive not to graze your cattle to the maximum extent. Now, presumably cattle have a certain, like a cow, like they got multiple, they got multiple stomachs, right? Cows have like multiple stomachs, I think, a lot of them. But ultimately there's a finite grass capacity for whatever that is. But if you're a rancher, you might be planning on selling your cattle to be slaughtered, right, to be turned into beef, right? So it might behoove you then to just get a bunch of cattle. And have them go out there and get maximize the number of cattle that you can have and have them go out there and eat the grass before it's all gone, um, so that you maximize the benefit to you. All right, so a bit of law and economics terminology here which we're going to introduce, mentioned this a class or two ago, said we'd get to it later and so later is now. Um, some terminology that's used here in this context is internalization and externalization of costs and benefits, right? And internalized benefit is one that you actually experience, that a decision maker experiences. So decision maker has to make a choice, right? Facing a choice, do X or Y or Z, right. The benefits that the decision maker will experience himself or herself as a result of the choices. That he or she makes are benefits that are internalized. Right, those consequences that the decision maker does not experience himself or herself, that exist, but other people experience instead, those are externalized. They're external to the decision maker. Standard law and economics reasoning is this people are rational decision makers, and this is like the super simple version of it, right? Uh, pros in law and economics actually complicate these models all the time, right? But the basic idea is people are by and large rational decision makers. And they will make choices based on assessing the benefits of each option and assessing the costs of each option, but in doing so they assess the benefits to themselves and the costs to themselves. The internalized costs and benefits factor into their decision. The externalized costs and benefits they don't care about because they don't experience, right, so those do not factor in their decision. Um, this then can give rise to potential problems if choice A has a lot of benefits that the decision maker will make. But a lot of cost will be experienced only by other people. Or alternatively, option C has a lot of costs that will be experienced only by the decision maker, but a huge amount of benefits to everybody else that the decision maker doesn't make. Not going to choose option C, probably choose option A. All right, that's, that's a problem. OK, so then we're gonna have to figure out how to deal with that and there's various ways of doing this, and we'll talk about this more later. Um, um. Vast literature on this here using that lingo, that sort of technical apparatus to talk about the tragedy of the commons, the problem is that when we have a common resource like grass, you've got a bunch of ranchers there, ranchers cannot internalize the benefits of forbearance of not grazing all the grass because if the grass isn't eaten by their cattle, it'll just be eaten by somebody else's, right? They don't get any benefit from refraining. Looking at the flip side. I love this, um. Where does grass come from? Well, it comes from grass seeds. So one thing you could do if you're worried about the grass being entirely depleted is plant more grass. You can do that, but that's costly, right? You got to pay for the seed. You got to pay for the labor to go out there and spread the seeds around. All right. The the costs of planting more grass are internalized entirely by whichever rancher decides to be nice and do that. But the benefits cannot be internalized, fully internalized by that person, because anybody else can then just come and eat the grass, right? So that means planting grass is a losing proposition. If you're rational, you're not going to do it. Um, refraining from eating grass is also a losing proposition. If you're rational, you're not going to do it. The net result is you have incentives to go out there and have all your cattle eat all the grass and never plant any new. The result is all the grass gets eaten, nothing replaces it. Voila, we've got a catastrophe. We've got a tragedy. The field is now completely wiped out of grass. OK, how to deal with that. Right, um. Oh, sorry. Two other notes. So if that, uh, all right, so we're talking about cattle and these sorts of things. Anyone here from cattle country? Anyone here like ranch? No? All right. All right, all right. What state are you from? I'm from Texas. Oh, OK. All right. And are you, is your family in the ranching business? Um, my grandparents had cattle. OK, all right, good. Well, more, more than I can say. All right, um, all right, uh, so you know, this is, so if I, if I were teaching in like Wyoming or something, this would be a big deal for a lot of you, but maybe, maybe not so intuitive for many of you, um, but you've probably gone to student events in which either, I don't know if they have them at the, the law school here, but they almost only did at your undergraduate institution. In which free pizza is offered. Alright, um, what happens if you arrive at the free pizza event 15 minutes after it's started? How much pizza are you likely to get? Very little in my experience. Um, routinely, you get there at the very beginning and yeah, there are people who are grabbing slices of pizza and then there are people who are doing the two paper plate things, right, where you can get like 2 or 3 slices and you stack them and they turn the other paper plate on top of it. I once was, I don't remember where it was, but I remember being at an event or like walking past an event in which I saw a dude literally walking out with two. Boxes of pizza. Hey, it said free, didn't say a limit. Out he goes. All right, so that's the free pizza problem, right? There's no benefit to you to forbearing from taking the pizza. Um, you're certainly not going to pay to provide more pizza, so the pizza like disappears super quickly, right? And people will take more pizza than they probably really need or maybe even want because it's free and it's right there and there's no point waiting. Um, this has been noted, so, uh, Garrett Hardin's treatment of the tragedy of the commons is the most famous treatment of it, but he was not the first. H. Scott Gordon noted the same phenomenon in the context of fisheries in I think 1954. Um, uh, and he noted the problem that you can have overharvesting of fish in fisheries. Fisheries are like places where fish are out in the sea, right, and nobody owns the ocean. And you've got a problem if you have that because you take out too many fish, and then there's no mommy and daddy fish there that can make a little baby fish, and so you have no fish, right? This is today a major problem in the world's oceans. Overfishing of fishing areas is a big deal. Um, about 1015 years ago, I forget exactly when, there was a bunch of news about Somalia and pirates, piracy off Somalia. Somalia piracy ended up becoming a different thing from what it was when it started. But when it started, it was the locals in Somalia who were attempting to protect their fishing grounds from people from completely other parts of the world who were just coming in and slurping up their fish. Later turned into something very different, um, and it was a major problem until Tom Hanks went and solved it apparently. Um, but, uh, uh, so he did his thing though, so now we don't worry about it. But this is a big problem today. There are fancy fish. Engineering is amazing on these things, fancy fishing ships. Uh, uh, engineering is amazing on these things. Basically they have. Like giant vacuum cleaners and they just like scoop up massive amounts of water and everything that's in it and the machines and the blades and they chop up the fish and they process it on the ship. And they just, and there are these ships that literally will travel to the other side of the globe and just go around and just slurp up fish. All right. And that's a problem. All right, how do you deal with that? And talk to your international law people. Um, if you're looking, if this topic interests you at all, there is. IUU, um, this stands for illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, right, um, and there's a lot of literature on IUU fishing and interesting questions about what to do, uh, with it. By the way, if you're interested in international law stuff at all, you pick the right law school to go to. Boy, uh, Columbia has a legendary reputation for international law stuff, so you might wanna look it up. OK, so this is a big problem. It is a big problem in general, how you deal with the tragedy of the commons. Ostrom notes various solutions that you could propose, and oh, I forgot, today it's just I'm forgetting things and I'm looping back. One other thing I want to say, the tragedy of the commons we've been talking about is, uh, as we've been talking about it, it involves taking stuff out of, you know, the common field or the pizza box or whatever it is. But you can also have the tragedy of the commons working the other direction. Pollution, dumping things into the commons. You got a factory, it emits a bunch of smoke. Well, the smoke, the wind's going to blow the smoke over somebody else, so we don't internalize those costs. We don't care. We'll just dump it in the atmosphere and companies do that or dump chemicals into rivers or anthropogenic global warming, right? You've got the companies that are spewing out lots of carbon dioxide or other activities that spew out lots of carbon dioxide. Right, uh, this all goes into the atmosphere and the net result is bad, but nobody internalizes all those costs, so it's like whatever, we'll just do it. OK, so you can get, um, pollution is can be another example of a tragedy of the common just going in the other direction. You can see there's a vacant lot in the city, right, that just gets filled up with trash because people just throw the stuff in there and nobody cleans it up. All right, how to deal with this? Ostrom notes that there are various solutions that have been proposed, and the punch line for all of this stuff, all the new institutional economic stuff, is there's no easy answers to things, right? Um, new institutional economic economists are really, really interested in the question of what institution, how to optimally design institutions to solve various problems, and one of their ideas, recurring ideas, is that there is no one size fits all. Answer to that. You've got to figure out the optimal institution for the particular problem you're dealing with here, and there are trade-offs for any choice you make. It's all about trade-offs. All right, so here, one possibility, one way of dealing with these sorts of problems is we could have state control. Ostrom points out we could have a central planner who decides what should be done. by whom, in a pollution context, we could have somebody, a regulator that steps in and says you may not emit more than X, you know, uh, quantity x of some chemical or carbon dioxide or whatever. In the grazing context, we might have somebody say you are entitled to have your cattle eat. Three bales of hay or whatever it is, it's hay, grass, I don't know, whatever. I grew up in the suburbs. It's all concrete to me. Um, the, um, um, uh, you know, they have a central planner just says this is the way we're going to do it, right? Um, and this will achieve coordination. We can get resources that are used optimally by having somebody sort out who's going to do what. Right and direct each person to do the thing and then everything's coordinated and we're good, solves the problem. Alright, um. To get fancy, Ostrom refers to Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, right? You may have read that in college or if you have a PhD, you may have written your dissertation on it, whatever. You're probably familiar with Leviathan. All right, uh, so the idea of you need a central authority, the absolute monarch in in Hobbes, that is going to impose order on bank. OK, has some pluses, seems kind of attractive. I gather it's popular on TikTok now. Uh, this kind of thing, it's like, oh yes, uh, the youth like this idea. All right, well, you know, there are obvious advantages to it. Sometimes it works pretty well, but not always. There are problems. Now one problem that Ostrom. Mentions for it, and I think it's true, but I think it's a little bit misleading is that it is inherently coercive, and that is true. Central planning is inherently coercive. The thing is, I'm not sure that coercion isn't really needed for pretty much any of the options that one could do. So it may be that like coercion. Everywhere and so maybe that's not a really distinguishing problem with this, but she identifies another problem which is one of the standard problems of central planning, um, that is, I think that at least for me resonates a little more right and this is a problem that is, um, uh, referred to as a standard term referring to this is the knowledge problem. It is, I think that phrase was coined by, certainly associated with Nobel laureate FA Hayek. Yeah So Hayek wrote a famous paper called The Use of Knowledge in Society. Um, and the concern is that central planners simply Do not and in fact cannot have enough information to make optimal decisions. They are going to mess stuff up. The niftiest example I can think of this actually is not government central planning, but corporate central planning, giant corporate institution, and how this can just not work sometimes. So, uh, a bit of, uh, technological history, uh, here, um, once upon a time, so if this, if we were in this classroom, so most of you folks look like you're Mac people now, um, if this classroom were, if this were 1998. There would be like one Mac person here and everybody else would be on Dell's or Lenovo might have been around, IBM, you had various things. Windows owned the world at that point. Microsoft by 2000 was by far the dominant personal computing company. And in fact, I think around that time they were the most valuable company in the world by market cap. Super well resourced Apple was basically dead. They had fired Steve. Steve Jobs founds Apple. Apple fires him. They, they're off in the wilderness with John Scully. They had a lawsuit. They bet everything on a lawsuit to sue Windows out of existence. They lose the lawsuit and they were like, wait, we didn't, we didn't think we're going to lose that lawsuit. We have no strategic plans. They drift. Around, they bring in some various CEOs that you've never heard of. That doesn't work. They realize finally that they're in a disaster, that they're in a really bad shape. Their new operating system sucks. It basically doesn't exist. They need to buy somebody else's operating system, so they go out and they buy a company called Next Computer, which has a nifty operating system. Next was the company that Steve Jobs had founded after he got fired by Apple. So this ended up being basically a reverse takeover. So Apple, much bigger company, buys Next, and all of the next executives replace the Apple executives and Steve Jobs becomes the CEO and basically just takes over the thing and then Apple gets good again. But for a while they were not, right? Microsoft, super wealthy. Super successful in hiring engineers, they could hire anybody they wanted, so they got all the best people. Right, and you got stock options, so you can hire the best executives, right, um. Microsoft also was intelligently paranoid. So Bill Gates, the guy who founded Microsoft. was aware of the history that existed when he founded it. So once upon a time, Silicon Valley, which we refer to as, you know, well, you know what I mean when I say Silicon Valley, right, that kind of thing was not in California. The Center for Computing and Tech Stuff was in Boston, Route 1, Massachusetts. A bunch of companies that you have never heard of DEC, the DEC people here, Honeywell, I think Honeywell was one. I don't know. A bunch of these companies don't exist anymore. Why not? They are wiped out by the personal computer revolution. Has himself in Texas, then then in the Bay Area. All right, Bill Gates in the vanguard of that knows that that happened and lives in fear that it is going to happen to Microsoft. So has a strategic plan. He is going to basically own the future. He doesn't know what the future is going to be, but whatever it is, he's going to buy up bits of it. So he's looking around and he's just buying up companies because he needs to own the future. He knows something's going to disrupt him. He just doesn't know what. OK, so Microsoft has all the resources of the world and all the incentive in the world to know what the future is. January 2007. Steve Jobs walks onto a stage in San Francisco and says there have been a bunch of rumors out there that that Apple is working on a telephone. We are, and I'm here to show it to you today. He reaches into his pocket and he pulls out a thing and he's a consummate showman. You can see it on YouTube. Watch, watch how he reveals it. And he says, I'm going to show you the side first because we we engineered this so beautifully. Now I'm going to show you the back. And now I'm gonna show you the front finally, he's like, you know, he's just building it up, shows you the front, and it's just fricking glass. Like there's no buttons. Where are the buttons, just freaking glass. The guy who's the head of Google's Android project, which was underway at the time, uh, said later in an interview, he's driving like he maybe he had been in the audience or he saw it on a live stream or something. He's driving back to Google and he realizes we have to just scrap what we're doing with Android and start from scratch. It's completely changed the game. OK, you now all have iPhones or knock-off iPhones in your pocket. Aye. That's January 2007, April 2007. Steve Ballmer, who is the CEO of Microsoft, is on a stage at a big CEO event done by USA Today. And so the big time CEOs are saying things, and this is what Steve Ballmer says, quote, There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance, unquote. All right. A few years later he gets fired because Microsoft phone, like nobody bought it and like it's. Microsoft was trying to do phones, but they, they, they just missed the vote. All right, so here's the, this is the knowledge problem, right? Here's a guy who's running a huge organization with the best people and every incentive in the world to get this multi-billion dollar, actually, like Apple's now a $1 trillion company. I think like $1 trillion question right. And doesn't boots it badly. Theory, there just is no way to get aggregate all the information that you need in one central decision maker to make the optimal choices. It can't be done. So that's a problem with central planning. At the end of the day, it's not going to be efficient, at least in many circumstances. All right, so what else can we do? Well, another institutional solution, another possible one is private property. So we got a problem with the commons in that anybody can just go out there and graze their cattle on the grass and then. Uh, so the incentives are all messed up. So let's change the incentives. Let's give every one of the ranchers exclusive rights to a particular part of the commons. This is yours. Nothing else is. Right, if you do that, then Ostrom says competition becomes competition between the ranchers and nature rather than the ranchers and each other. Ranchers in nature because they now have an incentive to try to make their land, whatever they've got, as productive as possible, right, so they're Fighting with nature to do that. Um, this is, um, a situation which again uses economics terminology, right? Because certain plots of land are yours. That means then that what happens on them is something that you are going to internalize the effects of altogether. If you eat all the grass on your land, you pay the cost of that. If you plant grass there, you reap the benefits of that. You internalize the costs and the benefits of your decisions with respect to grazing and with respect to planting. The result is then that you will make optimal decisions if you're rational, right? The result then is that the entire field ends up getting becoming as productive as possible. Great. OK, so now we've solved the problem of the commons, right? Well, Ostrom says not so fast. There are problems that arise if we're going to use private property as an institution too, no free lunch. It's all about trade-offs. One problem is a problem of enforcement. You can think of it, right. You now need fences and monitoring. So it's all very nice for me to have said these 150 acres are yours. But that doesn't mean that when you go to graze your cattle there, there's going to be grass there because somebody else may have come in and eaten the grass, right? If you are going to actually make sure there's grass there, you're going to have to make sure that nobody else is coming in and eating that grass, which means you're probably gonna have to fence them out, so you're going to have to put in fences, and then you're going to have to monitor to make sure nobody's cut the fences or that the fences haven't fallen down in the storm. Right, you're going to have to invest extra resources in securing your land and monitoring your land and protecting it. That's costly. Another problem that arises, we've now introduced a big risk problem. Suppose that this commons is really, really big, which means it has differential rainfall. So some parts of the Commons are getting a lot of rain. It's possible some year, while another part is not. It's getting very little rain. It's got a drought. Now, in a world in which this is all common, not a big deal. When it comes time for you to graze your cattle, you just take your cattle and go where the grass is, and you eat the grass there. Problem solved. Can't do that anymore though. Once we've got private property, it may be that your land is where there's no rain, which means there's no grass, which means your cattle are going to die. Meanwhile, way at the other end of the resource, they may be getting tons of rain. They've got more grass they know what to do with, more than they could feed their cattle with. They got extra grass, right? That's all going to go to waste. Bad Can we solve this? Yes, yes, we can by introducing other additional institutions. So we can do this by a combination of markets and insurance. So markets, we allow the people, we construct a system in which the people who have extra grass can sell it to the people who don't have enough grass. Woohoo! Pretty good. So we now have transferred the grass, so now the cattle are getting fed, except the people who don't have the grass may not have the money. To be able to actually buy the grass, that's not so good. Problem. OK, solved. We use insurance. Each person pays a little bit into a common fund so that then if they happen to get hit with drought one particular year, the fund will pay out to them and they can use that money then to buy the grass from the other people and whoa, we got it solved. Great, but now we've just added two additional institutions. So we have to set up markets, we gotta set up insurance, we gotta set up insurance companies, we've got to have regulations, regulators keeping an eye on these things to make sure that it doesn't all go sideways. Massively more complicated, very expensive. No free lunch. So what's the best approach? And the answer is both or neither, or maybe something entirely different. Um, there is no one size fits all answer. Ostrom argues that neither of them is always correct. Neither of them is the best way to do things. And then gives an example of something that falls in neither category. Just does it completely differently, right? Um, so this is fishing in Alanya, Turkey. It's a complex arrangement in which basically you have this big fishing area and it's divided into subzones, and each fisher is randomly assigned one zone. But you don't get it forever. At periodic regular intervals, everybody has to switch and you move over to basically the next zone, and so you rotate through. And so eventually everybody has been in every zone and then you start all over again. That means everybody has to spend some time in the lousy fishing areas and everybody gets to spend some time in the good fishing areas. And it works out. Now, monitoring of this is done by, so this is something like you have a right to something that kind of looks like a property right, but it's only temporary. Right, you got it right to the spot, but only for a short period of time, you're going to move to the next one. Um, monitoring is done not by the state, but by the fishers. Why would that make sense? Why, why do it that way? Well, yeah, so just say more.

SPEAKER 0
They'll know better than some faraway administrator about like what spots need, what amount of fishing when.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, I mean, so, so I mean you're on the right track. So basically, so the thing is, right, if you want to check to make sure that everyone's monitoring and being in the right place, who's going to be best situated to do that? Well, the people are out there on the water, right? I mean they can see, yeah, you're supposed to be there. All right, so, uh, so they monitor it, don't use the state. And what happens if somebody's fishing in the wrong place? How do you deal with that? Again, they don't involve the state, so what do they do? You have a friendly conversation which may involve breaking some legs or otherwise destroying their property. The threat of collective physical violence lies behind this, and everybody's willing to participate in that physical violence because they all want to make sure that when it's their turn to get the good fishing spots, they can. This is optimal in some ways. It's kind of efficient. Sorry for that, I'm hitting the high notes there, but I did not have time to get my water bottle, so I'm, I'm doing this dry here. I'm doing this completely, you know. Uh, hanging on by a thread. Um, the, um, uh, uh, you can't, uh, so this is kind of optimal, right? It seems like it's kind of efficient, but It's ultimately being enforced by mob violence. This is mob rule here, right? Is that so good? Well, Remember in Pearson against Post, one of the things that the majority was concerned about was like cutting down on the risk of disputes, right, and violence, and we'll see this issue recur again, right? Maybe that's not optimal either. But It's all about the trade-offs Um. At the end of the day Um, property, one of the standard justifications for why do we have an institutional property of property in the first place? Why do we have private property? One of the standard justifications is, is that it's basically the best way we can think of of solving the commons problem, right? It's not perfect, but it solves the tragedy of the commons problem. All right, so this is going to lead to ultimately efficient decision making, which is going to lead ultimately to a much wealthier society than if we didn't do it that way. Um, now, that said, There are other problems that Ostrom didn't touch upon. One of them. Vice dean of this institution. Became famous, his first, most, uh, probably the most famous thing he's done in his career is writing on this very influentially, the anti-commmons problem. So Michael Heller, um, uh, wrote the anti-commons. So, You have a problem with the tragedy of the commons where you don't have enough private ownership. The anti-communists is where you have too much private ownership. You can have a problem in which you have a particular resource and there are too many people who have ownership stakes in it, each of whom has a veto over what's done with that resource. Heller's account, I believe my recollection it's been a long time. I looked at it after a minute, is that so he's writing this in the context of the Soviet Union, Russia right after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Empire, and the question was basically what went wrong in Russia. And you had a bunch of things that were owned because of a communist country that were all owned in common in some sense, and the government know, hey, we're not doing communism anymore. We've got to figure out what we're going to do with these things. So they just basically like a department store, they would just give ownership to all the people who worked in the department store. Everybody had a fractional ownership bit in it, but they arranged it, I guess, institutionally badly so that too many people had veto power over what happens with it, and as a result, you couldn't use it optimally. I used to think of this because I'm old, and this is the way I encountered it, as the video store problem. You've never heard of video stores, but trust me, they existed. Um, I believe, uh, younger folks would refer to this maybe as the Netflix streaming problem. Say you get got a bunch of friends over and you wanna stream something, say, hey, yeah, we're gonna stream something, we're gonna watch something. It's like, OK, great, what are we gonna see? It's like, hey, how about this? I heard this is good, no, I don't, I, I don't like horror. OK, well how about this? No, I've seen that already. OK, well how about this one? I hate that actor. How about this one? I don't know, you know, it's like. It's well-nigh impossible to get everybody to agree on what it is you're gonna watch, right? If everybody, if you have too many people who have veto rights, then you can't get optimal use of the resource, right? Maybe at some point you just give up. Problem of the tragedy commons is overuse of the resource. Tragically anti-commons is underuse of the resource. Resources just end up not being used because you can't get enough people agreeing to it. Right, um, OK, any questions on this? All right, we're good. So just a like a note, a terminological note, I don't know if I made it quite as clear as I could have, um, it's just that, uh, property, if you're a new institutional economist, property is just an institution. Property, you know, we have property, it's an institution. There are all sorts of institutions in society. Property just is one of them, and this ties in a question that we've been talking about before and we'll talk about again. What's the optimal design for that institution? How do you design it? All right Let's talk water, which I don't have. All right, that thing which I don't have, so this will be very exciting for me or very very frustrating. All right, um, we're going to talk ownership of water rights here. Water is a big deal. Um, right now it may not seem like so much because there's so much of it in frozen form out there, uh, outside, but I grew up in California. And California water is a constant concern. Many, many years of drought. I grew up in Northern California and it was routine for Northern Californians to say, unironically, that Southern California is stealing our water, which is kind of true. I don't know if it's stealing, but they were taking the water, so Los Angeles should not exist. Los Angeles is on a desert. Um, it exists basically only because of an enormous amount of water that is being brought down from the north. How many people here have seen the 50 odd year old film, classic film Chinatown? Uh, OK. So, Roman Polanski film, great film, most cynical final line in movie history that I've ever encountered, uh, the last, the ending is extremely cynical. Um, if you watch it, it's famous for a bunch of things, but the most important thing to know about it, it's all about water rights. At the end of the day, uh, that movie is all about water rights. It's kind of based on the history of LA, um, and, uh, uh, ownership of water rights. Um, so, uh, Water is an extremely valuable resource and one that people will actually get engaged in conflicts over. We can expect looking ahead over your lifetime, that there will be wars as the climate changes and we have aridification of things, that there will be wars fought over access to water. So we're going to want to have some rules governing that, and the common law does. Now I will note for you that if you actually want to get into water law as a thing, there are a bunch of statutes and regulations often set down by the federal government that are an overlay on all of this. We're not going to get into that because it's not a water law of course, but that is something that's very important in practice. If you want to get into water law. Like there are jobs in that. I was at an ALI thing, American Law Institute thing a few years back, and uh I think she was a classmate or maybe a year ahead of me. Super successful student, like one of the most successful students. Uh, period. Like for years is where I went to law school. I was working for, uh, California, uh, and, uh, the water department in Sacramento and she said, hey, if you have any students who are interested in doing water law, we're hiring. Um, this is a few years ago. I don't know if they're still hiring. That's the thing, right? You can, uh, get a, you can spend a lot of time doing this. We're not going to. We're just going to talk about sort of the basics of the common law of water. And um. To start, it will be helpful to draw some distinctions that the law does. So one distinction is between surface waters and subsurface waters. The water on the surface and water below the surface. That you might reach with a well, say, or something like that. We are going to be focusing on surface waters in our discussion to keep things simple. The other distinction is between water in a defined channel. And water that is diffuse. Water in a defined channel is like water in a riverbed or a stream bed, something like that. Water that is diffuse is water that's not that. That's basically it's like floodwaters, that's just sort of going all over the place. Water in a defined channel is typically treated as a valuable resource by American law, probably European law too, but I can't say for sure. Um, diffuse waters are generally treated as a pest to be eradicated. Makes sense. Think about the difference between water, say you got some of you have water bottles here. So you got a water bottle and it's filled with water and it's sitting there on the desk in front of you and it's confined to the water bottle, valuable, useful. You can do it for things. You can drink from it. You can use it to wash things. You can do things. You accidentally knock it over. Now the water is spreading all over the place. Suddenly things have dramatically changed. Somebody is probably jumping out the door to go to the restroom to get a bunch of paper towels to try to mop it up, right? The diffuse waters problem to be eradicated. Water in defined channel, useful, valuable resource. All right, another bit of terminology that you will encounter here and we will be using is riparian. I should move my stuff out of the way here. Riparian. This is, well, there's a couple of different definitions they overlap, but the basic idea is somebody who owns land adjacent to a watercourse like a stream or a river or a lake. All right, so you own waterfront property, right, you're a riparian. Now, strictly speaking, and so there's a I'm going to give you a historical note that is mostly obsolete, but you may still encounter this language, right? So just to be aware of this, strictly speaking, historically riparian referred to only land that abutted a watercourse like a river or a stream. If it was on a lake, there was a different term, literal. That is really obnoxious. Yeah, I can't even spell right anymore. Discombobulated by the scratching sound. Yeah, literal. That means shore basically or near the shore. The, any, any navy vets here? Anybody navy? All right, uh, so the United States Navy has a ship called the LCS. Literal combat ship. which anytime you say it, it's the literal combat ship is what as opposed to a figurative combat ship, and it's literal because it was supposed to fight in the literals was the idea is that it would be in the shallow water near the shore and it would fight. It sucks. It's terrible, a terrible program. Navy tried to kill it. Congress said, screw you, we're going to make you buy more of them. And so we have been literally decommissioning them while still building new ones. It's all, it's a mess. It's it's a disaster anyway, uh, you might, you might encounter in the news in that context, but that's what the literal means like sort of seashore like things. So technically there's a distinction between literal and riparian historically you may still see that today in the law. But a lot of times riparian is just used for all of it, and we're going to do that. We're just going to keep it simple. So just for us, riparian just means if you're on a lake, riparian, if you're on a river, riparian, it's all riparian. Now one thing I know about riparian water rights is that they are appurtenant to the land. Ah That was louder than I planned. Uh, alright, it's a pertinent to the land. Um, what does that mean? That means that it goes with the land. If you buy the land, you get the water rights. They run with the land, right? So, uh, riparian rights are pertinent to the land. We are going to take a break. And let's take a break now. When we come back in 10 minutes, we will talk about various different principles you could use to allocate water rights. If that doesn't get you back in the classroom, I don't know what will.

SPEAKER 0
Uh, enjoy your 10 minutes and stay warm.

SPEAKER 1
See you folks back here in a few.

SPEAKER 0
That's. Oh Yeah. I'm good. Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you very much. Hey folks, let's get back into this here. All right, so we're talking about ownership of water.

SPEAKER 1
Given that somebody owns rights to a certain amount of water, how much water do they actually have a right to? What quantity of water is it? They're entitled to some of it, but how much is it? There potentially are several different principles that could be used to allocate water rights. The cases that we read in this section. Mention 3 of the most prominent options. One is the natural flow approach. 2 is the reasonable use approach. And 3 is the first appropriation approach. One thing to think about when considering these three different approaches is how they may reflect different fundamental competing. Principles of a just allocation of property rights in general, right, which principle may seem optimal, may vary or just may vary depending on circumstances. The main reason candidly why I keep water rights. In the course, some people do it, some people don't. I think it's interesting for illuminating the general question of like on what basis should we allocate property rights in general. All right, so one approach is the natural flow approach. This is discussed but rejected in Evans versus Merriweather. Um, According to the natural flow approach, each riparian is allowed to use the water in the stream, say, that they own land next to, but only to the extent that doing so does not disrupt the stream's natural flow. Everybody is entitled to enjoy the natural flow of the stream uninterrupted. Um, Taken literally, that might prohibit removing any water whatsoever, even a single molecule, would be then one less molecule that are downstream. Use it without But in practice it means you can't remove any significant amount of water. Um, Fuck. Basic underlying principle here seems to be that a just allocation of property rights is one that gives everybody the same. Everybody gets to enjoy the natural flow, so everybody gets equal. It's an egalitarian principle. That might seem attractive. I, we're all taught in kindergarten, at least I was taught in kindergarten many, many years ago. Oh, share and share alike, right? You're supposed to be equal with everybody. Everybody's equal. Everybody gets the same, yeah. Could you turn your microphone up a little bit? That'd be good. All right, how's this? Is this better? Well, at least the mic's on now. I can move the lab up closer to mine. Does that help? OK, all right. So yeah, it's, it's hard to do with labs. You never know quite how, where to put them. It varies from mic to mic. So thank you for pointing out that I've messed this up. One of the cool things that happens in law school is that people have all sorts of interesting backgrounds in law school. So when I was at Brooklyn teaching an evening class once, uh, like. It's an even class. There's no IT people around. The tech is messed up. I can't figure it out, and I have like a, I have like my voice is hoarse because I've got the flu or something and I'm like I, I, and I like I I was literally thinking I was going to have to cancel the class. And I, I, I open up a cabinet there and it's like all these switches and dials like I can't do anything. I'm like, I'm sorry, I just think I can't do this. And a gal who's sitting in the front jumps up and she runs up to me and she says, I was an audio engineer for 10 years, and she goes diving into that cabin and she's flipping things around and then she's putting on the lab on me. I, I think that's fine. It's like, no, no, no, not nearly good enough, and she's adjusting the stuff. So I had professional audio for one class. So you know, people in law school have all sorts of interesting backgrounds. Get to know your classmates. You'll never know what they've done. All right. Uh, so if that is a problem again in the future, please don't be shy about letting me know if you can't hear me. All right, um, Now a potential problem with the natural flow rule is that although everybody gets the same, what they get is almost nothing, right, because you can't disrupt the natural flow. So it's equal but kind of zero, which seems not so good. Now that's not, that's a little overstated what I just said there, because It's possible to be entitled to use more than the natural flow conceivably if you got permission from everybody else downstream of you, the people who would be adversely affected from doing so. Maybe, you know, getting permission in exchange for, say, money. Now I'll pay you if you'll let me use more than the natural flow, and they might agree to do that. The problem is, if the watercourse is of any size at all, then you're going to have what's referred to often as an assembly problem. You've got to assemble a large number of permissions, and that can be tricky. Suppose we've got a watercourse here and the water goes down like that direction, so that's downstream. And we got, uh, we got A here, B here, C here, D here. All right. A wants to use more than the natural flow, and let's say that this is then, and this ends, right? This is the uh Flows into the bay here. All right. So, um, and suppose A wants to use more than the natural flow. Well, A, Default is can't do so, but could maybe do so if got permission from B, C, and D, everybody downstream. Say, OK, yeah, you can go ahead and do that. But in order for that to happen, A has first got to invest in negotiating with B, C, and D. So this means we've got transaction costs there of negotiating that, right? And, and that's expensive, and we only have 3 people here, but you can imagine if it's a long river or something, it could be literally 3000 people. 300,000 people. Um, keeping it simple with this example here. Um, also, you could have what's known as a holdout, and you could have holdout problems. Now, you could have holdout problems for a couple of reasons. So one thing is that, uh, so say C here decides to be a holdout, right? C might just not want to give permission. C just maybe doesn't like A. C maybe just is a crank. Just doesn't want to give permission, period. Or has some ideological view about why that would be bad. Or it may be that C actually has no principled objection to it, but C is just smart and has noticed that, that A has acquired permission from B and from D. So A is good to go. If A can get C's permission, but C can hold up the entire thing, whatever it is that A wanted to do, that whole project depends on C's giving permission. So what's it worth to you? Hey, you've got a million dollars factory project here that depends upon getting permission from everybody. I'm holding this up. I can hold this up, you know, maybe the value I place on those water rights is maybe $1000 for me personally, but you know, for you, special price $500,000 right? That's called a strategic holdout. You can have strategic holdouts. So you can have holdout problems which drive up assembly costs, not optimal, right? So the end result might be that just can't do it. Right, which means then that we have a bunch of water that's going unused just into the bay, not optimal. American property law tends to favor productive use of resources. Historically, American property laws favored putting resources to productive use, in part because of our history, right? We were a continent that had vast natural resources. So hey, let's put them to use. So that rule did not catch on in the United States. Alternative then, well, it's like, OK, this is too restrictive. You can't disrupt the natural flow. That's too bad. Maybe we could loosen that up a bit and say, you know, you're entitled to make reasonable use of the river. Everybody's the right parent can make reasonable use of the river, whatever that means. And that is the rule that is in fact adopted in Evans versus Berryweather. So the Evans Court likes this rule. This seems to be an advantage, have the advantage that allows at least for some use, right? That's better than nothing. It's not all going to bay unused. That's, that's an advantage. And so that means that we can have more productive use of things. So we are promoting productive use of resources by allowing reasonable use. So this basically the underlying idea here seems to be that a just allocation of property rights is one that promotes socially valuable uses. It gives incentives or at least it removes obstacles to socially valuable uses deemed to be reasonable uses, where the ultimate determination of the use's value is made by the government, a court in this case. So the government decides, oh yeah, that's a good use, you can go ahead and do that, and that's not such a good use, so you're going to have to take a backseat to somebody who's making a better use. Ah Um, What, so that seems pretty good, right? Uh, what are potential problems with a reasonable use approach? You're law students, you love the word reasonable. I did as a law student too. It's like, yes, it's reasonable. All right, I'm gonna pick, yeah, in the back there. Sorry, I gotta get the seating chart and then I'll actually know names. Yeah, no problem, Charles, by the way, um, I think

SPEAKER 2
one of the issues that you can maybe find is like what does like reasonable mean, right? There's no standard definition and once you have like that. Uh, uncertainty about it, like reasonableness and like early similar situations can mean different things depending on who the fact finder is, depending on the judge and whatnot.

SPEAKER 1
So yeah, so you got a problem like we said, OK, reasonable use, but what is reasonable with the natural flow, you can just look and go, OK, I can't disrupt that, that you can figure out. Reasonable use is like, well, uh, now we got to cash out what reasonable means and Suggestion, so second suggestion that comes here, second problem is then, like who's going to be the one to fill that in, right? Um, who gives the content to what reasonable means? How it be a judge, that could be, now you're at the whim of what panel you get. That actually is a thing in litigation, right? There's all sorts of resources now spent on figuring out various judges' tendencies and various things. And if you're litigating before a jury and you have a big dollar thing, then I gather they do things like they'll actually bring in sample mock juries and you. We'll do your arguments to them like focus group testing for stuff because it turns out that there's some variation amongst these folks, and that leads to uncertainty and uncertainty can lead you to maybe not do various things because you just don't want to take the risk. Yeah Um This can also cause problems, right, if circumstances are changing over time, because what's reasonable today may not seem reasonable 50 or 100 years from now. It's a completely random thing that just popped in my head here. An example of this is, uh, I see written about all the time online, is parenting. I don't have kids myself, so I can just uh just vicariously see this, uh, that stuff that um When I was growing up, my mom was extremely protective, lovely woman, just a wonderful mother, very protective. Um, the sort of stuff that she would allow me is maybe even some people would have said been overprotective, allowed the kids in my family to do. Today, you know, they'd probably be throwing her in jail. It's like you can't let kids do that. That's just not reasonable. I mean, that's insane. Um, what is reasonable for kids to be allowed to do is very, very different. Uh, today than it was back when I was a little kid growing up. And anybody ever, no, none of you will have, I'll be shocked if any of you have seen this. 1928, I think, a film by King Vidor called The Crowd, silent film. Public Domain, fantastic movie. Highly recommended. It's silent. It's a silent film. There's an extremely poignant scene at the end, um, uh, in which there's, there's a kid. Part of it is like there's just a kid who's just sort of like left alone, but that's not what's poignant about it. It's just like, yeah, of course you just let some little kid run around the city. I mean, of course that's what you do, right? That would have been deemed extremely weird even when I was a kid. All right, so what's deemed reasonable, acceptable behavior with things just changes over time and how do you know what it's going to be? How do you figure that out? OK, so you've got a bunch of uncertainty there, which can prevent useful investment. So in order to address that, you could do coffin versus left-hand ditch. You can do the left hand ditch approach and do first appropriation. Right, we are going to give property rights to the water to whoever was the first to take that quantity of water out of the watercourse. Now this can seem to cut down on uncertainty. Right, because at least the identity of the person who is first is not likely to change over time, unless you got a time machine, right? Whoever was first just is first. So, no matter what changes in society, what changes in society may make what's reasonable differ. It was reasonable last year, not reasonable this year. But if you were first last year, you're still first this year. All right, so it's more stable. It also seems fairly concrete, pretty bright line, you know, probably not a lot of, uh, it's probably not going to vary from judge to judge who qualifies as first, baby. So that, that all seems good. Um, The underlying idea with this principle seems to be that a just allocation of property rights promotes economic development by rewarding initiative. Being first, going out there and do it first, and promoting certainty. We have a nice bright line, kind of concrete thing and OK, so then we can plan around that. But no free lunch. This has problems too. One thing about first acquisition of water is, well, that's a first possession regime. We already saw problems that arise with first possession regimes. And it may not always be obvious who is the first appropriator. Um, we can think about that conceptually when we discuss Evans versus Merriweather. Now, all right, so Evans versus Merriweather. Supreme Court of Illinois, 1842, page 312. All right, time to draw diagrams here. By the way. I find it helpful when I'm trying to understand property cases to draw a little diagram on some scrap paper that I have near me, to sort out who's where and who's doing what. I would encourage you to do the same. Like, I don't know if people, you're reading stuff online often, so maybe it doesn't seem so natural, but really, like just sketch out a little diagram for yourself. It can help keep things clearer. Um, actually, I suppose I should ask here, uh, just about, this is just about, uh, textbook preferences. So how many of you are prefer, prefer paper textbooks and how many, all right, so paper textbooks, how many of you print ones? How do you prefer the online ones? All right, about fifty-fifty. Interesting. All right. That's now useless information for me because it's fifty-fifty, but uh still, nonetheless, I at least know what I don't know. OK, so the setup for Evans versus Merriweather is pretty straightforward. You've got a watercourse. And Upstream to downstream here. And we've got, uh, let's see here, make sure I get the order right. OK, um, Smith and Baker. Buy some land through which the watercourse runs. They then build a steam mill on the land. Now a steam mill is not one of those mills that uses a water wheel, right, where it's just the kinetic energy of the water that moves the thing, but rather it's something that pulls in the water and then boils it off as steam and the increased pressure from the steam then moves the pistons, and that makes the machinery do its thing. OK, so they're actually bringing water, taking water out of the stream to use in the stream mill. So we've got a stream mill here. Mm Piped there and this is like Art All right, looks bad. It's a mill, trust me on that. All right, so it's bringing in, uh, it's taking water from the stream into this thing. OK, so, um. That's Smith and Baker. Later, Evans bought land upstream on the same stream, also installed a steam mill. Evans here another poorly drawn steam mill. Shocking and embarrassing admission here. I practiced that. All right. All right. Also bringing the water, and there we have it. OK. Um, then after Evans is put in the steam mill there, then Smith and Baker sell their land to Merriweather. Which is why this is Evans versus Merriweather. All right. Everything's fine for a while, but then. Drought hits. When a drought hits, there's not enough water for both steam mills to operate fully. There's not enough water to go around there. So Evans puts in a dam. To stop the water from going into Smith and Baker, now Merriweather's, uh, um, steam mill, but not, you know, not trying to screw them over. It's just Evans just needs the water for Evans' mill. All right, so it's taking all the water to go to Evans' steam mill. Merriweather, not happy, sues, saying you can't do that. If we apply first possession rules. To this scenario here. Suppose we were to say first possessor. Gets it. Who would win if we were doing that? Who's the first possessor here? Yeah Um, I'm just guessing maybe it would be Merriweather

because the first, um, usage of the land for this purpose was by the people who sold it to Merriweather, so maybe the title transfers in that way and that they're farther ahead in line because they like switch spots with them.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, all right, so the, the legal term. The ordinary legal way of phrasing that switching spots thing is stepping into the shoes of, that's a metaphor. So you could say, well, all right, so now one possibility here, there's two, there's two things going on here, but one possibility is, well, temporarily, In the sense of like who was like doing stuff for the streams, Smith and Baker was first. And maybe that magically transfers over to Merriweather. Maybe we could do that, doing that, although. You know, it kind of looks like if we're doing like who was there first, like it looks like Merriweather was there 3, so we might be a little nervous about that. But so maybe it was Smith and Baker, I mean, they were taking stuff out of the stream first, maybe it's. Maybe it's Merriweather gets to step in the shoes of Smith and Baker. Basically, whether they get to or not is a choice that the law will make one way or another. Almost certainly they would is actually the result, but that's a choice. Um, what would be an argument that Evans. The first possessor, yeah.

SPEAKER 4
Um, he built, once there was a drought, he built the dam first, um, which if the underlying principle behind first position is to encourage economic development through that kind of enterprising. He was the one who got to it first, so he would have first position under the new conditions.

SPEAKER 1
OK, excellent. So that is, uh, so that's that's a little bit more clever than I was, uh, um, looking for. But yeah, that's smart. All right, so what there if we're trying to figure out who's like the first possessor, maybe we'll look at what the purpose is of using a first possession regime, and if that's to promote like productive activity, maybe the dam is productive activity and so therefore, well, the person who builds the dam should get it. OK, very good. But let's suppose we're keeping it kind of simple and so we're not, uh, we're not getting that clever, yeah, in the red in the back there. I feel terrible about this. Like people have. It's William. Thank you. Um, I'm just thinking Evans is upstream. So in a sense, the water gets to him first. All right, so how would we like to maybe flesh that out slightly more, exactly that thought, but just maybe make it just slightly more. Right, so the water gets it, yeah.

SPEAKER 5
I don't know if this is what you're looking for, but technically the water is new as it comes downstream, so then. I guess they're acquiring the new water that's being moved downstream. Yeah, I mean, it's not going to play hide the

SPEAKER 1
ball here. The basic thought is that it's basically right, right? So the basic idea is that the first possession of what and if we're thinking about the water itself, what's water? Water is molecules, right? It's uh you got this sort of thing going on, right? You got 2 hydrogens. Uh, and oxygen there, right? You get these individual molecules going down, you know. Right, and each individual molecule is a separate thing, right? And Evans in taking the water out is the first to take those individual molecules out. Just as you know, there's more than one fox in the world, there's more than one whale in the world, there's more than one molecule in the world, and who's the first one to take those out? Oh, Evans. So you could have an argument that Evans is the first to acquire it, first possessor. You could have an argument that Smith and Baker is the first possessor. You could have an argument that Merriweather's the first possessor. So using first possession isn't necessarily going to solve the problem for us. We're going to have to figure out something else. To figure out later how, who, uh, figure out how we're going to determine who qualifies as the first possessor. Right. Now in addressing this, of course, Evans doesn't use the first possession approach. They use the reasonable use approach. They start by noting the natural flow approach is one that was followed by the English courts. And remember, American courts are following a lot of English law. We pay a lot of attention to English law in the 19th century. Why is that? Because after we had that dust up in the late 18th century, the whole 1776 and all that stuff, now we're a new country. We need laws. We don't got any. Where are we going to come from because they're all English laws. So what are we going to do? Well, we'll just keep using the English laws. And so, uh, uh, basically, America just adopted English law, sometimes explicitly by statute. So there will be states that just say English law up to this point is in fact the law of this state. And so as a result, through the 19th century, you will see US courts paying a lot of attention to what English courts are doing. So the court here takes a look at English courts. They say, hey, they follow the natural flow approach, but they reject it because they say basically it's just not productive enough. It's too constraining economically. You can't make enough use of this, so it's not done here. So then says that this will be the rule, right? Each riparian has, each riparian owner has a right to use the water, um, but. Both of the following have to be true, have to be satisfied. One, the use must be reasonable. And it must not injure any riparian landowner more than is necessary to accomplish the reasonable use. All right, so the use has got to be reasonable, and you got to be using no more than necessary to do that reasonable use. So even if your use is reasonable, if you're just taking twice as much as you need to do that, then you're not going to win, right? So both have to be satisfied. All right, so then what the court has to address is whether it was reasonable for the upstream user to consume all of the natural flow here. And as was noted earlier, we've now got to figure out some way to put content into the concept of reasonable. Oh well, what's, what's reasonable? And the court attempts to do this in a discussion that's much of what seems to be dicta to me, but it doesn't matter because it's in a casebook, so who cares. Um, that, uh, by distinguishing between uses to satisfy natural wants and uses to satisfy artificial wants. Right. Natural wants are things that are absolutely necessary. Um, artificial wants merely increase comfort and prosperity. And the court notes that depending upon circumstances, what is natural in one context may be artificial in another, right? Um, for example, the court notes water for irrigation. So if you are in Egypt, water for irrigation is a natural want, right? Egyptian civilization, as far as I know, is basically all centered on the Nile, because the Nile brings all this water down and so great, you can use that, you can grow plants, you can have a flourishing civilization, you can do all sorts of stuff. Um, if you go too far away, you don't have access to the water, so that's not going to work, right? But if you're in the rainforest, you don't need water for irrigation because it's just raining all the time, like there's tons of water going around. So in a rainforest, water for irrigation, artificial. What. In Egypt, in an arid part of the country or the world, would be a natural one. The court then says natural wants, uses to satisfy natural wants always trump uses to satisfy artificial wants. So if you're using the water for a natural want and the stuff downstream is all just for artificial wants, you are entitled to use 100% of the water if doing so is necessary. To satisfy your natural want. Natural wants always trump artificial wants. But if you have artificial wants clashing, which we do here, I mean they're both steam mills, right? They're identical uses, and they're both artificial, right? They're trying to make money using the steam mill, right? If you have that, then. How do you decide, and the court says. Uh, don't know. You got to let a jury now, quote, quote, neither has the right to use all the water, all of the right to participate in its benefits, unquote. But no universal rule can be set down, so you need to let a jury decide whether somebody has used quote more than his just proportion. I It's quite uncertain. Having said that, then, that applies only if we're dealing with somebody who isn't using all the water, and the court says, right. It's never OK to use just all the water if we have artificial ones competing. So here, Evans was using all the water, so no go, can't do that. Damn's not allowed. Merriweather wins. Case notes that the 2nd restatement of Torts. Uh, Section 850A, um, offers guidance on the reasonableness of the use of water. This is page 316 of the casebook, and the restatement helpfully, I can put helpfully in scare quotes, has a long list of things to consider, and I want to put helpfully in scare quotes because it's basically, it's one of those lists that's like one of these multi-factor things. It's like, yeah, everything they could think of. So the use is purpose, it's suitability of the watercourse, the economic and social values at stake, the harm caused by the use, possible accommodation techniques, protection of existing investments, the ability of adversely infected riparians to bear the loss, justice. All right, so you know, it's basically everything they can think of. So think of a lot of stuff and. Cite the statement. Anyway, that's in there. You can take a look at it, but it's, I'm not sure that it's really offers much illumination beyond what you would think just sort of sitting down trying to think about, well, what would be reasonable. All right, any questions on Evans? Wait, so just to clarify, the court's basically saying that there's no controlling rule here? Well, they say that the use must be reasonable. And it cannot exceed in quantity the amount that is necessary to accomplish the reasonable use. So that's a rule. Now then, the court gives us a scheme for how to sort of schematic approach to how to figure out what's reasonable, distinguishing between satisfying natural wants and satisfying artificial wants, and then says in a case in which you have artificial wants clashing, then. Unless one party is using all the water, which is not allowed, then how much you're allowed to use, you've got to give to a jury. OK. So now let's do the other case, coffin, coffin versus left-hand ditch. Uh. Supreme Court of Colorado 1882, page 317. Love the title of this case because it just sounds like a case coming out of Colorado from 1882. Coffin versus the Left Hand Ditch Company. All right, so here's the setup for this. We got a stream And then we've got a complicated arrangement that I'm going to drastically simplify because the complications are irrelevant for our purposes. And if I recall correctly, left-hand ditches upstream. All right. Yeah. All right. OK, got it. All right, so we got a left-hand ditch company up here. You need an H in there, the left hand ditch, and they are using the water from the stream to What are plants. Trust me, those are plants. All right, so watering some plants. Bringing in water to do that. Now, in order to effectuate that, to make that work, they build a dam, but the dam doesn't actually take all the water. It captures some of the water but allows other water to spill over. So they got a dam in there. Alright. Later, coffin comes in downstream and uh starts using water from the stream as well, again to irrigate plants. Good thing I didn't go to art school. All right, um. All right, there's your setup. Now, everything is fine until 1879, when again we got problems with the amount of water that exists. And so now there's not enough water to irrigate both sets of land. So not enough water is flowing down a coffin. So coffin partially breaches the dam. All right, to get more water flowing through. All right, knocks a whole lot to get more water flowing through. All right. Left hand ditch sues. The upstream user sues says, hey, you can't do that. I'm entitled to have the dam. All right, um. And having sued, they win. The court says, yes, you're entitled to have the dam. Now, one thing to note, these two diagrams, poorly drawn as they are. are identical I mean, yeah, this has got a steam mill there and that's got plants there, but Who cares, right? That doesn't matter, right? These two pictures are the same picture. But in this case, damn, not allowed. In this case, damn, thumbs up. All right, so what's up with that, right? So we have two basically identical fact situations. Completely different outcome. All right. Um, The court says that the right to first appropriation to water by first appropriation, not the riparian rule, has existed since the time of the first appropriations in Colorado. Quoting the court, the climate is dry and the soil, when moistened only by the usual rainfall, is arid and unproductive, except in a few favored sections. Artificial irrigation for agriculture is an absolute necessity. Water in the various streams thus acquires a value unknown in moister climates, unquote. I note, this actually sounds kind of similar to Evans. We get the opposite result, but it sounds similar to Evans, right? Evans said that water for irrigation might actually be a natural want in some places if it's dry. Right? So this isn't on the Evans scheme. This isn't necessarily artificial versus artificial. This might be natural versus natural, and what are you gonna do with that? Oh, that's not so obvious. Um, but it's not necessarily inconsistent with Evans. The court in left hand ditch then goes on to say the public policy in this country, unquote, and don't be confused by that by in this country they don't mean in the United States, they mean in Colorado in the West in this country has encouraged diversion in the use of water. Um, for agriculture, quoting the court, houses have been built and permanent improvements, part of the permanent improvements made. The soil has been cultivated and thousands of acres have been rendered immensely valuable with the understanding that appropriations of water would be protected, unquote. So we've got reliance interests here and we need the need for certainty. People have spent a bunch of money assuming that the water that they've been taken out, they can keep using. If you were to change the rule, then the first appropriation rule, then, quote, a great part of the value of all this property is at once destroyed, unquote. So this starts to sound maybe a little bit like, maybe like Pearson. I'm like concerned about certainty. We need to have certainty here so that people can make decisions relying on that. So the result is, the court says that the rule is as follows, quote, the first appropriator of water from a natural stream for a beneficial purpose has a prior right thereto, to the extent of such appropriation, unquote. All right, so note that there are 3 elements to this rule. One is you got to be first to appropriate it. 2, the use that you're appropriated for must be a beneficial purpose. And 3, the amount that you are entitled to is limited to the amount of that first appropriation. All right, so if you are starting, you know, if you're taking out, say, 100 gallons a day. And you're first to do that, right? Um, that means that you're doing some beneficial purpose from that. you're using it for some beneficial purpose. And later, that's fine, no problem, right. Then some folks downstream are using some water and so forth. And then later you decide that you want to expand that purpose, whatever you're using that 100 gallons a day for, and make it 100,000 gallons a day. Right, which is, you know, probably pretty common for major industrial things, uh, or even minor industrial things. 100,000 gallons a day. You are not entitled to do the 100,000 gallons a day. You aren't the first appropriator for that if that's interfering with what's going on downstream. You, you get 100 gallons, but not the 100,000, right? You may have to take a backseat to people downstream who are using the water to a greater extent, um. Uh, the Met. All right, um, Now, one obvious question to be asked here is what the heck isn't a beneficial purpose, right? So like, what's a beneficial purpose? Like, I don't know. It's the casebook has a note that has a dry wit in the final sentence there, two-word sentence. I'm guessing it was in there before Molly Brady joined the thing. I'm guessing it's a Tom Merrill line rather than Columbia's own Tom Merrill rather than Henry Smith, but anyway. Says well, that there's a case that there was, once there was a case in which using water to flood gophers off of property was deemed not to be a beneficial use. So there you have it. That's an example of something that's not beneficial. Not much guidance, but there you go. And the, uh, so then there's a citation to this case from California from 1935 and then the two-word sentence. That helps. Um, so I'm thinking that's Tom, but I don't know, might have been. All right, uh, one final thing and then you're out of here. Uh, which rule governs where that matters where you are in the United States. So the standard rule in the dry western southwestern states tends to be first appropriation. Everywhere else in the country tends to be riparian reasonable use stuff. So it's basically just geographic. I check your jurisdiction, but that's the rule of thumb for what rule is going to apply where. All right, any questions on that? Yeah. Sorry, can you just repeat the last thing you said? You said in this dry southwestern states, the standard rule is first appropriation and everywhere else is reasonable.

SPEAKER 0
It's a reasonable. OK, thank you.
