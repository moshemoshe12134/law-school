I know. OK, folks, welcome back.

SPEAKER 1
How is the audibility of me, my voice in the back? Yeah, all right, let's, let's see if I can crank this up. OK, how's this? The back, can you hear me at all? OK, well, you might be better off that way. All right, how's this? I have. That is nonlinear, right, so I was, I was going up like one step, each one of those things and you can't hear me, can't hear me, can't hear me, and then I did one, and now it's like up this, and somebody's not saying you can't hear me still. All right, so this is, uh, just, just FYI that is nonlinear there, that's I guess massively exponential on the curve there. I don't know, weird. Alright, well. All's well that ends well. Um, Uh, I, again, if my voice is real dodgy, so, uh, if you can't hear me at some point, let me know, and I will, uh, I will try to do something to fix it. Um, you can add a little air of danger to the class here. Will my voice survive the next two hours? Um, you can go bet on your prediction market on that. It's a binary thing there, so you can go on a Kelsie or whatever and, uh, bet on that, um. By the way, if you have like gambling apps or uh prediction market apps on your phone, um, my actually non-joking advice to you right now is to delete them. In fact, take them, take, you know, do it now. I'll, I'll give you permission. I'll like not do the class and just do that while you delete it. Um, be aware of the fact that you are entering a profession that is highly conducive to addictive behavior. Um, it is a, uh, that's just a, a feature of the legal profession. Uh, every 2 years once you become a lawyer, you're gonna have to sign, you have to pay your dues to, you know, like literally pay, pay some money to re-register as an attorney, uh, in New York, uh, happens on your birthday every 2 years, uh, and the packet that you will get will include a card talking about if you've developed an alcohol problem, here's the number to call. Um, because this is an issue and it's especially dangerous for lawyers if you're doing something like gambling because you have client money that's coming through and it's very easy to get in a situation in which you think you think to yourself, hey, you know what, I'll, I'll just make it right, the gambler's fallacy, classic gambler's fallacy, um, and so. You will be doing yourself a favor if you just stay away from that. It's an old guy without kids, so you're, you're like, yeah, you're the people that are gonna get inflicted with the, uh, old guy, uh, warnings here, but like I'm, I'm dead serious, uh, you're just better off without it. If you absolutely have to gamble, go to Atlantic City or go to Las Vegas or something like that, you know, it's, it's fine, you know, you go there and you, you, you lose your money, and then, then, then, you know, uh, the, the casinos, you know, they're gonna make money too. Uh, casinos are people too, so, um, yeah, give them your money that way. Just the addiction devices that we have in our pockets are just not a good thing for society, um, OK. Uh, as I mentioned on the first day of class, I apologize that the class session that meets immediately after is scheduled to meet immediately after President's Day, I can't do because Brooklyn is really weird with how it handles President's Day. So that Tuesday, February 17th, we will not be meeting. Instead, we will be meeting, we'll have a makeup session, which I realize some of you may not be able to attend, that Friday, February 20th, different time, different room. So it'll be at 11:30 a.m., so from 11:30 to 1:20. Um, and it will be across the elevator banks, it'll be in 104. All of this information, you don't need to memorize it now. All of the information wherever, uh, all of the information will be on the new syllabus installment which will be distributed on courseworks for you to download within the next few days. So it'll just be on there and you can see where you have to go and when you, when you have to go there again. I realize you may not be able to, like, I may be talking to an empty room, but that's fine because it'll be recorded, right? So, uh. Um, you can just check out the recording, um, and, uh, my apologies again for the inconvenience. Uh, last class we were talking about adverse possession. This is another form of sequential possession, right, this time in the context of real property rather than personal property, tangible personal property. We have a true owner whose possession has been dispossessed by the adverse possessor. Ordinarily that's a tort, that's trespass, but based on the discussion in armory and the subsequent cases, you might have then assumed or expected that the rule would be that the adverse possessor develops at best a right good against all the world except the true owner. But that's not what the law does. The law says that under certain circumstances, the adverse possessor's right is good even against the true owner. It's good against all the world. If you trespass long enough in the right kind of way, you become the owner of the property you are trespassing upon. Then we noted the traditional adjectival elements for an adverse possession claim. The possession must have been actual, exclusive, open and notorious, continuous, adverse or hostile under a claim of right, some jurisdictions, color of title, for the statutorily required time. And then we elaborated on each of those requirements. Actual, we're talking about actual possession. We noted the example of something that might not be that where you have a 50 acre parcel and you're physically doing things only on 2 acres of that. So there you're actually occupying 2 acres but not maybe actually occupying all 50. Exclusive Scott versus Anderson Tully, the case we had about this, that, you know, chopping down timber on somebody's land, whose land was it? Well, it turns out adverse possession answers that question. Um, the, uh, Court and Scott addressed this question by saying that, uh, addressed the exclusivity, uh, bit by saying that, uh, it required that the adverse possessors show that he or she intended to possess the land to the exclusion of everyone else's claims. And acted in ways that unequivocally indicated that he or she was exercising the dominion of a sole owner, in other words, was acting like. They own the place Now the court then noted that that doesn't mean the exclusivity requirement doesn't mean that no one else can use the property because true owners can let other people choose voluntarily to allow other people to use their property, so somebody who's acting like a true owner could choose to voluntarily let other people use the property. That's not a problem. With respect to Open and Notorious, Scott versus Anderson Tully was again said some things about that. Open, the open bit of Open and Notorious depended upon how visible the possession was. Good people see it if you're looking at it. Um, notorious depended upon what the community understanding was of what was going on, right? Was the possession known in the community? Continuity requirement was a different case, so we had the Howard versus Kunta, right, where we've got a bunch of people who thought they bought land and did buy land, but the deeds are for the lot next door unfortunately for everybody. The court in addressing whether the occupation had been continuous, says the requirement is for ordinary use of property of a like nature. In other words, take a look at the kind of property we're talking about. What's ordinary use for that property? In this case, because the property was summer home property, occupation during the summers only was sufficient. The court also said that tacking was allowed, right? In other words, the Kuntos were allowed to add the brief time that they themselves had been occupying the property to the time that their predecessors and interest had been occupying the property. Um, why? Because there was sufficient privity between them. Privity is just some legally relevant relationship, and the court said in this context, pretty easy to satisfy. It just has to be some reasonable connection between the various groups who you're trying to attack together, um. Some reasonable connection sufficient to raise a claim above that of a wrongdoer or a trespasser. Adverse, hostile, under a claim of right, some jurisdictions, color of title. The adverse of the hostile bit means that the possession is contrary to the true owner's rights. In practice it means you didn't have permission, right? If you're occupying something with somebody's permission, then you're not there contrary to their rights, so it's got to be contrary to their rights. This is an objective matter that has nothing to do with what's going on in the heads of any of the parties involved, so the hostility requirement doesn't mean that you're actually have any animosity or ill will or anything like that. It just means contrary to their legal rights. Um, for claim a right, there are different competing conceptions of it. There's 2 real ones and then 1 fake law school one. Some jurisdictions require good faith, some jurisdictions don't care, and then the fake law school one is that once upon a time Maine maybe, maybe not, uh, required bad faith. Carpenter versus Ruperto was an example of a court explicitly requiring good faith, and we noted that that is an outlier case. Um, color of title, some jurisdictions doesn't matter, some jurisdictions is required, some jurisdictions isn't required but gives you certain advantages if you're claiming under color of title. Uh, and finally, the legally required time, look up your statute to tell you what that is, but remember that it may be extended by the rules for tolling for disabilities. Then we briefly discussed or touched upon the pros and cons of having adverse possession as part of property law at all. Why are we even doing this? Some of the justifications that have been traditionally offered include those based on human psychology. Somebody who's been on property or had property for a long period of time may just grow attached to it. And therefore wrenching it away from them will be viewed as like very, very hard on them, and they may lash out and so that's that's not so good. So over time people get attached to things, uh, we'll just let them keep it. Um, another justification is property law, American property laws favoring active users of property. So we, you know, you might think that hey, somebody's leaving a lot vacant. No, it's not so great. If somebody else is gonna come in there and actually do good stuff on it, then, you know, hey, better, you know, you might think that in Carpenter versus Rupero, right? We had a, a lot that was just, uh, filled with junk, and then, uh, the lady, uh, uh, next door decides to, you know, let's, let's approve it. So she grades it and plants grass and installs her propane tank and does this stuff. Hey, somebody's making productive use of the property. Maybe that person should be rewarded, right? So that's another theory for this. Um, and then another standard one is decreasing information costs of, uh, um, acquiring property um or dealing with property. Um, if you buy something, you want to know that the person you're buying it from can actually sell it to you, that it's actually theirs, and. It's good to be able to rely on the fact that well that person's been living there for, you know, they've been on this property for 25 years, so OK, if I buy it from them, then yeah, I get it. You don't want to have somebody popping up saying, hey, here's this deed that was in my great aunt's, you know, attic, uh, from 110 years ago that says now I own it. Oh, how are you gonna. You don't wanna have to deal with that and how could you even protect yourself against that, right? So, um, adverse possession sweeps away a lot of these problems by just saying we've got a statute of limitations that says after 10 number of years, 10 years in New York, that's it, you know, stuff that happened before then, we're just not gonna worry about. Now we also noted, uh, very briefly, but it's a point, you know, worth keeping in mind that all those traditional justifications say nothing about whether the adverse possession was done in good faith or bad faith, right? Um, and so you can see why it might make sense to say that good faith or bad faith is irrelevant, but for a lot of people. Including some people in this room seemed like, uh, that seems kind of weird, right, to say, hey, you know, somebody may have known that some property wasn't theirs and they're just occupying it for a while and they get to keep it that may seem bad, um, and so in fact states like New York have changed their laws to require some good faith and this may that fact may suggest that you know the standard justifications for adverse possession. May be incomplete, right? They may be missing various important things, and that's true of a lot of stuff in the law, right? Uh, you can have some fairly convincing uh justifications for things that end up being incomplete and sometimes the incompleteness is, uh, quite important. OK. That was that. So today we're gonna start talking about uh the topic of what? Should be owned as property, um, so to this point we've been talking about various ways of coming to own something. And one of the ways we've been talking about it is first possession. If you're the first person and take something that nobody else has owned, then it's yours. OK, you've come to own it. Now you might think that an extreme example of that would be being born with the thing, right? You're absolutely the first person on the planet to have that thing because you were born with it, right? So that might then lead you to think that you've got property rights to your own body parts. Um, but that assumes. That body parts are the kinds of things that should be ownable as property, right, so this raises the question of what kind of stuff should we treat as property and what kind of stuff should we say no, property is not considering this to be uh property is a category mistake. It's not the kind of thing that we are going to deal with as property, right? One standard term that shows up in this context and concerns about. Treating things as property, although it's not. I mean it's kind of about it being property, but anyway, probably encountered the term before if not you will now. Uh, broken chalk, disappointing. Ivy League's supposed to have the fancy chalk. All right, um. Commodification, uh, uh, you will encounter this more in your law school career if you, you know, whether you've encountered it, uh, up until now you will in the future. Right, the idea of commodification is that something is, so that's a bad word, right? It's like, oh, commodification is typically viewed as bad, right? Uh, it's not like, hey, great, we can commodify that. Um, I think if you're in the business world sometimes actually it's just a descriptive term rather than a normative term, but in the legal context is typically normative and negative normative. It is taking things that should not be subject to market exchange and making them subject to market exchange. How does this relate to property? Well, we haven't talked yet about the rights that you have as somebody who owns property, but one of the basic rights that's been very familiar to you, right, even before coming to law school, is that you have a right to transfer ownership of things. Something's yours, you could sell it, you know, those of you who buy used casebooks have bought it from somebody who had a casebook and they, they sold it to you. Um, you may sell your casebook at the end of the semester yourself, right? Um, so you can transfer it, you can give it as a gift, right? So you can transfer things, um. Some people think that having some things transferable through markets, putting a price on them, somebody pays money for it, is bad, shouldn't be allowed. We talked about this, touched upon this the very, very, very first day of, uh, the semester. We're talking about places in line, right? Uh, people standing in line, should you be able to sell that? That's a question like should that be property or should it be something else, right? Um, if it's your property, yeah, sure, of course you could sell it, probably. Maybe not. We'll talk about that later on, but, um, um, that's a concern with that. There's concerns about various, uh, other forms of commodification as well, commodification of all sorts of things. What kinds of things should we allow, uh. Uh, to be subject to market exchange. So you may worry about that with body parts, right? Are body parts that sort of thing? Are people that sort of thing, right? People have been bought and sold for millennia in human history, right? Generally today, not viewed as a good thing, right? Um, not everybody would agree about that, even today in this planet, right? Um, the, uh, there's an issue, right? So I mean it's a normative issue, um, and, uh, how do you address that? OK. Um Oh, right, a prominent example of this sort of thing is something you're probably all interested in and we're not going to talk about. So uh here's the get ready to get disappointed. Intellectual property, right, you people are all interested in intellectual property. It's cutting edge stuff and you deal with this stuff. You get copyrights, you get patents, you get trademarks, you get trade secrets. You got all that cool stuff. I used to do a unit on intellectual property and then I just stopped because there's just no way you can do it justice in one unit, um. You have excellent intellectual property faculty here at Columbia. I encourage you strongly to take at least an intro to IP course. Really interesting, but one question that arises with respect to it is, is intellectual property really property? Right, are these creations of the human mind something that should have exclusive ownership rights attached to them? When I took intro to intellectual Property in law school, the course was called Intro to Intellectual Property. The person who taught it refused to call it that. Um, showed up that way on the transcript, refused to call it that. Call it regulation of information production and exchange. Um, he was very committed to this, and he, uh, clear at the outset. He says calling something intellectual property is a conclusion of an argument, not the start of the argument, right? Should we treat it as property? This guy was a Marxist, famous, and so, you know, he thought it was bad to, bad to do this stuff, and, you know, interesting class. Um, maybe he was right. OK, so there's a question, what sorts of things should be ownable? And we have a famous case on this, Moore versus Regents of the University of California, Supreme Court of California, 1990, page 210. So, setup for this is Moore was diagnosed with leukemia. Right, he was treated at UCLA by Doctor Goldie. Doctor Goldie recommended that Moore's spleen be removed in order to slow the progress of the leukemia. Moore than signed a consent form saying yes, I agreed to the surgery, you can go cut into my body and remove this thing. Goldie had not disclosed to Moore that Moore's spleen had certain unusual characteristics and that Goldie planned to do research on white blood cells that were taken from Moore's spleen. The spleen's unusual characteristics would make Goldie's research easier. So they do the operation, removes the spleen. Goldie creates a new cell line. Based on cells taken from the spleen, so a cell line is basically just a, a group of cells sort of reproduces and you just keep, keeps going on so then you can do research on them. All right, so he gets these special interesting cells and he creates a new cell line from it, um, then gets a patent on it. Alright, so patent is exclusive intellectual property rights on this gets a patent on it, um, in, uh, on behalf of the scientists who are working on the project and the University of California at Los Angeles. I don't know how things stand in a place like Columbia currently, but as of like 20 years ago, universities were really, really leaning in. To, uh, the idea of getting intellectual property rights on the stuff that their scientists came up with, so they wanted to have patents on everything basically that was generated no matter who had paid for it, right, even if donors had paid for it or the government paid for it, they didn't care, right? They just wanted to make sure they got it because it was extremely important that their endowment become as large as possible, right? So the various models of higher education. One not incredibly wrong model is that. Fancy schools. Are more or less hedge funds that uh have a sort of ancillary educational thing that kind of like exists in order to get alumni donations and that's more or less what they do and now I think that's modifying in some places where they're they're hedge funds and medical centers um because a lot of money in medicine as we have an aging population and basically everything's done to then maximize basically uh income over expenses, um. We used to joke about that when I was in grad school, about uh uh uh one of my degrees was uh from Princeton, we would joke about how Princeton was basically that. And I'm not sure that that was really a joke. Um, I gotta say it's, uh, there's something to it. So anyway, there's a whole issue about who should own these things, right? So who should own scientific breakthroughs? Who should own scientific breakthroughs that are made by scientists at a public university? Uh, alright, so that's an interesting question which we will not get into in this case. So it's, uh, just sort of highlighting for you various things that in your legal career you can go think about, OK, um. So they get a patent, which means they get exclusive rights. They then sell exclusive rights, exclusive access to the materials and the research based on that cell line, in a contract with somebody for $440,000 for 3 years. Adjust that for inflation in today's money, it's about a million dollars. OK, a million dollars, I mean that's to me that's real money, but to UCLA that's pretty much nothing, um, but. There was thought that the potential market size for this kind of product was estimated at $3 billion per year. That's billion with a B, and when you're starting to talk billion with a B, now you're talking real money. Alright, uh, adjust that for inflation, that's 7 billion per year. OK, kachching, Scrooge McDuck, right? The, uh, the, uh, cartoon eyeballs like, uh, scrolling up there with the dollar signs popping up kachching. Whoa, billions of dollars here. When Moore found out what happened, he sued Goldie, the other scientists, and UCLA, right? Included in that suit was a claim for conversion, right, which is taking personal property without the owner's consent. Right, um, so it's called conversion because you have some property, I take it without your consent and I convert it to my own use. That's why it's called conversion. OK, so sues UCLA for inter alia conversion. Trial court dismisses the conversion claim on the grounds that Moore's spleen cells, once they left his body, weren't his property. Conversion is. The defendant took the plaintiff's property without the plaintiff's consent. If the plaintiff didn't have any property, then there's no way that you could have had conversion. So trial court dismisses the conversion claim. Supreme Court of California here affirms, right, holds that the spleen is not property. It's legal analysis comes in two parts. Part one. Asks whether existing law on the tort of conversion gives more a cause of action. Part two After the answer to part one is ultimately no, existing law doesn't. Part two then is, OK, given that existing law doesn't, should it, should the law of conversion be extended to encompass body parts like this? So we will deal with each of these two questions in order. So first up, does the existing toward a conversion encompass us? And the court says conversion requires interference, actual interference with either a right of possession. Or ownership. OK, note here, this is important in property law it's one of these distinctions that's a. You know, it's a technical distinction, but an important one. Possession and ownership are not the same thing, often go together. But are legally distinct. For example, example will be intuitively clear to all of you, right. Uh, if you're renting an apartment or have rented an apartment or know somebody who's renting an apartment, right, there we've got an owner of the apartment, right, this person owns the apartment. And we've got somebody who has a right to possess the apartment, the renter. The person who has the right to possess the apartment does not own it, right? At the end of the lease they're gone, right? It's not theirs. They cannot sell the apartment to somebody else. They don't have ownership rights, but they do have a possessory right. Right, they are allowed to possess the apartment, stay there, you know, put in furniture, you know. Do various things, live there, the owner. Owns the property can sell it but cannot possess it during the term of the lease. There'll be something in the lease saying that they can come in and do maintenance and things like that, but they can't just go, hey, you know what? I really wanna hold a party this weekend, and that apartment would be great for it, so I'm just gonna go in there and do that. Can't do that. All right. Ownership and possession are not the same thing. Often go together, but not always. Alright, so conversion requires interference with either ownership or possession. Now the court quickly dismisses the possession prong here. Clearly there's no interference with Moore's right of possession in the excise spleen because Moore clearly had no expectation of retaining the spleen after it had been removed in the surgery. I mean you, you just imagine the situation here, right? Moore. Comes out of the anesthesia, right, he's under general, and they, uh, finally, finally wakes up and they say, well, I got good news. Uh, the, uh, uh, operation seems to have been a success. We got the spleen out. There were no complications, uh, so, uh, you can go home now and, uh, by the way, here's your spleen, and then holds up a plastic bag in which there is a. Leukemia ridden spleen, they're sitting there, it's like, OK, you know, uh, here you go. It's like, what would you do with that? He doesn't want it, doesn't wanna see it. It's like, yeah, yeah, OK, so he had no right of possession that was being infringed here. But Maybe he had a right of ownership nevertheless, even though he didn't want to possess the thing, maybe he owned it still, and the court says no for three reasons, one of which we will just mention the existence of. So, and that is the court looks at some patent law doctrines and says some stuff about patent law, and it's not a patent law course, so we'll just note that they say something about patent and then move on. Alright, the second reason is that there's no reported judicial decision. I say that, uh. Uh, supports Moore's claim as pressive. And the court goes on to say the following, quote, we do not find this surprising. Since the laws governing such things as human tissues, transplantable organs, blood, fetuses, pituitary glands, corneal tissue, and dead bodies deal with human biological materials as objects sui generis. So sui generis means kind of like unique objects sui of their own generous genus is a type of their own category. Right, so it treats all these biological things as object sui generis, regulating their disposition to achieve policy goals rather than abandoning them to the general law of personal property. It is these specialized statutes, not the law of conversion, to which torts courts, excuse me, ordinarily should and do look for guidance on the disposition of human biological materials, unquote. So what they're saying here is that these things are different from water bottles, pencils, coats, laptop computers, and because they're different, they should be treated differently, right? Property law is a lot of things. And, and things have different characteristics. And so we have different rules for personal property and real property, and we may wanna have different rules for different types of personal property or different things like that. So the court says, Biological materials are sui generis. They're their own type. And so California has specialized statutes that deal with these things, and they deal with them based on policy considerations rather than you can see the kind of sneering, you know, abandon them to the general law of personal property. Uh, somebody didn't enjoy his or her property class in law school, I can tell, um. So the idea is. These, uh, these should be, these are different and should be treated differently. Then Deals with an argument that was raised that well. We need to protect Moore's privacy and his dignity. And so therefore we're going to treat his spleen as his property, right? And you can see this, so you might think intuitively, just if you're backing up and thinking, hey, is it, should we treat human beings are human beings item, you know, uh, body parts as property, you might think, well, no, I guess that would be bad. There's an argument that some people find compelling that in fact, no, actually it'd be really good to do that because that enhances autonomy. Because the idea is you can do what you want with your property. And if your body is your property, that means you can do what you want with your body. You have control over it, just as you have control over your house, you can put in a stove, you can take out a stove, you can do what you want, you have control over your body. If you wanna put in a neuralink brain thing in your brain, you can go ahead and do that, it's your body, your choice. Alright, um, so, you can see an argument saying, well, We want to protect your autonomy and privacy, and we can do this by saying that Moore has a property right to this, that will protect that. And the court rejects the idea on the grounds that um we basically you don't need to make this property in order to accomplish that. Quoting the court, 1 may earnestly wish to protect privacy and dignity. Without accepting the extremely problematic conclusion that interference with those interests amounts to a conversion of personal property. Nor is it necessary to force the round pegs of privacy and dignity into the square hole of property in order to protect the patient, since the fiduciary duty and informed consent theories protect these interests directly by requiring full disclosure. The basic idea here is. There are two things going on here, right? So one thing is, and this is just a standard lawyer tactic, right? You want your client to win. So you come up with any argument you could think of for why your client should win and so you want this to be property, OK, well, I don't know, we like, we like privacy and dignity, so, OK, so let's say therefore it should be property. All right, makes sense, right? You try everything. Um, courts will sometimes do that, right? They want to accomplish some goal that they think is right. And they are limited by existing doctrinal categories, so you try to fit the current case, the case before the court, into one of these doctrinal categories, even if it's kind of a tough shove to get it in there, and the court here is saying we don't need to do that because there are other ways of protecting this. The informed consent rules, so meaning that. Patients have the right retain the right to avoid objectionable use of their body parts for science, things that they would object to, because they can choose to be treated by somebody else. If they don't like the plans for what's going to be done with their spleen after it's taken out, they can go to a different doctor. And the informed and as long as we require that the doctor inform the patient of what it is that's in fact planned, then the patient can choose one way or another whether to do that or not, so their privacy and their dignity is protected. All right, so that's one argument for saying, look, the existing stuff doesn't uh cover this existing uh conversion law doesn't cover this, and then the court has an interesting additional argument. Well, they say the California statutes. Drastically limit patients' continuing interest in their excise cells. Biomedical waste disposal statutes establish sharp practical limits on what patients can actually do with their excise cells. The statute requires that they be disposed of in specified ways after their scientific use is finished. So basically you've got to do one of a small number of things and that's it. You have very little choice about this. Now I will note as an aside. Um, but this is an extremely ironic argument in this case. So I, uh, another place I got a, I got a degree from like too many schools. One of them is UCLA, and I was, uh, I got my master's degree there just after this case was, uh, decided. I, I showed up there, um, and so I remember reading about this in the LA Times because it was kind of close to home, um, the, um, uh, at the time, the court is writing this time is being decided. UCLA Medical Center, which is very large, had a practice of disposing of biomedical waste by shoving it in containers, taking them out in Santa Monica Bay, and just dumping them in the bay. Santa Monica Bay is lovely. There's a lovely beach there. It's fantastic, and they would just go out in the bay and just dump it out there. My brother was an undergrad at UCLA at around this time, and like just after this, and, uh, I remember telling, uh, he told me, uh, one, Christmas break that uh he'd gone out surfing. Uh, in Santa Monica Bay, and you know when you go surfing eventually you go off the board and you go underwater, right? And so he did and then he came up and he saw there was just a bloody bandage that was just, uh, adhering to his chest there. It's like, oh, that's just not good, so. There are rules that UCLA was completely ignoring, but the court didn't wasn't aware of this at this time. Doesn't really matter legally. I will just note that it's, you know, what the law says and what people do may be two different things. So, uh, the argument is. That um Um, It matters a lot that California law really limits what you can do with excise cells, and the court says the following. By restricting how excise cells may be used and requiring their eventual destruction, the statute eliminates so many of the rights ordinarily attached to property that one cannot simply assume that what is left amounts to property or ownership for the purpose of conversion law. Unquote, OK. The term the court does not use but is often used in this context and is lurking in the background of this here is very common in modern understandings, contemporary understandings of property law, um, the bundle of rights conception of property, which isn't really a conception of property even though everyone says it is, it's really a conception of ownership. All right bundle of rights. Right, the idea. The underlying idea with the bundle of rights conception of property ownership is that ownership is. Akin To a bundle of sticks. Right, um, so think about owning a bundle of sticks, right? You have a bundle of sticks. The fact that you own it doesn't matter, just you're looking at a bundle of sticks, OK? You got a bunch of sticks and they're, they're tied together. Now, suppose somebody comes and removes one stick from the bundle. Do you still have a bundle? Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, you still get a bundle. Suppose somebody adds an extra stick or two to the bundle. Do you still have a bundle? Yeah. Suppose somebody takes one stick from the bundle and swaps it with a stick from somebody else's bundle. Do you still have a bundle? Yeah. OK. If we think of property ownership as a bundle of rights, various rights to various things, we haven't talked about what those are yet, but trust me, they exist and you can probably imagine some of them, right? Um, if, um, so yeah, we've already touched upon the right to exclude people from things, the right to transfer, so you have these various rights. If we think of property ownership as a bundle of rights, then we can remove some rights and you still have property. We haven't taken your property, you still have property. We can add to it or we can change that and OK, great, so you still have property that hasn't been interfered with. This is attractive for various people for various reasons, uh, which we need to get into, right, um, but the basic idea here is that this is, it's not that property is like some inherent thing that has a unitary nature and if you tinker with it at all, then it ceases to be property. No, it's this malleable kind of thing.

SPEAKER 0
But Even if you buy that view, and not everyone

SPEAKER 1
does. It is ubiquitous in American 1L property courses and probably overwhelmingly subscribed to by American property academics I would say and therefore by judges because they all went to law school, right, um. Even if you buy this view. There's a further question as to whether The bundle is infinitely malleable. Whether it You can get to a point at which you've taken out so many things that you don't have. Property anymore or bundle. So just imagine again the bundle of sticks. Um, it is, you know, you take out one stick, yeah, you start out with a bundle of, say, 26. You take out one stick, do you still have a bundle? Sure. Take out another stick, do you sell a bundle? Sure. But if you get down to like two sticks, do you still have a bundle? I, I don't know. And if you get down to one stick, you, you just got like one stick there. You don't have a bundle, buddy. Yeah, you're just carrying a stick. OK, um, at some point you might think if you're taking out too much stuff, you just no longer have the bundle anymore. Likewise with property, you might think if you've removed too many rights from. The ownership bundle, you just what you have left just is no longer property. The court here is saying it, it doesn't use the bundle of rights term, but the idea is floating clearly floating in the background here, right, saying that the California biomedical waste disposal statutes. Quoting the court, eliminates so many of the rights ordinarily attached to property. The one cannot simply assume that what Is left amounts to property, right? Basically you've removed so much from the bundle that you no longer have property. Um, the dissent by mosques dissents on various points, this is one of them. Says that the fact that California biomedical waste law places restrictions on what Moore can do with the spleen after it's taken out of his body. Um, doesn't entail that he has no remaining property interest in the tissue. Right, why? Because various other things that we. Routinely considered to be property have similar sorts of restrictions placed on them, so various other things have those bits taken out of the bundle and we don't go they're not property anymore, so that should be true of spleens as well. And then Moss gives three interesting examples. All of these are restrictions that the law places on the disposition of personal property. So, some personal property, Moss points out, can be given away, sorry, can be sold but not given away. also some stuff you can sell it, but you're not allowed to give it away. This is probably the most arcane example for most of you folks unless you happen to work in bankruptcy prior to coming to law school, which this, this being Columbia, probably like 2/3 of you did, but anyway, um, uh, so in bankruptcy, so the basic idea of bankruptcy, right, is somebody owes a bunch of money. A owes a bunch of money to a bunch of creditors, B, C, D through Z, right right, unfortunately, A is in a no longer in a position to be able to actually to pay off all those debts. A has borrowed more than A can pay back. At some point he realizes that and so enters the bankruptcy process and now a bankruptcy court has to sort out who's gonna get paid what and the basic idea is there's not enough money to go around so the court's gonna try to pay the people who are owed to the creditors what they can and. In theory, like, one way to work it is that everybody would take a hair, everybody would take a haircut. Everybody would get paid back only a part, uh, 75 cents of the dollar or something like that. Now bankruptcy is more complicated than that and much more interesting than that because it actually turns out there's a priority list there. And so some creditors get placed ahead of, uh, at the front of the line, and other people get placed at the back of the line, and it matters a whole lot where you are in line. So there's all sorts of stuff that gets, uh, worked out in bankruptcy, right, um, but the bottom line is, so maybe the people at the front of the line are actually gonna get paid almost entirely or maybe they get everything, uh, all they get back, but somebody's gonna end up unhappy, right, guarantee there's not enough money to go around. OK A owes us money, can't pay it all. A has a bunch of assets. A may be coming to the realization bankruptcy is on the horizon here, realizing, oh dear. And then transfers things in anticipation of bankruptcy. Right, Knows that bankruptcy is coming, transfers things. Hey, maybe curry some favor with some folks by, I'll just give you this factory or something, right? Hasn't declared bankruptcy yet but is looking to do that, cannot do that, right, because that screws over the creditors, right, so you can't give it away, but. Can sell it for fair market value. Because they sell it for fair market value, then they're bringing in the money that's the equivalent of what that asset is worth, and all the creditors care about is money, right? So, OK, that's fine, then there's money the credit can go to the creditors, so that's fine. So in anticipation of bankruptcy or after bankruptcy has been declared, um, you can sell. Certain property, but you cannot give it away. There's also property that can be given away, but you can't sell it. So if you are somebody who likes the outdoors, likes hunting and fishing, right, when the weather gets good, you can get a recreational hunting or fishing license, and this entitles you to go hunt and fish to a certain amount, up to a limit. All right, so say you're fishing, right, and you catch some fish. Great You are entitled to those fish. Those fish are yours. You can eat the fish, you can give the fish away to friends, right? But you cannot sell the fish because you have a recreational fishing license. If you want to, want to be in the selling business, you gotta get a commercial fishing license, different thing, right? So there's a restriction on what you can do with the fish, but nobody says that means the fish isn't your property. No, it's your property, there's just a restriction on what you can do with it. Some things Mosque points out can be neither given nor sold. They're yours, but you can't give them away, nor can you sell them. One example, prescription drugs. All right, so you go to the doctor, they prescribe you some antibiotics. You do the course of the thing, you get an extra 6 pills in the thing, and you don't actually dispose of it because disposing of pills is a pain in the neck. Now you're not allowed to really just throw them away. You're supposed to go to some safe disposal anyway, you got the thing sitting here, sitting in your, uh, uh, medicine cabinet there. And then it's a thing that used to happen all the time. I hope it's not still happening. But maybe, I don't know, so somebody, you know, you've got a friend or something who comes down with a cold or the flu, and you give them some of the extra antibiotics. Don't do that, it's illegal, but also it's pointless. Colds and flus are viral. Antibiotics treat bacterial infections. It does absolutely no good. All you're doing is creating antibiotic resistant organisms. So that's bad. Another thing you can do is some people have like antidepressants or something like that, and or sedatives that they've been prescribed and they give them to a friend. Illegal. If you're doing that, stop. Don't do it, it's illegal, right? You're not allowed to give it away, you're also not allowed to sell it. OK, you can't give away, you can't sell your prescription drugs. Another thing that you can either give away nor sell. Much to your dismay. Professional licenses. All right, so you will eventually, after you pass the bar and do the character and fitness thing, become licensed to practice law in some state, most of you probably New York, but, uh, whatever, whatever your preferred jurisdiction is. You now have a professional license. At some point, you may no longer want to use it anymore. You just get sick of being a lawyer or you, uh, you know, you reach the age at which you're gonna retire, whatever it is. Pretty valuable. You know, the license to practice law, you'd like to be able to sell it or maybe you give it to a favorite niece or something. Um, you cannot do that. Disappointing to you, I know because you know you're gonna have to, you're paying all these gazillion dollars to be here and then you gotta spend 3 years in law school. It'd be way cheaper just to go on eBay or Facebook Marketplace and just like buy a law license from somebody, can't do it, right? Your professional license can be, cannot be given away, cannot be sold. By the way, so here's a pro tip, maybe out of date, don't know. I, uh, I got admitted in, uh, I think about 2009, so about 16 years old or 17 years old here. Um, back when I was doing it, probably still true. When you show up on the day to get sworn. Um, they give you an option, back then it was 20 bucks, probably it's like 30 bucks now, to sign up to get the fancy scroll indicating that you are a lawyer. Um, so there's a, you know, there's a document that you can just, yeah, back then you just pay 5 bucks and you got to actually get a thing they print off a laser printer. It doesn't look bad actually. You, you wait 10 minutes, they print it off on a laser printer, and it's OK. Hey, you're a lawyer, but you can pay the 20 bucks when I was doing it, a thing to get the scroll, and it like takes 6 months to get the scroll. Do it. The thing is huge and it is hand calligraphy. That's why it takes 6 months. It is like the best bargain in the law. You're getting this hand done thing. It's super, um, like it's way underpriced, uh, for what you're getting. So at least when I got it, so it's fantastic. Uh, now I, I just have it rolled up in a tube sitting in a closet somewhere, but I gotta say it's, it's nice to have. So just do that, um. Uh, strongly encouraged, uh, there also there is a, I hope they're still doing it, it's like one of the coolest things I think maybe the single coolest thing I've done, uh, as a lawyer. I didn't really practice, but, uh, is, uh, when you get sworn, um, after you do that you sit in this big room and they have you go down to the front of the room and you sign your name in the giant book of lawyers. It's an enormous volume. Um, and I'm sure they got like multiple volumes of this thing, and you put your name in it. I feel like, like writing your name in some like historic tome there. It's like, I don't know, it feels fantastic anyway, uh, something to look forward to. Now one of the things just keep in mind, right, that fancy scroll, if you get the fancy scroll, that's a bit of personal property. I could sell my scroll to you. I could give it away to you because that's not the license. The license is an intangible thing. This is why it's important to distinguish between tangible personal property and intangible personal property. The paper is just a bit of paper that looks good. The license is ineffable, intangible, OK. Um OK, so mosque says, look, The argument the majority makes is that certain things are taken, if you take certain things out of the bundle, then you don't have property anymore. And Ma says, yeah, we got other stuff that's property and we take those things out of the, you know, we take those same rights out of the bundle and nobody freaks out about that. There's still property, so I think it's still property. I, but, uh, that's a dissent. The majority concludes that under existing tort law there is no conversion liability. OK, so existing law says. Moore has no claim. That then raises the question. Should tort law be extended to give more claim? Alright, you know, when this stuff is being. You know, developed the, you know, the law of conversion goes back centuries, right? The notion of doing an operation to remove somebody's spleen or something is basically you just kill the patient, right, if you've done that. So, uh, you do not, young people today, I, I get it, I guess I, I kind of get it, uh, think that like this is like the worst time ever and this is like the hardest time ever. This is absolutely not. As an old guy, let me tell you, the past kind of sucked. Um, and I'm a guy who's more nostalgic than most, um, but if you like look at what medical science was like 100, 150 years ago, like the whole leeches thing, hey, you seem really sick. There's an imbalance of humors in your body. Let's attach leeches to you and bleed out some blood, and that's gonna cure something. People thought that was a good idea for a long period of time. All right, so. We have people like, we have a lot of those laws being developed when that is the understanding of medical science. So this whole, you know, doesn't, should we necessarily assume that it makes sense when applied to spleens? Maybe not. You know, we need to figure out what is the optimal rule for the spleen situation here, which probably wasn't contemplated in medieval England when they're doing the law of conversion. All right, so a question for you. Who should control the spleen after it's excised? And I'm. Um, and, so who should win here, right, um. Should uh More continue to have like ownership of the spleen after it's out or not? Quick show of hands here, how many people think that more should be entitled to own the spleen? OK, and how many people think that uh more should not be entitled on the plane? OK, so we got like about 40% thinks should, 30% thinks not, 30% is questioning their life choices about being here, um, OK, uh, somebody, so somebody in the majority here who thinks that, uh, so the majority will start a bigger group there, so we'll, uh, we'll warm up with these folks. Somebody thinks that more should own the plane. Why? But. Why is that? Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
Um, sorry. I was persuaded by the descent and I think, I think he should own the spleen just maybe from a morality standpoint of just like, you should be able to, like if he really wanted to go and shop around his spleen, like, like if he assuming that he got the knowledge that he could, I feel like that should be fine and like it was part of his body. It's still his body even though it's outside of his body. I get the temporal argument that they're making of like, or just the realistic like you cut off my my arm or something, it's not on me anymore, but it should like still be mine in the same way that this computer is mine even if I were to leave it at home today or just not with me.

SPEAKER 1
Alright, so interesting, the basic idea is, I think maybe I don't know, I, I don't wanna put words in your mouth, but just like, uh, the motivating impulse here is that certain things just when they start out being yours and clearly Moore's spleen is his while it's still in his body, right? No question about that, right? I think everyone would agree about that, um, um, then the fact that it's been removed from his body just doesn't seem to be a morally relevant distinction, right, um, just as you might say, you know. My iPhone is currently in my suit pocket. They need to design suits so that when the weight of the phone is in there, it doesn't like uh mess up the with the drape on the thing. I don't know how you do that, um, but, uh, uh, you know, it's in there. If it falls out, right, if I take it out, it shouldn't make it like cease to be my iPhone, right? So similarly, um, my spleen, I still have one, my bank, uh, my spleen is in there and it's when it's mine, and when you take it out, it shouldn't change. OK, so there's an argument just based on. Inside or outside just doesn't seem a morally relevant uh uh distinction and so therefore it shouldn't have any legal significance, yeah.

SPEAKER 3
It also feels like we treat organ donors differently. Like if you are, uh, if you are offering up your organs after you pass away, like you have to indicate that on your driver's license, and it needs to be like registered with the state and. So if someone gets into an accident and they haven't consented to it, you can't just say like, OK, we can take your liver and transfer it into someone else's body, even if it's for the good of science. Like there was, there's the consent part of that and like the underlying implication to me is that This person owns what is in their body and isn't able to just, it, it can't have it just be transferred because it could help others. Um, so I feel like they're, it's strange because it feels like we're we're treating organ donors differently than this situation and this person is also like still living. Um, and so like they could theoretically say like, that's my spleen. And someone else doesn't have that opportunity, but also like isn't able, it, it can be taken or I'm sorry, we don't take it from them. Just because they like aren't alive anymore. So I thought that that is odd, and I think I agree with Elizabeth. Like there's definitely a moral implication there, but I also don't fully understand why we treat those two things differently. All right, so good.

SPEAKER 1
So it's classic legal argument here. We've got a scenario we kind of saw examples of it here, right? We've got a particular scenario trying to figure out what the right answer is. This seems analogous to this other scenario where we are comfortable with the answer is. So we argue by analogy that uh so with organ donors we treat it a certain way, so we should treat it this situation the same way. Now, um, if you're. A more theoretically oriented, a great argument to make in court if you're a more theoretically oriented person, right, you may ask, you may say, well, that then just raises the question of whether the organ donor rules that we've got going on makes sense. All right, so there is a standard concern, right, that lots of good organs end up just going to waste because people have not. Indicate that they want to donate and so there's a question can we use various nudges to try to get them to donate, maybe use an um an opt out rather than an opt in, uh, system, um, how do you deal with this, right? So you might think that look, once you're dead you're gone, right? you say you can't take it with you, right? Um, and so maybe it'll be socially optimal to say, look, once you're dead. That's it. You are just, yeah, you're required to donate your organs, um, you know, lots of people, it turns out that it's kind of tragic. Lots of people who have checked the box, they're just old. Like probably my organs aren't that aren't that useful. Your organs super useful. Um, my organs, you know. Older you get, just that they're worn out, uh, the organs just aren't, uh, aren't that good, um, uh, and so a lot of you folks, uh, because you're not contemplating mortality, um, yeah, I probably haven't checked the box, but your organs are super useful, so maybe we should have a rule that just says, yeah, everybody's gotta be an organ donor, um, uh, that's not what we do, right? And there might be good reasons why we don't do it, but that's raising that sort of theoretical question, push it back like, oh, all right, so we've got an inconsistency here. But there's 2 ways if A is inconsistent with B, there's two ways of solving that. Make B consistent with A or make A consistent with B. Uh, yeah.

SPEAKER 4
I mean, I guess if we think about like the biology of an organ like eating and, and sleeping, those are like actions that take care of the organ and therefore you've almost put in the work to have the organ be what it is like and, and therefore, you know, that maybe endows you with some sort of property right to that organ because you've.

SPEAKER 1
You you engaged in spleen maintenance there, um, you know, you've, uh, been eating stuff that's good spleen health there. I don't know. You go to Whole Foods or something, you pay $10,000 for a thing of kale or whatever it is they charge. Like I just try not to think about it, um, the, uh, and it, you know, all sorts of stuff that promotes various good health on things. And so, yeah, OK, so you know your body was burning calories and doing stuff to do that. So maybe you've. Kind of labor-like on there, maybe something burn some energy there. uh, Mr. Min, was your hand up?

SPEAKER 5
Oh, can I argue for the other side? Yeah, I was about to turn to the other side,

SPEAKER 1
so great, you're just like one step ahead of me, younger, faster, better, good, go.

SPEAKER 5
Um, as sometimes like, uh, hypocritical the majority's argument was, I found it generally convincing because first of all, its judgment isn't just flatly saying there isn't any protection, they're offering an alternative to disclosure duty, and I think that's um a considerable nudge movement towards respecting the dignity and privacy of it all. And in that light, I mean, I might be wrong, but I feel like um the. This, the, the consent you need for um donating your organs work the same way. I'm like not sure if that's because you have a property interest for your own organs. I think it's the law is actually just recognizing like a privacy or dignity element. I feel free to, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like there might be a distinction there. And another like thing that I was thinking, like, so if I have a property right, like does that mean I get the right to just like, is it OK for me to chop my own hand off and like put it into my fridge? Like, could I perhaps one day go to court and argue for my right to sell my mutilated hand? Like it, like that's possible, right, that property is property. So I think it, um, opening up, I think property right is a very strong thing and opening up, especially in the context of something as controversial as human tissue, is almost like a slippery slope.

SPEAKER 1
Problem. Alright, so a couple of issues that are, uh, uh, arising on that. So I think 22 distinct ones. Let's deal with them in reverse order, right? So it's a question like if we say that it is property, then you need to worry about what are the implications of doing that more generally. Might give you the result you like in this case, but maybe once you've have established that, applied to other cases could be really bad, which is something really important to do in the law. All right, so one possibility is, well, if somebody chops off their hand, could they then like sell it online? Uh, I always pronounced it Van Gogh, I guess maybe Van Gogh or something. Uh, I don't know, but you know, Vincent Van Gogh, that guy. Right, chops off his ear, mentally ill, chops off his ear. Um, he was, I think, probably living in poverty at the time as those artists were, I don't really know, uh, the biography on that, but today, chopped off that ear, market for Van Gogh's ear, oh boy, that's like super valuable. There, should we allow that? That seems kind of not good, maybe. Um, we don't want to, uh, enable people to do that. There are concerns about people selling blood. So there is uh some places people sell blood, right? They, they, in order to get uh uh donations for blood banks, people that contribute blood, they'll pay people and typically it's poor people who are gonna go sell their blood. Is this bad? Um, there's actually interesting, uh, uh, literature, a famous study on Australia. Uh, where they did this, and it turns out that um if you pay people to donate blood, blood donations dropped overall because then people viewed this as not, oh, it's something I should do with a civic benefit, right? I have a civic duty to donate blood. It's like, oh no, this is a thing that, uh, you know, it has a price on it, right? It's a thing I could do and the price you're paying just isn't worth it to me, so I don't, so um. Uh, you could start to worry about, uh, what happens when you do those sorts of things. So there's a concern like chopping off stuff and do we wanna encourage the creation of markets that that's the commodification concern. Another concern is talking about the suggestion that, well, we could do, we can achieve these sorts of aims. Just as well by having the disclosure rules, right, and uh having the choice there. And here is maybe a distinction between this scenario. Um, and the organ donation scenario which you alluded to the possibility that might be some relationship or some distinction there, right? And so here's a possible distinction between them, and this is something that's touched upon by, um, Mosque and his descent which is. To what extent is this? Autonomy thing, the, hey, you can choose informed disclosure stuff. Real. Alright, um, there may be highly unfair bargaining situation here. I imagine somebody has been diagnosed with cancer. Um, my understanding from what I've read is that when people are told by a doctor. You have cancer, this thing is cancerous. Their immediate reaction is universally, get it out of me. Just get it out. Alright, um, when Moore went to UCLA, he was near death at that point, um, according to the court. So he's near death. He's been told, Well, you're going to die if we take your spleen out. Then maybe I'll buy you some time. Is he realistically gonna go, well, you know, but what sort of research are you planning on doing on my spleen? I'm doing this, like, well, I'm not sure that I, I, that's, you know, how happy I am with that. So maybe I'll go somewhere else, USC Medical Center maybe, and, uh, you might get a second opinion just because you want a second opinion before you do something as drastic as having your spleen out like is this medically optimal, but probably you're just focused on not dying. Rather than on, oh, let's think about the science stuff. This is a distinction maybe between the organ donor thing, which is typically, you know, if you get your driver's license, you check the box, you don't, you're not thinking I'm gonna be dying. Soon and even if you were, it's not like checking the box or not checking the box is going to give you any more life, right? So you may worry about unfair bargaining in this scenario, right? And so that may call into question the extent to which the informed informed consent stuff is really how how much consent is really going on. In that case, All right. Anyone else on the other side like the app?

SPEAKER 6
Yeah, I think, um, I would argue that, uh, your right to your body and body parts expire um after death, and I think in Maria's example about organ donation after a fatal crash, for example, the consent, uh, the, the thing that the rights you're signing away is. To the state really. Uh, it's saying that, um, you know, medical services or any state that has a well established, I guess, um, system and, and legislation for how to deal with this, obviously, not California in this case, but, uh, Um, assume that there's a, a state that does that, um, and then you're trusting, uh, this body of government to have, to know what's best for, to do with, uh, with the remainder of your body, right? Be it good parts, which, which could be You know, life saving for other people or bad parts which should be destroyed. Um, I think that's also the second part is also a, there's an argument that there is a very strong state interest in maintaining the public health because usually the body part that gets excised from somebody is, is bad body parts more than good, good ones.

SPEAKER 1
So yeah, so this, uh, I think ties nicely into, uh, one of the arguments that the court gives, the majority gives, uh, for why it is conversion law should not be extended here, right? They do a social balancing analysis and they say, well, on the one hand we've got the interest that Moore has in say privacy and dignity and concerns about that and maybe an interest in making some extra money if this thing ends up being super lucrative. On the other hand, we've got a social interest in scientists being able to conduct research without obstacles, especially in something like cancer research, cancer treatment research, and the court thinks that that concern, the social value of doing cancer treatment research is markedly. Greater overall than the value on the other side of the scale which is the individual uh uh yeah uh privacy and dignity concerns that more may have, especially since the court thinks that those can be addressed in other ways. With respect to the scientists, the concern that the court has is that if we give property rights to more here now, this makes it harder for the scientists to be able to do their kind of research because they have to now worry. Yeah, I, I'm not, I'm not scientifically trained at all, but I assume if you're doing research on this, you know, you go to, I need cells of a certain type to do some research on, and so I go to the big cell repository there and I say, OK, um, this is what I need, you know, sort of. Based on scientific things and they say, OK, these are the cells you want and you go ahead and you use that and maybe some money has to change hands or something for that. Yeah, you don't want the scientists to have to worry, oh dear, is like, is there some lurking. Um, non-consent claim out there that the person whose body these cells were taken from actually retains a property interest in it and then if I come up with some great breakthrough I'm gonna owe 30% or 50% of whatever I, you know, get from this to this person or not. I don't, I don't know what the property rights are on this. Do I need permission from this? I don't know, right? Property can lock up things. We talked about this in the assembly costs, assembly, um, problems, right? If you need to get. Consent from a bunch of people in order to do stuff that can keep you from doing socially productive things. So the court thinks that this might be an example of that, right, that we don't want to give the donors, the cell donors, exclusive rights on these things because that can impede scientific research too much and we care about this scientific research more than we care about the lingering concerns that uh uh. The donors might have after you've taken into account the fact that there's informed consent rules and adequate disclosures required and so forth. They also offer another, I'll just mention this before we take a break, um, the um. They offer another argument, which is an institutional and excuse me, an institutional competence argument. Which you will encounter time and again in the law and uh as lawyers you will try to ignore time and again I think um because it's natural uh in this line of work to think well here's a social problem courts should address this because we're lawyers so yes we should step in and do this but uh California Supreme Court says no you know, ultimately if we're gonna extend. The decision whether to extend the law of conversion to cover this situation or not is not there's no obvious answer to that. This is a fraught question. There's a bunch of policy arguments that can be made on both sides, and we've seen arguments in this room, right, on both sides. Um, and who is best situated to deal with this? The court says the legislature. Legislature has democratic legitimacy in the way that the courts don't. California Supreme Court actually you get to vote on the justices you can recall justices, um, in ways you can't with the US Supreme Court, but still it's, uh, the legislature is much more democratic. Um, and the legislature is better positioned. They can get expert testimony in various ways. They get, they may have some people who are actually doctors, right? They have, uh, um, they are better situated than courts are. People whose sole, you know, sole qualification for being on the bench, they went to law school and they knew somebody politically influential enough to get them nominated, right? Uh, you know, the old joke, what is a, um, Um What is a federal judge, a lawyer who knows a senator, right, um, the, um, uh, and yeah, they, the, the, that's not entirely wrong, um, the, uh, so there's an institutional competence argument here which says, you know, we should defer to legislatures on this. Justice, uh, Moss dissent, let's see, I, I covered that already. Oh yeah, he, um, so I'll just mention this because I've already put commodification on the board, so tie this in. Justice Mosque, uh, in dissent explicitly uses the term, raises this, um, uh, concern, says it's akin to slavery. To allow scientists and industrialists unquote the right to appropriate and exploit a patient's tissue for their sole economic benefit, unquote, worried that these folks are going to be making way too much money off of this, um, such research, I'm again quoting Mosque. Tends to treat the human body as a commodity, a means to a profitable end, unquote. So Moss seems to be really concerned that they're going to be making way too much money off this, and he's thinking that oh, the motivation for this isn't maybe the great aim of curing cancer or treating cancer better, but rather the aim of making. $3 billion adjusted for inflation, $7 billion a year on this and that he just, he, he thinks that's bad, um. And so we should maybe decrease those incentives. Now I gotta say, um, for various ailments like if, if I came up, came down with leukemia, I think I really wouldn't care what motivated the people to come up with the really thing, the thing that's really good for treating leukemia. I would just be happy that it existed, but maybe that's me. All right, maybe that's just me. Um. This issue of making a bunch of money. Potentially off something that somebody else gave but wasn't really involved, you know, they just gave like the precursor materials for this shows up in a related context and something that to use a term if you want to do a Google search on it, you can use this term. It is a very loaded term, um, so it's a it expresses a particular point of view and that's the bio piracy. Debate. So bio piracy by people who have a particular normative take on this. They talk about situations in a place like the Amazon in which there may be plants that grow only in a certain place and that place is occupied by various indigenous folks. And big pharma companies identify some element of those plants that's really useful for some drug that they make a lot of money off of. Should the pharma company be able to just take the plants and then make a gazillion dollars and not give any money to the indigenous folks? A variant on this. What if? The, the drug is like really great for treating migraines, right? And what if the local folks knew, or at least had thought, you know, they, they said like, part of their culture was eating this plant, chewing on this plant if you've got a migraine really is helpful. And so, you know, they're down there, they hear that and they, they take the plants, they test and they go, hey, it turns out that this bit of the plant here actually is really good for treating migraines. And so then they, you know, they make pills out of it and it's great for treating migraines, they make a gazillion dollars off of it. Should the locals be entitled to any money off that? All right, so that's, that's a question that arises here, right? In some sense. The plants being there, they're having that knowledge might be a necessary condition for this drug having been created. On the other hand, the amount of contribution they made to it may be not that huge relative to what the pharma company did. How do you apportion that? Oh, interesting question, deep question. Um. Footnote and then we will. Uh, take a break. Uh, so in case you're wondering what happened, uh, so Moore has the, um, uh, doesn't, uh, doesn't have a property rights, so he doesn't get to cash in on the billions of dollars that were not made because it turns out, uh, the, the research didn't actually go anywhere. There was, they were fighting over something that ended up not being a thing. Moore died in 2001 of leukemia. But That doesn't mean that the surgery was a failure. In fact, it was quite successful. He was near death when his spleen was removed. Um, he was diagnosed in 1976, 1976. He was near death when his spleen was removed. After it was removed, his cancer went into remission for 20 years. So, got an extra 2 decades on the planet as a result of the surgery. Worked pretty well. There's a, uh, there was a, um, uh, obituary for him in the Washington Post, which, uh, this guy did a lot of things in his life. I'll just mention like he confused me. He started a college in Guadalajara. He was a surveying engineer on the Alaska oil pipeline. He was a photographer for the city of Anchorage, ran a worm farm. He was did all sorts of stuff, so, you know, made, uh, made a lot of good use of the, uh, extra decades, uh, that he had there. Um, all of this is now quite possibly completely irrelevant as a practical matter. The way I found out about, uh, a few years ago when I had some minor, uh, surgery done and so I go in there and they're gonna do the minor surgery on me and they. To have some young doctor comes along and hand me, OK, you gotta sign the consent form, and I say, OK, I, I will do this, but I, I apologize. I always read these things before I sign them. I'm like, oh, that's, that's OK. Go, go ahead. And so I sit there I'm reading the thing and then I get to a provision that says, oh, anything they excise from my body, it's just a generic form, anything they excise from my body, they can do scientific research on, and I am entitled to nothing. I waive all of my rights to this. And then the poor doctor was then inflicted to an impromptu lecture from me on Moore versus the Regents of University of California as to why that provision was in there. He's like, yeah, just sign the thing, dude, you know, and so I did, and so I signed it, and so there we are, um, so as a practical matter, even if you had a property right, you can contract around that, right, because property is transferable and, and you know I was in the emergency room. Am I really going to go, well, you know what, I don't like your plans on this, so put me on another ambulance, take me somewhere else where they're probably gonna have the same thing. How much choice is there really here? All right, that's a thought to leave you with as we, uh, take a break here. We come back, we will talk about trespass the land.

SPEAKER 0
Uh, see you folks in 10 minutes. Yeah It is not gonna look annoy. right. OK. Fs. Less problematic. Because, um. There are multiple ways to say. donors say a sperm donors. Apparently that's a common thing, soldiers going off to war now. sperms back. So But uh don't come back, um, like it's still a progeny. um, uh, but barring that, right, um, this is, uh, something where it's like, yeah, you know, you, you could have, you could have kids in various ways and so

SPEAKER 1
just the social stakes seem less there, and even if you couldn't, it's like one person can't have kids. get a cure for cancer. That helped a lot of people. So when the stakes are lower, I think the thought that you can have. It doesn't cost as much to give property rights to things, um, use property, uh, give people exclusive rights to things. I think, um, has some, has more purchase than it would in this kind of situation. But the law last I saw, I was actually pretty

SPEAKER 7
unsettled on that topic. Yeah, I was looking, I'm sorry, I'll back, um, because there was a. Or not really a case, but in Thailand, I don't know if you've heard of the twins in Thailand where it was a family, a couple, I think it was an American couple or Western couple who hired a Thai woman who carried twins. One twin had Down syndrome, one did not, and then.

SPEAKER 0
Only non baby, they, they offer, they offer like additional

SPEAKER 7
money to the, uh, pregnant woman to have twins, but then once they found out that it doesn't, then they were like, oh, that's not a baby.

SPEAKER 0
It's your baby now. I was wondering like that's a really interesting thing.

SPEAKER 1
Wow, yeah, I mean, so that's, so family, so talk

SPEAKER 0
to your family law prop and take family law. Like if you're interested in this, you should take family law, um, because like one of the principles of family law, which I think now, maybe the progressive don't want to do, I don't know anyway, is best interest of the of the resulting child, and it's not clear that if, um, Yeah, yeah, in some sense, if you've got

SPEAKER 1
a kid with Down syndrome.

SPEAKER 0
Being, uh, having parents who are wealthy enough to be

SPEAKER 1
able to pay for this stuff is probably good. On the other hand, the parents. That's probably bad. How do you deal with that situation?

SPEAKER 7
That's a really interesting case because you probably can't have an abortion that would have killed you. Other kid, uh, so that's a great case.

SPEAKER 1
I don't know how you, how you deal with it.

SPEAKER 7
Um, so that's a. The, the, uh, the Down syndrome. Really? OK, so. I will editorialize. Good for the Thai woman.

SPEAKER 1
My concern, I have concerns for the soul of the,

SPEAKER 7
uh, parents.

SPEAKER 1
That is just me editorializing. That is 100%, uh, you, you, you, you are for anything I say, you are not only entitled to disagree, you are encouraged to disagree. But, um, yeah, I mean, that's, um, I, that does raise like issues that also just arise with fertility and how you can have traits. So I remember when I was in law school. I probably should. I run off to refill my water bottle in a minute. Like here we have lockers. I Remember one day in the locker, somebody posted a flyer, um, soliciting egg donations. But they were like listing all the uh requirements for this, yes, and so they were doing it very much

SPEAKER 0
it was Yale Law School, right, because they wanted an Ivy League, baby, they didn't wanna, you know. Ohio state law, baby, right, um, and you know, how should the law treat that? That's uh. That's a good question, right? So it's a legal question, it's a moral question, religious, a theological question, right, um. And I would, I would feel about, uh, if you're interested. Some points you have to run the paper. An unsettled area of the law and Yeah, I, I thought it really nice. Thank you. I was.

SPEAKER 1
I am going to have to not talk to you now because I need to refill the water bottle so I saw by the end of the class.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah you Yeah OK folks, let's get back into this

SPEAKER 1
here. So so far we've been talking about how one comes to acquire property and we've touched upon the question of what sorts of things should be owned as property, um, but we haven't really talked about what ownership gives you like what is it like that you get if you got this thing, right, um, and so we're gonna turn that topic down and one of the central rights that is involved in property. Is the right to exclude other people from what is yours. From occupying a property or possessing it or using it or doing things with it without your permission and so we have a a case that is an example of this in the context of real property. Jacques F Steinberg Holmes, Supreme Court of Wisconsin 1987, check that 1997, page one. Wow, we've been going for like 3 weeks and all we are at page one of the casebook. We're so slow. Um, the, uh, no, we're doing this, uh, so I've, uh, arranged the course in the, uh, order that seems to make sense to me. Uh, the casebook authors have arranged the casebook in the order that makes sense to them. Um, it is useful to think from time to time about how lectures are really, how, you know, uh, class presentation, how syllabi are arranged, and also how. Table of contents are arranged in the casebook in casebooks. Here I don't think that this is a, it is a coincidence that Jacques V. Steinberg Holmes is on page one. Jacquevi Steenberg Holmes and the punchline is that you have a strong right to exclude. Right, um, the, um, uh, one view of property is that the right to exclude is absolutely central to it. That view is, I think, typically associated with various people, but perhaps the most prominent proponent of it is Columbia's own Tom Merrill, who is the Merrill in Merrill and Smith, um, here, um. And uh who if you uh have a chance, if you're interested in property at all and you have a chance to take a class with him, I highly encourage it. Also, like I think of this guy as like a famous property guy and he is, but I think many other people think of him as a famous like admin law guy or con law guy because he's also that too. He's one of the very few academics who's famous in like two completely different fields, um, but that's because he's super competent, um, so he's associated with the idea that, um, uh. The right to exclude is absolutely fundamental to property, right, um, and I think, uh, I think Henry Smith, I think probably agrees with that too, and, uh, Molly Brady, Maureen Brady might, don't know, uh, she's the most recent edition of the casebook. Uh, all right, so the setup for this is straightforward. Um, Harvey and Lois Jack, Jacque have a neighbor. The neighbor bought a mobile home from Steenberg Homes, uh, in 1983. Just one thing to note, this incident occurs in 1983. Wisconsin Supreme Court is addressing this in 1997. There has been 14 years of litigation about somebody delivering a mobile home across somebody's property. Demonstrating once again the fundamental rule of the law and of the universe, lawyers get paid. Just think of all the hours that were billed for this. All right, um, so. In 1983, they buy a mobile home. It was going to be used as a summer cottage. Steenberg Homes screwed up when they did their pricing model because the price of the home included delivery, free delivery of the home. Turns out when it comes time to deliver the home, which they do during winter, the road leading to the neighbor's property was not ideal for delivering a mobile home. It had up to 7 ft of snow on it, so our recent snowfall that was fairly big for New York City, that was 10 inches, 7 ft is 84 inches, so you can imagine that. So that's not so great. Also, the, the road had a really sharp turn in it, which makes it difficult to deliver like a mobile home around that turn. So Steenberg comes, when they get to the road, they see that problem and they go, OK, uh, that's not good, but we got this property right here that we could just cut across, and that would make it safe and easy. So, they wanted to do that. The Jacques property was approximately 170 acres in size, so what on earth does that mean? Well, if the lot were square, it would be about 15 mile by 15 mile. Right, um, so it's approximately 1/5 the size of Central Park if that means anything to you, or if you're familiar with Columbia University beyond the law school, which, you know, you may well not be because you're in law school, but, uh, if you're thinking about the Morningside Heights campus, right, so just the, the full Morningside Heights campus, it's about 5 times as large as Columbia's Morningside Heights campus, right? It's a pretty big parcel. And they want to cut across it, so they ask, hey, can we cut across and the jocks say no and they say, hey, can we cut across? Really? We'd really like to know. OK, we'll pay you some money and the jocks say no, we're just not gonna let you go across. Uh, according to the court, they had a reason. They, they asserted a reason for saying no, we do not want to let you go across. What was that reason? What did they claim was their justification for saying no? We're not gonna let you go Uh, mister, is it Hirsch, Mr. Hirsch?

SPEAKER 2
Uh, yeah, they were worried about adverse possession, right, so

SPEAKER 1
they, they claim that they were, uh, they had lost some property in the past by adverse possessions. Uh, we're, we're skittish about that. We don't wanna allow this, um, if you were the Jacque's lawyer. How severe a risk do you think that would be? We've now done adverse possession, one of the few things we've done, so now you have, have some knowledge of stuff here. Uh, is it Mr. Krannitz? I think that risk would be very low, right? And why is that?

SPEAKER 8
Uh, because there's pretty much no way it would take a statutory amount of time for them to cross that land. All right, so one problem you've got here is that,

SPEAKER 1
uh, we don't know what the statute, at least I don't know what the statute of limitations was in, uh, Wisconsin at this time, but presumably. Moving our mobile home across the property there, yeah, can't take more than a day or two, it probably takes a couple of hours, um, and, uh, whatever the statute is, it's gonna be longer than that. The shortest statute of limitations, I think, in, in the United States is 5 years. It was not gonna take 5 years to deliver the home. OK, so not gonna, the statute of limitations wasn't gonna be. Um, uh, triggered there, uh, is it Ms. Rosen Zweig, Rosen, how do I, how does Rosenzweig, Rosenzweig,

SPEAKER 9
yeah, there's also the adverse requirement isn't met because if they had permission to cross then it wouldn't be adverse and so there'd be no risk of adverse possession, right?

SPEAKER 1
So also this wasn't adverse, right? You give permission and it's not contrary to the jock's rights, it's consistent with the jock's rights. So basically the risk of adverse possession here was zero. But they claimed, hey, I'm, I'm worried, and you know, people are worried about things, they worry about all sorts of stuff. I am an anxious person. I worry about many things, um. Middle aged dude here, so of course I enjoy Tom Petty's music. I don't know if anybody like Tom, that's just like I'm that's what I am, but he has a great line. I'm so tired of being tired. Sure as night will follow day. Most things I worry about never happen anyway. It, um, uh, and so you know that's true for a lot of people, right, but you're worried about it, so they claim they weren't gonna do it. All right, so then Steenberg Homes has got a problem because they, you know, they're trying to get permission, they can't get permission, but if they just follow the road that's gonna suck. So they deal with this dilemma in the traditional American way. They say screw it, we're gonna do it anyway, right? So they just go charging across, uh, the Jacque's property and they deliver the home. All right, um, the Jacques promptly called the sheriff and sue. Sheriff arises, arrives, imposes a $30 fine on Steinberg Holmes, fines him $30 and the lawsuit results in the trial court awarding $1 in compensatory damages. Why so low? That doesn't seem like a very big amount of money. Why is that? Yeah.

SPEAKER 8
Well, it's like nominal damages, right? So you have to give, you have to choose something because otherwise it's like they're, it's tantamount to saying that nothing happened, but, you know, in a literal sense, they were there for like, you know, not that much time. It's not like they were depriving the uh jocks of like mining or something, so that's like, that's probably approximates the value of the time they lost. If anything, it's too high.

SPEAKER 1
Alright, OK, so the, um, so the reason why they got $1 in damages is because it's nominal damages because there were no actual d no actual injury to compensate. Right, um, the, uh, is what the trial court's saying. The Trial court's saying, look, there's, there's no harm here, right? So it's not like the property was damaged. Given how much snow was on the ground, it sounds to me like it is entirely plausible that in delivering the mobile home, at no point did Steenberg Homes even actually touch the dirt that constitutes the land there, right? They're probably just touching packed snow that was going to melt off. Um, so there's no actual injury and so one thing that happens, the courts will do. There's no actual injury, but they want to vindicate the rights of the plaintiff. Sometimes they will award nominal damages. Nominal damages are designed not to be compensatory. They are just some symbolic award, typically $1. Sometimes you'll see $5. If you see a somewhat older case, sometimes you will see 6 cents is awarded as nominal damages. The point is you just give a one size fits all. This is a, here's here's a token. Alright, so they award $1 in nominal damages, but they also, the trial court also awards $100,000 in punitive damages. Adjusting that for inflation, that's about $200,000 in today's money. All right, which is a lot, right. So Steinberg Homes conceded trespass on appeal, which I mean they pretty much had to, as probably everybody saw them. Pretty hard to hide the fact that you're driving a mobile home across somebody's property there. So yeah, OK. They trespassed, but they argued that there could be no punitive damages because there were no compensatory damages or only nominal compensatory damages, and they invoke a traditional rule that says absent any actual damages you can't get compensatories, you can't get punitives, excuse me. So the court says the issue is as follows for an intentional trespass, can punitive damages be awarded even if there's no compensatory actual damages, or there were only nominal damages? And the court says yes, yes they can. The question is how do you get there? Um, why not have just apply the traditional rule and so the court does something that's standard in the law. It says, well, we've got an old rule and we've got a sort of new situation here. Let's figure out the motivation behind the old rule and see if that motivation applies in this case. So we're gonna see what function the old rule served and see if that function applies to these facts. Um, and the court says that the, and it's pretty standard analysis the court gives here about what, why do we have punitive damages in general and tacit assumption, standard assumption, not standard but tacit assumption here is that the purpose of punitive damages is to deter socially undesirable conduct. I want to deter people from doing things that are socially bad. But it's not important for society to deter injuries that act that cause no actual harm to people. Right, so there's no need for punitive damages in such cases, right, so that's the general rule. But the court rejects that as is inapplicable or inapposite if you wish to intentional torts, not accidental torts, but to intentional torts. And it gives a hypo that it takes from an 1814 case in England, Mears versus Harvey. The hypothetical that the merest court gave was suppose that you have a house and you have a nice house and it has a dining room and it has a nice picture window in it, so a big plate glass window in it, and right outside that you have a walkway, and let's imagine the walkway is paved, right, so you have a nice paved walkway. And you're sitting down and you're eating dinner with your family, and some stranger just walks onto your property, walks onto the paved walkway, and starts staring at you as you're eating your dinner, just walking along, peering in, you know, gets to the end of the window, turns around, comes back, and they're just peering in as you're trying to eat your dinner, and that's all they do, right, um, they're walking on the walkway. So they're not actually damaged like, so it's concrete, right, or stone, so they're not actually dam causing any damage to it whatsoever. Um, they're staring at you but they're not physically harming you in any way, they're not touching the window or anything. There's no damage. Uh, today we might say there's a privacy tort there, but they didn't have that in England in 1814. That's not what we're worried about here, so that doesn't. That set that aside, it looks like if the rule were there's no punitive damages, absent actual damages, you couldn't actually get anything against that trespasser. Um, quoting then quotes Mist, that case is saying that if the defendant, the trespasser, won't act like a gentleman. Then heavy damages are required to deter it. So the idea is then in this case, if Steenberg Holmes won't act like a gentleman, heavy damages are required to deter it. OK, so far so good, but 1 may ask. Did the Jacques act like a gentleman in refusing to allow transit of the mobile home across the property? I recall what the Jacques did, right? According to the court, they repeatedly refused requests for permission to go across the property. They refused an offer to pay. For that permission. They called neighbors and the town chairman over to witness the trespass. Hey, look at what's happening. And when they came over, the jocks had a map and a plat book. A plat book is a book. It's like at the county land office. It, it, uh, shows like where everybody's property lines are. So they got the map and the plat. Look, they're going on our property here. Look at this. Look at this. Right, um, a term that you will sometimes you see used in the, in the literature, people ordinarily use it too, is was the Jacque's behavior neighborly. Was this neighborly behavior here, um, and if not, if the Jacques weren't acting like gentlemen, then why isn't the law concerned to deter that ungentlemanly behavior? Why focus solely on deterring the ungentlemanly behavior of Steenberg homes? Should the law instead promote, say, neighborly accommodation? Um, Phrasing it in a different way, was the Jacques's behavior really reasonable? To what extent should the law accommodate unreasonable wishes, and property law says, at least sometimes, that the law should be very accommodating of owner's wishes, even if they're unreasonable. Even if the Jacques were completely unreasonable, the law says nope, we're going to accommodate that. The court says that the real harm here was harm with the loss, the Jacques' loss of their right to exclude. Right. Whether they should have chosen to exclude or not is irrelevant. They had a right to exclude. They lost that when Steinberg Holmes went across without permission. That is non-trivial, that the court thinks is good enough to justify an award of $100,000 in punitive damages. Um, So Punchline of this case, you have a really strong right to exclude if you're a property owner, even if doing so is unreasonable. Now there's a footnote if you know something about remedies law, a footnote on this, uh, this case was decided before State Farm versus Campbell was decided by the US Supreme Court. State Farm Court said that punitive damages awards in excess of a ratio of 9 to 1. Um, 9 to 1 punitive to compensatories are presumptively suspect, constitutionally suspect, so there might have been a problem. Post Campbell State Farm versus Campbell with this because 100,000 to 1 is bigger than 9 to 1. I know he went to law school so he wouldn't have to do math, but trust me, 100,000 is bigger than 9, so, uh, there might have been a problem with that. But even State Farm says that's only a presumption, that's a defeasible presumption, so you could, you could exceed it. All right, um. All right, any questions on this? Alright, great. I wanna just wanna finish with a quick show of hands because I'm, I'm out of time, so I gotta let you go here. How many people here think this case was rightly decided? Hold your hands up high. Like if you think it was rightly decided, you should have front. OK. How many people think it was wrongly decided? All right, we've got enough of a divergence. When we come back next class, we're gonna talk about that. Alright, what the scale, what the outcome should have been.

SPEAKER 0
All right, have a great weekend.

SPEAKER 1
See you folks next Tuesday.
