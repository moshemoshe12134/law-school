SPEAKER 0
Thank you.

SPEAKER 1
Alright. Jesus Christ. I know. That's right. I wouldn't last week. That's actually a really Wow, you folks are really well

SPEAKER 0
trained. It is exactly 10 minutes ago, uh, 10 minutes to the hour. We're right at the start point, and you have fallen into expectant hush. Fantastic. Thank you very much. All right, welcome back, everybody. Um, I still don't have a seating chart, uh, yet. Is the seating chart open now for you to put your. Come on. Yeah, well, so, yeah, but, uh, like, so like I have to do something to let you. All right, I will talk to my assistant, yeah, about that, so, um. So. Well, I mean, I'll, I'll tell, oh, I see, so what? Right, OK, I will, I will, I will ask my assistant to make it open. Tomorrow at noon I'm guessing I will make an announcement. I will do a canvas announcement for when it is and if you know. We got the, the line standers, right? People, you can pay people to stand in line for you. So you could pay somebody to be up at 4 a.m., give them your ID, they log in, probably violate some terms of service, get you kicked out of law school, but we'll get you that sweet seat, uh, for that one class. All right, um. Aska. To open seating chart. I don't know that uh picking a time is actually a feasible thing so I will, I will, I will contact my, I will place the request with my faculty assistant and then things will happen. I have no control over any of it, so who knows, but I, but I hope that that will become, um, you know, become evident, um. The start of today, they wouldn't even let me in the building, so I'm like taking this, uh, I am, uh, working my way up to actually having, uh, I managed to talk my way past security. I was also the, the ID card eventually worked but it took a while, um. All right, uh, 01 bit of it is mildly administrative business. Not really, but, uh, it's the closest I have to admin stuff today. I'm just talking about this course and, um, study aids for these things, uh, because I've, I've taught here once before two years ago. And I have, uh, taught for many years at Brooklyn, uh, and you may know people at Brooklyn. Uh, so you may have access to notes or outlines from previous iterations of this course. Um, if you do, I have no idea how students get them, but at some point it appears that students do sometimes get them. If you do, that's fine. I don't care. Again, I don't care how you learn. I just care that you learn. But just do be aware that I tinker with the course every year, so the farther back in time you go, the more likely it is that there will be a disconnect, a greater disconnect between what was in the course and then and what's in the course now. Right, I don't. This course is fairly refined, so I generally don't do major tinkering, but, uh, new editions of the casebook will lose some cases and add some cases, and, uh, this year I'm thinking there will probably be a bonus unit that I've never taught before, so we'll do that in one class toward the end and so yeah, there'll be some changes, just be aware of that, um, when you're doing it. And also be aware if you're using outlines from somebody else, right? For all you know, you are getting an outline from the absolute worst student, uh, in the law school, right, who did it you have no idea how good these people are, um, so just, you know, use with caution. OK, we begin last class by, uh, at least, well, it was a bunch of administrative stuff, and then when we finally got to our substantive discussion, um, we started to consider some fundamental issues in property law as a social institution. We discussed the hypothetical property rights, put property in scare quotes if you want in places in line, right, and we touched upon some basic policy considerations, many of which we'll see recur throughout the course. One of them, whether there should be property rights to positions in line. Should a line stander be able to exclude other people from that position once you've got it, um, if you think that there should be property rights of some sort to a place in line, what do those rights include? What is the scope of those rights? Should a line stander be able to sell or give or otherwise transfer? Uh, his or her position in line to somebody else. Um, another consideration on what basis should property rights be allocated? If we're going to say that you people should be entitled to have property rights of some sort to a place in line, who should get them, right? Uh, being first, is that the way we should allocate it? Uh, Having the money to pay for it, is that the way we should allocate it? Having the time to invest in acquiring it, is that how we should allocate it? Something else. And then finally, what institution should decide what those rules should be? Should it be custom, you know, the practice of like people in the area or people in that business? Should it be the government setting laws for that? Should it be maybe the owner of the, in the example I gave you, the theater where things happen? Is that the person who said it? Somebody else, how do we decide these things? Uh, by the way, I may have missed, I, I'm, I. Worry I obsess about things after I've I've done them. I may have missed, I may have said the wrong name for the wrong play that I was trying to go see. It was not, if I said it was Hamlet, I was wrong. It was Macbeth. I was trying to see Macbeth. It's easy for me to forget that since I didn't get to see it. I just stood in line the entire time. But anyway, it was Macbeth. Um, how many people here have seen Kenneth Branner's Henry the Fifth? You are missing out. All right, it's not on the exam, I cannot require it, but man, I can urge you to see Brenner's Henry the Fifth. Fantastic film. All right, um. Today we're gonna start by talking about one of the great chestnuts of property law. 20 years from now, the one thing you will remember about property law is, oh yeah, there's a case about a fox. So we're gonna do the fox case, very famous case about a fox, Pearson against Post, New York Supreme Court, 1805, I think. Yeah, 1805, page 54 in the case book here. Uh, at this point in your legal education, you probably, I assume, are aware of the fact that the New York Supreme Court is not the highest court in New York. It is a low-level court. The highest court in New York is the Court of Appeals. Very few states still name their courts that way, but New York's an outlier, and so we still do. All right, so this is a trial court. This is just a case in a trial court. Basic facts here is the Post in Pearson against Post is a guy with an awesome name, Lotowwick Post. Don't be many Lot of works nowadays. If you're planning on having kids anytime soon or know somebody who is, perhaps encourage them to name their kid Lottawick. Um, Lottaick Post is out fox hunting on, quote, the beach. Unquote. Starts chasing a fox. Ultimately there is a dispute over who owns the fox the Post was chasing. OK, 2 questions for you to start off here. What was the beach like? So what was the beach? And why does that matter legally? Why do we care? And again I apologize. I'm gonna have to just like being rude and just pointing at people because it's none of the, don't know the chart. Yeah I'll do it. Um, the beach was a wild, uninhabited, unpossessed wasteland. Um, I think it wouldn't matter because you're sort of thinking about whether or not someone owns that beach or whether the things that are on that beach can be claimed by anyone in the surrounding areas if there's any like inhabitants of the beach. OK. First half, aces, Second half, all right, but uh there's a little bit more you could say. All right, so, um, so first half, so right, uh, the characterization of the beach is correct. It is wild, uninhabited wasteland. It's just like, you know, some scrub stuff out there. It's not a beach like the Baywatch Beach, Baywatch before your time, but anyway, uh, it's, uh, you know, it's not, uh, not by the seashore there. It's, uh, just this, you know. Kind of wasteland there that nobody else. All right, now as to why it doesn't, why it matters legally, there's a bit of Latin, our first bit of Latin, definitely are not, not our last bit of Latin, uh, that we will have actually, I guess we had corpus uro secundum yesterday, so our last class, so maybe our second bit of Latin, uh, there's a Latin term that's associated with this that is relevant here. So why do we care? Why does it matter legally that this action occurred on the beach? Yeah Um, because it wasn't owned by a private party, OK, so the fact that it's not owned is the key element of the beach here, right? The key legal element, the fact that it's kind of wasteland and like it's like stuff's not really growing there, turns out to be legally irrelevant. The legally critical bit is that it's not owned. Why does that matter? Why do we, it's like, OK, it's not owned. Why does that matter for our Fox case? Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Because then there could be an argument potentially made where if you own the land and there's an animal or a creature on it, then the person who owns it has, has a claim over the animal, right?

SPEAKER 0
OK, so there's a bit of doctrine. That existed at the time uh. Went under a Latin term. Uh, if There's a wild animal that appears on land that is owned by somebody. The owner of the wild, the wild animal is owned at that moment by the person on whose land the animal appears. That animal is owned by the owner of the land, Rone Soli. By reason, ratio, rational, right, the Latin root for that, all that stuff, uh, solely of the earth, right, on the ground, all right, um, by, uh, reason of, by virtue of owning the ground, you own the animal on it, right? So a basic question of property law is how does somebody come to own something. One answer to that is that you come to own X because X is related to Y and you already own Y. Right. There's a relationship between the thing in question and something else that you already own, and that relationship is such that you own it. That uh you own uh both of them. You see this, we will not actually have uh uh a unit on this. I used to do it, then I took it out just because uh we just don't have time, um, but their doctrines of this goes under the name of accession. Um Tom Merrill of Columbia Law School has written a bunch on accession. Um, uh, basically the idea is that if you own one thing you own something else related to it. So all sorts of obvious examples that you're already familiar with. You own the tree, you own the fruit that comes off the tree. You own the cow, you own the calves that are uh spawned by the cow, right? You own the chicken, you own the eggs, right. The egg is different from the chicken, but nevertheless, you, because you own one, you own the other. All right, so we have this doctrine that exists that says that uh if it's uh a wild animal appears on land that somebody owns, then the owner of the land owns the wild animal. Now that's going to the court mentions that because it has to set that in because everyone at the time would have known that, and they say that that's not going to resolve this particular dispute. Right, so the majority's legal reasoning, we have a majority and a dissent in this case, the majority's legal reasoning starts by saying foxes are wild by nature, Fri natura. My pronunciation again is this weird like bad classical pronunciation, right? Uh, you'll hear other like Frenatu or something. It's, it's land's been around for a long time is also the pronunciations. They're all fine. All right, um, Ferra natura. Animals are wild by nature, so if they are not owned ratone solely, if they're not owned by virtue of just being on somebody else's land. On somebody's land, then property rights will exist in those animals, you'll own those animals, quote, by occupancy only, unquote. Occupancy is an old fashioned term for what we would today call possession. So, um, if the animal's just out there in the middle of nowhere on land not owned by anybody, possession is going to determine who owns the animal. So this is another answer to how you can come to own something. First possession. Right, if you're the first to possess it, then you own it. That's true in the case of wild animals. Here the court tells us, but that then raises the further question of what constitutes first possession, right? So you go, oh, first possession, right, write that down. OK, got it, get on my notes. First possessor gets it, great, but law is hard, which is good for you because billable hours are undefeated, right? Uh, uh, what does it mean to be the first possessor? Right, um, so the issue in this case is a version of that, an instance of that. For wild animals, what constitutes occupancy or possession? So, the reason why this issue shows up is because there's more than one person in this story. So along with Lodwick Post, we've got Jesse Pearson. Pearson, um. Is uh present on the scene, knew that Post was chasing after the fox, saw that the fox happens to go nearby Pearson. Pearson then kills and carries off the fox, in the words of the court, quote, to prevent, unquote, Post from getting it. Now it's so Pearson sees the fox. Jumps in, grabs the fox to stop Post from getting it. Post then sues Pearson. All right, so you can see the dispute. Who is entitled to the fox? Now we've got some law that's in there and you've probably written it down, you're reading notes, whatever, that's great. We will talk about that in a bit, but I want to ignore it for the moment here. I'm gonna ask you a question and I am not asking you what the court said. The question I'm going to ask you is who should own the fox. Right, and I'm. We, we've got a majority and a dissent. We'll work through all of that, but you know they could have gotten it wrong, right? How do you know whether they get it right or get it wrong, right? This is property as an institution. It, we, we, it's artificial. We make it up. So what should the rules be here? Who should own the fox and why? Who do you think? You presumably had some intuition as you're reading the story.

SPEAKER 2
I mean, I don't agree with his morals, but like I think Pearson because he shot it first should own it. Alright, so, so what?

SPEAKER 0
So why does the fact that he shot it first?

SPEAKER 2
I just think like of childish games like tag you're it, like if someone hits it first or whatever, like, like if someone gets you like you're it. Like I don't know. That's literally what I think of.

SPEAKER 0
OK, so you could have an argument. So one argument is that uh we're very used to the idea. Of somebody whoever gets to something first gets the thing, all right, very familiar idea. Um, why might that be advantageous in a legal system to have rules based on that? It might be, yeah.

SPEAKER 3
It's easier to define, so it's easy to say, OK, this person shot the animal or has the animal in their possession, quite literally, and therefore it's easier to define than someone who is in pursuit. That's a little bit more vague and someone just looking at a wild animal could be theoretically in pursuit.

SPEAKER 0
OK, so, uh, a couple of, uh, different ideas coming out of that, so closely related ideas here, right, so one is a term you may have encountered before, um, the notion of administrability, right, judicial administrability. If you're gonna have a, a rule in a legal system, legal systems are administered by courts, it is useful to have a rule that a court can actually, as a practical matter, kind of apply relatively straightforwardly. And it may be relatively straightforward to go, well, you know, who's the person who actually shot the fox and, you know, who's the person who walks into court carrying the fox, the fox carcass? Well, we could figure that out pretty easily, and I just look and see who it is, and that may make sense. Another related idea is that it could be useful for participants in a legal system outside the courts, just ordinary people governed by the legal system, to have some idea of who's entitled to what and to be able to figure that out pretty easily. And pretty cheaply. And it may be that, well, you know, if somebody actually walks off with the fox, you know, you could just look and see. All right, that makes sense. That's, that's, that's a good reason there, right? Everyone has a pretty good idea of who owns what, and that can be advantageous for planning and for uh uh uh um just generally getting along, right? Is there a hand? Yes, hand up.

SPEAKER 4
I think also here we're thinking about sport but just something else like in the context of competition you would want a rule that kind of promotes competition in this way if you um only allow one person or if you say that the person that starts to chase the fox gets the fox, then you wouldn't have any competition. I can think of in a macro sense. Like in the context of like finding cures to diseases, if you say that the first person to start researching the cure to a disease gets the patent for that disease, that doesn't necessarily make for the most optimal solution.

SPEAKER 0
All right, OK, so we've got a, uh, an idea. So, uh, we've got a nice other idea, counterpoint idea. So the first idea was very uh Tompkins. Ask the majority right talks about the importance of uh uh for the sake of certainty and of uh uh uh reducing disputes, it's going to do uh uh state of rule right and rule in the way it does here we've got an idea that sort of sounds kind of like the dissent, right, uh, Livingston's dissent in which we want to give incentives to productive activity. Um, and so how do we maximize giving incentives to productive activity? Well, it may be that, uh, you want the, you, if you define the productive activity. As catching the fox. Then you want to basically reward people who catch the fox, as opposed to people who try to catch the fox and fail. So we want to give incentives to people who are good at this to do it, and maybe people who are not so good at it to choose some other path in life, uh, to follow. Um, there is a famous phrase I should know who said it and I don't. I think it's in a court, maybe in, maybe in an academic paper, I don't know, you mentioned patents, right? And so, um, there is a famous line that says a patent is not a hunting license. Right, so a patent is a reward for actually having invented the thing, not for having tried really hard to invent the thing. And that is in fact the way the patent system works, right? We give rewards to people who actually are, well, not the first to file, but, uh, basically the person who's the first to invent, right? Uh we give rewards to inventors, not people who tried hard, um, even if they worked much harder than the person who actually did. All right, so there may be a social benefit. In having a rule that basically says the person who succeeds is the one who gets it. Um You know what they say about the person who's 2nd place, 1st loser, right? Um, now, interestingly, all right, so this is an incentive-based argument, but we'll, we'll talk about Livingston's descent in a bit, but that's sort of the opposite conclusion that Livingston draws, uh, from that incentive-based argument. So we'll, we'll, we'll talk about that. I think I saw another hand, but I don't, yeah.

SPEAKER 5
Um, I, I wonder like with the example of the fox, right, what comes to mind for me is like the lock, lock's whole idea of like the, you know, clearing the land and then therefore you acquire a right to it. And I think the analogy of the patent is kind of not misleading, but it, I feel like you have to sort of set like, uh, situate what the fox is like in these analogies, right? Because You know, a patent, the whole idea is like this is a unique thing, right? Whereas a fox, it's not unique in the same way where like, you know, what Locke's whole idea was premised on that there was not a scarcity of lands to develop, right? So if I develop land. Someone comes in, builds a house on it, and says it's their land now, obviously I'm gonna take umbrage with that. Whereas, you know, like a patent is different, and I think the fox is more similar to the, to Locke's example just because, you know, maybe in this, in this area, there was a dearth of foxes, right? Maybe this is one of 3 foxes, I don't know, but if there was a bunch of foxes, I think you, you'd want to lean on the side of, um, um, rewarding those who invest resources to develop something.

SPEAKER 0
Alright, so there's an issue about, uh, the nature of the resource that's being claimed, right, and we do not, uh, unfortunately we do not have time to do intellectual property in this course. So, if you're feel free to sigh if you want to do it. I used to have a unit intellectual property, and it's just like you, you just can't do it. It's just like there's just no way you can do it, uh, in a course like this. But one of the, uh, key ideas, uh, underlying debates about intellectual property, thinking about intellectual property is the fact that intellectual property is non-rivalrous. If I have an idea, you can have the idea as well, and I don't lose the idea, right, and that then shapes the law. Foxes are rivalrous. If Pearson has the fox, Post doesn't. And that, that difference, that fundamental difference between the nature of the resources may affect what we think the law should be governing ownership of those. And so if you're really into that, take probably there's an intro to IP course here. Right and patent you can take the IP stuff. Good IP faculty here too. Columbia has great faculty and everything, so pretty much, you know, there's, there's probably something that it's not good at, but, uh, very few things. So, um, you can, uh, look at that. So, uh, the key idea here, we don't want to get some of you may not be familiar with intellectual property, don't want to get in the weeds in this key idea here is just that the nature of the resource may affect the nature of the rule that we think is appropriate for the ownership of the resource. Property is a law of things. Um, and the nature of the thing may change the nature of what we think the rules should be governing that. I've heard a bunch of arguments now, uh, you know, quite cogent arguments in favor of, uh, giving it to, um, uh, Pearson. Anybody wanna defend Post here? Yeah. So I feel like the way that we've been talking about this so far is as if Post and Pearson had started from the same point and chased the fox and Pearson had just been a more effective hunter and had just won, uh, on his own merits, um, and I think this bleeds a little bit into the Livingston descent, but I think one of the critical facts here is that Post had been chasing the fox. He'd worn it down. Pearson comes along. Um, he sees the fox and it's unclear whether he would have shot the fox and killed it had Post not been chasing it in the first place. And so I feel like by automatically giving the possessor these property rights, you could potentially disincentivize the person who puts in the effort and may not obtain that possession, but whose effort is a prerequisite for. The possession to begin with. All right, so one of the issues that arises here, so one thing about this fact pattern here is almost certainly Pearson would not have gotten that fox if Post hadn't been chasing it in such at that time in such a way that it actually ran near Pearson, right? Just like the theoretically possible, but like a chance in a billion that that would have happened. So what we've got here is a situation in which both people. Contributed to acquisition of the fox, right? Post by chasing it and wearing it out, Pearson by finally stepping in there and getting it. And we don't know that Post ever would have actually gotten it, right? It's possible that Fox might have gotten away if Pearson hadn't, uh, done what he had done. Um, now that's interesting because there is a striking feature of American law in general that I sometimes think is maybe not optimal, but there's probably good reasons for it. I need to do some work on this. That American law loves all or nothing solutions. Right, somebody's going to own the fox, somebody's going to not own the fox. It's very binary, 1 or 0, right? We don't have generally a system in which you go, well, you know what, we're going to share the ownership of the fox. Now it is possible to share ownership of property. We'll talk about that later in the course, various ways in which you can divide up property ownership in various ways. But here, like the court, neither the majority nor the dissent thinks, well, maybe we should have some sort of shared arrangement here. Um, one thing that you might, one way in which that can show up in the law, I don't know if it's taught at Columbia. Yeah, almost certainly remedies is taught at Columbia. Uh, uh, you may have a course in restitution, like a two-credit course, some law schools do, uh, and unjust enrichment. Um, if you could take a course in that, do so. It's very interesting and it's something you don't actually get exposed to nearly enough, but it really relates to a lot of the, uh, intuitions people have. So ordinary liability. Torts contracts, right? Um, somebody did something wrong. The person who's wronged then gets to be placed in the position he or she would have been in but for the wrong, right? So that's what you're doing. That's the aim of the tort system, the contract damages, and so forth, right. With unjust enrichment and restitution, the idea is the opposite. You focus on the defendant and you place the defendant in the position he or she would have been in but for the wrong. The plaintiff may have suffered no harm whatsoever, but you may force the defendant to disgorge his or her unwarranted gains, unjust enrichment, which is very interesting. Right, in an unjust enrichment regime where you're bringing, when you can, when you can bring claims for unjust enrichment, you may be able to get partial compensation, sort of like the amount of the enrichment that is unjust, sort of quantum meri it may. You may have some splitting going on, but that's not what's happening here, right? And so, um, you might have a theory that says, well, we're we're binary, right? It's got to be either Pearson or Post. Well, who contributed more to the demise of the Fox? You might think that Post, you know, both of them did something, but Post did more, so we should allocate it to Post. All right, that would be an argument for awarding it to Post. Now what's the problem with that argument? As a practical matter, yeah. It, it's gonna be very difficult to figure out who invested more or not. Uh, seeing who walked into court with a fox in their hand is very easy. This point was made before, yeah, establishing how much each person contributed to the catching the fox may be challenging. Alright, that's a, uh, um. That could be a serious difficulty with this. All right, there's one other like weird thing, court mentioned it, I mentioned it when summarizing what the court said here about uh what Pearson did, uh, that might be an argument for posts. Nobody's mentioned it, yeah. Um, well, it seems like, uh, Pearson, he didn't actually want the Fox, he just wanted Post to not have it. This is like some sort of weird internecine dispute between like the old money and new money and wherever this was, um, so, you know, you could ask like should the court be sanctioning this outcome given that it might exacerbate social tensions and given that. This isn't really related to the allocation of economic utility in any sense. Yeah, so putting it differently or just more pithily, Pearson's a jerk, right? I mean, Pearson is a jerk. Post here, you see his posts doing all his work, and Pearson steps in and takes the fox to keep Post from getting it. Is that fair? And I realize all you guys are going to corporate law where is it fair, is not like an issue that you're not, uh, it is that you're supposed to be doing and I guess you're all doing your interviews now and so you don't want to be talking in the interview. I don't know. I just want to do what's fair here. Oh thank you very much. We'll find somebody else. Um, the, uh, but it kind of matters, you know, for the. Legal system, is this really fair that you know, do we want to be rewarding this kind of behavior? Now ordinarily you might have administrability concerns like how do you really know what Pearson's motivation was, but here the court says somehow seems to know that Pearson did it in order to keep Post from taking it. Is that the kind of thing we want to give incentives for? Maybe not, right? So there's a, there's an issue, uh, there that's float floating around that it's worth, uh, keeping in mind, um. OK. One way to try to sort out. Who should win this case is by figuring out what purpose. Having property rights and foxes is supposed to serve. What are we trying to accomplish here? And then come to a conclusion based on what will best promote that purpose. And it turns out that the majority and the dissent in Pearson disagree about what the purpose of ownership of foxes should be or what the purpose of allocating ownership of foxes should be. They think the motivation for they have two very different visions for what the motivation for property ownership in foxes should be here. All right, um, so what did the majority emphasize? They say, what are the, you know, what, what did they think should be the goal? What was the principle, the broad general principle that was motivating them toward the ultimate, uh, specific rule that they have here? What do they care about? What were they worried about? Yeah Um, they seem to be worried about like physical possession of the fox, like the pelt or the meat or whatever. Yeah, so they were cared, they cared about that, but they cared about it for a reason, right? So they're, they're stating and saying, hey, we're trying to accomplish something here. It is like, why is this case important? We need to do this so that, and yeah. Um, they said that like foxes were like beasts of prey, so it's beneficial to a society to basically um hunt these foxes. So anyone who puts a fox to death by any means is benefiting society. All right, right track, wrong direction. You are 180 degrees off, but that's good because you're on the right track. You, you very nicely explained what the descent, so that was the descent's motivation. So very good. The descent. Livingston in his descent thinks that we need to be trying to get rid of foxes. Foxes are pests and need to be eradicated. Livingston's descent is, it is not clear to me that he actually. Isn't having fun here. Uh, there is, I, it, it reads kind of like a joke. There's a book by Angela Fernandez about this case that I have yet to read in which I believe she argues that he's basically joking. Um, the language sort of suggests that I have not read other Livingston opinions to know, but he may be just having, it's like this is a ridiculous case, right? Uh, um, and he may be having some fun here, but, so the, uh, what he says is Fox surpassed, quote, and to put him to death. Ever found is allowed to be meritorious and of public benefit. Um, you may be familiar with the saying, right, uh, fox, uh, have a fox guarding the chicken coop or let a fox into the henhouse, right? Not good because foxes kill your chickens. All right, so there's a policy reason, Livingston says to favor fox hunters here. Because foxes are pests, quote, our decision should have in view the greatest possible encouragement to the destruction of an animal so cunning and ruthless in his career, unquote. So we need to preserve incentives for fox eradication, right, by means of fox hunting. Note that this is purely instrumental. Right, this has nothing to do with fairness or anything, uh, who's a good person or who's a bad person. It's just we need dead foxes. We need a rule that will maximize dead foxes, and so it comes up with what? Yeah. I, I think a larger, uh, a larger point for the, the descent is not, it's not just about foxes, but in general I think that the scent thinks that in order to promote productive activity we want to promote people to be chasing whether it's foxes or chasing any sort of commerce and I think they're coming, as was mentioned before by Cole from this lock idea where if you invested into this then you deserve it more and, and. And we would just want to promote productivity and I think that the majority disagrees because they think to promote productivity overall we need a clear cut rule and that's what they're seeking and I think that that's the main thrust that's what they're seeking in their opinion is that we want something to be very, very clear and simple we shouldn't be arguing every single time a fox gets caught or for that matter any. Time there's a property dispute we don't want to be figuring out who invested more time. We just need a clear cut rule and that's why they stress the administrability. OK, so you have a couple of, uh, considering, so a couple of different subconsiderations under a broad consideration as a suggestion here. So the broad consideration is what we would say social efficiency, let's call it that, right? So, uh, optimal production of wealth in society, maximize that, and then you can have distributional questions about how to distribute it best later on. But we want to maximize production of wealth. How do you do that? And you may emphasize then two different things, both of which are important, but you may different people may privilege one over the other. So one thing is giving incentives to people to actually engage in productive labor, right, and maybe doing that by giving them rewards for putting in the labor. Another thing though is trying to have certainty with respect to who has what rights. Why does the certainty matter for investment? Yeah, go ahead. Is it for judicial economy just because if mere pursuit could confer property rights then this would just always lead to litigation? Well, so one thing is it might you, uh, the extent that you're gonna have to go to court to vindicate your rights routinely, that's very expensive, right? You guys are gonna be charging a lot of money per hour once you graduate from here, right? Uh, lawyers are expensive and. And the time you spent in litigation is expensive, right, but there is also a cost that's imposed by uncertainty, independent of whether you have to go into court or not, which is that it makes planning and investment difficult, right? How do you know where to put your money if you don't know what's going to happen? If you're confident the market's going to go up, put it in the stock market. If you're confident the market's going to go down, get out of the stock market. But if you don't know, then it's hard. Right, um, if you're going to invest in building a hotel in some place, you need to know what the rules are going to be governing. The zoning for the hotel, what rates you could charge for the rooms of the hotel, uh, so you can figure out whether it makes sense to do it or not. And the more uncertainty there is, the riskier it is to engage in that and the less likely you are to do it, which means that resources don't get used just because people are like, I, I don't know, I don't want to take the risk. OK. So the majority, so the dissent is focusing on incentives for just like putting in the labor. And so one final quote from Livingston here, colorful, right? Livingston's colorful language emphasizing the, hey, we want to give incentive to people to invest energy. Who would go to the trouble and expense of fox hunting, Livingston says, quote, If just as the night came on and his stratagems and strength were nearly exhausted, a saucy intruder who had not shared in the honors or labors of the chase were permitted to come in at the death and bear away in triumph the object of pursuit. Um, unquote. All right, so the idea is, who's going to invest money in fox hunting or in other productive activity if somebody else can swoop into the last moment and, uh, and take the prize. All right, uh, the majority, Tompkins is focusing on certainty, right, um, says that, uh, the, uh, uh, Tompkins says that we need to be focusing on uh what will be good, quote, for the sake of certainty and of preserving peace and order in society. Giving property rights to people who had accomplished less than Pearson did, majority says would prove a fertile source of quarrels and litigation. So it's beneficial to society just to have people know who owns what, and then you can adapt and then you can adjust your decisions and make plans accordingly, and then you know and you don't fight over it. Nice. Um, if you're a football fan. Nobody knows today what actually constitutes a catch anymore, right? It's like, and so you got these, you know, you watch the game and they're like, did he catch it or not? And then you have the booth review and you got the, you know, the experts weighing in on whether somebody caught it or not. And you have all these disputes about these things, right? Um, as and then nobody's happy, right? So. Complains, oh no, that, you know, depending upon which team you're rooting for, it obviously was a catch or it obviously was not a catch, and the refs are obviously biased against your team and they never call holding against the other team, um, as opposed to something like, you know, the offsides rule, which is, you know, either you're offsides or not, and you don't have fights over that because it's very clear. Um, so things that are unclear just lead to disputes. Things that aren't, things that are clear don't, and that's good for society, the majority thinks. OK, again, note the majority is also doing the instrumental reasoning here. This is not about fairness. Who do we think is a good person? It's just about, well, you know, it's better to have clear rules, clear allocations of entitlements, so we're gonna do that. OK. Given. These two different visions of what property law has attempted to accomplish here. Unsurprisingly, the majority in dissent come to two different rules that they think should be applied in this case, rules for determining the ownership of wild animals. So Tompkins, the majority, and this is a little bit tricky aspect of the majority's opinion, is that they give sort of two statements, two different statements of what they think the rule is, and the best way I can sort that out of my head is that they are first, that they're sort of moving in a logical progression. They start by giving you a broad vision of what the law is trying to accomplish here. We want certainty, avoid reduce disputes. That then leads to some general principles that we're going to want to apply to determine ownership of wild animals. And then that's sort of an intermediate set of principles, and then they're going to give you very concrete rules for specifically what happens if you've got a hunter or differently if you've got a trapper. But they've got that intermediate statement. So what's the intermediate statement? The intermediate statement is this, that a pursuer is deemed to have possession. If he satisfies 3 conditions, got to satisfy all 3. One, quote, manifests an unequivocal intention of appropriating the animal to his individual use. One, manifests an unequivocal intention of appropriating the animal to his individual use. 2 has deprived him, the animal, of his natural liberty. Unquote has deprived the animal of its natural liberty. And 3 has brought him again the animal within a certain control, has brought the animal within the pursuer's certain control. Now note that the first of those three elements uses the word unequivocal. The third uses the word certain, unsurprising because the majority thinks that the important thing is for us to have certainty, and for it to be very clear. So we're going to require unequivocal intent and certain control, and if you don't have that, not good enough. Um, now, the court then says something interesting, and I'm slightly reordering what they I'm ordering the discussion here, not saying in the order in which they say various things, but in I think the logical order in which they're thinking things. They did say something interesting, uh, which is this, that the deprivation, this deprivation of the animal's natural liberty may justly be deemed to give possession of them to those persons who by their industry and labor have used such means of apprehending them, unquote. Now what's interesting about this to me is that that this seems completely unrelated to the certainty question, right? They are saying, oh, the rule that we're giving here actually is just, it may justly be deemed to give possession to people who worked really hard to get these animals. All right, so why are they doing that, given that they've just said that the whole name of the game here is to promote certainty and reduce disputes. Well, I think that there may be two motivations here, um. One is the thought that justice, for the rule to be just, it's not good enough that it merely promotes social efficiency. The thought that in order for it to be just, there may be other things that need to be taken into account. And so the court's saying, and don't worry about it, we take it into account and this rule does that, so we're good. Right. The other thing that may be going on here is that in general, intuitive plausibility of rules is important for people to comply with them. So why do people obey the law? Well, in part because the coercive power of the state is lurking in the background if you don't. But that is not why 99% of law-abidingness happens. 99% of law abidingness happens because people just sort of do it, right? If we had to have a system in which people always violated the law unless there was a cop watching to arrest them. It would just be chaos. There's no way you would have enough cops to do that, right? By and large, the way the system works is people just sort of follow the rules. The extent to which people voluntarily comply with rules depends upon the extent to which those rules seem more or less intuitively plausible. If the rule seems crazy, people don't do it. Used to be the case in New York City until like 2 years ago, I guess, that there was a rule that you could not jaywalk. It was illegal to jaywalk. Now it's, I think, illegal to jaywalk. It used to be illegal to jaywalk. Everyone in New York City except me jaywalked. I would stop and wait for the light to change. Freezing outside, just rain smashing in my face, frozen rain. I'm waiting there for for the light to change because I believe in the moral authority of laws, but I am very weird. I am the only guy in the city doing that. I once had somebody yell at me at an intersection because she was mad at me for waiting for the light to change. Uh, nobody else did it. Why? Because it seems crazy. There's nobody for two miles in either direction. What kind of idiot is waiting for the light to change? Well, me, but other than that, nobody else, right? You just look and you go, OK, it's safe, it's you cross, right? Um, that laws seemed intuitively implausible to people, some people just didn't comply with it. Um, so if you want to get voluntary compliance, you need to have rules that seem intuitively plausible. And one thing that seems intuitively important in property allocations, if somebody works really hard to get something, all else being equal, that seems relevant to whether the person should own the thing, right? And so the court here, I think is maybe alluding to that too, saying, you know, it's OK, we're, our rule doesn't like violate our intuitions too much. You know, it's kind of sensible. Um, and, uh, that's also important for preserving the legitimacy of the court in the eyes of people, right? If courts handled down decisions, it just seemed crazy. People didn't think the court is illegitimate. We see this with the Supreme Court where apparently in popular understanding it seems that uh constitutional law is very easy. Um, so you, you could just do this on your common law exam. Uh, it's like, do I like the outcome or not? If I do, constitutional. If I don't, court is illegitimate. There you are. Uh, that's, you know, that's the popular understanding as far as I can tell of constitutional law. And you know, there's something in that in the sense that, uh, the court issues orders and then are people gonna comply or not? How do you, how, how's the court enforce that? Well, big question. Talk to your common law people about that. OK, so. Tompkins has laid out, the majority has laid out the sort of general set of principles, right, uh, which is more specific than just saying, hey, we want certainty, but doesn't actually tell us really how to resolve ownership of the Fox case because it's like, well, they unequivocally demonstrated unequivocal intent and brought it within certain control. I mean, What does that mean? We, we got 2 people here. We got to pick the fox thing. So they then give a more specific formulation. Um, and that is this, uh, and they split it up, they bifurcate it. Different rules for hunters and for trappers because those are two different types of activities. So are you chasing the animal and then shooting it, or are you waiting for the animal to come to you and fall into the trap for hunters. Hunter is deemed to possess the wild animal if um. The hunter has both mortally wounded the animal and didn't abandon pursuit. So it requires mortal wounding and not having abandoned pursuit. For trappers, and this is a Yeah, scratch that sentence. That sentence never happened for trappers. I was about to say something, but I've changed my mind on it, so I don't I'm not going to say that. All right, for trappers, um, you must trap the animal by means of nets or other forms of interception, so as to deprive them, the animals, of their natural liberty and render escape impossible, unquote. So you have to deprive it of its natural liberty and render escape impossible. There's just no way they can get out. Um, OK, so now this is just world's most straightforward issue rule analysis conclusion question, but kind of thing you would do on an exam. So under the majority's test, why does Pearson win and Post lose? We are just applying the rule to the facts. Yeah, Yeah, no one else around you. It's like, this is, this is terrible. I need the seating chart. Um, it could just be that, like we said earlier, there's no guarantee that Post would have ever, um, got it, and Post is a hunter. Um, so even though they didn't, he didn't abandon pursuit, he didn't mortally wound the animals. So, um, Pearson also didn't abandon pursuit technically, and he mortally wounded the animals, so, uh he fulfilled exactly. So both elements have to be satisfied here. You have to have mortal wounding and not abandoning pursuit. Post didn't abandon pursuit, but he also, so that's good, but he didn't satisfy the mortal wounding bit. Pearson did mortally wound and then not abandoning pursuit was pretty easy, but he basically then picked up the animals, so he didn't just like walk away. OK, so I that's once you got the specific rule here, then it becomes easy to resolve the case and that's just sort of mechanical application of the rule and we're good to go. All right. Um, now, Livingston, we noted, has a different vision. Of what the law should be trying to accomplish here. Right, um, trying to preserve incentives for fox hunting activity, right, so offers a different test, a competing test for what it would need to be satisfied, right? Say that property and wild ownerships, uh, property and wild animals, excuse me, should be acquired without bodily touch or manu caption, menu manual, right, Latin root for that hand grabbing it by your hand. Captain is for the Latin verb for disease. All right, so without grabbing the sucker, right, um, if the pursuer one has shown that he intends to convert the animal to his own use. And the animal is either within reach of the pursuer, or the pursuer has a reasonable prospect of getting the animal. So you need to have shown the intent to get the animal, and the animal's either, you know, within reach, or the pursuer has a reasonable prospect of getting it. So note that this is much easier for the pursuer to satisfy than the majority test is. Majority test requires mortal wounding, right? You have to actually basically killed the fox. You don't have to have done that under Livingston's test. You just have to have a reasonable prospect of getting it. Much easier to satisfy. There's a trade-off. Life is full of trade-offs. Everything's about trade-offs. Um, there's a trade-off here. Um, it's easier for the pursuer to satisfy, preserving incentives for pursuers to chase foxes, but it's much less certain. Alright, so it says It's good enough if you have a reasonable prospect of getting the animal. Well, what the heck is that? Right? I mean, I, I don't know. It's like I, you know, so I mean, good news for the lawyers, right, to get to litigate left and right, what a reasonable prospect is, but seems pretty uncertain, and there's no way to know ex ante until you go into court, what actually, you know, was that good enough? I don't know, let's go find a judge and find out. OK, but that makes sense for Livingston because Livingston's not so concerned about certainty. And avoiding disputes, Livingston wants to make it, uh, preserve incentives for people to chase foxes. Um All right, how are we doing? Great. OK, there's one other famous bit about this case. And it's a famous bit about the descent. So Livingston has a suggestion about how it is we should figure out what the rule should be. This is, if you want to use some technical lingo, an institutional suggestion. What is the optimal institution for determining what the rule should be here? What does Livingston think is the right way to go about doing this? Yeah Um, he mentions the arbitration of sportsmen. Is that it? OK. Right, so he says that, um, uh, this case really shouldn't be in court in the first place. This instead optimally would be given to a tribunal of sportsmen who would be better at determining this. All right. Uh, Livingston says that ownership of the Fox, uh, in such cases, is a knotty point and should have been submitted to the arbitration of sportsmen without poring over Justinian, Flata, Brackton, Pufffendorf, Locke, Barbarak, or Blackstone, unquote. All right, there's a long list of names there, some of which are probably familiar to you. Others of which probably aren't. So Justinian, Roman emperor, not a lawyer, but had the code but ordered the creation of the Code of Justinian, which is sort of the foundation of Roman laws. It gets transmitted then to Europe and so civil law countries are all sort of harking back to that. Uh, who else is well known here? Puffendorf, maybe you might have heard of if you did some philosophy or intellectual history stuff. Um, did a bunch of stuff on international law, famous theorist Locke, who already has gotten, uh, gotten name checked in this class, so presumably you've heard of Locke. Uh, Blackstone, I hope you have heard of, right? Commentaries on English law, one of the most important works of Anglo-American. Uh, legal scholarship, um, it's super important for the development of American law. And then you got, you know, the people that nobody knows anymore. Flata was a treatise on English law from like the Middle Ages. Uh, Bracton had an earlier treatise that actually probably Flata, whoever Flata was actually cribbed probably from. Barbarak was a French jurist from the early 1700s. Like these people are not well known today. The idea is don't look to these people. Don't look to a bunch of this academic nonsense. Just, you know, it's a hunting thing. Talk to hunters, right? And that's much better to talk to hunters because hunters would not interfere with the usage or custom which the experience of ages has sanctioned and which must be so well known to every votary of Diana, unquote. OK, votary is a religious adherent. And Diana is. Whoever said it, say it louder or use a mic or something. She's the Roman goddess of like the hunt and animals. Excellent, right? And who's the Greek kind of art? Very good. All right. Uh, 3 internet points for you, right? So it's, uh, uh, redeemable for absolutely nothing. All right, so yes, it's very good. So, uh, every votia Diana is just a fancy long-winded way of saying a hunter, right? Um, so again, Livingston's language is a little, you know, I think he's having some fun here. All right, so the idea is that sometimes private ordering may be superior to having a legal system sort things out. What we should do is ask hunters what they would say, because one, the custom that they come up with. Is one that's probably pretty good. It is sanctioned by the ages. They like it's, it's, it's, it's time-tested. And two, it would be well known to everybody. Right, so everybody would know in the, in the, you know, hunting profession or hobby would know what the rules were. Easy to determine. Right. So he thinks that this should be done. Basically by looking at the people who are practicing in the Relevant field of endeavor. Uh, we will see that idea recur again pretty quickly when we talk about Gen v. Rich. Um, Are there any questions on this so far? All right, one final note, it was mentioned, it was alluded to in the discussion. Oh yeah, sorry, I didn't answer the question. See, I told you, right, sit down in front. I like, uh, completely outside the view, invisible.

SPEAKER 3
I mean it's good, but I guess my only question was, um, like under, uh, Livingston's test, I mean, couldn't several people have just as equal claims of ownership at the same time as, say, Min and I were both tracking the same fox within the same distance and we're just as much, you know, we're just as far apart from that fox at the same time. Um Presumably we would we both have ownership or how would you reconcile exactly identical claims under this framework? Yes, it's a good question, and that's a problem, right?

SPEAKER 0
Anytime you you're trading off certainty for something else, the lack of certainty, the reduction in certainty means that you may have multiple claimants who seem equally situated. Um, and even if not identically situated, close enough, right, that you go, I don't know, right? And so suppose you could have a hypothetical here in which you get post and you got most, and both the post and most are both chasing the fox, and they both see it at exactly the same time. And they both were equidistant from the fox and they're both chasing after it for exactly the same amount of time. And then Pearson steps in and seizes the fox, and now Post sues and most sues, and how do you decide who owns it? Um, so that may be a problem, might be a fatal problem, but. This might actually be a situation in which the law would grant joint ownership. We haven't talked about that yet, we'll talk about it later. It is possible to be co-owners of things. All right, and so it might be that they would allocate the Fox both to post and most. Yeah. I don't quite understand this consideration. I'm assuming that that in Dylan's hypothetical, it could even with the majority, you could still have this instance of two people having equal claims for they somehow managed to shoot the fox in the same exact second. However. Unlikely that is our initial hypothetical is also somewhat unlikely that they're exactly equidistant, right? Yeah, so maybe you can push it. so I got a doctorate in philosophy and we spend a lot of time. That's basically what you do. You just, you come up with some rule, somebody comes up with a rule, starts with a seminar, somebody comes up with a rule, and then you shoot it down, um, and you come up with a counter example and you just keep doing that. Uh, for enough years until you get a dissertation, right? That, that's basically it, uh, and so it's excellent training, uh, in the logic stuff, um, like it's, it's great. So any argument that comes in, I am still hardwired to just look at it, it flies, it dies, right? It's like, uh, you, you bring it in, it's like I'm going to try to knock it down, and sometimes you can, sometimes you can't, right? And if you can't, then it's like, OK, it's a pretty good argument. So you can come up with things here if you're really interested in that possibility. There's a famous work of legal philosophy. Uh, HLA Hart, I forget the name of the paper, um, which might be a chapter in a book, but he's got an example of, so there's a thing in philosophy referred to as overdetermination, right, where, um, What A causes B, we get that, right? But what if A and C both cause B and either of them would have been sufficient? So I believe my recollection has been a couple of decades, I think since I read Hart's paper, but I think the example that he gives is of somebody who ends up getting murdered, and the question is who the murderer is. And so the example is set in the old West. Somebody's about to go riding off across the desert to get from point A to point B and has a canteen of water. What you need so that you don't die of thirst along the way. And during the evening. One enemy poisons the water. The other enemy pokes a hole in the bottom of the canteen, so that the water slowly drips out. Guy then heads off into the desert and is never seen again, never arrives at the place. Which enemy murdered? The guy who went off in the desert, right, and it gets worse, right? Like, I don't know, right? It's like they both did it, but I don't know. And one way in which this gets really worse is because a standard test, you probably talked about the counterfactual test for causation and tort maybe, right? So standard test for did A cause B? Well, if A had not happened, would B have happened? Right, Standard test for this. Like, so if I smack this, that knocks over, knocks over the bottle, right? If I had not smacked that over at that exact moment, would the bottle have fallen over at that exact moment? No counterfactual test there. Had that thing not happened, would you not have done, right? So all sorts of things that Happen where like somebody, you know, has bad luck and steps right in a particular place at a certain time they get hit by a car. Had they not stuck and done that, they would not have been hit by the car, right? So there's a counterfactual test for that, right? Everyone clear on the counterfactual test, more or less. OK, great. The counterfactual test in overdetermination cases doesn't work well. Because, so did the poisoner murder the guy? Well, The poison poison or murdered the guy if putting the poison in caused the guy to die, right? You have to have caused the guy to die in order to murder him. But if he had not put the poison in there, he still would have died because of the hole. So did the guy who put the hole in the canteen murder the guy? Well, no, because if he hadn't put the coal in the canteen, the poison would have killed the guy. So it looks like neither of them did. All right, famous paper by HLA Hart. It's, I think it might be by Hart and Tony Honore, maybe Honore and Hart. Um, you can look it up. There's, I'm sure Columbia people like know this much better. Outer borough guy here, like not so familiar with, uh, this stuff. Uh, I'm sure they like got it memorized. They can like quote it to you, uh, at length, um, but there are all sorts of like interesting issues that arise in this context and how does the law deal with them? Often the way the law deals with them is by going, uh, you know what, we're not really gonna kill ourselves, knock ourselves out about this. At some point, yeah, weirdness happens and we'll sort of. Figure something out, um, uh, but most of the time the world, the rule works pretty well and that's gonna have to be good enough for us, not good enough for philosophers, good enough for lawyers, and this is a law school, so you know, philosophy is like one building over, so we're just going to do a law school stuff. So excellent question, excellent thought, but um. Uh, that's, I think, the way it basically plays out, and it is, I think, overall generally the case that the more uncertainty you have in a rule that the rule allows for, the more options there are, the more opportunities there are for these perplexing hypotheticals to arise. Doesn't mean that it's impossible when you cut down on the uncertainty, but I think it does decrease the probability of encountering them and the frequency. OK, um, one last note on this. So it was alluded to in the, um, uh, discussion here that, uh, in, in the notes as a reference to a famous paper by Bethany Berger, um, in which, uh, she does research on this and like it turns out this, this entire case is in some ways. is a $3 bill, right? Nobody actually cared about ownership of the fox. That just wasn't the thing, right? The setup for this is that Pearson is part of a family that is old money, fallen on hard times, so they are downwardly socially mobile. Pearson's family claimed special privileges to the beach by virtue of their social status. Post is new money. These nouveau riches coming in, tech bro, hedge fund guy coming in and paying no attention to these social customs that say that Pearson had special privileges there. So Post is just out there hunting on the beach. Who knows, maybe as a bit of an FU to Pearson, you know, it's like, hey, look at me, I can do whatever I want. Pearson, then, that's why Pearson is stepping in to try to snag the thing right in order to keep Post from getting it. And so what Pearson is hoping here is that a court will basically uphold Pearson's family's special status there, and Post is hoping that it won't happen. Right, um, when we talked about how do you allocate property, ownership of things, one possible rule, right, is to give priority to people with higher social status. This is a thing that has happened in the past, right? We had royalty at one point in some societies, right? And so the king can do things that other people can't. We also had in the other direction, right, illegitimacy, right? If you were an illegitimate, uh, deemed to be illegitimate as a child, that decreased your rights to things. Social status affected your entitlements. Nowadays, celebrity, maybe we give more privileges to people who are famous because, you know, they're celebrities. Um, in American history, we have had privileges, entitlements granted on the basis of race, right? We had segregation, we had all this stuff that was race-based, right? Other societies have had similar things and also caste-based. So that is a principle that you could use too. You could do it based on looks, beauty. Right, it does seem to be the case in my observation that people who are really, really beautiful live in a different world than people who are not. I am noticing this as somebody as an outsider there to this. It's like, yeah, wow, OK, that's certainly certainly an experience very far removed from mine, but like I've I've seen it happen. Now we may think that these are bad ways of doing this, right? That there's all sorts of reasons why this is a bad way of allocating that, but that's a separate question, right? It's a possible way of doing it. It has been done, and then you have the normative question is like, is it maybe bad? And that's a question that's raised here, like, should Pearson, by virtue of his family being the Pearsons, have special rights to the beach? You know, many of us, I think, would say no, but uh that's a question, right? How should that be, how should that be determined? All right, um This is not idiosyncratic. This kind of concern is not idiosyncratic to this case. Property itself is an institution that implicates many general human concerns wealth, status, power, freedom. And it is the vehicle for specific disputes that are based quite often on personal feelings in ways that are not common in, say, contracts or torts or criminal law, because property disputes often are disputes between neighbors. People who live next to each other or near each other. Tort law is the law of strangers. I drive negligently. I hit you. I cause you an injury. You get to sue me. I may well have never met you before and will never meet you again, right? Contract law, typically a lot of strangers as well. You may have repeat contracts with people, but Large, it's often strangers. Criminal law very similar property law, law of neighbors, and folks come to have personal relationships or personal animosities, and those can affect both the vision of where we stand now based on the past interactions and based on the expectation of future interactions because you're stuck next to your neighbors. Um, so that is a particular, like a dimension of property law that we'll see running throughout the course here, um, uh, that makes it distinct from the other stuff that you've studied so far. OK, any questions on this before we take a break? All right, great. Let's take a break. We'll come back in 10 minutes and we'll talk about a whale.

more. I think we should go to the bathroom. Hi, hi Charles, nice to meet you. I can always like dude, I'm like I'm that desperate that I will drink this trash. That was me this morning and I was like, I'm so, I'm not doing well right now. We have our moot court competition going on and it's been happening the entirety of this week, so.

SPEAKER 0
I get that's a majority giving it sort of seems to me the majority's opinion works at three levels, right? Broader generality getting more specific at the top it says we need to preserve, promote certainty and preserve peace. All right then. You need to get to and then that's the bit that you talk there. Well, how do you then apply that in the context of wild animals, and that's the bit that you talked about there. Well, OK, we're going to give ownership to people who have manifested an unequivocal attempt to get the animal and the other two things, right? OK. But then that that's still kind of vague there. And so they get then more specific and say, if we're dealing with hunters chasing wild animals, we got a specific rule which should instantiate that more general uh approach. And then if you have trappers, you have a slightly different, um, uh, formulation. But that's the vision that I have of how this thing's actually working.

SPEAKER 1
You're welcome. That's it's. I don't know. Yeah I. I think. you know you know. I don't know. But he's got a They like Yeah. OK. I said. That's right. Oh Uh. Oh I. Yeah. that. Yeah Sorry, I forgot to send you. I you. Oh my God. I get it. nuts like we also. Yeah. I. Oh. OK. No. I As far as I. OK. Oh. I don't know. I don't find it. I. about. Aristotle, I know. Uh, I it's kind of pain, um, so I think in general. I certainly. Caucasians care about. Yeah. And some more pragmatic Don't you want to sign the. Why It It. As a road map Um. That Oh, wait, oh So Oh wait. I I No one. buddy. Yeah. He's like I, I need to discuss my makeup. I just don't believe it, right, and so. Like. you know. You know Oh. I am to you guys like all of this slide. I, I, I mean. I I I've actually I. Yeah, I was just like. that's fine. I mean. I. I I I. The That's pretty impressive. Bye. That's that's what all I'm doing to say. I take, take this. At that, and hopefully at that. But also like. I don't really know what the like purpose of it is, but That session is fun. I know. I was like I love The Simpsons. Alright, so just want to run that by you, that sounds good. But it must be like. that.

SPEAKER 0
OK folks, let's get back into this here. I do the lights. I would do it like opera style right there where you're theater style where you dim the lights and then turn them back on, but I can barely control the microphone, so I don't want to go messing with plunge you all in the darkness. OK, so our next case is rich. Another 19th century case now in a federal court, District of Massachusetts, 1881, page 255. We have boats, whaling boats, whaling ships that are pursuing finback whales and they're killing them. And to do that, they use bomb lances which are marked with distinctive marks corresponding to each whaling company. The use of a bomb lance makes this whole thing seem like a film directed by Michael Bay as far as I can tell. Um, now they do that because that's the only way to kill the finback whales because the finbacks are fast. So ordinary harpoon line techniques aren't going to work. The whales are too fast to be caught. All right, so what happens is you hit it with a bomb lance. The bomb lance goes boom, whale dies, and it sinks because it's just been kind of blown up, but it's not entirely blown up. Alright. And then it sinks and then bacteria does its thing, right? It then, uh, you know, it's continuing to live its bacterial life and it's emitting gasses. It causes the body to bloat up and then float to the surface. Yes, that happens when you die. Something to look forward to, but you'll be dead, so you're not going to have to worry about it. Um, all right, so then it floats to the surface and then eventually many of these then sort of get washed ashore. Alright, um, some get retrieved at sea, but many wash ashore, right, um, when that happens. People then walking along the beach eventually encounter, hey, here's a blown up whale, and when they do that, they usually send word to Provincetown that the whale has been found there on the beach. The company then pays the finder, whoever it was who did that, a small finder's fee. The court says it is small but reasonable unquote salvageable for that. Now that's ordinarily what happened, but that's not what happened in this case. Here, Ellis is walking along the beach, sees the whale, and goes, hey, free whale. Right, um, so doesn't modify, doesn't notify the company, but instead takes the whale and then auctions it off to, uh, Rich. The whaling company owner, uh, as far as I can tell, then sues for the value of the oil. I said, why do you bother killing whales because whales are fat. They have fat. They have the blubber. The blubber you use to turn into oil. The oil you then use for lamps so that you can see things after the sun goes down. Which is super useful. It's very valuable, so they sue for the value of the oil. They don't care about the whale. They just want the value of the oil. All right. Gen claims ownership of the whale under invoking a legal authority. What is the legal authority that Gen invokes here? You're looking around as if somebody's like you're waiting for somebody else to answer because you don't want to be the gunner who's answering when nobody else is going to answer. That means I think you know the answer. This time it All right, fake it. Like, I don't care. Like, I, I don't cold call, so if you want to like pass, you can pass, but you can also just like try to fake it or pass. Yeah. What they invoke during in court, they say I should win. You can't just go into court and say, hey, judge, I should win. They just, yeah, I like the cut of your jib. OK, you get it. It's like, no, you gotta, you gotta do something. I mean, from this case, it kind of sounded like, uh, it was like the fast fish, loose fish rule, like just the idea that Custom kind of said that, uh, for the fisherman or the whaler to use the harpoon, the harpoon was labeled properly, so they should have known that, uh, just given the custom in the area that when the whale would raise back to the surface, you can identify whose it is, but I guess I'm not understanding. Like they refer to different types of cases right about a minute ago, like in there, and it's like you're right, you just said the magic word. OK. All right, so congratulations. Yeah, you get the prize. Uh, the magic word is custom. Right they're invoking a custom. So what's the legal authority? They are not invoking, invoking Flatow or Bracton or Justinian or Puffendorf or Barbarak or Blackstone. They say custom. They, uh, in the words of the court under this usage, the usage being a custom. All right, so, um, Ken says, hey, there's a custom. Usage that entitles us to the whale. Alright, the long-standing custom on Cape Cod is that whoever kills the whale in this manner owns it. The respondent says the quote, and the words the court, insists that this usage is invalid, unquote. You could see the argument here, right? Gen comes in and says, hey, this is the custom and the. Uh, a defendant says custom, it's a court of law. What are you talking about? Like custom doesn't govern. Should be the law. All right, so now you have a fight over who owns the whale or is entitled to money monetary value of that, and the court then goes through various previous cases which I'm not gonna go into. I'm not gonna talk about at this point because this is not a case on whale law, a court, a case on course, course on whale law, right? Uh, we just like we don't care, uh, so, um, uh, I will touch upon them in a bit though, uh, later, uh. Because there's some interesting things that come out of this, uh, but so it looks at that and basically concludes, you know, that doesn't really resolve the case for us. So in this case, the court says the usage should prevail. Now, having said that, it does something interesting. It says, quote, it is by no means clear that without regard to the usage, the common law would not reach the same result, unquote. Um, now this is a thing that's actually quite common that courts will do if, say, a somewhat different context in which we'll see this happen is that the court is going to change the law. The law used to be one way. The court thinks that's bad, and so it's going to change the law, declare that there's a new rule under the common law. In doing that, courts are necessarily nervous because it seems kind of unfair to the party that parties that may have been relying on the old rule that suddenly, oh, we got a new rule coming in, right? They relied on the old one. So when courts do that, they typically, you'll see this often, I don't know typically I haven't done an empirical. You will often see a court try to say, say we are enunciating a new rule. But even if we had applied the old rule, the same result would have happened, right? So it's not unfair to the party that's going to lose here because they would have lost under the old rule anyway. We actually don't think that's the optimal rule, so we're going to give you a better rule. Both things, same result. This is, I think, the court doing something similar here, saying, you know what, customs are going to prevail here, but it's by no means clear that if we applied the common law, you know, it wouldn't have been the same result anyway, so it's not unfair. Nobody's expectations, justified expectations are being thwarted. Everything's fine. But having said that, it then says, quote, quote, but be that as it may, I hold the usage to be valid, unquote. So even if the common law would have said something else, the court says screw that, the usage is going to prevail. Um, so the whaling company wins. The court's reasoning invoked several criteria reflecting various general considerations relevant to deciding how to determine what the law should be. So one thing the court thinks is in favor of custom here, this particular custom, is that the usage is quote as reasonable as that sustained in the cases cited unquote. So these earlier whaling cases had various customs in the whaling industry for various types of whales, and they had, you know, some. Arguments in favor of them seem kind of reasonable and the court thinks that this one is as reasonable as those were. They govern different whaling situations, but similar level of reasonableness, so that seems consistent with the past there. That's good, courts like to be consistent. Second consideration, this custom has necessarily limited application, affecting few. All right, the stakes aren't super high on this here. There's only a few folks who like the only people who are going to be affected by this are whaling companies and not just not even every whaling company. It's just the ones that are hunting finbacks. So you know it's not that big a deal if we say that the custom prevails here. Third, there's been long acquiescence in this usage. The rule works well in practice. And people may have come to expect that this rule will apply because that's what's been going on for a long time. You just come to expect that. Suppose that New York City a couple of years ago back when jaywalking was still legal, suppose that New York City suddenly decided to enforce the jaywalking rules everywhere. What would be the result? Oh my gosh, that would be, you know, kind of chaotic and like a people, a bunch of people have been relying on those way things being one way and now, oh my gosh, they're a different way. That's not so good. Another consideration, this usage, this custom is necessary if this industry is to continue. Quoting the court, Unless it be sustained, this branch of industry must necessarily cease, for no person would engage in it if the fruits of his labor could be appropriated by any chance finder. So this is the incentive concern once again. We want to give incentives to people to go out there and hunt these whales because we want the blubber because we want the oil. One thing to know about the whaling industry is if it were the 19th century, um, that was a great industry to get into if you didn't want to worry about retirement because you weren't going to live long enough to retire. It was a very tough industry with a very high mortality rate. In it, um, who's going to actually engage in that if after you've gone to all the trouble and the risk of getting of killing the whale, then, you know, some jackass on the beach just comes and walks off with your blubber, right? Nobody, right? This is the incentive concern, very similar to what Livingston. I was worried about here, right, um, and then finally, final consideration they say in favor of this, uh, custom is that it gives reasonable salvage, right? It gives a reward to the effort and expense of the person who goes to the trouble of notifying Provincetown about the whale went to there. So you know it it it basically seems fair. And it also provides proper incentives to finders to actually provide the notice because they know, hey yeah, I can make a few bucks if I do it. So the whole, so the court ultimately concludes this seems to make good sense. All right, didn't people come to rely on it? So, OK, custom will be what will set the law here. We're not going to worry about the even if it diverges from what the common law would do. We're not going to worry about that. Custom is going to prevail. Now note that in some ways. In some sense, the result in this case is the opposite of what happened in Pearson against Post. Right in Pearson, we've got somebody chasing after the fox, putting a lot of effort, and then somebody comes in at the last moment and actually walks off with the fox, and that person wins. The person who grabs the fox actually wins. Here we got somebody chasing a whale, putting in a lot of effort, and then somebody else comes and walks off with the blubber, and that person who walks off with the blubber loses. The person who was chasing the wins. The latecomer who actually secures the whale doesn't get the whale. The latecomer who actually secured the fox does get the fox. All right, what's up with that? Well, 11 standard story you could tell just like immediate go to, right? Here's your law school go to. Well, this is decades later in a different jurisdiction, OK, different court, right? Uh, you're never wrong if you go with that one, right? But I think there's more that can be said here, right? It doesn't mean that this result was necessarily inconsistent with Pearson. The majority tests and Pearson asked if there was mortal wounding by someone who had not broken off pursuit. Clearly here, the whaling company had mortally wounded. The whale, right, it killed the whale. So the question then, if we were applying the Pearson rule to this, is, did the whaling company break off pursuit? Well, that then raises the question, how do we determine what constitutes breaking off pursuit? That's not clear on its face, right? And one possible answer as to how we figure that out is based on, well, what's the custom in the industry. What's ordinary, what's ordinarily thought of as breaking off pursuit and what's ordinarily thought of as continuing pursuit? Maybe that's what we have to look at. So even applying a common law rule may require custom to be a gap filler. Fill in what it is that's actually, uh, fill in the details you need in order to actually come to a result here. OK, so that's getting me rich. As a doctrinal matter, fairly straightforward. Any questions on this? All right, so then let's talk about the interesting question. We've seen the court give some arguments, some reasons in favor of deferring to custom. In this case, What might be some potential problems with allowing custom to take precedence over, say, the common law. All right. Privilege and custom, why might that be bad in some cases?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. Um, in, in the example here, things that are customs and well known in the whaling community might not be well known across the community. All right, so, all right, so one issue that can

SPEAKER 0
arise is whether, um, How easy it's going to be to figure out what the what the custom is, right? And so one thing about the law is it's relatively universal. Customs can vary from place to place, and that may really increase your information costs as you go from one place to another in figuring out what the actual governing rule is, and that can be problematic. That can produce some uncertainty here. This may have been something that was alluded to by the court in Swifty Gifford, which was one of the whaling cases that was mentioned in in G, where that court said the following. Although local usages of a particular port ought not to be allowed to set aside the general maritime law. This objection did not apply to a custom which embraced an entire business and it occurred in for a long time by everyone engaged in the trade. So that the Swift v. Gifford Court there might like the idea is, look, just having local customs that vary from port to port, no, we're not going to give priority to that because general maritime law should take precedence over that because it's going to be hard to know when you move from port to port. What's actually going to govern? I mean, when you kill the whale, when you kill the whale and again be rich. You don't really know where it's going to wash ashore. Now you may have tidal charts and things showing ocean charts showing where various currents are and things like that. So you might be able to predict, but you know there's a certain amount of randomness there, and if it varies from port to port, what the rules are going to be, that's going to be bad if you're a whaler because you don't know you know what your rights are going to be or whether you're going to have any rights there. So that could be a concern with customs. It may vary in ways that make it difficult to know what the custom is. Now that said, uh, yeah, you wanna say something, yeah, weigh in and then I'll say what I was gonna say. I'm, I'm just thinking that the, the price to pay a lawyer to find out what the law is, is presumably higher than than paying somebody who's at the port who could tell you what the custom is. It's a good point. Glad I called you because I anticipates the point I was gonna make. So excellent, um, so you can ask a further question though. How easy is it to know what the law is, right? Um, most people don't know what the law is. You gotta pay a lawyer to tell you what the law is. This is the 19th century. There's no Google, right? There certainly is no chat GPT. You can't do that. Uh, there's no Nolo Press. How many people here are familiar with Nolo Press books? Ah yes, this is created by some lawyers. These are books for, uh, on the law for non-lawyers on all sorts of things. Quite useful actually, um, uh, um. But you can't, you don't have that sort of stuff, so you got to have to pay a lawyer for that. For custom, it might be considerably easier just to, you know, if you're in the whaling business, go to the whaling bar, you know, the bar where all the whalers hang out and you see the guys with the peg legs and whatever, and you ask them what are the rules on stuff, and they'll tell you. So that might actually be much easier, but maybe harder. I don't know. If you're an outsider, they might not want to tell you. Right, that, that is a thing, right? to avoid competition. Um, all right, so what are some other potential problems with custom? Yeah, in the back. Um, I think I'm just concerned about whose interests the customs protect. I feel like a lot of times customs reflect like majority interests and then who's gonna protect the interests of like minorities and people who maybe are less wealthy. Yeah, so you could have a concern about majority making preferences, making customs for its own benefit. You can also have a concern related but distinct of minorities that are dominant, making customs that, uh, basically privilege itself. Um, at the, uh, to the detriment of in fact the majority, but because of the way society is structured, the majority, the minority has more influence over that. All right, so we had that in American history, right? We had Jim Crow laws. Jim Crow laws, I'm not a historian, but my understanding of this is that the Jim Crow laws were preceded by Jim Crow customs, right? So there were white supremacist segregationist customs that existed and then started being eroded. People stopped complying with them and so the folks who benefited from them then tried to lock them in by a law to stop the custom from evolving, but prior to that happening, you had the customs that were basically prohibiting the majority of the population. Often from doing things that we would today say they have every sort of moral right to do and should have a legal right to do, but the people who benefited from getting exclusive rights to themselves didn't want that, right, so they made a custom that was socially bad. So there's a question about our customs socially optimal, and one concern about that is what is the mechanism that produces the custom. If you've got a custom that's produced by just, you know, a bunch of people who are basically equals and they have, you know, just a bunch of experience doing things and everybody basically agrees, yeah, you know, this, this turns out this just works out as the best way of doing stuff, yeah, it seems OK. But if that's not what's going on for the creation of the custom, you could have really bad results that come from the from deferring to custom. Um, anything else? Any other concerns that might arise? Yeah, I guess sort of connected to what you were

SPEAKER 3
just talking about, just generally the, the customs might be, you know, negative, I guess, but the idea also connecting, I guess some to the Livingston descent that institutionalizing the custom might have a different effect, you know, from the customers at large, which is that it might inhibit the development or, you know, progression of that custom. And so whereas if the industry was just left to its own devices, like maybe, um, you know, suggested by. Livingston, then they could, you know, workshop that custom as needed and and improve it, whereas if the law says we're going to follow that custom, it then sort of maybe halts it in a point of development and that doesn't, can't change from that point. Yeah, so you could worry about freezing customs in place,

SPEAKER 0
right, if part of the justification for customs that works well in practice, if you freeze it in place by establishing a law basically make it govern. Then you may worry that as circumstances change, the custom should evolve, but now it's locked in by means of the law. Now one. I think a counterargument to that is just a court is going to need to make a decision based on something, right? And so if it's not going to defer to custom, then it's going to be imposing something else that probably is as frozen in place. But then the reply to that, and the counter reply would be that's raising the question, and this gets to Livingston's dissent as to not just what the source of the law should be, but who should be making the decision. So Livingston, remember, refers to a tribunal of sportsmen. So you don't go into court. Just have a tribunal of people who do this stuff, right? And they may be much more responsive to evolution in the governing custom than the court is. So that's an institutional choice question. You have probably encountered this in your law school career. You will encounter it in the future. The question is what institution is best situated to set the rules or to adjudicate things? All right. There's a classic question that you have like you probably do. When do you do law here? All right, so you know, should something be handled by an administrative agency? Should it be handled by legislation? Should it be handled by the executive outside of the administrative like political appointees rather than experienced administrators? Should it be handled by the courts? What's the best, what institution is best situated to come up with optimal rules there? And maybe the answer is none of. Then maybe you should do ADR, alternative dispute resolution, and defer to what the parties have done through some arbitration thing that they have put into a contract, entirely different way of doing this. All right, so there's institutional choice is a big question in the law who should handle this? And with custom, one question is what the content should be and what effect that should have, but another question is who's best at figuring out what the customs are. Our judges, or do we need some other tribunal to do it? All right, any other concerns about customs? Yeah.

SPEAKER 6
I mean, I could see how there'd be counterarguments to this, but custom is also perhaps more flexible than law which might, you know, be able to withstand multiple generations of, of, uh, time whereas custom might change from generation to generation, we might want something more stable.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, so, you know, one advantage to custom might be it's adaptability. One disadvantage to custom might be its adaptability, it's mutability, if you want to use a different term for it, right? It changes and as it changes over time, even if the changes might be beneficial in the abstract, the fact that people have come to rely on things one way rather than another maybe change may be costly. What's worse is what happens if the custom is in transition. How do you know when the custom is changed to something else and when the old custom governs may not be obvious, but the law, you know, a court hands down a decision or it doesn't, right? You know, or the legislature passed a statute or it doesn't, or an administrative agency. Hands down a rule or it doesn't, you can look that up, but with the custom, like when you're in a transition period, it can be hard to know and that can then cause problems because you just then just you're just uncertain, right? We're then again in a world of uncertainty about what governs. Um, and one, I'll just mention one other potential problem related, uh, here is if we're going to allow customs sometimes to trump the law, how do you know when that is? Like how do you know when you should be following the law and when you should be following the custom? Custom doesn't always trump the law, but if it sometimes trumps the law, how do you know what to do? That may have been actually what this case was about, right? This case appears to have been brought principally in order just to have the court sort out what in fact the rule was here. Quoting the court, as the question is new and important and the suit is contested on both sides more for the purpose of having it settled than for the amount involved, I shall give no costs, unquote. By saying I shall give no costs, the courts saying not going to award. So you know the American system is basically each side pays its own costs, right? You pay your own lawyers and if you're bringing the suit, you pay for the various fees that are associated with bringing the court case. Sometimes courts will award costs by which they mean they will require the defendant to pay the plaintiff's fees for filing, not the attorney's fees, but just the fees for filing. And here the court says, no, we're not going to do that. We're not going to do that because they think it's just not fair. It's it's uncertain and this case was really being brought. Just because they wanted somebody to tell them, the court to say what the answer was to this. The damages award was for $71.05. Now that's old money, right? You've got to adjust that for inflation. You do that in today's money, it's about $22,500 2500 dollars. Probably not worth the cost of litigating, right? A long case like this. Um, for, you know, you folks are going to be billed out. Well, when you're junior associates they always discount the rate at which you're billed out, but you know, I think probably in New York City at a big law, what's, what's the going bill hour rate? Somebody's got to know. Somebody's got to be related to a lawyer. I'm guessing how much? I don't know. I'm guessing it's got to be probably going to be at least 625 an hour, at least. I'm guessing. Might be wrong. When you, when you're doing your interviews, ask. Bad idea, bad idea. Although maybe, oh, focused on the billable hours, excellent. More? Yeah, OK, so more, so maybe 750, I don't know. What's, yeah, more really, is it up to 1000 now? Really it's up to 1000. OK, now the junior associates, the, uh, the, uh, managing partner will discount everything you do because nobody wants to pay 1000 bucks an hour for somebody who doesn't know the law. But, um, uh, but I mean that that that that's the reality, right, as you get more experience and they uh they cut down the discount. But all right, you know, today if it's 1000 bucks an hour, this is not a 2.5 hour process of doing this here, right? So this case is brought just because people are trying to figure out what the heck is going on. Right, and you will see that, you will see that happen, um. And so this is again one of the problems with custom. You don't know necessarily. What the rule should be, and that can cause problems. All right, I've got one minute left and I got one minute worth of stuff to say, so this is perfect. Um, so one final thing to just note here, which is what we didn't talk about in talking about this case. It is useful to note sometimes what things are not being said, what issues are not being raised, what questions people are not asking. So it is entirely possible. I am not. Not a scientist, don't know. But from my lay perspective, it seems entirely possible that whales are sentient creatures who are as intelligent as you and I, maybe more so. They just did not evolve opposable thumbs, right, so they don't make tools. So when you, when we're, we're talking about here a case in which it may well be that this is a case about murdering somebody and then stripping the carcass of its blubber so that we can make money off of it. All right now. Suppose that's the case. Does that change anything about the analysis of custom or the legal doctrine here? Probably not, right? You know, everything that's been said here probably doesn't change when you say that. Nevertheless, this case may be absolutely horrifying. The facts of this case may be absolutely horrifying. And it's worth keeping in mind when you read cases, right, what actually is the story going on in the case and what things we're not talking about when we talk about the case, right? Again, as a matter of issue rule analysis conclusion may have no effect but may have an effect on what we think. Or what we should think about what's happening in the case. All right, so maybe it's a case about, you know, people fighting over a murder, right, and which murderer should, uh, should win and maybe that should give us some pause. All right, that's it. You weren't going to get out of the class without a sermon. You knew that. All right, so there's a sermon for the day. All right, any questions on any of this? All right, great. I have office hours scheduled for right after this class. I think my procedure will be to sort of hang out here if people want to talk after class. At some point I may migrate up to my office in 7:09.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. Yeah. Some people don't. I think divergence is different because we got we got somebody's chasing and somebody swoops in the. Yeah, I feel like she's I like Benberg. It was actually something.
