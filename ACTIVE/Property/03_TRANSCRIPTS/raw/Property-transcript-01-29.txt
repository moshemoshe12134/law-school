No. I. I All right, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome back. Uh, audio check here. Am I audible enough? Not at all. Microphone is on. All right, well, if people stop talking, am I now am I audible enough? I mean, if not, I don't really, oh, I guess there's a magic switch over there that I can like boost it up there and get a power up on this thing, and get an audio power up. Lasts for 30 seconds, so I have to talk fast and, um, all right, um, last class, we began by discussing a problem that arises when we have a first possession regime, um, as a way of allocating property rights. Um. And that is the tragedy of the commons. One can get overutilization of a resource if they are simply left in common for the first person who gets the thing to use, um, because there's no benefit to forbearance and there's no benefit to investment. In those circumstances, cattle owners, the classic example of the tragedy of the commons is a giant field around which there's a bunch of ranchers who feed feed their cattle on the grass. Cattle owners cannot internalize the benefits of forbearance, nor can they internalize the benefits of investment. Um, so we have depletion of resources, uh, that results. Eventually all the grass gets eaten, nobody plants any grass, and then the resource has been destroyed. So the question then becomes how to avoid that tragedy. Standard account is that the institution of property solves the problem. It causes people to internalize both the costs and the benefits of their choices. For example, the choice about how much to graze cattle or whether to plant or not to plant grass. They suffer the costs and enjoy the benefits of their choices, leading to more efficient decisions, decisions that maximize the total amount of wealth in society. But Eleanor Ostrom points out that property, private property, is not the only way of solving the problem, um, may not always be the best possible solution. It comes with costs. There are costs of monitoring, there are costs of enforcement, and there are costs of risk mitigation. Um, it is essential to consider both the benefits and the costs of any choice that you make. And I will add that it's important to consider them relative to the other available institutional choices that you can make. Everything in life has upsides and downsides. There is pretty much nothing, I think, that doesn't come with a downside. There may be something that's all downside. There probably are things that are all downside. There is nothing that is all upside. If nothing else, there are opportunity costs, right? Going to Columbia Law School is probably a smart choice for you, but the 3 years you spend here are 3 years you're not doing something else, right? And so you have to make a decision based on the costs and the benefits, um, relative to what else you could be doing. Um, Ostrom then discussed other possible solutions too. We could just have state control, central planning, right? Uh, some central authority tells people what to do, and how much to do it, and when to do it, and so forth. Um, and that has advantages but also significant disadvantages as well. Um, or there may be complicated hybrid regimes, um, private ordering, which we saw in, uh, Ocean discusses in Turkey, Alanya, Turkey, so a complicated arrangement there just set up by the people who are involved in the practice. And again, advantages and disadvantages. We also noted another problem that Ostrom doesn't discuss with having private property, and that's a potential problem with the anti-commons, where you have too many people with property rights, property entitlements to some resource that can make it impossible or very difficult to get optimal use of that resource because it's very difficult to get everyone to agree about what's the best thing to do. Um, One thing that I didn't mention last class, but I should mention briefly now. Is that although the institution of private property is often justified today, um, on the grounds that it solves the tragedy of the commons and related problems, there are other justifications for private property, uh, including justifications that you may personally find more persuasive. So one important one that floats out there is the idea that private property is essential for preserving autonomy. Um, this is not an economic account in any way. It's just that people have more flourishing lives if they have things that they can call their own. Um, old-fashioned saying, a man's home is his castle. You might say today a person's home is his or her castle, but the basic idea is that what happens in your home is governed by you and you alone. You can do what you like in your home. You can be with you, be with whom you want in your home. You can live the life you want. You can worship as you wish or not at all, right? Um, you can make all sorts of choices about your life on your property, and other people cannot interfere with them. They're not allowed to come into it. Come onto the property. You can exclude them. This gives you a sphere in which you can govern your own life as you see best, right. That protects your autonomy in ways that you cannot perhaps have if that doesn't exist, right, if everything is contingent upon being getting the approval of somebody else. If you're a historian of political thought, you may also be familiar with Thomas Jefferson's vision of dispersed private property ownership as being essential for democracy. Is there an argument that the health of a democracy depends ultimately on widespread property ownership. So that's another. Third type of justification for this. So there are many different justifications that exist out there for the institution of private property, and of course each of them also would be subject to criticism as well. No free launches. I do want to highlight for you that these other things exist as well. All right, then we turn to the question of water rights, ownership of water rights. We surveyed 3 different ways of allocating water rights, which corresponded, I suggested to you, to 3 different general principles about how to allocate property rights to resources in general. Um, one, the natural flow approach. You're allowed to remove only as much water as will not disrupt the natural flow. A just allocation of property is one that gives everybody the same. An advantage? Well, it gives everybody the same equality. We're all supposed to like equality. That sounds good. Disadvantage, it significantly impedes productive use of the water because you can't use much water at all unless you get everybody else who would be affected by it to agree. And we already noted that getting a lot of people to agree can be a real problem. So some technical lingo that we threw out for this is you have assembly problems and you have holdout problems that can arise here. So one way of perhaps avoiding those problems is to say we're going to use a different rule, the reasonable use rule. This is Evans versus Merriweather. A just allocation of property rights or water in that, in particular in that case, uh, seems to be one that promotes allocation of resources to socially valuable uses by allowing reasonable use where reasonableness is determined in terms of social value, the value of the use, and How valuable, how socially valuable use is, is ultimately determined by the government. Court in this case. Now an advantage of this is it seems to allow more beneficial use of water than the natural flow approach does. Also, it's got the magic word reasonable in it. How can you be opposed to something that says we'll use reasonable use? The only people who could be are people who want things to be unreasonable, right? It says reasonable right in there, so there's no possible objection. Of course there are possible objections, right? It has a downside, which is who the heck decides what reasonable is? How would that person know? How do you know ex ante in advance what that is? There may be uncertainty as to what the extent of your property rights are, and that can cause problems with investment and decisions about what to do with things. We can try to avoid those problems by maybe going with the first appropriation regime. That's coffin versus left-hand ditch. First appropriator gets the water to the extent that they, uh, to the extent that it's beneficial use and the and their entitlement is limited to the amount that they're the first to take. Idea here seems to be that a just allocation of property resources of resources through property promotes economic development by rewarding initiative, being first, and promoting certainty, stability of expectations here. Advantage of this approach, the first appropriator is probably relatively easy to determine, note I emphasize the word relatively, and it's going to be stable, right? Whoever's first is all going to be first for all time unless somebody has a time machine. Disadvantage, it may not always be obvious who counts as first. We talked about that. And unless there's a reasonableness limitation, then you could have all sorts of crazy stuff happening there because somebody just happened to be first, and that may not be optimal. All right, we've noted the problems before, you know, standard problems of first possession systems. Water is not immune to that. OK, so we've got 3 different approaches, and uh all of them have costs and benefits. Evans versus Merriweather, we then discussed in more detail. The court there rejects the English natural flow approach on the grounds that American law favors productive use of resources and natural flow is bad for that. So instead, it uses a version of the of the reasonable use approach, but that of course then faces it with the question of how to assess whether our use is reasonable or not. How do you determine that? And in addressing that question, it offers a distinction between uses that satisfy natural wants and uses that satisfy artificial wants. Uses that satisfy natural wants always trump uses that satisfy artificial wants. But if you've got two artificial uses competing, then you gotta send it to a jury to figure out what the fair appropriation is between the two of them, but you can never take all of it. If you've got artificial versus artificial, one party can never take all of it, so that wasn't allowed in that case. Coffin versus left-hand ditch, classic statement of the first acquisition approach. The first appropriator of water from a natural stream for a beneficial purpose has a prior right thereto to the extent of such appropriation. Permitted damming the stream, permitted taking all of the water. Evans said no, you can't take all the water. Coffin says, sure, you can take all the water, right, because that was necessary to protect expectations and promote investment. And then we concluded by noting a standard rule of thumb about which rule prevails where in the United States. So in general, rule of thumb, dry western states, first appropriation, everywhere else where water is more plentiful, uh, reasonable use. OK, that was last class. That takes us to today when we have a 4th general principle of allocation. All right, so we've talked so far about allocating property rights on the basis of equality or reasonableness or being 1st. All right. Um, another, uh, uh, principle which we've alluded to in the past, we've touched upon in the past, is that you allocate. Ownership of some resource based on ownership of some other resource. The scope of your rights to one thing depends upon the scope of your rights, the scope of your ownership to some other thing that is presumably related to the first thing. This classically arises in the context of subsurface waters, which we aren't really talking much about, except for right now, right? So you, you know, some water's on the surface, some water's below the surface, that's what you have wells to go down and, you know, slurp up. Well, how do you determine how much water, subsurface water, somebody's entitled to? You could have a first appropriation regime, just however much you slurp out, that's what you get, right? Turns out that's not optimal. It's not optimal for water, it's also not optimal for other things that are below the surface that look kind of like water in certain ways like oil and gas, right. Uh, that causes problems. Um, so a better way of doing it, the law has decided, is to say that the amount of the subsurface pool that you are entitled to is determined by the amount of land above the pool that you own. So if there's a giant pool of water and X owns land that is over 2/3 of that pool of water, then X is entitled to 2/3 of the water. So the ownership of the water, the scope of the ownership of the water depends upon the scope of the ownership of the land. The land and the water are two different resources, but they are linked together by the law, and ownership of one determines the ownership of the other. Um, We had talked about this in the past in the uh notion of doctrines of accession, right, so you own the tree, you own the fruit, you own the cow, you own the calf, you own one thing, it goes with the other thing. Oh. Now, another example of this is some more Latin. I just gotta find a bit of chalk here, man. I gotta say, Brooklyn Law School's excellent in many ways. Columbia's fancier, and the one way in which it's just like obviously fancier is your chalk supply is just massively better, so much better. Like I, I, I like, I like it's a beautiful box of chalk. I don't wanna take it out there, man. Uh. Your chalk is better, but I gotta say, Brooklyn's chalkboards are better, so, you know, it's, it's all a wash. OK, so, um, there is a principle that is in Latin. It often goes by a shorter name, the one I'm gonna give you here, uh, and here we go. All right, Quusest ads est solem eusest ad coilumet ad inferos. Again, my pronunciation is just appalling, so just ignore that. All right, uh, so what on earth does this mean? Oddly enough, the order of the word order in in Latin because an inflected language is just all over the map, right? Uh, nouns have endings, adjectives have endings, and that determines stuff, and so it's just, it's, it's a little challenging here. It's kind of close to English, so we're in pretty good shape. Cuye that's a possessive to whomever is the soil, that's the root for our word soil there, the, uh, the ground. So whoever owns the ground. To him is a coilum up to the heavens, coilum root for our celestial et and ad inferos down to the depths. Inferno, Dante's Inferno, infernal, same thing. All right, so if you own the ground, you own everything above it up to the heavens and down to hell, down to the center of the earth. All right. This is, as you can see, a little bit long, so no one ever actually says this. You just. Say this, it's the ad coil of brew. Sometimes pronounced different ways, but it's that. All right, the ad. Um, So the setup of this, so, the result of this is that we've got. That's planet Earth right there. All right. And here's somebody who owns some land on planet Earth. Looks like quite a lot of it, but for our purposes, good enough. All right, this is the center of planet Earth here. Now because they own that surface, they own legally. A wedge In 2 dimensions, and 3 dimensions it would be a cone, right, or I guess a rectangular prism kind of like thing, uh, and So they own this, right, the surface, they own everything down to here and everything out there as far as you can go. My background is in the humanities. I'm not an astronomer. My understanding is that the universe may actually loop around. I don't know how to deal with that. Um, but potentially it's a problem because like everything up there, right, there are going to be galaxies in here, you know, there's a spiral galaxy there. Star Wars. If you get lucky, maybe your galaxy is the one with the Death Star in it. You own the Death Star. All right. Go the other direction down to the center of the Earth there, you've got a trespass claim against, uh, Brendan Frasier, you know, I don't know, old, old movie. All right, there's 3 of you're going to get that joke and it wasn't good you got it. All right, but, uh, the center of the Earth there, you know, the, you got the magma and you got the like you got the core and you got the, I don't know, you got all that stuff. I learned like in 4th grade, right, you own all of it. Um, because if you own the surface, you own everything above and everything below. That's kind of striking. If you are a literature major, or a literature major as an undergrad, you may have encountered a well-known, I guess it's a book, uh, I only, I only know of it by reputation by William Emson, uh, from like 100 years ago called Seven Types of Ambiguity. Um, he also was a poet, and he wrote a poem, uh, called Legal Fiction in 1928, which is about the Ed Coilum rule. And, uh, I will commend to you the first line of that poem. He says, law makes long spokes of the short stakes of men. Law makes long spokes of the short stakes of men. The idea is, and remember the title of the poem is legal fiction, right? The idea is what you and I as individuals can actually control physically. It's pretty small, right? We got short stakes. We, we, there's not much that we can actually do with it, but law will step in and give us dominion over vastly larger realms. Um, it makes long spokes of the short stakes of men. Which may be somewhat problematic, right, um, should it be doing that? Right, so that's a deep issue. And we're going to talk very soon about some implications of this and why some, you know, one might have some hesitation about this rule. All right, so One potential concern about this is, what if the person who is allocated ownership of this has no actual ability to access the resource. You can't actually get up to the Death Star, so what, why does it make sense to say that you own somehow the Death Star, right? Um, if you can't get to the center of the Earth, why does it make sense that there's a chunk of the center of the Earth that somehow you own? Um, what if the person who owns one thing, say the surface, could access a bunch of this stuff, but chooses not to, for one reason or another. Right, um. Maybe because it's costly and risky. What should the result be then? Alright, well, we see these issues popping up when we talk about the cave case. That's Edwards versus Sims. Alright. Kentucky Intermediate Appellate Court, 1929, page 130. Set up for this is pretty straightforward. Edwards owns some land. On that land he discovers the opening to the great Onyx cave. But it turns out that part of the cave may lie under neighboring land owned by FP Lee. No relation. Um, issue, who owns that portion of the cave? Edwards, the court says, had invested a lot of money in promoting tourism in the cave and improving it. He put in a hotel, he put in walkways and various other things. If we were doing this online or if I didn't fear having to deal with technology, I would show you a slideshow of various images of this. He's actually got like these fancy staircases in there and they got electric lights that are illuminating things. There's a whole bunch of improvements they made. Um, and this was quite successful. It became quite popular, um, and profitable before Lee sued. Lee seeks an injunction against the use of the portion of the cave that is under his land. Hey, don't trespass on my land. We haven't talked about trespass yet, but you've got an intuitive sense right of what trespass is. It's like my land, you don't go in there. Right. So he gets the court to order a survey of the cave to figure out how much of the cave is in fact under the surface of his land. Edwards then seeks a writ of prohibition against the judge, Sims, to prevent him from enforcing the order. Right. Basically on the grounds that doing so would violate Edwards' property rights. Right, so this is, so procedurally what we have here is this is why this is Edwards versus Sims. This is literally in the caption, Edwards versus a judge, right, but the actual dispute is between Edwards and Lee. Now the court in the majority opinion. Majority opinion isn't really all that interesting, it just says, well, Stuff underground. It's kind of like a mine, you know, mines are things underground. And we got a bunch of case law on mines, and the mine case law says, you know, you own the surface, you own bullets below the surface, add coilum rule. So, OK. Own the surface, own what's below the surface, cave is below the surface, so probably owns that. So, uh, refuses to issue a writ of prohibition against Sims to do the survey, says, go ahead, do the survey, find out what FP owns. All right, so, you know, one advantage of having this case in the casebook is it's a straightforward application of the ad coilum rule there. All right. The, um Dissent is, I think, more interesting from a policy perspective, focuses more on policy intuitions. Says that the ad corum rule is not true now and never has been unquote. The rule, the dissent says should be unquote that owners of land own everything on above or below that land. So far that's the ad coilum rule. Everything on, above or below that rule that only to the extent that the owner can both subject that to his dominion and control and use it for his benefit. All right, so you're entitled to descent things only to that surface stuff, stuff in the air, stuff in the ground below, only that portion which you can actually exert control over and use for your benefit. If you can't use it for your benefit, and it might benefit others, the dissent says you should have no right to it. And the dissent then says the owner of land under which a cave exists has nothing of value unless that owner also owns the entrance to the cave. All right, a cave should belong absolutely to him who owns its entrance, unquote. So that's the descent. Uh, the dissent says some other things that I'll talk about in a bit, but I want to pause now and. Invite you to tell me. Who should own the cave? And again, yeah, we have rules. These are, you know, you can make different rules, right? Um, I, I don't know civil law at all, so I am trained in Anglo-American law as most of you will be, as certainly you are to an extent here, maybe exclusively, probably most of you exclusively, uh, here. Um, I am, my recollection is that in Europe, On the continent with a civil law based on Roman law that different rule like ownership of minerals below the surface does not go with the ownership of the surface. Well, there are different ways you could do this. Who should own the cave in this case? I've now got a seating chart, which has names that I can sort of read, but everybody's picture is really tiny, so I'm gonna be like, uh, be squinting and then I've I've, I've asked for a larger one, but it's a. Old person vision. All right, uh. Mrs Ruben?

SPEAKER 1
Uh, yeah, that's me. Um, I found, I think I would go with the entrance position. I, I found the argument that like airplanes flying in the air above people's property, uh like would present an issue if we go with like the purely ad colum perspective. And I feel like once we start making those types of exceptions, it seems silly to like cling to this. Exclusively, so I, I still need to think about it a little bit more, but that's my initial intuition. All right, so you might worry about what the just

SPEAKER 0
the Edcoum rule in general, right? For example, what are you're gonna deal with the air, how are you're gonna deal with airplanes? We will do an airplane case later. Um, the, um, and if you're gonna be worried about it in general, then you gotta think about what the alternative is, and here there is a straightforward maybe alternative. It's like, well, own the entrance, own the cave. It's a similar kind of accession principle, right? Ed Coilum is on the surface, on what's below it. You could have, so your ownership of what's below depends upon your ownership of the surface. You could have a different rule, own the entrance, own the entire cave. Ownership of the cave goes with the ownership of the entrance. All right, uh, I saw some other hands here. Uh, is it Mrs. Belowo?

SPEAKER 2
Yes, correct, um, I was gonna say like I do think I agree with the dissent principle like equity principle of it since, um, Edwards is the one who had put in I guess like the money into into making the cave profitable however. I still think I agree with the majority in the sense that like I think the dissent position works for this case, but I was thinking of like maybe there's like oil under several properties and say that like property owner A has the resources to be able to like. Drill or whatever, but property owner B can't. Like, does that mean that property owner A should be able to take all the oil from under property owner B's like that to me doesn't seem as equitable. So I think the defense position works for this particular fact pattern, but not necessarily. Every case of like subterranean resources.

SPEAKER 0
All right, so good. So a question here, there's one thing helpful that comes out of this comment is pointing out an ambiguity in what the dissent says about the ability to to access the thing. Right, Access the resource. So if you can't exercise dominion over it, then you shouldn't get it, the dissent says. But there are various different ways in which you maybe you can't do things. So one thing is you can't flap your arms and fly to the moon. Right. Try it during the break if you want to. Um, it won't work, right? It's just impossible, right? There are also something else probably most of you, I am guessing, can't. Purchase for cash, Apple Inc. and I don't mean like a share of stock. I mean the whole thing. There may be one or two of you in this room who have enough cash that you can actually do that, in which case I'm not sure what you're doing here, but, uh, welcome to law school. I am. What else are you gonna do with your life? I mean that actually is a big problem that people who are super rich have, like, what else are you going to do with your life? Um, the, um, uh, so you can't do that, right? So there's certain things, but some things you can't do, right, that. Is just because you can't do them, but other people could, right? So, probably, no offense, but probably any of you, if placed on a court with a bunch of NBA basketball players, would be unable to score on the NBA basketball players. No offense, but probably the case there. But that doesn't mean that nobody can score on NBA basketball players, right? Some people can. So the question is like, what kind of can't are we talking about here? So in the example that Ms. Belowo uh gave us, uh, did I get that right? Yes, I think so. Um, uh, gave us here, right, you could have somebody, a situation in which somebody can't access the cave because they just can't afford to spend a million dollars developing a bunch of drilling stuff and so forth to do it, but if they had the million dollars, they could. Um, so how do we flesh that out, and if we're concerned about fairness, maybe it doesn't seem so fair if it's just that you don't have enough money to be able to do it, as opposed to if you, um, like if it's physically impossible. And one way to flesh that out further, right, to make that a little bit, you can make this a little bit more rigorous, a little bit more precise, and like think about, suppose that you own some land. And suppose that underneath it, suppose that the ordinary value of the land is, let's say, just to make up a number, say it's $10,000. And you happen to know, and in fact everybody knows that underneath it. Is a gold deposit that is worth $100 million but you are poor and you cannot in fact access the $100 million of gold that's buried pretty deep beneath your, what did I say $10,000 land, all right. If you're in that situation, what do you do? Yeah.

SPEAKER 3
Um, you find someone who can do it and take a commission?

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, so that's one possibility. You could find somebody who can do it and then say, go ahead, take the gold, you get all the gold except I get 30% or something from it. Um, what is another thing you could do? Yeah is below.

SPEAKER 2
You could sell your subterranean rights maybe to the other property owners who can pay for it.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, you could sell your subterranean rights or even more simply, you could just sell the whole parcel, right? Um. You know, let's assume that it's just like vacant land. It's not where you're living, and so you don't really care about it. It's mainly for investment purposes or something. It's a, it's a store of value rather than something you're actually using. right there, suppose, so now you could like sell this. Now here's the deal, right? If the surface owner owns the stuff below the surface, how much can you get for that parcel? What would the market price be for that? You auction it off. What price are you going to get? Yes, yeah.

SPEAKER 3
The price of the gold less the cost of digging it up.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, so it's something probably in the neighborhood of 100 million, probably not quite there, but you know, close to 100 million. Suppose the rule is that you own only the surface, not the stuff below it. Because you can't access it then. How much can you sell that parcel for? Yeah.

SPEAKER 4
10,000, right, which is 100 bucks.

SPEAKER 0
All right, so even if somebody is incapable of accessing it because they lack the resources to, right, that doesn't mean that they can't actually benefit from being given the legal entitlement to the stuff below it. They will then sell it or they might set some deal where somebody gets a commission for it. Another thing that you might do is actually take out a loan secured by the value of the gold to then get the, you know, to get the money you need in order to mine out the gold. There are various things you can do, right, if you're given that, but if you're not given that, then you may be worked over, right? So then you're going to have much less. So we need to be careful in figuring out what's going on with this. Now here, my guess is that the descent was thinking that it was just physically impossible to access the cave. And if it's physically impossible, then that's it. If the gold is physically impossible to access, period, then the land's only going to sell for $10,000 because you can't get the $100 million in gold. You can just sit on top of it and feel bad that you cannot access the $100 million in gold, like the guy who had all that Bitcoin. I don't know if you remember that story or heard that story, but there's a guy early in the days of Bitcoin mined a gazillion coins and then accidentally threw out the hard drive. And it ended up in some massive landfill, and he's been trying everything to get the hard drive, including like he's willing to pay like the county whatever like massive amounts of money to allow him to go in there and just dig out the entire landfill so we can find the drive that is just filled with Bitcoin from the early days. And they're refusing to let him do it. And I think from what I've read, it may be actually enough time has passed that probably the hard drive has died and probably he couldn't even access the data at this point, but he, he won't give up, right, because he had all this Bitcoin and now he just threw it away, you can't get it. All right, so hang on to your Bitcoin passphrases there and hang on to your. How many people here have backed up their hard drives in the past month? Hold your hands up high. Hold your hands up high. All right, I'm horrified. Uh, um, doesn't happen every year, but like every 3 years or so, I will get an email from a student saying, I don't know what to do. My hard drive died, and it invariably happens about a week before finals, and I have lost all my notes and everything there. Back up your stuff. If you're on a Mac, you can get a time machine. Time machines built in. If you're on a Mac, it's probably something similar on Windows. If you're on a Mac, I will tell you what to do. This will take you 15 minutes total. You buy a hard drive on Amazon. Make it at least twice the size of whatever your internal drive is. If you don't know, you'll get a terabyte and you're good. All right, you will order it. It will show up. That will take you like 3 minutes or whatever. It will then show up. It will come in a box. You open the box. It will have a cable and a drive. You plug one end of the drive, the other end in your Mac. The Mac will automatically detect that this is a hard drive and say, I see that you've put in a new hard drive. Would you like to make it a time machine drive? You click yes. And then just wait and it will back up all your stuff to the time machine drive. Um, the first time you do it, you'll probably have to leave it plugged in for about 20 minutes or so because it takes a while for the first thing. And after that, um, just make sure when you want to go somewhere else, you just eject the drive. And then you plug it in later when you get back and just do that periodically and it will update it and it's Time Machine is super cool because it has this nifty interface for going back in time. It's what's called Time Machine. So sometimes if it happens to be like once every 5 years or so, I mess up a file and I realize, oh jeez, yeah, like a month ago this version of the file was fine and somehow I messed it up. You can actually go back in time and just get the 1 month old version of the thing. You just scroll back in time and you go, yep, yeah, give me this and I'll give you a choice. Do you want to replace it or do you just wanna have a duplicate, a copy of it? Pick which one you want, you want. Anyway, do that, please back up your stuff. There's also a 321 rule for backups here. This is basic backups here, but this is the actual stuff you could use, right? Um, large of a cave is not so useful. Um, but, um, basically the idea is if you have, uh, 3 backups is 22 backups is 11 is none. Um, ideally you want to have an off-site backup, you want to have at least 2 different ways of backing things up and also an off-site backup in case something takes out your apartment, it gets flooded, what's going to happen then? Right. Andy Grove Guy who founded Intel Computer. Super important guy. Wrote his memoirs, titled of the memoirs, Only the Paranoid Survive. Keep that in mind. Old guy advice versa. All right, so, um, we've got uh uh possibility, so we've got an issue here that arises. What should we think about like what does it mean to be able to access the thing? And there are some justice considerations that might arise. OK, so what other things, how many people here think that uh FP Lee, the person who owns the land above the cave but not the entrance, how many people here think that FP Lee should be entitled to the cave? Entitled the cave, the cave below it. All right, hold your hands up high. All right, that's about, I'm guessing 40% maybe of the class. How many of you think that Edwards, who owns the neighboring land and has the entrance to the cave, should be entitled to the whole cave? All right, it's also about 40%, which means I think we've got 20% are non-voters. Yeah, did you want to weigh in? Like, is that?

SPEAKER 4
Yeah, I, I wanna weigh in for the non-voters. Like I feel like a cave or an aquifer should be owned by the city or the national park, um.

SPEAKER 0
All right, so the collective property crowd in the back there and you're all lurking in the back. Not sure what it is, so yes, that should be on there. All right, so why, why a cave owned by, why not everything owned by the government?

SPEAKER 4
I'm worried about like over like extraction and and sort of the overuse of natural resources and a cave is something that. People could aesthetically enjoy um and my understanding also from the case book is that uh there were caves within a national park around this area and it it took quite a long time to be able to incorporate this one.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, so, OK, so there's a whole background to this, which I will get to. I'll say more in a bit, but yes. So there was, um, uh, a bunch of caves here. Um, Mammoth Cave National Park, um, was created out of this stuff. This cave was located within the confines of the surface area of the Mammoth Cave National Park, but was not actually connected to Mammoth Cave. Um, and, uh, eventually, and there's a reason why. They decided to make a national park out of these caves. For one thing, the mammoth cave is like big and like impressive, but also there's a backdrop to this, which is this case is being decided during the Great Kentucky Cave Wars. I did not make up that term. All right, so there is a massive amount of stuff that is going on, uh, at this time in which going to a cave was a super popular thing. Remember, Six Flags and Disneyland don't exist. Holes in the ground are what people had in the past. Right, hey, let's go to the hole in the ground. Right? People today think the world now is like the worst ever. It is not. In the past, people for fun went to a hole in the ground. All right, um, this was a big deal, so you'd go to these things and that led to all sorts of competition which we'll talk about, uh, later, a bit, uh, in, in this, um, and so eventually they decided, you know, one way of dealing with this is let's, let's just make a national park of this. OK, so maybe this stuff should be owned in common. and we are talking about private property in this course. There are things common property, there, there's some common property stuff in the casebook we just don't have time to deal with it. Alright, so maybe this shouldn't be owned by either of them. Now, uh, in talking about depletion of resources, one thing to note. Or to think about, the majority in reaching its decision analogizes caves to mines. It says, well, we got a bunch of mine cases, cave mines are holes in the ground, caves are holes in the ground, it looks pretty good. Um, but there's at least one fundamental difference between a mine and a cave, right, which is that a mine is a resource that you can exhaust. Right, um, you dig out the stuff and then eventually it's played out. The mine just played out and that's it, right? Cave, not necessarily so. You can imagine if you're doing various things that could destroy the cave, but you could in theory, keep using the cave for an extended period of time and preserve it, basically, and would be still productive, um, and not depleted. So should the rules be different for that? And so the suggestion here is in uh Ms. Sebastian, yeah, how do I do with the name pronunciation? Correct. OK, um, uh, is suggesting that it is concerned about uh, uh, depletion of the cave in some sense, you can see how that could happen, right? You can get too many people visiting a thing or something and then it messes it up. Yosemite National Park, which is where I used to go as a kid because I grew up in California. I used to go as a kid to, um. Uh, for family vacations, um. Decades ago when I went there, they had a big problem with just overcrowding there and so over the intervening decades they've put increasingly draconian restrictions on access to the valley, um, because they just have to because otherwise you've just got too many people tramping around. um, and so that that could be a problem, but it's, I think, probably less severe in this case than the context of a mine where it just gets played out and then like it's gone. And so there's a question like maybe this stuff should be owned in common. Um, let's suppose for the purposes of this dispute though, because we have. Yeah, in this particular case, owned in common was not going to be something that was gonna happen, uh, here. Um, and you could see an argument, so give me an argument for why this should not be owned in common. It's gotta be some pro free enterprise person here can tell me, all right, uh, let's see here. Is it Miss Corus Koris.

SPEAKER 5
No, that's OK. There's a lot of vowels. Um, I would argue that why do I have, if I own the land, why do I have to give up everything that's beneath it and like it's kind of arbitrary like at what. Number of feet isn't no longer my land. So is it like 1 inch beneath the soil? Am I allowed to plant a tomato, or like, or is it like 100 ft below the soil? It just feels like an arbitrary cutoff. OK, so they could worry about, uh, administrability and certainty

SPEAKER 0
and predictability here. And if you just say everything, then great. Everything's like encompasses everything. If you say you own some but not everything, then you have to figure out what the sum is, right? And that can be problems for reasons we've talked about like with uncertainty in these contexts. That said, in using the term arbitrary, somebody who wanted to push back on this would say the Ed Coilum rule is arbitrary. I mean, Literary scholar William Emson, poet Emson would say so, right? The poem's called Legal Fiction. He says the law makes long spokes of the short stakes of men, right? Uh, he seems to think that it's kind of arbitrary, that he should be given that. Um, so what other argument might you have for not making this be, uh, in common? Uh, let's see, is it Mr. Fernandez?

SPEAKER 6
That's right. Um, I, I think going back to what we were talking about before. If there's value. In the cave and you are realizing that value as an owner and then the state comes along and takes it away from you, you lose that value and so you go from maybe a house worth millions of dollars to a house worth $10,000 and so it's a bit arbitrary in the time in which the state comes and takes that away.

SPEAKER 0
So you might worry about, uh, losing stuff to the state, um, and, uh, what should happen then. We will talk about that at the end of the course. Very last topic will be eminent domain, um, and so, as you probably know, the government can decide that they want your property and then just take it from you. Alright, I just do that. Yeah, we like that, we're gonna take it from you. Um, and, uh, when they do that, they're generally gonna have to pay you for it. Um, so there's some compensation there, but the amount they pay you may not be the amount that you have on it. Um, if that really outrages you, feel free to occupy one of the buildings here because one of the cases, I don't think we're gonna have a chance to do it in this course, but one of the cases that I used to assign, one of the well-known cases in New York, is the Manhattanville campus for Columbia University was done using eminent domain where they swooped in there and displaced a bunch of folks, and it's kind of amusing. I find it amusing to get these emails from, uh. Uh, the university talking about, hey, we're doing such wonderful things in the community of Manhattanville. There's a historical backdrop to that, um, about why they feel the need to really promote all this great stuff that they are supposedly doing there and maybe they are. I don't know. Um, I live in Brooklyn, um, but, uh, there are, uh, there are issues about, uh, that, um. Betts, your hand's been up for a while.

SPEAKER 7
Because I think I just have a question. I'm not the most informed about property and things like that, so this might sound stupid, but this means it's

SPEAKER 0
gonna be a profound question that we'll be unable to answer. Well, it's like it's gonna be a deep question. All right.

SPEAKER 7
Well, no, I think that's, that's a little. A bit much for me, but, um, I guess I, when I read this, it makes sense to me that if you're not using the subsurface land, then it's kind of like, uh, you have an established ownership of the land like as I read that descent, um, or it just doesn't make, but I guess I'm thinking like if I have a neighbor who just starts digging and they dig a hole all the way under like they just keep digging and they impede on my subsurface, is it kind of like. Don't they have to ask permission for that or like, shouldn't I get some money for the, from that?

SPEAKER 0
Well, you know, so that's the, I mean, that is the question, right? And the question is, should you own the subsurface or not, right? And that's a deep question, right? That's, uh, that is the $64 question. Now the $64,000 question, probably a $640,000 question. I don't know. It used to be the $64 question back before I was born. All right, so that's the, that I mean, it just

SPEAKER 7
feels like I should then, I guess, I guess I'm

SPEAKER 0
against that. There there people have deep intuitions about this, right? Some people are like, well, no, you can't access it, no, or, hey, I like government ownership of things, right? These things should be common, or no, I like individual ownership of things. That, that's mine, damn it, you can't take it from me. Um, uh, and so the question then becomes for a legal system, how do you deal with these intuitions? What do you make of them? How do you rationalize them? How do you decide which ones are going to prevail when not everybody has the same intuition, right? Um, that's going to be the challenge. And if you're somebody. Uh, uh, let me brack bracket that sentence. I'll get back to that later. All right, yeah.

SPEAKER 8
Kind of in response to that question, to me when I read this, it felt like going forward in our readings, it felt like more of an adverse possession thing where like he was using it, there was no dispute, and now you want to come after he's done all these improvements, but like if somebody starts drilling under my land and I'm like, oh I really don't want the pollutants and you're under my land and I wasn't making use of it anyways, but I'm going to go to court and that's my land. I feel like that is an easier way to solve this case more immediately anyways. Yeah, so adverse possession, let's bracket that because we haven't

SPEAKER 0
talked adverse possession yet, but, uh, so there will be a doctrinal reason why adverse possessions aren't gonna work in this case, but we haven't done adverse possession yet, so there's no way to know that. We'll get back to that. Um, there is a question, right, um, with, um. With respect to sort of reliance on these things, you might think somebody has a reliance interest in this, but of course there's going to be an issue of reasonable reliance. What are you allowed, what should you reasonably have relied on, and to what extent should we privilege reliance interests, somebody who's been in a place for a long time. Now with respect to FP Lee, there is potentially a concern, which may well be the concern that's a concern that's motivating the dissent here. Which is that FP Lee sees Edwards do all this stuff, and then Edwards is taking risks. Right, Edwards is investing a bunch of money in building a hotel and putting in all this stuff in the cave, and the result of that risk might be nothing. Right, it might be a flop. People might not want to go to the cave, in which case, Edwards has lost all that money. FP Lee, you can tell a story in which FP Lee sees that Edwards has made this investment, doesn't contribute at all, then sees that the cave is a big hit, and oh, now suddenly this is mine. All right. Do we want to reward that, right? Somebody waiting to see that this has turned out to be beneficial and then coming in to get this. Now this is this touches upon an argument I think that somebody could give against communal ownership of the cave, right, which is, and I think this might be, so this is basically just channeling the dissent here, what the dissent is thinking, right, is that Edwards invested massive amounts of money and took a risk, maybe. Get back to that in a moment, but, uh, maybe invested a bunch of money, like invested, uh, took an enormous amount of risk to build this thing, and then somebody else comes in and says, hey, you know what, yeah, that's great, and because it's great, everybody should have it. That seems maybe unfair to Edwards and maybe not great from a perspective of incentives, right? Is Edwards really going to do that if the payoff for being successful is You got to take it from you. I mean this is one of the striking things. Some of you will experience this. Some of you probably already have experienced this with the economy today for the young people in the tech economy and things like that. So I grew up in what is now Silicon Valley, although I'm old, so when I grew up it was Silicon Valley was south of where I grew up and then it slowly moved north. And one of the things that happens in Silicon Valley now and also back then is that people found these companies and they fail. Left and right, they fail. And then they found another one and it fails, and they found it and it fails. And the most likely result of your going in there and trying to found a company, a tech company, one of these things is you're probably going to have spent your time and your money and ending up with nothing. You're taking enormous amounts of risk, and there are enormous opportunity costs, and you will probably end up with nothing. But probably doesn't mean certainly. You might be making the next Facebook or the next Nvidia. Or the next Apple Hewlett Packard, so the computer revolution is attributed to the personal computer revolution, a lot of this is attributed to Hewlett Packard, and there's a myth, and it's it's a myth like in the sort of platonic sense of like an organizing story, right? Myth of the founders, a couple of guys, and back in the day it was mainly guys in a garage. Coming up with something, right? Coming up with that, have you heard the like the folks in the garage coming up with a thing? How many people here have heard this kind of the story, right? So there is a garage for that. It is the founders of Hewlett Packard. There's a garage in Palo Alto, California. You can go see it. I've been there. It's now owned by the state. All right, um, uh, where this happened. All right. And so that might be you. And so the way we have structured the economy for better or for worse is that we give incentives to people to take these massive amounts of risks. And when you try to find your your company and you fail, that's all on you and the VC folks who funded you, right? But seriously, they're the ones who lose. Taxpayers aren't on the hook. But if a miracle happens and you make it rich. We let you keep the money. That's the deal. We make you keep the money. I did, uh, there was a point in my life I've done a bunch of things and failed at all of them. Um, not at, not at everything I've done, but I've done a bunch of things that I've failed at. One of them was spending a few years of my life working with a guy to set up a hedge fund. Never got off the ground. Had a model, kind of wonder whether the model would have worked or not. Probably wouldn't have with the benefit of hindsight, but I kind of wonder. Anyway, spent a bunch of years, uh, not a bunch of years, but I had 2 or 3 years working on this, right? Not a happy time in my life. Um, it, uh, uh, um, was, you know, unpleasant, but, and it didn't work out. OK. Um, but there was a moment in my life where there's, where for a brief moment after a meeting, it looked like it might have. And I remember walking with the guy I was working with, walking through SoHo, um, by these very expensive apartments, looking and thinking, you know what, I might actually be able to afford one of these things. Um, and candidly, for me that actually kind of made me feel uncomfortable. I grew up middle class. I kind of like being middle class. I like, I was, I was uneasy about having a bunch of money. Like I, I wasn't sure about that. Ended up not getting the money, but um, the thing is, That possibility is like the one thing that makes me feel like I wasn't a complete idiot to have tried it. You know, because it could have worked. I could have made a bunch of money. Would I have been happy with that? Probably not. I'm probably much happier, candidly, as a law professor, but At least I wasn't an idiot. All right, so that's the deal, right? Um, we'll take people who have invested in stuff and taken a bunch of risks and we let them reap the benefits but also internalize the costs of those. The dissent, I think is kind of getting at that, right? The dissent says this. Um, quote, the cave was his, Edwards, right, because he had made it what it was, and without what he had done, it was nothing of value. The value is not in the black vacuum that the uninitiated call a cave. That which Edwards owns is something intangible and indefinable. It is his vision translated into a reality, unquote. Note what the defense's talking about here, ownership, like it's not dirt or buildings or water or a or a whale. It is something, it's like your vision. Somehow it is his person. has been imbued into this cave and he has made something literally out of nothing. He has turned a hole in the ground into something valuable. Meanwhile, FP Lee and his ilk destroy the cave because those who visit it are those who give it value. And none will visit it when the ways are barred so that it may not be exhibited as a whole, unquote. Now that seems overstated to me as it is. I mean, if you go to a museum in New York and if you haven't been to a museum in New York, go to museums in New York. I mean, for crying out loud, that's why you pay so much to live here. They got great museums. Yeah, almost invariably there's one or two rooms that are closed. With my luck, half the time it's one of the rooms I wanted to see, but they don't tell you until you get there. It's like, all right, I'll go in that way. But you still go in, right? Or you go to an amusement park and one or two of the rides are not operating, you still go. Alright, so this seems overstated, but I think we can state the principle in a different way to the same conclusion, right, um, since FP Lee cannot access the cave, it's just physically impossible it seems for FP Lee to access the cave. It's nonsensical to talk about providing FP Lee with incentives to take risks and make investments to develop the cave, to make productive use of the cave, because FP Lee can't do it. There's no point from an incentives perspective to giving FPE rights to this, but there is a point to giving Edwards rights to it because Edwards can access the cave and therefore could internalize the benefits after internalizing the costs of doing the investment. So the incentives to Edwards matter. So that might be a way of thinking about it. Now I think also, as I mentioned before, I think the dissent might also be thinking that FPLE is being kind of a scumbag here and jumping in at the last minute. So that's why FPE and his ill destroy the cave. I think maybe the gloss to put on that is he's thinking that people who want to jump in. And cash in on other people's effort are then going to make it discourage other people from actually putting in the effort because they're running the risk that some jackass is going to show up and say, hey, I now own half your cave. OK, um, A little bit of background on this and then we'll take a break, right. Uh, so Great Kentucky Cave Wars that I mentioned. Caving was super popular. There was a mammoth cave that had like an entrance to it, and it was a giant cave, still exists. Have people ever been to the Mammoth Cave? And I've been a great Onyx game? All right. Mammoth caves in Virginia. I don't know. This is Kentucky. All right, some of the cave, um, the, um. Uh, so the mammoth Cave was a big, uh, giant cave, became a popular attraction. Many people, because it was a popular attraction, many different people tried to find other entrances to the mammoth cave. Um, that was a big thing. Um, question, if you have a rule that says own the entrance, own the cave, what happens if two different people find entrances to the cave? What do you do then? Um, so, uh, potential problem there. Anyway, a bunch of people are trying to find entrances to the mammoth cave. Meanwhile, there's some other smaller caves in the area that existed. And there was a lot of skullduggery that would occur in trying to get tourists to go to these other caves. So your location of the cave mattered a lot, and if you're located near the road, that mattered. If you're located near where the railway station was, that was a big deal. As cars become popular, people are driving to the caves. So what do you do if you have a cave that's not the mammoth cave? Well, maybe you hire some guys to wear uniforms that look like police uniforms to stop cars as they're driving along and say, I'm sorry, the mammoth cave is closed today, even if it isn't. But you're in luck. There's this other cave, if you turn right and go down a half mile, this other cave is open. And so people would do that. Sometimes they didn't always dress like cops. If this were a slideshow, I'd show you slides of the Great Onyx Cave had a thing that said official cave information. And you got guys in uniforms there, but it was just trying to direct people to the Great Onyx Cave. Photos that were taken in 1940 circa 1940. It's kind of wild. You can see three people in the photos except one of the people you cannot see because he's got a newspaper up in front of his face and from two different photos that are taken from the same place and then a completely different angle in which he has turned and he has put the newspaper up in front of his face. He did not want to be photographed. So there's all sorts of wild skulduggery going on, including potential like violence stuff happening here. Um, and so one thing that's going on here, like possibly going on in the background. Is that the court, the majority, may have thought that if we require shared ownership of these caves, then there's less profit to be made from having the entrance to a cave, and there's going to be less incentive for this kind of skullduggery to be going on. Also, at the time this case was being decided, the United States government was attempting to create the Mammoth Cave National Park, and in order to do that, it was having to buy up a bunch of this land. Eventually it had to use eminent domain for some of it because it couldn't get all of it. It took decades to actually assemble all the stuff. And you might think that it was going to be difficult, so it's going to be easier for the government if they just have to buy land from people who own the entrance to caves rather than people who happen to own land that's on top of caves as well. Assembly problems, holdout problems, right? You just got more people you have to deal with. So maybe it's advantageous, maybe the court's thinking in the back of their mind, it's advantageous to have. Uh, sorry, the descent would be a thing in the back of its mind, be advantageous to have a situation in which, oh, just the, you only have one person you have to negotiate for that cave, you only have one person you have to negotiate with. Um, Alternatively, so this is everything gets complicated, right? Alternatively, maybe my economic analysis on that last point is wrong and it might be that actually the majority was thinking this because the majority might be thinking that if you need to buy up land, buy it up from Edwards if Edwards only is entitled to a third of the cave. It's going to be going to be cheaper and FP Lee is probably going to put a low price on the case because FP Lee can't actually access it. Maybe. I don't know. This is why economics is hard to actually figure out these things, but there are these various considerations might have been floating around in the background. Remember, cases are decided in a context. Judges are human beings who know stuff. They know what's going on. They're trying to come up to optimal outcomes where the stuff that's written down in the case may not be everything that's going on that people actually care about. For better and for worse, judges may be biased in all sorts of bad ways, and that may be affecting what's going on, but they may also be, and you know, that may affect what happens in a case, but they may also just have, you know, sensible views about things that are going on. They're trying to, you know, deal with problems that exist. All right, if you're interested in Great Kentucky Cave Wars, there's actually a lot of literature on it, so you can, you can read a bunch about this. All right, any questions on this? Yeah Yeah, so I know you mentioned like the different

SPEAKER 9
approaches that sort of like that are like evident within like the majority and the dissent here, but I was wondering like where do courts typically like fall today when it comes to like uh uh uh coelum um issues? Are they gonna be taking more of like the dissent understanding of it, or are they gonna be doing like maybe government ownership or something like this, one of the two, the, the approaches that we talked about, which one?

SPEAKER 0
Good question. I don't know like that's an empirical question. One of the challenges of American law, unlike if you get to learn law in Europe or something, in America we have 50+ jurisdictions, right, which has different rules. But I will say in general the hard ad coilum rule. If you just own everything down to the surface center of the earth and everything above you, that is, I don't know that I have encountered a case that actually just embraces wholeheartedly, oh yeah, unmodified ad coilum rule. Um, I think the basic principle that you own, yeah, a bunch of stuff above your land and a bunch of stuff below your land. That is, I think, pretty universal in American law. But what the limits are, but I think it's also pretty universal that there are some limits on that. And what those should be then becomes. An issue and we will come back to this when we talk about the airplane case. So we've got an airplane case, kind of cool airplane case that we'll get back into this issue. All right, it's excellent question. I think the answer is in general the ad coilum rule in general is basically American law, but there are limits on it, and those limits may depend on what we're concerned about. OK, I like the particular issue that we're concerned about. Does that make sense? That, yeah, OK, great. All right, let's take a break. When we come back in 10 minutes, we will talk about a famous case about a poor kid who finds a jewel. Yeah, see you in town. What um. Yes. What I. I Well, right, so it turns out that we haven't done trespass yet, but trespass is a strict liability. All right, so we're gonna do a case Jacques B. Steinberg Hans. Which Um So by way of preview, spoiler alert, I'm about to spoil a case that you're going to read, but in Jay Steamer homes, you've got somebody, a company trespassing on somebody's land. There's basically zero actual injury. The court awards $1 in nominal damages and then allows, I think it was like $100,000. It's been a year since I worked the case, $100,000 in punitive. Because it was in the very act of infringing the right to exclude is deemed to be a homic, right? And why would that make sense? Well, I think the basic thinking is that um. Even if I myself am not benefiting from say uses a cave or whatever, I could sell the rights to somebody else who they want to protect that, but we'll talk about this in the context of Jacques Prestein Bones, and we will throw open the question of is this rightly decided or not because there is. You might think that it's not rightly decided, but doctrinally, the answer is tortoises trespass is a strict liability to tortures, so you don't need to show any actual injury in order to get at least nominal damages, and nominal damages may serve as a basis for punitive. Now, so now maybe if punitive damages aren't. Appropriate, then it may be you only get nominal damages, in which case it's one buck, in which case nobody cares. So it's one of those things of which you might. Formally be entitled to a judgment. Um, but as a practical matter, you lost even though you won. So you bring the suit, it's a trespass suit, and I sue and I win. Yay! What do I win? $1. Well, I just lost. Um, so that's how that works out. So and your intuition, I think is right and the law sort of handles that, but you can get um. Oh Nominal damages which punitives and again another case we haven't talked about yet, when you get repeated trespasses, you would in this case. People doing a tour routine then you may be able to get injunctive relief, which is. FP Lee was seeking, you made that repeated trespasses may be grounds for having an injunction saying stop doing that. And so. There you go. But now there's so. Basic principle which we haven't talked about yet, sort of alluded to talk about is that in American property law you have a strong right to exclude infringements of that right by themselves can be actionable. Now that said, we will then have a bunch of classes. All of the exceptions to thes strong right to exclude. We have a strong right to exclude unless, and then there's a long list of things that says, well, so it's not quite as strong as it might look from the first class we do on this. Um, we'll see how that plays out over the course. I took an environmental law undergrad and we did Penn Central and I remember like tight restriction. Yeah, we'll do Penn Central at the end of the course. OK. Thank you. Oh yeah Hi I think I. Yeah Um, I think I. Right I Yeah. Yeah. Get out here. OK, let's get back into this. They plan ahead here by giving two labs in case the battery dies on one. The battery's now died on both, so I am going to have to use this, and if you can't hear me with this, you can't hear me, period. So we may be getting another lab coming in, but Mike. This sucker's just dead. All right, so I hope you'll be able to hear me. All right, one last note, I forgot to mention I said that I would say something about this. I just forgot to mention this. Edwards may have been a scumbag. Um, so it's not clear that Edwards actually found the entrance to the Great Onyx Cave. There may have been somebody else who found, it looks like there was somebody else who may have actually found it, that Edwards thought there might have been an entrance and so hired somebody else to do it and then promised to split it fifty-fifty with this other person, and then the other person found the entrance and then Edwards just cut him out. And didn't give him anything, and my recollection is it's been a while since I looked into this, that this guy then sued Edwards. Uh, to claim that, hey, I'm the one who actually found the cave. I'm entitled to this. And then unfortunately he just died before his suit was decided. So Edwards skated. So maybe Edwards was actually, you know, kind of a jerk, kind of a sharp operator, and maybe that was, maybe the majority knew that, and so that may have been playing a role in deciding that, you know what, Edwards, maybe you don't get the full cave here. Maybe FPE gets some of this. I don't know. Anyway, fun facts about the cave. All right. So far in this course we've been talking about how one might acquire. Legal entitlement to ownership of certain things, uh, both of these, the batteries both seem dead. Oh, OK. Oh, I'm about to learn something here. I'll change it for you. All right, keep going. Is that something? Is that a user operator thing that I could actually do? We go around to the rooms. I don't have time to keep going, so we always keep them in, um. Oh, I bet even I can replace those. They're just double A's. Sweet. All right, I learned something new. So One as well. OK. So all the things we've been talking about having ownership of to this point have been things that have not been owned by anybody else. So you got whales, you've got foxes on the beach, you've got water flowing in a natural stream, you got things below the surface, it's stuff that nobody else owned. But what happens if what you come to possess is something that in fact somebody else. Green lights on. OK, uh, that somebody else. Had already owned, had previously owned, you're not the first possessor, you're at best the second possessor. Now, that happens all the time, unproblematically, right, uh. You're familiar with this happening in context of voluntary transfers. You go on Amazon to buy something, and you do. Well, you're not the first possessor, but that's not a problem. You just acquired something through a voluntary transfer from somebody who is an owner, or you give somebody something as a gift. Again, voluntary transfer there, not a problem. So if uh uh I uh buy something from a store and give it to you as a birthday gift, then we've got a situation in which we had an original owner. And then I end up being the owner and then you end up being the owner. All right, we can see that ownership transfers to the voluntary, uh, that ownership transfers because we have voluntary transfers. All right, straightforward. But what if there's a chain of possession that has some other link in it rather than a voluntary transfer? Who then prevails or should prevail in disputes over ownership of the property? Armory versus Delore is a famous case that we have on this. King's Bench, 1722, page 117. The plaintiff, a chimney sweeper's boy, found a mounted jewel. Alright, so it's a jewel in a setting, so we got some metal and then we got a jewel, yeah. All right, um Something to know about chimney sweepers, boys. Um, this is not a desirable occupation. All right, so, quick history of humanity here is once upon a time, there's a bunch of people who have evolved and so now they're Homo sapiens. Maybe Homo sapiens, maybe Homo erectus or something figured out fire first, but at some 0.1 of them figures out fire. That's pretty good, because now you can heat things up, you can cook things. Then somebody figures out, hey, let's put the fire inside buildings. And that's pretty good, but you need some way for the smoke to disappear, so you create chimneys. So we got now fire in buildings, we got chimneys, and that turns out to be works works well domestically, but also for industry. And for industry you've got bigger fires, bigger chimneys. Everything's great, but the fire's putting out smoke. The smoke, it turns out, will stick to the side of the chimneys, and over time that builds up. As it builds up, the diameter of the chimney gets smaller and smaller and smaller. It doesn't work well. Air can't flow through it. You've got a problem, so you need to get the chimney cleared out. So what do you do? You hire the professionals. Those are the chimney sweepers. Chimney sweepers come and they clean out the chimney. How do you do that? Well, if it's a really small one, you can just use a long-handled brush, but a lot of them are not really small, so you can't do that. So you need to have something that will fit to go in there to do that, and the chimney openings are small, so what will fit? The only thing that will fit are very young children. So you stick the very young children in there and you have them scrape out the soot. OK, that works pretty well when it works, which is most of the time, but these industrial enterprises often had really long chimneys, and sometimes the very young children would get stuck in there. And when that happened, sometimes they got rescued, sometimes they did not, so they just eventually dehydrated to death in the chimney. So this work is very low status and very dangerous. William Blake, famous poet, wrote a famous poem on that topic called The Chimney Sweeper. It was published in two parts, one in Songs of Innocence, 1789, 1 in Songs of Experience five years later, 1794. The first poem sets up the second. The second one has the punchline. The poem was highly critical of what Blake took to be the church's, uh, either, uh, tolerance of or maybe even complicity in the exploitation of these young children. Why would anybody actually get this job, take this job, the chimney sweeper's boy? Because your parents basically sold you off to the chimney sweeper, right? It was called apprenticeship. The chimney sweeper would provide food. And a place to sleep, in training, in the trade, and if you lived long enough, then you could yourself grow up to be a chimney sweeper and then get chimney sweepers boys yourself and go out and do that. But what we're talking about here is somebody who, if not at the very bottom rung of society, is as close to the bottom rung of society as anyone would ever care to be. Alright. Extremely. Low status, low income, low prospects. All right. The defendant was pretty much the opposite. Uh, was the case, as a goldsmith. Paul Delomere was actually a silversmith. Formerly he was a member of the Goldsmith's Guild, and he was goldsmith to George the First. However, his fame comes almost exclusively from his silversmithing, and he was famous. According to the Victoria and Albert Museum, museum over in the UK, he was the greatest silversmith working in England in the 18th century. So this, he finds this, so the kid finds this jewel, takes it to a jeweler, Paul Delamere. This is not an ordinary jeweler that he is taking it to. This is not sales or key jewelers here, right? If you want to have a sense of what he's doing. Go down to Central Park, south end of it. Start walking down 5th Avenue, and when you get to Tiffany and Company, keep on walking to Mass Market. When you cross 55th and get to Harry Winston, then you go in. All right. So, uh, Delore, super prestigious, super high status, very wealthy. Delamere's work is in several museums. I believe the Frick Collection here has some of his silver, so you can check it out. All right. There were also various incidents reported in which Delamere engaged in practices that were viewed at the time as sharp dealing, uh, some sketchy business practices that were not approved of by the Goldsmith's Guild. So this guy, super wealthy, I don't know how wealthy he was, but well, you know, super successful. And maybe not the most scrupulous guy in the world. All right, he's got a shop though. The plaintiff, the silversmith's boy, the, uh, sorry, chimney sweeps boy takes the jewel to the jewelry shop. There, Paul Delamere is not working the front desk, unsurprisingly, he's got an apprentice who's doing that. Uh, the chimney sweeps boy gives the jewel to the apprentice, um, to say, hey, figure out, you know, what this is worth, and the apprentice then goes to the back, supposedly to weigh it. When he comes back, he says, uh, this is actually worth very little, and offered the defendant, offered the plaintiff, the chimney sweeps boy, 3 ha hats. You adjust that for inflation in today's money. Approximately $1.55. 55. Think about the scenario here, right? This kid has found a jewel. This kid probably has a life expectancy of about 4 more years or so, not very good. Does not have good life prospects. Finds this jewel. This may be the kid's ticket to a decent life. Goes to the jewelry shop and the apprentice goes in the back, comes back and says, I'll give you $1.55 for it. So the kid says, no, not taking that. Right, um, is given back not the jewel, but just the empty socket, right, so the metal bit, but not the actual jewel. Give that back, sues. So who's entitled to it? Well, formally what we have here is a sequential possession situation. In which we have first the jewel's true owner, and we don't know who that is. Um, Then the chimney sweeps boy who finds it. And then the goldsmith's apprentice, who takes it without permission. So the question then is, who should be entitled to the jab? Now, the easy but useless answer is, well, the true owner is entitled to the jam. Which is correct, legally correct, but does us no good because the true owner, we don't know who that is. We've got a dispute now between two other people who are not the true owner, and each of them can say to the other, you're not entitled to it. The true owner's entitled to it. So who should have priority here when neither of them's really entitled to the jewel? And the court famously holds that a finder, quote, though he does not by such finding acquire an absolute property or ownership. Yet he has such property as will enable him to keep it against all but the rightful owner, unquote. So if you find Something if you're the finder. You do not have an absolute property right, by which is meant you do not have a right that is good against the entire world. But you do have a right that's good against the entire world except the true owner. So Chimney sweep's boy finds it. He therefore has rights good against the entire world except the true owner. Goldsmith isn't the true owner, so therefore chimney sweep Boys rights are good against the Goldsmiths as well. Alright So the kid's entitled to the jewel. Now, what's the rationale behind this Court doesn't tell us, or more precisely, the report of the case doesn't tell us, says. This is the outcome. Kid wins. This is the rule. Why is that a good rule? We don't know what the court was thinking. The court may have said something about it, but it's not reported. So remember how legal literature works at this time. Judges are not writing opinions. Unlike today, where judges write opinions and publish them, that is not happening. Judges say things in court and somebody may write them down and then publish them. Some of them may be law students actually. One way you would learn law is you go to work at a law firm and you're basically apprenticed there and they would just have you sit in the courts and listen to what people are saying and sometimes you write stuff down and so now you get notes on cases. Turns out those were kind of useful, so people would make money taking down notes and doing that. But we don't know what they took down. They may, there may have been an explanation and that discussion just wasn't in the notes. So all we have is a statement of the rule. We don't know the reasoning behind it. Um, now the court does do something else interesting here. It now that it's decided that the kid's entitled to the jewel. It's got to figure out what the value of the jewel is because the way this is working here, the remedy under English law at the time would have been money damages. Wouldn't couldn't sue to get the jewel back, but you could sue to get the value of the jewel, which probably is all the kid cares about, right? The kid is a chimney sweeps boy. He's not like, well, man, I was just really hoping to wear that to the opera. I'm hoping the opera season there. No, the kid wants the money, so that's fine. Um, but now the court's got to figure out, well, what amount of damages to award. And presumably the appropriate amount of damages is the value of the jewel, because that's what the kid was entitled to and what the kid's been deprived of. But how can the court figure out what the value of the jewel is since the jewel isn't in the court. Alright, um, so the court does this, it directs the jury that quote, unless the defendant did produce the jewel and show it not to be the finest water, water is the color and transparency of the jewel, it's a measure of its quality. So unless the defendant did did produce the jewel and show it not to be of the finest water, they, the jury, should presume the strongest against him and make the value of the best jewels the measure of the damages. And the jury then did that. Now this is an example of what today academics would refer to as an information forcing rule. In a situation in which we have an information asymmetry. One party has information that the other party doesn't have, um, and it is relevant to determining the case, right? We want to structure things so that the party that has the information has an incentive to bring it into court. Remember that in Anglo-American jurisprudence, courts do not have independent investigative powers. Not true in civil law jurisdictions, but that's the way we do it here. Right in an American court or an English court, the court can know only what it is that the parties have brought in. Uh, to them. All right, so how do we do this? We identify the party that has the information asymmetry, that has the information. And then impose upon that party a very unpleasant presumption. We are going to presume that the information is very, very bad for you, but make it a defeasible presumption. So then if they bring in the information and show, oh, the assumption was that the presumption was incorrect, fine, great, you've now established what the correct answer is and there we are, we run with that. So now they have incentive to do that. So here, they say tell the jury. Impose the amount of the measure of damages is going to be whatever is the most expensive jewel that could have fit in there. And if it turns out that the actual jewel was not the most expensive jewel, well, now Delamere has a strong incentive to bring the actual jewel in, and then he can bring in some independent appraisers to figure out what it's worth, and then then you're good. All right, um, so, uh, that is a clever thing that the court did. Uh, you will see courts, this is, there's a whole bunch of literature on this. It may, you may have talked about in contracts the penalty default literature. So, uh, this relates to the idea of penalty defaults in contracts too. All right, um, any questions on that? Alright, yeah.

SPEAKER 9
Yeah, I just want to get a clarification. So you said about for the prong about um. The, the presumption against the, the person with the information, um, and that's just sort of to incentivize that they bring about like the actual. Like, look, what, what, can you just go over again like what was the presumption for what the basic idea

SPEAKER 0
is, suppose we got, um, um, uh, somebody who has information that we want to bring into the court, right right, so we give them a very unpleasant assumption. So here, here's a way we could do this, and I say I want to give very strong incentives to you to participate. I wanted to know what you're thinking about something. Right, um, that, uh, what your answer is to something, right, and I'm going to grade you on it. I'm not, that's not the way we're doing the class, but I'm going to grade you on that, right? So I want to, uh, do that. So I'm gonna say, I'm going to establish a presumption that you are all utterly ignorant and know nothing. Each one of you has an F level of knowledge about the thing that I want. That now gives, but it's a defeasible presumption. I say, if you could show me that your level of knowledge is better than that, then you don't get an F. All right, if I'd set up things that way, you would have a strong incentive to show me what your knowledge is of the thing, right? Because you don't want the F and your knowledge is almost certainly way better than the F. So then you do, then you participate and then you talk, and then, OK, then we get that, right? Um, so what you do is you create. An incentive to produce information by imposing a presumption, a defeasible presumption that the information is very, very bad for the party that has the information. So then they have an incentive to come in and show that that's not the case. That make sense? OK, great. Um, one question that neither you nor anybody at Brooklyn had makes me mildly sad that none of you cared about what happened to the kid. What happens to the kid? Like the kid have a happy life? What happened? Nobody knows. Nobody knows. Sorry. Um, a lot of professors have looked into this. Like we've done a lot. I, I, I myself have not, but my profession has done a lot to try to find out what happened to the kid, and it's just vanished from the historical record. We do not know. So we can, unlike a penalty default sort of thing here or an information forcing rule, we are free to assume that the kid had a happy life, went on to have a happy life, and there we are. Yeah, for all we know it's true. OK, um, a difference. So now we've got people who are first possessors, we talked about them, and now we've got people who are finders, like first finders. Um, an important difference between a finder and a first possessor is that a finder's taking possession of the object does not make the finder the absolute owner of it, right? The true owner is still the absolute owner of it. That means that finders have obligations to the true owner, right. Um, it is often said, and this doesn't mean anything to you now, it will later, that the finder acts as a bailee. For the true owner, that doesn't mean anything to you because we haven't done bailments yet. We will do bailments though, and that it'll mean something to you so you can write it down now and it'll mean something to you later. The basic idea is that the finder has various duties, a duty to try to return the object to the true owner, and the true owner is entitled to sue to get the property back. Um, there is law on this, so here's some law you can use. New York State and New York City has laws governing found property. Which uh inform you as to the duties you have as a finder. So this is in the New York state laws in New York personal property sections 251 to 258. If the found property, the property that you find, is worth less than $10. Then you must make reasonable efforts to find the true owner, and if you are unable to do so after those reasonable efforts, after a year, then you may keep the property. If the found property, that's in Section 257, if the found property is worth $20 or more, then you must turn the property into the police within 10 days. The police then must hold the property for a specified period of time. It's written in the statute. It varies depending on the value of the property. It could be up to 3 years. If at the end of that period of time, the true owner has not claimed it, then you are entitled to own that property. That's in Section 252. I, this may strike you as surprising. You may not have realized that about New York state law on found property. Um, the statute was added in 1958, and apparently they were just all the numbers there were $10 back in 1958. Um, if you adjust $10 in 1958 to inflation for inflation in today's money. It's about $100 100 dollars to $120 in today's money. So it's a little bit more. At some point, people realized, I guess we need to adjust this for inflation, so they amended Section 252 to be $20 but they haven't updated it since. Failure to comply with the law is a misdemeanor. You can be fined up to $100 and or spend 6 months in prison, up to 6 months in prison. But there is no liability if you find a thing that's worth more than $20 and if instead of turning it into the police, you turn it into whoever owns or possesses the property that you find it on. So if you find something, if you find an iPhone in Rockefeller Center and turn it in at the front desk of one of the buildings in Rockefeller Center, you're good. You don't have to worry about going to jail. All right, um. What if the property is worth between $10.20 dollars, say $12.50. We don't know. It's sheer chaos. There's no law governing that. Why is this? My guess is because it used to be $10 for Hang on to it for a year, make reasonable efforts. More than $10 then you got to turn to the police. They amended the section, that latter section to be $20 but they appear not to have realized that there was another section that said that you had to make reasonable efforts for the $10 thing, so they didn't amend it. Note that the people who draft statutes may not be good at their jobs, right? They just they screw stuff up. So, uh, right now it's kind of chaos there. It is a lawless zone for something worth $12.50 except not if it's in New York City. If you're in upstate chaos, but if you're in New York City, there's a New York City statute that is very similar and it's just 10 bucks is the cutoff either way. But New York City is really serious about this, so the penalties are harsher in New York City if you don't comply with it. Failure to comply shall be punished by a fine of up to $1000. And or imprisonment up to one year. All right, so if you find something worth $12 in New York City and you don't turn it in to the cops. You're going to Rikers. It's not messing around with that. Like, does anybody actually pay attention to this? No, of course not, because nobody knows it. But you could be. All right, so we've got some rules on that. Um, now we can now consider some variations on the armory. Scheme. All right, so in armory we have true owner, followed by a finder, followed by a finder. Sorry, followed by a converter. True owner, followed by a finder, followed by a converter. Converter is somebody who takes property without permission. Right, but what if we've got true owner followed by a finder, followed by a later finder. True owner A loses the item, B finds it, but then loses the item, C finds it. On the armory rule, we've got a problem on its face because the armory rule says a finder's rights are good against all the world except the true owner. So if A was a true owner, B finds it and loses it, C finds it and loses it, B has rights good against all the world except A, that includes C. C has rights good against all the world except A, that includes B. So both B and C have rights good against each other. Ah, what do you do? Clark versus Maloney addresses this. What if we have true owner followed by a converter followed by another converter. What happens then? That's Anderson versus Goldberg, and punchline in all of these scenarios, the earlier possessor wins with Clark versus Maloney, Delaware Superior Court, 1840, page 119. Setup is simple. True owner had pine logs that are washed away. Plaintiff finds them, loses them again. Defendant finds them. The court says this quote, It is a well settled rule of law that the loss of a chattel does not change the right of property. Chattel is personal property, not dirt and buildings. The loss of a chattel does not change the right of property. And for the same reasons that the original loss of the logs by the rightful owner did not change his absolute property in them, so the subsequent loss did not divest the special property of the plaintiff. Absolute property good against all the world, Special property good against almost all the world, but not everybody. Alright, so the basic idea is straightforward and it makes sense. You own an iPhone, it falls out of your pocket. You've lost it. Does this mean you lost your property rights to it? No, you still have perfectly good property rights to your iPhone. The fact that you lost your iPhone doesn't change your property rights. So it should then follow that the first finder then has rights good against all the world except you. If the first finder loses the phone, then. Well, that doesn't change the first finder's property rights, and the first finder's property rights were good against all the world except the true owner. So after losing it, they're still good against all the world except the true owner. So the second finder then would have rights that are at best good against all the world except the true owner and the first finder. All right, that kind of makes sense. All right, that's fairly straightforward. Anderson versus Guldberg, again, simple setup. True owner, more pine logs, had pine logs on his land. Plaintiff cut them down without permission. Then brings them to a sawmill where the defendant takes them without permission. True owner, converter, converter. And the court says the first converter wins. Possession is good title against all the world except those having better title, and one who acquires possession of property and being a later converter isn't better title. Quoting the court. One who has acquired the possession of property, whether by finding bailment or mere tort, has a right to retain that possession as against a mere wrongdoer who is a stranger to the property. Why is this? Court tells us any other rule would lead to an endless series of unlawful seizures and reprisals in every case where property had once passed out of the possession of the rightful owner. So basically you don't want to give incentives to people to steal or otherwise convert property that has been converted by somebody else, right? We want to discourage that sort of thing, so we just say no, the first converter has rights that are good against other people who try to steal it from them. Um, all right, so that's it. So basically in all of these scenarios, in every single one of them, the first person to come upon it gets it. All right, any questions on that? All right, You're done. Have a great weekend. Stay warm, stay dry, and if you find any property, you now know what to do with it. See you on Tuesday. Any questions? $30 for just. Oh. So I will eventually be up in my office, but I'll probably be chatting with people here and then walk up, so yeah, OK, whatever you want.
