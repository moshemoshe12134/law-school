SPEAKER 1
OK, sound check. How audible, Alex. Sound check in the back. Can you hear me? All right, good. OK. OK, folks, welcome back. Uh, reminder, next week our schedule is going to be unusual because we're not meeting on Tuesday. There will be a makeup session. On Friday, so my, my week next week is going to be weird. I don't teach on Monday and I teach Tuesday and Wednesday at Brooklyn and Thursday and Friday here, which means I'm terrified that there's like a 50% chance that I will end up in the wrong part of the city one of those days to teach property. So we'll try to avoid that. and remember. If you can make the Friday session, it will be recorded. Uh, if you can't, I completely understand if you have other obligations or just other things you'd rather do with your Friday. Um, the, uh, uh, our meeting time and our meeting place are different. So it's at 11:30 a.m., so from 11:30 to 1:20, and we are across the elevator bank. We're in 104 rather than 103 on Friday. OK, uh, we began last class by starting to see some complications that can arise if you have a right to exclude, a strong right to exclude, um. If you have a strong right to exclude, it makes a big difference how broad the scope of that property right is, how much of the world is your property. We see this with the ad coilum rule. We had touched upon it before in the context of caves, owning things below the surface of your land. Last class we saw in the other direction with air rights, things above the surface of your land. Hinman versus Pacific Air Transport. The court holds that a right to exclude does not extend infinitely upward, but only to as much of the air space above the surface as the owner actually uses and only so long as he or she is actually using it. Although the lander still has rights to prohibit certain uses of the air that actually interfere with the owner's use or of his or her property of the land itself, and maybe depending upon how you read it, maybe of the airspace, you know, the court's language is a little ambiguous there, and we'll see that issue return, the interference with use. We'll see that issue return later when we talk about the law of nuisance. Trespass, what we're talking about now is about possession, which means like keeping people off your property physically. What if somebody's not coming on your property but is interfering, doing things that interfere with your use of the property? Well, we'll talk about that later when we talk about nuisance. All right, then we turn to the question of repeated trespasses. What if we have a trespass that unlike in Jacques V Steinberg Homes, which is one time going across the property to deliver the mobile home. Um, Instead happens over and over again. Baker versus Howard County Hunt is a case we have on this, addresses the question of whether injunctive relief is available to stop such trespasses. The Hunt Club's dogs had repeatedly gone on Baker's property, interfering with his animal experiments and causing other trouble. The court first concluded that Baker did in fact have a valid trespass claim. Then, given that, we have to ask the question, what remedy do you have for that? The request was for injunctive relief. The court said that injunctive relief would be available to stop such trespasses. In coming to that conclusion, it stated a couple of the standard traditional requirements for equitable relief, including injunctions. There must be no adequate remedy at law, and the plaintiff must come into court with clean hands. The court said that Baker's having used self-help against a trespassing dog didn't constitute unclean hands. Baker's hands were clean enough and also said that there was no adequate remedy at law for two reasons. One is that the damages were intangible and incapable of measurement, basically impossible to calculate with reasonable certainty. And independently, the defendants had manifested an intent to keep doing what they were doing, which means that if the plaintiff were limited to recovery in damages, the plaintiff would have to keep going to court over and over and over again to sue for the damages, and that's very burdensome on the poor plaintiff and also not so great for the court. Then we discussed the issue of continuous trespasses. These are trespasses that don't happen repeatedly but are happening all the time around the clock, uninterrupted rather than intermittent, and we had two cases with nearly identical facts but opposite outcomes. In Pyle v. Pedrick, we have an accidental and nearly de minimis encroachment. That was deemed to be sufficient to justify issuing an injunction against the trespasser requiring, removal of the encroachment at great expense. Golden Press versus Rylands very similar facts, but the result is the opposite. The only remedy the court said there would be damages for the market value of the encroachment, which is basically the market value of the land that is being occupied by the few inches of the foundation going across the property line. Um, The court was concerned about unequal bargaining power if it issued an injunction. Bargaining, we noted, is done in the shadow of the law, and the issuance of a judgment doesn't end the interaction of the parties. People have entitlements to various things. They trade them all the time. This is just. Boringly familiar to all of you in your ordinary life, you buy things, you buy groceries, you go to Lenfest, you buy a bottle of water, you buy something on Amazon, right? You, you don't have a right to a thing, but you have a right to the money, then you exchange the right to the money for the right to the thing, right? Well, that can happen after a judgment too, right? All that happens there is after the judgment, we now have a clearer and perhaps a different idea of who is entitled to what, what the entitlements are. The court is concerned that the content of the judgment. Can affect what happens to that bargaining. And is concerned about tilting the bargaining table, the playing field too much in favor of the plaintiff by issuing the injunction. The party that is given a legal entitlement to force somebody else to do something really expensive has a lot of leverage over that other party. This concern implicitly reflected a third traditional requirement for equitable relief that granting an injunction would not impose an undue burden or an undue hardship on the defendant. Sometimes that's cashed out in terms of balancing the hardships. The basic idea is that if issuing the injunction is going to be way more burdensome on the defendant than not issuing the injunction would be on the plaintiff, a court of equity shouldn't do that, and the court thought that was true in this case. Super expensive to dig out the foundation for the factory, but the injury, the actual injury to the plaintiff is just $55. But the court said if the injunction had been done willfully, different story. If the injection had been done willfully, then yeah, all bets are off there. Then you've just been a jerk. And so yeah, we might issue an injunction then. All right, um, one thing that I just want to highlight, I did not, I ran out of time before the end of the last class, but I'll just mention it now because it's a nice sort of doctrinal thing that you can write down and law students like the doctrinal things that they can write down, um, uh, so, uh, the way the Golden Press, uh, court put what they say is, um, basically the rule where you have an unintentional encroachment, right, where it's done by mistake, they say this quote, where defendant's encroachment is unintentional and slight. Plaintiff's use not affected and is damage small and fairly compensable. While the cost of removal is so great as to cause grave hardship or otherwise make its removal unconscionable, mandatory injunction may properly be denied and plaintiff relegated to compensation and damages. OK, so if you've got an unintentional encroachment and it's just not that big, right, so plaintiff's use is not affected, his damage is small and fairly compensable. Fairly compensable means, you know, adequate remedy at law, right? You could have money damages, the adequate compensation for that. And on the other hand, cost of removal, it would cause grave hardship or otherwise be unconscionable, well then in those circumstances, you shouldn't issue the injunction. And you should limit the plaintiff to their fairly compensable damages. All right, um, I will also note when we're talking about so we now have two injunction cases the Undue hardship rule is absolutely bog standard bit of equity analysis. The Baker versus Howard County hunt. Court doesn't mention it, uh, presumably because they thought it just wasn't dispositive there or maybe they screwed up. Sometimes courts screw up. I don't know, but they didn't mention it, but just the fact that they didn't mention it does not make this case weird as an outlier. This is completely normal what the court is doing. OK, uh, a little bit of legal theory now, as if there hasn't been any so far in this course, uh. But you're Columbia, so you all love the legal theory. Um, alright, uh, some lingo. Oh, first time all semester there's a bit of chalk outside the chalk thing, but it's also intact. I don't know, it's, it's kind of creeping me out like what happens to the like the little chunks of chalk like they disappear. I don't know, it seems. Seems scary. All right, uh, so we've got ex ante. Versus expost. Yeah, these are terms that have application in a wide range of contexts, but here we're drawing a distinction, uh, between them for ways of thinking about, you know, what perspective to take on resolving the outcome of a suit. All right, so a court is looking at some situation or maybe a student writing a note or a professor writing a law review article, looking at some sort of situation and trying to sort out, uh, what should be done here. Well, there's two perspectives that one could take at least, at least 2, right, uh, from the ex ante perspective and the ex post perspective, right, um, should we take a backward looking perspective or a forward looking perspective? Right? Should the remedy be determined by looking at the facts of this particular case and deciding now that this event has already occurred, what's the best way to sort out this particular thing? That would be the expos approach. From after, right, you're you're you're, you're later in the day, you're looking back and you go, OK, what, what, what would be best to fix this particular thing? Or instead, should we consider what would be the best rule to have in place looking toward the future in affecting people's future behavior in light of what the court has ruled? That's the ex ante approach from, you know, before, now is before the future. Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Or alternatively, today is the last day of the first part of your life. Um, means the same thing, uh, one's a little bit more inspiring than the other, um, the, um, uh, but you go look at the future, right, uh, from now, we are before everything that's going to happen in the future. From that perspective, what would be optimal? Now, sometimes those answers will be the same, but not always. Sometimes they will have different consequences with respect to efficiency or justice or other things you might care about. So in the context of building encroachments, let's pick an example that is familiar to us because we just did them. All right. Um, the injunction that was issued in Pyle v. Pedrick. Has the effect exposed. of tilting any post-litigation negotiation heavily in favor of the plaintiff. At least it looks that way. Again, I have weird views about this case, but we're just going to ignore those. All right, um, uh, based on what we've seen, right, this tilts it very much in favor of the plaintiff, right, because there's been a tiny, teeny tiny encroachment, and the plaintiff can now force the defendant to engage in this enormous expense of tearing down the wall and digging out the foundation for the for the defendant's side of the property line. Good googlymoogly. All right, um, expo, this really tilts the playing field in favor of the plaintiff. This is what the court in Golden Press versus Rylands was worried about. We don't want to do that, all right, so we're not. OK, that is very much ex post analysis, right? We are looking at these particular people and figuring out, hey, what's going to happen here, right, and going, uh, that, that just seems bad, right? So we're not going to do that because we don't want to tilt the playing field there too much. Ex ante The effect of the pile courts issuing the injunction is to give very strong incentives to builders to be extremely careful about property lines when they're building, right, because they can't just shrug off. It's like, maybe we're pretty close, close enough, right? It's like, yeah, if we're over a little bit, yeah, we'll just pay some money and that'll be fine. It's like, no, if you're over a little bit, it could be really expensive. OK, so this ex ante, the pile rule, the pile judgment, has the effect of giving very strong incentives to builders to be very careful about where property lines are. Ex ante, the golden press approach does the opposite. It's like if you're over by a bit, you know, you can just pay the 55 bucks and it's not a big deal. Now whether that effect ex ante of say the pile approach is good or bad, probably depends upon what you assess the severity of the thing, the risk you're dealing with here. Right, in some cases it might be important to give really strong incentives not to mess up. If the mistakes are very expensive, right, um, and cause injuries, for example, that cannot be adequately compensated in money. Then you might want to really make sure that people are not making those mistakes that will cause those injuries you can't compensate the money, right, yeah. You might think just intuitively I'm not a torch person, but things that involve like potential personal injuries, right? People losing legs and things like that. We might want to get very, very strong incentives not to make mistakes. It's going to cost people limbs. But we don't necessarily want to give incentives to have maximum security all the time. There is a certain amount of risk that's inherent in life, and that's good, right? People have mental disorders where they get obsessive compulsive about certain things and you can get treatment for that. You can take medication for it, you can get other kinds of therapy for that in which they are hyper risk averse. A lot of people came back from Iraq. Soldiers came back from Iraq with post-traumatic stress disorder in which one of the symptoms of that is hypervigilance. So they were trained. They were in an environment in which you see a box on the road that might be an IED and provide explosive device that could kill you. And so people coming back sometimes had trouble adjusting to a world in which that wasn't a thing. They're just hyper vigilant. They see a box on the road, probably empty, but they think IED, and they're super careful about it. That does cut down on the risk of being blown up by an IED. 100% that does that, but it also keeps them from functioning in various ways that we think are generally beneficial for them, and people seek treatment for that. This is a common thing, right? People get trained to see the world in certain ways because of their background, and they might get excessively careful about stuff. We're having a big, we're not having a debate, we should have a debate, but we're just like not, um, but there's a big issue currently about what kind of safety should we have with respect to AI. AI seems like the generative AI stuff seems like potentially super duper dangerous. Somebody at one of the big AI firms, the head of safety for that, just resigned. Uh, which one was it? Anthropic, yeah, and to just resigned, like, yeah, alright, so there's some people who are working on this like, OK, we're about to end the world, um, and maybe you are, maybe you aren't. I've been seeing on social media, uh, this is genuinely scary, even if we do not have a super intelligence that could wipe things out. But that you know the main profitable use case for AI right now is scams, and so people are getting like phone calls that sound like they're from relatives that like 100% sound like their voice asking, saying, oh my gosh, we're getting some terrible things happen, need money, this kind of thing, right? It's getting to the point that you cannot rely on, oh, I'm talking to somebody that that is actually your family member. Right, um, and that's, that's not good. Right, so now like you're genuinely getting advice, right, people are saying things like you should have a pass phrase. That you're going to use with family members, an authentication passphrase, and Yeah, alright, OK, OK, that, that makes sense. I'm trying to figure out how to make that work with my Uh, 80 plus 86 year old mom, I'm kind of worried about with respect to that. Her mind still seems as of like a week ago, her mind seemed pretty good, but, uh, you know, it's when you get older, it's like you can spoof the phone number right too, easy. So it sounds like it's one of her kids or maybe her granddaughter phoning and it sounds just like her. How do you get this secure? I don't know. I'm thinking maybe, I think they have some of that's authentic, you know, like it's basically go learn spycraft stuff, but I think, uh, basically we might have a list of authentication codes. Maybe I'll give her like a list here and we go, OK, code code number 2 is like a 12 digit number or something, and I want you to read that off for me. This does not seem like an optimal way for the world to be candidly here. It's like we need to have authentication, secure authentication when you're talking to your parents. Um, this seems kind of risky. On the other hand, if we don't do this, maybe AI is going to be super valuable for doing all sorts of things, and maybe the things that it's good at doing are also the things that the good stuff it can do is also maybe the stuff that's really bad that it can do. So it seems like AI may be really, really good at identifying potential treatments for dread diseases. So it might be really good at identifying stuff that will enable us to fight cancer, say, pick a, fill in a thing, much better. That very same capability makes it much better at identifying potential biological weapons and creating those too. How do you deal with that? I don't know. Deep question. Above my pay grade. You guys are young, you're smart, you're digital natives. You can figure it out. When you do, let me know. But what's the optimal level of safety with that? What's the optimal level of safety with cars? It's not 100% safety, right? If we had 100% safety, we wouldn't have any cars on the road. What's the optimal level of safety with ways? Serious question. Waymos appear to be safer than human drivers. Um, so should we force everybody to use Waymos? I don't know, right? The optimal level of how many people did this in torts? Alright, so how many people did you have torts in the fall or the spring? Take it now. OK. Uh, in torts, you're doing there's 3, 2.5 theories of torts. There's the cost of accidents theory. There's the corrective justice theory, and the civil recourse theory. How many people are doing cost of accidents?

SPEAKER 0
Pardon? All right, all right, so, OK, well I, I have

SPEAKER 1
no idea what anyone's learning in law school anymore anyway, um, so I'm sure it's great, uh, anyway, so, uh, this is kind of, we're getting into a torque realm, right, but, uh, there's an issue about optimal safety amounts, right? So what kind of, you don't want to require people to be 100% safe because if you did, you would never leave your apartment. Um, but we do want to give people incentives to be safe enough. And so what is that? So for the Payv Pedrick gives incentives to be very careful about property lines. Is that too careful, or is that just careful enough? That's a question. Alright, open question. Right, um, courts in general seems like they probably naturally gravitate toward ex post analysis. At least my guess is, and I've not done any empirical work on this, my guess is that trial courts often will gravitate toward ex post analysis. My guess, and this is just a guess. Is that appeals courts may tend to, uh, may feel more of a pull toward ex ante analysis on things, um, but either which one's the right one, neither or both, right? You know they're both aspects of any given legal problem and it's useful to keep that in mind, right, so this is an idea that we're talking about here but it runs throughout the law, not just property law, but all the law. This was because we did encroachments. They're a good example of it. That's why I talked about it again. OK, any questions on this?

SPEAKER 2
I just wanna clarify what you sorry, I just wanna clarify what you said. You said you, you're in your estimation, you think trial courts will lean towards more ex post and then app appellate courts would lean towards the opposite, uh, ex ante.

SPEAKER 1
I'm making that up. So I'm making that up, right? So think about the dumbest AI that you've ever asked a question for and then take your level of belief for that and divide it by 2, right? Um, that's like I like, I don't know, that was just pure speculation. I shouldn't have said it. Someone's going to think, hey, some guy, OK, I'll forget

SPEAKER 2
about it. I'll forget. But the, but, but actually, no, I can't forget about, I can't forget anything you say. Um, uh, another question I had is that you mentioned earlier ex ante and ex post ex ante that favors the petition it tends to favor the petitioner or vice versa.

SPEAKER 1
OK. All right, um, so ex ante, it's just, uh, it's just different ways of looking at things. It's like, here's something broken. All right, um, I can fix it. But in fixing it, I may be making a bad precedent for the future. Um, or I could make something that's a good precedent for the future, but seems like it's kind of screwing over somebody unfairly here. What do I do in that circumstance? Sometimes the ex ante and ex post perspectives lead to the same answer, in which case, great. But sometimes they don't, and that's when it gets, OK, then you're gonna have to make a decision as to which one is more important and how you can maybe finesse that and deal with it. Ah Um, All right, so our discussion of remedies in Golden Press and in Pavi Pedrick raises the question of how is it that you can vindicate or protect your right to exclude. So you got a right to exclude. How can you get that protected? And there's basically 2.5. 2nd time I said 2.5 in the same class, kind of weird. Uh, there's basically 2.5 ways you can do this. And so let's just run through them, uh, quickly, just an overview of this. So one is criminal law. Right, there are criminal laws protecting property. You're well familiar with the criminal laws protecting personal property, right? There's all sorts of theft laws, theft is illegal. That's what there's robbery, there's burglary, there's larceny. I, I, I memorized them for the final exam in crim and then forgot about which which is which, and then I memorized it again for the bar and then forgot it again. So anyway, so I don't know they're different, I think, but uh they're, they're there, they exist, right? So you know that there's stuff for acquiring pers taking personal property without somebody's permission that can be illegal and it's criminal. You can go to jail for that. There also are criminal laws protecting real property, but it's not as prominent, so criminal trespass is a thing. Um, this is a relatively late addition to the list of common law crimes. It was added in the United States in the second half of the 19th century, so pretty late in the game. The penalties for criminal trespass are usually small misdemeanor fines. Recall in Jacques V. Steinberg Holmes, we actually had an example of this. Right, the Jacques called the sheriff when Steinberg Holmes went on their land, called the sheriff, and the sheriff came and took a look and said, yep, trespassing, and issued a $30 fine to Steinberg Holmes. Right, that's pretty typical. Small dollar misdemeanor fines. That raises the question, why even bother having this in the law in the first place? And the standard story is because the existence of criminal trespass means that if somebody's trespassing on your land, you can call the cops. And that means that when the cops come, the cops, they're collecting a check for this. They don't know you. They don't know the other person. They are not personally invested in this, and the theory is then they'll be more calm in dealing with it. They're just going to sort it out, and then there will be some sort of you can sue in civil court if you want to and you deal with it, but the cops are not going to get really emotionally involved in it. As opposed to, you can imagine in Jacques v. Steinberg Holmes where the Jacques seemed really, really into excluding Steenberg Holmes, and Steenberg Holmes, probably a bunch of guys there trying to move this thing across and they want to deliver this thing. You could have had some serious conflict going on there. It would not have been optimal. All right, um. I'm scared here. Given that people are actually paying too much attention to what I said the last time I speculated, I'm going to throw out some more speculation. I was just going to throw this out and you go, Man, just stop speculating. Just give me some rules to memorize. All right, so here we go. I will just note I'm not a historian and I don't know Crim, but that theory, that's a theory. Maybe it's right, maybe it's wrong. One interesting historical fact to me is that the, uh, so criminal trespass enters the list of common law crimes in the second half of the 19th century. Around the middle of the 19th century is when the large urban police forces, municipal police forces start getting organized as well. So the idea of like calling the cops before may not have really made so much sense. So these two things correlate, so maybe they are in fact related. That said, correlation is not. Causation, very good correlation is not causation. You can entertain yourself by going to the spurious correlations website. How many people are familiar with this? All right, good for you, right? So you go to the spurious correlations. It's called spurious correlations. You can Google it, and they will list for you things that are very closely correlated but have no relationship whatsoever. Some examples that I wrote down last night. So very close correlation between the annual US household spending on pork and the stock price of Lululemon. It it just matches and I hadn't actually been on the website in several years. They've made it spifffier now, so now they have made up, they use AI to make up explanations for why these relate. They're used in an older version of chat GPT and if you look at the prompt, it's like make it funny and so it's like most of them are kind of bad, but this one's actually, you know, making up something here. All right. Here's the AI explanation. As pork consumption rose, so did the demand for stretchy. Pants with forgiving waistbands, leading to higher profits for Lululemon. It's a classic case of bringing home the bacon and then kneading pants with extra give. Uh, Chat GPT, ladies and gentlemen, that's a Model 3.5. They've improved it somewhat since then. Um, but all right, that's, you know, bogus. Other things that correlate, let's see, I wrote this down last night. UFO sightings in Maryland correlate with liquefied petroleum gas used in Thailand. Per capita consumption of margarine correlates with the divorce rate in Maine. I found a good use case for AI, so I decided to just to test out the newer models of chat GPT. I had there's, I didn't write it down. I wrote down my other notes. Sorry. There's a correlation between popularity of the name Malika. And customer satisfaction at Macy's. Um, and so I had Chat GPT come up with like, explain that, and it was actually reasonably smart the first time. It says, well, that's a spurious correlation. Good, good for Chat GPT. Um, I said, OK, give me a fictional plausible sounding one. And then it gave me this long list of. plausible. I mean, if you look, if you think about them for a moment or two, you realize that they're bogus. But, you know, you could kind of snow somebody with doing that. Uh, it's like, OK, and also the website now not only will give you the AI generated explanation. It also has the academic paper on it. It automatically has the AI generate an academic paper based on these correlations. What's actually going on at the website, so what's actually going on at the website is that they've got he's got this massive database of various things, and then he just sends some software to take a look at these and find things that coincidentally happen to be correlated very closely. Alright, um, and then having done that, he puts it out. That is a great way to commit basically academic misconduct and also to get tenure at elite institutions. So there have been a bunch of instances people have gotten caught with this where they have basically, it's called basically I think it's, I think it's related to pea hacking, but it doesn't matter. Forget the term, uh, P is for statistical probability of uh uh randomness. Basically there have been. People have gotten caught for doing this where they say, OK, look at a bunch of data, find the correlations, and then publish a paper saying, oh look, and then a bunch of the stuff that makes the news turns out like it's kind of bogus stuff like that. Like it turned out like various nudge literature stuff, maybe this and so forth. All right, so don't do that correlation is not causation. This is my chance to just warn you of this before you write your notes. All right, so there we are. I've done my duty. There we are. All right, that concludes our discussion of criminal law in this course. Um, second thing you can get, and you're already familiar with this in part because we've talked about it a bit, we'll talk more about it, civil actions protecting real property, and you know you can sue. And there are 3 main ones trespass, ejectment, and nuisance. Trespass protects possession. You know, I bring the mobile home across your property without your permission. You sue me for trespass. I trespassed. Ejectment is similar, but it's basically I go on your property and I don't leave and I stay there. All right, so then you sue me to get me off. All right. That is what you do if you want to stop adverse possession. Somebody's adversely possessing your property, you see it in time, you bring an ejectment suit to get them ejected off the property, right? So ejectment protects not only possession but also title, protects your title. And the third thing is nuisance, which we haven't talked about yet, but it basically protects your use of the property, not possession, not title, no new use. We'll talk about use and nuisance later on. All right, those are the two main ones, and then this is the half one. The half one is the one that we have cases on self-help. All right, forget the law. Just step in and take care of it yourself. We have seen concerns about self-help already in Baker versus Howard County Hunt when Baker shot the dogs. The question is like, yeah, is that allowed? And the court was, well, not really, but it's not bad enough that we're going to keep you from getting injunctive relief. But still not good. All right, so there's concerns about self-help. In general, somebody who already possesses. Real property, right, um. Legitimately so, they're already in possession of it, is entitled to use reasonable force to prevent or terminate a trespass. So if you already possess the real property, you can use reasonable force to prevent a trespass or to terminate it. So for example, if you're in a club and you're getting too rowdy, uh, they can ask you to leave, and if you don't leave, the bouncer can grab you and shove you out of the club, right? That's self-help, using physical force, reasonable force, that's fine. You can do that. You're not allowed to use lethal force. Lethal force is never reasonable to terminate a trespass, and you're also not allowed to use a thing. Tell me you've got to have done this in torts, or at least you will, right? Spring guns. Spring guns. No. All right, so Ivy League torts is like a whole different world here now. OK. It's a spring guns like it's like it only shows up in torque classes is the thing. So a spring gun is where you got this basically this automatic gun, right? So it's loaded, you got a spring hooked up to it. So if somebody opens the door, like cracks open your garage door, then it triggers the spring and boom, the gun shoots you. All right, Protecting your property there, it's basically like a kind of like a landmine, kind of like a Claymore, except a little bit more targeted, not allowed to do that. Can't do that. All right, all right, so that's that's for somebody who already possesses real property. But what if the owner, the true owner who's entitled to the possession, doesn't currently have possession? They are out of possession, they're entitled to possession, but they're out of possession. Alright, what are the rules then? Can they use self-help? If so, how much? That is the two cases that we have here. Those are the two cases we have here. So the first of them is Byrd v. Wiley, Supreme Court of Minnesota, 1978, page 357. Plaintiff Berg was a tenant who had a restaurant, was located in a building leased from the defendant Wiley. The lease had various requirements that it imposed on the tenant. Berg had breached them. Alright, so breach of the lease, right, um, the lease had a clause saying that if the tenant breached, then the landlord had the option of taking possession back. The restaurant had closed, maybe temporarily for repair, maybe permanently. It's unclear on the record. Um, the landlord came by when Berg was present. And tried to change the locks, but Berg refused to relinquish possession. Wiley then left. Later came back to try again after Berg was gone. Coming back the second time, brought a cop. I brought a police officer. You can view that in one of two ways. Maybe brought the cop to intimidate Berg, maybe brought the cop just to make sure that, you know, nothing illegal happened, right? Just keep everything calm. You pick your favorite story. But anyway, brought a cop, but Berg wasn't there. It's like there's nobody there. It's just like it's just empty. It's just quiet. Couldn't be more quiet. Changes the locks, re-lets out the place to somebody else. Berg then sues. Right. Was Wiley's the issue is was Wiley's use of self-help, that's self-help, right? They went there and just physically changed the locks. They did the thing. No court order, nothing. They just went and did it themselves. Was that illegal? And the trial court says that it was illegal and the appeals court here affirms, so the tenant wins. Um, the court says there's two issues, one of which I'll just mention by way of preview because we'll talk about this question in general more later, but not now, and that issue is the first issue is was there sufficient evidence that the tenant hadn't abandoned the property? Turns out there are some circumstances you can abandon property, which means relinquishing your property rights. And if you do, then you don't have any property rights in it anymore. So there's a question here as to whether the tenant, because the place was closed, had the tenant relinquished his property rights, and if so, then wouldn't have any basis to sue. But the court says no they didn't. All right, we'll talk about abandonment more later. So, given that, uh. The tenant had some rights here. Was the defendants changing the locks. Unlawful, as a matter of law. As a matter of law, it means just the judge can decide it himself or herself without sending it to a jury. And the court says yes and awards damages to the tenant. And it does so. It says we could have done this. The court says we could have gotten here two ways. We could have done it under the traditional common law, and we could have done it under a new rule that we are stating today. So the court says under the traditional common law, which we'll discuss more in a moment, given the particular facts of this case, the common law rule would have allowed self-help. Common law rule allowed self-help under some circumstances, but those circumstances don't apply here, so self-help is not allowed. Right, under the traditional common law rule. But That doesn't matter, the court says, because it is changing the law. It is today declaring that it is changing the law, rejecting the common law rule, and holding that self-help is never allowed. And the court says this is not unfair to the defendant because the defendant would have lost anyway under the old common law rule. I believe I have mentioned before that this is a strategy the courts will often do if you want to change the law on something. You wait until you have a case in which even under the original rule, the plaintiff or the defendant, whatever, you know, the relevant party would have lost, so that way it's not unfair to change things for them, change the law there that is looking, that is combining both the ex post and the ex ante perspectives, right? Ex ante, the court thinks it's really good if we have a different rule, so we want to change the rule. Ex post that would seem to be pretty bad, right, and people relied on the existing rule and now they're going to court and they expect to win and now they lose because, whoa, we just changed the rules. That seems bad. Exposed. But if it turns out you would have lost under the old rule anyway, ex post, not a problem. So we've avoided a situation in which the ex post and ex ante perspectives diverge. We keep them in line and we're all good. OK, the common law rule, the court said. Was that self-help would be permissible if two of the following things were true. One, the landlord was entitled to possession, and the means of re-entry were peaceable. Now here was the landlord entitled to possession? It seems fairly clear the landlord was. The tenant had breached the lease. The lease said if there's a breach, the landlord could could retake. So it looks like, OK, one is satisfied. The real action is with respect to two. The means of re-entry was peaceable, and there's a dispute over whether that's the case. The defendant argues that changing the locks when the tenant isn't around is peaceable. But the court says no, not peaceable. Here, the court said there was a history of keen animosity between the parties. They hated each other's guts. In fact, if you look at the litigation history on this case, the litigation had been going on for years. They had been suing each other for years. 3 years earlier, there had been another Wisconsin Supreme Court case in this, or is it Minnesota? I'm in. I always confuse Wisconsin. For reasons that I do not understand, I grew up, I'm a bicoastal guy, right? My geography in the Midwest is bad. That's a Minnesota case. There had been an earlier Minnesota, 3 years earlier, there had been a Minnesota Supreme Court decision in this litigation. They've been going at it for years, so they hated each other's guts. And the court says, oh, given that, um, uh, violence might well have ensued. In effect, what the court's saying is the risk of violence being sufficiently high is taken to constitute the re-entries of not being peaceable. Now that arguably is shifting the meaning of peaceable maybe so that the court can say, hey, you would have lost under the common law rule, original common law rule, might think that peaceable means, well, you know, it was peaceful, and this could not have been more peaceful, right, the actual thing. Um, the court rejected the common law rule that, having said the common law, right, so that's the common law analysis, and the court rejects it on policy grounds. One thing the court says is that there's little need for self-help because Minnesota Minnesota law gives quick remedies to landlords who need to dispossess tenants who are entitled to dispossess tenants and need to kick them out. So landlord could just go to court and get a quick remedy and that'll take care of that. Um, also, the court says there would be perverse incentives if the presence of actual violence ended up being determinative of the ability of self-help. In other words, whether self-help was allowed, if it turned, if the rule was that whether self-help was allowed depended upon whether there was actual violence, then we've got bad incentives for the future. What's the bad incentive? So if the rules that, then what do you do as a tenant?

SPEAKER 2
Quick question, can you just repeat the, the rule again?

SPEAKER 1
All right, so the actual, so the common law rule is. Self-help is allowed if landlord's entitled to retake possession, and 2, the means of re-entry, taking possession are peaceable. Alright, the court then interprets peaceable as meaning not just that there is no actual confrontation, no actual violence, but that there's not any sufficiently high risk of it too. Put it another way, non-peaceable means actual violence or a sufficiently high risk of violence would be non-peaceable. Same thing said two different ways. All right, suppose the rule were the opposite. So suppose we didn't have the court's interpretation of this. So suppose we said no, the only thing that would be not peaceable and therefore would make self-help not available. Is if there was actual violence. What then would be the incentives for the Uh, for the tenant This way you seem to indicate, like you were like, you gave facial expressions indicating you were thinking. Does this mean you want to say something? Yes, you I don't cold call, so you can say no and I'll just move on. Uh, no, I was just gonna say they would, they

SPEAKER 3
would have an incentive to like spark a confrontation and or to pick a fight with the landlord to make it not peaceable. Yes, exactly, right.

SPEAKER 1
You got an incentive, right? If the rule is they could take your property, uh, unless you fight them, well, I mean, what do you do? You fight them, right? Throw a punch, right? That's the law. That doesn't make much sense. That's not the the court says that, that doesn't make sense, so we don't want to do that. All right, um, tenants would have an incentive to just lurk around all the time to see if the landlord was coming behind and then cause violence if they did. All right, note again that we have ex ante perspective being used here, right? Worried about what the incentives would be if you interpreted the peaceable requirement a different way. Ex ante would have bad incentives for people. Ex post in this case, there was no confrontation. There was no violence, could not have been more quiet. So ex post seems fine, but the court's worried that ex ante would be really bad if you called that peaceable. So the court then says that it is now adopting for Minnesota the modern unquote trend. In holding that self-help is never available to dispossess a tenant, there is an inherent potential for violence whenever a landlord attempts to dispossess a tenant. The court says So if you wanna dispossess a tenant, you gotta go to, go to court, get a court order, allow the legal system to deal with it. Maybe a sheriff comes by then to execute, uh, on an eviction order or something. Now, one thing to note, just a heads up about this case, but also about casebooks in general in law school, this is what the court says is the modern trend, so you probably wrote down modern trend. OK, this case was decided circa 1978. So the modern trend circa 1978 is way before your time. Not only were you not born, your parents probably were born, but they had not met, right? Uh, this is how modern is this? I don't know, right? Uh, we don't care because in law school, right, the law that you're governed by on an exam is the law of the casebook, and, uh, anything that's in there, whether it's a 17th century case or whether it's a case decided yesterday, it's all the same, doesn't matter. We don't care. England, the United States, doesn't matter, we don't care. It's all the same, um, but just be aware of that potential issue there. Um, other courts more recently have held that self-help is allowed. For landlords in commercial landlord tenant disputes, I think the thinking being if there's less likelihood of actual violence if you're dispossessing somebody from a business location because it's not personal, it's just business as opposed to kicking somebody out of their home. Right, people are really protective of their homes for obvious reasons. Now that said, Berg v. Wiley was about a restaurant that that was a commercial lease. That wasn't a residential lease. So the Minnesota court clearly thought that that should apply to commercial leases just as much as residential ones, but other jurisdictions more recently have disagreed on that. All right, any questions on that? Yeah.

SPEAKER 4
Didn't they, didn't the court go overboard with not allowing self help altogether? Like surely they could have split it and said, you know, no self help if they, if the, the tenant is anywhere in the vicinity and they could cut it off with some amount, whatever arbitrary number that they have like a certain amount of feet or whatever it is, but if they're absolutely nowhere to be found, then why not use self help? It just seems all right, so good question like, uh,

SPEAKER 1
maybe, and uh we'll actually get back to that, uh, later, like is it possible like maybe they could add some other intermediate rule rather than this. Um, I don't know. I can't, like I, I, uh, I was, I was alive, uh, when this case was decided, but I was very young, uh, so, uh, I was not clerking on the on the Minnesota Supreme Court. So I don't know, but one thing you could say, right, the one natural concern would be how administrable is that, right? Um, how do you actually demonstrate where the people are. Remember this is 1978 today. You've got a little thing like everybody's wearing an ankle bracelet now, right? We just call them iPhones or Google Pixels or whatever, Pixels, right? It's just tracking your location all the time. There was recently somebody like ICE or somebody, uh, the federal government was like claiming that somebody was up to no good because they had their phone off. And so therefore, oh, clearly we can't track what the where, where they were during this period of time. Clearly they were up to no good. Um, my phone is in airplane mode almost all the time, so I don't know. Does this mean that I, I can they track that? I don't think great for protecting your battery. Seriously, it's like I have to charge my phone like only like once every 3 days or something like it's uh it's great. Um, just keep it in airplane mode until you need it. Also that keeps you off the social media stuff and you're just like, oh, OK, it's uh there you are. Um, the, um, uh, but you didn't have that back in 1978, right? So it's going to be really hard to know where these people are and at the end of the day it's just much more administrable to say you just can't do it, period. Um OK, our other, our companion case to this is Williams versus Ford Motor Credit Company. Eighth Circuit case from 1982, page 364. Right, this is a case in which we have a couple of people, a couple of young people I'm guessing, uh, made two big mistakes. All right. Kathy, uh, Kathy Williams and David Williams. Mistake number one is they got married. Mistake number 2 is that they bought a Ford Mustang on credit in the 1970s. Buying the car on credit is not optimal, but often you often do it. Buying an American car in the 1970s, not a good idea. Those cars were junk. Um, and the year 1976 Ford Mustang is generally considered by Mustang aficionados to be one of the worst Mustangs ever built, and that's saying something. Those American cars were terrible. The car I learned to drive in and basically was allowed to use as a kid was a 1976 Buick Century. I still have nightmares about that thing. That thing is just not good. OK, so they bought the Ford Mustang on credit. They later divorced. I don't know if the decision to purchase the Mustang played a role in the divorce. Money conflicts are a common cause of friction amongst young couples. Also, I'm guessing the Ford Mustang may not have been a model car that both spouses were equally enthusiastic about, um, so that might have led to some tension. Anyway, they buy the car on credit. The divorce happened, they get divorced, and uh so then you go to divorce court and now you got to separate the assets, right, because you're, you got uh you got a division of this because they're no longer going to be together. Um, and so how does the court, uh, the divorce court handle the car? What was the, what was the resolution they did with the car? Yeah I'm his bets.

SPEAKER 5
Um, the divorce court granted Kathy title to the car and required David to continue to make payments, um, to the Ford Motor Credit Company for 18 months.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, OK, so the deal is they basically split it 50/50. She gets the car, he gets the car payments, you know, so, um, uh, that's the deal and. In a shocking development, um. David eventually stopped making payments on the car that he couldn't use but had been given to his ex-wife, whom he may at this point well now hate, so he stopped making payments. Ford Motor Credit Company comes over and says, Hey, uh, there are payments due on this car. You're not making payments. You're going to pay us the money now? No, OK, then we're going to repossess that. And David's like, cool. Fine by me. And so off they go. All right, so the repo team goes over to Kathy Williams' place at 4:30 a.m. to do the repo. This is actually very normal. Uh, if you're doing a repo, you want to go in at a time that ideally the people, if they're ideally. Not, but often you can't do that. So if they are home, hopefully they're asleep. So you go in there, you grab the thing and you get out, get in fast, get out fast before they have time to like wake up and realize what's going on, and you're just gone because you're not paid extra for anything else, right? You're just paid to get the car. Oh, they do this, but she woke up, according to the she's living in a house trailer. I've never lived in one, but the sense I get is that the walls are pretty thin in those, so sound probably travels pretty well through them. So she hears what's going on outside and she goes out to talk to them. And according to the facts in the record, the interaction was polite, and the repo folks leave with the car and then she files a police report for a stolen car and then later sues. Now if we were applying the Berg Court's analysis to this case, pretty obvious what the outcome would be, right? Uh, Williams would win. The repo would be impermissible since the Berg Court held that self-help is never allowed because of the risk of violence. But the court here rules the opposite in this case, different jurisdiction, different set of facts, rules the opposite. All right, uh, Williams loses, the creditors win. Repo is permissible. The court's reasoning is as follows The UCC Uniform Commercial Code allows repossession without judicial process, so you don't have to go to court and get a court order, right? You can just do the repo. If this can be done without breach of the peace. Sounds an awful lot like peaceable, right, if this can be done without breach of the peace. In this case, the court said there was no incident that might have provoked violence. Kathy Williams raised no objection during the repossession. All right, so it was fine. This looks like expost analysis here, right? This is an example of expost analysis. So look at what happened. There's no fight, you didn't object. Everything was peaceful. There we go. Right, now. This court and the Berg court seem to be disagreeing pretty fundamentally about the peaceableness of repossessions, right? In this case, in Williams, there actually is confrontation. But the court says the repo is peaceable. In Berg, there was no confrontation, and the court said it was not peaceable. They have two fundamentally different views of what constitutes peaceable. Right, the descent. Is obviously disagreeing, right? Um, and they say dissent says, look, the facts here might have led to violence. This sounds more Berg v. Wiley-ish, and this might be more ex ante analysis, right, not only at what actually happened, but of what could have happened like looking forward in these sorts of situations might have led to violence and the dissent says at any rate the jury should have been allowed to decide that the rule the dissent says should be that the repo person should be required to retreat, in other words, break off the repo, not not retake. Um, when both detection occurs and confrontation ensues. So when Kathy Williams heard what was going on outside and decided to go out and confront them about it, that should have forced the repo people to just say, OK, got to leave and just leave the car behind. Um, This might seem at first glance to be kind of like the Pyle versus Golden Press situation where you have two courts presented with basically the same facts reaching opposite conclusions and looking maybe kind of weird in that way, but note that there's at least one major difference. Between the facts in Berg and the facts in Williams, in Berg, the property in question was real property, dirt and buildings, building in this case. In Williams, the property in question was personal property, a car for repossession of personal property. Most courts agree with Williams, the Williams majority, and allow self-help. Today repossession is common. Repo man or repo woman is an actual job title, a job you can have. This can become kind of spectacular if the thing being repossessed is pretty big, um, and sometimes very valuable. There was on the Discovery Channel, uh, for a few years, some years ago, a program called Airplane Repo, in which you're not repossessing like these little Cessnas. Be repossessing like a Boeing 737 or an Airbus 8300 in which you get these companies or sometimes countries for their national airlines as a matter of pride have borrowed a bunch of money to buy these super expensive planes. They fall behind the payments and so they have somebody to repossess them and so these repo folks go in there. And they sneak into the airport and they grab the plane and fuel it up and fly it away. If that's not impressive enough to you, if that seems too small ball, you also can get repossession of ships. You can get an entire ship being grabbed. There was an article in the New York Times about that a decade ago in which had an interesting quote in it about ship repossession people. All the repo men said they abide by certain self-imposed rules. No violence or weapons. Better, they said, to hire street youths for lookouts, bar owners for diversions, and prostitutes to talk their way on board to spy unquote. OK, so one of the interesting things about this, right, is that these repo people have a rule for themselves, no violence. They don't want confrontation and violence. This makes sense because they're just paid for the rebound. They're paid to get the ship. They don't get paid extra if somebody gets shot. Right, that's just pure loss to them. So they have a strong incentive to just do it in a way that doesn't get them shot, uh, and just enables them to take the thing. And that may raise the question of whether the Berg court went too far, right, um, in holding that self-help repossession is never peaceable, and that's never allowed because maybe the people doing the repossession already have a strong incentive to avoid actual violence. They're willing to take a bit of a risk of violence, but maybe they're wanting, yeah, they have a strong incentives to avoid actual violence. Now that said, I want to push back on that. There is another big distinction between what I just described here and what happens in Berg v. Wiley. What I described here involves professional repo people. Their job is just to do repo, right? They don't actually care about the ship or the people paying them. It's just a job to them. Berg v. Wiley, not so. It's the actual landlord who is doing the repossession, um, and there the actual landlord may be more emotionally involved in this situation than a dispassionate repo person is. Rule for lawyers, right? Any lawyer who represents himself or herself in a dispute has a fool for a client, right. Lawyers who represent themselves have fools for clients. You never do that. Why? Because you're too close to it. You're emotionally tied up in a way that will not lead you to make optimal decisions. You're much better off just hiring somebody else to handle your case and let them do it because they are going to be more clear-eyed about things. OK, any questions so far on Williams? Yeah.

SPEAKER 6
Um, I have a sort of tangential question. How does this work with things like towing where it's my, so I've had my car towed before. I felt very angry. Um, it's was my personal property on someone else's like a parking spot was real property. So how does the kind of interaction there go because it feels like it would be a high likelihood of violence if you're towing someone else's car off of your property, but then am I allowed to go. And repossess my car from the towing lot.

SPEAKER 1
All right, so let's, let's divide that into two different bits, right? So the first bit and the second bit. So the first bit temporarily, right? First bit is you're parked in some lot and it gets towed. I don't know the circumstances of this, but let's assume, let's just hypothetical, right? Assume that you're parked there and you've parked longer than whatever you paid for or whatever it is, and so they're going to tow you off the lot, right? There, you at that point are trespassing on their real property, their parking lot. They have a right to use self-help, reasonable force to terminate the trespass, which they do when they bring the tow truck in and they tow you off. OK, now the car is in the lot. The, uh, you know, the, the tow company's lot. Um, at that point, if you try to use self-help to repossess it, then you're gonna have to go on the lot, almost certainly without permissions, and now you're trespassing. Um, whether you have a right to the car or not, if you could like. Hire a helicopter. The helicopter was like a a sort of claw on a sling-like thing. And so at no point do you ever touch the real property, but you use the claw to then lift the thing up, probably violating all sorts of FAA regulations, but you're doing that, but we'll set that aside. Um, would that be OK? I don't know. I don't actually have because there's there's a thing we'll talk more about this. Off and on in other circumstances. I think I'm a lean. A lien is when somebody, it is a a limited property interest that person A has in person B's property. All right. Um, and one common example of a lien is a thing called a mechanic's lien. And I know very little, and I'm about to tell you all I know about this, which is very little, so I got like 2 sentences' worth of knowledge on this. All right, so a mechanic's lien is a thing that arises when you take your car to the shop to get fixed, and they fix it and you owe them money for that. If you don't pay them, they've got a lien in your car that will basically secure the amount of money that they basically advanced you on a no interest loan and credit by fixing the car before you were paid upfront. And so that can then allow them to hang on to the car and then potentially typically the way liens are dealt with is if you don't pay then they can sell the thing that you have a lien on, collect what they're owed, and then you get the rest. All right, so there may be in the towing situation, I don't know, in the towing situation. Maybe there was some sort of lien created there. I might be completely off on that, um. It probably depends on what the basic contract is between you and the lot where you parked. That's gonna govern those, and I don't know what the rules are because I haven't seen that. All right, that's 75% solid legal knowledge, 25% mind making things up that try to sound fairly plausible in order to address a situation that I really don't know the answer on. All right, does that, is that clear enough at least? Yes, thank you. I'm not sure if you should be thanking me or maybe cursing me. I don't know. I don't know the first half of the analysis is 100% solid. What happens when when the car is taking the towing lot, I don't know. I've never owned a car, never owned a house, never owned a car. I've missed out on all these things. Sometimes I feel like I'm 12 years old and just about ready to grow up, but grew old before I grew up. That's, that's gonna be on my tombstone. All right, um. All right, let's, a perfect time to take a break. Let's take a break on that, uh, upbeat note. Uh, when we come back, we will, uh, talk about some exceptions to the right to exclude. Give me just a second here.

SPEAKER 0
All right.

SPEAKER 7
Yeah, I said I apologize for laughing earlier because I, I apologize for smiling and laughing earlier because the sun is like blasting. No worries, no worries. I was very far off guard. I was like, wow, I sit there every day like the same time, why is it like all of a sudden I feel. Yeah, no worries, thanks for letting me know.

SPEAKER 0
Um, Professor, just to clarify, like, in case. If her wife actually tried to like fight the company she was lost. No, there that was nothing. OK, so yeah, so she she actually. Guy, but that's like too bad because now we're actually pretty.

SPEAKER 1
Right then, what the incentive.

SPEAKER 0
All right, there's an issue. Yeah. I like it, Williams is still. again. Based on his reasoning. A social class. W I. I was gonna eat it. Thank Yeah, I may not agree with it, but at

SPEAKER 1
least makes sense.

SPEAKER 0
R Yeah, I guess maybe the court thinks like, oh sure, like you might wanna get. is And when, when it's personal. Yeah. I'm I I We. The person has a lot. I and. On your driveway.

SPEAKER 1
What's this Uh.

SPEAKER 0
Oh And it does it, does it matter? Business complex ones. Good Thank you. Uh-huh. Yeah Alright guys, let's lock in.

SPEAKER 2
Let's lock in for class folks. Let's lock in for class.

SPEAKER 1
One final thing I probably might be helpful to say about Bergin Williams. Why does the fact that, uh, so Berg is about a real property repossession, Williams is about a personal property repossession, so what? Why is that a difference that makes a difference maybe here? I think there's a standard story that can be told for why it is that it may in fact make sense to have more. Generous rules, easier to satisfy rules for repossession of personal property than for real property. Why maybe both of these cases might kind of make sense in their conclusions, and that has to do with the fact that you may recall several classes ago I asked you what term you liked for personal property, chattels, movables, personal property, and you like personal property, so we're using that. But a useful traditional term for them is movables. One thing about real property is it doesn't go anywhere. Alright, uh, personal property like cars do. So suppose that the rule was you can't do a repossession of real property. What does that mean? Well, then you got to go to court and the court says in Burke, well, Minnesota gives you quick remedies and so it's fine. It's not so bad. Um, but what if the rule is you can't do a repossession of uh. Personal property, uh, unless it's like 100%, you know. Uh, uh, why you just couldn't do it. You couldn't do it without going to court. Well, what might happen then? You file a suit in court and then the car mysteriously disappears from the parking lot or from the driveway. It's now somewhere else. Oh gee, I don't know where. Maybe it's in a barn somewhere. Maybe it's in another state. Maybe it's 12 blocks over. I don't know. How are you going to find it? Right, that's a real concern, uh, for movable property, the risk of it going missing, wink wink, um, is. Non-trivial, but for real property, that's not the case, right? The family affair restaurant is not moving anywhere. It's gonna be there, uh, when the court issues its ruling, and you can rely on that. Right, so that's a fundamental difference between movables, personal property, and real property, which might account for the different rules that are used for repossession in each case. All right, so now we're going to shift gears a little bit. We've established ownership of property and we've established, uh, one of the things you get with ownership of property is a right to exclude, um, and we've established there's various ways that you can vindicate your right to exclude, including sometimes using self-help. Um, and that then raises the question of, uh, how far does that go? And this is the point of the course in which law professors traditionally like to make fun of William Blackstone, which is unfair. Uh, William Blackstone wrote commentaries on the Law of England, one of the most important works of Anglo-American legal literature ever. I have not read it. I've read bits of it, and much to my dismay when reading bits of it, I realized it's actually quite good, the bits that I read, and therefore I now feel bad that I've not read all of it. So it's a very famous work cited in older cases, towering figure in the law. I think there may even be a bust of Blackstone somewhere in this building. I think maybe somewhere. I don't know. I've seen it. I might be I might be getting this place confused with some other law school. I'm not sure. Uh, actually it was George Mason. I don't know anyway, um, the. Uh, Blackstone talks about property at some length, and then he says something which is always quoted so that we can say, ha ha, you're wrong, but Blackstone didn't actually mean it in the way that it's. It sounds, uh, so here's what Blackstone says. That the right of property is sole and despotic dominion in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe. So property is sole and despotic dominion. You are an absolute monarch. Over your property in total exclusion of anybody else's rights in the universe. Not in England, not on planet Earth, not in the solar system, not in the Milky Way, the entire universe. Your rights are good against Yoda. Alright, uh, alright, and so now property professor goes, ha ha, that's not right. There are many exceptions to the right to exclude Blackstone knew that he talks about all this stuff at length, alright, um, the, uh, but it's useful, it's useful to mention this as one view, the extreme view that is not true, right? You have a strong right to exclude, but it is not. Entirely unqualified. There are a bunch of exceptions to the right to exclude, and we are going to work through a bunch of them now. One common theme in many of these exceptions, I think, is that the stakes are high. Recognizing a right to exclude in such circumstances is just deemed to be too burdensome on society. Henry Smith of Merrill Smith and Brady fame is it's not really in the casebook, but in a paper he wrote, draws a useful distinction, I think, between exclusion and governance. So if you have valuable resources, it's a question of how do you actually determine what is to be done with the resources? What's the optimal way of handling that? And Smith says property law, American law of property, largely does that through an exclusion regime. Basically it allocates rights to these valuable resources to various people, and they have a right to exclude others from them, and then they can decide what to do with respect to that, and that works pretty well most of the time. But sometimes the stakes get really high. The stakes for society get really high, and when that happens, then the law shifts from an exclusion regime to a governance regime, and governance means basically the state steps in and says this is what you're going to do. Or this is what you're not going to do. You can't do that. Must do this. All right, so one way of looking at these exceptions to the right to exclude is that sometimes the stakes get high enough that we decide to switch toward a governance regime where the state's just going to say this is permitted or this is not. And one of the classic examples of this is the necessity exception. The right to exclude people from committing trespass has an exception that is a carve out for people who are acting or are entering your land without your permission under circumstances of necessity. This is Ploofy Putnam. Do you do ploof in torts. Vincent versus Lake Erie, does that ring a bell? No, OK, well, so this will be new to you. That's good. All right, it's better not to be preempted, I think, by the torts prof, uh, here. Who do you have for torts? OK, I don't, uh, not familiar, alright, um. I'm not a torts guy, right? Like I know like 5 people in torts, and that's it. And so if it's on the list of 5, I have no idea. So it's probably, you know, somebody who get the Nobel Prize in torts. They could create a Nobel Prize in torts, give a Nobel Prize in torts, and I would be utterly oblivious to the existence of that. So also a gold medal in torts. So I don't know, probably fantastic. Uh, all right. So, we have this case, Ploy Putnam. Supreme Court of Vermont 1908, page 369. Henry Putnam owns an island on Lake Champlain with a dock attached to it. Sylvester Plouff and his family, his wife, his two minor children were sailing on the lake in a loaded sloop. A sloop is a one-masted sailing vessel, has one mast. They vary in size. According to the court, a sudden and violent tempest arose. This put the sloop, its cargo, and its passengers in great danger of destruction. As a result, the police were compelled to moor the sloop to Putnam's dock to avoid destruction in the storm. Putnam's servant. Unmoors the vessel. The winds then drove the sloop aground. The sloop and the cargo were destroyed. The passengers were cast into the lake and then washed ashore. Injured as a result, they sue. The loofs claim both trespass by the servant in unmooring the sloop, you're touching our sloop or our ropes and doing that. You can't do that. And trespass of the case, which is an old fashioned catch-all tort. Basically the assertion was that that Putnam, Putnam's agent, the servant, Putnam, had a duty to permit the loofs to moor their sloop at his dock during the storm. Putnam demurred. I demur doesn't really exist, doesn't exist in the federal rules anymore. Probably doesn't exist in the New York rules of civil practice, but I don't really know them. I forgot those too after I studied for the bar, but you're familiar with the basic idea of a demur. It's a 12b6 motion in the federal rules, right? Failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted. The basic idea is you're saying, given all the facts. Doesn't matter. You have that just doesn't amount to a legal violation, right? So Putnam demurs and uh the court rejects the demur. So the police win this round. They get to continue with their case. The reasoning the court says is that the basic rule is that necessity will justify what otherwise will be a trespass. And it gives some examples of this rule in action. A sudden obstacle that it falls onto a highway and a traveler may have to swerve to avoid it and go onto somebody's property in doing so. You're allowed to do that, right? You're driving along and suddenly a tree blown over by the wind suddenly collapses in front of you. You're allowed to swerve to avoid it, even if that takes you onto somebody's land. Or you can trespass. We'll do what otherwise would be a trespass to an unauthorized entry in order to avoid loss of goods to fire or to water. So in a flood or a fire, you can go onto somebody's land. Maybe I'm not sure what they have in mind there, maybe to go onto the land that's threatened by the fire or the flood, or maybe if your land, your stuff is being threatened by the fire or the flood, go onto the land in order to deposit it there to be safe until the fire or the flood has passed on. Or to save a boat that had been driven ashore and was in danger of washing away and being destroyed. All right, so you can go onto somebody else's land, somebody else's beach to rescue the boat. And the court then says the necessity doctrine applies with special force to preservation of human life. Unquote. Alright, so it's not limited to preservation of human life, but it's especially powerful when somebody's life is at stake. So There's a necessity exception. Now who ultimately wins the case? Well, we just have a motion for a demur, which is denied, which means the thing goes ahead. That doesn't tell us who wins. It's going to end up depending on what the lower court finds the facts to be. The court here says, quote, It is certain that the rule suggested cannot be held applicable applicable, excuse me, irrespective of circumstances. So it's circumstance dependent. Whether necessity vindicates the entry or not will depend on the circumstances. The following year, the trial court on remand ruled in favor of the loofs, awarded $650 in damages. Adjust that for inflation in today's money, it's about $24,000 which to me doesn't seem like all that much for your boat's been destroyed and your cargo's been lost and you've been thrown in the water, but I don't know, maybe to you it seems like a lot. I don't know. I mean not a lot, but I don't know. Anyway, that was what the award was. OK, an issue that may be occurring to you now. Suppose that A owns some land. B enters the land without permission under necessity. He is entitled to do that. In so doing, damages A's land. Who has to pay for the damage? That is Vincent versus Lake Erie, a famous case. Minnesota Supreme Court, second occurrence of Minnesota in today's class, 1910. The setup for that is very similar to Plu v. Putnam. We have a boat that is moored to a dock. In this case, it had already been moored to the dock, and then the storm arose and The owner of the dock said, get the boat off, and the owner of the boat says, No, look at this storm, not going to. Keeps the boat there. The boat then bashes into the dock because of the storm. During the storm, and then there's a lawsuit, and the boat, the whole thing is the boat was allowed. You could moor the boat to the dock. That was fine even though ordinarily you couldn't, but in this case because of the storm you could. But the boat owner owed compensation for the damage that was caused to the dock as a result. Um So you have a privilege to enter under necessity, but it's sometimes referred to as old fashioned language that you occasionally see an incomplete privilege. If you enter and cause damage, you got to pay for it. Um, all right, any questions on that? Straightforward doctrinal bit here, uh, not to my eye the most interesting part of this case, so I will say some other things that are interesting about it, to me at least. And since you're in this class, I guess, and, well, I guess you can leave, so I guess it doesn't have to be interesting to you, but what else are you gonna do for the next 15 minutes? Um, probably something more interesting, but hey, we're here, so let's do it. So why did Putnam's servant cut the sloop loose? Well, you might think that that was to save the dock, which would kind of make sense. Compare Vincent versus Lake Erie. But there's a law review article by Joan Vogel which now appears, at least bits of it appear in the notes, uh, in this edition of the casebook. It was added in like 2nd or 3rd edition, um, that, uh, gives some unreported background to this case. So Joan Vogel actually managed to find a bunch of the. Legal documents aside from the reported decision and found out a lot more information about what was happening here. So, uh, one thing that you found out was some facts about the blues. The police were a poor, landless family. They worked on their boat. They also lived on their boat. They made money by using their boats to transport goods such as firewood from place to place. According to Vogel, the loos were well known and disliked unquote by the local residents. They were known as the pirates unquote of Lake Champlain. They were often accused of robbing vacation homes on the lake, and when local residents saw the loofs in the area, they would go on alert, and sometimes they would even use guns to scare them off. Alright, uh, so it's possible that Putnam's caretaker untied the loof's boat because he knew them and was aware of their reputation as thieves. Right. Just, uh, not just because the police didn't have permission, right? Perhaps he feared what they would do. Like he might have been alone on that island and there were 4 of them on the boat and only 1 of him there. He's a caretaker replacement. Maybe there's a bunch of valuable goods there. He's worried about that being stolen. Maybe he was worried about that. And, you know, that might seem reasonable. Uh, should you be required to allow thieves onto your property? No, all right, I think there's, I think that might have been part of the premise for the old Humphrey Bogart film, Key Largo. Anyone here seen Key Largo? It's been a long time since I saw Key Largo. I believe that's a film where Bogie met Lauren Bacall. Um, uh, anyway, it's a classic. I think that might be, but there's a storm and there's a blaze and like there's some folks there and then some gangsters are also in the place and so things get interesting. Um. All right, so that might, you know, that might explain it. Um, but there's some other interesting social context going on here too that's worth noting. The neighborhood, and this is again, I owe this to uh Joan Vogel's very interesting paper, um, the neighborhood around Lake Champlain had been changing in the late 19th and early 20th century, this is when this case is decided. Um, basically there is increased tourism and vacation homes coming in there. Effectively what we would call today gentrification of the lakefront area. Um, this Vogel says, quote, made poorer Vermonters unwelcome in places where they may have worked for centuries, unquote. Meanwhile, there is persisting prejudice against French Canadians who had been emigrating to the northeast United States, right, that's up near Quebec, and they're coming in and don't like them. They speak that funny language and they're not Americans, so there's persistent prejudice against French Canadians coming in. Putnam was a millionaire and a millionaire today doesn't mean anything because of inflation, but adjust that for inflation, that means somebody worth like let's say $50 million.50 $60 million decimillionaire I guess you would say today, and was from a prominent Vermont family. So this guy is sort of Vermont aristocracy, very wealthy, owned an island. The loofs were the opposite. About a decade later, in the 1920s, they were the subject of a eugenics survey. I'm guessing it was the eugenics survey of Vermont, um, which, and I'm quoting Vogel here, uh, was designed to illustrate the costs of allowing degenerate families to reproduce, and the degenerate families there Vogel is quoting from the statute that's creating the survey here. All right, uh, so I should say something about eugenics because we don't talk about it as much as we should, um, and we don't talk about it in law school as much as we should, um, so eugenics was a very prominent social movement at the time. The early 20th century, right thinking progressive individuals, well educated, liked eugenics, made sense. Darwin had done his thing, you know, a few decades earlier, and we know that genetics now affect things. And so we like progress. We're progressives. We want to make society better. So one way we can do this very scientific, is affect who reproduces and therefore what the gene pool is. Um, there is a Supreme Court case on this topic, a notorious Supreme Court case. Uh, it has to my mind the single coldest sentence that I've ever read in law. Uh, it's a case Buck v. Bell, which, uh, have you done Buck v. Bell in common law? Anybody? No, it's like rarely done. Um, so I should say something about this set up for this is there's a woman, Carrie Buck, who's in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Her grandmother, I think, had been institutionalized. Her mother had been institutionalized. She gets institutionalized because trigger alert. I don't know if one does that anymore, but I'm about to tell you something very disturbing. Just be aware. She got institutionalized because she was raped by a relative and gave birth out of wedlock. So they declared that she's feebleminded and stick her in the Virginia colony for the for epileptics and the feebleminded, yes, Virginia state colony for the epileptics and the feebleminded. She, she was not a genius, but her IQ was like normal, like just basically squarely in the middle of the uh uh uh bell curve on that, um, so they put her in there and they decide that uh you don't want those people to be reproducing. So they were going to sterilize her. This was viewed as a good thing back then, because we're doing the eugenics thing. The Virginia government at that point was really keen on eugenics, so they're very excited about this. So they want to do this. Carrie Buck doesn't want to be sterilized, so she brings a suit. This case is horrifying in a bunch of ways. One of them is that the lawyer who is supposed to be representing her is basically throwing the case. Um, so it's not. This case gets appealed all the way up to the Supreme Court. Buck v. Bell. Um, in, uh, Oliver Wendell Holmes writes the opinion for the majority. And holds that the sterilization can go through. They can sterilize her, um, and then in that opinion writes the following sentence. Explaining his rationale, Three generations of imbeciles are enough unquote. There's an interview with her decades later, so she gets sterilized. There's an interview with her decades later and she just said, you know, very calmly, the decision made her sad because she wanted to have kids. I never could. Um, Did this, yeah, so I told us about this two years ago and a student, a student here actually, uh, highlighted, brought to my attention something really, uh, some useful information that I didn't know, um, that, uh. At the same time, the sterilization, uh, the eugenics law under which Carrie Buck was sterilized, the Virginia Sterilization Act, was enacted that very same year, in 1924, Virginia enacted a law called the Racial Integrity Act, which set up an official governmental registry of every Virginian's race, defined what was necessary to qualify as white under that statute. Made it a felony to file a registration that inaccurately stated one's race and prohibited marriages between whites and non-whites. Now Carrie Buck was white, so this was not a thing in which we're sterilizing people of non-white races, but I mean, it doesn't take a genius to connect some dots here, right? If you've got eugenics as a theory that certain people have good genes and should be allowed to breed and other people have bad genes and shouldn't be allowed to breed. You combine that with an explicit racial hierarchy about some races are better than others, and you can do the math. All right Um, so there's some lessons that come out of this story. First, these lessons is just because Oliver Wendell Holmes was famous, and we read a lot of Holmes' opinions in this course in law school, doesn't mean he was right about everything or that he was right about anything. Do not defer to authority. Right. Just because a social movement is really popular and your professors are telling you that this is the bee's knees here, right, that this is the thing here, don't necessarily go along with it. You gotta think for yourselves. Seriously, think critically about this stuff. All right, don't trust me. Don't trust, uh, don't trust the folks who are just telling you the way things are. All right, um, now a second lesson which I find really interesting, um, and there's actually a bunch of literature on this comes from thinking about the backgrounds of the various people who made decisions, uh, over the course of the Ploofy Putnam story, both when the storm arose and when the issue ended up in court. Um, there's a great paper by Dan Kahan and some other folks, Dan Kahan up at Yale, uh, from 2012, it just started to make some, make a comeback now, um, uh, about how people perceive facts. If you find this interesting, the whole literature on this is literature on this called the cultural cognition literature. So what Khan did is he and his co-authors did is they did, they did an experiment. So they got two groups of people, put them in separate rooms at separate times, and they showed each group a statute that basically prohibited people from interfering with other people who are trying to enter into various buildings, right, so it says don't interfere. Did I show them the text of the statute? And then they showed them, uh, showed each room a video of a protest, the paper's called They Saw a Protest, of a protest. Room one was told that the protest was outside a US military recruiting facility, and these people were protesting against a thing that doesn't exist now but at the time was the military's don't ask, don't tell policy, which basically was an anti-gay policy. So these folks are protesting against that. The other room was told that their video shows a protest outside an abortion center, and the people protesting are protesting against abortion. The people in each room were identified as whether they, uh, prior to being shown the video, whether their politics leaned left or leaned right. Right, they, uh, so one room is being shown a video that codes left, and the other people's uh room is being shown a video that codes right. Right. The video is identical. It is exactly the same video in both cases. But when shown, but the results that you got from the two rooms tracked very nicely the prior political commitments of each group looking at it. So the group that was shown the left wing protest, the people whose politics were toward the left said, oh yeah, there's even like specific factual things like was there confrontation? Was there physical impeding at any point. People who leaned left said no, no, none of that, and people who leaned right said, oh, absolutely. The other room, other protests that leaned right, exact opposite. Right wingers were saying, oh no, no, no, there's no impeding, none of that's going on. The left wingers absolutely right, this is a problem. Uh, you show a group of folks something and ask them seemingly objective questions. And they will come to very different conclusions based on their prior commitments. So this is why it's called the cultural cognition literature. Cognitions the sort of mental action, depends a lot on your cultural pre uh predispositions in things. Um, Would Putnam's servant have acted differently or perceived the situation differently if he hadn't been a millionaire servant? If there wasn't prejudice against French Canadians, if the loofs hadn't had a bad reputation, justified or unjustified. Would Buck v. Bell have been decided differently if there were people with different backgrounds and perspectives on the Supreme Court? Buck v. Bell was not a 9-0 decision. Holmes was furious about it. He desperately wanted, he was passionately committed to eugenics. Fervently wanted a 9-0. It was an 8-1. The one dissenter With a guy named Pierce Butler, whom if you've heard of him at all, you've heard of him as one of the conservative four horsemen of the apocalypse in the Lochner era there. So he's one of these guys striking down a bunch of progressive laws, and he voted, so he dissented, as was common at the time, he didn't write a dissent. That was typical back then. You just recorded a dissenting vote and that was it. So we don't know what he was thinking. Holmes in correspondence that we have uh says uh was convinced that the reason Pierce Butler voted the way he did is because Butler was a Roman Catholic and therefore his religious beliefs were not allowed to sign on to the eugenics thing. Holmes was furious about that. All right, so if we had had maybe a different religious makeup, more religious diversity on the court, would that have changed things? Would it have mattered if say there had been a woman on the bench, right? There were no women on the bench back then. Would that have been different? Um, How do we deal with the fact in our own personal lives and also in the law that how we recognize facts, how we assess facts, depends on the What we're bringing into it already. I mean this is an issue, right? Judges have to assess facts, juries assess facts. How do you do this? Well, one thing is to try to recognize the potential sources of your own biases, including being surrounded by like-minded people and today including spending your online time surrounded by like-minded people. We've got algorithms that are designed to put you in a bubble and they make you mad. Right, that's it, so we put you in the bubble and make you mad, um. You can try to limit that Alright, uh, you can, this actually might be a thing that AI might be good for, right? Ask Chappy GBT like what do you give them some argument that you like find kind of persuasive and ask him like what are the arguments on the other side, something like that might be useful, um, but at the end of the day it's going to be a little bit tricky to do that, perhaps completely effectively because of the limitations of human nature, right? We just, we like our biases. It's hard to do this, um, so we need some other way of mitigating the problem, right? And this, to my mind, is one reason why having a diversity of folks with various backgrounds is really useful and things because people just see things in different ways, uh, based on, you know, their experiences, and this is critical in the law too. Note that the jury ultimately did fine for the loofs. Who was on the jury? We don't know. Right, they found for the police but didn't award a lot of money. You know what's going on with that? Don't know. All right, so that's my sales pitch to you for diversity and why that's important, and I will finish. You're probably sold on that anyway, but whatever. I'm going to give you the sermon. And then the final lesson on this is just there is a necessity exception. Write that down. It's on the bar.
