OK, folks. Uh, audio check. How audible am I in the back? Not good? OK. Ah Yeah. OK, how about now? Uh, people, people directly in front of me can hear me. People in the back they have no idea that I'm even here. All right, that doesn't sound good. All right, well. All right, how about that? OK. All right. Boom. Ah. A little bit nervous about that thing. I feel like there's two settings, completely useless and feedback. Um, trying to avoid that there. All right. Uh, so welcome back everybody. I hope, uh, you had a good weekend. Um. A new syllabus installment is available for downloading on courseworks at your convenience, um, in the syllabus place. Um, Reminder that uh next week, next Tuesday, we will not be, um, um, meeting because of the, um, uh, wait, what, what, what day, what day today is, what day is today? Alright, yeah, today's the 10th. OK, so good, um, so next week, uh, we will not be meeting on Tuesday, uh, I said we will have a makeup session scheduled, uh, for that following Friday that is on the syllabus, so you don't need to memorize any of this stuff. The information is just there. Just look at the syllabus and that'll tell you where and when and it should be recorded. So if you can't make it on Friday, I completely understand. Also, if you can make it on Friday and just don't want to make it on Friday, I completely understand, yeah. Thought it was on the syllabus section. Oh yeah. Yeah, all right, so. Right, and uh we're in a different room and so a different time and you'll see it. OK, uh, last class, we began. By um. Turn to the question of what sorts of things can um or should be ownable as property, and that was uh Moore versus Regents of the University of California, uh, which raised this issue in the context of owning body parts. The Court held that Moore did not have a property right to his spleen, um, and therefore he had no rights to the income streams that were derived or at least potentially might be derived, um, from research that was focused in part on that spleen. And the court's analysis proceeded in two parts. First, it concluded the existing law of conversion didn't give Moore any rights to the spleen once it was outside his body and offered two main arguments to this. First, there was no reported decision that. Supported Moore's claim as precedent. biomedical items, the court said are regulated through an entirely separate specialized body of law and therefore general property law shouldn't be applied to them. Second, uh, the court said California statutes limit patients' interests in the cells of their body after they have been excised from, after they've been taken out of their body, and does so so much that those things then cease to qualify as property, rewording the court's argument in terms of the bundle of rights conception of property, which we discussed is very common, um. So many elements have been removed from the bundle of what your right of what uh the person with the body, the part was taken from, what their rights are so many elements are removed from that bundle that what remains ceases to be property. Justice Moss's dissent argued, as I reworded it in the context of uh using the bundle of rights language. That the particular removed elements that the majority focuses on are elements that have been removed from other things, bundles, and yet we don't consider those other things to have ceased to be to have ceased to be property as a result. So other things lose those elements in the bundle, they're still property, so why not slits. OK, but the majority says existing toward a conversion doesn't apply. To excise spleens. Raises the question, should it be expanded? Should it be extended to include excise plans? And to address that it balanced policy considerations between patients' concerns for like dignity and privacy against researchers' needs to be feeling to be able to feel secure from liability when they conduct research on cells that they were not directly involved in, you know, taking so they get some cells from some. Biomedical data provision place and they need to feel secure that they can go ahead and do research on that. Balances out those two interests and concludes that the scientific interest outweighs the dignity and privacy interest. The scientific research had high social value. We'll try to find a treatment for cancer. All right, very important. And the patient dignity and privacy could be protected through other ways through disclosure. The court also gave an institutional competence argument. It says there are deep policy. Issues here complex policy questions that need to be resolved in order to figure out whether to extend conversion to body parts and courts just aren't well situated to do that. Judges aren't well qualified to do that. Legislatures are better situated than courts are, so we should leave this to legislatures to do. Um, we know that Justice Moss's dissent focused on what Mos considered to be unequal bargaining power in the granting of consent. So the basic suggestion is that, uh, the majority's reliance on the ability of informed consent to protect dignity and privacy Mosque finds basically unpersuasive because there is no plausible. Consent in the context of in this sort of context, the bargaining power is just far too tilted in favor of the uh uh the medical centers and against the patients and he also focused on what he saw as exploitation involved in scientists. Who come up with valuable valuable medical developments based on other people's tissues on those scientists getting 100% of the wealth generated by that. Moss thought that that was exploitation and that the wealth should be shared with the people whose body parts have been used uh for this. Um, and in this context we noted, uh, concerns that run throughout the law about commodification of this, that, and the other thing, and in this case commodification of body parts and by extension commodification of human beings. Um, and we also noted briefly that there's, uh, variations on this concern that arise in the context of, uh, plants in the Amazon, things like that. So, uh, what critics refer to as bio piracy by pharma companies going in and making a lot of money. Off of stuff that is in the Amazon and maybe the locals there knew or at least believed had some useful medical purpose and the locals get nothing and the pharma companies get everything and that may seem to be unfair in the mosque to be unfair. All right, we then started discussing, so up to this point we've been talking about A, how do you come to acquire property, and B, what kinds of things should be ownable as property. Then we turn to the question of why the heck any of this matters? Like what is it, uh. I'm not offended. That's all right. No need to apologize. Um, the, um, uh. What does it matter? What do you get? If you have property, what does property ownership give you? Right, and one central thing that it gives you is the right to exclude the right to exclude others from. The property, whatever it is, right, and in the context of real property, dirt and buildings, that's protected by the law of trespass and so we had Jacques V Steinberg Homes as an example of this. Delivery of a mobile home across somebody else's property without their permission. The jury found that there were no actual damages, so no compensatories to award, but nevertheless awarded $100,000 in punitive damages. Steinberg Holmes challenged the award, appealing to what they said was an established rule that if there are no compensatory damages, then there can be no punitive damages. And here the court rejects that rule as inapplicable to intentional torts as opposed to negligence or something like that. Quotes Mis versus Harvey, If a defendant won't act like a gentleman, then heavy damages are necessary to deter him. So if the rule were that there be no punitive damages absent actual damages, nothing would exist to deter that non-gentlemanly person. If Steenberg Holmes won't act like a gentleman, heavy damages are necessary to deter. The real harm, the court said, was not anything tangible. Sure, there's no harm to like the ground or the plants or anything like that. No tangible injury, but there was an injury to the right to exclude. That have been infringed and the court allows a $100,000 punitive damages award to protect that right. So we saw that property rights include a strong right to exclude even without physical damage to the property. There's a violation of that right, and even if the decision to exclude seems unreasonable, nevertheless, the owner has the right to exercise that exclusion right. The right to exercise a right is probably incoherent, but the owner has an exclusion right that he or she can exercise. OK, uh, at the end of the class I asked for a quick show of hands like how many people thought that case was rightly decided and how many people thought it was wrongly decided, and there was enough of a split in the room. Some years it's like completely one side and, uh, uh, and almost nobody on the other, and some years it's completely on the other side and nobody on the first side, and some years it's split. Um, this year it seems to be split, so great, worth actually than talking about this because we can maybe have a little bit of a debate here um. Uh, so again, show of hands, how many people think that this case was rightly decided? Yeah, you should be able to exclude these folks here. OK, how many people think that it's wrongly decided, should not have been able to exclude. All right, I think fewer people are voting this time, and again, you know, it was, uh, it's been I've had a weekend there. In the interim, um, OK, so let's, let's start with the critics, I guess. So somebody thinks it was wrongly decided, um. Why? What's what, what's wrong with it? Um Yeah I think the decision itself is like fine,

SPEAKER 1
but the proportion of punitive versus compensatory damage is ridiculous. Like, um, I feel like the reading either mentioned it or I might be imagining, but the Supreme Court case that comes a little bit afterwards establishing some kind of like ratio. I believe like punitive can only be 9 times. That of compensatory like so that that's a pretty um like intuitive decision, right? And I feel like that applies here as well. OK, so uh you might have a set of concerns.

SPEAKER 0
There's two issues, right? Um, my question was ambiguous between them. Uh, 11 issue is should there be um. Uh, a strong right to exclude here. So should, um, the Jacques be able to get some award from Steinberg Holmes? Second issue is if so what should that award be? um, so the case Mr. Min was referring to there is State Farm versus Campbell Supreme Court case decided after this case. It says presumptively ratios between punitives and cabet stories that exceed a single digit ratio, which means 9 to 1, um, are presumptively suspect. Not dispositive but presumptively suspect. Now there's a couple of things that might have been affecting this here, so. This is all great stuff. I would tell you to take remedies if you're interested in this, but I'm not sure that Columbia Law School offers remedies. So I think my suggestion to you is to go talk to Vice Dean Heller and ask for Columbia Law School to offer remedies and then take remedies. Um, uh, one of the things that, uh, if you do study punitive damages, one of the things that's, uh, one of the ordinary considerations arise in the context of punitive damages. you need to make them high enough. To make the defendant is sometimes said, feel the sting of it. Jacques B. Steenberg Homes is a case in which we have an individual suing Steenberg Homes, a company, a mobile home company. Mobile home company probably is, yeah, they're selling mobile homes. They probably have a fairly thriving business. Something that's less than 100,000 may not be enough for them actually to notice that much, right? So maybe that's what's going on there. Also, if you were to apply, if you're just to mechanically apply State Farm versus Gamble to this case, right, the maximum permissible punitives would be what? $9. How much of a deterrent effect would, yeah, so you're getting $1 nominal plus $9 in punitives, $10 you know, I, yeah, Steenberg Holmes is just laughing as they, they carry it around in their pocket, right? So presumably you're going to have to have something higher, but what it, what it should be all right, that's a question. All right, um, someone else on the, uh, didn't like it, yeah. Um, I guess I have a more fundamental objection which is that I think, you know, private property rights, they're creatures of the state, um, and so they should be subject to, uh, you know, policy concerns oriented around the state, um, and around society more broadly which the state represents, uh, so in this case, like. There's, uh, you know, sure, you have a right to exclude people from your property, but, you know, there's, uh, if that right is violated, there's an avenue to solve that, that society has decided on and it's to pay you back whatever you lost. And if you were like severely emotionally traumatized or something by this trailer being dragged across your ground, OK, then go into the court and prove that emotional damage and convince them to pay for it, but in the absence of that. Uh, I don't think there's any compelling reason why like property rights should be so sacrosanct. OK, so. Um, is it Mr. Rosenblatt, right, yeah, um, Mr. Rosenblatt, uh, um, a couple of interesting things coming out of there. First of all, suggestion that property rights are a creature of the state created by the state, right, um, a lot of people say that. I've kind of suggested that and suggested property law is an institution, and that is a common thing to say. Um, not everyone would agree. Right, uh, especially, um, if you are of a more libertarian bent and more of a natural law bent, right, uh, it's a question like what the authority of the state comes from, right, and so you might view that individuals have certain rights. And given that they have these rights, then the authority of the state is derivative from and limited by the rights of the individuals we're making the state in that case, then there's a question as to what those rights might be, and one of them might be a right of property. Famously, right, the Declaration of Independence protects the life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Earlier draft was life, liberty, and property. Some people were fighting for that. And so there's a question, right? So that's an issue. Um, uh, a lot of people would agree with Mr. Rosenblatt, but I just want to point out that not everyone would, right? So there's a, there's an issue there, um. And, but do you wanna weigh in on that? Uh, I was gonna add a little bit to what Henry was saying, but I can wait. OK, well, I, I just felt like it was a pretty big overextension of the right to exclude on your property, um, kind of for similar reasons that you should be able to take into account policy concerns. So for example, it sounded like they couldn't really take the road, um, because there's what, 7 ft of snow. A pretty big turn, relatively dangerous, and I, I think that is something a court should take into account when considering the right to exclude, especially if there's like literally no harm happening to the person who owns the property. So it just felt like an overextension of the right to me. OK, so the idea, so this may be actually, uh, nicely getting a little bit ahead, uh, what we're talking about. So there are gonna be various exceptions to the right to exclude. One of them is necessity. So you might think, OK, necessity may play a role here. Now whether there's a necessity to go into somebody else's property without the permission to save your life might be different from the necessity to cut across somebody's property in order to deliver a summer cottage during the winter, but there may be some like. The availability of other alternatives may be relevant for sussing this out. All right, so you spoke most recently, so I'm gonna, I'll give you the hypo. So here we go. Um, so I believe there was a Super Bowl played this past weekend. Um, I did not see it because I don't have a TV. Um, because I don't have a TV, I therefore do not have like cable, and so therefore you can't actually see anything unless I'm paying like 100 bucks a month. Or something for cable for a TV I don't have, so I didn't see it. Uh, uh, followed it a little bit online. You can do a lot of these like score tracker things and seemed kind of dull until the 4th quarter. Um, uh, all right, so I don't have, I don't have a TV. Suppose I really wanted to see the Super Bowl though, and suppose you have a TV in your apartment. Um, and suppose that you're not gonna be using it to watch the Super Bowl because you're going actually to somebody else's Super Bowl party. Um, and I have no way of seeing the TV. I, I've seen the Super Bowl unless I go somewhere else. And so I just come up with the following plan. In fact, I execute the following plan. I, um, identify where you live. I know that you're going to be going over to the party, so I go into your apartment. And I watch the Super Bowl there, but I am a neat freak. So when I come in, uh, first I go look around and I go, OK, I'll do some vacuuming. So I vacuum the place and then I sit down and I watch the Super Bowl and then. Without damaging anything, and then when it is over, I leave $5 on the coffee table to cover the cost of electricity and the depreciation of the television and the carpet and the couch, and then I also like scrub the bathtub too because I was like, OK, so I clean it up. So now I leave. So your apartment is now better off than it was when I came in. Your actual damages here appear to be zero or negative. Let's set aside the possibility that you would actually owe me anything for that. Uh, you wouldn't because of certain doctrines of restitution, um, but it looks like right there I have inflicted zero actual damage on you. Should you be able to get a recovery against me? Yes, but I, I think that's because this to me feels like an appropriate use of the right to exclude this person has gone. I mean, you would theoretically have gone into my apartment where I am, I have all my personal belongings, um, I keep all of my valuable items. You've used my couch, you've used multiple of my items without. Having asked, it seems like, like that is an area where I think the right to exclude is appropriately used and you should have punitive damages. So suppose that I'm not, uh, suppose that I like I, I didn't go to your medicine cabinet or anything like that. I just, I sat on the couch, but I'm clean, right? I had laundered my clothes immediately before coming there, right? So everything is extremely clean. All right, um, and I don't peer in anything, um, I just like I noticed that there's on, on the carpet it's like, oh, OK, all right, the, uh, needs vacuuming, and there's a vacuum cleaner, like, you know, some one of these Dyson things it's like plugged in the wall, right, that just started charging there. So, I just took it and vacuumed the thing up, and I, you know, tidy everything up, and it's very nice, uh, now, um, you've suffered no actual injury. Uh, now there's a possibility that it could have gone differently, but it didn't. Just as with Steenberg Homes, it's a possibility that Steenberg Homes could have botched delivering the mobile home as they're doing there, and so they suddenly slide or something and the mobile home goes crashing into the Jacques' house and actually damages their house. Didn't happen. Pretty unlikely maybe based on where it went, but it could have gone. It could have happened. So what's the difference between the two? Between the possibility of the house sliding into, I mean, I think that there is a pretty big difference between going off like traversing land where I mean there's no house in sight and it's pretty empty, um, it's covered in snow, so you're not even touching the land versus going into someone's apartment and using all of their stuff and maybe, maybe you're happy because it's clean that's like really nice of you to have cleaned everything, but still. Um, you've, you've crossed a pretty significant boundary by going into like that level of personal space, whereas when you're just crossing someone's property, I mean I'm not saying that you should be allowed to cross everyone's property, um, although I like I am kind of pro right to roam and for the most part, but. Like, maybe you should have some rights to exclude on your property if you're like living in the suburban neighborhood and you have a fenced in front yard and whatnot, um, but I think that it's like it's pretty clear that there was no harm in this case, um, and perhaps there was the risk that the mobile home would like crash into the other home and actually cause harm, but in that case then you would get compensatory harm but like the idea of just giving. Incredibly high punitive damages because you have a really small risk of possibly having compensatory harm, um, in a case like this just feels like an overextension of the right. All right, so I'll let you go, but I will have one final observation here, right? So the one issue is whose intuitions govern here, right? So, uh, so Ms. Worth, right, so Ms. Worth's intuitions are pretty much Steenberg Homes, yeah, that, that thing, it's like, yeah, you can't exclude that, but you can't exclude from the apartments because that, that, that's too much of an intrusion. All right, and maybe you share those intuitions, um, but at some level they're just an intuition and that might make people a little nervous. How do you decide whose intuitions are right? And so a famous example, somebody who might not have shared that intuition is, uh, if you're a little bit older, you may remember Bill Walton, who if you're really old, you remember Bill Walton as a basketball player. Um, he also did NBA games. He was an announcer for NBA games for many, many years, died a few years ago. Um, famously, I I think he's an, I think he's an NBA Hall of Famer. Um, also a famously a hippie and like an unreconstructed hippie, just a 100% hippie, the entire, uh, uh, his entire life. And one of the interesting ways that showed up is that he had a very, very nice house in Los Angeles and He just left it open. So that people could like go in and go into his rec room and shoot pool there, people he did not know at all, and he was just like cool with it. It's like, yeah, you know, you know, don't, don't trash the place, but as long as that's fine, you know, I don't care. It's like come on in. All right, his intuitions, I think would be like, yeah, whatever, you know, I'm not using the place. You can go ahead and use it. Um, uh, so how do we decide, right, uh, which sort of intuitions about no that that that's gone too far, um, that's not gentlemanly. Um, that is, how do we decide which ones to privilege and which one's not to, and I, I that's not a criticism, uh, that is merely pointing out a, uh, an issue that arises and is going to arise no matter what position you take on this. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think then it seems like what the like the line is like less so a matter of law and it's like a matter of fact in the societal norm that you're operating in. So wouldn't that just be for like a jury to decide where is that bundle, like what is that bundle of rights, where is the line? Was this an unreasonable thing to like not allow um. You know, the trailer from going through the other person's land, was it right or wrong or OK for you to go into Heather's apartment during the Super Bowl? Like, wouldn't that just be for like a more localized jury to decide? All right, so one possibility is you could say we're seen as community norms, right? That sort of appeals to the custom idea, right? We're gonna look at what custom is and what people ordinarily think of as appropriate behavior and, uh, inappropriate behavior, and that will govern. And maybe that's the right way to go. But it's not, it's not the way that Jacques B. Steinberg homes. and it's not necessarily what everyone would think should go, right? The actual rule is you can exclude people for all sorts of unreasonable reasons, reasons that other people think are unreasonable, and why should somebody who maybe has really serious concerns about certain things. Be subject to, well, other people think it's cool to go on your property under those circumstances. If you're one of those other people, maybe that seems fine, but if you're the person who has the, uh, atypical preferences, why should your preferences necessarily take a backseat, uh, to what the community thinks? Now this then, I mean sometimes it's gonna have to, right? So we're gonna talk about all sorts of exceptions to the right to exclude, right? But when should those exceptions apply, right? That's a deep question. So it's a nice way of raising that. All right, uh, we've heard from people who are criticizing, uh, the decision. How about people who think that it's rightly decided? Somebody give me an argument here. Uh, let's see. All right, the hand I saw is it Miss Charis.

SPEAKER 2
Yes. um, I saw it more from a safety perspective that if we allow, um, the Steenberg homes to just cross over, um, this land, then like what stops someone else from deciding to like, come into my backyard and watch me through the window? Or like, I don't even think you need to like extend it to the extreme of you went into somebody's house and watched the Super Bowl. Like, what if you just wanted to watch the Super Bowl through the window? And like that still feels violating in another way. And like, I think it's hard to draw the line between like what is considered an acceptable trespass versus an unacceptable trespass because everybody has very different thresholds. Um, but I think that if we kind of allow anyone to walk on any property, then it also like, will raise a lot of safety concerns, especially for people who maybe like are older or like live at home alone.

SPEAKER 0
Uh, so it may be safety issues, but also may just be privacy issues, right? I think the example you're giving the variant on the Merritz versus Harvey, uh, hypo there which in which instead of looking at people as they're watching dinner, you're looking through the glass that they're, uh, uh, watching the Super Bowl, um, that is maybe not so much a safety concern as maybe a privacy concern, but a lot of people would be freaked out by that, um, and. What's the harm, right? Well, all right, how do you decide that? OK, so you might want to say that some people just are, some people might not care, some people could. Maybe the optimal way to decide that is to let the people who own the property decide whether they care about it or not. Um, All right, there we go. I also thought that there's potentially like a legitimacy issue regarding like the institution of property if you could just, if you're forced to allow anybody to come onto your property, then it kind of becomes a question of like what's the point of me paying property tax if I can't exclude anybody from coming on my property, you know, it kind of like obstructs like the legitimacy of the institution of property and, and like allowing your property right to be invaded by anybody, your privacy right. All right, so. You know how the law school game is played now, right? No matter what you say, I'm gonna disagree, right? Um, so, uh, so now I was, uh, pressing the people who say, oh, this case was wrongly decided. It's not hypo, uh, if it's rightly decided, right? Uh, so suppose. That, um, using, uh. The road was basically so cutting across the property was basically necessary in order to deliver the the summer home. And suppose that the Jacques motivation, and I have, I don't know anything about the Jacques at all, this is purely a hypo, purely hypo, right? Suppose that Jacques' motivation for denying permission was that they knew who the neig knew who the neighbors were and they didn't like their race or they didn't like their religion, they don't like them, right, uh, for some reason, and so they wanted to prevent them from having a summer home and moving in nearby and so, hey, here's the way we could do this. Right, should they still be allowed to exclude? Uh, I would say yes, actually, because I think that in my opinion, the, the scenario is less so like their hatred for their neighbor and it's more so a question of can this individual, meaning like the mobile company, can, is there like individual incentive to make a profit and deliver more important than your property, right? And I don't think that it should take. Precedent over your own property, right, because then it's like, well then why can't I just go on somebody's like yard and like kill ducks on it because like I want to take their carcass and sell it. Like I don't think that your like individual, uh, like profit motive should usurp somebody's property right, and I think that like they're not forbidding them from being able to deliver it. It's just under those specific circumstances, it's not possible and I, they could deliver it in a month from then when it's actually possible. All right, uh, Ms. Betts. Um, I was gonna say, I think in the, this kind of hints on some of the other readings, but in the, the idea of property rights and profit to Nua's point, I'm not convinced by, but the idea of like, oh, do I, do I need your property to save myself from death or like the necessity thing. Um, I, I do understand that and I do think that's where it reaches its limit truly when we're talking about things like life and death and not like $1 or however many dollars versus $0. Yeah, I don't quite remember like how we got here, but I agree with Noah's point, um, sorry, um, because it's not my business to like I don't, it's not my responsibility to help you make profit because you decided to factor my land into your plan like it's my land, um. And again there's just like I just think of like again like the structural meanings or like implications behind these things because like again sometimes land is all people have and we're just saying free for all you have to make a deal. I mean you have to make a closure I what am I trying to say you're trying to deliver this home and so we're gonna let you just cross over this part of land like at some point we have to draw a line and like again it's not your it's not my job to make your like profit possible. so. One of the thing I think that's interesting that's coming out of this discussion and not surprisingly, it doesn't surprise me, but it's useful that it comes out is that a lot of this at the end of the day is resting on people's intuitions just people have strong intuitions about what it is that ownership should entitle them to, what they should be allowed to exclude people from, what they should be allowed to do, you know, what they should not be excluded from, and uh. Maybe if you want to get very philosophical, you could try to have some theory that will try to systematize that or provide some justification for it, but the law doesn't, as a practical matter doesn't get that philosophical and so we sort of in a democratic process kind of come up with some sort of thing, um, uh, but at the end of the day a lot of this is. Resting on people's intuitions, often quite deeply felt intuitions about what it is that's appropriate for them for them to be able to do with their stuff, and I think that reflects also an idea about what they should be allowed to do with their lives in some in some way, right? OK, great, so a useful discussion, um. That takes us to Hinman. Hinman versus Pacific Air Transport. If we're going to have a strong right to exclude, and we just saw in Jacky. Steinberg Homes, if you do have a strong right to exclude, right, then it makes a big difference how extensive the scope of one's property rights are. Because whatever they are, you can exclude from them, even for unreasonable, unreasonable grounds. Um, and we saw this with the ad colame inferos doctrine. I remember uh Emson, the poet, Law makes long spokes the short stakes of men, right? Law makes long spokes, the short stakes of men. How long should those spokes be? We had touched touched on that before in the context of subsurface um resources, Edwards versus Sims, the cave case, Himman versus Pacific Air Transport. We talk about it in the other direction, airspace above the surface. Ninth Circuit case, 1936, page, oh yeah, 10, page 10. So the setup for this is the Pacific Air Transport, which you haven't heard of, and United Airlines, which you probably have heard of, operated a commercial airline. United Airlines was the product was formed in 1928 as a merger of four different airlines, and Pacific Air Transport was part of that merger. Pacific Air Transport flew aircraft over Hinman's land. At times, according to the court, according to the decision here, flying below 100 ft. Alright, so less than 100 ft over the surface of the land. If you actually read not the excerpted version of the case, not the casebook version, but the full version, I just go read the full version. It says that at some points these planes flew as low as 5 ft over Hinman's land. All right. Why would it be doing that? Because Hinman's land was next door to an airport, the Burbank Airport. Southern California. All right. Plans were taken off and landing because it turns out their, their land was right at the end of the runway there, so they're right in the takeoff and landing pattern there. Um, Hinman of the parcel was pretty big, 72 acres plus, so 70, 70 to 75 acres, a pretty big parcel. Hinman sued seeking both an injunction and $90,000 in damages. Adjust that damages award to today's money, about $2 million. They claimed ownership of the land up to at least 150 ft, sorry, the air above the land, up to at least 150 ft. Um, Hinman's suit is dismissed, so the airlines win. All right? How does it get there? The court says that the ad coilum doctrine never was the law, right, so as a result, don't need to worry about the possibility of overruling it here because it never was the law in the first place. The court says it's old, it's in Latin, so we know it's old, and was never taken literally. Remember the dissent in Sims, uh, the cave case also said that the ad coilum doctrine never was the law, so. Similar ideas The Henman court says what the ad Kum doctrine. Really means and really has always meant, is just that the owner is allowed to use the sky above his land as much as he's able to without interference with from other people. So if you own some land, you're allowed to use the air above your land as much as you actually can without interference from other people. In other words, the ad coilum rule merely gives a right to use the air without interference, not a general right to exclude other people from this. It's a use right, not a possessory right. Now why is this? The court gives an argument. They say you can't own an infinity. Right. Remember, Ad Coilum, right, goes all the way up there. You're out there, distant galaxies, you own that. Death Star, you own that. Uh, cosmology at the time, I don't think they realized that the universe maybe wraps around. I think it does. Like it's shaped like some sort of weird bottle-like thing and it wraps around. Um, so it's like you keep going out forever. That, the court thinks that's incoherent, right. Um, and equity, which is what's involved if you're asking for an injunction, can't prevent quote a supposed violation of an abstract conception, unquote. Here you might compare the dissent in Edwards versus Sims again about ownership of the cave, right? Is FP Lee's ownership, that's the neighbor's ownership, the guy who doesn't have the, the entrance to the cave is his ownership unquote. Of the cave that he physically cannot access, just an abstract conception. Alright, now the court derives this conclusion that you can't own an infinity. Makes no sense here from basic legal principles. Right Uh, Elementary legal principles says the essence of property is dominion. Therefore, property, in order to be property must be capable of exclusive possession. Dominion is control, right? Uh, you control the thing. Therefore, if something's going to be property, it's got to be something that you could. Possess exclusively, keep other people from possessing it while you have it, right, um. Put in bundle of rights language, we talked about how you could take some elements out of the bundle and you still have property, um, and the court's not denying that, but what it's suggesting, it doesn't use the bundle of rights language, but putting it into that language, what it's suggesting is that there are certain elements in the bundle that if you take those elements out, you no longer have property. You may have something, whatever you have isn't property. The right to exclude is one of them. The idea is if your exclusion is one of them. So if you take that out, if that's no longer part of your bundle, then what you have just isn't property anymore. So if the right to exclude is meaningless because possession is actually impossible in practice, then it makes no sense to be talking about owning this thing as property. Whatever you got just isn't a property bundle. Right. And then the court says that the air and the sea are incapable of private ownership, except to the extent that it actually can be used. Um Again, if we were to use this sort of language in talking about Edwards versus Sims, you might say with respect to the cave that um if you can't access the cave because you don't have the entrance, then you can't exert any control over what happens in it. And so therefore it makes no sense to talk about owning. The chunk of the cave that happens to be below. The surface of the land that you own because you can't exercise any dominion over it's just not possible. Now the court having laid that out for like, all right, so now. Can't be property if you can't exercise, if it's like impossible to exercise control over. Having said that, it then gives us a rule, but in doing so, I think it switches inconsistently. So it's not quite apt what they do here from talking about what can be used. To what actually is used. The rule is, the court says, a landowner owns as much space above his land as he actually uses. But only so long as he's actually using it. OK, so if you own some land. You own some airspace, but only that's defined by what you are actually using and only so long as you're actually using it. The owner would then have a trespass claim for any use of such air or space by others. Which is, and two possibilities here injurious to his land. Or which constitutes an actual interference with his possession or his beneficial use thereof. All right, so it's a trespass if the defendant uses airspace above somebody else's land, and in so doing, either injures the land below, you know, sets fire to the grass or something. Or actually interferes with the owner's possession or beneficial use of cough, cough, um, unclear here. It says thereof. It's not clear whether thereof refers to the land or to the airspace. Grammatically, it refers to the land. I'm guessing they may have meant the airspace interfering with the beneficial use of the airspace, but courts didn't draft this very well, so if that's what they meant, it's not quite what they said, so it's a little bit ambiguous there, um. But there's gonna be actual interference with something. At least we know that. All right, otherwise the court gives a rationale for this rule. It says otherwise it would just be impracticable and there'd be endless confusion. How could courts protect landowners' claims to various remote portions of the land? How do you enforce a right of ejectment, right? It would be a radical departure, quote, It is opposed to common sense and to all human experience, unquote. Um, and the court that explicitly mentioned something that no doubt is weighing heavily on the court's calculations here. If it were to hold otherwise. If it were to say, That, uh, oh yeah, um, Himden's have a right to exclude here now we've got massive problems for two industries that are taking off at this time in the world and are super important. Airplanes, air travel, and radio. All right, because the basic thing is with airplanes, right, they fly over land. They can fly over water too, but they're also flying off and over land, and there's a whole lot of it. My family all lives out in California, so twice a year I fly cross country and you look down and if you do this, get yourself a window seat so you can look down and see America and it's very interesting. Um, and when you're flying over the Midwest, as you see all sorts of farms just like carved out, you can see exactly where the property lines are on these things. It's following the grid system set up by the Northwest Ordinance there. It's, uh, uh, all very regular and geometric, but you're flying over a gazillion of them. If Delta, whoever has the cheapest tickets, because that's who I'm flying, uh, is, is going to make that flight, if everybody had the right to exclude from the air above their land, Delta would have to acquire permission from every single one of those people. Massive assembly costs, massive transaction costs, all sorts of holdout problems, just a mess. Likewise with radio. Radio back then is basically what the internet now is today, right? So we had radio and then we had television, and then we had the internet. It was the source of entertainment, the source of news, huge thing. But the way radio works right is you get an antenna and it's pumping out radio waves and those waves just go out everywhere. Go over everybody's property. If you had to get permission to have the waves go across the property from each of the people that whose property crossed, you couldn't have radio, might just be way too expensive. Not, not feasible. Now the court then does something also just useful. It's obvious, but it's worth stating the obvious. It says, look, the traditional rule for trespass is that if there's a trespass, you can get at least nominal damages. We saw that in Jacques B. Steinberg homes, right? Set aside the punitives, you got, even though there's no actual damage, you still got a $1 in nominals. You get something. So in order to prevail on a trespass suits, you don't have to show any actual loss. Um But that doesn't matter here. The court says whether the Hinmans show any actual loss. It doesn't matter because trespass requires it to be a property right, and the Hinmans simply do not have a property right at all to what they were claiming to that airspace. So therefore there's just nothing to trespass on. If I walk across the Brooklyn Bridge without your permission. There is no trespass liability, but not because of the fact that I haven't caused you any damage, even though I haven't, but because of the fact that you don't have any exclusive right to the Brooklyn Bridge. There's no property right for me to have infringed. OK, any questions on this?

SPEAKER 3
So what happens if the Himans just built something that was like 150 ft, like a little like pole basically, to sort of mark out that they were now using that land.

SPEAKER 0
Holmes, Oliver Wendell Holmes said, right, you must, in order to understand the law, you must think of it from the perspective of the bad man, right, what the bad man would do, and conveniently the bad man did do exactly what is it Mr. Troy? No. Oh yeah, Mr. Lev, right, sorry. I'm getting, I'm, I'm, I am adjusting to the new medium sized seating chart here and therefore my instincts as to who's sitting where are are not quite so good yet, but I'll I'll get it down. All right, so Mr. Love's point here is anticipated a century ago by the actual Hinmans who lose, they lose this case and they read it. And they understand it and so they say, well, as long as we're actually using the land, then the airspace and then we're good. So they just erected some poles and some derricks on the property line between them and the airport, right, thus using. The airspace up there, um, why did they do that? Well, uh, a little background information probably would be useful here. Uh, they did it because they're jerks, um, but also there's some other, uh, you know, why they, why did their jerkiness take this particular form. So the airport in question was called Burbank Airport back then. Nowadays it's called Hollywood Burbank Airport. It's back then it was one of several airports in the, well there are several airports in the Los Angeles area. There were several back then too. Um, one of the interesting things about it at that time is that that airport was the airport that was most frequently used by Hollywood movie stars. Why? Because it was the one that was closest to Hollywood. So Hollywood stars would fly into Burbank. Um, According to one source that I found, uh, online, the. The terminal, the air terminal at Hollywood Burbank was the first multi-million dollar air terminal in the United States of America. They spent a bunch of money on the terminal. You got movie stars flying in and out. Um, the Hinman's property was almost entirely vacant. It was just, it was almost entirely a vacant lot. A big thing on which nothing grew, um, probably weeds, but like they weren't doing anything with it. Um, starting in 1933, 3 years earlier. The Hinmans had sought to lease their land to the airport. They see the airport's coming in. They said, Hey, you're probably going to be flying, you know, right along here. Might be useful maybe to have some rights to this land here. So how about you lease it. They were not able to reach a deal because the Hinmans were insisting on a price that was far higher than the market rate for that land. They were trying to basically hold up the airport. Nice airport you got, shame if something would happen to it. So they're holding out for an excessively large amount of money, so the airport says screw you, we're not going to do it. One thing to note is that 1933 was very close to the very depths of the Great Depression. The Great Depression was seriously bad economically. At this time, the unemployment rate was around 25%, and I believe that number understates things it doesn't actually talk about doesn't include farm employment. So one in four people were looking for work and just unable to find work, period. Very, very bad, so money's tight, right, um. So they're trying, they were trying to basically hold up the airport. They bring this suit, they lose the suit, so then they go, OK, I'll put up the poles. So they put up the poles in the derrick there again. Hey, do you really wanna run the risk of Humphrey Bogart dying in a fiery plane crash there before your time, but he was big back in the day. How many people here have seen a Humphrey Bogart film? Uh, to make that, how many, how many of those, how, how many of you have seen Casablanca? Alright, OK, so now at least know, alright, OK, alright, Maltese Falcon. All right, Maltese Maltese Falcons worth seeing. All right, um. Recently saw a Humphrey Bogart film that was kind of obscure at the time. Now I guess it is critically well regarded, very different, really good, called In a Lonely Place, kind of, kind of depressing, but it's a really, really good drama. All right, so Humphrey Bogart was the biggest star in Hollywood back then, like literally the biggest star in Hollywood. He dies in a fiery plane crash, you know, not good for business there. So they put up the polls. Court strikes this down in a subsequent litigation. Court says no. You can't do that. Um, they strike it down basically as a nuisance. They say that it is a thing and there's actual doctrine, there's a term for this, but there's actual doctrine about it. We'll talk more about it later. It was a site fence. There's an actual doctrine for things that are put up just to mess over your neighbor. And you can't do that. It's a spike fence, so they say you can't do that. You've got to take it down. But they said if for some reason later on they have a legitimate genuine use for that airspace, then they might be allowed to do that. So conceivably like if they want to put up a tall apartment building or something there, you know, if the neighborhood started getting more popular because, hey, there's an airport nearby and so people are moving in because it's really convenient and your time makes sense to put up like a 20 story apartment building, uh, the court might have allowed that, right, but this, no, you're not gonna get away with because it's being done in bad faith. Um, by the way, this is my, I think this is the peak of my academic career career, um, is is that that a bunch of that is mentioned in a casebook note there, uh. Um, I'm the guy who found that case and got it in the casebook there. I know Henry Smith. I also know Tom Merrill, um, but, um, and, uh, the reason why I mentioned this to you, aside from the fact that I'm, uh, desperately seeking, uh, greater prestige here by having gotten a note in a casebook is. It was seriously one of the most exciting moments of my really dull academic life. um, when I was in my office and I and I found that case because the case is not in Westlaw and it's not in Lexus. It's a reported case in the US Aviation Reports. And it isn't in either of those two databases. I had always assumed that basically everything is in Westlaw or in Lexus. Um, it's not. So just an FYI, if you're litigating something and things are getting desperate, start like doing Google searches and stuff to see if maybe there was some of the, the US aviation reports is in Hain Online, so you can get it there on Hain Online. Start looking at other things because there may be there is some stuff that isn't in there. Also, not every. The Law Review article is in Westlaw or Lexus. Uh, the most recent thing that I that I published, and don't ask me when because I am incredibly embarrassed that I've not been publishing, uh, since, working on things just really slow. Um, the, uh, uh, yeah, I, I, it was a symposium piece. I agreed to do it and I found out later, oh yeah, it's not on Westlaw, it's not on Lexus either, so like nobody will ever find it, but there you go. All right, so just be aware that there are those two databases are big but they don't have everything. All right, um, so that's Hinman. Uh, all right, any questions on that? OK, so now let's start talking about another wrinkle in trespass law. So Suppose we've got a trespass that is not a solitary occurrence, as happened in Jacquephrey Steenberg Homes. Jacquesrey Steenberg Homes, one time crossing of the land to deliver a thing. What if we have trespass that's a multiple time thing. Alright, uh, happens repeatedly, as would have been the case in Hinman. If Hinman had actually been a trespass, right, it wasn't, but if it had been a trespass, he would have had planes flying there repeatedly, and that would have been a repeated trespass. That's Baker versus Howard County hunt, and you know what, let's let's let's take a break. Uh, it's almost, uh, almost an hour. We'll take a break, we'll come back and we'll do Baker. Thank you, thank you, you know. I apologize about the Oh, I'm just trying to get cut. OK, yeah, yeah, you know, it occurred to me I probably should just also just take a look at them early and lonely if I have, if I have amendments to make on like I. I'm just gonna edit that. I'm just gonna edit the message, um, and but like I can probably, I should probably try to send you guys edits in advance too. I'm saying like what's the, what is the weirdest I can say. Yeah, so what, so what's the latest you need to get them back from here. Oh, so well, like when's the, when's the TA session. What is Gla 6 p.m. on. Yeah. I. No. that's. Oh right, well, all right, so. don't know. Don't know. How you doing. Yeah, I might have edited but anyway just before I I don't even know what I'll get it right, um, so I'm if you can like get on. I think it's. But I think For you. But like last week. I. I'm going outside. Hey, go over the slides and like send you some edits in advance. Um, that first batch of slides, I was like, I'm looking at that. I'm like, yeah, I would've done some stuff different. Um, that's not on you. That's like, that's on you. it was it was it's. Yeah for this on Wednesday when I was. I was helping out. So there's stuff here. Yeah, I'm like, I know. Yeah, I. Yeah Professors, yeah, they were, yeah, they were throwing, yeah, they were, yeah, they were using. They're being recycled from a different professor for a different course and then trying to sort of modify them for this, um, so I, I need to do more polishing on that, um, this, this week it doesn't matter like I, I do have meetings, yeah, so if you, if you can get it to me before the, the session, great. If not, we're not gonna worry about it just before it gets posted, let, let me. Yeah, that's, that's fine. No, it wasn't. Yeah OK, yeah OK amazing thank you so much. Do you ever feel like I said that's the same. Yeah. Wow, I never would have worked there. Yeah As he sees. Yeah. Certainly, certainly. Um Yeah, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna flame like a little bit. Do you know about? It's it. I know. more. What Aurora, the make up. Why would you assume he was Jewish? I was always gay. I mean he could be he felt so familiar. Wait, really? No way. It says it on the and I like clicked on it. Thanks. Yeah. Council It's Oh OK, so it's the brands. I'm not certain food. I, yeah, you're gonna. We don't know. Are you. I'm such a hypocrite though, because I want everybody else to put some nosy. I want to see if I get a good. Oh yeah. I'm not allowed to post about. Careful what you Or I, I can't put it on my lips in my head, but now I know. That maybe that's why I haven't seen it, or maybe people don't want to share that they're going. I've seen I've seen. I was like. You. What She likes it. OK. You feel something weird to me about it just because I'm not gonna work there for like what am I gonna post like, oh, like everybody else I know is gonna be like what. I like. Yeah No. But that I was. Yeah. Somebody showed me the one that was like. I accepted and it like jumped up higher. Yeah, no, I just saw this. Um. I I don't think I could do for like I think I got a little too. about. Yeah. I'm. Yeah. And I have a big group, guys. Yeah Is. Yeah. I. 5. I. OK, well Yeah. I. or would be in this hypothetical world where we didn't solve problems. That I know you can't talk. Is. Yeah. Wow. I. I the other ones like if they're in your garden. Sorry, I. I page. But I am. Hey by Wednesday at 6 and you can sue me. I saw that. It's like 250. I don't know if people that sweat. her birthday. I. I. We are uh. So it's really tough. I I don't think trespassing or something like that. like there's already like several cases. they just go super high. Like But it's look, if someone wants to come into your life. Sorry. So like. I Trespassing laws. It's just. Yeah. OK, folks, let's get back on this here. So what happens if we have repeated trespasses? This is Baker versus Howard County hunt. Intermediate Maryland appellate court, same year as him, 1936, page 417. Baker seeks an injunction to stop repeated trespasses on his land by fox hunters and their dogs, mainly the dogs. Alleges that they had been disturbing his animal experiments on rabbits and chickens. Apparently he was conducting experiments on a balanced diet. I don't know if that's a balanced diet for rabbits and chickens or a balanced diet of one half rabbit and one half chicken, but either way it's some sort of diet thing. He's doing some experiments there. The timeline for this 1924, Baker purchases the farm. Eventually he raises some animals. Six years later, 1930, the Hunt Club is formed. Baker initially doesn't worry because he doesn't have many animals. Um, 1932, 2 years later, Baker starts living on the farm permanently. A year later, Baker now has many rabbits. They've been breeding like, well, rabbits, so he's now got many rabbits, and the hunt club dogs get at them, and the hunt club dogs also bite Mrs. Baker, so Mrs. Baker is bitten as well. Three years later, I guess this has been going on for a while, in 1936, Mr. Baker shoots some of the trespassing dogs because he said he thought they threatened his chickens. Threatened Mrs. Baker too, maybe. I don't know, but he's concerned about the chickens, definitely, definitely worried about the chickens. Um, that same year in 1936, he then brings a suit seeking an injunction. The court's statement of the issue is whether equity may afford injunctive relief against a series of trespasses which, while not continuous, are nevertheless part of a single course of conduct which seriously interferes with the right of the landowner to the peaceful enjoyment of his property. This is once again another example of the distinction between continuous and continual that we've talked about in the past here, so we have something that's going on that's not continuous, it's not happening 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, but it's happening over and over and over again. And it is part of a single course of conduct that is a serious interference with the landowner's peaceful enjoyment. And so does Baker get injunctive relief here? So there's two issues. One is, does Baker get any relief at all? Is Baker entitled to any relief? And if the answer to that is yes, then is it injunctive relief that he's entitled to? So with respect to the first thing, the first issue, the court says yes, Baker's entitled to some sort of relief, um, says that fox hunters have rights and then goes off on this very lyrical passage about, uh, the joys of fox hunting and how wonderful that is. Um, Judges from time to time indulge in their poetic instincts rarely to good effect, but that's the way it is, um, and so does that but then having said that. Say that fox hunters have an unquestionable right to indulge that inclination, but only so long as they do not permit it to interfere with the rights of others, unquote. So you can do fox hunts only as long as you don't infringe other people's rights. You have rights, but other people have rights too. And when those rights come into conflict, we're going to have to do something to sort them out, and the sorting principle here, the court says, is that the fox hunters' rights take second priority. They fade into the background. There can be no doubt that the rights of the fox hunter are subordinate to the rights of the landowner, and that if the hunter himself goes on the lands of another against the owner's will, he is a trespasser. All right, so we're going to say fox hunters, you got to take a backseat to landowners. Conflict between rights. Is not something that just arises in property law, right? It arises throughout the law arises in politics all over the place, right? Various entities, various people have various rights, and you can't satisfy all of them. So how are you going to sort that out? Major issue. All right, um, so the court says it's clear that if the fox hunters go on Baker's land without permission, they're trespassing. But the hunt club argued it's not really the hunters that are doing that, it's the hounds that are doing that. So does that make a difference? And the court then goes into a discussion of the common law of dogs, and much to your surprise, we're not going to go into that, right? So we did foxes, we did whales, and now we're animals out. So that's it. We're not going to do the common law of dogs, but the court concludes that the incursions were in fact trespasses. All right, so we now have some legally relevant facts. The court says hounds have repeatedly overrun Baker's property. They've done substantial injury in doing that. The defendants, the hunt clubs, made no serious effort to stop this, and the key thing that's a technical term, the meaning of which we'll get to in a moment, is that there's no adequate relief available from an action at law. All right, that sounds very illegal. So what's up with that? So the issue is going to be whether now that we know that Baker has a claim for some sort of relief, does Baker have a claim, uh viable claim for equitable relief? How many people here have done a law equity distinction? Most of you, but not all of you. All right, so I'll say a few words about this. This is badly oversimplified. All right, people laughing. I don't know why. Maybe it's just me. I don't know. It's like, what you tell me what's amusing. Oh, we. So you, you did, you did not, or did, you did. 00, you all did. OK. All right. So did you do it to, to an enormous like, did you have somebody who was like really into it? Some, yeah, professors like really into law equity distinction. Oh yeah, exactly. Did it surprise? OK, great. OK, so you, so you know all this stuff. All right, great. So that makes that makes it easy. Alright, so you know, alright, so I, we had a whole history of things, two separate court systems in England, and, uh, that then, uh, gets unified in the mid-19th century in the United States. We only have one court system. Most jurisdictions, not all, Delaware, obvious example, uh, of a, uh, one that we. Still have two separate court systems there, um, but, uh, so we have two separate court systems, so we don't have two separate court systems. We nevertheless have two separate bodies of law, so courts are sitting in law are sitting in equity and we have different rules for those and equity arose as an appeal to the conscience of the chancellor, right, and so we are having a, uh, um, a different set of arguments that are raised in courts of equity and courts of law that's sound and sort of fairness and greater flexibility in equity, but of course we have corresponding to that. Probably talked about Selman and the Chancellor's Foot and all this stuff, right? The concerns about, um, uh, unbridled judicial discretion, right, uh, when we have, uh, courts that are making judgments based on more fairness, so one of the equitable maxims that equity follows the law in order to try to avoid that. OK. So we have a claim here. That, um, Sounds in equity, right? Somebody wants an injunction, and so that's the most basic dirt simple oversimplified split between law and equity right is law gives you money damages, equity gives you injunctions. If you want equitable relief, if you want injunctive relief, you're seeking equitable remedy. If you want money damages, you're seeking a legal remedy that's oversimplified but for our purposes good enough. OK So they want an injunction, so that means equity. The court here states two of the traditional requirements for equitable relief probably familiar to you. One, there must be no adequate remedy in law. And 2, the plaintiff must have clean hands. Which means the plaintiff must not have engaged in sufficiently serious wrongdoing that is related to the specific dispute at hand. The fact that the defendant was the fact that the plaintiff was a complete schmuck in general is irrelevant. It's got to be wrongdoing. Clean, dirty hands arises only if the wrongdoing, the schmuckness, is directly related to the disputed. OK, so we've got two traditional requirements for equity here, um, and are they satisfied? So the defendant argues that the plaintiff lacked clean hands here, says that Baker's shooting the dogs was illegal. And the court rejects that argument. It says it concedes ordinarily you're not allowed to shoot trespassing dogs. Can't do that. OK, this relates to an issue we'll talk more about later, which is concerns about how you enforce. Your right to exclude and courts are nervous about allowing people to use self-help to enforce the right to exclude. Right, taking along your own ends bad. So ordinarily you're not allowed to shoot trespassing dogs. But the court says under the common law of property, an owner is allowed to kill trespassing dogs under certain circumstances. Oversimplifying basically if it's necessary for self defense. So the court says applying that rule to these facts, quote, it cannot be said that Baker's act in shooting the dogs was so tortious as to place him beyond the pale of equitable relief. So plaintiff's hands were clean enough. All right, so clean hands satisfied. How about the no adequate remedy at law? Was there an adequate remedy at law here? And the court says no for two reasons, each of which it appears the court thought would have been sufficient, but it turns out both were satisfied here. But neither one would have been good enough. So one of them is that Baker suffered injuries which were intangible and incapable of measurement. So injuries that are intangible and incapable of measurement. Why does that matter? Well, if you take remedies, you'll study a bunch of stuff on damages, and one of the principles of damages law is that courts is a thing often called the requirement of reasonable certainty. Courts will not award damages unless the amount, the precise dollar amount to award, can be known with reasonable certainty. If it can't figure out that number, it will say, you know what, you suffered a loss, but we can't figure out the right number to put on, so no damages for you. All right, so in this case, the court says the damages, the number, the specific number you have to award, um, is incapable of measurement. Injuries are intangible, so it lists what the injuries are. The experiments were disrupted. There was interference with using the land as an animal refuge, and the threat of more trespasses interfered with Baker's reasonable enjoyment. If you look at each of those, like how do you put an actual dollar value on it? Stop and think to yourself, you're on a jury. You've got to put a dollar value on it. You read the case. You've heard the facts. What is the precise dollar value to put on the disruption to Baker's experiments? I don't know. I mean, like, one thing that might be going on here is. Baker might be a crank, right? I mean, so these experiments may be basically worthless, right? So it's not you, OK, well, you know, potentially it's gonna turn to $3 billion industry or something like, no, he's just like he might be kind of a, you know. So you can't figure out what that number would that be. Interference with using land as an animal refuge, that's not something that really is a market price. There aren't a lot of people selling animal refuges refugees, refuges, jeez Louise, and probably especially not in 1936. How do you price that? And the threat of more trespasses interferes with reasonable enjoyment. That's a psychological harm, and courts are often reluctant to award damages for psychological harms because how do you put a dollar value on them. All very murky. OK, so the court says, look, that's reason enough to think that the legal remedy by which has meant money damages is not going to be. The court gives that an independent reason, which almost certainly you talked about in Cipro, which is that here the defendants manifested an intention to persist with their actions. Hong Kong was going to keep hunting foxes as a result. If Baker were limited to damages, what would happen? Well, Baker could sue when they came on and like ate his chickens and stuff, and he could go to court and sue for damages. And then the next time they came on the land and did that, they could come in and sue for damages. And then when it happened again, he comes in and sue for damages. But every time they do that, he's going to go to freaking court and sue for damages. That is extremely burdensome. It takes a lot of his time. It takes a lot of effort. It takes a lot of money. Lawyers get paid. Right, this is very, very expensive and probably for each one of those injuries. The cost of litigating is probably greater than the actual damage that's being inflicted. They killed 3 chickens. What's the market value of 3 chickens? Not much. What's the market value of a lawyer's time? Even in 1936, a lot more than the chickens. All right, so as a result. If you said all he could get was money damages, he would get nothing, right? Money damages isn't going to work. Something the court didn't really mention here but is often also raised in this context is concerns about protecting courts. Courts don't want to have to deal with this stuff over and over and over again. All right, this may relate to what we saw in Pearson against Post, our very first case, right, where the court, uh, expressed concern about avoiding fertile sources of quarrels, right, we want to cut down on that, so we don't want to end this. Now based on Jacquere Steinberg homes. You might have wondered whether there might nevertheless have been an adequate remedy at law here if you had um awarded nominal damages. In compensation cause you don't I can't actually figure out what the number is and then awarded a large amount of punitive damages. Right, uh, so let's give a bunch of punitives, and that might deter. Um, and maybe it would, but you could see a problem with doing that, which is how do you figure out what the right level of punitive is to deter the hunt club. I mean, what's the number? I mean, think about it. Like, say you got to write down a number now. Suppose your grade in property depends upon coming up with the correct number for the punitive damages. It doesn't, but suppose it did, right? The correct number for punitive damages for you. Uh, how would you even do that? Like, hard to know. Right, so probably if you wanna stop the hunt club from doing this, the best way of doing it is just issue an injunction saying you can't do it. Just deter them directly. Now Uh I'm not sure why I said that. Let's see here, ah. Now one thing you might then think, OK, well if you're going to issue an injunction, now that we got an injunctions on the table, why, why not have an injunction in Jacque these Steenberg homes and there's just, just to finish up this, you know, thought, the possibilities here, right? Why not use an injunction there? Why use punitive damages in that case, which we saw some concern about the dollar value on the punitive damages. Maybe that's unfair, right? One of the weird things about punitive damages is that most jurisdictions they are paid to the plaintiff rather than say to the state. So in Jacques v. Steinberg Homes, the Jacques suffer $1 nominal damage, $1 actual injury, which means probably zero actual injury, and end up with $100,000 extra in the bank, huge windfall. Wow, that's pretty weird. Maybe that's not so good. Ah, maybe use an injunction. Well, the injunction is not gonna work there because They've already delivered the mobile. So the mobile home's already gone, right? You can't issue an order saying go back in time and don't deliver the mobile home across your property. Um, and so if you're just trying to defer deter Steenberg Homes, it's pointless, and you can't deter anybody else by doing it because again this is probably something you talked about in CI. Equity acts in personam, right, so injunctions are in personam. They are directed at one particular individual telling that one particular individual to do X or not do Y. Doesn't apply to anybody else, so you're not deterring anybody else from doing any actual trespassing there and delivering mobile homes and things like that because it it would just be an injunction against Steenberg Homes for basically delivering property across the Jacques land and that's never going to happen again. All right, so that's why that works out the way. OK, any questions on this? Fairly straightforward doctrinal, nothing particularly challenging theoretically here as long as you buy equity as a. Valid part of our legal system. How many people here when you learned about equity thought, oh, that's really cool, equity is really interesting. How many of you are like maybe we can get through and maybe not. Michael, it's like, OK, yeah, so equity is kind of, kind of having a moment in the academic world. Uh, it's, it's kind of coming back. Uh, the, um, there's a guy, Sam Bray, who is the, I, I, I think of him as young, but he's actually not so young anymore. He's, but he's the hotshot who, uh, started at UCLA and then went to Notre Dame and I think University of Chicago just bought him out, um, he's now at UFC, um, that, uh, uh, he um. Uh, he's written a lot on equity. He's one of the leading folks in bringing, like doing really scholarly takes on equity. Somebody else who's written an influential paper on equity is Smith of Merrill Smith and Brady. Henry Smith has a paper Equity is Meta Law, and, uh, he's really in equity lately. So you're getting the 4th edition has more equity worked into it than the previous editions, uh, did. So if you're in equity, you're like, yeah, you, uh, you've shown up in the law at the right time. OK. So that was continual trespasses, repeated trespasses, trespasses that happen over and over. But are not happening 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What if you have a trespass that's happening 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, right? A continuing trespass. It's not something that happens at discreet intervals, but something that's just continuous. Um, that's Pyle v. Pedrick and Golden Press versus Rylands. These are nice, a nice pair of cases because we have two cases with basically identical facts, facts that are as similar to each other as you could ever hope to get. And two courts reaching completely opposite conclusions when presented with the same facts. So Pyle v. Pendrick, first of our two cases, Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, 1895, page 433. Pedrick built a factory with a foundation, subterranean foundation. There was a mess up. I built the factory right along the edge of the property line with piles of property in order to figure out where the property line was, brought in the district surveyor to figure that out. And so the surveyor did, said, Here's where the property line was, but the surveyor messed up. As a result, the foundation ended up being 1 and 3/8 inches across the property line onto Pile's property, or I guess beneath Pile's property because it was a subterranean foundation. All right, tiny encroachment there. So Uh, that problem is not discovered until after the foundation has been poured and after Pedrick has put up a wall, put up a big factory wall on the foundation right along that property line edge. At some point it then gets discovered. And uh Pyle confronts Patrick about it and Patrick says, OK, all right, our bad, our bad, we screwed up we got it. Tell you what we'll do, we will go onto your property, we will dig down. To where that foundation is, we will chip off the 1 3/8 inches of encroachment. We will remove that. We will then fill in the dirt and we will restore everything to exactly the way it was before we got on there, and that will take care of the problem. But Pyle said no. No, because that means you are going to go onto our property, onto my property to do that. Don't want you to do that. No, why not? What reason does Pyle give according to the court? None whatsoever. Uh, it doesn't say anything. Uh, case doesn't say. Um, Pyle then, according to the court, seeks an injunction requiring Pedrick to remove the foundation, the encroachment, encroaching bit from Pedrick's side of the property. Which means that Patrick's gonna have to knock down the wall. Dig out the foundation from Pedrick's side and then Pedrick can like reach across and dig out the 1 and 3/8 inches of concrete that have gone across or a stone or whatever it was. Um, So that's what Pyle has asked for. The court says there are two possible remedies here actually that Pyle could have asked for. One possibility is just to treat the foundation, the encroachment, as a permanent trespass and to say, OK, it's a permanent trespass, and so we're going to award permanent damages for that. We're going to award some damages amount one, you know, it's a one lump sum thing that's going to completely compensate you for the value of having lost 1 and 3/8 inches of your subterranean stuff there, OK, could have done that. Or alternatively, The Court says Pao could ask for the injunction. Requiring the removal of the stones, the foundation from Patrick's side and chose to chose to do that. They chose that, OK. All right, so that's the setup, and then we have two judicial proceedings that are reported to us here, um, the first and the second. The first one, the court says the main issue here is costs, and by costs do not be confused about what they're talking about. Cost is just court costs, filing fees. All right, so the issue is who would be required to pay the costs of the litigation. That's not the cost of knocking on the wall and digging out the foundation. It's just the cost, the plaintiff's cost of going into court and filing the lawsuit, and the lower court had said that uh the plaintiff should be obligated to pay that, which is the default rule in America, right? You know this, right? Each party pays its own, uh, expenses and uh. Lower court had said yeah plaintiff should have to pay for that and um court here said yeah that's fine. Lower court has a discretion to dispose of that because he's fit and to exercise that and fine that is of no interest whatsoever to us um so there we have it it's like, OK, yeah that and then you got the second decision which is the interesting one or at least would have been the interesting one if it had been a bit longer. The issue is whether the lower court was correct in ordering the injunction, right, ordering the wall to be removed and the foundation to be chipped out from Pendrick's side, right? That's the striking order and that's the interesting issue, and the court affirms the lower court. So the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania says lower court got it right. But it's a pretty drastic remedy there, right, uh, it's very, very burdensome on Pedrick. Supreme Court of Pennsylvania says no that's OK, uh, that's appropriate award. What was the court's reasoning for this? that would be the interesting part here and. Well, they don't tell us quite as much perhaps as uh we might have wished. The court explains its reasoning as follows, quote, We do not see how the court below could have done otherwise. Unquote. OK, well, there you have it. It's the couldn't have done otherwise doctrine. If you know the lower court couldn't have done otherwise, then, then all right, we just affirm. Feel free to use that in law or anywhere else. Um, uh, why couldn't they have done otherwise? I mean, it seems a little, seems a little weird here, right? We've got this very drastic. remedy that's been awarded and we've got a decision that tells us less than we might have hoped about that. The authors of the case book. Make a yeoman's effort at trying to give a justification for this, um, and we'll give them prompts for trying. It's on, I believe, page 438 of the casebook. I am not persuaded at all by this, but then I have very strange views about Pyle v. Becker. A case which Henry Smith has said that I'm obsessed with and he is not entirely wrong, um, OK, so the, um, Doctrinal justification that the casebook authors try to come up with is this. The initial encroachment was just an accident, right? They, they got the local surveyor, came in. Did the job was reasonable to rely on that and then it turns out they made a mistake and so, OK, in. But once it was discovered that the line was placed in the wrong place, as the foundation had crossed the property line, once that was discovered, the continuation of that trespass became an intentional trespass. You know what you're doing. You're still doing it. You could stop. It would be very expensive to stop, but you could, and you're not. You're still doing it. That's an intentional trespass. And we saw that in Jacques Chris Steinberg homes, intentional trespasses are forbidden, whether or not the exclusion is reasonable. Steenberg Homes knew what they were doing when they cut across Jacques's property without permission, and the Jacques may have been completely unreasonable in wanting to stop them from doing that. Doesn't matter. You get to stop that. All right, um, so, uh, and in Jack Steinberg Holmes. The encroachment was completely harmless and you still got to stop it. So the fact that here the encroachment seems de minimis. Still get to stop it. All right, so there's, there's the justification, and if you say it quickly enough, it almost sounds plausible. But there's a problem. Uh, somebody guess what the problem is. I bet you flinched. That's all right. I'm wrong 33 times a day, and I try to limit to only 3 or 4 times in this classroom, so it's uh. I, I guess. Like. No, it's, it's not right. It's not right because I was going to say something about bad faith, but trespass is just, it's like a, uh, let's see here, is it, uh, Mr. Mr. Abu Aborazad, how is it? The Borde, yeah. Um, I think the issue with that comes down to the fact that if you follow the rules strictly and like if there's an encroachment and then they ultimately have to, I guess, remove everything that they've placed past the boundary lines, then you have a lot of like dead weight loss, like a lot of energy went into creating that or making the structure and now they have to put up a lot of time and effort and resources into removing. All the work that they put into it, um, and that can just create more cost down the line. All right, so it is, I think I don't think that's quite what I was looking for, but it's related to what I'm looking for all right, so we've got I'll take it big social costs here, all right, so you know, so all right, so this is, so we got big social costs here so this should strike you as weird, right? This decision should strike you as wow, that's kind of like. Kind of wild what happened here. All right, um, and so I'll go one other person take a, take a stab at oh, I saw another hand. Oh, got multiple hands here. Uh, is it Mr. Bao? Yeah, I think the idea is that we, we are enforcing an injunction to the minimum benefit of the plaintiff but to the maximum cost to the, uh, defendant, and that offends the idea of equity equitable relief which is to balance the interests of, of both parties and enforce fairness is that. Golden Press versus Ryland's is going to get to that. We're going to get to the balancing of the hardships, and that appears to be not happening here whatsoever. The undue burden thing, balancing the hardships not going on. That's a little weird. What's up with that? It's again kind of getting kind of circulating circulating circling around this. We will give, uh, is it Ms. Debtor. It's Dieterer Dieter, yeah, and one of the fascinating things about this fantastic piece of paper here is that pencils are. Utterly useless on it. It came out like it's, uh, like there's lit it's amazing like literally it is impervious to pencil. They've got some sort of special nano coating on this thing, so we'll have to try to figure it out later. OK, Ms. Dier, I'm also not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I think the fact pattern suggests that like the plaintiff wouldn't let the defendant onto his land to remove the foundation, so like. There wasn't an opportunity for the defendant to rectify the tre. It's not like he wasn't intending to continue to trespass like he attempted, attempted to stop his continuous trespass by removing that part of the foundation and was denied that likeability. OK, that was not quite what I'm looking for, but it's still related to it. So I'm sort of circling around it, which is good, right? Um, so basically I think one reason why people weren't getting it is because what I had in mind was like really simple minded, like really easy, right? And so yeah, all right, go ahead.

SPEAKER 3
I hope that this is right. Is it no adequate remedy at law? There is like an adequate remedy at law which is to just pay them off.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, so the, the issue is, right, so the argument that the casebook gives establishes, oh, we got an intentional trespass and so therefore you've got a right, you know, you've got a remedy against, uh, what happened here even if it's completely unreasonable, but it doesn't tell us what remedy. That you should get right? And so you might be concerned about issuing an injunctive remedy here because social cost is high, right, because there might be an adequate remedy at law, because there could be something else you could issue an injunction that would say you've got to remove the thing, you got to remove the. Uh, the stones, but you can go onto Pyle's property to do that. That's a different injunction that could have been issued. So there's a bunch of, there's a whole spectrum of remedial options that the court could have chosen among, and it didn't, and that's the real question of what's going on here. Like that's what's weird about this case, not that there's some liability, yeah, somebody built across the property line. Um, the question is why is it that this extreme remedy. is being granted here. Right, that's the weird thing. So that's why I think that the, uh, casebook example doesn't, uh, casebook argument doesn't work at all, right? It does, it doesn't answer the question, uh, that we're trying to, uh, actually sort out. Um All right, let's talk, we've already touched upon it, so yeah, let's talk about Golden Press versus Rylands, um. I will note, I don't think we're gonna have time to get into it and you probably aren't going to care anyway. I am mildly obsessed with this case. I, I, I have to next time I'm in Philly, and I'm rarely in Philly, I, I got to actually go see the building. The building's still standing. I've done Google Maps Street View on this stuff and so forth, and I have a little theory on this. Uh, Henry Smith and I were going to write a paper about it, uh, over the summer. We just didn't get around to it, get to it at some point. Basically everything I've told you about Pyle v. Pedrick is 100% true. And 100% misleading. Uh, it's like it's not about anything that it seems there. It's completely different, um, but, uh, yeah, whatever, it's a good companion case here, the Golden Press versus Rylands. I'll just leave you with one of the things that like made me realize, wait a minute, there's something off here. When I realized that the person that so. Pyle v. Pedrick Who wins Pyle v. Pedrick here? Just, just like Would you say it's a major victory or a minor victory? How many people think this is a pretty big win for Pyle? people think it's a small win for Pyle. Why do you think it's a small win? Why, why smile? Um, are, are you looking at me? Maybe? hello, um. Uh, I think it's a small one because it's like 1 and 3/4 of his property. It's, it's like a, sorry, 1 inch and 3/4 of his property. Am I right about how much that is? Like, it just seems like not like, OK, now it's removed, but you never really experienced that infringement anyway. So we'll bracket that thought because we'll get back to that with Golden Press versus Rollins. All right, so great thought. We'll just bracket that, yeah.

SPEAKER 4
Uh, I feel like it's a big win for Pile because it kind of vindicates their pettiness because now the other side has to like dig all the way through their factory just to remove a couple of inches. So like, yeah.

SPEAKER 0
All right, so, OK, so maybe vindicates the pettiness. We'll give, uh, Ms. Ruben, yeah, all right, last one. Yeah, I also think that he might have had other intentions. It sounds like it was a factory right next to his property, and I think he's less concerned about maybe the inch that encroached on his property and more just trying to find a way to get rid of that factory, and he was successful. Yeah, so it wasn't successful actually. The factory is there, but you're right. So actually you're on the right track. What's going on in the case, right? But, uh, yeah, oh sorry, wait, what? So what ended up happening then? I thought he was able, he did get the injunction in, uh, so he gets the injunction, but we'll talk about, we'll talk about that when we talk about Gro Bloom Press versus Rylands. What happens next, right? So, so, uh, it turns out that there usually is, we don't actually know, but I, I, you can see the factory. Uh, it's, uh, it's still standing, um, so you can see, so the factory ended up being there. I originally thought that he was trying to kill the factory too, but that actually is not, I think, what's, what's going on, um, uh, but we'll talk about, uh, it's getting to something important we'll talk about when we get to through Golden Press versus Rylands. I only have time to start it, but, uh, we'll, uh, I, uh, get to, uh, that sort of the start of the next class. OK, so Golden Press versus Rylands, same facts. So we have now, we're now in Colorado. It's now 1951, so we're a half century later. We're halfway across the continent, half a century later, uh, page 435. Facts are virtually identical. Here we have a factory foundation that's 2 to 3.5 inches across the property line, and we have a wall 100 ft 180 ft 160 ft long, built on top of the foundation. All right, so same setup, lawsuit seeks an injunction. Court says no injunction. Says the plaintiff can seek money damages back in lower court if they want to, but they can't get an injunction. And the court then in dicta guesstimates what it thinks the money damages might be. It says you can sue for this if you want to. What do they say it would be? I realized you were all in not doing anything in law school now except interviewing for jobs and things like that. That's, uh, so I, I realized that this might be a slightly arcane question, but there we are. I'm gonna ask it anyway. Uh Yeah. Yes, $55. Now you adjust that for inflation. And in today's money it's approximately $700. So say if you want, you can sue and you'll get in today's money $700. Are they going to sue for $700? No, of course you don't sue for 700 bucks. Maybe you could bring, like, I actually don't know if you can bring property claims in small claims claims court at all. I don't know anything about how small claims court works, but maybe you could get that there. Maybe it wouldn't, then you're not represented and so you don't have to pay the lawyers. Maybe it might make some sense, but you're not going to do that. All right, so you're not going to bring up. All right, um, why is this? Well, the court's discussion of willfulness here is central, central, says that if there's good faith by the defendant, then, quote, the court should not become a party to extortion. Unquote All right, the court here is concerned about relative bargaining power, and the reason why the court is concerned is because a lawsuit does not end a dispute. The lawsuit, the lawsuit is a chapter in a story. There are subsequent chapters. What happens after the courts have settled who has what entitlement is it may be that the party that's given the entitlement places a value of $1000 on the entitlement. And the party that was denied the entitlement places a value of $75,000 on the entitlement. All right, what happens next? Well, likely at that point, the parties will engage in post-judgment bargaining. One party places a $75,000 value on it but doesn't have it. The other party places a $1000 value on it and does have it. It would make sense for the party that has it and places a lower value on it to sell it to the party that doesn't have it and place a higher value on it. They are likely to have the interest change hands. Um, and, uh, for some money to change hands, but the price at which that changed hands, changes hands depends upon what the court had ordered. Bargaining occurs in the shadow of the law. If the court had said that the party who placed a $75,000 value on the entitlement is entitled to it. Then they would just have it and they wouldn't pay any money to the other party, right? The party that places the $1000 value on it, if they're given the entitlement, they're going to be willing to sell it for at least $1000 less than $1000 they're not going to give it up. But they may try to hold out for up to $75,000. The party that places a $75,000 value on it, they're willing to pay maybe close to $75,000 in order to get the thing. That gives enormous leverage to the party that only placed a $1000 value on the entitlement. And you might worry that that is unfair, that then enables that party to extort, if you don't like what's going on, $62,000 from the other party. Doesn't seem so good. All right, um, the court here seemed to suspect that extortion might have been in play. It noted the plaintiffs were aware of the construction but took no steps for injunction or other legal determination of the disputed line until after both the foundation and the upper wall were completed. So they sat around, waited until the neighbor was really vulnerable. And then brought the suit, so the court's worried about giving that excessively large bargaining power because basically if they give an injunction there, then the factory builder is gonna have to tear down the wall and dig out the foundation super expensive. They're probably going to be willing to pay a lot of money to avoid having to do that. And why is it fair that the neighbor should get that? So the court says we don't want to be party to extortion. So we're not gonna do, we're uh not gonna issue that if the encroachment was in good faith. And the court says if the encroachment was in bad faith, then equity may well require its restoration regardless of the expense of removal as compared with the damage suffered therefrom. So if you just knew that it wasn't your property and you just built there anyway, they may issue the injunction and make you pull that out. That's not unfair, you know, you can't just like otherwise the concern is otherwise you could just force other people to sell you their property. By building there and then getting permanent damages for the price of it, it's like that's not good. So if you do it in bad faith then. You can't do that, but the court says the assumption, the default assumption is that it was done in good faith and there's no contrary evidence provided here, so we don't know that. All right, um, when we come back next time, we will finish up this case with, uh, they state a general principle and we'll sort of stay with the general principle is and how that applies and then we'll.
