tragedy of commons.

- party chooses option that benefits themselves (internal) but not external effects. 
	- ranchers cannot internalize the benefits from refraining from over-grazing.
	- should they just plant more grass? its costly.
	- the cost of planting it internalized by the planter, but then anybody else can come along to benefit from it. hence, planting grass is a losing proposition and refraining is losing. 
	- result: all grass is eaten and there is no grass left.

Knowledge problem:
	F.a. hayak. use of knowledge in society.
		- central planners cannot have enough information to make optimal decisions. 
		- see corp. central planning: 
			- microsoft, bill gates was 'paranoid' that microsoft will go extinct. they have all incentive to 'know the future'.jan 2007: iphone revealed. april 2007: steve palmer (microsoft): there is no chance iphone will get any amount of market share.
			- there is no way to aggregate all the relevent information in a way that a central planner can make teh optimal decision.
- solution?
	- private property. if rancher owns their own plot, they compete against nature rather than each other; they seek to make the land as productive as possible.
	- benefits and costs are internalized.
		- new need: 
			- need fences and enforcement to protect from outsiders.
			- if your plot happens to not get enough rain you're stuck even if the neighboring plot got lots of rain and lots of grass that could go to waste
			- Solution: markets (to transfer grass to those that need it) insurance (each person pays into fund and the fund pays for any individual that got too little rain)
			- New institutions (markets and insurance) require more upkeep with more enforcement.
			- common ownership vs private plus markets and insurance noen are definitely better than other.
		- another option is mob rule> instead of having police,  parties can enforce themselves, if someone grazes or fishes where there;s not allowed to the participants can enforce hte rule themselevs.
	- Michael Heller: anti-commons:
		- problem with too much ownership. too many parties with veto rights leads to resource under-utilization. (in contrast with tragedy of commons that leads to rsource over-utlization)
	- sum: property = an institution. 


Water:
- defined channel (stream) and diffuse (floodwater).
- former is a resource, latter is a pest to be eradicated.
- riparian = someone that owns land adjacent river stream (if lake: littoral)
- apurtenant =

Natural flow:
- may use water if it does not interrupt the flow.
- transaction costs of negotiating with donwnstream riparians.
- holdout problem: one party can refuse to give permission even if everyone else did. strategic holdout may charge exorbitant fees. result is water can go unused.
- American property law favors resource utilization.

Evans rule: "reasonable use": riparian allowed 'reasonable use'.
- reasonable is determined by government. 
	- problem: uncertain: 
		- what's reasonable use- what will judge or jury say?
		- reasonable changes over time.
First acquisition: whoever gets ther first can keep the water right
- certain. does not change over time.
	- problem: not always obvious who was there first.

Evans v. Merriweather (1842) :
 s and b first possessor, sells to merrywather, evans is upstream and builds a damn.
 - according to Egalitarian Natural flow: whos first possesor? arguably any one of them could potentially be first. Evans firts possensed this particualr water. but s and b was first to use the stream. and sold to M who perhaps purchased s and b's right?
 - according to Reasonable use:
	 - riparian may use the water if its reasonable and the water is not more than necessary for that use.
	 - reasonable = natural wants (personal use that can't be fulfilled otherwise). artifical wants (to profit) = unreasonable. 
	 - Natural Want always trumps artificial wants. natural is context dependent. 
	 - **if artifical want, its never okay to use all the water. (important)

	Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Company
		note: whats considerd 'non-beneficial'? using water to shoo gophers away (note in casebook) meryl reacts to this that its not very beneficial.
