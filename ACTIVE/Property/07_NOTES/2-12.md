ex ante, a forgiving court disincentivizes builders from being careful.
but ex post, a strict court that allows injunctive relief for small encroachments would be overly wasteful.

self-help:
allowed if peacable.

new rule: 
risk of violence is nonpeacable; otherwise, lessees will have an incentive to spark violence. administribility makes a bright line rule preferable.

some courts (not Minnesota) allow self-help in commercial dispute.

movable property allows for self-help; UCC allows for peacable self-help (ex post analysis) and no court order required.

Berg: there was no confrontation, yet court disallows self-help for ex ante considerations.
Williams; there was a (peaceful) confrontation yet court allowed self-help
