# TORTS PRE-CLASS WORKFLOW [HUANG EDITION]

**Updated:** 2026-01-29  
**Purpose:** Prepare for Huang's fact-heavy, argument-focused Socratic method

**Philosophy:** Huang uses cases for FACTS, not law. Your prep must focus on fact manipulation and both-sides argumentation.

---

## Huang's Teaching Pattern (Verified from Transcripts)

### What Huang Does in Class

1. **Reads cases for facts only** - "Why are we reading this? For the facts."
2. **Asks you to argue BOTH sides** - "Now argue the opposite"
3. **Focuses on untaken precautions** - "What else could they have done?"
4. **Pushes on fact variations** - "What if the pier was 4 feet tall instead?"
5. **Jury instructions matter** - He reads them aloud, you need to reference them
6. **Common sense arguments** - "You're arguing to aunt and uncle on the jury"

### What Gets Rewarded

- **Both-sides argumentation** (plaintiff → defense → back to plaintiff)
- **Identifying untaken precautions** with cost-benefit analysis
- **Fact manipulation** - changing one fact to change outcome
- **"What more facts would we want?"** - discovery thinking
- **Using jury instruction language** - "reasonable person under circumstances"

### What Doesn't Matter

- ❌ Cardozo's reasoning (unless he explicitly says to focus on it)
- ❌ Procedural history
- ❌ Detailed case holding (he wants the fact pattern)
- ❌ Abstract doctrine (that's for the TA review slides)

## Minimum Viable Prep (20-25 min)

### Goal

Produce **TWO prep documents** for each class:

1. **Audio Prep** (4,000-5,000 words, ~25 min at 1.5x) - TTS-friendly, conversational
2. **Text Prep** (Q&A format, ~3,000 words) - In-class reference

Both should focus on **argumentation** not doctrine.

---

## Step 1: Gather Materials (3 min)

**Required inputs:**
- [ ] Syllabus reading assignment for this class
- [ ] Case readings from packet or Abraham book
- [ ] Illinois jury instructions (for negligence topics)
- [ ] Past exam questions (to see how Huang tests)

**Where to find:**
- Syllabus: `01_SOURCES/syllabus/Torts 2026 Prof Huang Syllabus.md`
- Course style guide: `00_ADMIN/course_style_guide.md`
- Past exams: `01_SOURCES/past_exams/` (read 2015-2018 Spring)

---

## Step 2: Generate Audio Prep (12-15 min prep time)

**File location:** `02_PREP/audio/YYYY-MM-DD_classNN_audio.md`

**Target:** 4,000-5,000 words (25-30 min listening at 1.5x)

### Required Sections

#### 1. WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY

```markdown
## What's Happening Today

Quick overview: We're covering [topic]. Huang will use [case names] as fact patterns, not for their legal holdings. He'll ask you to argue plaintiff side, then flip to defense.

**Cold call prep:**
- Be ready to identify untaken precautions
- Practice both-sides arguments
- Think about "what more facts would we want"
```

#### 2. THE FACT PATTERNS (Most Important)

```markdown
## The Fact Patterns

### [Case Name] - The Setup

Here's what happened: [Tell the story conversationally, like you're explaining to a friend]

**Key facts Huang will focus on:**
- [Fact 1] - This matters because [why]
- [Fact 2] - Huang will ask "what if this was different?"
- [Fact 3] - This is an untaken precaution

**What's weird/interesting about these facts:**
[Note anything that seems like a freak accident or highly unusual - Huang loves these]
```

#### 3. ARGUMENTS YOU'LL MAKE

```markdown
## Arguments You'll Be Making

### Plaintiff's Side (Why defendant should pay)

**Untaken precautions:**
1. [Precaution 1] - Cost: [low/high], Benefit: [would have prevented injury]
2. [Precaution 2] - Custom argument: everyone else does this
3. [Precaution 3] - Foreseeability: they should have seen this coming

**Use these phrases:**
- "A reasonable person would have..."
- "The burden was minimal compared to..."
- "This was foreseeable because..."

### Defense Side (Why defendant shouldn't pay / was reasonable)

**Counter-arguments:**
1. [Precaution 1] was unreasonably costly because...
2. The injury was unforeseeable because...
3. The plaintiff was comparatively negligent...

**Use these phrases:**
- "No reasonable person would have..."
- "The burden was prohibitive because..."
- "This was a freak accident that..."
```

#### 4. HUANG WILL PUSH ON THESE ISSUES

```markdown
## Where Huang Will Push You

**Fact variations:**
- "What if [X] was different?" - How does that change your argument?
- "What if we add this fact?" - Does it help plaintiff or defense?

**Cost-benefit tensions:**
- "Is that really worth it?" - Be ready to defend why precaution is/isn't worth cost
- "Who pays for that?" - Think about spreading costs

**Jury vs. Judge:**
- "Who decides this?" - Usually jury, but know when judge might take over
```

#### 5. POLICY CONNECTIONS (Brief)

```markdown
## Policy Context

**Aims of tort law here:**
- Deterrence: Making [defendant type] take more/less precautions
- Corrective justice: [Plaintiff] was wronged and deserves compensation

**Huang's likely take:**
[Based on course themes - he emphasizes deterrence/incentives over corrective justice]
```

#### 6. CONNECTIONS TO PREVIOUS CLASSES

```markdown
## How This Connects

**Last class we covered:** [Topic]
**This builds on it by:** [Connection]
**Next class we'll see:** [Where this leads]
```

## Step 3: Generate Text Prep (8-10 min prep time)

**File location:** `02_PREP/text/YYYY-MM-DD_classNN_text.md`

**Target:** Q&A format, ~3,000 words

### Required Sections

#### 1. QUICK NAVIGATION

```markdown
## QUICK NAVIGATION

**Today's Focus:** [1-sentence topic]

**Cases:** [List with page numbers]

**Key Jury Instructions:** [Relevant sections - e.g., Illinois 10.01, 10.02]

**Search Terms for In-Class Reference:** [Keywords to CTRL+F during class]
```

#### 2. CORE DOCTRINE (Minimal)

```markdown
## Core Doctrine

### Negligence Standard (for today's topic)

**Rule:** [Copy relevant jury instruction language]

**Elements:**
1. [Element 1]
2. [Element 2]
3. [Element 3]

[Keep this SHORT - this is backup, not primary focus]
```

#### 3. EXPECTED HUANG QUESTIONS (Primary Focus)

```markdown
## Expected Huang Questions

### Q: "What precautions weren't taken here?"

**A:** [List 3-5 untaken precautions]
- [Precaution 1]: Cost [low/high], Would have [prevented/reduced injury]
- [Precaution 2]: [Why defendant didn't do this]

### Q: "How would you argue for the plaintiff?"

**A:** [2-3 paragraph argument using facts]
- Reasonable person standard: [Application]
- Foreseeability: [Why defendant should have known]
- BPL analysis: Burden was X, Probability was Y, Loss was Z

### Q: "Now argue for the defense."

**A:** [2-3 paragraph counter-argument]
- No duty to prevent unforeseeable harm
- Precautions would have been prohibitively costly
- Plaintiff was comparatively negligent

### Q: "What if [FACT] was different?"

**A:** [How changing that fact changes outcome]
- If [fact change 1], then plaintiff wins because...
- If [fact change 2], then defense wins because...

### Q: "What more facts would you want to know?"

**A:** [Discovery-focused thinking]
- Did defendant know about [X]? This matters because...
- What was the industry custom? This affects...
- Were there prior similar incidents? Impacts foreseeability...
```

#### 4. CASE BRIEFS (Fact-focused)

```markdown
## Case Briefs

### [Case Name]

**WHY WE'RE READING THIS:** For the fact pattern, not the legal holding

**THE STORY:**
[3-4 sentences: what happened?]

**THE PARTIES:**
- Plaintiff: [who they are, why they're injured]
- Defendant: [who they are, what they did/didn't do]

**UNTAKEN PRECAUTIONS:**
1. [What defendant could have done]
2. [Another precaution]

**THE INJURY:**
[What happened, how bad was it]

**HUANG WILL FOCUS ON:**
[Which facts he'll manipulate, which arguments he'll push]

[Repeat for each case]
```

#### 5. POLICY TENSIONS

```markdown
## Policy Tensions

**Deterrence vs. Fairness:**
- Holding defendant liable: incentivizes [X]
- Not holding liable: means plaintiff bears loss

**Efficiency:**
- Cheapest cost avoider: [Who]
- Economic impact: [Analysis]

[Keep this brief - policy is ~20% of Huang's exam, not main focus in class]
```

#### 6. QUICK HYPOS (At Least 5)

```markdown
## Quick Hypos

### Hypo 1: [Case name variation]
**Facts:** [Change one key fact from actual case]
**Issue:** Does this change the outcome?

```

#### 7. SEARCH TERMS

```markdown
## Search Terms (for CTRL+F during class)

- reasonable person
- untaken precautions
- foreseeability
- custom
- BPL / Hand formula
- comparative negligence
- [Other key terms for today]
```

## Step 4: Update MASTER_LOG

**In `00_ADMIN/MASTER_LOG.md`:**

- [ ] Mark `Prep_Audio` as "Done"
- [ ] Mark `Prep_Text` as "Done"
- [ ] Update `Next_Action` to "Attend class"

## Audio Prep Guidelines

### Voice and Tone

**Conversational, like a study partner:**
- "Here's the thing about this case..."
- "Huang will definitely push you on..."
- "Be ready to argue both sides here..."
- "This is where it gets interesting..."

**Make predictions:**
- "I bet Huang will ask..."
- "Watch for him to say 'What if...' here"
- "This feels like an exam fact pattern"

**Give opinions on importance:**
- "This is crucial for the exam"
- "Don't spend too much time on this part"
- "Focus on these three precautions"

### What to Include

✅ Fact patterns told as stories
✅ Both-sides arguments (with transitions)
✅ Predictions about Huang's questions
✅ Connections between topics
✅ "Here's why this matters" explanations
✅ Exam relevance flags

### What to Exclude

❌ Verbatim rule statements (save for text prep)
❌ Detailed case briefs with citations
❌ Abstract policy discussions
❌ Procedural history

---

## Text Prep Guidelines

### Format: Q&A Structure

**Why Q&A?** Huang's Socratic method = you answering questions. Structure prep around his likely questions.

**Each Q&A should be:**
- Self-contained (can read one without reading all)
- Argument-focused (not just doctrine recitation)
- Both-sides (plaintiff → defense counter)
- Fact-specific (tied to today's cases)

### Quick Navigation Section

**Purpose:** Fast CTRL+F during class when you're called on

**Include:**
- Section headings as keywords
- Case names with page numbers  
- Key doctrine terms
- Jury instruction references

---

|----------|--------------|
| Brief cases traditionally | Extract fact patterns for arguments |
| Focus on Cardozo's reasoning | Focus on what precautions weren't taken |
| Memorize abstract rules | Practice arguing both sides |
| Predict the "right answer" | Prepare arguments for both outcomes |
| Ignore jury instructions | Reference them in your prep |
