# Torts Course Style Guide

**Purpose:** Course-specific writing standards, preferences, and conventions for Torts (Huang, Spring 2026).

---

## Course Overview

**Professor:** Huang
**Semester:** Spring 2026
**Exam Format:** Issue-spotter exam, open book

**Course Characteristics:**
- **Doctrine focus** - Intentional torts, negligence, strict liability
- **Policy emphasis** - Efficiency, fairness, social goals
- **Case depth** - Key cases for each doctrine
- **Exam approach** - Issue-spotting with rule application

---

## Course Priorities

### Doctrinal Focus

**Primary emphasis:**
1. **Elements of each tort** - Duty, breach, causation, damages
2. **Rule statements** - Complete, accurate, with all elements
3. **Case law** - Key holdings that establish rules
4. **Defenses** - Justifications and privileges

**Secondary emphasis:**
- Policy tensions (efficiency vs. fairness)
- Comparative analysis
- Hypothetical variations

**Exam weight:**
- Issue-spotting: ~80% (identify all torts and defenses)
- Policy discussion: ~20% (when explicitly required)

---

### Policy Weight

**Policy in class:** Moderate - Professor discusses policy but exam is doctrine-focused

**Policy on exam:** ~20% - Usually one section of essay requiring policy discussion

**Expected depth:**
- Understand major policy tensions (efficiency, fairness, deterrence)
- Apply policy when question explicitly asks
- Focus on doctrinal accuracy first, policy second

**Key policy themes:**
- Deterrence (specific vs. general)
- Loss distribution (insurance, liability)
- Economic efficiency
- Corrective justice
- Social goals (safety, innovation)

---

### Case Depth

**Case briefing expectations:** Medium - Focus on key cases that establish rules

**What to brief:**
- Landmark cases (Palsgraf, MacPherson, Rowland v. Christian)
- Cases that establish elements
- Cases with unique fact patterns
- Cases professor emphasizes in class

**What to summarize:**
- Illustrative cases (examples of established rules)
- Cases mentioned only in passing

**Dissent focus:** Not major - Only note if dissent creates alternative rule

---

## Prep Document Preferences

### Audio Prep Style

**Purpose:** TTS-friendly, conversational prep for listening before class

**Length:** 4,000-5,000 words (~25-30 minutes at 1.5x)

**Voice:**
- Conversational, like a study partner explaining to you
- Second person ("you'll learn," "have this ready")
- Use transitions: "Here's the thing...", "Now, here's where it gets interesting..."
- Give opinions on what's most important
- Make predictions about what Huang will focus on

**Content principles:**
- **Include:** Core concepts explained conversationally, key cases (facts + holding + why it matters), elements breakdown, cold-call prep, connections to previous/future classes
- **Exclude:** Verbatim rule statements (save for text prep), detailed case briefs (save for text prep), extensive footnotes

**Conversation techniques:**
- "Huang will likely push on..."
- "Be ready to argue both sides..."
- "Here's the thing about this doctrine..."
- "Let me give you an example..."

---

### Text Prep Style

**Purpose:** Comprehensive reference for in-class lookup

**Format:** Q&A format with expected questions and complete answers

**Required sections:**
- QUICK NAVIGATION
- CORE DOCTRINE (rule statements with elements)
- EXPECTED HUANG QUESTIONS (Q→A format)
- CASE BRIEFS (using standard format)
- POLICY (major tensions)
- QUICK HYPOS (≥5 with variations)
- SEARCH TERMS

**Case brief format:**
```markdown
## Case Name, [Citation] ([Year])

### Rule of Law
[One-sentence rule]

### Facts
1. [Key fact 1]
2. [Key fact 2]

### Issue
[Legal question]

### Holding & Reasoning
### ([Justice], J.)
[Yes/No]

1. [First point]
2. [Second point]

### Disposition
[Affirmed/Reversed/remanded]
```

**What to emphasize:**
- **Complete rule statements** - All elements numbered
- **Element definitions** - What each element means
- **Case holdings** - One sentence stating the rule
- **Hypotheticals** - Variations on fact patterns

**Hypo format:**
- Facts (1-2 sentences)
- Issue (which torts apply)
- Analysis (elements + application)
- Both-side arguments

---

## Exam Answer Style

### IRAC Structure

**I - Issue**
- Frame as: "Whether [plaintiff] can recover for [tort] against [defendant]"
- Identify all possible torts and defenses

**R - Rule**
- Complete rule statements with all elements numbered
- Include case names and holdings
- Define key terms on first use
- Cite Restatement (Second) of Torts when applicable

**A - Analysis**
- Apply each element sequentially
- Use "Here, [facts]... because [reasoning]"
- Consider all torts that could apply
- Discuss defenses
- Address counterarguments

**C - Conclusion**
- Direct answer for each tort/defense
- "Therefore, plaintiff CAN/CANNOT recover for [tort]"
- Follow logically from analysis

---

### Writing Style

**DO:**
- Use numbered elements (1, 2, 3...)
- Cite cases (e.g., "Under Palsgraf...")
- Include all relevant torts (not just most obvious)
- Discuss alternative theories
- Address defenses even if not explicitly asked
- Use policy when question requires it

**DON'T:**
- Miss non-obvious torts
- Skip defenses
- Ignore policy when explicitly requested
- Use case names without holdings
- Miss elements in analysis

---

### Formatting

- Use numbered lists for elements
- Use bold for key terms and holdings
- Include headings for each tort
- Use **bold** for emphasis

---

## Professor Patterns

### Typical Questions

**Socratic style:**
- Cold calls on specific students
- Follow-ups: "But what if..." "How does that change..." "Is that always true..."
- Pushes on element application
- Connects current doctrine to previous topics

**Patterns:**
- "What torts apply here?" (comprehensive issue-spotting)
- "What's the element for X?" (element knowledge)
- "How does this case change the rule?" (case law evolution)
- "What's the defense?" (defenses matter)

---

### What Gets Rewarded

**Analysis moves:**
- Comprehensive issue-spotting (find all torts)
- Complete element analysis
- Accurate rule statements
- Case application
- Policy sophistication (when asked)

**Exam patterns:**
- Multiple torts can apply to same facts
- Defenses are always tested
- Policy usually in one section
- Hypotheticals vary facts from key cases

---

### Exam Signals

**Phrases professor uses:**
- "This is important"
- "Note this distinction"
- "This will be on the exam"
- "Pay attention to this element"

**Patterns:**
- Spends 20+ minutes on one case → likely exam-heavy
- Repeats concept across multiple classes → recurring theme
- Uses hypothetical repeatedly → testable fact pattern

---

## Course-Specific Conventions

### Restatement Citation Style

**Restatement citations:**
- First mention: "Restatement (Second) of Torts § X"
- Subsequent: "§ X" or "the Restatement"

**Quoting Restatement:**
- Include text for key elements
- Reference comments when helpful

---

### Case Name Format

**Full citation first:** *Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R.*, 248 N.Y. 339 (1928)

**Short form thereafter:** Palsgraf

---

### Numbering and Formatting

**Elements:** Always number: 1, 2, 3...

**Tests:** Number factors: (1), (2), (3)...

**Rules:** Use bold for emphasis: ** duty**

---

## Content Guidelines

### What to Include in Prep Docs

**Doctrine:**
- Complete rule statements
- Element breakdown with definitions
- How to prove each element
- Common traps

**Cases:**
- Facts (2-3 sentences max)
- Holdings (one sentence)
- Why case exists (what rule it establishes)
- Exam trigger facts

**Policy:**
- Major tensions (efficiency vs. fairness)
- Competing positions
- Exam-ready paragraphs

**Hypos:**
- 5+ hypos per class
- Variations on fact patterns
- Multiple torts/defenses
- "Most likely Huang variation"

---

### What to Exclude

**From audio prep:**
- Verbatim rule statements
- Detailed case briefs
- Extensive footnotes
- Dense policy paragraphs

**From text prep:**
- Conversational filler
- Stories without doctrinal point
- Missing sources (flag explicitly: "Case not available")

---

## Case Brief Format (Standard)

*All case briefs in this course follow this format:*

```markdown
## Case Name, [Citation] ([Year])

### Rule of Law
[Concise statement of the legal rule]

### Facts
1. [Key fact 1]
2. [Key fact 2]
3. [Outcome]

### Issue
[Primary legal question]

### Holding & Reasoning
### ([Justice], J.)
[Yes/No]

1. [First point of reasoning]
2. [Second point]

### Disposition
[Affirmed/Reversed/remanded]
```

---

## Key Course Themes

### Issue-Spotting Strategy

**Systematic approach:**
1. **Identify all parties** (P, D, third parties)
2. **Scan for all torts** (intentional, negligence, strict)
3. **Check defenses** (justifications, privileges)
4. **Apply elements** to each tort
5. **Conclude** for each tort separately

**Common traps:**
- Missing non-obvious torts
- Forgetting defenses
- Incomplete element analysis
- Not addressing all parties

---

### Element Focus

**What matters:**
- Complete element lists
- How to prove each element
- What satisfies each element
- Fact patterns that trigger elements

**Exam technique:**
- State elements first
- Apply each element systematically
- Use "Here..." for facts
- Conclude explicitly
