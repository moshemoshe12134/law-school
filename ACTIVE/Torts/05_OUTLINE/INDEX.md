# Torts Outline Index

**Purpose:** Modular outline sections organized by topic.

---

## Outline Structure

This outline is organized into topical sections (10-20 pages each), not one giant 150-page document.

---

## Sections

### [Topic TBD - to be populated from syllabus]

**Location:** `05_OUTLINE/[topic_folder]/`

**Contents:**
- Black letter law (complete rule statements)
- Elements breakdown (numbered with definitions)
- Key cases (holdings in one sentence each)
- Professor signals (from class reviews)
- Hypos (practice problems)
- Policy (exam-ready paragraphs)

**Status:** ⏳ To be populated when syllabus arrives

## How This Works

**After each class:**
1. Review document identifies outline updates needed
2. Copy inserts into relevant section folders
3. Update this INDEX with what was added

**Before exam:**
- Each section is exam-ready (10-20 pages)
- All professor signals integrated
- All hypos tested
- Policy sections complete
