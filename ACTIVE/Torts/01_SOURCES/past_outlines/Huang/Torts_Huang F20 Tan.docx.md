# Nature of Tort Law

1.  Four features of U.S. tort law fundamental to operation

    a.  Jury trial

    b.  Liability insurance: covers damages for bodily injury or property damage

    c.  Contingent fee system -- Ps not required to pay in order to bring suit, attys picky about suits to bring

    d.  American rule for costs -- each party pays its own way

2.  [Tort law has grown without any central authority to make it responsive to a clear set of express principles or agreed-upon goals]{.underline}

## Aims of tort law

- **Corrective justice**

  - When one party wrongs another, correction of the wrong may help restore the moral balance between them

  - Envision the individual injurer who directly compensates individual victim with his own money

  - Less useful today with corporations

- **Civil recourse**

  - Tort law is way of providing victims with recourse for civil wrongs

    - Vindicates P's need for recognition

  - Recognition that you've been wronged in a manner that is proportional to the seriousness of the wrong

  - Less useful today with corporations

- **Deterrence**

  - Tort law can prevent future tortious actions

    - Optimal deterrence: deter excessively risky activity so that only those losses worth avoiding are avoided

      - Does not indicate which values should be taken into account in determining which losses are worth deterring

      - Pro: produces economic solution where just enough deterrence to prevent risks not worth taking

      - Con: only takes into consideration economic values and ignores other human values (pain and suffering)

    - Absolute deterrence: Based on gains to D. Take away all profits of bad activity so no incentive to engage. Mostly used for punitive damages

      - Some activities are so bad that we should shut it down

      - Juries think this way for punishment when negligence is egregious

  - Rights oriented scholars object to this view

- **Loss distribution**

  - Promote broad distribution of losses

    - D can shoulder cost with shareholders or pass to customers

      - Pro: having large number of people to bear cost is better than one person

      - Con: doesn't satisfy sense of moral blame, tort system is expensive mechanism for distributing losses

- **Compensation**

  - Promote compensation of those who suffered injury. Return P to original state

    - Pro: Make people feel more secure

    - Con: We need more than just an injury to hold D liable so we need more than just desire to compensate P for their injury

- **Redress of social grievances**

  - Some want the law to express concern and respect for suffering, or be available as a substitute for vengeance

  - Idea that, even apart from these other functions, the right to sue in tort promotes the redress of social grievances especially at large institutions

- **A mixed system?**

  - Tort law likely reflects a variety of principles, functions, goals based on the situation

# Elements of a Tort

1.  **BREACH OF DUTY** (failure to comply with the applicable standard of care)

    a.  Negligence: failure to take care that a reasonable person would under the circumstances.

        i.  Standard: BPL

            1.  Always consider if there were other alternatives available to tortfeasor.

        ii. Method: Always start with identifying the negligent action (this becomes you "burden" in BPL)

        iii. Question: Objective v. Subjective

             1.  Physical disability?

             2.  Children? Doing an adult activity?

             3.  Expertise?

             4.  Emergency Doctrine?

        iv. Question: Take more care or deter activity altogether?

        v.  Shortcuts:

            1.  Negligence per se (statutes) -- violation = liability, no safe harbor

            2.  Customs -- not dispositive 🡪 consider setting industry standards

            3.  Medical standards (mandatory, and create safe harbor if you meet)

        vi. Defense: Comparative Negligence or Contributory Negligence (Maryland)

            1.  Pure comparative (California) v. Modified comparative? (Wisconsin)

            2.  Assumption of Risk?

    b.  Affirmative Duties

        i.  Taking care during rescue

        ii. Duty to warn 🡪 if you cause the harm, you should at least warn

        iii. Failure to warn 🡪 adequate instructions or warnings

             1.  Must instruct and warn about possible consequences

             2.  Label clutter

        iv. Informed consent 🡪 medical standard

        v.  Special relationships 🡪 parents, or psychiatrists (duty to warn)

2.  **CAUSATION**

    a.  Factual Causation

        i.  But for causation

        ii. Multiple sufficient causes 🡪 non-tortious cause?

        iii. Multiple necessary causes

        iv. "Joint" tortfeasors (jointly -- all agree to do a tort -- conduct OR indivisible harm)

        v.  Proof problems

            1.  Preponderance of the evidence standard

            2.  Alternative liability (*Summers v. Tice*)

                a.  Shifts burden on the DF to prove themselves out of liability

            3.  Market share liability

        vi. Harm: lost chance (harm is redefined as lost chance of survival rather than death) -- gets around "but for" causation, but scope is limited.

        vii. Allocation of damages

             1.  Joint and several

             2.  Several

    b.  Legal Causation/Proximate Cause

        i.  Scope of the risk: harm within the risk

        ii. Pertinent Considerations

            1.  Type of Harm (usually breaks chain of causation)

            2.  Manner of Harm (usually does not break chain of causation)

            3.  Unforeseeable PL (Yes, see *[Plasgraf]{.underline}*)

            4.  Extent of Harm (No)

            5.  Intervening Cause (Maybe) -- see how big the cause is

                a.  E.g. you cause accident, then person goes to hospital where doctor operates and injury gets worse -- is the doc crazy or just plain old negligent?

        iii. Takeaways:

             1.  Make relevant arguments; these concepts are not set in stone.

             2.  Weird facts 🡺 Discuss proximate cause

3.  **STRICT LIABILITY** (abnormally dangerous, animals, trespass, conversion or nuisance**)**

    a.  Abnormally dangerous activity:

        i.  Foreseeability

        ii. Highly significant risk

        iii. Common usage to the area

    b.  Vicious animal 🡪 strict liability, non-vicious animal 🡪 no negligence?

    c.  Trespass to Land

        i.  Entry? Anything, includes intangibles (bacteria?).

        ii. Harm? Not necessary, presumption of invasion of feelings of ownership, but if no injury then just nominal damages

        iii. Intent 🡪 intended to enter land or be there (no intent 🡪 negligence)

        iv. Necessity exceptions 🡪 reasonableness test

    d.  Nuisance

        i.  Unreasonable and substantial interference with a person's use and enjoyment of their real property

        ii. Gravity of harm outweighs utility of conduct?

        iii. Coming to the nuisance?

        iv. Continued nuisance? Injunction v. damages?

    e.  Trespass (interference w/ possession of personal property)

        i.  Impaired use of chattel v. conversion:

            1.  Duration of interference

            2.  Type of possession

            3.  Profit/benefit to defendant

        ii. Damage/injury required to the chattel? Re-scope the 'personal property.'

4.  **DAMAGES/INJURY**

    a.  Legal remedies

        i.  Compensatory damages 🡪 includes pain and suffering for physical injury

        ii. Punitive damages (still ongoing)

        iii. Nominal damages

    b.  Equitable remedies

        i.  Permanent injunctions

        ii. TROs/preliminary injunctions

    c.  Statutory remedies

        i.  Full defenses to injury

            1.  "pure" economic harm

            2.  "pure" emotional harm

    d.  Class Actions -- FRCP Rule 23

        i.  Commonality and predominance for damages class?

        ii. Sub-classes and issue classes?

    e.  Multi-District Litigation

    f.  **Can we bargain or settle?**

5.  **POLICY CONSIDERATIONS**

    a.  Who decides?

        i.  Courts 🡪 judge v. jury

        ii. Legislatures 🡪 institutional competence

    b.  Rules v. Standards?

    c.  Moral Luck?

    d.  Aims of Tort Law

        i.  Social Welfare 🡪 safety for society, activity is necessary

        ii. Corrective Justice 🡪 restore moral balance

        iii. Civil Recourse 🡪 provide victims w/ recourse for wrongs and recognition Optimal Deterrence 🡪 achieves balance btwn activity and harm

        iv. Absolute Deterrence 🡪 stopping activity

        v.  Loss Distribution 🡪 spread the risk, who has insurance, who can distribute costs

        vi. Compensation 🡪 return the victim to their original state

    e.  Economic Theories

        i.  Cheapest Cost Avoider 1 (best knowledge)

        ii. Cheapest Cost Avoider 2 (best bargainer)

        iii. Coase Theory 🡪 Purpose of law? Contracting around the law?

**COASE THEORY -- FUNCTION OF LAW**

1.  [*Coase Theorem*:]{.underline} when there is no transactions costs, regardless of where liability is placed, the parties will bargain to get the cheapest, most optimal solution (school w/ giant fan and factory w/ scrubbers)

    a.  Questions the **purpose of the law?** Do we need law at all if society will achieve most cost efficient result?

2.  [Critiques and Limitations of Coase Theorem]{.underline}

    a.  Assumes there is no transaction costs 🡪 unrealistic and sometimes bargaining is impossible (e.g. too many parties, unknown parties)

        i.  Coase works when there is good bargaining ability:

            1.  Sophisticated parties who know how to negotiate

            2.  Parties have pre-existing relationship

            3.  Fewer parties

            4.  Harms are easily monetized

        ii. Role of Law: if TC costs are high, law is important.

    b.  Ignores distributional consequences: fairness, fault, etc.

        i.  Coase works when bargaining power is equal:

            1.  2 big businesses

        ii. Role of Law: Where we stick liability, that party must bribe or pay, so law attempts to place liability on CCA (either party that knows more, or best briber) 🡪 creates incentive for person stuck with liability to actually find the CCA.

# Negligence

- **Negligence is the failure to exercise reasonable care, or the care that would have been exercised by a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances.**

  - Also referred to as ordinary care, due care.

    - NOT average care. What the average person ought to do.

  - General standard: Asks for normative or evaluative judgment rather than pure fact

    - A general negligence standard can be applied when jury is familiar with situation at hand. If jurors not familiar, they rely on experts to educate the jury on situation to decide what due care would have been.

      - Jurors create rule for the particular case based on general RPS, then apply that to evaluate D's actions

      - Judge asks jury to decide what a reasonable person would do under the same/similar circumstances using objective standards. Don't look into the mind of the actor.

        - We judge what they did against objective standard of an imaginary reasonable person.

      - Before the trial, judge can interfere in case before it ever gets to a jury. Restatement language allows judges/attys tools to make arguments.

    - NOTHING in negligence law requires that like cases be decided like other like cases.

  - Not one single thing to meet. Conduct can be unreasonable for different reasons

    - Foolish, careless, selfish

## The Reasonable Person Standard

- **Restatement 3d definition of negligent:**

  - Requires exercise of reasonable care under all circumstances

  - Factors to consider are **foreseeable likelihood** that the person's conduct will result in harm, the **foreseeable severity** of any harm that may ensue, and the **burden of precautions** to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm.

- **RPS is aspirational -- imagines the ordinary RP we expect in the community and does not reflect the "average" person.**

  - Usually cannot take expert skill-level into account when deciding this.

- **Assumes perfect compliance, reasonable person is reasonably careful at all times.**

- [*Adams v. Bullock*]{.underline} (Court of Appeals of NY, 1919) Child burned from swinging long wire over edge of bridge and hitting trolley wires that ran below brings. Could not reach wires by just bending over bridge.

  - Cardozo: Only extraordinary situation would make wires dangerous

  - Reasonable care means that you are responsible for protecting against **foreseeable** accidents.

  - If there are reasonable precautions, take them. BUT some precautions are too expensive and not worth taking (i.e. burying the trolley wires underground).

### Contributory and Comparative negligence

- **Contributory negligence**: The failure of P to exercise reasonable care to protect himself or his property from the risk of harm or loss

  - D has burden to show that P breached a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect himself from harm, and this breach was both a cause in fact and a proximate cause of his harm.

  - [Core of defense is idea that it is unfair to impose liability on D when P has negligently contributed to own injury.]{.underline}

    - Critique: Opposite of this is also true -- unfair to completely relieve D of liability because P's negligence was also a cause of his injury.

    - Critique: Under this concept, D can anticipate being relieved of liability even if they were negligent, so it undermines deterrence.

    - Critique: May undermine corrective justice aim of tort law

  - In most states, contributory negligence is complete bar to recovery. Only way P can recover is if he is careful and D is not.

    - If courts realized this is harsh, so comparative negligence rose in popularity

- **Comparative negligence: Pure and Modified -- ALWAYS analyze how one model or another changes the outcome**

  - All but 4 states (AL, MD, NC, VA, DC) now use comparative negligence

  - **Pure**: P's negligence is never a complete bar to recovery as long as D was somewhat negligent.

    - Jury determines how much P was negligent and how much D was negligent, then jury takes total damages amount and decreases it by the % they have found P to have contributed to injury.

    - 13 states use this

  - **Modified**: if P is found to be more negligent than D, comparative negligence does not apply and P's contributory negligence is a complete bar to recovery

    - So if jury finds P was 51% responsible, P gets nothing.

    - When P is less than 51% responsible, P gets what he would have under pure form.

    - 33 states use this

    - Argument for: the other side was more negligent and therefore had more of a duty

  - **Arguments for comparative damages:**

    - Strikes a moral balance. Incentivizes P to be careful but still holds D accountable for their liability. Both are therefore careful and both pay some when not.

    - Serves deterrence, loss distribution, corrective justice

- [Core v. North Carolina Parks and Recreation]{.underline} (Court of Appeals of NC, 2018), P and friends at a Lake with pier that went 375 ft into middle of lake. No signs showing depth of water. Lake was dark and couldn't see bottom. P dove in headfirst and water ended up being 18 inches deep.

  - Arguments that P was contributorily negligent: P didn't know depth, should have checked before diving in headfirst, no one told him it was okay to dive.

  - Arguments that D was negligent: No signs with depth, no signs saying not to dive, no signs explaining why the water was dark, ladders and dock may have implied it was deep.

### Formula for Negligence: BPL

- The Hand Formula was developed to analyze what it means to be negligent. Affords a way of thinking about the circumstances under which a reasonable person would risk harm or would instead take steps to reduce the risk.

- [Unpacks the general notion of reasonable behavior into three categories:]{.underline}

  - **The foreseeable change in the probability of harm caused by an act of precaution or an omission of such act (P)**

  - **The magnitude of that harm if it occurs (L)**

  - **The value of the interest that must be foregone or sacrificed in order to reduce the risk of harm (B)**

- **Compare B vs. P x L**

  - **If B \> PL then no negligence**

  - **If B \< PL then negligence**

- **Foreseeability is important here.** We may require one to foresee the change in P and L to account for it in calculation.

- **Take the untaken precaution and weigh P and L against it. [How would it have changed?]{.underline}**

  - **Cardozo sees the untaken precaution in Carroll towing as having a bargee on board. This was super cheap, so B was very small.**

- This is a fact-intensive analysis, and the outcome may change depending on how one views the facts.

  - Think about: Does BPL work here, should we use it?

  - Justification: Conceptualizes fuzzy RPS, we do these calculations everyday (in perfect world, this just quantifies common sense), when an actual gamble is so trivial it is reasonable not to take a precaution, efficiency (better for society if we do not pay for precaution)

  - Critiques: Incommensurability of BPL, information costs and foreseeability, how does it work with age/capacity? Also people have moral issue with putting number/price on human pain and suffering

  - [Holding:]{.underline} Using BPL, the court found that Anna C was negligent

    - B \> P x L

    - **B: The cost of the bargee being on the boat**

    - P: The probability that the barge would sink without a bargee on board minus the probability that the barge would sink with a bargee on board

    - L: Whatever flour could have been saved if bargee had been on board

- In practice: factors listed in the restatement third of negligence. Majority of courts use the formula if the parties make their case in cost benefit terms, some ignore it, a few use it.

  - Isn't this just common sense? Basic intuition in judicial thinking about negligence even before Hand formulated it. Ex: Cardozo in Leo Adams case.

## Objective vs. subjective standard

- **Objective standard:** Reasonable care under the circumstances does not include the incapacities or limitations of the person whose behavior is under evaluation.

  - **It does not matter that D acted in good faith or did his best.**

  - Pro: Threat of liability under objective standard can be deterrent and is easier to measure than subjectivity.

### Children and the Infirm

- **Subjective standard -** Some situations in which some subjectivity is brought in to tailor to P:

  - **Children -- Adults are expected to take extra protective care around them**

    - Children under 4, 5, 6, 7, (depending on state) can't be negligent at all because they cannot be expected to exercise due care

      - Parents are not liable for torts of their children, though they may be liable for their own negligent supervision.

    - **EXCEPTION: When children are engaging in an adult activity, they are held to the adult standard of care**

      - Hard for adults to take extra care for self-protection when kid is doing adult activity (how can they know it's a kid?), we don't want kids doing these activities, there is not value in giving them subjectivity

        - No benefit to immunizing children against liability harm caused by adult activities because unless child is capable of complying with adult SOC, shouldn't be partaking in activity anyway

        - NOTE: It is arbitrary what is an adult activity. Can be skis, golf, etc.

    - Ex: NYC case where a 4.75 year-old runs down woman on the street. Law said she would have to be under 4 years old to not be negligent. Judge said she would be judged against the standard of a child with the same age and experience.

    - [Goss v. Allen]{.underline} (NJ Appellate Court, 1975), D was 17 and skiing and had never been skiing. He ran over P on his skis in the parking lot.

      - Court held that a 17 year-old engaging in an adult sport should be held to same standard of care as an adult in similar circumstances.

+-------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| - **Over 17 y/o**                               | > *RPS*                                                                 |
+=================================================+=========================================================================+
| - **Between 4,5,6,7 and 17**                    | > *Age capacity, experience, etc...Unless partaking in adult activity.* |
+-------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| - **Under 4,5,6,7 (depending on jurisdiction)** | > *No negligence*                                                       |
+-------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

- **Adult with physical incapacity**

  - Taken into account in judging reasonableness of behavior **if the person has a defect that is recognizable to everyone around** so that others can take reasonable precautions based on his/her defects

    - Idea is that physical defects are visible, measurable, certifiable

  - Jury may consider whether physical limitations should induce the person to take extra precautions or not engage in activity at all.

  - **Mental infirmities are not taken into account** because you can't know if it is constant and it's hard to recognize for those around them

### Rules or standards? 

- **Judge decides matters of law**

- **Jury decides matters of facts**

  - **Issues are submitted to jury if reasonable people would disagree on them**

  - **Issues are submitted to the court if reasonable people would not disagree on them**

  - Decision about whether a particular issues poses a question for a jury is made at trial through rulings and motions

  - Tendency over time for multiple rules of law over what is and is not negligent. Courts inclined to leave juries with even greater discretion as to what constitutes negligence and make fewer rulings as a matter of law on this. This is about rules versus standards

- **Rules**: Comparatively concrete and specific, comparatively self-applying norms

  - Facilitate predictability of the outcome and are therefore more likely to produce settlements. Make it easier to treat like cases alike

  - Made by judges. Do not go to jury if facts are known. Reasonable people would not disagree.

  - Pros: Uniform, specific, cheaper, avoids prejudice, promotes settlement

  - Cons: can be unfair, ignores circumstances, arbitrary, can be manipulated, maybe judges not competent to decide ordinary care

- **Standards**: more general norms that require comparatively more judgment and discretion for application. Permit greater flexibility, leave room for nuance distinctions and are more conducive to justice, all things considered. Better suited to change with the times.

  - For juries, involves discretion depending on circumstances.

  - Some give decisionmaker substantial guidance, others are more open ended

  - Pros: Flexible, nuanced, legitimacy in jury setting ordinary care, less harsh

  - Cons: Uncertain/unpredictable, more mistakes, similar cases not decided alike, more expensive.

  - **Ex. Of Standard Application:** ***Davies* as referenced in Core v. NC Parks case**

    - 14 year old dove into water to swim to friend from a floating deck. Water only 1 ft deep, P broke her neck. P was experienced swimmer

    - Held: P was contributorily negligent and failed to use ordinary care before diving before she didn't confirm water depth and she should have known it was dangerous to dive when depth unknown due to experience swimming/diving.

    - Contrast with Core: P in Davies swam to the dock several times, was told not to dive in unknown water depth at camp, mom told her not to dive off the dock at home. P in Core was first time visitor and made numerous observations before concluding water was deep enough.

    - Takeaway: **Some similar cases before will not automatically decide the current case before the court. A case-by-case approach required in torts cases to determine whether a particular P was negligent on a particular occasion.** Must analyze negligence ex ante. Just because there were alternatives to enter water doesn't mean P was negligent as a matter of law.

- **Judge or Jury: The Railroad Cases**

  - [Baltimore and Ohio R.R. v. Goodman]{.underline} (U.S., 1927), P was killed when truck he was driving was struck by D's RR train at a crossing. There was a home that obstructed the view of P. D argued P was contributorily negligent as a matter of law and therefore should not go to jury

    - [Holding:]{.underline} Holmes granted motion for declaratory judgment, P was liable for contributory negligence in failing to get out of his truck and look for train. It is clear that when a driver approaches RR tracks, there is a risk in coming into contact with a moving train, so P should have taken precaution to get out of car. When the required standard of care is clear, it may be articulated by court without submission to jury.

    - [Takeaway:]{.underline} Clear standard is set, this is a bright line rule.

  - [Pokora v. Wabash Ry.]{.underline} (U.S., 1934), P approached RR crossing and wanted to cross, there were multiple tracks. P's view was obstructed by box cars on the RR. Before he crossed the track, he stopped to listen and heard nothing. He crossed the track and was hit by train. P did not get out of car.

    - [Holding:]{.underline} Cardozo says that the case needs to go to a jury. People are making too much of the Goodman rule where they are applying it strictly as "Get out and look or you're responsible." Cardozo lists reasons why it would be stupid for P to exit car (could be more vulnerable to getting hit, by the time he gets back in car, train is now here). There is no rule of conduct for when you are driving over tracks, this is why we use RPS for the jury.

    - [Takeaway]{.underline}: Even in similar cases, judges should refrain from framing standards of conduct into rules. Should be sensitive to the particularities of the case.

## External sources? Custom, Malpractice, Statutes

- **Custom:** Evidence of non-compliance with custom may be used offensively to show negligence, and evidence of compliance with custom may be used defensively to show reasonable care. **It is only evidentiary = weak**

  - Even in the face of uncontradicted evidence of a party's compliance or noncompliance with custom, the jury may find that the party's action was or was not negligent. The weight that should be accorded to custom is up to jury.

  - Practice need not be universal to be a custom, but it must be more than just one of a number of different practices.

  - If the practice in question doesn't qualify as custom, then the party on whose behalf the evidence of compliance or noncompliance was admitted is entitled to an instruction expressly permitting the jury to consider the fact that there was a compliance or noncompliance issue with the standard. P is still entitled to point to an untaken precaution if she contends the reasonable person would take it.

  - **Compliance with custom is the "bare minimum."** It is useful sometimes and can only be used as evidence if it is deemed relevant.

  - **Pro**: Direct normative force, may show what constitutes reasonable care because what is generally done often tends to be what ought to be done. If actor compliant with custom, cautions jury against finding negligent because it implies entire industry is negligent. If noncompliant, maybe easier for jury to decide that they are negligent. Promotes reliable and accurate decisions. Can make potential victims aware of customary practices of potential injurers to make judgments about necessary levels of self-protective care.

  - [The T.J. Hooper**:**]{.underline} Two barges and their cargo were lost in transit during a storm and tugboat operator was sued. Tugboat operators failed to equip the tugboat with a working radio, which would have given them a weather forecast/storm warning for the day. 90% of tugboats had radios, however, most radios were personal equipment of the barge captain and not supplied by operator -- so not a general custom for operator.

    - [Held:]{.underline} Barge operator is liable for negligence. Judge Hand said to consider custom but it is not a complete shield

    - [Takeaway:]{.underline} **Custom is not conclusive but can be persuasive**. If a whole industry is behind, so the whole industry is negligent. **Some precautions are imperative that even their universal disregard will not excuse their omission.**

  - **Noncompliance vs. subcompliance:**

    - **Noncompliance:** You don't do what the custom is, but you do something else that satisfies the same objective as the custom. Different mode

    - **Subcompliance:** You didn't do what the custom is and you didn't do something else to satisfy the same objective. No mode.

- **Malpractice:** Special standards govern the conduct of professionals. Requires expert testimony and is more rule-like. **On/off switch between negligence and non-negligence.**

  - Jury cannot use common sense and must defer to expert testimony. But, Jury can choose which expert to believe.

  - **Exception:** Common knowledge -- The negligence can be assessed by a layperson (i.e. surgeon leaves a piece of equipment in body)

  - **Majority rule:** Compliance with custom is not negligent; failure to comply is malpractice.

  - **Two Schools of Thought/Respectable Minority Rule:** Noncompliance is not malpractice if D complied with a school of thought/practice followed by a respectable minority (this can be a complete defense)

    - We want to allow some room for industry to advance so we allow for jury to decide if the professionals' behavior may have been in this respectable minority.

  - Malpractice versus Custom: Should they be treated differently?

    - Professional work can be really technical, need institutional competence, malpractice moving towards national standard of more rule-like. Protects professionals (incentive for them to go into the job). BUT, the case about the tugboat could be just as technical and complex, whole industry can be negligent and the standard may not be keeping up.

- **Statutes:** Unexcused violation of a statute designed to promote safety is negligence *per se* (Negligence as a matter of law).

  - Statute can act as standard of tort law (borrow from statute)

  - Compliance with the standard does not mean you're not negligent. **It's just the bare minimum.**

  - **Exceptions:** Necessity, emergency (noncompliance is safer), capacity, limited statutory purpose (P must have been within class of persons or suffer the type of harm that the statute was designed to protect).

    - **Violating the statute only means that the amount of care you are taking is too low, and that doesn\'t matter if there is no duty. If there is no duty, there is no negligence**

    - **P must be in the class of persons and suffered type of harm intended to be protected by statute. Courts likely to read statute's protection broadly to include indirect injuries.**

  - [White v. Sabatino]{.underline} (USDC Hawaii), Drunk driving case that ended in death of P decedent. Other party who crashed into P's car was drinking on a snorkeling ship prior to driving. P claimed ship violated statute prohibiting all you can drink service when it did not properly control their customers' alcohol consumption (they served unlimited drinks for a fixed price over a fixed time).

    - **[Held:]{.underline}** D is liable. **Tort law can borrow a standard from statute even if the statute is not really about tort liability**. Court concludes that the alcohol ordinance is designed for the protection of the safety and welfare of the general public from potential harm, such as automobile accidents, that a patron of \"all you can drink\" may cause.

  - **Policy considerations:** Why not have statutes be safe harbors?

    - Case for: If statute replaces common law, then this makes sense. Could provide protection against tort law so actor can do something. Statutes can protect, so companies can do cost-benefit analysis that juries normally hate.

    - Case against: Torts needed to provide justice, compensation, deterrence, statutes may not serve these aims. How can we leave it to elected officials to determine all this at the time the statute is written?

# Strict Liability 

- Strict Liability is imposed in the absence of negligence by D only when a dangerous activity is abnormally so.

  - D could be actually very reasonably and still be held liable for harm that he caused.

  - We use this when taking more care has little effect because the activity is just inherently dangerous. Thus, SL is activity based and control the activity level.

  - **When an actor can change their level of care to mitigate risk, we use negligence. When an actor cannot manager care, then we use SL.**

- **In a strict liability case, once you have shown that the activity is subject to SL, you've now satisfied the "breach of duty" elements of torts because the act itself is a breach of duty.**

  - When you do HWR for SL, thinking about if the harm was within the universe of the risk that we assessed in saying whether the activity was SL (was it part of your calculus in the 6 factors?)

- **Duty of strict liability: You can engage in an abnormally dangerous activity, but actors must pay their own way. There is a duty to compensate those who are injured in the course of the activity.**

  - **Why have this at all? Why have negligence at all?**

    - Simple answer is negligence is just the dominant regime we've used and therefore we don't need SL so much but we use SL to fill the holes.

    - Or maybe this is just how torts are, maybe negligence serves the aims of tort law better, maybe negligence is better for the factfinder.

**Restatement second strict liability -- sets out a 6 factor balancing test to decide if the activity is abnormally dangerous**

- Existence of high degree of risk of some harm

- Likelihood that the harm that results from it will be great

- **Inability to eliminate the risk by exercise of reasonable care**

- **Extent to which the activity is not a matter of common sense/usage**

- Inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it happened

- *Extent to which its value to the community is outweighed by dangerous attributes*

<!-- -->

- Posner: SL should be imposed when activities involving a high degree of danger that cannot be feasibly prevented by the actor's being careful or potential victims' altering their behavior.

- **Scope: There is strict liability only for the kind of harm whose risk makes the activity abnormally dangerous for risks that are characteristic of the activity.**

  - **There is only strict liability if engaging in the relevant activity is not only the cause in fact, but also the proximate cause of the harm the plaintiff suffered**

  - **Defendant is not strictly liable if the harm in question results from an act of god, or the unforeseeable intervention of a third party, or from the plaintiff\'s knowing and unreasonable assumption of the risk of harm**

- **Vicious Propensity: One Bite Rule**

  - Applies to domesticated animals. When a SL test applies, can we also apply N? R2d vs. NY.

  - Wild animals: always SL

  - Domesticated: Typical is SL if known/should have known of propensity (one bite)

    - Some: Always SL (IL)

  - **R2d. allows for N too. NY does sometimes.**

**\**

### Strict Liability Illustrations

- [Doerr and Dobinski:]{.underline} (NY Court of Appeals, 2015), Doerr called a dog across a bike path in central park and a biker ran into the dog, Dobinski had 2 dogs and they ran out as 2 bikers went by and P fell off her bike as a result

  - NY common law doesn't allow negligence liability for injuries caused by animals. Only imposes SL on cases where injury results from a vicious animal and the owner is aware of the vicious character of the animal.

  - Court says no negligence in either case. Only SL. Hastings doesn't apply because no farm animals.

    - SL could have applied in Dobinski because the dogs had a propensity.

  - Other theories for why negligence may apply: D launched instrument of harm, want to encourage dog owners to be careful and there's a way to make the activity more careful.

  - Case for SL: even with precautions, can't really be 100% protected against animal harm so there's no incentive to be gained by negligence regime deterrence. Dog doesn't have to listen, dog has own brain.

- [Bard]{.underline}: Farm worker injured by farm owner's bull. Court holds no SL, because there was no known propensity. No negligence in animal cases where SL may apply (NY rule).

- [Hastings]{.underline} exception to NY rule: Narrow reading is negligence may apply when farm animals wander off property and cause injury because you didn't fence them in. It's not about vicious propensity, it's about your negligence. But this is only about farm animals. Broad reading: this isn't necessarily an exception from the rule, this case is more about the owner's negligence in letting the animal out than the will of the animal.

- Ways to distinguish [Hastings]{.underline} and [Doerr]{.underline}

  - Livestock vs. pets

  - Landowner and animal owner vs. just animal owner taking pet off property.

    - People expect dogs out of houses, not bulls off farms.

- [Indiana Harbor Belt RR v. American Cyanamid Co.]{.underline} (US Court of Appeals, 7^th^, 1990), A valve on the bottom of the train tanker was negligently closed, so it leaked a toxic chemical in a residential area of Chicago. The IL EPA fined P, which sued D to recover.

  - [Holding:]{.underline} Posner applies the R2d 6 factor test.

    - Negligence affects care level, SL affects activity level

    - In this case, increased care would have fixed the problem

    - Alternative routes are not available, and we don't want to stop this activity altogether. No way around the railroad system that goes through major metropolitan areas.

    - Negligence takes care of the problem, so no need to apply SL

  - Counter to Posner analysis: Alternative routes exist (flying), residents don't have choice (poor), spills are inherent danger of transporting dangerous chemicals, can use alternative chemicals.

  - Notes that N can make costs prohibitive, and avoiding SL can make people more careful

  - Focus on deterrence. Law and economics perspective -- is this the best approach? Other aims of tort law to emphasize?

- [Guille Ballooning Case:]{.underline} Classic modern SL case. D was ballooning and landed in a vegetable garden in NYC. Crowd tramples garden to "rescue" him, vegetable owner sues ballooner.

  - Posner uses [Guille]{.underline} to illustrate the 6 factors

    - Classic example where D was not negligent, and maybe was using utmost care in ballooning. His activity was not common or helpful to society and there was no way to prevent dangers by using more care. He was also ballooning in a bad area.

    - Looks not at harm that ensued, but the risk of the activity. Point is not that balloon didn't hurt anyone, it's that it could have hurt many people.

  - **The fact that balloonist didn't do anything wrong and is still liable creates a question for actors: is it worth it to do the activity at all? Posner says that there is an extra dimension of choice when it comes to SL.**

**\**

#### Strict Liability and Comparative negligence

- **Defenses: Contributory or comparative negligence is a defense to SL in some jurisdictions and not in others.** Availability of the defense may depend on the type of SL action at issue.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Liability for D*                                    *Effect on P*
  ---------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  **No liability**                                     Like SL (starting point of tort law, P eats cost)

  **Strict liability**                                 Like no liability (D eats costs no matter what)

  **Negligence**                                       Like SL unless D is negligent

  **Negligence + Contributory Negligence**             Like SL unless D is negligent and P is not negligent

  **Pure Comparative Negligence**                      Like SL + comparative negligence

  **Strict Liability + Pure Comparative Negligence**   Like pure comparative negligence (D eats it)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Strict Liability v. Negligence

- If you can take (more) care to eliminate the risk you are in the world of negligence.

- If you cannot eliminate the risk with care, then you are in the world of strict liability.

- **Strict liability can modulate both care and activity levels**

  - SL can obviously modulate activity level

  - Might be too expensive to continue activity

- But can also modulate care level

  - If it is worthwhile activity, an actor would choose to be more careful to avoid total harm that would cost them each time harm occurred.

  - Actors *internalization the risks* under SL to change care or activity levels.

    - You break you buy -- bull in the china shop

- **Negligence can modulate care and activity levels too (but less effective)**

  - If reasonable person standard of care is high, then P may lower activity level because P doesn't think they can perform the activity with enough care.

  - Court can technically declare an entire activity negligent, but this is rare

  - Negligence might also prevent deterrence b/c if you take enough care, you have a safe harbor from liability and so no incentive to regulate activity levels regardless of number of injuries or dangerousness of activities

  - Negligence also places costs on victims (SL for P)

- **Strict Liability places decisions of activity and care on individual (better at CCA)**

- **Negligence 🡪 court/jury determines if care level is sufficient (court decides CCA)**

  - Courts rely on customary evidence for N analysis, but custom may be wrong

- **If SL works so well, why do we need N? Is SL better for finding the cheapest cost avoider?**

  - Plaintiff's role? SL creates free harbor for victims so they don't need to take care

  - Fairness 🡪 better to leave accident on victim, unless actor is blameworthy?

  - Tradition 🡪 negligence is default, why change?

# Vicarious liability

- Holding an employer liable for employee's wrong (balance between making sure entity that can pay damages does so versus not holding employer liable for situations where employee was not working within scope of employment

- Employer whose employee commits a tort may be liable in his own right for negligence in hiring or supervising employee. This is just negligence.

- **Employers can also be liable when they are not negligent themselves if their employees commit torts within scope of employment**

  - Reasons for:

    - Employer probably better positioned to make the activity level and research decisions that affect accident levels

    - Can be difficult to prove the particular employee was negligent b/c identity is not clear even if we know whose employee he was

    - Reduces information and error costs

- This does not substitute an employer's liability for employee liability. Rather, employee continues to be liable, but this adds the employer as additional D.

  - Serves loss distribution functions

  - Helps because the employee may be indigent/judgment proof

- We don't use VL over party that contracts an agent, the key here is that the employer has to be in control over the agent

  - Bright line distinction between employee relationships and contracts. Contracts can't be VL.

- Tort has to be in scope of employment

  - At some point, employer's capacity to control employee conduct diminishes, and justification for SL does too

  - Employer liable for torts committed on "detour" but not on a "frolic"

- Punitives? Just compensatory?

  - Majority of states allow punitives for the conduct of any employee and the restatement imposes liability for managerial agents

  - Rest. 2d Torts § 909c - Recognizes corporate liability in punitive damages for reckless acts of managerial employees.

  - Court is divided equally on this issue

- Ex: Exxon v. Baker -- Exxon was held liable for negligence of the drunk captain, but captain still paid a little.

- Ex: Carroll Towing was vicariously liable for bargee's N

- Ex: BP was vicariously liable for the Houston Engineer's N

# Duty

- **Duty is an obligation to take some action or to refrain from taking some action.**

  - **Question of law, decided by courts**

  - **Negligence is a question of fact, left to jury**

  - Think about: when do judges use duty to take the case from the jury? Ex: Palsgraf.

- **There is no common law duty to be a good Samaritan**.

- There is a general duty to not negligently cause harm, a general duty to exercise reasonable care.

- No Duty: Exception to the rule that you have a duty not to negligently cause harm: even if you are negligent, if there is no duty, you are not liable.

- **Affirmative duty:** exception to the exception -- a positive duty where normally you would have no duty. P is at risk of suffering harm and D might eliminate or reduce this risk of harm to P.

- **Misfeasance v. Nonfeasance**

  - Misfeasance: one may be liable in tort for a failure to act if one previously created the risk

  - Nonfeasance: one is usually not liable in tort for failure to act if one is merely withholding a benefit.

- Factors judges consider in determining duty:

  - Foreseeability of harm

  - Closeness of connection between P's harm and D's conduct

  - Moral blame attached to D's conduct

  - Burden on D and the consequences for the community, if duty is imposed

  - Policy of preventing future harm

  - Availability and prevalence of insurance that would be available if duty is imposed.

- [Moch v. Rensselaer Water Co.]{.underline} (Court of Appeals of NY, 1927), D water company didn't supply enough water to put out the fire. P claims they notified D of the fire and D neglected to supply water to suppress the warehouse.

  - [Holding:]{.underline} Because D did not have an affirmative duty to provide the water, the water company is not liable.

  - [Takeaway:]{.underline} One who merely withholds a benefit usually does not have a duty. One who assumes an act, even if doing a favor, may thereby be subject to the duty of acting carefully. Therefore, if D did not create the fire, D didn't have duty to put it out.

- [Cuyler v. United States]{.underline} (7^th^. Cir. Ct., 2004), Higgs babysits and abuses Norman baby. While at the hospital, the nurse notices the Norman baby has been abused, but does not report it, despite a statutory requirement to do so. A short time after, Higgs babysits and abuses the Cuyler baby, who dies due to the abuse. Cuyler family sues the hospital.

  - [Holding:]{.underline} Even if one violates a statute that would typically lead to negligence per se, one can only be liable in tort **if one violates a duty**

  - [Takeaway:]{.underline} To find someone liable in tort, you always need a duty. It's misleading because you'd think they are negligent per se for violating a statute, all negligence per se says is that **when there is a duty**, a statute can act as the standard of care and a violation means one is negligent. But we must find a duty first. **In this case, the court found that the statute did not create a statutory duty so we must find a common law duty**. The court refuses to find such a duty because it is an issue of nonfeasance, and because there is no special relationship that entailed a common law duty. If hospital had relationship with babysitter, then MAYBE hospital responsible for third parties hurt by babysitter.

## Affirmative Duty: Rescue and Undertakings

- Affirmative Duty: D's conduct does not negligently create risk of physical harm to P, therefore D has not breached any duty in this respect. P is independently at risk of suffering physical harm and D might, through exercise of reasonable care, eliminate or reduce this risk of harm to P.

  - The question becomes: is D liable for nonfeasance / Does D have an affirmative duty to help P?

  - There is no formula for predicting when the courts think there is an affirmative duty or limits on the duty. Every jurisdiction chooses their own rules.

- No affirmative duty to rescue another person from danger, either by action or warning, UNLESS you created the harm yourself.

  - Misfeasance: Create risk (launching force of harm)

  - Nonfeasance: Not removing a risk created by someone/thing else (refusing to be an instrument of good)

- Even if the cost of rescuing is small or nonexistent, and the danger is great, no duty to rescue. Based on respect for individual liberty; people just need to mind their own business. Practically hard to develop rules for who is liable to rescue with many people around.

- **Rescue/Undertaking**: In the absence of special circumstances or special relationship, one person has no affirmative duty to rescue another person from a position of danger, either by action or by warning

  - Distinguish between D who negligently created the risk of harm (misfeasance) and D who did not remove a risk of harm created by something else

    - If I have done nothing to put someone in danger, I have no duty to rescue them.

    - If I negligently put someone in danger, I now have a duty to rescue them.

  - **If you decided to undertake a rescue, then you MUST conduct it non-negligently**. Policy reason: By attempting to rescue, others did not attempt to rescue that might have been more successful.

    - [EVEN IF you were the only one there, you still have duty to not negligently rescue]{.mark}

    - Ex: flower pot, Sabatino DD

  - If you non-negligently create a danger to another person, you may have a duty to warn the other person of that danger because you are not minding your own business and should be responsible for warning/rescue.

    - [→ Montgomery v. National Convoy and Trucking Company]{.underline}, D truck stalls on icy highway, not as a result of D's negligence. A hill then prevented P from seeing the stalled truck until it was too late. P collided with truck and D was liable for injury to P resulting from negligent failure to warn approaching drivers of danger created by stalled trucks.

  - [Undertaking: Previous action created reliance. Contrast this with Moch]{.mark}.

### Duty to Warn: Special relationships

- **There is an exception to the general rule that there is no affirmative duty to rescue to protect D from harm more generally when the P and D are in a special relationship. With a special relationship, there may be a duty to protect.**

- Parent, babysitter, common carriers, innkeepers, sometimes psychiatrists

- **When there is a dependence by P on D, the D has waived right to mind own business and has undertaken a duty to protect P.**

- Psychiatrists may have duty to warn third persons endangered by patients

  - [Tarasoff v. UC Regents]{.underline} (1976), Psychiatrist had patient, Poddar, who told him he wanted to kill Tarasoff. Psychiatrist warned police and they detained Poddar, but then released him and Poddar went and killed Tarasoff 2 months after appt.

    - [Held:]{.underline} Psychiatrist had duty to warn Tarasoff because of special relationship with Poddar. It extended to victim.

    - Duty is based on if "reasonable doctor" would know that their patient was dangerous.

  - Psychiatrist is the only one who knows their patients plans to harm third person, so they have duty. Note: We are weighing confidentiality against human life.

  - Policy Implications: deters future patients that are dangerous from getting help, hard to predict/false positives, patients will be committed too easily, incentive for doctor not to keep any records of patient sessions, cry wolf, administrative costs, what about police liability?

- Ex: [Cuyler,]{.underline} Court decided there was no special relationship between hospital and Cuyler such that hospital had a duty to warn Cuyler because hospital had no special relationship with Higgs or Cuyler.

### Duty to warn: Products Liability

- Warnings serve one of two functions

  - Provide instructions on how to use product safely

  - Give consumers information about the unavoidable risks posed by a product so that they can decide whether to take these risks. Put the purchaser in the position to decide if the risk is worth it.

- Warning law attempts to transfer risk-utility to the purchaser of a product so they can decide whether the risks are worth the utility of the product

  - Some products have unavoidable risk, tort law should not impose liability on the manufacturer if adequate warning of risks has been given. Purchaser bears risk of injury

  - Some risks are so obvious that no warning is required, and P bears risk then too

- **If a reasonable alternative design would eliminate the product defect, then warning of risks does not protect from liability**

- If no reasonable alternative but product is still dangerous even after warning:

  - Tension between allowing jury to find that some products are too dangerous to be on the market at all, even when risks are known and understood

  - Must balance between consumer sovereignty and protection/safety

- **Standard: Adequate warning of foreseeable risks**

  - Jurors decide adequacy

  - Complete information is not possible to give and is not truly "strict"

  - **Takes into account feasibility, costs of providing warning, kind of info purchasers want/need**

  - **The restatement does not impose liability for injuries that result after adequate warning of the risks of these injuries was given.**

- **P must prove causation:**

  - **Proving P may not have used product if adequate warning had been given**. This is hard to prove.

  - Some courts created what amounts to a presumption that the P would have heeded an adequate warning if it had been given and possibly declined to use the drug.

- **Label Clutter:** diminishing returns from providing additional information. More risk warning means less likely user is to actually read instructions.

- [Hood v. Ryobi:]{.underline} P had an electric saw that had a guard and label said one should never take off the guard when using it. P took the guard off to make a cut and the blade flew off, injuring him. P argues that he was not properly warned of what would happen if he took the guard off the blade

  - [Held:]{.underline} P cannot recover for injury. He was properly warned, and the manufacturer does not need to put encyclopedic warnings that list every possible outcome. Court doesn't want label clutter. *P injuries were result of alteration of the tool, manufacturer is not liable for intervening alternations of the product that was superseding cause of injury.*

  - [Takeaway:]{.underline} Sometimes a warning can be sufficient to fulfill one's duty. In order to determine whether a warning is a sufficient one, must balance specificity of the warning with making sure not to provide so much info that would discourage users from reading the warning at all.

  - [Think about:]{.underline} the type of harm you'd expect upon seeing a general "do not remove guard" warning \> Consciousness of the receiver and the expectations you want to build of how much warning is enough.

# Causation

- Tort law is not interested in negligence that does not result in harm. Negligence focuses on the causing of injury, NOT the creation of risk.

- **Restatement 3d. 26: Tortious Conduct -- Must be a factual cause of harm for liability to be imposed. Conduct is a factual cause of harm when the harm would not have occurred absent the conduct.**

  - Usually only requires preponderance of the evidence to prove \> more than 50% likely

  - **Causation-in-fact -- using but-for test --** catch all the fish!

  - **Proximate cause/Scope of liability - using foreseeability/harm within risk --** throw out the fish that don't matter!

- **Theories underlying causation requirement in torts:**

  - Justice between parties: if D did not cause P's loss then D hasn't wronged P. But this is more obvious than it seems because if a D risks harm to P, P will think their action is still wrong.

  - Practicality: we don't have a system where D pays for negligence even if no one is injured because the people whose harm is risked but aren't injured have no immediate need for money, and the people who were injured without a liable tortfeasor do. This is just an impossible system

  - Deterrence: deter unreasonable behavior and give potential injurers the incentive to compare the amount of liability that they anticipate they will incur from taking a particular risk with the cost of reducing that risk by taking safety precautions.

## Causation-in-fact

- P must prove that if not for the tortious conduct, P would not have been injured.

- Causation can have several elements: who/what caused the harm? Did negligence cause the harm? What part of the harm was caused by what or whom?

- **Always remember: Being a negligent cause-in-fact makes D eligible for liability, but the D is not liable unless his negligence was also a proximate cause/scope of liability!**

  - To be negligent cause in fact is necessary but not sufficient to be liable

- Prominent way of showing causation-in-fact is but-for test. Substantial factor test is other one used by some courts.

### The But-For Test

- Most widely accepted test -- **requires determination of whether, but for D's negligence, the P would have suffered injury or damage**

  - If yes -- cause in fact is proved

  - If no -- D is not liable

- There are many causes in fact for any event. Being a cause in fact is not the same as being the main cause.

  - The key is whether one of these causes in fact was negligent

- P uses but-for test to prove the counterfactual to the factfinder.

  - Jury decides and relies on real world experience to determine what WOULD have happened, not what did

  - In cause in fact disputes, a court must decide whether an inference about what would have happened in this situation if D had not been negligent is permissible because of what ordinarily happens in situations like this when D has not been negligent.

  - There is no rule about how much evidence P must produce before meeting burden of production

- **But-for test requires a finding that, more probably than not, D's negligence was a prerequisite to what happened to P**

- [Comcast v. NAOOM]{.underline} (U.S., 2020) \[not a torts case\], ESN was 100% Black owned media company and sued Comcast under antidiscrimination law when Comcast refused to carry its channel. "But for" the fact that P was Black would he have gotten the contract?

  - [Held:]{.underline} P has to prove -- what would have happened in P was white? P doesn't satisfy their burden of proving this (other factors like his channel didn't have content comcast wanted, etc.)

- [Bostock v. Clayton County]{.underline} (U.S., 2020) \[not a torts case\], three employees fired, contended it was because of their sexual orientation, which would violate Title 7. Prohibiting discrimination in employment on the basis of sex.

  - [Held:]{.underline} Sex is the "on/off" switch, where BUT FOR the P's known sex, they would not have been fired. **You don't need to prove that a cause if the ONLY cause, just that it is the one but-for you need.**

- [Cuyler Baby:]{.underline} "But for" hospitals failure to report babysitter, proper agency would have stopped babysitter from working and Cuyler wouldn't have hired her and baby would be alive

  - **Difficult to construct a but for cause for nonfeasance.**

  - This counterfactual is very speculative so this is a good reason to not find liability. These counterfactuals require another party's choice to be different -- agency would act properly, family wouldn't hire her.

### Complications to Causation-in-fact: **Mult. Necessary / Lost Chance Doctrine**

- **Multiple necessary causes:** **Both are needed to cause the injury, both satisfy but-for causation.**

- **Lost Chance Doctrine:** the concept, usually limited to medical malpractice cases, where P is compensated for "lost chance" of survival. But-for cause would not work because if doctor diagnosed properly, patient may have died anyway.

  - Loss of chance redefines harm from death to "loss of survival rate"

- Anomaly: If you don't die, you still suffered the injury of loss of chance, but no recovery because no "harm" occurred. This is inconsistent and leads to not enough deterrence against doctors. We don't want to impose liability for risk creation.

  - Start with: Percent P would live if D had properly diagnosed P

  - Subtract: Percent chance P will live after negligent D finally diagnoses P (or if P dies and was never diagnosed)

  - Why confine lost chance to medmal?

    - Maybe professional responsibility? Legal incentives to rescue lives? More scientific data on survival rates with actuarial math?

  - [Matsuyama v. Birnbaum]{.underline} (Mass. 2008), P patient experiencing gastric issues, but at least 5 times the D doctor misdiagnosed him. P was finally diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. If D had properly diagnosed at Stage 2: 37.5% survival rate, at stage 4: 0% survival rate. P was deprived of 37.5% chance to live.

    - [Held:]{.underline} P can recover damages against D if P can prove that he would have had a better chance at surviving but for doctor's negligence. Medical science has developed credible methods to quantify the damage of malpractice on prospects for survival. There is strong public policy incentive to favor compensating victims of medmal. Important also to deter deviations from appropriate standards of care. Holding is limited to medmal.

### Complications to Causation-in-fact: **Multiple sufficient causes**

- **Both forces cause the harm and both alone would be sufficient to cause the whole harm. Courts consider both parties as causing the harm. Courts want to assign liability so P gets made whole.**

  - But-for test is under-inclusive and doesn't work!

- ***Restatement 3d. Torts § 27: "If multiple acts occur, each of which under § 26 alone would have been a factual cause of the physical harm at the same time in the absence of the other act(s), each act is regarded as the factual cause of the harm.***

- **Two simultaneous Causes (Both Negligent)**

  - Two fires come to burn a house, both are started from negligence.

  - But for test fails because the house would still have been destroyed, but courts have held that neither D can escape liability, **so both are held to have caused P's injury**

- **Two simultaneous Causes (One negligent, one not negligent)**

  - Some courts hold the negligent party liable, but you can argue either way

  <!-- -->

  - Should the one negligent party be held liable for the entire amount, even if damages would have occurred without their negligence?

  - **R3T 27 Comment d.** One cause tortious, the other innocent. [This Section applies in a case of MSC, regardless of whether the competing cause involves tortious conduct or consists only of innocent conduct]{.underline}. Conduct is a factual cause of harm regardless of any other cause with which it concurs to produce overdetermined harm. Question of [damages is different matter.]{.underline}

  - Imposing this type of liability is problematic because it will give such parties incentive to take precautions against harms that will occasionally occur anyway because of a simultaneous non-negligent cause, but imposing it could also still prevent negligent conduct.

  - Ex: Two fires, one negligent and one natural. Only natural could destroy the entire house but the negligent fire could destroy part. Both fires contribute to destroying the entire house

    - Negligent fire probably not liable, nature alone would have destroyed the house anyways. But can argue.

    - Cant hold negligent party liable for the whole house.

  - Ex: Two fires, one negligent and other natural, both independent sufficient causes in burning down the house.

    - Negligent fire most likely not liable as nature alone would have destroyed the house. But can argue.

    - Most courts hold negligent party liable in this situation.

  - Ex: Three fires, two negligent and one natural. All three independent sufficient causes to burn down house. Are the two negligent parties liable?

    - No "right" answer. Think of ways you can argue for or against liability using but for cause, multiple sufficient cause, and aims of tort law.

  - Ex: One negligent fire and God strikes house with lightening

    - No liability for fire starter.

- **Two sequential causes (both sufficient to cause harm)**

  - **Courts hold the first-in-time cause liable, but not the second-in-time**

  - Ex: One fire burns down the house, then another fire comes after. First fire is "pre-emptive" cause.

  - If the harm occurs sequentially, then neither fire can be said to be a but for cause of the harm b/c house would still burn down

    - First fire is not a but for cause but caused the damage. **D is liable, if negligent.**

### Complications to causation-in-fact: **Alternative Liability**

- Indeterminate causes are a problem because P is clearly injured by tortious conduct but cannot prove which of several possible Ds was more probably than not the actual cause of the injury.

  - When there are 2 possible Ds, courts might impose alternative liability. Each negligent D has liability and each is equally likely to have harmed P.

    - This is rare and more likely to be imposed on 2 Ds, not more. The more the D group gets, the more hesitant court becomes

    - Another factor in using alternative liability is the connection between or among Ds.

      - Pure strangers are less likely to be subject to alternative liability than Ds who are acting in "same arena"

      - Third restatement of torts states that the existence of a close connection between the Ds and the P characterizes many alternative liability cases

      - The more remote the connection, the less likely liability is to be imposed

      - In [Summers]{.underline}, Ds that were acting separately would have been less likely to be subject to alternative liability

- Alternative liability shifts the burden of proof for causation to Ds when it is clear that one of a group (but not the whole group) of Ds caused harm to P. Ds are independent tortfeasors held jointly liable.

  - Information forcing

  - Ds either have to prove it wasn't them that caused P's injuries, or apportion the damages amongst themselves.

- **Term to note - In concert:** Ds working together as a group contributing to the same act/activity (e.g. drag racing) and are all held liable together.

- **Term to note - Joint tortfeasors:** anytime multiple Ds held liable for same injury

- **Term to note - Joint and Several Liability:** When two or more defendants are liable to plaintiff for the **same** harm, damages are apportioned using \"joint and several liability\"

  - Plaintiff can sue any of the defendants can recover 100% of damages from any D that has liability, but P can **never** recover more than 100% of the amount of damages

  - Imposing joint and several liability places the risk that any defendant\'s insolvency on the other D(s), instead of the P - this is more fair then forcing P to bear the cost, if one of the Ds is unable to pay for some reason

  - "Several" liability 🡪 P must sue each D separately to get full amount of damages, can be based on comparative negligence percentages

    - D only responsible for own share of fault

    - Several liability imposes risk on P

  - Joint and Several liability is imposed in 3 main situations:

    - Defendants are **joint tortfeasors** - both defendants are involved in the same joint enterprise

    - Independent tortfeasors of a single **indivisible harm** - defendants are both necessary (but-for) causes for plaintiff\'s harm, but no way to pinpoint defendant\'s causal responsibility

    - Independent tortfeasors for a single, theoretically divisible, but **practically indivisible harm** -- BOP is on defendants to show how much damage they each caused, otherwise J&S

- **Policy reasons for alternative liability:**

  - Ds are more likely to be able to figure out who did what. So impose liability and let them bring proof and sort damages out.

  - Ps should not bear costs of uncertainty -- more fair and better deterrence to put costs on D.

- [Summers v. Tice]{.underline} (Supreme Court of CA, 1948), P and 2 Ds went hunting, both Ds negligently shoot towards same bird, P was shot in eye by one of the Ds, but it is unclear which D shot P

  - [Holding:]{.underline} Court applies alternative liability to shift burden of proof for causation to D

  - [Note:]{.underline} This is not an in concert case, Ds aren't shooting "in concert"

    - This is also not a MSC case because only ONE cause exists, we just don't know which

    - Limited group is important here. **If there are more Ds, less likely to impose liability even if it means P cannot recover.**

    - "When two or more persons are the sole cause of a harm, and P has introduced evidence that the one of the two is culpable, then D has the burden of proving that the other person was the sole cause of the harm because otherwise it would be unfair to deny the P redress simply because he cannot prove how much damage each did, when it is certain that between them they did all. If neither D can absolve himself, they must work out the damages amongst themselves."

    - What if there was 6 hunters and not 2?

      - They are all still negligent, and we know that one of them did it. Still not fair for P to not pay for the injuries

      - BUT we also can\'t be sure/hold everyone liable for the mistake of one person

    - The applicability of having everyone prove their way out with alternative liability can really vary with the circumstances

      - The more possible liable parties, the less each actor knows if it was them or not and can prove it wasn\'t them. But we still want plaintiff to have recovery

### Complications to Causation-in-Fact: **Market Share Liability**

- When a group is responsible for signature injuries (ex: signature disease) and it is unclear which member of the group injured a specific P, the court may impose market share liability, holding each responsible for their share of the risk on the market.

  - Requires 2 things: signature disease, identical product

- **Idea is that once it is clear that D's product injured some Ps, they shouldn't escape liability just because Ps can't show which Ds harmed which Ps.**

  - Achieves optimal deterrence b/c D must pay for the exact amount of harm caused based on market share

- **Absolute v. Relative:**

  - Absolute: Holds D liable only for their actual market share

    - Critique: P not always made whole

  - Relative: Require that a substantial share of the market be joined as Ds in the suit, and hold those Ds liable to 100% of P's damages.

    - Critique: overimposes of liability -- problem

- **National market share v. Regional/Local market share**

  - National is more available data, more accuracy in numbers

  - Regional/local is more fair potentially to Ds, some Ds maybe not so active in some remote regions.

- **Problems/Limitations**

  - Note used often b/c few signature disease

  - Limitations of market share information -- hard to determine proper share at time of time

    - Some manufacturers may have left the market

  - Same product by manufacturers might not be 100% identical or fungible

    - [Skipworth v. Lead Industries]{.underline}: Court refused to apply MSL to makers of lead paint because different pigments had different chemical formulations and resulted in different levels of bioavailability.

  - Over-imposition of liability -- some manufacturers are out of business, so others must overcompensate if using relative market share or there is under-compensation for P if imposing absolute market share

  - Does not serve corrective justice.

    - The wrong done to each P is corrected, but it is not necessarily corrected by the party who wronged that P

- **Thus, market share liability has been overwhelmingly rejected in cases involving other substances like asbestos, lead, or other drugs**

- [Hymowitz v. Lilly:]{.underline} (NY Court of Appeals, 1989), DES drug cancer side effect, where many manufacturers sold the exact same pill, but Ps do not know from which manufacturer they bought the pills.

  - [Held:]{.underline} Court imposes absolute national market share liability. Narrower markets may be good but national data is better. If a particular P can prove a particular D caused her harm, then court allows her to use normal product liability to sue. But this is contradictory b/c D cannot prove their way out by showing that their product was distinguishable from others.

  - **Takeaway:** We use the market share to proxy the amount of harm that the companies caused someone else. Measured by the risk that they added into the market. More pills means more risk added. Once you're in the market, you're in the market -- we are now looking at all moms that took the drug in the time frame.

  - We can't use alternative liability because there's too many makers of the drug and we know some are more liable than others so it's not fair to hold all equally liable.

  - **Possible defense:** manufacturer didn't target pregnant women.

### Consider: Comparative negligence or Comparative causation?

- Using comparativeness to divvy up liability

- Comparative negligence is not comparative causation

  - In comparing negligence, there's an automatic aspect of comparison of an aspect of causation, because the foreseeable probability of causing harm is a component of what it means to be negligent.

  - Jury's decision of degree of negligence attributable to P or D should therefore take into account the possibility that the conduct in question will cause harm, even though the amount of causal contribution in any one case is not relevant

  - **The law of comparative negligence has nothing much to say about the problems in making such comparisons, but these are simply issues for a jury to compare**

- **Multiple necessary causes:** maybe party that caused more damage should pay more?

- **Multiple sufficient causes:** maybe it makes more sense to look at negligent comparison? Harder to conceptualize and quantify comparative causation than it is comparative negligence.

## Proximate Cause/Scope of Liability

### Purpose

- **D is not necessarily liable for all harm that their breach of the applicable standard of care has caused.**

  - **Even after it is determined that D is under a duty to exercise reasonable care and elements of breach/cause in fact are established, liability is not imposed unless D's actions were also a proximate cause of P's injury**

  - There can be multiple PC

- Where in the long chain of but-for causes do we cut off liability? Think aims of tort law.

- **PC is totally made up by the factfinder.** Whatever arguments you want to make towards PC -- the act itself MUST be negligent. You are not liable just because you are a but-for cause.

  - **Can make arguments about whether foreseeability should factor into a duty (judge) or proximate cause (jury).**

- After the other pre-reqs to liability are satisfied, **PC operates as a limitation to D's liability**

  - As this connects to negligence suits, we still assume the existence of a duty to exercise reasonable care

  - No single formulation of rules governing D's liability or PC, sometimes used as a "fudge factor" that allows judges and juries to decide whether liability should be imposed even after other prereqs are satisfied

- **Policy arguments for/against PC:**

  - Pros: Normatively don't want negligent persons to have to pay for distant harms, deterrence is not served b/c unforeseen harms can't be deterred, impossible to administer a system where any cause is allowed to become a source of liability (we must break the chain at some point)

  - Cons: Important aim of tort law is compensations (negligent + injury should lead to compensation), moral luck -- there is no difference between tortfeasors who do same thing but only one results in harm. Is it just the same as negligence?

- **Consider: Cheapest cost avoider**

  - But-for: we want to make sure precautions would make a difference in avoiding the injury -- if the precaution doesn't actually prevent injury, no need to incentivize it

  - Proximate Cause: party that foresees harm should be liable but even if not foreseeable, there are some cases where liability will incentivize better future choices.

### The foreseeability test

- **D's negligence is a proximate cause of P's harm if causing that harm was a foreseeable result of acting as D did.**

  - In most ordinary cases, no questions at all regarding this.

- **Words to use in analysis: causal chain, intervening, superseding, direct**

  - Foreseeability can show up in all different places -- it is our job to make arguments

- Bert's note: This is misleading because foreseeability has very little to do with causation. More to do with negligence than causation.

- **Think of this in 2 phases:**

  - **First,** asking **whether D was negligent at all**, unreasonably risked harming someone/thing, to be decided under rubric of negligence. (General risk creation)

  - **Second**, whether the harm to the *particular* P or class was a foreseeable result of the D's negligence - under rubric of PC. (Actual injury materialized and that specific harm was foreseeable in the course of the D\'s risk taking)

- **Advanced issues -- Proximate cause**

  - Most issues that are not direct resolved with foreseeability test fall within 3 categories:

    - Harm that P suffers is **remote in time or space** from negligence of D

      - Directness test: D's negligence constitutes a PC if it caused harm to P directly. Only used in minority of courts now

      - The closer D's negligence is in time and space to P's harm, and the more direct the connection, the more foreseeable harm was to D.

      - **Remoteness in time does not preclude liability**

    - **Intervening/Superseding causes:**

      - Intervening cause: The act of an independent agent that destroys the causal connection between D's negligence and P's injury

        - Subsequent acts of third parties or forces are the immediate cause of harm, but the original negligence of the D is also a cause in fact of that harm

      - **But D does not get relieved of liability IF the intervention of third persons was reasonably foreseeable. So if the intervening cause, in the ordinary and natural course of things, could have been anticipated, D's negligence can be a PC.**

      - When the degree of foreseeability or the risk of injury to one in P's position is debatable, question of PC goes to jury

    - Cases where **some liability may be imposed even when some aspect of what occurred was foreseeable**

      - Four categories of cases in which something unforeseeable has occurred and question is whether there is liability despite this unforeseeability

      - **Note: what is "type" and "manner" is up to me to decide when arguing.**

### Harm within the risk test

- The harm within the risk test corresponds to the Scope of Liability, which is the **modern view for causation**

  - If HwR then within SOL

  - If not HwR then not within SOL

- Once damages, breach of duty, and cause in fact are established, liability is not imposed unless the harm that P suffered was one of the risks that made D's conduct tortious.

- **Restatement 3T 29: Liability is limited to harms that result from the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious.**

  - Jury must go back to reasons they decided that an action was negligent -- does the risk that occurred fall into the realm of risks they used to determine if the action was negligent?

  - Asks juries to consider reasons for creating a tort liability in the first place. Look at the competing aims of tort law.

  - Permissive standard -- even if harm is not principle risk of statute, you can still be HwR if it was a foreseeable, secondary and relevant risk.

- **Restatement 3T 36: Trivial contributions to multiple sufficient causes**

  - When an actor's negligent conduct constitutes only a trivial contribution to a casual set that is a factual cause of harm, the harm is not within the scope of the actor's liability.

- How to argue: Can make the harm within the risk really general or really specific depending on needs and case.

  - Can use thin skull rule

### Proximate Cause / Scope of Liability Illustrations

- [Berry v. Sugar Notch]{.underline} (Supreme Court of PA, 1899), Trolley speeding and a tree gets blown over by wind, falls on his car, injuring him. The tree fell right as the trolley passed beneath. Thus, P's speed brought him to the place of the accident at the moment it happened by.

  - [Held:]{.underline} Speeding is a but for cause, but not a proximate cause because it was not foreseeable that P's speeding would cause him to pass under the tree at the moment the free fell, and getting hit by a tree was not a harm within the risk of P's tortious conduct.

  - Hypo: Car speeding and spins out of control, crashing into a tree

    - Speeding is but for cause and also proximate cause because it was foreseeable that speeding would cause P to lose control of his car. Losing control of your car is a harm within the risk of speeding.

  - Hypo: Car 2 speeding even faster, tailgating. Passes Car 1, spins out of control, crashes into a tree.

    - Probably no PC or SOL here because P's speeding didn't cause car 2 to act tortiously, and car 2 is an intervening cause. It wasn't foreseeable that P's speeding would cause car 2 to spin out.

- [Jones v. Roth]{.underline} (Appellate Court of IL, 2019), P and D were in a car accident and P was injured. She saw a doctor for her pain and went to a PT. Months later, P was still not fully recovered and got on a bus and the bus driver negligently harnessed her scooter and she fell over and got hurt again.

  - [Held:]{.underline} Any negligence by D could not be deemed to have proximately caused the injuries P suffered in the bus accident because the bus driver was an intervening cause that was not a foreseeable risk created by D's initial negligence in the car accident. P falling out of a scooter because a bus driver negligently harnessed her was not a harm within the risk of D's tortious driving.

  - Hypo: After accident with D, P's surgeon makes a mistake

    - Argument for PC of D: It was foreseeable that P would get treated for the injuries caused by D's negligence, this was simply an unforeseeable manner of harm but a foreseeable P. Most courts say this.

    - Argument against PC of D: Doctor negligence was an intervening cause that was not a foreseeable outcome of D's negligent driving. Unforeseeable type of harm.

  - Hypo: Before accident with D, P's surgeon made a mistake and leg is particularly fragile

    - D's driving is a PC, this is just an unforeseeable extent of harm but the thin skull rule says D is still liable.

- [Sabatino DD]{.underline}

  - Hypo: D offered to DD but didn't. Sabatino crashes into a tree

    - Argument for PC of D: Sabatino crashing was a foreseeable risk and part of the harm within the risk that made the breach of the affirmative duty to DD tortious.

    - Argument against PC of D: Sabatino's drunkenness was an intervening cause? Shaky.

  - Hypo: D offered to DD but didn't. Sabatino is passed by aggressive driver, loses control, crashes into tree.

    - Argument for PC of D: Sabatino crashing was a foreseeable risk for D's failure to be DD. If Sabatino was not drunk, she would not have lost control maybe so

    - Argument against PC of D: Aggressive driver was an intervening cause that D could not have foreseen.

- [Palsgraf. Long Island RR,]{.underline} Railroad employees help passenger onto train, dislodge package of fireworks passenger was carrying. Package falls on tracks and explodes, causes scale to tip over and injury P

  - [Holding:]{.underline} Cardozo -- No liability, shouldn't go to jury because there was no duty owed from RR to P, therefore no negligence. Cardozo uses duty to take the case from the jury. He says P is an unforeseeable P, so no duty. Outside the orbit of danger, there is no duty.

  - [Andrews Dissent:]{.underline} Negligence behavior exists in the air, even if you hurt no one, foreseeability is part of the PC analysis, not duty. This should go to jury. When an act is negligent, D should be liable for damage that results to the world. Only cut off liability through PC by jury determination based on time and space, steam, directness, continuous sequence, intervening/superseding, and common sense/foreseeability

  - [Judge v. jury:]{.underline} Think about why Cardozo took it from the jury. Should he have?

  - **Neither opinion here is the law!**

- [Quisenberry v. Huntington Ingalls]{.underline} (USDC EDVA, 2018), P lived with father who was routinely exposed to asbestos from work. Developed mesothelioma and died. Does employer owe a duty of care to employee's family member when there's no relationship? (note: normally, special relationship between employer and employee would create duty, but that wouldn't extend to a non-employee family member).

  - [Holding:]{.underline} Rephrase the question using foreseeability: does the employer owe a duty of care to an employee's family member when it was foreseeable that the asbestos would end up there? Tort law does not require a special relationship to constitute negligence, the relationship exists when you spin off the risk into the world.

    - Creating a duty to a foreseeable plaintiff

  - Dissent: Thinks this conflates duty and PC, opens liability up to limitless plaintiffs. Implies that you can't sue someone unless there is a contractual relationship b/t tortfeasor and victim

# Towards Intentional Torts: Gross Negligence and Recklessness

- **[Gross negligence]{.underline}**: While ordinary negligence is failure to exercise degree of care that reasonable person would have, **gross negligence is an extreme departure from the care required under the circumstances or failure to exercise even slight care.**

  - **Based only on OBJECTIVE proof -- we don't look for malice, knowledge of negligent activity, etc.**

  - **Differs from negligence in degree, not kind.**

- When to use gross negligence:

  - There are not many consequences for calling something grossly negligent.

  - Some statutes mention specific measures for if someone is grossly negligent versus negligent

  - Sometimes gross negligence is the barrier to entry

    - Ex: Bloomberg article about whether government should set gross negligence as the standard under which Ps must sue for regarding coronavirus torts (negligence would be too easy/messy/too many lawsuits)

  - Compare the risk of the injury and the level of care. If it is so disproportionate and divergent, then can examine gross negligence

    - Consider what would be negligent and compare to what you think may be gross negligence

- **[Recklessness:]{.underline}** R2T Definition -- Conduct is in reckless disregard for the safety of another **if he does an act or intentionally fails to do an act which it is his duty to the other to do, knowing or having reason to know of facts which would lead a reasonable man to realize**, not only that his conduct creates an unreasonable risk of physical harm to another, but also that **such risk is substantially greater than that which is necessary to make his conduct negligent.**

  - Recklessness differs from gross negligence because it is subjective. We look at the mind and context of the actor and determine whether they knew or should have known that their conduct was an extreme failure to adhere to the duty of care required of them.

  - Indifference to risk, easily perceptible danger of death or substantial physical harm

<!-- -->

- **Recklessness needs some proof that suggests there is culpable mental state, such as:**

  - Inherently dangerous activity -- foreseeable that risks were high, so knew of the dangers

  - Proof of awareness that something is wrong and ignore advice and proceed anyways

  - Poor, bull-shit excuses that no one would believe

  - Other facts that indicate the activity is very dangerous and great injury is highly likely

  - Untaken precautions -- burden is very low for untaken precautions

  - Possible monetary motives

<!-- -->

- [Deepwater Horizon BP Case:]{.underline} There were two methods to check pressure for the drill line. After using the first test, they should have known something was wrong, but ignored the results after seeing the "kill line" pressure was okay. Judge holds that BP was guilty of gross negligence and recklessness.

  - Illustrates the effect of different standards of care, different definitions thereof, subjective/objective elements (compare the government to BP's def)

  - Reasoning in the alternative (judge examines both GN and R)

  - How aims of tort law/instincts about blameworthiness can put a thumb on the scale for/against finding liability

    - Factors court may consider in allocating blameworthiness: who is in charge, who set the chain of events?

      - Recall how judge differentiates between BP's gross negligence, Transocean's negligence, and Halliburton's negligence

        - BP was the final callmaker, they set the events in motion. Judge really pissed at them because they are fudging their story and records.

        - Transocean could have been better but spent a lot of time trying to fix the issues created by BP and may not have been fully aware of situation

        - Halliburton made bad cement but that wasn't even the actual cause of the issue. Judge holds them liable for a tiny piece because he's mad that they tampered with evidence.

    - Recall how the judge used the different untaken precautions to illustrate what was negligent and then what was grossly negligent as a way to justify the holding that BP was reckless.

      - Judge ends up saying that they proved BP was reckless which also covers GN.

  - Judge establishes BP's culpable mental state to prove recklessness through noting:

    - BP knows it was dangerous activity, and area drilling was difficult and hellish

    - Guy in Houston told rig that something was wrong w/ pressure test.

    - Bladder effect excuse: (1) could go to mental state because it's a BS excuse (2) could be objective b/c no one would've misread test results due to this.

    - Untaken precautions/BPL analysis: Burden was so low for untaken precautions

    - Motivated by money!

- Room to consider reasonableness when assessing N/GN/R and subjective/objective elements

  - Which facts would have alerted a reasonable person? (ex: one bad pressure reading? Two?)

  - Reasonable...who? Average juror? Industry worker? Industry worker with experience in negative pressure tests?

  - Reasonable under the circumstances: how does framing the circumstances different make conduct seem more/less blameworthy?

# Intentional Torts: Trespass and Private Nuisance

- There are four property torts, but we are focused on trespass and private nuisance.

  - These are harms that have lasting harm

- Property torts are not just concerned with money damages from damage to property, but also with personal rights to property ownership

- Trespass: Invasion of a property interest

  - D need not occupy to have intended trespass, but only to have intended to be present on or interfere with the possession of property that turns out to be owned by P

  - Trespass is actionable without proof of actual damage, although modern times it would be unusual to bring a trespass action only as a matter of principle

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Trespass**            **Ancient**             **Modern**
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------------------------
  *Invasion of...?*       Tangible/visible        Nontangible -- can be energy, invisible

  *Harm shown...?*        No need                 Feelings of space/interest invaded

  *What intent...?*       To act                  To act
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [Martin v. Reynolds]{.underline}, 1960, D owned an aluminum reduction plant that was emitting invisible particles that settled in P's land and ruined their grazing abilities, growth of plants, and hurt their cows. P sued for the 5 years of damage

  - [Held:]{.underline} Intrusion of unseen fluoride particles constitutes trespass when it interferes with the possessor's exclusive right to the land. We know that P's land was harmed because his animals were dying. Trespass is grounded on idea that landowner has his property and should not be interfered with. He is entitled to protection by law.

  - Prior to this, trespass dealt with only tangible invasion. Now, we care about whether P felt invaded.

  - Court uses the element of "intent" to just mean that D intended to act.

  - Court weighed between private nuisance and trespass -- the statute of limitations was shorter for private nuisance so P wouldn't have been able to recover all years unless trespass.

    - Case seems like a nuisance case but court pushed to trespass to help P

  - This is an "extreme modern view" -- not all courts are okay with this.

- [Amphitheater v. Portland Meadows]{.underline}: P claimed that a ray of light interfered with their screen but couldn't show actual damage or harm, so couldn't recover. [Martin]{.underline} court uses this as a way to establish the need to show harm, and by harm, he says it's P's feelings of invasion.

- **Defenses to trespass:**

  - **Private necessity: There is a risk to one party or his property only, and this party can reduce or eliminate that risk by damaging or destroying someone else's property**

    - D has acted reasonably in damaging or destroying P's property in order to avoid harm to himself or his property

    - **Privilege is qualified or conditional -- D is liable to P for the damage done to P's property. The privilege is conditioned on the privileged party later compensating the P for his use of the property**

      - **It is similar to SL, because even if no negligence, you still pay**

  - **Private necessity ONLY applies if the threatened harm to ship is greater than the harm to the dock. If harm is not greater, you are just a trespasser, no private necessity**.

    - This matters b/c if you are just trespassing, the owner can exclude you.

- [Ploof v. Putnam]{.underline}: Ps sailing on lake when a sudden storm forced them to tie up at D's dock. D then had his servant untie the ship and the boat was destroyed and the Ps were injured.

  - [Held]{.underline}: Privilege of necessity entitled the Ps to tie up at D's dock, so it did not constitute trespass and D did not have the right to exclude them.

  - You could even argue that D trespassed by untying boat because private necessity afforded Ps what amounted to limited property interest in the dock.

- [Vincent v. Lake Erie Transportation Co.:]{.underline} D's ship had been unloading at P's dock when a storm arose. It would have been dangerous for the ship to go out into the storm, so they tied up to P's dock. As the mooring lines parted or chafed, Ds replaced then. P sued for damaged that resulted from the ship bumping against the dock during the storm. Ds argues that it would have been negligent to untie the ship because of the risk to life and ship, and it shouldn't be liable to the damages for the dock.

  - [Held:]{.underline} D had only a conditional privilege, and although D didn't do anything wrong, it saved the ship at the expense of the dock and was liable for the resulting damage.

- Think about: the notion that just because D in Vincent used P's property it should bear liability may seem appealing, but is it persuasive?

  - Why impose property rights? Simply, as between two innocent parties, the one whom nature put at risk should bear the cost of saving himself or his property, rather than the owner of the property saving. Just one explanation

  - But if both parties are not negligent, then the conditional privilege rule looks more like a way to break the moral tie between the parties than a method of achieving corrective justice.

  - Maybe deterrence/resource allocation -- who should be liable? Maybe the property owners are better situated than the Ds to determine best way to prevent damage so they should be liable. Under the Vincent rule, the shipowner always has the incentive to compare risk to the dock if the ship stays moored against the risk to the ship if it doesn't.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               **Trespass**                 **Private Necessity**
  ---------------------------- ---------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Boat damages dock**        Unreasonable, Users pay \$   Reasonable (Harm \< Benefit), Users still pays \$ (conditional privilege)

  **Dock owner unties boat**   Owners don't have to pay     Owners must pay \$ b/c he kicked them off
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **M: Substantial and unreasonable interference with use and enjoyment of land**

  - Substantial = non-trivial

  - Unreasonable = harm vs. cost benefit

  - Interference with use and enjoyment = harm

- Distinct from trespass, tend to be pollution of some form like contamination of water or air, excessive noise, etc.

- Private nuisance: Nuisance that affects particular individuals or entities

  - Land uses inevitably affect each other, so silly claims don't count

  - Once a particular use is more than modestly incompatible with another use, it is a judgment call by courts

    - They "balance the equities"

    - What counts as substantial depends on all circumstances including nature of neighborhood or area in which P and D occupy

    - May be tempting to make arguments based on who had the property first, but this doesn't cover it all and would lead to stupid rules.

- **The finding that something is a nuisance is only the first step of a two-step process of decision that takes place in nuisance actions. Second step requires determination of the remedy that is available once a particular use is held to constitute a nuisance.**

### Coase Theorem and Least Cost Avoider

- Policies to think about with remedies:

- Least cost avoider: **We should impose liability (and obligations to avoid liability) on the party to a transaction who is the one that can fix the problem while incurring the lease cost**

  - In a free market, wherever liability rests, the person who has the most to gain or lose economically will eventually wind up paying

  - But we don\'t live in a world without transaction costs

  - So the answer then is to impose liability on whoever the least cost avoider is - who will incur the least cost to avoid the harm under consideration?

- **Externality**: "Side effect" of something, can be positive or negative

- **Coase theorem: in the absence of transaction costs (costs of identifying potential trading partners, negotiating contracts, monitoring for compliance and so forth) it doesn\'t matter how property rights are allocated.**

  - Ex: law gives factory owner unlimited right to pollute. If pollution does the town\'s residents more harm than the value of what the factory produces, then the citizens will pool their funds and pay the owner to shut it down. If factory has to ask everyone for permission before polluting, then if the factory is economically beneficial, he will cut a deal where he pays the residents for permissions to continue polluting

  - Either way, factory only runs if economically efficient

## Injunctions vs. Damages

- Most tortious activity has concluded by the time an action seeking compensation for losses of the activity has caused reaches the courtroom. Therefore, the only practical remedy is damages

  - **In nuisance, however, often this Is not the case. It is common for nuisance to be continuing at the time of a suit alleging its existence in a trial**

    - **Therefore, two remedies are available**

  - D can pay damages for all past and future losses, but may be permitted to continue the activity that constitutes the nuisance, or

  - Defendant may be ordered to pay P damages for all past losses, and be enjoined from continuing nuisance thereafter

- Court balances equities in determining remedy

  - Take into account variety of factors like

    - Parties respective faults

    - Hardship to the parties in respect of the continuance or discontinuance of the nuisance

    - Value of the activity that constitutes the nuisance

- Court will put liability on the party that can make the harm go away in the cheapest possible way

  - We want to incentivize parties to internalize the cost or precautions

  - Market actors will find a way to get to the least cost even if the liability is on the wrong party.

    - The whole point of the Coase theorem is that this is a simplistic world that doesn't exist

  - In a way, the law doesn't matter. If it doesn't matter who we give liability to, then we should just assume it to the party that satisfies the aims of tort law.

- There is always room for contracting around the law (settlements).

  - In a coase world, we aren't worried about getting to the least cost avoider because we know we will get there anyway, so we use liability to serve other aims of tort law.

- Many courts **routinely grant injunctions** unless the equities weigh decidedly in DF's favor

- Considerations for choosing remedy:

  - The possibility of bargaining:

    - Good possibility (small #, relationship): injunction is good b/c parties will bargain

    - Bad possibility (big #, bilateral monopoly, strangers): damages b/c no bargaining

  - Existence or measurement of damages:

    - When damages don't exist or can't be measured, then damages may be ineffective.

  - Administrative costs

    - Damages require courts to measure damages and that may be costly and erroneous

  - Fairness factors & concerns about CCA

- [Boomer v. Atlantic cement,]{.underline} Court declined to enjoin operation of a cement plant that was important to the economy of the area in which it was located. Cost of discontinuing the nuisance in both dollars and loss of employment was grossly disproportionate to the amount of harm the nuisance was causing.

  - **This doesn't mean that a strict cost benefit analysis happens every case. Many courts grant injunction unless equities weigh decidedly in D\'s favor**

+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

- **Mistakes & Institutional Competence**

- If court gets **damages too high (liability rules)**, then it functions as an injunction.

  - Parties can still bargain.

- If court gets **damages too low (liability rules)**, then it functions like no liability, but parties can still bargain & work it out

  - Here, if bargaining won't work (conditions are bad for bargaining), court should be extra concerned about getting damages right.

- If court gets **injunction wrong,** parties can still bargain it out, but since PL & DF can demand a lot of money, may lead to strategic holdouts, **extortion**, etc.

- Even if court makes a mistake, doesn't foreclose bargaining for more efficient outcome (Coase), assuming limitations of Coase theorem

- [Spurs v. Del Webb:]{.underline} PL is property developer, found to have come to the nuisance b/c he moves to place where there is a feed-lot & sues for nuisance due to flies and odor. Court rules that PL may enforce his property right (get injunction), but must pay DF for the cost of moving the feed lot.

  - Justification: PL could have foreseen this nuisance & took advantage of cheaper land values of rural area to build, so should pay for those forced to leave.

  - Holding is limited to where the developer foreseeably came to land and made it necessary to grant an injunction against a lawful business, and that business has no adequate relief.

### Permanent Injunction

- Permanent Injunction should be granted as act of equitable discretion by district court and reviewable on appeal for abuse of discretion.

  - Courts should balance the equities to determine whether to allow an injunction:

    - Respective parties\' faults

    - Hardship to parties in respect of continuing or discontinuance of the nuisance

    - Value of the activity that constitutes the nuisance to the surrounding community

- Equity 4-factor test:

  - Will suffer irreparable harm (can't be fixed by monies)

  - Remedies at law (damages) are inadequate to compensate for injury

  - Balance of hardships btwn PL and DF -- is injunction warranted?

  - Public interest should not be disserviced by granting of injunction

- Factors 3 and 4 build ability for you to make any argument you want

- This is a very standards-like test

<!-- -->

- [Ebay v. MercExchange]{.underline} (SCOTUS 2006) (Patent infringement on the \"Buy It Now\" patent held by MercExchange, infringed by Ebay. Ebay tried to license patent from MercExchange but could not reach an agreement. In patent suit, jury found patent was valid, that petitioners had infringed the patent, and damages were appropriate, but MercExchange wanted injunction too.)

  - Court says patents that are infringed should not automatically get permanent injunction.

  - Traditional 4-factor test should be applied.

  - **Majority**

    - 4-factor test is tradition and should not depart from it.

    - Patents are personal property, and do have right to exclude, but right to exclude is not same as a right to an injunction

    - Should be decided **case-by-case** if courts should grant injunction in patent suits

    - Leans standards

  - **Roberts Concurring**

    - Courts generally granted injunctive for most patent infringement cases b/c usually patent property right implicates first 2 factors of test 🡪 doesn't favor idea of courts setting a price for patent w/ damages b/c unfair to inventor in garage that only makes money by selling inventions 🡪 drags inventor into courts to battle for price of patent when market should set the price

    - But patent owner is not entitled to permanent injunction or justify a general rule.

    - Looks at history and leans to rules. Guidance on how to apply test by looking at how past cases came out.

  - **Kennedy Concurring**

    - Concerned about patent trolls - an injunction can be employed as a bargaining tool to charge exorbitant fees to companies that seek to buy licenses to practice the patent.

    - Also considering the burgeoning number of patents over business methods and their consequences, the potential **vagueness** and **suspect validity** of some patents may affect 4-factor calculus. 🡪 concerned about modern tech and how times are changing

    - History is good and all but it may not be much of a guide now

## Compensatory Damages

- Awarding damages for torts performs at least three functions:

  - Corrective justice or civil recourse for compensating P for losses from D's conduct

  - Promoting deterrence by threatening potential future Ds with liability

  - Recognizing social and individual significant of P's loss and confirming the weight of D's responsibility for it

- General rule for compensatory damages: P is entitled to be made whole

  - Property damages: Measured by loss in value of property or cost to repair or replace, whichever is loss

    - P may also recover damages for consequential loss, such as diminished profits

  - Bodily injury: P can get economic costs of medical bills, lost earnings, can also get non-economic costs for P&S

  - All tort law can do is retroactively pay P for the damage (similar to ED in contracts)

- Which aims of tort law does compensatory damages serve:

  - Corrective justice: acknowledge P's injury and who is at fault -- "right the wrong"

  - Deterrence: Prevent future Ds from injuring future Ps

    - Aim is optimal deterrence where actors think on society's behalf

    - Want people to weigh cost and benefits and decide what reasonable person should do (similar to BPL)

  - Civil recourse: Draw attention to exactly what D did to P and what that was worth. Accuracy is important here b/c we want to specifically recognize P's injury

- **Same rules governing burden to prove elements of P\'s claim apply to proof of damages**

  - P must prove by a preponderance that she has suffered or will suffer the losses which she claims

- In the American tort system, P can only recover once

  - Provides compensation for past and future loss

  - Pros: Case ends, cheaper for courts, closure for P, repose for D

  - Cons: Less accuracy in estimating future damages than there would be in determinations made periodically as losses are incurred. P must be good investor or else won't have award when she needs it in the future.

  - Corollary of single recovery is the rule that there is no independent cause of action for losses that have not yet occurred

  - Once tangible physical loss has taken place, then compensation for all future losses that will more probably than not result from that loss is also recoverable

    - But if no physical loss has yet occurred, the fact that P will more probably than not suffer physical loss in the future ordinarily is not actionable

    - Limited exception when D has tortiously exposed P to risk of suffering injury such as cancer where P might get costs for medical monitoring (ex: NFL settlement)

    - Aside from this, liability for future loss must wait until physical injury actually occurs

- Components that are typically counted as being part of compensatory damages:

  - Economic factors

    - Lost earnings

    - Medical expenses

    - Property loss

    - Etc.

  - Non-economic factors

    - Pain and suffering

    - Loss of companionship

    - Etc.

- Modern tort law still has rigid barriers for what P is allowed to get.

  - Also sometimes statutory caps

- Things that are NOT counted as being part of compensatory damages:

  - Pure economic loss

  - Pure emotional loss

- Calculating compensatory damages:

  - [Matsuyama]{.underline}: Court calculates for last chance; not just lost wages and expenses, but the value of the lost chance of survival if the doctor hadn't been negligent/noticed cancer earlier.

    - Think of aims of tort law: civil recourse, corrective justice, etc.

    - Is it possible to value pain and suffering? It won't be the same for everyone, subjective, but we try anyway

- Artificial limits on damages or liability:

  - Race and gender: Experts rely on Bureau of labor stats that determine damages based on demographics. This is obviously controversial, leads to some life being valued less

    - Idea is that this is supposed to quantify and increase accuracy. But this may not work because of things like SAHM or others that contribute a lot societally but don't make money that reflects this.

    - We don't want to reproduce real world biases in our aspirational calculations.

    - Think of the outcomes of this: Maybe Ds then build factories in neighborhoods of color b/c they know they'll pay less if they injure. Or maybe attorneys shouldn't take on minority Ps.

### Pain and suffering

- **Must be linked to bodily injury**

- Function: acknowledges the wrong done to P and the fact that P has experienced intangible losses. P may also be able to use money for activities or enjoyment that substitute for those lost as a result of the injury in question. Plus we want to deter causing pain and suffering. Provides P money to pay atty fees too if she prevails

- Limitations: hard to predict for jury.

  - **Remittitur:** way to restrict awards. Jury award is in excess of what reasonably jury could award in light of all the evidence, so trial court gives P a choice between a new trial and acceptance of a specified reduction in the award.

  - **Additur:** similar but for when award is unduly low

  - **Courts reluctant to apply these unless egregious jury error**

  - Problem posed for those who want to control awards for pain and suffering is to develop standards of limitation that are both fair and workable. **Hard to satisfy both fairness and workability at same time.**

    - Half states place absolute dollar ceiling, but this could be unfair to victim if their pain and suffering is more than the ceiling imposed for all of the jurisdiction

- **It is black letter law that pain and suffering cannot be awarded in cases involving property damage**

- Calculating pain and suffering -- think of the activity we did using Core Parks and Rec facts

  - So arbitrary, depending on the different ways you are asked to value P's life, you come with different amounts

- Tort law can only give you money, it can't fix everything.

- **Are there ways to constrain the awards (place some guidelines) without making them inaccurate?**

### Pure emotional and pure economic harm

- **Pure emotional loss:** No liability for pure emotional loss when there is no physical injury suffered b/c anything can be an emotional loss (opens floodgates to litigation) and would be too vulnerable to fraud

  - Counter: in criminal law, juries often assess credibility, so why can't they do that here?

  - Emotional loss would require standards of reasonable care that don't exist

  - And legal resources are limited, should save resources for victims of physical injury.

- **Pure economic loss:** Must have property or personal damage to recover economic losses.

  - If there is personal/property damage, then you can collect for other, separate injuries too

  - Worried about crushing liability if we allow for pure economic losses (think BP case)

  - Policy: recognizes the policy-driven line of avoiding too much liability is arbitrary and does cut off liability to foreseeable P, but says foreseeability is not limiting enough

    - Ways to limit: geography, PC, Contract, amount of loss

- [532 Madison]{.underline}: Pure economic loss. Dunlop plant got hit with rocks, but got to sue for everything, incl. lost profits, power outage, etc. All damage that Chevy plant suffered as well, but Chevy can't recover. Judge draws arbitrary line to cut off the damages somewhere, even though both have largely suffered similar damages/losses.

  - [Foreseeability of harm does not define duty]{.underline} -- must be some injury, otherwise no limit.

  - Maybe court is worried about opening the floodgates of litigation if people like Chevy are able to sue in tort for pure economic loss

  - Who is deciding here? Judge -- court specifies that no matter how foreseeable, just as a matter of law, one cannot recover under these circumstances.

- [Exxon v. Baker]{.underline}: Landowners, Native Alaskans, commercial fishermen suing to recover economic losses caused by dependency on the body of water. Earlier suits did compensatory.

### Statutory Damages

- Statutory limits set range within which jury might use fact-finding to determine how much should be awarded

  - Ex: Copyright act sets limit of 150k per song ceiling on damages for illegal file sharing suits

- Are we worried that a statutory range would push the jury to award something much higher or lower than what they might otherwise deem appropriate?

  - This is what we see in the file sharing case.

  - Damages were 2.2k per shared song. In such a case, P might think that statutory damages are the way to go. But is this reasonable?

  - District Court Judge knocked down amount as unreasonably high

  - But First Circuit reinstated the high award as within the statutory range, which allowed a much higher cap (150k a track). 2.2k per song almost seemed low in light of the much higher cap under the copyright act.

    - First circuit said that district court abused their discretion and should have used remittitur to give P choice of either accepting lower award or going to trial again

- P chooses to opt in to the statutory damages limits rather than asking for damages for lost profits, etc. If you do, there is a max and min. Moving parts with mental state of infringer.

  - The range gives structure and guidance to how and where the numbers should be

  - You can go for the certainty of the statutory damages if you are worried about how you'd show you lost or will lose some amount of money or wellbeing

  - Issues: One size fits all, it's not very tailored to P's damage, and still can very a lot

## Punitive Damages

- Tort law generally only allows compensatory damages, but sometimes will allow punitives if the aims serve it

  - In exceptional cases

  - The threat of them being award may do more than them actually being awarded

  - States vary in descriptions of behavior that warrants these but almost always it needs to be more than GN

- Purposes

  - **Deter:** Optimal deterrence vs. absolute

    - Idea is that tortfeasor is insufficiently deterred by compensatory

    - Puts the thumb on the scale to alter D's cost benefit analysis in undertaking activity or implementing safeguards

    - Optimal deterrence: you break, you pay -- make D internalize externalities and spillover harms

  - **Punish**

    - Most jdx require recklessness or worse for punitives

    - We use intuition to decide how much to punish D for his actions. We want to represent how bad his bevhaior was.

- Judicial concerns about unpredictability of PD (unfair and lack of deterrence)

  - How decided?

    - Judge decides with jury instructions from judge guiding it

      - Juries get the basic instructions after the lawyers have presented arguments to them

      - Courts then look at common law and due process of constitution to decide what goes in JI and whether ultimate award "shocks the conscience"

    - Judges can review and remit punitives on common law ("shocks the conscience") or constitutional law

  - SCOTUS has reviewed punitives in some cases in response to D's claim that they violate due process

    - They've set three factors to use in evaluating constitutionality of punitives:

      - Degree of reprehensibility of D's conduct

      - Disparity or proportion between harm or potential harm resulting from D's conduct and the amount of punitives

      - Difference between this remedy and the civil or criminal penalties authorized to punish Ds in comparable cases

    - First and third factors are a matter of judgment

      - [State Farm v. Campbell]{.underline}: Judge quantified second factor and held that few awards in which there was more than a single digit ratio between punitives and compensatory that would satisfy due process

      - Punitive damages that are more than 9x greater than compensatory are presumptively unconstitutional

- Huang: Surprisingly Punitive Damages

  - Idea that unexpectedly excessive damages may arise through redundant punitives where a D gets sued by multiple Ps in different suits for the same bad act and gets punished in each one so they add up to be borderline unconstitutional

  - Huang's solution: allow courts to run concurrently the fixed component of the repeated awards

    - Courts review compensatories as a variable component in each suit, and punitives are fixed and run only concurrently with those awarded by other courts.

  - **Think if your own limiting principles for punitives**

- [Exxon v. Baker]{.underline} (maritime law)

  - While transporting 1M barrels of oil, Captain Hazelwood was drunk and left to do "paperwork" when he should have been steering the ship to use a common maneuver to get around ice. The ship hit a reef, and 200k barrels spilled. Exxon knew Hazelwood had an alcohol problem.

    - Exxon is vicariously liable for Captain Hazelwood's N

  - Many lawsuits (1.5B): environmental (fed/state), private individuals (fishermen, tourism)

    - Exxon admits N and pays 500M in compensatory damages to individuals

    - Exxon disputes punitives

  - Held:

    - District Court judge: Exxon/Hazelwood reckless (or worse). Jury Finds 5B in punitives (10x Compensatories).

    - 9^th^ Circuit: Remands to consider other SCOTUS cases. District court keeps PD at 5B. 9^th^ circuit then lowers to 2.5B (5x compensatories).

    - SCOTUS takes the case and limit punitives to 500M (1x compensatories) based on studying past punitive cases

      - [Benefits of the upper limit ratio: somewhat serves the aim of predictability in punitive damages, serves judicial economy because probably less appeals]{.mark}

      - Critiques: rigid, each case is different. If D gets lucky and gets a P who didn't have many compensatory damages, it doesn't change how much is needed to punish and deter D's conduct, might not help deterrence because D knows that no matter what, it would never be higher than the limit. D may decide it's a risk worth taking.

- [Philip Morris v. Williams]{.underline}

  - Williams' widow sues PM b/c Williams smoked their cigarettes for many years while PM contended for years that cigarettes don't cause lung cancer. Williams trusted them. He died from lung cancer after a fairly short fight.

  - Procedural posture: OR state court trial awarded 800k in CD and 80M in PD (100:1). Trial judge lowers PD. OR appellate court reinstates 80M PD. OR S.Ct. decided not to hear the case. SCOTUS remands case to OR S.Ct. to reconsider the award in light of recent SCOTUS decision in State Farm. OR Appellate court again approves 80M in PD. OR S.Ct. takes case and approves 80M in PD. SCOTUS rules juries can only consider similar harm to others for reprehensibility (not punishment) and remands to OR S.Ct.

  - [Held:]{.underline} In calculating punitive damages and applying the State Farm guideposts, juries can consider the harm to absent parties when they are evaluating factor (1), reprehensibility of conduct. However, they cannot directly punish D for harm to absent parties.

# Mass Torts

## Class Actions and Issues Classes

- Reasons for class actions: Efficiency, incentive to sue, consistency, global peace

- FRCP 23(a) -- Class Certification

  - Must meet all four

    - Numerosity: Joinder impractical, usually 100+ people

    - Commonality: Question or law or fact common to class

    - Typicality

    - Adequate Representation

  - The last 2 sections combined, whether named Ps are representative of the whole class.

- FRCP 23(b) -- Type of class

  - Pick ONE

    - B3: Mandatory Classes

      - Inconsistency (worried about D being given conflicting orders from court)

      - Limited Fund (D might run out of money)

      - Injunction (one solution for all, like *Brown*)

    - B3: Catchall/Opt-Out

      - Damages -- common question predominates over individuals, class action is the superior method

    - C4: Issues class

      - Action can be brought/maintained as class action with respect to particular issues (loophole Post-Walmart)

- [Walmart v. Dukes]{.underline} (SCOTUS) -- Class Actions attempted as B2 but court said needs to be B3, failed commonality

  - Three named Ps suing on behalf of 1.5 million women who were employed at Walmart during a period of time. Class worked in 3,400 stores, with different jobs (hourly, wage, management), and different harms (pay, promotions, harassment). Asked for B2 class (injunctive relief, back-pay)

  - [Held]{.underline}: SCOTUS (9-0) said that the claims for monetary damages must be done through B3, not B2. No individualized amounts through B2, but only "incidental money." SCOTUS (5-4) says class does not meet commonality requirement under A2. For A2, must have something like "same injury," "common contention," "glue," or "common answers"

  - [Dissent]{.underline}: RBG -- this looks like a B3 requirement that you're importing into the A requirements. Don't eliminate the class before they even get the chance to begin. Reaching too far -- just solve the type of class issue.

  - [Takeaway]{.underline}: Major implications for mass torts cases. For example, an oil spill results in many different injuries (lost profits, destroyed property, health issues). When will mass torts ever have a common injury?

    - Before this case, commonality was a "throwaway" -- thought as basic question and not controversial

- [Martin v. Behr Dayton]{.underline} (6^th^ Cir.) -- Issues Class

  - 30 names Ps (class of 500) are property owners claiming that chemicals from Ds companies are going into the groundwater, creating dangerous vapors. Court rejects 23B3 class b/c injury is individualized (no predominance). District court and circuit court certify some issues under 23C4 (under the broad view).

  - [Takeaway]{.underline}: Once you resolve common issues under 23C4 (like causation), then each P can individually sue and prove individualized injuries. Will likely lead to settlement.

    - Once you answer the issue of whether Ds caused contamination, then you can move to individual suits to ask whether the contamination caused injuries to each P

  - [Broad view]{.underline}: Can make issue classes first before assessing predominance (23B3) -- easy to meet

  - [Narrow view]{.underline}: Prohibits issue classing if predominance has not been satisfied for the cause of action as a whole. Must meet 23B3 before using 23C4 (rejected by 6^th^ circuit).

## Settlements

- Settlement is a voluntary dismissal by P.

- In a typical lawsuit, one can settle a case at any time, Court has no input on it.

- **In class actions, FRCP 23(e)(2) requires judge to approve settlements.** **Can still settle at any time.**

  - **Factors just applies to decide (standards)**

    - Fair

    - Reasonable

    - Adequate

  - **FRCP 23(e)(4): Requires that if the class is certified as a B3 class, members of the class get a new opportunity to be excluded/opt out if they don't want to be part of the settlement.**

  - **FRCP 23(e)(5)(a): Provides that any class member can object to approval of the settlement.**

  - Ex: NFL Concussion settlement -- Judge Brody

    - Judge asked NFL to revise settlement twice to uncap total amount of damages paid for conditions, and then to remove the limit on how much could be spent on medical monitoring

  - Judge has to be involved here b/c someone has to look out for absentees, sweetheart deals, etc.

  - Remember: in settlements, you can include distinctions that may be more difficult to do in court.

- **You can certify a class just for settlement.** This means that at the same time the Ps attorney walks into court with the papers to certify a class, they are walking in with the deal.

## Multi-District Litigation (MDLs)

- Basics:

  - Federal court

  - Set up by congress (by statute)

  - Exploded in use in recent years

  - Must have a common question of fact

    - Less hard to satisfy this than in a class action, it's just about practicality, judicial economy, fairness

  - Panel of 7 judges choose which district and which judge will hear the case (but it's often a judge that was already hearing one, and one that is convenient for most Ps)

  - Ps will have different lawyers (individual lawyers supposed to look out for own client's interests), and then judge picks the "lead" lawyers

  - Not a class action, we don't need representative Ps or certifications

    - But Class actions can be pulled into MDL

    - Ps have 20 days to file a brief in response to the motion to transfer

  - Cannot do a trial in MDL, only pre-trial

    - MDL judge will conduct discovery, pre-trial motions, some dismissals, and some summary judgment on common questions

    - A bunch of mini trials which give info about who would win and lose in actual trial, and info on how much to settle for.

  - In theory, the cases get remanded back to their original district for trial, because MDL court cannot actually conduct trial (which never happens in practice, parties usually just settle)

  - **Judge doesn't have to approve settlement**

- **Ex: Vioxx Lawsuits**

  - Hundreds of individual class actions filed in federal courts against Merck blaming its painkiller Vioxx for deaths and injuries got consolidated in federal court in New Orleans

  - Merck settled the lawsuits for 4.85 billion

    - Settled 27k lawsuits

    - Deal becomes binding only after 85% of Ps agree to drop their cases and take the deal

    - Ps will get different settlement payments depending on severity of injuries and how long they took the drug

    - Ps who don't want the settlement can pursue their own claim but it would be hard with so many top trial lawyers agreeing to the deal

- **Compensation Funds**

  - Can be a form of settlement

  - Usually used to divvy up a fixed amount

  - Administrator of compensation fund can make individualized assessments of what damages are most appropriate

    - Acts as "factfinder" which may be more simple than court

    - Can get pure economic and pure emotional loss depending on the administrator

      - Post 9/11 fund, Feinberg accounted for pure economic b/c he likes the compensatory aspect of tort law

  - Compensation fund can compensate for areas court may not typically allow

    - Ex: Cause of actions barred by SOL (Catholic Church)

      - They just felt like doing something nice?

    - Ex: 9/11 fund, administrator compensated victims for future income, but also added fixed amount for P&S

  - These are essential to mass torts because it means that we see less cases.

## BP Oil Spill Litigation and Settlement

- Recall facts from earlier reading of Deepwater Horizon

- Impacts on people

  - Lots of people living down by bayou, seafood industry, tourism

  - This is who they make a. living, now have nothing and no income

  - Even if their food isn't contaminated, everything thinks it was and won't eat

    - Perception by public is impacting industry

  - People that are only tangentially related (like the net manufacturers in Alaska that now sell less b/c the fishermen in the gulf can't fish, or the hotel owners in FL) are also suffering losses

    - Domino effect in the economy, all kinds of businesses claiming loss

- Initially, BP sets up compensation fund w/ 20 Billion run by Feinberg

  - But it's slow, having a hard time, not going well

  - He's trying to get people to take the money instead of suing him, but some still decide to sue for:

    - Economic loss

    - Medical issues

    - Civil/criminal investigation ongoing by gov't

- MDL consolidated with 300+ lawyers (committee of attys)

  - Cases that were already brought, not a class action with absent Ps

- BP decides to settle right before trial b/c BP was afraid of publicity

  - Parties create a class action with the MDL and settlement

  - They make it a universal global settlement where they propose a class and settle concurrently

    - Recall, judge must review settlement for fair, adequate, reasonable

  - The settlement sets up a new compensation fund

    - Part of the money comes from previous one

    - New administrator (they fire Ken), Juneau

    - Judge retains supervision of the fund, so judge becomes Juneau's boss

- Settlement terms:

  - No cap

  - No proof of causation

- BP panics, it's a lot more expensive than they thought

  - They go to judge and have objectors come in and say that Juneau is abusing and it's now illegitimate

    - The judge says it's not unreasonable or invalid, they agreed to this

    - In a way, parties are providing alternative "evidence" of causation b/c it makes parties attest that they were telling the truth

    - This is more flexible/administrable than litigation

      - Created settlement that cover everyone by allowing massive processing of claims

- January 2014 Opinion:

  - BP challenges class certification and says that it certified people that weren't injured

    - Argues class doesn't meet commonality, adequacy, predominance

    - Court says that BP doesn't make sense, they brought it late and can't change now

    - On commonality: same injury requirement can be satisfied by D's conduct

      - You need a common contention but it doesn't necessarily need to be true upon certification

    - On predominance: they could solve that with a C4 class and find issues that doe predominate (Martin's broad view) and certify

    - Essentially, judge says "there's so many reasons to do class action, so let's make it work"

  - Can what happens in settlement feed back into the class and destroy it?

    - Court says no, certification is to protect class for litigation. Now all we have is settlement, can't destroy class now

- How would you improve settlement?

  - Broad coverage -- even not obvious connections can be let in

  - Community level harm: entire economies hurt, maybe develop a tier system to address more pressing/direct harms first

  - Bring in outside experts

  - Have government oversee it -- Gov't pays out of pocket when mass torts happen, and then D owes gov't so that individual people aren't starving to death

    - Also a lot harder for BP to screw over gov't than it is for them to screw over the little guy fishers in the bayou

# Policy Ideas

- **Reasonable person is white**: what are the implications for those that are not born and socialized in American/Western societies? What about those that are less affluent? We assume people are able to make the cost-benefit analysis as the reasonable person does, but doesn't this require them to have access to insurance, money sense, and the ability to accept some risks?

- **Who decides who decides**? Points of tort law where issues are narrowed or taken from juries where we might think that the jurors, as community members, have a larger stake in deciding the case at hand:

  - Rules vs. standards in the railroad cases: judges tried to apply RPS as a rule and jury didn't get it

  - Strict liability: Posner and Doerr make it seem like it's up to the judge to decide, don't we want community members deciding this since imposing SL is a community-oriented decision?

  - Punitives: SCOTUS adding more guidelines for what jurors can consider, and judges deciding to use remittitur or other jury control devices to have the final say

  - Duty: Judges decide duty, and judges can take a causal issue away from the jurors (palsgraf) to control the outcome

  - Allowing external markers into RPS: we constrain jurors on what they can consider in deciding what the reasonable person would do. If so much of tort law is centered around the reasonable person, why not let the reasonable people have free reign?

- **Issues that run against common sense:** property owner pays for kicking person off property if private necessity, no pure emotional loss, no subjective standard for mental ailments, no liability for negligence if no one is hurt, we punish you more if you deliberately did something versus if you just had no idea you were being dumb, imposing affirmative duty on person who undertakes rescue to do it well, no duty to rescue

- **Potential for over punishing if defendant gets sued and pays punitives multiple times**

- **No lost chance recovery if you don't die**
