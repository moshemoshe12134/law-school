**[TORTS OUTLINE]{.underline}**

**BIG IDEAS**

1)  **[COMPETING AIMS OF TORT LAW]{.mark}**

- Thinking about who should pay

  - Human argument -- the blameworthy party, who knew about the risk, who *can* pay / who is insured?

  - Policy arguments -- let losses lie where they fall, culture of safety, known risk, give incentives to people for how to act?

  - Legalistic arguments -- easy default rule /precedent?

I.  **CORRECTIVE JUSTICE** -- *D focused, ex post: Why DF is obligated to pay PL*

    a.  When one party wrongs another, correction of the wrong helps restore moral balance

    b.  Intentional w=Wrongdoer = most obvious occasion for Corrective Justice

    c.  *How* compensation happens changes the strength of the argument:

        i.  Strong when an individual compensates another individual face to face.

        ii. Weak when the connection between injurer and victim becomes less direct. (*Insurance, corporation -- no longer face to face)*

II. **CIVIL RECOURSE** -- *P focused, ex post: Why P is entitled to Receive*

    a.  Tort law gives victims a chance to have the fact that they've been wronged recognized.

    b.  Vindicates this need in a manner proportional to the seriousness of both the wrong and the injury (\$)

III. **OPTIMAL DETERRENCE** -- *Community focused, ex ante*

     a.  We want to deter excessively risky behavior -- only want to avoid those losses worth avoiding

         i.  The law *does* tolerate losses that result from some risky activities.

         ii. 🡪Negligence requirement implies that some losses are worth avoiding and some are not

     b.  Nothing in the principle of Optimal Deterrence dictates what values should be taken into account in determining *which* losses are and and are not worth deterring.

         i.  Economic Calculus -- B \_\_ P\*L ignores human values

IV. **LOSS DISTRIBUTION**

    a.  DFs spread out their liability (e.g. through insurance, raising prices for their products, or through shareholders)

    b.  Having a larger \# of people bear small losses \> having a single person bear a large loss. This aim does not suggest a limit.

V.  **COMPENSATION**

    a.  Help to return the victims to the state they were in before the accident. Not to provide compensation for the victims.

    b.  Try to reduce the risk of socially productive activities (benefit, not goal); make us feel secure

VI. **REDRESS OF SOCIAL GRIEVANCES**

    a.  Right to sue promotes redress of social grievances especially against large, impersonal institutions. Ordinary people can put authority on trial.

2)  **[The 4 Elements Needed for a Cause of Action in Tort]{.mark}**

<!-- -->

(1) **DUTY** (the legal duty to comply with a particular standard of care)

(2) **BREACH of Duty** (failure to comply with the applicable standard of care)

(3) **CAUSATION**

(4) **DAMAGES**

<!-- -->

3)  **Moral Luck**

4)  **Statutes**

    a.  **Common law uses statutes to determine *breach***

        - Per se N if you breach a statute

    b.  **Common law uses statutes to determine *duty***

        - *Cuyler --* Navy child abuse case

    c.  **Common law uses statutes to determine *damages***

    d.  **Statutes incorporate Common law** (Clean Water Act in BP, FTCA) **\~\***

    e.  **Federal statutes can replace (preempt) state common law**

    - There are 3 types -- express, implied (field of conflict)

    - **Medtronic, Inc. v. Stengel:** Whether the Medical Device Amendment to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act preempt a state law claim alleging that a medical device manufacturer violated a duty under federal law to report adverse-event information to the FDA.

      - Federal requirement: tell FDA if anything is dangerous

      - State law: failure to warn by not telling the FDA

      - MDA: \[explicit preemption\] what is preempted to those that are different or in addition to

      - Court decided that State Law did not require more -- the behavioral requirement was the same, though the state law added on damages

      - 2 Exceptions -- (1) Must have been a traditional State Law 🡪 cannot make one up now. (2) Whether Congress signaled its intent to take over the area (e.g. field preemption) and no conflict preemption because it is parallel.

5)  **[ECONOMIC THEORIES OF TORT LAW]{.mark}**

    a.  **Cheapest Cost Avoider v. 1**

        - *Explanation of CCA* **\~\***

        - What's Missing?

          1.  Morality, risk spreading

          2.  Why is it All of Nothing? Why not split the liability?

          3.  Why are we so limited to shifting arbitrary numbers around?

    b.  **Cheapest Cost Avoider v. 2**

        - Who best knows how to get the parties together/Who best knows how to bargain?

> 🡪 Put the liability on them. (Dock Owners vs. Ship Owners.)

c.  **Coase Theorem**

    - In a world without transaction costs, law does not matter because parties will bargain to the right outcome.

6)  **[RULES vs. STANDARDS]{.mark}**

When do we want to switch regimes? *If a fact situation is recurring, rules could be useful.*

Who decides? (Judges v. Juries) (Courts v. Legislatures) Institutional competencies, trust, information?

**[RULE]{.mark}**

**Baltimore & Ohio RR v. Goodman** (1927). **F:** P's decedent killed when D's train hit his truck. P's view was obscured so he slowed down approaching tracks.

**H:** D not liable for injuries. **R:** P assumes risk of injury when danger is foreseeable and P does not take extra precaution (ordinary care is not sufficient here). Establishes a **rule** -- higher standard of care. P must take every possible precaution when crossing, including *getting out of the car and checking.*

Due care generally a question for Jury, but where standard of duty is clear, Court can decide.

- Holmes: Judges should use their experience to make decisions when it is clear from past cases what outcome should be; they should lay down guidelines rather than allow an oscillating jury to decide. Recurring fact pattern 🡪 make rule for consistency of results.

**[STANDARD]{.mark}**

**Pokora v. Wabash Railway** (1934). **F:** P drove truck across railroad crossing and had obscured view by boxcars so was hit by train. He stopped and listened before but heard no train coming. **H:** Ruled in favor of P. Reversed Goodman. **R:** Jury should decide whether P's action (relying on hearing and not sight) was reasonable given the circumstances. Cardozo cautions against making standards of behavior into rules of law and applying to every circumstance. (This limits *Goodman* which imposes standard application by the judge -- there, P may have been contributorily negligent as a matter of law given facts of the case, but that does not mean everyone who hasn't stopped, listened and gotten out is contributorily negligent!). Getting out of car to check is unnecessary & dangerous as it may *increase* risk.

**Negligence: BREACH**

To **show [D did not exercise reasonable care]{.underline}**: prove some less obvious **precaution or safety measure** that was **available, inexpensive, and potentially effective!**
