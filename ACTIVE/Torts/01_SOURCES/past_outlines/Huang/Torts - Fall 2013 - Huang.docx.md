**NEGLIGENCE**

**Duty of Reasonable Care**

- [Brown v. Kendall]{.underline} (Kendall accidently injured Brown while trying to separate their fighting dogs with a stick)

  - Landmark case where negligence comes from (disputed).

  - A party is liable for damages caused by if it fails to use **ordinary care**. (This is when "fault" matters).

  - Dicta: Contributory negligence as a defense.

  - [Burden of proof:]{.underline} The plaintiff has the burden of proof to show that the defendant did not use ordinary care.

- [Adams v. Bullock]{.underline} (Bullock owned trolley line with overhead wire system. Boy (Adams) injures himself when a long wire he was swinging hit the overhead wire below a bridge)

  - Ordinary caution does not involve forethought of extraordinary peril.

  - Only **"reasonable" care** required 🡪 saves costly further (extraordinary) care.

  - Not mentioned by Cardozo: could have just put up a warning sign or made fence higher.

- [United States v. Carroll Towing Co.]{.underline} (Improperly secured barge drifts away from pier, damaging other boats and sinking itself (contained cargo of US Gov't. Issue is whether bargee had duty to be on boat (if he was on it, boat would not have sunk))

  - **Learned Hand Formula:** Duty to take precaution if **B \< P x L**

    - Breach of duty if the burden (cost) of taking adequate precautions is less than the probable marginal cost (to society) of not taking precautions (probability of loss x gravity of loss).

    - **Rationales:** Efficiency (Posner), Utilitarian

    - Negatives: **Incommensurability**

  - Facts of the case that showed lack of reasonable care: accident occurred during working hours, during a high traffic time and bad weather. Bargee didn't have an excuse.

- [Bethel v. New York City Transit Authority]{.underline} (Bethel injured in NYC bus when wheel chair seat collapsed)

  - Common carriers do not have a duty to increased standard of care 🡪 basic negligence standard of ordinary care applies.

**Objective/Subjective Standard**: It's a trade off.

- If you hold everyone to an objective standard, then you no longer would have duty to take into account other people' capacities when making your own decisions. 🡪 No incentive to increase care around people with decreased capacities.

- However, maybe people with lower capacities should decrease activity levels. Objective standards incentivize this.

**Mental Capacity**

- Mental ability is not a valid defense. Standard of negligence is objective.

**Physical Capacity**

- Held to same standard as reasonable person with same physical disability (Restatement).

**Children**

- [Dellwo v. Person]{.underline} (Defendant injured plaintiff while driving motorboat)

  - A child should be held to the standard of care of an adult when engaging in **adult activities** (exception).

  - People can anticipate that the conduct of a child engaged in children's activities may not reach an adult standard of care. However, much more difficult to establish that a driver of a vehicle is a minor so people can't protect themselves.

  - Children should not be participating in adult activities in the first place if they are incapable of adult standard of care.

  - Unanswered: What constitutes an adult activity (clues given).

**Emergencies:** One need only exercise basic reasonableness in judgment (lower standard)

- Issues: What constitutes an emergency? Should this be a rule or a standard (if there is an emergency doctrine)?

- FORK: Some states are getting rid of emergency doctrine and replacing it with general negligence standard (makes sense).

**Res Ipsa Loquitur**

- [Byrne v. Boadle]{.underline} (Byrne was hit by a barrel of flour but couldn't remember what happened)

  - If there is no direct evidence, liability for negligence can lie solely on account of that type of accident that occurred. As long as the plaintiff can show that accident was such that the plaintiff was probably negligent (**by a preponderance of the evidence**) then the burden of proof passes to the defendant.

- [McDougald v. Perry]{.underline} (McDougald was injured when a spare tire flew off Perry's triler and hit McDougald's windshield)

  - Res ipsa loquitur applies when the instrument which caused the injury was under the **exclusive control** of the defendant and some sort of **negligence was required** for the accident to occur.

**Custom**

- [The TJ Hooper]{.underline} (General practice was for tug boats not to have radios)

  - There are precautions so imperative that even their universal disregard (custom) will not excuse their omission.

  - **General practice doesn't necessarily connote lack of negligence**.

- [Timarco v. Klein]{.underline} (Glass door to bathtub shattered injuring plaintiff. Door was made of regular glass despite the common practice of using shatterproof glass.)

  - **Evidence of compliance/noncompliance with custom can be used as evidence but is not dispositive.**

- Certain professions, including the medical professions, are held to a higher standard of care 🡪 reasonable standard of care for someone in their field. Violation of professional custom by someone in one of these fields constitutes negligence.

**Negligence per se:** Unexcused violation of a statute designed to promote safety.

- FORK: A minority of states hold that violation of a statue is not negligent per se, but evidence of such violation is admissible and relevant.

<!-- -->

- [Martin v. Herzog]{.underline} (Martin was killed when Herzog negligently crashed into his buggy (driving over center line). Martin's buggy had no lights in violation of a statute)

  - To omit, willfully or heedlessly (through thoughtlessness), the **safeguards** **prescribed by law for the benefit of others**, is to fall short of one's duty of care (negligent per se).

  - Jury not permitted to decide whether violation of statute was negligent (assumed unless ∆ has excuse)

    - Per se = negligent as a matter of law.

  - Liable for harm caused if harm was the type the statute was meant to prevent (see defense of limited statutory purpose below).

- [Tedla v. Ellman]{.underline} (Two junk collectors were hit by a negligently driven car while walking on the right side of the road despite statute that says the walk on the left side. Left side had lots of traffic while the right side did not)

  - When a statutory rule of conduct fixes no definite standard of care, which would in all cases increase safety, **one is negligent only if he fails to observe the statute without good reason** (exception to negligence per se).

  - **Legally cognizable excuses** (opaque)

    - \(1\) necessity

    - \(2\) emergency

    - \(3\) incapacity

    - \*Also, defense of limited statutory purpose

      - Plaintiff wasn't in class of persons, or didn't suffer the type of harm, statute was meant to protect

      - Really hard to prove since statutes can be (and often are by modern courts) construed to be intended to protect unstated secondary beneficiaries.

- **Compliance:** All states hold that evidence of compliance with a statute is admissible, although such evidence usually does not have much weight, because statutes only prescribe minimum standards (often reasonable to exercise more care than minimum standard, e.g., drive slower in the snow).

- Law and economics explanation: Cost of precaution to follow statute in given situation is zero since [always]{.underline} supposed to follow statute, so should always at least take that much precaution, but often there are times where there are other precautions which have a cost/burden less than probable damage from accident (so it would be negligent not to take such precautions).

- Related to judge vs. jury argument

- Who decides?

  - Decide before

    - Statutes (legislature)

    - Regulations (agencies)

    - Precedent (judges)

  - Decide after

    - Judges (in a given case)

    - Juries (in a given case)

**CAUSATION**

**Cause in Fact**

- "But for" or *sina qua non* test: requires a determination whether if breach of duty had not occurred, then injury would not have occurred (if yes, then cause in fact).

  - Means that breach of duty must have been necessary for the injury to have occurred, but does not require that it be sufficient by itself.

  - "But for" the breach of duty, the plaintiff would have suffered injury or damage (if no, then cause in fact)

<!-- -->

- [Stubbs v. City of Rochester]{.underline} (Stubbs got typhoid after drinking sewer water due to negligence of the City)

  - Don't have to rule out all alternatives ("differential etiology"), though ruling some out still helpful.

  - Instead, plaintiff must establish with **reasonable certainty** that the direct cause of the injury is one for which the defendant is liable.

    - Possible tools include: changes/timing, experts, statistical evidence, exposure, etc.

- [Zuchowitz v. United States]{.underline} (Zuchowitz got a rare and fatal disease after taking too much Danocrine due to the negligent instructions of naval hospital's doctors)

  - **If (1) a negligent act was deemed wrongful because that act increased the chances that a particular type of accident would occur, and (2) a mishap of that very sort did happen, this allows a trier of fact to find that the negligent behavior caused the harm.**

    - If plaintiff shows this, she satisfies her burden, and burden of proof shifts to defendant.

    - **Rationale:** Defendant likely has more access to relevant information regarding the case, but less incentive to reveal it (shifting burden gives him this incentive).

**Loss of Chance**

- [Matsuyama v. Birnbaum]{.underline} (Due to Birnbaum's negligence, Matsuyama's cancer was not discovered when he still would have had a chance for survival).

  - Loss of Chance Doctrine: A physician may be liable for damages when his negligence diminishes or destroys a patient's likelihood of achieving a more favorable medical outcome (injury = loss of chance).

  - Damages for loss of chance calculated based on proportional damages approach (proportional to full value of damages for death).

  - Loss of chance doctrine has so far been largely limited to medical malpractice cases (though Huang says you can imagine a lot of other possibilities).

    - Reliable expert/statistical evidence more likely

    - Common/widespread issue in medical cases

    - In the absence of the doctrine, the party who is the least capable of preventing the harm is forced to bear the consequences of the more competent party's negligence.

  - \*Court does not decide whether a plaintiff may recover on a loss of chance theory when the ultimate harm (e.g. death) has not yet come to pass.

    - If not including people who didn't die, gets incentives wrong for negligent actor (not enough internalization) 🡪 Even if you were allow plaintiffs to collect for loss of chance when they didn't die, many likely would not since they wouldn't even know they had experienced a loss of chance.

  - Huang: Everyone's actual chance of survival is ultimately zero. Court is really just correcting what the actual harm we are talking about is.

**Future Harm**

- Proportional liability often used due to statute of limitations and res judicata (though some states are beginning to lift these restrictions in certain cases).

  - Arguments against:

    - Plaintiff might not get the second disease and will receive money for nonexistent damages.

    - May deplete the defendant's coffers in the mass tort context so that there will be no money left for those who ultimately do get the disease.

    - Concern about giving a large sum to someone who does not yet need it---and who may spend it now and not have it when the disease does strike.

  - Arguments in favor:

    - Difficulty of proof if one must wait 20 or more years to sue.

    - Deterrent aspect is diminished.

- [Dillon v. Evanston Hospital]{.underline} (Piece of a catheter left in Dillon's body. 0-20% chance of adverse future consequences)

  - Court permitted plaintiff to recover for an increased risk of future injures even if not reasonably certain to occur, but the compensation should reflect the low probability.

- What about pure risk cases? Cases without legally compensable harm?

  - Probably not? Paz v. Brush Engineered Materials, Inc. (Miners beryllium lungs case) and asbestos cases.

**Alternative Liability**

- [Summers v. Tice]{.underline} (Summers was injured after ∆s simultaneously both negligently shot in his direction.)

  - Alternative Liability: If **negligent** defendants brought about a situation in which the negligence of one of them caused the injury to the plaintiff, the **burden of proof shifts** to the plaintiffs to absolve themselves.

  - **Rationale:** Defendants generally have better **access to information**, but less incentive to access/reveal it. Shifting burden gives them this incentive.

    - When there are few possible wrongdoers, there is a relatively high chance that anyone of them caused the injury (**less applicable if many**).

  - Questions unanswered: what if it is unclear whose negligence caused the injury but negligent acts weren't simultaneous but rather virtually simultaneous or not simultaneous at all? (pg. 370 #7,8)

  - What if source of one of the other causes is non-tortious?

    - In Rowe v. Munye, the court said burden shifting inapplicable (pg. 371 #9).

[Dillon v. Twin State Gas & Electric Co.]{.underline} (Boy slips and is going to fall off bridge to death, grabs negligently exposed wire and is electrocuted to death)

- Defendant's liability drastically reduced if injury that was caused by negligence was going to happen anyways (in the future).

**Market Share Liability**

- [Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly & Co.]{.underline} (Plaintiffs injured by drug (DES) mothers took made by many manufacturers)

  - Where **identification** of the manufacturer of a drug that injures a plaintiff is **impossible**, NY courts will apply a market share theory using the **national market**, to determine liability and apportionment of damages.

    - While we can't prove **but for causation** for particular harm, we can prove causation for **harm in general**.

    - Because liability is based on overall risk produced, and not causation in a single case, a defendant cannot exculpate itself by proving that it did not cause a particular plaintiff's injury.

      - [Huang: Does this apply to plaintiffs as well? (137-140 in Abraham)]{.mark}

    - **Not alternative liability / burden shifting**: Lots of defendants who are not necessarily in a better position to provide evidence.

  - **Requirements:**

    - \(1\) Unable to identify manufactures

    - \(2\) **Fungible** (identical products)

    - \(3\) **Clear causal relationship** between the product and the harm (signature disease)

    - \(4\) **Reliable market share data** (**"relevant" market**) 🡪 What a "relevant" market is still disputed by scholars.

  - Dissent ([Relative Market Share Approach]{.underline}):

    - Burden of proof should just shift (defendants should still be able to exculpate themselves)

    - Defendants unable to exculpate themselves should be joint and severally liable

    - Disadvantages: Imposing excessive liability on manufacturer (particularly if many of the manufactures are no long around), fairness concerns, overdeterrance, etc.

    - Partial solution (actually part of the theory): require that a substantial part of the market be joined as defendants.

**Moral Luck:** Even though you may have been exactly as negligent as other persons, you may get off without liability if their negligence causes harm while yours does not (Are we ok with this?)

- Reasons Alright:

  - Individuals should be free to take risks without paying for it if they don't hurt anyone else (Is putting others at risk really injuring them?)

  - If paid everyone for risk, those who were actually injured would be underpaid (unless maybe if they saved all payments from risks in which they were not injured but this is unlikely).

  - As a **practical matter**, too hard to measure risk normally until injury realized

  - **Deterrence:** Don't have to punish morally lucky people to get incentives right (can just punish people who actually cause injury). Best way for potential injurers to be able to anticipate liability is to link it to causation (risk-as-wrongs approach too amorphous).

<!-- -->

- Reasons Against: Maybe putting others at risk is a wrong in itself.

**M.S.C.**

- ***Restatement Third § 27**. Multiple Sufficient Causes*

  - If multiple acts occur, each of which under § 26 (factual cause) alone would have been a factual cause of the physical harm at the same time in the absence of the other act(s), each act is regarded as a factual cause of the harm.

  - *Comment d. One cause tortious, the other innocent.*

    - This section applies in a case of multiple sufficient causes, regardless of whether the competing cause involves tortious conduct or consists only of innocent conduct\... Conduct is a factual cause of harm regardless of whether it is tortious or innocent and regardless of any other cause with which it concurs to produce overdetermined harm\...

- *Restatement Second* (old school): Used substantial factor test.

- **Two Simultaneous Causes: Both Negligent**

  - Courts universally hold that neither defendant can escape liability.

  - Choice is between over-imposition of liability (since harm will occur anyway even when one of the defendants is careful), and under-imposition of liability. The law chooses threatening "too much" liability rather than too little.

- **Two Simultaneous Causes: One Negligent, One Not**

  - Imposing liability on the negligent party will give such parties the incentive to take precautions against harms that will occasionally occur anyway because of a simultaneous non-negligent cause.

  - Also, here plaintiff has much less basis for objecting to denying his recovery, because injury would have occurred regardless of negligence.

  - Many courts do not hold the negligent defendant liable in this situation, but some courts do. It is essential to the courts that do impose liability in such cases that the negligent cause arrived no later than the non-negligent cause (see below).

- **Sequential Causes: Pre-emptive Causation**

  - First cause was the actual physical cause ("pre-emptive" cause). Therefore, party responsible for first cause is liable for injury while party for second "cause" is not.

  - Not entirely consistent with analogous rules (Abraham pg. 128)

    - Hypo 1: Negligently crash into car injuring plaintiff's leg, but cause plaintiff to miss plane which crashes (plaintiff would have died). 🡪 Still liable for broken leg.

    - Hypo 2: Negligently crash into car injuring plaintiff's leg, but plaintiff has terminal cancer and will soon die. 🡪 Damages will take into account the fact that only had a couple months to live.

    - Possible distinctions (though not clear why any of them should make a difference):

      - Hypo 1 treated under the law of causation, hypo 2 under law of damages.

      - Hypo 1 deals with outside forces not yet materialized, hypo 2 deals with internal forces that had already materialized.

**Proximate Cause** ("scope of liability" / "legal cause")

- Claim that negligence was not the proximate cause of injury is based on the fact that something quite unexpected has contributed either o the occurrence of the harm or its severity.

- Has little to do with proximity of time or geography, or with factual cause.

- **Harm-Within-The-Risk Test** (modern view -- restatement): Scope of liability is injuries suffered that are within the risks that makes the defendant negligent in the first place.

  - Things get difficult when injury was not part of the principal risk, but was perhaps a foreseeable (one may say secondary) and relevant risk (foreseeable ≠ imaginable).

- **Foreseeability Test** (old school) (foreseeable ≠ imaginable)

  - To discuss in terms of modern view, discuss in terms of whether a reasonable person would have foreseen and how this would affect reasonable person's determination of whether or not to take precaution.

  - [Unforeseeable Plaintiffs]{.underline} (never liable -- *Palsgraf*)

  - [Unforeseeable Extent of Harm]{.underline} (liable in most cases)

    - [Thin-Skull Rule]{.underline}: It is no defense that plaintiff had a "unforeseeable" weakness of infirmity that caused his/her injury, or much greater severity of injury.

      - Rejection of rule would create practical problems of adjudication

      - Rule imposes a desirable kind of strict liability.

      - Strong argument that Think-Skull plaintiffs should are foreseeable anyways.

    - Exceptions:

      - When it would make more sense for the plaintiff to bear cost of injury than for defendant to be held strictly liable for it

        - If plaintiff was negligent

        - Plaintiff failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate extent of loss due to injury

  - [Unforeseeable Type of Harm]{.underline} (Not liable, though many courts resistant to this and take into account other factors on a case by case basis)

    - *Polemis Case* (Negligence caused board to fall which caused spark which lit petrol, burning ship down)

      - Defendant's negligence is proximate cause of even unforeseeable type of harm, so long as the harm was a "direct" consequence of the defendant's negligence (overruled).

    - *The Wagon Mound* (∆ negligently discharged oil from ship, and two days later oil lit when molten metal from welding landed on cotton waste floating in bay, burning plaintiff's wharf)

      - No liability when a foreseeable plaintiff suffers an unforeseeable type of harm (even if the harm is a direct consequence of such negligence).

    - \^ This rule is broader than most courts accept. Most will make proximate cause decision on a case by case basis, taking into account factors including:

      - Directness of harm

      - Degree which harm resembles unforeseeable type vs. unforeseeable extent

      - Whether defendant's negligence caused other damage for which he will be held liable so that he won't be totally exonerated.

  - [Unforeseeable Manner (Mechanism) of Harm]{.underline} (Still liable if in roughly same time and place and through same general forces as was foreseeable)

    - E.g., Defendant's negligent driving forces plaintiff off the road, who is soon after hit by a third vehicle while trying to warn oncoming traffic.

- Restatement is trying to get as far away from discussion of unforeseeable categories as possible. Extent is the only one so entrenched that it hasn't really been able to get rid of it. However, these arguments are still relevant because courts are used to such arguments and such arguments still affect analysis of negligence (strict categories just aren't as important anymore).

  - Restatement softens traditional harsh categories.

  - [HW: Go through the illustrations in the restatement.]{.mark}

**Superseding Causes:** Where some other cause makes the harm to plaintiff not be a harm-within-the-risk of defendant's negligence.

- A purported superseding cause has no independent significance; however, may make harm being within the risk much less likely, since the intervening factor/cause would have to have been one of the risks taken into account in deciding whether the defendant's actions were negligent.

**Joint and Severally Liable**

- Plaintiff is entitled to recover the full amount of his damages from either defendant.

- **Rights of contribution:** Right to be reimbursed by another defendant for a share of the amount paid to the plaintiff (traditionally such rights operated on a straight fractional-share basis).

- Why not simply hold each defendant liable to the plaintiff for its share in the first instance?

  - Places risk of one of the defendants being insolvent on the plaintiff (preferable to make defendants bear the risk).

- Imposed in **three main situations**:

  - \(1\) [Joint tortfeasors]{.underline}: If two people engage in a joint enterprise (e.g., business partnership).

  - \(2\) [Single, theoretically indivisible harm]{.underline} (by independent tortfeasors) (**MNC?**): If neither of two tortfeasors' negligence is sufficient but both are the necessary causes, and no way to pinpoint the extent of either defendant's causal responsibility (e.g., two negligent drivers crash into each other, killing pedestrian)

  - \(3\) [Single, theoretically divisible but practically indivisible harm]{.underline} (by independent tortfeasors): Each defendant is entitled to try to prove how much harm it caused, but if neither can, defendants will be held joint and severally liable (e.g., one defendant crashes into plaintiff, then another does, second defendant can try to prove to what extent the plaintiff was already injured, but if he can't he will be held joint and severally liable).

- In a way, all modern manipulations of joint and several liability are about who bears the risk that someone isn't going to be able to pay their share (only deal with this question if you are using contributory negligence scheme).

  - Several: Plaintiff bears the risk

  - Joint and Several: Defendants bear the risk

  - Reallocation: ALL bear the risk (including plaintiff)

**Contributory Negligence**

- Contributory Negligence

  - Pros: Administrative Ease (but juries were historically doing comparative negligence anyways by ignoring contributory negligence rule and simply reducing damages (could be seen as a pro-softening tool, or all the more reason to change it)

  - Cons: Gets incentives wrong, Unjust

- Other Softening Tools for Contributory Negligence

  - [Safety statutes]{.underline}: In some situations where a statute is understood to be an effort to protect some group against its own inability to protect itself the statue me be interpreted as barring a defense of contributory negligence. However, relatively few statutes have been given such effect.

  - [Last clear chance]{.underline}: Contributory negligence was also disregarded under circumstances of "last clear chance." Generally, the doctrine was regarded as having a chronological aspect.

  - Greater degree of blame exception (but Huang says this makes no sense)

  - [Willful, wanton]{.underline} (intent): Virtually all courts have decided that contributory negligence was a defense only in cases of negligence, and not in cases where the misconduct of the defendant was more serious---recklessness or willful misconduct.

  - [Avoidable consequences]{.underline}

  - [The Jury's Role]{.underline}: The most modern technique for ameliorating the perceived harshness of the all-or-nothing contributory negligence rule (proper to the adoption of comparative negligence) was the increased frequency with which courts found that reasonable persons could differ over the characterization of the plaintiff's conduct---so that the jury question was presented. Observers asserted that most juries rejected the judge's instruction to return a defense verdict if they found any contributory negligence, even the most minimal contributory fault, so long as it proximately related to the harm (deducted small amount from award instead).

**Comparative Negligence:** A negligent plaintiff's recovery depends on how serious plaintiff's negligence was compared to the defendant's.

- ["Pure" Comparative Negligence]{.underline}: Damages directly proportional to fault (the degree which the cause of the injury can be attributed to parties' negligence)

  - Negatives

    - Moral: Not morally right to permit one more at fault in an accident to recover from one less at fault.

    - Efficiency: Probability of increased insurance, administrative, and judicial costs (but this has been seriously questioned)

- ["Modified" System]{.underline}: Two versions.

  - \(1\) A plaintiff who is at fault can recover as under the pure system but only so long as that negligence is "not as great as" the defendants (can't be equal).

  - \(2\) A plaintiff can recover as under the pure system but only so long as that negligence is "no greater than" the defendant's (can be equal).

  - Negatives (of modified system as a whole)

    - Moral: Modified system simply shifts the lottery aspect of the contributory negligence rule to a different ground (slight difference in the proportionate fault may permit a recovery).

    - Efficiency: Modified system could actually lead to more administrative costs, because of increased number of appeals due to plaintiffs challenging the crucial issue of whether their negligence was equal to the defendants.

Should jurors be told the consequences of their verdict?

- States disagree

- Most jurisdiction that have addressed the issue in recent time have moved away from the rule against informing the jury of the legal effect of its answers, reasoning that the jury will speculate about their decisions legal effect anyways, often incorrectly.

Damage Caps

- Many states, as an aspect of tort reform, have enacted limitations on the total amount of damages that a plaintiff may recover.

- Often these limits are imposed only on non-economic damages such as pain and suffering, but occasionally on the plaintiff's entire damages.

**Changes wrought by comparative negligence**

- [Last clear chance]{.underline}: Defense eliminated.

- [Res ipsa loquitur]{.underline}: Generally held that can only be used to infer negligence of defendant. Jury then compares any evidence of negligence of the plaintiff with the inferred negligence of the defendant in order to decide what percentage of negligence is attributable to each party.

- [Proximate Cause]{.underline}: Because of adoption of comparative damages, innocent and negligent superseding causes should have no independent significance.

- [Rescue]{.underline}: Used to not be barred from recovery for contributory negligence unless rash or reckless, but now most courts have held that they no longer need special protection (some courts disagree). However, social value and altruistic motivation of rescuer can still be taken into account \[Restatement (Third) § 32\].

- [The drinking plaintiff]{.underline}: Now may still be able to recover some damages from person who supplied him the alcohol or person who gave him keys when it was known he was too intoxicated.

**Avoidable Consequences**

- Plaintiff has duty to mitigate harm done.

- Doctrine of avoidable consequences addresses the measure of damages, NOT issues of liability.

- Don't have to mitigate if doing so posses a *recognized risk* to you.

- Reluctance to mitigate by treatment raises special problems when the reasons are based on [religious beliefs]{.underline}

  - Could argue ∆ should be liable because analogous to egg-shell plaintiff rule

  - Could argue ∆ shouldn't be liable because ∆ has no duty to subsidize P's choice to sacrifice her welfare in the name of religion.

- Issue of "anticipatory avoidable consequences" (e.g., failure to wear a seat belt)

- Issue of synergistic interactions

- \*Seems like mitigation (avoidable consequences) is completely distinct from comparative negligence.

[Yellow Cab Case]{.underline}

- Reasons to let Legislature change system to comparative negligence

  - Developing system of comparative negligence piece meal likely will result in incongruity in lower courts at first

  - Legislature may have better ability to consider policy implications (run studies, etc.)

**Assumption of Risk**

- Express (almost always enforced)

- Implied

  - Primary ("inherent")

    - The defendant was not negligent in the first place.

    - Doesn't really have to do with assent, since even a baby in a ball park couldn't sue.

  - Secondary (defendant was negligent)

    - If you unreasonably put yourself in harm's way (subjecting self to defendant's negligence), you shouldn't have a cause of action (contributory negligence).

- In implementing comparative negligence, state are all over the place with regard to assumption of risk (some keep, some trash, some mix, etc.) 🡪 though most have actually wiped out concept of assumption of risk.

  - In theory, assumption of risk may be subjective (getting into P's mind/intent) but can easily argue across the divide (objective because judging P based off reasonable person standard).

  - AoR is traditionally all or nothing while comparative negligence is percentage based.

  - AoR is more rule flavored while comparative negligence is standard flavored.

- [The Flopper Case]{.underline} (Murphy was injured when defendant's ride, the "flopper," caused him to flop)

  - One who takes part in a sport accepts the dangers that are inherent in it so far as they are obvious and necessary.

- [Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation]{.underline} (Davenport told defendant that 1 of 3 stairs to his apartment had a broken light, but continued to use that stairway and was injured as a result)

  - Plaintiff's conduct in assuming a risk can be compared with defendant's negligence and thus made part of comparative negligence system (not as an absolute defense).

**No Duty**

- [Strauss v. Belle Realty Co.]{.underline} (Strauss was old man who was hurt when he had to get water from the common room basement of his apartment building in the dark because of the gross negligence of electric company and defective basement stairs)

  - This case is about policy-based "no duty"

  - Courts generally don't want to just get rid of liability, just want to limit it, so going to try to find a limiting principle.

  - Court uses privity as the limiting principle (no privity 🡪 no duty).

  - Best strategy for plaintiff is to try to show that he is part of a small/distinct class so liability can be granted to him with out extending liability to unmanageable levels, but this strategy isn't really possible here.

  - Service is almost quasi-public, since Con-Edison is only electric company. If they go down, people won't have electricity. 🡪 Connection to big to fail.

  - \*Huang points out that Con-Edison probably could not buy insurance. If they could have, and you rule that they have no duty/liability, you create perverse incentives for large companies to not have insurance.

- [H.R. Moch v. Rensselaer Water Co.]{.underline} (Plaintiff's warehouse burnt down. ∆ allegedly did not provide enough water to put out flames. ∆'s contract was with the city not the plaintiff)

  - No duty to act if inaction merely fails to confer a benefit rather than directly causing harm.

  - Huang: Book uses this case as an example of judge (Cardozo) trying to explain no duty with common law principles (in contrast with *Strauss* where no duty is explained simply as a policy decision common law courts sometimes have to make).

- **Good Samaritan Statutes:** Laws that provide some form of immunity from civil liability for providing emergency aid (for free) (immunity often differs depending on whether you are a trained medical/emergency personnel). Virtually every state has adopted some form of good samaratin statute.

- Huang: Bright line rule between misfeasance (acting negligently) and non-feasance (failing to act).

  - Standard strategy to try to fold omission into the act (all about whether what happened will be categorized as an act or omission).

  - Interesting hypo: driving non-negligently, not hitting breaks to save person who jumped in front of car.

- **Federal Tort Claims Act:** Federal government waived its general tort immunity. Federal government to be treated like a private person, but shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages.

  - [Discretionary Function Exception:]{.underline} Shall not be liable for government employees exercise/performance or non-exercise/performance of a discretionary function, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.

    - Exception read broadly in *Dalehite v. United States*, where court drew distinction between "planning decisions", which are policy oriented (discretionary), and "operational decisions" which are of a non-discretionary nature.

      - Shut down by *Cope v. Scott*? No, just illuminated in further detail.

    - [Cope v. Scott]{.underline} (Cope hit by car when it slid across slippery windy road that was known to be slippery and had little signage)

      - **Two-Step Test:** to determine whether an action is exempt under discretionary function exemption.

        - \(1\) Does statute/regulation/policy specifically prescribe a course of action (If yes, not a matter of discretion, government liable if did not follow prescribed course of action 🡪 \~ negligent per se)

        - \(2\) If no prescribed course of action, were the challenged discretionary acts grounded ("[fraught with]{.underline}") social, economic, or political [policy]{.underline}? (If yes, gov. not liable, if no, gov. liable for negligence).

      - \(1\) No prescribed course of action (handbook ruled to be merely guidelines).

      - \(2\) Road maintenance considered to be a big enough deal to be policy (maybe would be different if type of road maintenance needed wasn't so expensive/significant). Road signs not policy (maybe would be different if road was purely for pleasure driving).

  - TA: If you see federal government or federal land on the test, Huang is probably wanting you to bring up FTCA.

- [Riss v. New York]{.underline} (Riss repeatedly asked for police protection from bat-shit-crazy ex, but police refused. Ex threw acid on Riss's face)

  - Government can not be held liable for its failure to protect the public generally or to control criminal activity, despite the State's limited waiver of sovereign immunity

    - Court says it is distinguishable when government undertakes responsibilities to particular members of society.

  - At this point we are in a world where much of sovereign immunity is gone, but not yer for police. Court says taking away whole areas of sovereign immunity from the police is something for Legislature to decide (have taken it away in other areas but not here).

  - TA: This case is about municipal liability, not FTCA, but can think of it as dealing with government liability. Can also think about it as dealing with affirmative duty.

- *Cuffy v. City of New York* (squib)

  - The general rule that there is no duty to provide police protection has exception in cases of "[special relationships]{.underline}," the elements of which are:

    - \(1\) The [assumption]{.underline} by the municipality through promise or action, [of an affirmative duty]{.underline} to act on behalf of the party who is injured.

    - \(2\) [Knowledge]{.underline} on the party of the municipality's agents that [inaction could lead to harm]{.underline}.

    - \(3\) Some form of [direct contact]{.underline} between the municipality's agents and the injured party.

    - \(4\) The party's [justifiable reliance]{.underline} on the municipality's undertaking.

**Affirmative and Limited Duties** (Abraham)

- Duty is a question of law.

- **Affirmative Duties:** Involves cases in which the defendant's conduct does not negligently *create a risk* of physical harm to the plaintiff, so the defendant has not breached any duty in this respect (not guilty of "misfeasance"), but the plaintiff is independently at risk of suffering physical harm and the defendant might, through the exercise of reasonable care, *eliminate* or *reduce this risk* of harm to the plaintiff (the question is whether the defendant is liable for "nonfeasance").

  - Default rule is that are no such affirmative duties, but there are exceptions to this rule.

- **Limited Duties:** Involves cases in which the defendant's conduct foreseeably creates an unreasonable risk of harming the plaintiff (the defendant has committed misfeasance rather than mere nonfeasance), but the law places limits on the duty to exercise reasonable care not to risk such harm.

- There is no formula for predicting when there is an affirmative duty or when there is a limited duty, but the courts generally take into account the following factors: (TA: when considering ways of drawing duty line should use a balance test considering these factors)

  - The [foreseeability]{.underline} of harm

  - The [closeness]{.underline} of the connection between the defendant's conduct and the harm suffered by the plaintiff

  - The [moral blame]{.underline} attached the defendant's conduct

  - The [extent of the burden on the defendant and the consequences for the community]{.underline} if a duty is imposed

  - The policy of [preventing future harm]{.underline}

  - The [availability]{.underline} and the prevalence [of insurance]{.underline} that is or would be available if a duty is imposed.

**Affirmative Duty**

- [Harper v. Herman]{.underline} (Harper dove off boat unto shallow water 100+ yards from shore, paralyzing himself. Herman (∆) the boat owner, knew the water was shallow there but did not warn Herman)

  - Affirmative duty to act only arises when a special relationship exists between the parties.

  - Generally, a special relationship giving rise to a duty to warn is found only on the part of: common carriers, innkeepers, possessors of land who hold it open to the public, and persons who have custody of another person under circumstances in which that other person is deprived of normal opportunities of self-protection.

- **Act/Omission: 3 Familiar Moves** (from Huang)

  - \(1\) "Actively" omit (omission can be described as an act, e.g., getting out of the way of stroller so it goes off cliff).

  - \(2\) Earlier act created the risk

  - \(3\) Earlier act created reliance (discouraged aid/self-help) (little bit weaker than #2)

    - Special relationships could fit into this category.

  - \*Seems like everything is about trying to prove defendant created the risk rather than failed to decrease it (self).

- [Tarasoff v. Regents of the Univ. of CA]{.underline} (Patient confided his intention to kill Tarasoff's daughter to therapist who told police. Patient detained but then let go. Killed daughter, who was never warned.)

  - Once a therapist determines, or under applicable professional standards reasonably should have determined, that a patient poses a serious threat of violence to others, he bears a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect the foreseeable victim(s) of that danger.

    - CA later made law restricting it to [actual]{.underline} serious [threats]{.underline} of "[reasonably identifiable]{.underline}" victims (no longer just "foreseeable victims") 🡪 little benefit of warning about threats to non-identifiable victims. Also, eases burden on legal system.

    - Could be broadened to more than just person threat was directed at (if reasonably identifiable).

  - Huang: This is the most aggressive affirmative duty that exists, since patient-therapist relationship is the "special relationship"

    - Court says that such a relationship can support affirmative duties for the benfit of third persons (not really clear why)

      - 🡪 Could try to work it in that society is relying on therapist to warn? 🡪 seems weak since you could use this tactic for lots of omissions (self)

  - There is a lot of differing opinions on the breadth that Tarasoff should be given. Main thing to understand is that it is a trade off between maintaining Dr.-patient relationship and possibly preventing future harm, and that courts general are against expansion of Tarasoff.

  - Doe a doctor have a duty to notify sexual partners of patients with aids?

    - Generally no but courts differ.

- Hypos from Notes

  - No duty to rescue, but what if state makes it illegal not to rescue? (note 4, pg. 165)

  - Might a voluntarily adopted safety rule serve as the basis for an affirmative duty? (note 5)

    - 2 cases cited say no

  - Can negligence per se create affirmative duty? (note 6)

    - No, Cuyler v. United States (Posner Opinion)

  - Child abuse reporting statutes (required to report abuse to authorities) (note 7)

    - Posner distinguishes duty to report and duty to rescue (though they both are affirmative duties)

  - Statutes that give duty to report certain crimes (note 8)

**Pure Emotional Harm**

- \*Different then right to recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress and right to recover for emotional distress caused by physical injury ("pain and suffering").

- Two general categories in which liability for "pure" emotional distress might be imposed (Abraham):

  - \(1\) [Independent Duty]{.underline}: Instances in which the failure to exercise reasonable care simply causes another person emotional distress.

    - In general there is no independent duty exercise reasonable care to avoid causing another person emotional distress.

      - Two traditional exceptions are when the ∆ negligently mishandles the corpse of a loved one, and for emotional loss suffered when the ∆ negligently sends a telegram to the plaintiff that incorrectly announces the death of a loved one.

    - Traditional reasons against this no duty-rule are that there is too great of a potential for fraud and that it would open the "floodgates" of litigation, but these are not necessarily persuasive on their own.

    - Another reason is that lifting this no-duty rule would require the development of standards of reasonable care that do not now exist except in a vague way.

    - Probably the most fundamental reason is that remedying NIED in tort suits is just beyond what we want the law to devote its limited energies and resources to (this is not just a "floodgates" argument). 🡪 (Self) Explains rationale behind traditional reasons.

  - \(2\) [Derivative Duty]{.underline}: Instances in which the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing physical injury does not result in physical injury to the plaintiff, but does result in emotional distress, either because the person who physical safety was risked by the ∆ suffers emotional distress, or some third party suffers such distress.

    - Same concerns as above (except for standard of care rule) worry the court, and have motivated the courts to fashion rules that take these concerns into account. Some courts, in addition to these rules, have required physical manifestations of emotional distress.

    - [The Impact Rule]{.underline}: Permits recovery in negligence for pure emotional loss only if the ∆'s conduct resulted in some physical impact on the plaintiff's body, though there is no requirement that the plaintiff by physically injured by the impact (created some very arbitrary results).

      - Over time courts became increasingly dissatisfied with the arbitrariness of the impact rule and replaced it with a zone of danger rule.

    - [The Zone of Danger Rule]{.underline}: The plaintiff could recover for NIED even if there was no impact, if the plaintiff was in the "zone" in which physical injury was threatened, and feared for his or her own safety.

      - Undoubtedly the courts adopting the zone of danger rule recognized that there would be cases in which a plaintiff who was outside the zone of danger nonetheless suffered emotional loss. But denying recover in those admittedly "legitimate" cases as the price these courts were willing to pay I order to avoid the prospect of being forced to adjudicate an unlimited number of potentially plausible claims.

    - [The *Dillon* Rule]{.underline}: Got rid of zone of danger limitation, but still did not employ an "under all the circumstances" test, instead indicated three factors that should be taken into account when deciding whether a claim was one that warranted recovery: (1) proximity, (2) visibility, and (3) relationship. DON'T NEED TO KNOW.

      - It would have been possible for these factors to evolve into mere guidelines surrounding what would amount to an "under all circumstances" test, but this is not what happened. The courts that have adopted the *Dillon* Test, and many have not, preferring to retain the zone of danger approach, have been adamant about drawing bright lines between the kinds of cases that do and do not warrant recovery. Most of these courts have held for instance, that visibility is required and that a close friend or lover is not close enough of a relationship to warrant recovery even when the plaintiff witnesses the injury.

    - [Fear of Future Injury]{.underline}: In a different category of cases, the ∆ has negligently exposed the plaintiff to the risk of suffering future injury. Some courts permit the plaintiff, under limited circumstances, to recover damages resulting from fearing future injury, but in virtually all cases the ∆ would be, or at least could be, held liable for the actual injury that the plaintiff fears will occur in the future, and most cases require some sort of impact (or something impact-like such as an x-ray). But many courts simply do not permit recover for fear of future injury.

- [Falzone v. Busch]{.underline} (∆ (Busch) almost hit Falzone and did hit her husband. As a direct result, Falzone became ill and required medical attention)

  - Tortfeasor should be held liable for [physical manifestations]{.underline} of emotional harm that are the [proximate cause]{.underline} of defendant's negligence.

  - Court says it will be much harder to prove that such harm is the proximate result of injury, but that should not bar plaintiff's ability to attempt to do so.

    - Nor should fear of flood of fraudulent actions.

- [Metro North Commuter railroad Co. v. Buckley]{.underline} (Buckley had no physical manifestations of harm, but filed suit for mental distress due to fear of contracting cancer due to exposure to asbestos. Never went to psychologist.)

  - Physical impact does not encompass all physical contact, **only** **physical contact that threatens immediate harm**.

- *Northfolk & Western Railway v. Ayers* (Workers suffering from asbestosis, a non-malignant respiratory disease asserted claims for emotional distress at the prospect that they might contract cancer in the future)

  - Liability imputed for emotional distress caused by fear of future harm different than physical harm already sustained.

  - Shows rule in Metro North is still rather arbitrary.

**"Pure" Economic Loss**

- Concerns the cases in which physical injury to the person or property of **one party** also results in **purely** economic harm to **another party**. That is, the latter party's losses are not parasitic on any bodily injury or property damage that he suffered.

- Traditional answer ("[economic loss rule]{.underline}") has been to deny such recovery outright.

  - Unlike the law governing recovery for pure emotional loss, however, in this field there has been only very modest evolution away from the bright-line rule denying recovery.

  - Although economic loss is often highly foreseeable, the amount of liability that could result could be enormous and very difficult to predict.

    - This unpredictability would render against the sale of insurance against such liability extremely risky, and therefore likely unavailable.

    - Also, for individuals and small businesses, threatening liability whose potential scope far exceed their assets is pointless.

  - ∆ ordinarily is not immunized from all liability as a result of the rule.

  - Third-party economic losses are normally distributed among large numbers of people. Given such already existing broad loss distribution, the loss-distribution rational for imposing liability on the injurer is weak.

  - A pure economic loss suffered by one party may then result in a pure economic loss suffered by someone with whom he deals, and so on *ad infinitum*. No logical intermediate rule seems available to limit liability. For practical purposes, therefore, the law has chosen to draw the line at no liability rather than to venture into an arena where there would be few if any guidelines for adjudication.

  - Exceptions include some cases involving natural-resource damage for which no party seems to have a cause of action (in such cases, liability for economic loss serves as a kind of substitute for a cause of action for physical damage to natural resources). Importantly, even the cases that have permitted common law recovery tend to share one characteristic: the defendant's negligence is determined by reference to the reasonableness of the defendant's also having risked some other kind of harm---usually physical harm---either the plaintiff or to a third party.

- [532 Madison Avenue Gourmet Foods, Inc. v. Finlandia Center, Inc.]{.underline} (A section of a wall of an office tower collapsed during construction. City had to close street off for weeks.)

  - Liability for economic loss limited to instances of personal injury or property damages.

**Strict Liability**

- [Rylands v. Fletcher]{.underline} (Rylands had dam built on his land that, despite Ryland's reasonable care, broke and caused damages to Feltcher's mine)

  - Both parties are blame free, so who should bear the cost of harm?

  - A person who for his own purpose brings something onto his land likely to do mischief if it escapes, he is prima facie / strictly liable for natural consequences of its escape (natural vs. non-natural distinction).

    - Assumption of risk used as the limiting principle. Fletcher assumed risk of natural flood, but not flood caused by dam (this risk was created by Rylands).

- [Indian Harbor Belt RR Co v. American Cyanamid Co.]{.underline} (Toxic substance spilled out of car loaded by American Cyanamid in RR yard. RR sued American Cyanamid for cost of decontamination.)

  - Strict liability is only imposed when high (improper) degree of risk associated with an [activity]{.underline} cannot be eliminated through due care (Posner focuses on this factor).

  - Abnormal dangerousness is in the contemplation of the law a property of activities not substances.

  - Posner: Strict liability lowers activity levels, while negligence increases care levels, so should only impose strict liability when due care not enough (never explains why negligence is preferable in the first place).

  - Huang: Strict liability puts decision on individuals, while negligence puts it on courts 🡪 proper activity levels.

- [Second Restatement]{.underline}

  - Strict liability for [abnormally dangerous activities]{.underline}. Six factors considered:

    - \(a\) existence of a higher [degree of risk]{.underline} of some harm to the person, land , or chattels of others

    - \(b\) [likelihood]{.underline} that the [harm]{.underline} that [results]{.underline} from it will be great

    - \(c\) [inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care]{.underline}

    - \(d\) extent to which the activity is not a matter of [common usage]{.underline}

    - \(e\) [inappropriateness]{.underline} of the activity to the place where it is carried on

    - \(f\) extent to which its [value to the community]{.underline} is outweighed by its dangerous attributes

  - Pros: Capacity to draw fine distinctions between actives in light of the weight of the six factors.

  - Cons: Pushes decision making (typically by court rather than jury) to a lower level of generality (the great advantage of the earlier ultrahazardous activity approach was not only that it was simple, but also that, for precisely this reason, it encouraged the formulation of strict liability rules at a comparatively high level of generality.

  - Huang: Gets close to doing a negligence analysis for activities.

- [Third Restatement § 20]{.underline}

  - Strict liability is to be imposed if the [activity]{.underline}:

    - \(a\) necessarily involves a [foreseeable]{.underline} and [highly significant risk]{.underline} of physical harm even when reasonable care is exercised by all actors, and

    - \(b\) is [not a matter of common usage.]{.underline}

  - \*Comments to this section suggest that the same factors that were to be considered in Second Restatement still should be taken into account (perhaps with the exception of value to the community)

- **Scope of Liability and Defenses**

  - There is strict liability only for the kind of harm whose risk makes the activity abnormally dangerous---for risks that are "characteristic" of the activity (only strict liability if engaging in the relevant activity is not only the cause in fact, but also the [proximate cause]{.underline} of the harm the plaintiff suffered).

    - Strict liability is not absolute liability for engaging in a particular activity, but only for those consequences that this form of liability is designed to address.

  - Huang: Key move is to expand/contract the scope of activity (just like you expand/restrict scope of harm in proximate cause arugment).

**Trespass:** Entry into the land of another (infringing on owner's right to [exclude]{.underline})

- [Unintended Intrusions:]{.underline} (~~Resulting from reckless or negligent conduct or abnormally dangerous activities~~) Subjected to liability only if the intrusion causes actual harm (Second Restatement § 165)

  - Liability for harm subject to normal doctrinal limitations of negligence and strict liability.

- [Intentional Intrusion:]{.underline} Liable irrespective of harm caused (Second Restatement § 158).

  - [Intent]{.underline} = Intent to enter land, not to harm other's interest in exclusive possession or even intent to invade another's property.

  - Only liable for nominal damages if no harm caused.

- \*In neither case does care/fault matter. Strictly liable if you trespassed?

- [Martin v. Reynolds Metals Co.]{.underline} (Reynolds emitted fluoride particles that poisoned Martin's land, killing his cattle)

  - Trespass is any intrusion that invades the possessor's protected interest in exclusive possession, regardless of visibility of intrusion (**object's energy or force more important than size**).

  - (In this case, statute of limitations would limit recovery of damages if suit brought under nuisance. Martin therefore trying to prove trespass. Normally, suit would just be brought under nuisance because easier to prove).

  - Huang: Martin both soften what counts as entry and in some ways could harden it (may be some cases that previously would have counted as trespass that now would not).

    - Maybe case where trespass wouldn't arouse conflict between plaintiff and defendant 🡪 trespass on unused land of far off owner?

    - What we are protecting is some type of **feeling** of exclusive possession.

      - Huang says you could maybe interpret this to mean that you need to show harm (but that this would be stretching the opinion as far as possible).

      - However, if you don't show harm in trespass you just get nominal damages anyways,

- Hard edges? (things 🡪 rule)... or not? (softening 🡪 *Martin*)

**Conversion:** Willful interference of another's use/possession of chattel (personal possession) without lawful justification.

- Claimant needs to prove

  - \(1\) ownership

  - \(2\) defendant's conversion

  - \(3\) damages

- Doesn't need to prove "intent" 🡪 [similar defense for intent as with nuisance?]{.mark}

- Conversion is more major than "trespass of chattels" 🡪 fully taking away use of chattel

![](media/image2.png){width="7.5in" height="4.9875in"}

**Defenses to Property Torts** (trespass to land, trespass to property, and conversion)

- **Public Necessity:** When there is a risk to the property of a sufficiently large number of people to make the risk "public" and that risk can be reduced or eliminated by damaging or destroying the property of the plaintiff.

  - The privilege is *absolute*. Complete defense to liability---the defendant has the right to make use of the plaintiff's property without incurring liability for damage that results, and the plaintiff does not have the right to prevent him from using his property.

- **Private Necessity:** When there is a risk to one party or his property only, and this party can reduce or eliminate that risk by damaging or destroying someone else's property.

  - The privilege is "*qualified*" or "*conditional*." The defendant is liable to the plaintiff for the damage done to the latter's property. (Privilege of use of property is *conditioned* on later compensation for use.)

- [Ploof v. Putnam]{.underline} (plaintiff tried to tie up at defendant's dock due to storm, but defendant untied the ship, resulting in injury of both the ship and plaintiff's family)

  - Defendant held liable for injuries to ship and plaintiff's family.

  - Privilege of necessity had entitled the plaintiffs to tie up at the defendant's dock. Because doing so did not constitute trespass, the defendant did not have the right to exclude them from the dock.

  - Abraham: Private necessity could be viewed as a limited property interest, and untying ship amounted to trespass on that property interest.

- [Vincent v. Lake Erie Transportation Co.]{.underline} (Lake Erie Trans. (plaintiff) reasonably tied its steamship to Vincent's dock during storm causing damage.)

  - A party acting under private necessity (reasonable belief that use/damage of another's property is necessary to protect some greater interest of the party) is liable for the damages incurred to the property of others.

    - \*Huang: However, necessity is not just about weighing cost to one-side against the other (e.g. walking across someone's property \[causing no harm\] to save yourself 5 minutes). There has to be actual necessity 🡪 emergency, high risk, immediate need, etc.

      - If you have time, you can just contract with dock owner, build your own dock, etc.

- Huang: In personal injury, the victim has the system stacked against him (see grand chart of liability); however, for injury to property, the system is stacked in favor of the victim. [(Doesn't quite make sense, Huang says only time boat allowed to stay is if all three parties think H \> B, but as long both parties allow boat to stay it doesn't matter what court thinks because boat owner is going to have to pay...)]{.mark}

**PRIVATE NUISANCE**

- One is subject to liability for conduct that is a legal cause of an invasion of another's interest in the [private use and enjoyment]{.underline} of land if the invasion is either:

  - \(1\) Intentional + Unreasonable

    - **Intent** = Knowledge that conduct is invading, or is substantially certain to invade another's interest in the use and enjoyment of land

      - Virtually all conduct of a continuing nature is therefore intentional after the initial invasion.

    - **Unreasonable** =

      - \(a\) the **gravity of the harm** outweighs the **utility** **of** the actor's **conduct** (\~negligence)

        - Factors relevant to determining *gravity of harm* (§ 827):

          - [Extent]{.underline} of the harm involved

          - [Character]{.underline} of the harm involved

          - [Social value]{.underline} that the law attaches to the type [of]{.underline} use or [enjoyment invaded]{.underline}

          - [Suitability of]{.underline} the particular use or [enjoyment]{.underline} invaded [to]{.underline} the character of the [locality]{.underline}

          - [Burden]{.underline} on the person harmed of avoiding the harm

        - Factors relevant to determining *utility of the conduct* (§ 828)

          - [Social value]{.underline} that the law attaches to the primary purpose [of]{.underline} the [conduct]{.underline}

          - [Suitability of]{.underline} the [conduct to]{.underline} the character of the [locality]{.underline}

          - [Impracticability of]{.underline} preventing or [avoiding]{.underline} the invasion

        - Abrahams Approach: Balance the equities. Not going to hurt going through the Restatements approach, but in the end you're really just balancing the equities and should focus your analysis on this.

        - Huang: Restatement approach could include fairness factors [(are these specific factors or is he just talking about balancing the equities?)]{.mark} 🡪 Don't think so, basically just saying figure out what makes sense then maybe use the above factors

      - \(b\) the harm caused by the conduct is [serious(/substantial)]{.underline} and the financial burden of compensating for this and similar harm to others would not make the continuation off the conduct not feasible ([defendant can pay \[and keep paying\]]{.underline}) (\~SL)

        - Reasonableness here refers to interference itself, not to the activity of the actor, since if the activity is not reasonable in itself (a) is satisfied.

  - \(2\) Unintentional and arising out of negligent or reckless conduct or abnormally dangerous conditions or activities (in other words, if unintentional you're just dealing with the normal negligence and strict liability doctrines).

**Remedial Alternatives (Private Nuisance)**

- No Nuisance: Defendant "Enjoins" Plaintiff

  - Although such a ruling means that the defendant's activity is not a substantial and unreasonable interference with the plaintiff's use and enjoyment of his land, plaintiff's use and enjoyment almost always interfered with in some way.

  - Thus, the practical significance of the failure of the plaintiff's suit is that the court has enjoined the plaintiff by limiting the scope of his use and enjoyment of his land.

  - Amounts to a property right for defendant, who can choose to sell if he likes.

- Nuisance: Plaintiff Enjoins Defendant

  - Amounts to a property right for the plaintiff (to be free of the alleged nuisance), which the plaintiff can sell to the defendant if he so choses.

- Nuisance: Defendant Compensates Plaintiff

  - Traditional remedy, often given instead of an injunction either because court, having balanced the equities, has decided that the social and economic costs of discontinuing the nuisance are greater than the cost that will result form permitting it to continue, or because the court is uncertain as to the proper solution (has reason to believe parties won't be able to bargain to a solution \[normally the case with nuisance since multiple parties\], so calculates damages, that way activity can continue as long as it can pay for it).

  - [Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.]{.underline} (Neighborhood property owners sued for damages and an injunction against a cement plant they alleged caused nuisance through pollution)

    - Where nuisance is of such a permanent and unabatable nature that a single recovery can be had, there can be only one recovery.

    - Court imposed injunction on ∆ (amounting to entitlement/property rule for plaintiff) protected by a liability rule (∆ can get out of injunction by paying court determined past and future damages).

      - Court is deciding how much nuisance hurts plaintiffs (past and future), and then giving ∆ choice of whether it is worth it to pay.

    - As opposed to just issuing injunction (property right for local landowners) and letting the landowners decide if they want to sell it (price determined by market/through negotiations).

      - Likely due to perceived high bribing/negotiation costs (self).

      - \*Huang: We know from Calabresi that we could just give injunction and let the parties negotiate, but the court is uncomfortable with shutting down the plant. The plant offers too much utility to society.

<!-- -->

- Nuisance: Plaintiff Compensates Defendant

  - Remedy usually only given when the correct solution of the conflict between the parties is uncertain, and an injunction is not a preferable remedy, since there are multiple parties involved and therefore the "wrong" remedy likely won't be able to be bought off.

  - Rarely better to have the plaintiffs decide whether it is worth it to them, but instances of "**coming to the nuisance**" provide an occasional example.

  - [Spur Industries v. Dell E. Webb Development Co.]{.underline} (Developer expanded residential product towards ∆'s cattle feed lot)

    - When plaintiff "**comes to the nuisance**," injunction may be granted contingent on plaintiff indemnifying ∆ for cost of moving/shutting down.

    - Opposite of Boomer: Plaintiff compensating ∆ to get injunction rather than ∆ compensating plaintiff to get out of injunction.

**REMEDIES**

- Right vs. remedy?

- Consistency---why?

- Consistency---how?

- Sources of common law

- Focus on plaintiff or defendant?

- Forward/backward looking?

**Permanent Injunctions**

- [eBay v. MercExchange]{.underline} (MercExchange sought permanent injunction preventing eBay from infringing on its patent)

  - Plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must satisfy a **four factor test** (each factor necessary):

    - \(1\) [Irreparable Injury]{.underline}

    - \(2\) [Remedies]{.underline} available at law [inadequate]{.underline}

    - \(3\) Remedy in equity is warranted in consideration of the [balance of hardships]{.underline} between plaintiff and defendant.

    - \(4\) The [public interest]{.underline} would not be disserved.

  - eBay majority: Always do the equitable analysis (standard) but with four factor framework (\~rule).

  - Chief Justice (+): Property (exclude) = injunction (\~rule)

    - (reverence given to past cases/holdings)

  - AMK (+): Right to exclude ≠ remedy to exclude (change is good/sometimes necessary) e.g. patent "trolls" get leverage

  - Criticism from Columbia Law Review

    - \(1\) + (2) are the same.

    - Fairness factors left out (e.g. unclean hands, estoppel arguments, etc.)

    - Common law history of categorical presumptions for injunctions (e.g. land). Ruling could lead to inconsistency.

      - Majority appealed to history for its opinion but this is BS

  - Things to think about:

    - Framing court's role

    - Push/pull

    - Right vs. remedy

    - Law/equity

    - Rules/standards

    - Who decides... act? price?

- Read a case that showed that maybe all the hype over the four factor test is exaggerated. Court used the same reason (\~property) to get through almost all of the elements of the test.

- Injunctions normally do not come up with accidental torts (mainly just property torts).

**Capping damages -- Pain and Suffering**

- [Seffert v. Los Angeles]{.underline} (Court denied a motion for new trial after jury returned damages award in which damages for pain and suffering far exceeded pecuniary damages)

  - Can only interfere with the amount of damages awarded where it "shocks the conscience" and gives rise to the presumption that it was the result of passion, prejudice, or corruption on the part of the jurors.

  - Huang: We've been talking a lot about shifting/spreading costs; now we are discussing HOW MUCH to shift.

    - It might be possible to think of damages as another way to fine tune the aims of tort laws; however, we're going to see that there are some limits to this use.

- Compensatory damages = "making whole" / "put back in position if not injured"

- Some states have instituted statutory caps for intangible losses, or even caps on total awards in general. Although some courts have upheld these caps against Constitutional challenges, the recent trend has been to strike them down. 🡪 Violate separation of powers clause, possibly 7^th^ Amendment as well (own thought).

**PUNITIVE DAMAGES**

**Dual Purposes of Punitive Damages**

- Deter

  - This plaintiff's harm

  - Other plaintiff's/society's harm

- Punish

  - Defendant's badness with respect to this plaintiff (yes)

  - Defendant's badness with respect to other plaintiffs/society (no 🡪 Phillip Morris)

- Huang: cases always say punitive damages are to deter and punish but in the end seem to always only focus on punishment aspect.

- TA: Sometimes, when compensatory damages are very low, may want to give punitive damages to help deter or incentivize plaintiffs to bring case.

\*It should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages, so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendant's culpability, after having paid compensatory damages, is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.

**Three Guideposts of *Gross* Test** (taken from State Farm v. Campbell)

- \(1\) **Degree of reprehensibility** (most important). Determine by considering whether:

  - the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic

  - the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others

  - the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability

  - the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident

  - the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident

  - **Philip Morris v. Williams** (PM knowingly misled Morris to think smoking was safe, killing him)

    - [Evidence of actual harm to nonparties can be used to determine reprehensibility, BUT punitive damages CANNOT go further and punish a ∆ for harms to nonparties.]{.underline}

    - Punitive damages should only punish the defendant for the conduct that harmed the plaintiff (Rationale: possibility of multiple damages for same conduct, federalism concern for punishment of out of state conduct, due process concern for depriving potential ∆s of fair notice because of arbitrariness as well as right to defend itself).

    - Court must provide assurance that juries are not asking the wrong question (high risk that they will). Cannot authorize procedures that create an unreasonable and unnecessary risk of jury confusing distinction mentioned above.

    - Dissent (Stevens): Punitive damages are a sanction for the public harm the defendant's conduct has caused or threatened. Distinction between taking into account third-party harm for reprehensibility and "directly" punishing for harm isn't real. When a jury increases punitive damages because of injuries to third parties it is by definition punishing the ∆ for third-party harm (this is ok as long as not giving plaintiff compensatory damages of third-parties).

- \(2\) **Disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff** (compensatory damages) **and the punitive damages award**

  - Few awards over a single digit ratio satisfy due process.

  - Greater ratios may comport with due process when a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a [small amount of economic damages]{.underline}.

  - When compensatory awards are substantial, there should be a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages.

  - \*"Wealth of defendant \[i.e. how much pain it will feel from compensatory damages\] cannot justify an otherwise unconstitutional punitive damages award." (State Farm pg. 767).

- \(3\) **Difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the [civil]{.underline} penalties authorized or imposed in in comparable cases**

  - Criminal penalties may be referenced for how serious the State finds the wrongful act, but they have much less use than civil penalties in determining a dollar amount, since criminal penalties can only be imposed after meeting a higher standard of proof (TA didn't talk about this).

**Stategery: Ways to Increase Punitive Damages**

- Joinder, or more extreme, class actions.

**Repetitive Awards**

- In W.R. Grace & Co. v. Waters, a mass tort action involving asbestos products, the court refused to bar multiple awards of punitive damages, though it feared the potential for abuse to the defendant.

  - Broke trial up into two parts, with amount of punitive damages being decided in separate trial (if first trial decided they should be awarded). Cumulative effect of prior punitive damage awards could be offered as evidence in second trial for due process argument.

**Ford Pinto Case**: Cost-benefit analysis, shows paradox of tort law embracing cost-benefit analysis in its negligence standard, even when personal injury and death are at stake, while public attitudes (and the *Grimshaw* court) find it reprehensible.

[Exxon]{.underline} (Exxon Valdez crashed spilling oil. Driven by drunkard.)

- Max multiplier preferred way of reigning in punitive damages (considers and denies using words or capping \$)

[State Farm]{.underline} (State Farm took Campbell's case to trial despite small chance of winning and offer to settle for policy amount)

- "Single digit ratio"

  - This if for judge reviewing jury's award.

  - Think about arguments on both sides for how this comports with dual purposes of punitive damages.

    - Increases legitimacy, consistency, etc.

[Phillip Morris]{.underline} (Cigarettes)

- Evidence of harm to other parties can be used only to determine reprehensibility as it relates to harm to this plaintiff. (punitive damages CANNOT go further and punish a ∆ for harms to nonparties).

**CLASS ACTIONS**

- Why do people want class actions? (advantages)

  - Plaintiffs:

    - \$ too small

    - Pool resources

    - Leverage/bargaining power/press

  - Defendants:

    - Peace/finality

    - Consolidate defense (eliminate cost of duplication)

  - Us

    - Administration/coordination costs

    - Clogging courts

    - Substitute for punitive damages

**CLASS SETTLEMENTS**

- Parties agree on class on their own and then submit class certification and settlement for approval of court at the same time.

- Pros

  - Faster

  - Maybe solves repeat awards for punitive damages issue

- Cons

  - Fairness

  - Did all the people in the class really get their interests represented

  - Maybe judges are more prone to just certify the class if given the bundle.

- \*You can think of areas where these concerns wouldn't apply as much 🡪 e.g. products liablity

- [Amchem]{.underline} (asbestos settlement class action, class not approved)

  - Court ruled that there are still baseline class certification concerns even in settlement class actions

  - Emphasized that you can't ignore Rule 23 class requirements.

  - A lot of people think that Amchem makes it harder to get settlement class actions, but author of article thought it made it easier (though acknowledging that it raised the bar in certain respects)

**Punitive Damage Settlements**

**The "Repeat PD" Problem**

- Whether or not we have a certification problem for PD class / whether PD class can solve repeat PD problem may largely depend on what we think the purpose of PD is.

  - If we think PD are being awarded in individual cases for only badness as it relates to that plaintiff, then maybe we don't' have a problem.

  - If we think individual wards are in part for badness/deterrence to other people, then if those other people bring suit, there may be repeat awards for same badness.

    - How seriously are we going to take Phillip Morris? (self)

    - Also, what about core badness? Is it attributed solely in 1^st^ case, spread all over, etc.

- Also, single-digit ratio

  - Maybe adding up ok because we think its getting worse and worse.

  - Sharkey: thinks you need a lot of people to deter (need at least 10%) and this is ok, other people disagree that Phillip Morris would allow this.

- Seems like a mass tort class action would get rid of repeat PD problem (if it existed at all( as long as class action proper.

  - Not so much if pure PD class action (Simon II)

- Maybe jury thinking about previous judgments could actually backfire resulting in subsequent juries just copying previous PD awards.

Issues

- Societal or individual?

- (conflicting) aims of PD

- (conflicting) aims of tort law

- "contracting around the law"

**Problem with Mass Torts**

- Mass torts present the problem of whether or not the tort system is even the right way to deal with the issue

- Traditional answer: class action

  - Seems good at first (good deterrence, loss spreading, etc.)

  - However, class actions are getting harder and harder to use, specifically in the mass tort context because there is so much variation within the class.

**Multi-District Litigation** (Vioxx, BP)

- Allows you to consolidate cases across districts

  - Consolidate discovery, etc.

- MDL wasn't meant to be a class action substitute at first (just for consolidating discovery) but now two new things:

  - Bellweather trials

  - Settlements

- Issue: In a way seems like just a way to get around class action protections

  - However, bellweather suits not binding (major difference)

    - International benefit?

  - However, Viox: \$5 billion settlement after losing only 1 of 5 bellweather trials.

    - Why?

      - Other parallel litigation people could opt out of settlement and go into. Might not go as well.

      - Litigation costs.

What is the benefit of the tort system, even if maybe having to use creative devices like MDLSs, rather than just going outside of the tort system entirely?

**Class Overview -- Big Concepts**

- Forward looking vs. backward looking (ex ante vs. ex post)

- Rules vs. Standards

  - Consistency vs. fairness (morality requires)

  - Less cost to court system vs. complexity may require

  - Rules:

    - Pros: Admin easy, clear, consistency. If our goal is ex ante certainty then rules are likely the way to go (less suits brought if there is clarity → less burden/cost on court system).

    - Cons: Arbitrary, ignore particular facts, gaming/distortions

  - Standards

    - Pros: Discretion to consider facts, flexible/resilient to changing circumstances in world (e.g. technology). If our goal is to insure ex post fairness, then standards are likely the way to go (though rules will make sure like cases are decided alike).

    - Cons: Discretion to consider facts, costly to courts, lack of competence (specifically with juries), inconsistency.

- Judge vs. Jury (related to rule vs. standard)

  - [Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. v. Goodman]{.underline} (Goodman struck by ∆'s train while crossing tracks. ∆ argued that Goodman's own negligence caused his death)

    - **Holmes:** At a certain point a judge figures out what the standard should be, at which point they have a duty to lay down a standard/guideline once and for all (really a rule) in order to increase consistency.

      - Notion of jury oscillating around an ideal standard.

    - In such circumstances, if a driver cannot be sure otherwise whether a train is dangerously near he must stop and get out of his vehicle (driver must stop for the train, the train doesn't have to stop for him).

      - Great example of a judge making a shitty rule.

  - [Pokara v. Wabash Railway Co.]{.underline} (Similar circumstances to *Goodman* but four tracks in a row)

    - **Cardozo:** Judges do not have the authority or foresight to make hard and fast laws (should leave these types of decisions up to the jury since they can't foresee all future circumstances)

- **Objective/Subjective Standard**: It's a trade off.

  - If you hold everyone to an objective standard, then you no longer would have duty to take into account other people' capacities when making your own decisions. 🡪 No incentive to increase care around people with decreased capacities.

  - However, maybe people with lower capacities should decrease activity levels. Objective standards incentivize this.

- Aims of tort law

  - Compensation

  - Loss-spreading 🡪 wealth redistribution

    - Acts as a type of insurance 🡪 but Posner thinks that it is a shitty form of insurance

  - Deterrence

  - Punishment

- Admin costs

- Who decides

  - Judge/jury

  - Court/legislature

- Types of Arguments (talked about in the beginning of Abraham, good for making arguments on exam)

  - Fairness/ethics/morality

  - Incentive/deterrence

  - Costs/social welfare

  - Admin concerns

- Concept of moral luck (is this something we are okay with or that we want to fix)

- Theories of tort law

  - Coase

  - Calabresi

- Extending vs. applying doctrine

**Abraham -- What is the nature of tort law?**

- Rights based (about redress, or providing recourse for, wrongs) vs. instrumental (prevent wrongs, compensation, etc. 🡪 we should be concerned about the effect that imposing liability will have ex post on others beside the plaintiff and the defendant), or mixed?

- Corrective justice (rights based): Injurer corrects/compensates a particular wrong.

- Civil recourse (rights based): Satisfy victim's need for recognition that they have been wronged.

- Optimal deterrence (instrumental)

- Loss distribution

- Compensation (weak/debateable)

- Redress of social grievances (weak on its own)

**Policy questions**

- Strict liability + contributory negligence?

  - Results in negligence standard for plaintiff

- Strict liability + comparative negligence?

  - Results in strict liability + comparative negligence for plaintiff

    - One way to make it make sense is just to say it's the reverse in that ∆ is strictly liable, but if someone is negligent, then we do NORMAL comparative negligence analysis (if plaintiff was negligent and ∆ was not, no liability).

- Both talked about in Abraham (but says courts don't know). However, maybe not so much of a big deal because already exists in practice just in reverse. Would need to talk about whether reverse would be preferable though (self).

Use of Coase Theorem

- Coase Theorem doesn't care who bears the costs. HUANG CARES ABOUT WHO BEARS THE COST. But, says worth thinking about in what situations we wouldn't care (maybe between two corporations, or two insurance companies (really good at calculating risks).

Hammontree v. Jenner

-  Liability of a driver, suddenly stricken by an illness rendering him unconscious, for injury resulting from an accident occurring during that time rests on principles of negligence.

**REMEDIES**

- Right vs. remedy?

- Consistency---why?

- Consistency---how?

- Sources of common law

- Focus on plaintiff or defendant?

- Forward/backward looking?

**[Moral Luck]{.mark}:** Even though you may have been exactly as negligent as other persons, you may get off without liability if their negligence causes harm while yours does not (Are we ok with this?)

- Reasons Alright:

  - Individuals should be free to take risks without paying for it if they don't hurt anyone else (Is putting others at risk really injuring them?)

  - If paid everyone for risk, those who were actually injured would be underpaid (unless maybe if they saved all payments from risks in which they were not injured but this is unlikely).

  - As a **practical matter**, too hard to measure risk normally until injury realized

  - **Deterrence:** Don't have to punish morally lucky people to get incentives right (can just punish people who actually cause injury). Best way for potential injurers to be able to anticipate liability is to link it to causation (risk-as-wrongs approach too amorphous).

<!-- -->

- Reasons Against: Maybe putting others at risk is a wrong in itself.

**Calabresi Goals**

- Compensation

  - Spreading of injury burden (cost)

  - Wealth (re)distribution (deep pockets)

  - \*Calabresi points out that if this is all we were interested in, we wouldn't have to look at causation.

- Deterrence (goal of minimizing costs of accidents and precautions)

  - "Collective/Special" Deterrence (regulatory)

    - Carving out category of behaviors, so doesn't deal with causation.

  - "Market/General Deterrence (price/tax)

    - This works through causation, since once we know who caused injury we can impose costs upon him.

    - Proximate cause helps select cheapest cost avoiders.

    - Market deterrence may be preferable since prices/technologies fluctuate all the time. Huge information costs to always make new rules for specific situations.

    - We need the law to select the cheapest cost avoider. Bribing costs (transaction/information costs) should be taken into account (reason Coase theorem doesn't work).

**Calabresi on Proximate Cause**

- Goal of spreading damages (both in general and to people with more wealth)

  - Requirement of proximity may at most serve as a limit, a device for selecting the best spreader out of a group of potentially liable actors who were originally identified on the basis of causation principles irrelevant to spreading.

    - E.g. proximate cause's link to foreseeability and link to "size and nature of damages" is closely linked to the ability of the potentially liable party to "self-insure."

- Goal of deterrence

  - The requirement of proximity in causal relationships, unlike that of but for relationships, may help to select from the universe of causally linked action those actions worth deterring collectively, by selecting relatively good avoiders of accident costs.

  - Proximate cause implies some look at the relative susceptibility of various actions to modifications diminishing their riskiness---excludes from liability some relatively less risky actions.

  - The requirement of proximate cause does not mean that only one among many causes must be determined to be proximate, yet the more subtle student also learns that whether a causally linked party is held responsible as a proximate cause depends, in party, on what other parties were involved and how risky their behavior was in comparison to his. One element in the trade-off between safety and injury costs in any particular activity is bound to be whether controlling or modifying another activity would be more efficient.

  - Past foreseeability should not be a prerequisite to liability if the goal is purely market deterrence. A cheapest cost avoider of future costs exists even though no one could have foreseen what was to transpire. Even though past injuries were not foreseeable, placing liability for them on one party rather than another may beneficially affect future choices.

  - Thus, while proximate cause may serve to limit the liability of faulty injurers and leave the losses on non-faulty, perhaps more proximate victims, it cannot serve to do the reverse and burden faultless, but "very proximate" injurers (thus can't do the whole job of market deterrence).

  - The fact that one party cannot foresee a certain kind of damage does not automatically exclude it as a cheapest cost avoider, although the chances that it is are reduced. (Assuming unforeseeable risks may cluster around certain activities). (Can explain whether we assign liability in different foreseeability categories).

    - [Foreseeability of plaintiff]{.underline} -- If defendant is cheapest cost avoider for a set of foreseeable plaintiffs, it doesn't mean that he is also the cheapest cost avoider for an unforeseeable plaintiff.

    - [Foreseeability of extent of damage]{.underline} - By and large, if a defendant category is the cheapest avoider of one type of damage vis-à-vis a given category of plaintiff, then that same defendant will be the cheapest avoider of any related, but unforeseeable or barely foreseeable extra damages to the same category of plaintiff.

      - Subject to some exceptions when plaintiff could avoided injury more cheaply.

    - [Foreseeability of type of damage]{.underline} -- Ability to foresee type of damages lies somewhere in between plaintiff and extent of damages.

**Strict Liability Policy -- Abraham / Posner**

- **Crux of the Issue**

  - In strict liability regime, the parties determine the activity/care level.

    - Under a negligence regime do courts deal with thinking about care AND activity levels (just aren't that good at determining activity levels.

  - Takeaway: Both regimes affect activity and care levels. Brings up issue of who is better at making these decisions?

    - People/company's likely better at making this decision in most circumstances (self)

      - However, in some cases this might not always be the case? 🡪 maybe instances in which custom is negligent (not sure if I buy this).

- **Information/Administration Costs**

  - [Per case administrative costs likely decreased]{.underline}: Strict liability should reduce litigation costs per case since fact intensive findings necessary to resolve issues of negligence no longer relevant.

  - [Number of cases likely increased]{.underline}: All injuries now entering the court system, not just those caused by negligence (however, this might not happen if, due to change in activity levels, less accidents occur overall).

  - [High Level of Generality vs. Low Level of Generality]{.underline}: The per case cost of adjudication under a strict liability standard set at a high level of generality is very likely to be lower than the per cases cost of adjudication under standard set at a low level of generality. A context dependent rule that is formulated at a lower level of generality will result in case-by-case adjudication that is likely to be more expensive and complicated than litigation under a rule operating at a high level of generality. (This distinction is likely to weigh heavily on the net effect of the interaction between per-case and total costs.)

- **Error Costs** (Risk of Error)

  - There is a greater risk of error in making the negligence determination because it is potentially more fact-intensive.

  - Strict liability may be preferable in circumstances in which there is likely to be a high rate of error because hard to get evidence (e.g., transportation of highly flammable material that is likely to destroy evidence of negligence when it explodes).

  - However, the consequences of an error is worse under strict liability, because a mistaken ascription of causation, or an overestimation of damages could fully deter an activity rather than just over incentivize precaution (less likely to fully deter the activity).

- **Influencing Activity Level and Research Decisions**

  - In practice, negligence liability is rarely imposed of for engaging in an excessive level of activity.

  - A shift to strict liability gives parties more reason to consider alternative methods of conducting their activities, by making them internalize non-negligently-caused activities.

    - It may be that a partial rather than a complete substitution of one activity for another is the cost-minimizing approach.

  - Because actors are fully internalizing the cost of their activities (including non-negligent injuries), strict liability may create research incentives.

  - Reasons why strict liability not categorically preferable to negligence:

    - \(1\) There may be activities for which there are no readily available substitutes.

    - \(2\) Changes in activity level by victims are also a method of accident avoidance, and one that is encouraged by negligence liability but discouraged by strict liability. In a sense there is always strict liability, since the operative effect of denial of strict liability recovery by victims is that victims bear the cost of their non-negligently-caused injuries---they are strictly liable for them, to themselves. [Imposing strict liability is thus a policy decision by the courts about which activity-level should bear costs.]{.underline}

      - [Only when a class of activities can be identified in which activity-level changes by potential injurers are the most efficient method of accident prevention is there a compelling argument for imposing strict liability.]{.underline}

- **Promoting Insurance or Broad Distribution of Losses**

  - Strict liability might be imposed because a particular category of injurers, rather than a particular category of victims, is in the best position to insure or otherwise broadly distribute the costs of non-negligently caused accidents.

  - In general, injurers are more likely than victims to be large institutions that can spread the cost of liability directly in their prices or services, or to purchase liability insurance whose cost is included in these prices or services.

  - Even in the domain of loss distribution, however, injurers are not necessarily always superior to victims as loss bearers (i.e. health care insurance, most people have it and soon virtually everyone should have it due to affordable health care act). The choice therefore, is not between broad loss distribution though injurer strict liability or narrow distribution by declining to adopt such strict liability. Rather, the choice is between two different channels of broad distribution.

  - Posner: In this category, using strict liability to insure victims of unavoidable accidents is a gain only if the cost of insurance through the tort system is less than the cost to potential victim of buying accident insurance policies in the insurance market---almost certainly it is not (tort system is a very costly method of providing insurance).

**Enterprise Liability** (fairness) (two propositions at its core) (takes issue with restatement approach, note 2, pg. 534)

- \(1\) Activities should bear their characteristic accident costs.

  - Fault liability pins the costs of the nonnegligent accidents that are the long-run price of an activity's presence in the world on the random victims of the activity.

  - Enterprise liability pins those accident costs on the activity---the enterprise---which imposed the nonnegligent risks responsible for the injuries at issue.

- \(2\) Enterprise liability holds that an enterprise's accident costs should be distributed among the members of the enterprise.

  - The costs of an injury should be shared by those who profit from the activity responsible for the injury; they should not be concentrated on the injured party, or be dispersed across unrelated activities (self: both buyer and seller of product are beneficiaries)

- These two propositions are often linked to a particular conception of fairness that requires a just distribution of burdens and benefits. It therefore gives rise to a presumption that [the costs of the accidental physical injuries characteristic of an activity should be borne by those who benefit from the activity, whether or not they are culpably responsible for precipitating the injuries at issue]{.underline} (self: argument against social insurance /government picking up the tab).
