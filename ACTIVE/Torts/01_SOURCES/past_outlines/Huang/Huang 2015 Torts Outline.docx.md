A **tort** is an injury for which the law provides a remedy; a civil wrong not arising out of contract.

- Two types of torts: unintentional (negligent and strict liability tort) and intentional tort.

- Note to self: Pros/cons/problems/**possible improvements** for doctrine

**EXAM TIPS**

- [Start with presumption that we're talking about negligence, only if things are strange, random person who wonders into fact patter -- then talk about affirmative, danger (real) then maybe SL, or if there is an omission of act. Otherwise presume duty!]{.mark}

- **[For each negligent act, you must satisfy all of these elements!!]{.mark}**

- Organize exam by claim (then walk through all four elements)

- Use headers for both fact patter and policy question!

# 

# ELEMENTS OF A TORT

- For each negligent act, you must satisfy all of these elements.

1.  **DUTY** (legal duty to comply with a particular standard of care)

    a.  **Duty of reasonable care when you act** (you *[always]{.underline}* have this whenever you take any action)

        i.  Action is broad. You built house & didn't do anything for 20 years, but still you built it. Don't waste time & word limit on this.

        ii. For this reason, duty is usually not an issue

    b.  **Duty of reasonable care when you initiate no action**

        i.  Affirmative duty (active omission, creating reliance, imposing risks)

        ii. Duty to warn (in special circumstances, products liability, medical malpractice)

        iii. Special relationships (*Tarasoff*)

        iv. Statute can create a tort duty

    c.  **Strict liability**

        i.  R3rd (1) foreseeable and highly significant risk even when reasonable care is exercised, and (2) not of common usage.

        ii. Take list of factors from R2nd

    d.  **Policy**: Negligence v. Strict Liability (levels of care v. levels of activity)

2.  **BREACH OF DUTY** (failure to comply with the applicable standard of care)

    a.  Negligence: failure to take care that a reasonable person would under the circumstances.

        i.  Standard: BPL

        ii. Method: Always start with identifying the negligent action (this becomes you "burden" in BPL)

        iii. Question: Objective v. Subjective

        iv. Shortcuts:

            1.  Negligence per se (statues)

            2.  Customs

            3.  Medical standards (mandatory, and create safe harbor if you meet)

3.  **CAUSATION**

    a.  Factual Causation

        i.  But for causation

        ii. Multiple sufficient causes

        iii. Multiple necessary causes

        iv. "Joint" tortfeasors (jointly -- all agree to do a tort -- conduct OR indivisible harm)

        v.  Proof problems

            1.  Preponderance of the evidence standard

            2.  Alternative liability (*Summers v. Tice*)

                a.  Shifts burden on the DF to prove themselves out of liability

            3.  Market share liability

        vi. Harm: lost chance (harm is redefined as lost chance of survival rather than death) -- gets around "but for" caustion, but scope is limited.

        vii. Allocation of damages

             1.  Joint and several

             2.  Several

    b.  Legal Causation/Proximate Cause

        i.  Scope of the risk: harm within the risk

        ii. Pertinent Considerations

            1.  Type of Harm (usually breaks chain of causation)

            2.  Manner of Harm (usually does not break chain of causation)

            3.  Unforeseeable PL (Yes, see *[Plasgraf]{.underline}*)

            4.  Extent of Harm (No)

            5.  Intervening Cause (Maybe) -- see how big the cause is

                a.  E.g. you cause accident, then person goes to hospital where doctor operates and injury gets worse -- is the doc crazy or just plain old negligent?

        iii. Takeaways:

             1.  Make relevant arguments; these concepts are not set in stone.

             2.  Weird facts 🡺 Discuss proximate cause

4.  **PROPERTY TORTS** (other causes of action, new regime -- negligence isn't working, so try trespass or conversion or **nuisance (foil for negligence)**

    a.  Trespass

        i.  Intent

        ii. Entry on another person's land

        iii. Necessity exception: reasonableness standard

    b.  Nuisance

        i.  Unreasonable and substantial interference with a person's use and enjoyment of their real property

    c.  Conversion (like trespass, but with personal property) \*\*\* THINK ABOUT THIS AS A REPLACEMENT REGIME FOR NEGLIGENCE!

        i.  Ownership

        ii. Wrongful disposition

        iii. Damages

    d.  Trespass to chattels (like nuisance, but with personal property)\*\*\*THINK ABOUT THIS AS A REPLACEMENT REGIME FOR NEGLIGENCE!

5.  **DAMAGES/INJURY**

    a.  Legal remedies

        i.  Compensatory damages

        ii. Punitive damages (still ongoing)

        iii. Nominal damages

    b.  Equitable remedies

        i.  Permanent injunctions

        ii. TROs/preliminary injunctions

    c.  Statutory remedies

        i.  Full defenses to injury

            1.  "pure" economic harm

            2.  "pure" emotional harm

            3.  *Strauss*: quasi-public organization (liability might have to come under another regime, like under K law)

# THEMES OF TORT LAW

1.  **JUDGE V. JURY** (who is your audience & making the decision)

    a.  Courts v. legislature

    b.  Q: Institutional competencies, trust, information?

*[Hammontree v. Jenner (CA 1971)]{.underline}* -- Jenner has epileptic seizure and runs car into Hammontree's shop, had long history of seizures, but Dr. approved his driver's license.

- Three types of arguments & when they are effective:

  - **Human** (may be more attractive to jury):

    - Who is more blameworthy?

    - Who can pay? Bear the losses with the least trouble?

    - Shared blame or innocent victim?

    - Moral/ethical, fairness

  - **Policy** (good for judge & jury)?

    - equality of treatment

    - equality of outcomes

    - incentive to live up to a standard

    - incentives for the party that knows/can do something about it

    - What is easy, less costly to administer?

    - What activities, precautions do we want to encourage, discourage?

  - **Legalistic** (attractive to judge)

    - what can juries decide well or easily?

    - how verifiable are things?

    - Easy default rule?

    - Follow precedent.

- Battle is fought in **jury instructions** -- here PL's lawyer is pushing for a change in law regarding standard of care from negligence to SL (this needs to be reflected in jury instructions).

2.  **[RULES V. STANDARDS]{.mark}**

    a.  Q: When do you switch regimes?

    b.  Q: How much tailoring do you do? (How do you tailor?)

    c.  **Definitions**

        i.  **Rules** - are the most constraining and rigid. Once a rule has been interpreted and the facts have been found, then the application of the rule to the facts decides the issue to which it is relevant. (Five year children are not negligent)

        ii. **Standards** - provide an intermediate level of constraint. Standards guide decisions but provide a greater range of choice or discretion; standards define a set of mandatory considerations (Learned Hand)

        iii. We see different guidelines set dealing with railroad standards for drivers: Holmes argues that drivers must stop and look (rule). Cardozo argues for a standard (drivers must exercise reasonable caution)

    d.  **Pros and Cons**

        i.  **Rules**

            1.  P: Ex ante predictability and clarity

            2.  P: Effective deterrence

            3.  P: Administration is easy

            4.  C: The cutoffs are arbitrary and harsh (all or nothing)

            5.  C: Ex post not flexible

            6.  C: Hard to carve out exceptions so unfair sometimes

            7.  C: Arbitrary b/c ignores particular facts, susceptible to manipulation

        ii. **Standards**

            1.  P: Ex post fairness

            2.  P: Permits ex post flexibility & allows judicial discretion

            3.  P: Easier to allow flexible exceptions based on circumstances

            4.  C: Unclear from ex ante guidance

            5.  C: Inconsistent results in courts

            6.  C: Lack of competence within the courts and expensive

3.  **[AIMS OF TORT LAW (See Conflicting Aims of Tort Law section)]{.mark}**

    a.  **[Corrective Justice]{.mark}**

    b.  **[Deterrence v. compensation]{.mark}**

    c.  **[Fairness v. blameworthiness]{.mark}**

    d.  **[Risk spreading/ Loss Distribution v. social welfare]{.mark}**

        i.  [Remember for policy qs, especially.]{.mark}

    e.  [Cheapest Cost Avoider (see below)]{.mark}

4.  **[CALEBRESI AIMS OF TORT LAW]{.mark}**

    a.  [Goal of tort law is to find the **[cheapest cost avoider]{.underline}**, make him pay the costs.]{.mark}

        i.  Aim is to [minimize [accident cost]{.underline} (\$\$ accident/PL) + [precaution cost]{.underline} (\$\$ spent/B)]{.mark}

        ii. Seek maximum degree of internalization of externalities

        iii. When unsure, pick party who can enter transactions most cheaply

             1.  Cheapest cost avoider tends to be cheapest transactor -- "best briber"

             2.  Best briber is one who faces the lowest transaction costs, approaches the ideal of the Coase Theorem. Factors:

                 a.  Who knows the risks?

                 b.  Who knows how to reduce the risks?

                 c.  Who knows whether they will be liable?

    b.  ["But for" causation]{.underline} sweeps all candidates in, [proximate cause]{.underline} assigns liability to the CCA **[(CCA 0 -- who can take the cheapest precaution, CCA1 -- best info, CCA 2 -- best bargainer)]{.mark}**

    c.  However, CCA furthers only the utilitarian goals of tort law (minimizing cost). Morality, blameworthiness, social norms, risk spreading are not considered!

        i.  Alternative: Why don't we use more than just the accident costs/damages as incentives? How about we added punitive damages as well (serves other aims like morality, social norms, etc.).

    d.  [**Calebresi** *[Compensation Goals]{.underline}* (backward looking -- ex post)]{.mark}

        i.  Spreading of losses and costs via insurance and mutual insurance to promote societal distribution of losses

        ii. Wealth distribution -- deep pockets:

            1.  Better able to bear the costs (form of thinking about insurance)

            2.  Diminishing marginal utility of money justifies deep pockets

            3.  More power means more power to control things and how things are framed

        iii. We are still uncomfortable with the fact that there is a disconnect with the physical connection; **causation doesn't matter** when we are just concerned with distribution or deep pockets (deep pockets would only require taxation, for example)

        iv. **Fairness/Deterrence:** unfair that the person who is at fault does not have to pay and it does not effectively deter people from avoiding dangerous conduct because the richest people are paying for their faults

    e.  [**Calebresi** *[Deterrence Goals]{.underline}* (forward looking -- ex ante)]{.mark}

        i.  Efficient deterrence: minimize the sum of injury costs and safety (precaution) costs as well

        ii. **Specific deterrence** (regulation): regulations to control behavior

            1.  We do not need to know the exact causation to create regulations

            2.  **Not taking into direct causation as much**

            3.  Not as economically efficient compared to general because it does not account for different situations such as changing technology and circumstances

        iii. **General deterrence** (price/tax): increases the price of certain activities such as carbon tax

             1.  **Works through causation**: A link between behavior and the harm -- we can generate the proper price and tax to achieve the right amount of deterrence.

             2.  **Forseeability matters more for this** because we can measure the right price that leads to the proper amount of deterrence (and not lead to over-deterrence or under-deterrence)

                 a.  You need to foresee the amount of harm in order to impose a proper amount of price or taxation to deter that behavior in an efficient manner

                 b.  Internalize the costs

             3.  Price mechanism makes it more efficient to adopt cheapest choice

                 a.  People can adopt a more efficient (cheaper) choice when there's no regulation

        iv. Controls both [*care levels* and *activity levels*]{.underline} 🡪 if the harm costs \$100 and the business is \$90, then it will shut down. *Care level* affects both the harm causer and the potential victim; *activity level* only controls the harm causer's behavior

        v.  *Radical Symmetry*: the benefit to the society seems to be just as important to the costs of the factories and other polluters

5.  **MORAL LUCK**

6.  **OVERINCLUSIVE V. UNDERINCLUSIVE**

7.  **BURDEN-SHIFTING & INFO-FORCING**

8.  **ROLE OF STATUTES**

    a.  Common law uses statutes to determine breach

    b.  Common law uses statues to determine duty

    c.  Common laws uses statues to determine damages

    d.  Statutes incorporate common law (BP, FTCA)

    e.  Federal statutes can preempt state common law

9.  **[COASE THEORY -- FUNCTION OF LAW]{.mark}**

    a.  [*Coase Theorem*:]{.underline} what is the mechanism of the law in choosing who will bear the burden when the parties can choose who can more efficiently (cheaply) bear the burden?

        i.  Questions the **purpose of the law** - essence is that parties will come together to get to the cheapest way to deal with harm **no matter where you place the liability** so **what is the function of the law?**

# CONFLICTING AIMS OF TORT LAW

## Rights-oriented aims: Corrective Justice & Civil Recourse:

a.  Corrective Justice: Tort law as a way of restoring the moral balance between wrong-doer and victim

b.  Civil Recourse: Tort law is a way of providing victims with recourse for civil wrongs.

c.  **Pro**: Justifies popular sense of moral blame (both), works well for individuals, intentional wrong-doer (corrective justice), vindicates victims' need for recognition that they have been wronged (civil recourse).

d.  **Con**: Less applicable in modern day where DF is often a faceless corporation or individuals covered by liability insurance.

## Optimal Deterrence:

e.  Promote optimal deterrence -- to deter excessively risky activity so that only those losses worth avoiding are avoided. (BPL)

f.  **Pros**: Produces the most economic solution -- just enough deterrence to prevent risks not worth taking, but not too much to require foregoing some of the benefit of that activity.

g.  **Cons**: Only takes into consideration economic values and ignores other important human values; pain & suffering from accident shouldn't be reduced to economic value of what it takes to prevent it.

## Loss Distribution:

h.  Promotes the broad distribution of losses due to accident/injury.

i.  **Pros**: Among all other things equal, having a large number of people bear a small loss is better than having single person bear all of it.

j.  **Cons**: (1) Does not satisfy sense of moral blame (2) Tort law system is an expensive mechanism for distributing losses (insurance, social security are cheaper ways).

## Compensation (LIMITED):

k.  Promote compensation to those who have suffered injury.

l.  **Pros**: Makes people feel more secure that they will be compensated for the harm they suffered.

m.  **Cons**: We need more than injury to justify liability, so there needs to be more than just the goal of compensation.

# BREACH OF DUTY (1 & 2)

Five building blocks of Breach of Duty

1.  Ordinary care under the circumstances

2.  Burden of proof (BOP) on PL

3.  Contributory negligence (takes two to tort)

4.  Foreseeability

5.  Untaken precautions

## NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

### Articulation of the Standard

1.  N.B. Distinguish from tort of negligence (claim for negligence), which has four elements: (1) a duty of reasonable care, (2) breach of that duty, (3) causation, and (4) resulting damages. Here we deal with SECOND element (breach of duty) because to say that DF "was negligent" is to say that he breached the standard of due care.

2.  **Negligence is failure to exercise the care that would have been exercised by the reasonably prudent person under the circumstances.**

    a.  [A]{.smallcaps}n unintentional act can be tortious if it is negligent.

**[Brown v. Kendall (MA 1850)]{.underline}** -- PL and DF owned dogs that were fighting, and in attempting to break up the fight with a stick, the DF accidentally struck the PL in the eye.

- **(Factor 1)** No liability if DF did not intent to injure the PL **or** had negligently injured him & negligence results from *[lack of ordinary care, which varies with the circumstances.]{.underline}*

- **(Factor 2)** *[PL has burden of proving either intent to injure or negligence]{.underline}*; DF need not prove due care.

- **(Factor 3)** Early recognition that *[PL has contributed to the accident in some way]{.underline}*. Case turns attention to the person making the claim as well as the DF bc it takes two to tort.

**[Adams v. Bullock (NY 1919)]{.underline}** (Cardozo)-- Boy swings huge wire around which catches onto the wiring of trolley and electrocutes him.

- **Holding:** Negligence may not be imputed where reasonable care was taken (untaken precautions are not prohibitively expensive -- just ordinary care would suffice) & conduct was lawful (operating trolley line is legal & certain risks come along with it that society must accept), but an extraordinary injury happened (unforeseeable).

- **(Factor 4)** Accident was *[not foreseeable]{.underline}*. Cardozo claims that only a freak accident would've made the accident happen.

  - Cardozo doesn't go into the details of the situation.

- **(Factor 5)** The *[untaken precautions]{.underline}* of the trolley company are so expensive.

  - Party arguing for negligence: Point to all the untaken precautions (e.g. court doesn't mention the unusual configuration, place wire further away from people, insulate it, put up a sign, etc.)

    - Burden on PL to show that there were alternative precautions that could have been taken but weren't

  - Party arguing for no negligence: (1) Too expensive (2) Untaken precautions would've have worked.

**[Learned Hand's Economic Formulation of Negligence (BPL)]{.underline}**

Conduct is negligent where the *expected* 'cost' of the accident outweighs the cost of precaution. This is seen sometimes as the intuitive process we do anyway in deciding what the reasonable person would do.

- **[U.S. v. Carroll Towing Co (NY 1947)]{.underline}**

<!-- -->

- Appellant owned a barge chartered by a RR company. The barge was moored to the end of the pier and had a large cargo of flour

<!-- -->

- Appellant hired a tug company (Carroll Towing Co.) to drill out one of the barges. Carroll readjusted mooring lines and barge broke free and sank.

<!-- -->

- The barge wouldn't have sunk if someone were aboard when the barge broke free. The "untaken precaution" here was that the guy was not there on the boat during the day with no excuse --- it was his job!

<!-- -->

- **Holding**: An owner has a duty to take care, and will be deemed negligent otherwise, when the **probability of an accident** multiplied by the **magnitude of the resulting injury** outweighs the **cost of taking adequate precautions**.

- **Negligence if B \< P\*L**; no negligence otherwise

  - **B = burden of taking adequate precautions** (precautions that a reasonable person would've taken)

  - **P = probability of accident (if the precaution is untaken)**

    - P means foreseeable probability, NOT actual probability

      - rarely does a defendant escape liability purely because a risk was unforeseeable

      - foreseeability needs to be applied to the "reasonable person", not the actual person

  - **L = losses/damages for accident** (Losses attributable to DF's actions.)

    - Losses must be foreseeable to the "reasonable person"

    - E.g. if DF's actions could've lessened the probability of accident by 20%, then L should be 20% of total losses from the accident.

  - We want people only to prevent accidents to some extent --- if the accidents don't cost too much

  - the problem with building in foreseeability creates a bad incentive to be lazy about discovery of risks

- Unclear whose harms count? Cost to just DF, or to the entire world? **Three ways to understand L**:

  - Harm to entire world, all harm resulting from accident to everyone

  - Harm only to the defendant

  - Harm for which a defendant could expect to be held liable

    - Proximate cause/scope of liability taken into account.

      - Limited to foreseeable losses?

- Unclear whether this rule is ex post **[(furthering aim of fairness; BPL is about treating others like yourself)]{.underline}** or ex ante **[(furthering the tort aim of deterrence)]{.underline}**

  - Is this something you're supposed to take account of when planning

  - Is it just a tool for judges to apply to figure out whether conduct was reasonable? Judicial common sense simply articulated (there's elements of BPL in *[Adams]{.underline}* as well)?

    - [On EXAM: **Characterize facts as both big B/P/L and small B/P/L to argue both sides** (e.g. loss of flour from barge -- big (starving troops in Europe -- lose the war!) v. small (not as important as weapons & it didn't cause collateral damage))]{.mark}

- **[Criticism]{.underline}**:

1.  Measurement/info costs and confusion

    a.  Litigation costs in measuring and analyzing these factors

    b.  *how* are you going to measure each variable?

    c.  response: you don't need precision as long as it's pretty obvious comparatively between the two sides

<!-- -->

2.  Too Deterrence Oriented

    a.  concerned at least as much with deterring future conduct as it is with remedying past wrongs

    b.  Response: this calculus is fair because it's putting you on exact equal footing with everyone else

<!-- -->

3.  Commensurability

    a.  how do you compare the loss of a leg over putting up a guard rail?

    <!-- -->

    b.  **Counter:** (1) Insurance companies, government, worker's compensation does this all the time, (2) If the standard is a reasonable person, then you have to ask the hard question -- would a reasonable person be monetizing body parts? A child's life?

        i.  also here the defendant has to do the calculus, whereas in other areas of tort the court does it

<!-- -->

4.  Takes unitary concept and turns it into something complicated

5.  Omits whether a party engaged in impartial deliberation about a possible course of action

6.  Implication that sometimes we will tolerate risking injury

<!-- -->

7.  Juries might ignore it --- it's rare in jury instruction and when given is accompanied by the option to ignore

    a.  this is more of a way to identify common sense factors

    b.  JURIES HATE BPL. There is value in establishing safe harbors just so that we don't have to give BPL assessments to the jury. Juries hating BPL generally discourages companies from doing a cost-benefit analysis, and we want to encourage cost-benefit analysis

- **[Counter to criticism]{.underline}**: BPL is useful when one component clearly outweighs the other, so there is no need for expensive measurement & difficult commensurability questions:

  i.  *[Bolton]{.underline}* -- UK cricket case

      1.  PL is so high, B doesn't even need to be considered (court doesn't even consider it, but if court relied in BPL, it would be an easy case.

  ii. Cardozo in *[Adams]{.underline}*

      1.  B is SO large, negligence found.

  iii. *[Eckert]{.underline}* -- Man dies while saving a child from train

       1.  L is so large because value of human life is very highly regarded by courts.

<!-- -->

- Hand's reasoning:

  a.  In traditional CL, contributory negligence completely barred PL's claim, but in admiralty law (applies here), rule was complete comparative negligence regime.

  b.  No doctrine established by case law because bc it depends on the circumstances. Use the circumstances to fill out BPL formula and weigh B from PL.

  c.  Focuses on the actions of bargee -- he was absent from Anna C.

      i.  Learned Hand frames it as just not reporting to work, which has very LOW B costs, so B is so low that PL clearly outweighs, hence negligence found.

      ii. Counter: Could frame B as having to stay on the barge 24/7.

**[3^rd^ Restatement on Torts (R3T) on Hand Formula]{.underline}**

- **Negligence Defined**: A **person acts negligently** if the person does not exercise **reasonable care under all the circumstances**. Primary factors to consider in ascertaining whether the person's conduct lacks reasonable care are the **foreseeable likelihood that the person's conduct will result in harm**, the **foreseeable severity of any harm that may ensue**, and the **burden of precautions to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm.**

- Correctly articulates the difference between probability and foreseeability (BPL is about foreseeable probability, not actual)

### Standard of Care

Whether the duty of care owed depends on the actor or the context.

- **"**Care that a **reasonable person** would've taken **in the circumstances**"

  - What are the circumstances?

    - Which circumstances apply & how do we tailor the standard of care to bring in the circumstances into consideration? (See *[Bethel]{.underline}* and *[Groh]{.underline}*)

      - **[On EXAM: Argue both sides by advocating application of ordinary and extraordinary care.]{.mark}**

  - Who is a reasonable person?

    - 

#### Ordinary Care

**What constitutes ordinary care under the circumstances is** left to the **[jury]{.underline}**. How much do we trust the jury to make the right decision?

**[Bethel v. New York City Transit Authority (NY 1998)]{.underline}** -- PL was hurt on DF's bus when the "wheelchair accessible seat" collapsed under him.

- **Holding**: Standard of care that should be required of common carriers is the traditional negligence standard of reasonable care under the circumstances. The traditional rule of common carrier's duty of extraordinary care (a special carve out) is no longer viable.

- **Arguments for ordinary standard of care [(use on EXAM)]{.mark}**

  - Reasonable care is flexible enough to take into account unusual circumstances.

  - No need for other standards of care because reasonable care incorporates it -- the fact that it's a common carrier & the history that resulted in the special carve-out, etc.

  - Reasonable person takes into account all of the facts, special relationships to other people required of him.

  - Now lowering the standards won't put people as much at risk because there's much more regulation and technology is better

  - Public policy: Don't want to burden provides of public services like common carriers.

- **Counter**: CA has kept the special carve out ("utmost care") negligence standard because: (1) common carrier has the capacity to hurt a lot of people (scale of danger), and (2) signal to common carriers to take care (extra deterrence)

#### Extraordinary Care

**[Wood v. Groh (Kan. 2000)]{.underline}** -- PL was accidently shot with DF's gun fired by his 15-year-old son. Son had used a screwdriver to open his father's locked gun cabinet and had removed the unloaded gun as well as ammunition.

- **Holding**: The parents in this case owed the highest duty to protect the public from the misuse of the gun, a dangerous instrumentality, stored in their home.

- Arguments for "highest care"/special carve out:

  - We don't need to and don't want to incentivize gun ownership

  <!-- -->

  - Fairness argument: It's not common to have guns around the house, so we should put burden of extra care on those who do (Counter: To own a gun is actually pretty common here -- Kansas).

  <!-- -->

  - Policy argument: communicating to gun owners that they must exercise special care

#### 

#### Emergency Doctrine

- A person confronting an emergency not of his/her own making is required to exhibit only an honest exercise of judgment.

  - **Justification for the carve-out**: Because of emergency circumstances (unforeseeable, little time to react, etc.), person in that situation should not be held to the same standard of care as someone confronted with a foreseeable occurrence.

  - **Keep carve-out:** Helps to focus the jury bc even though they can take into account the emergency situation in standard for ordinary care, this helps point it out to them.

  <!-- -->

  - **Get rid of it**: All part of the "circumstances" that are part of the ordinary care standard anyway. Carving it out gives the standard less flexibility.

### Objective & Subjective Standard

Objectivity or subjectivity of standard of care depends on the degree to which a person's shortcoming or disability is **evident** to others. Some shortcomings will not be taken into account at all.

#### Objective Standard 

**[Vaughan v. Menlove (1837)]{.underline}** -- DF should be held to the standard of ordinary prudence in spite of the variances in judgment and ability; stupidity & lack of intelligence is not part of the "circumstances", hence no excuse.

- Facts: DF landowner piled hay in a way that created a fire hazard to neighbors, including the PL.

- ***Mental Ability** -- usually not part of the "circumstances"*

- **Policy for objective standard for mental ability**: (1) Incentivizes less capable people to bring themselves up to the standard of conduct of ordinary people. (2) Subjective standard would result in basically a different rule for everyone, which would be difficult to manage (administrative argument).

  - **Against**: Fairness argument -- It's not fair to hold people with differential mental ability to the same standard as everyone else.

#### Exceptions to Objective Standard:

- **[[Children]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- **Semi-objective standard**: Expected to exercise the degree of care that would be reasonable in a child of similar age, intelligence, and experience except when children engage in "adult activities".

  - NY: Under 4 -- no negligence/IL: Under 7 -- no negligence. (RULE)

    - **Pros**: With this rule, PL can save time & \$\$ that would've be spent trying to sue kids.

    - **Cons**: No deterrence effect to regulate the kids' behavior.

    - **What if neuroscience** tells us that 19-year-olds are just as immature as 17-year-olds? The line has to be drawn somewhere -- dose custom/culture dictate this?

  - "Adult activity" -- depends on state.

    - **[Goss v. Allen (1976) --]{.underline}** skiing is not an adult activity because it's **recreational** & unlike driving, operating a motorboat, does not require (at least by NJ) that the minor be **licensed**.

- **[[Infirm Adults]{.mark}:]{.underline}** Typically, physical infirmities are taken into account in judging the reasonableness of behavior (semi-objective standard), but mental infirmities are not.

  - ***Physical Disability** -- usually part of the "circumstances"*

    - **Subjective Standard -- [Roberts v. Ramsbottom (1980)]{.underline} --** DF liable bc (1) he failed to realized, after one or two problems on the road, that he was physically unfit to continue driving for the day. Physical disabilities are considered part of the "circumstances" & given these circumstances, a "reasonable person" would've stopped driving. (2) he had some (although limited) control over his actions; loss of consciousness might've sufficed.

    - Facts: Old man suffered stroke a few minutes before setting out on a drive & caused accident.

    - **Policy for subjective standard for physical disability**: (1) Ease of proof (easier to prove physical disability than a mental one).

    - **Against**: Loses some deterrence. If physical disabilities are subject to objective standard, those with disabilities will take heighted precautions. (**Counter**: See *[Ramsbottom]{.underline}* -- subjective standard works against DF by raising the standard of care due to the physical disability).

    - *[Hammontree]{.underline}* -- are Jenner's epileptic seizures a mental or physical disability? [On EXAM, argue that something is like a mental ability if you don't want it to count, argue as physical if you want it to count as "circumstances"]{.mark}

- **[[Experts]{.underline}]{.mark}**

  - ***Superior Attributes***

    - **R2T 289(b):** The DF, in addition to exercising the "attention, perception of the circumstances, memory, knowledge of other pertinent matters, intelligence, and judgment as would a reasonable person, must also exercise such "superior" attributes on the listed items as the "actor himself has".

      - **So subjective standard for superior mental ability, but objective for inferior mental ability.**

      - Tension with *[Bethel]{.underline}*?

    - Expertise can cut both ways (*[Goss]{.underline}*):

      - HELP: (1) Expert was not negligent bc his expertise -- it might've been negligent for novice to make the turn, but not him. (R2T 289(b), *[Tankersley]{.underline}*) (2) Even an expert couldn't have avoided an accident, meaning there was something wrong with circumstances (the turn), not the expert.

      - HURT: Expert should've known better (R2T 289(b)).

#### Personal Characteristics That Become Part of the Circumstances -- HURT OR HELP?

- ***[Little Rock v. Tankersley (1890)]{.underline}*** -- To determine whether an actor is negligent, actor must be judged by comparison with acts of a person of ordinary prudence under similar circumstances -- age, sex, physical condition. **Characteristics HURT the party.**

  - Facts**:** A woman jumps off a moving train.

  - **Counter** -- so characteristic would HELP: (1) train should've known it has all kinds of passengers on it & should've taken steps so a woman can alight safely (**CLEGG COURT**), (2) women don't know how trains work bc they stay home & shouldn't be held to the same standard as a man.

- ***[Daniels v. Clegg (1873)]{.underline}*** -- Degree of diligence required of incompetent persons should take account of their incompetence; persons encountering an obviously incompetent person have a correspondingly higher duty of care to avoid injury. **Characteristics HELP the party.**

  - Facts: Young female buggy driver crashes with wagon.

  - **[The characteristics have an effect on both PL's and DF's standards of care.]{.mark}**

  - **Counter** -- so characteristic would HURT: She should've have been driving anyway (**TANKERSLEY COURT**).

**[4 lessons from *[Tankersley]{.underline}* and *[Clegg]{.underline}*]{.mark}**

1.  Taking characteristics into account can help to lower the standard by lowering expectations. (*[Clegg]{.underline}*). Note that this cuts both ways and can work to heighted the standard (*[Ramsbottom, Tankersley]{.underline}*).

2.  If you're not allowed to use something as part of the circumstances (e.g. sex, mental ability), use a proxy that would work better (e.g. height, physical composition).

3.  On a spectrum that runs from the internal/subjective circumstance to external/objective circumstance, where do these circumstances (e.g. sex, inexperience, weather, age) go? People (jury and judge) have different instincts about where things go on the spectrum & this is where lawyers fight out the battles.

4.  Both PL & DF's negligence is taken into account. DF's internal circumstances are part of PL's external circumstances -- so in judging for contributory negligence, DF's internal circumstances are taken into account as part of PL's external, objective circumstances! Vice versa. (e.g. *[Clegg]{.underline}*)

### Roles of Judge and Jury

#### Negligence and No Negligence as a Matter of Law

- If reasonable people could disagree about the finding of negligence/breach of duty to exercise reasonable care 🡺 submit to jury.

- If reasonable people could NOT disagree about finding of negligence/breach of duty to exercise reasonable care 🡺 JMOL (judge makes decision, no role for jury).

#### Holmes and Cardozo on Role of Judge and Jury in Deciding Negligence

- **[Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. v. [Goodman]{.mark} (1927), [Holmes]{.mark}: YES DIRECTED VERDICTS)]{.underline}**

  - Facts: Truck driver goes on railroad tracks without getting out his truck to check if coast is clear & gets hit by train.

  - **Holding**: Directed verdict granted because when standard of conduct is clear (it's clear that you don't cross railroad tracks without getting of your vehicle to check -- not really), it should be decided as a matter of law.

    - By granting directed verdict, Holmes is basically making a bright-line rule.

    - Policy: Holmes is bothered by how results vary for very similar situations because it's up to jury and after a bunch of cases, judges sort of know where the jury will go.

    - Counter: (1) Institutional competence -- are judges better at discerning what is "ordinary care", here Holmes NEVER DROVE! (2) Rules are not appropriate where circumstances surrounding the conduct in question are variable.

- **[[Pokora]{.mark} v. Wabash Railway Co. (1934), [Cardozo]{.mark}: NO DIRECTED VERDICTS]{.underline}**

  - Facts are similar.

  - **Holding**: When it's not clear what course of action to take (actually it would be dangerous to get out of the car as well & Holmes wouldn't know bc he doesn't drive), we leave it to jury's judgment.

    - **Goodman** should be limited to its facts & Holmes' bright-line rule language is all dicta.

    - *[Adams]{.underline}* -- Cardozo decided that trolly company was not negligent as a matter of law.

    - **Rules make it easy for judge to take the negligence question away from jury. Standards usually result in the negligence question going to the jury.**

      - Unless the trigger for the rule is a question of fact, then it goes to jury.

#### Negligence Per Se (Statutory Violations)

Violation of a safety statute command can be negligence *per se* if purpose of statute is to set a safety standard, but not necessarily if it just codifies existing common law.

- **[Martin v. Herzog (1920, Cardozo)]{.underline}** -- the unexcused omission of a statutory obligation is negligence *per se*.

  - Facts: Buggy driver sues wagon driver & wagon driver argues for contributory negligence bc buggy driver didn't have lights on.

  - Arguments for: (1) Legislature provided us with a standard of reasonable care. (2) A reasonable person wouldn't violate a statute.

**Defenses:**

A.  **Legally cognizable excuse**

- **[Tedla v. Ellman (1939)]{.underline}** -- Non-adherence to a statute that **merely codifies** a **general rule of conduct**, rather than affixing a standard of care, does not necessarily constitute negligence *per se*; There is an implied exception for cases in which compliance with the statute would involve a greater risk of harm than violation.

  - Facts: PL was struck by DF's vehicle while she was walking on the wrong side of traffic (violation of statute). PL argued traffic was much heavier on the side that the statute required her to walk on.

- Non-legally cognizable excuses: Excuse does not get to jury and DF will be found negligence as a matter of law (e.g. speeding bc he was driving his son to school and he was late).

B.  **Purpose of statute**

- [On Exam: argue for both widening and narrowing of statute's scope by looking to (1) legislative history or preamble, and (2) whether the violation does or does not increase the risk of harm to those in the PL's situation.]{.mark}

  - Statute that has it's own penalty -- cuts towards no negligence per se?

- **[Di Ponzio v. Riordan (1997)]{.underline}** -- Violation of ordinance requiring that car engine be turned off while car is being filled with gas. Car rolled back and pinned PL against his car, but court ruled for DF because ordinance was the city's fire code.

- **R2T 286 -- Exception to Negligence Per Se for Statutory Violations:**

  - The court may adopt as the **standard of conduct of a reasonable man the requirements of a legislative enactment or an administrative regulation** whose **purpose** is found to be exclusively or in part

A.  To protect a class of person which includes the one whose interest is invaded, and

B.  To protect the particular interest which is being invaded, and

C.  To protect that interest against the kind of harm which has resulted, and

D.  To protect that interest against the particular hazard from which the harm results.

**Policy for NPS**: Administrative competence argument for why courts should give deference for agencies' regulations in heavily regulated industries like vaccines, pesticide, aircraft, power plants bc they have more info/expertise than judges/jury.

- **Counter**: Rule v. standard type argument -- NPS is a bright-line rule & comes with its disadvantages.

#### Custom

- Custom can serve as guidance for determining what is proper standard of conduct, but is not dispositive of the reasonable person standard.

  - Non-compliance with custom may be used offensively to show negligence, while compliance with custom may be used defensively to show reasonable care.

- For something to be a custom, it must be something done by MOST of those whose behavior is relevant to the issue.

  - **[The TJ Hooper II (1932, Hand) (compliance)]{.underline}** -- Custom not dispositive of duties under reasonable person standard. Conduct above and beyond that which is customary may sometimes be required.

  <!-- -->

  - Facts: DF tries to fight negligence with evidence showing that the widespread provision of radios was not custom, but court found negligence bc "there are precautions so imperative that even their universal disregard will not excuse their omission."

  - What is customary changes very slowly; **technology changes faster.**

    - **Counter/argument for deference to custom:** Question of institutional competence. Would a layman (jury), judge know better than a practitioner what is "reasonable under the circumstances" in a highly technical field?

      - **For negligence (non-compliance):** (1) harm was foreseeable (2) not that high of a burden bc most people in the same situation do it.

#### Interaction of Statutes and Customs

1.  Statute, but no custom 🡺 negligence per se analysis

2.  Statute, but custom requires more 🡺 regulatory compliance does not shield you from liability. Custom evidence can be admitted & may speak to what a "reasonable person under the circumstances" would've done.

    a.  Law takes time to catch up to customs just like customs takes time to catch up to technology.

3.  **Custom and statute contradict each other**

    a.  Fail to comply with statute, but comply with custom 🡺 NPS, but custom evidence can come in as excuse.

    b.  **[Comply with statute, but fail to comply with custom 🡺 Reasonable person standard & evidence of both can come it.]{.mark}**

        i.  [**ON EXAM:** Try to get to this unanswered question!!!!!]{.mark}

#### Malpractice

- Special standard of care for professionals:

  - **Majority Rule**: compliance with custom insulates the defendant from liability

    - Failure to comply with professional custom is malpractice.

      - **For**: Juries don't do well with complicated medical info.

      - **Against**: Takes the whole question away from jury, which is problematic when there are questions of fact that require jury's judgment.

  - **Minority Rule**: follows general reasonableness standard, which makes evidence of compliance/non-compliance with professional custom admissible, but not dispositive.

- For **medical malpractice** suits:

  - **"two schools of though"/"respectable minority":** as long as defendant complied with a school of thought or practice followed by a respectable minority, no malpractice. This is recognized in some states, but not in others.

    - **[Gala v. Hamilton (1998)]{.underline}** -- local or general anesthetic

**[Sheeley v. Memorial Hospital (1998)]{.underline}** -- Abandons **"same or similar" communities** test in favor of national standard; A physician is under a duty to use the degree of care and skill that is expected of a **reasonably competent practitioner in the same class to which he/she belongs**, acting in the **same or similar circumstances.**

- Arguments from party blocking witness:

1.  Different specialty.

    a.  Counter: Doctors with different specialties have expertise in this procedure.

2.  Hasn't been practicing.

    a.  Counter: Practice hasn't changed much.

- Arguments for the shift from same or similar locality to national rule:

  - Same community requirement led to conspiracy of silence (doctors don't want to back-stab each other)

  - Increase in tech/info-sharing leads to similar standards across nation.

  - Incentivizes doctors nationwide to up their standards to national level.

    - Allowing a break for doctor's in small villages would result in worse medical care in those areas.

  - N.B. Fairness argument cuts both ways: (1) Not fair to hold small doctor's offices to the same level as a fancy big hospital in a big city with better budget & better educated doctors. (2) Not fair for PL to have to live with botched procedure just because he's from a small town, not a big city.

**Common Knowledge Doctrine**

- **[Leonard v. Watsonville Community Hospital]{.underline}** -- If doctor's conduct was obviously negligent to laymen, you don't need a medical expert to tell you he did something wrong.

  - **Facts**: Clamp was left inside PL after surgery & doctor claimed he followed custom of not counting instruments, but court rule compliance with that custom does not establish standard of care because this is a matter of common knowledge.

# Role of Plaintiff - Contributory & Comparative Negligence

- All forms of these negligence regimes exist in different states.

- **Affirmative defense** of **contributory negligence** is a complete bar to recovery for PL.

  - DF has burden of proof to establish PL's negligence.

  - Maryland still has contributory negligence regime

  - Modern trend is for comparative negligence regimes

- Comparative negligence regimes apportion the damages to % of fault of the parties.

1.  **Pure comparative negligence:** damages apportioned proportionally to % of fault

2.  **Modified comparative negligence:** damages apportioned proportionally to percentage of fault, up until plaintiff is 50% or \>50% responsible, depending on jurisdiction, in which case plaintiff recovers nothing.

- **Pro**: (1) Moral blame concept (if PL is more responsible than DF, he shouldn't be able to recover -- think of a situation where DF is 1% responsible) (2) Incentivizes PL to game the system if we allow recovery when PL is mostly responsible & Does not provide enough incentives to be careful. (3) Administrative ease -- at a certain point, we don't have to make the determination.

- **Con**: (1) Not fair & bad distribution: same harsh applications as in contributory negligence results; there's no meaningful difference between PL being 49% and 51% to blame. (**[Li v. Yellow Cab]{.underline}**) (2) Doesn't do enough to incentivize DF to be careful. (note that this cuts bothways -- pure comparative neg. might depress DF's activity level)

- **[EXAM: What if there are multiple DFs and one PL, or multiple PLs? How should that affect the analysis? (e.g. BP)]{.mark}**

**[Li v. Yellow Cab Co. (CA 1975)]{.underline} --** The pure comparative negligence doctrine should replace the contributory negligence doctrine.

- CA court's bold move: Contributory negligence was codified in CA statute, but court says that legislature intended to codify CL as it was & CL has changed to prefer contributory negligence.

  - Compare to Maryland court: Legislature has tried to change CL's contributory negligence, but failed to codify it, so we can't do anything. THIS IS THE OPPOSITE APPROACH.

- Contributory negligence is inequitable bc it fails to distribute responsibility in proportion to fault. In a system where liability is based on fault, extent of fault should govern extent of liability.

# Duty 

- Whenever you do anything (action is defined very broadly -- e.g. if you built a house 20 years ago & failed to take care of it -- that's action and negligent act is failing to take care of it), there is a **duty to take reasonable care**.

  - [ON EXAM, just dispose of duty with: **"DF breached duty of reasonable care by XXX (negligent action)."** ]{.mark}

- In general, tort law imposes on people only a duty to take reasonable care to avoid injuring other people, and not a **[duty to rescue others from injuries by 3^rd^ parties that DF had no hand in creating (AFFIRMATIVE DUTY)]{.underline}**, though there are exceptions **[(and these are when you should discuss DUTY on exam).]{.mark}**

  - Some "exceptions":

    - Duty to rescue: if you started rescue, you have duty to rescue non-negligently.

      - Policy: By attempting rescue, others did not attempt rescue that might've been more successful bc you induced reliance.

      - **[BUT! What if you were the only one there? (THINK ABOUT THIS FOR EXAM)]{.mark}**

    - If you non-negligently create a danger to another person, you may have duty to warn the other person of that danger, and perhaps even to undertake a more active rescue. (**[Montgomery]{.underline}**)

  - **Look for** in fact pattern: **[Affirmative duty]{.underline}** created by **statute, omission, special relationship, or duty to warn.** Then, you should discuss duty a bit more.

  - Generally, there is **no [affirmative duty]{.underline} to others**; no good Samaritan law.

**Misfeasance**: DF negligently created a risk of harm.

**Nonfeasance**: DF who did not remove a risk of harm created by someone or something else.

- No affirmative duty for nonfeasance (bright-line rule) unless there is exception.

## Act v. Omission

**[The Moch Case (Cardozo) (NY, 1928)]{.underline}** - **Withdrawal of a benefit is an act of omission (nonfeasance), rather than act of commission (misfeasance);** **[This is negligent nonfeasance unaccompanied by malice & therefore no affirmative duty.]{.underline}**

- **Facts**: DF water works had a K with city to supply water for various purposes, including service at fire hydrants. Building caught fire & destroyed PL's warehouse & PL claimed that water company's failure to supply adequate water permitted the spread of fire.

- **HOLDING**: No CL tort action available to users of the water supplied to city.

## Duty v. Breach

**Institutional Competence & Standard v. Rules**:

- Duty is a question of law & decision is made by judge, meaning it's more of a bright-line rule

- Breach (Due Care) is a question of fact & decision is made by jury, meaning it's more of a standard.

- Both CL and Statue can create both.

**[Cuyler v. U.S. (Posner) (7^th^ cir., 2004)]{.underline}**

- Facts: Crazy nanny on military base abused children & that abuse ended up killing one of the kids. Parents sue U.S. through FTCA.

- Laws:

  - **Federal Torts Claim Act (FTCA):** The federal government is liable for the torts of its employees to the same extent under the law of the place where the tort took place.

  - **IL Statute (Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act)**: Variety of people (ranging from physicians to foster parents & childcare workers) having reasonable cause to believe a child known to them in their professional or official capacity may be an abused child or a neglected child shall immediately report to the IL Department of Children and Family Services.

    - U.S. concedes that they violated this statute.

  - **IL Common Law**: (1) Violation of statutory standard of care is prima facie evidence of negligence rather than negligence per se. **[(2) Statutory STANDARD OF CARE does not come into play unless the PL establishes that the DF owes a DUTY OF CARE to the person he injured.]{.underline}**

- **Issue**: Did IL CL or statute establish the hospital employee's duty of care to the child?

  - **CL**: No affirmative duty to rescue child from 3^rd^ party bc IL has no Good Samaritan law.

  - **Statute**: Not expressly. Only sanctions provided are criminal & disciplinary sanctions for willful violations. *If there were a provision for private right to obtain damages for the violation, there WOULD be an affirmative duty to the child.*

    - **Factors to consider** when considering whether to read damages remedy into a statute (implication of a private right of action): Whether

1.  PL is a member of the class for whose benefit the statute was enacted,

2.  It is consistent with the underlying purpose of the statute,

3.  PL's injury is one the statute was designed to prevent, and

4.  It is necessary to provide an adequate remedy for violations of the statute.

- **HOLDING**: No CL & statutory affirmative duty bc (1) statute already has its own sanctions, suggesting that it's meant to be separate from tort law, not an add on, and (2) those sanctions are imposed only for willful violation, suggesting reluctance to impose liability for mere negligence, and (3) statute had been amended multiple times & legislature had lots of opportunities to plug in damages remedy, and (4) the wide range of people covered by the statute cuts against imposing affirmative duty.

**Possible argument not taken by state regarding application of statute:**

- [Statutory purpose]{.underline} is just meant to keep a record, collect info, not to protect children ex ante. Therefore, negligence per se (or in this case, prima facie case) not applicable.

## Special Relationships

- An exception to the bright-line no duty rule for nonfeasance is when PL & DF are in a special relationship. (e.g. common carriers & innkeepers, parents & child-care professionals).

- In Tarasoff, CA SC takes this CL special relationship exception and **turns it into an affirmative duty between DF and a third party.**

**[Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California (1976)]{.underline}** -- Existence of a special relationship between a therapist and a patient creates **duty to warn the foreseeable victim to whom the patient poses a danger.**

- Court reasoning: Doctors already control patient's action by medication & tell others to prevent patient from harming others.

  - Counter/Criticism: It's very difficult to predict mental disease & behavior (not as concrete as physical disease).

- Tarasoff factors for when determining whether affirmative duty should exist:

  - Foreseeability of harm

  - Closeness of connection between D's conduct and harm suffered by P

  - Moral blame attached to D's conduct

  - Extent of burden on D and consequences for community if duty is imposed

  - Policy of preventing future harm

  - Availability, prevalence of insurance that is/would be available if duty is imposed.

<!-- -->

- **CA Legislature's Reaction**: Immune from liability for failure to warn unless patient communicated **serious threat of physical violence against a reasonably identifiable victim.** **Reasonable efforts to communicate the treat to victim & police satisfies duty to warn**.

- **Most states** have accepted, some have extended, **few** have rejected the CA statute's take on Tarasoff.

- **Requirement of reasonable care: MEANS YOU NEED A JURY.**

- Tension with Cuyler?

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Free to exercise best judgment without liability; proof that he judged wrongly is insufficient to establish negligence. However, when therapist does predict that a patient presents a serious danger of violence, failure to warn is negligent.

Risks of unnecessary warnings a reasonable price for lives of possible victims.

Public interest in protecting patients' right to privacy must be balanced against public interest in safety.

## Duty to Disclose -- Warnings

### Informed Consent

- **Doctrine of informed consent** requires the physician to inform the patient of risks of medical treatment, so that the patient may decide whether to take the risk of submitting to treatment, to seek alternative treatment, or to select no treatment at all.

  - Another function is to inform family members, open dialogue.

- Patient can sue even if doctor did everything right (not negligent), but a physical harm occurred if the PL would have decided not to consent to even properly provided treatment if he had been adequately informed.

- Two standards:

+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Reasonable-patient standard**   | - Requires physician to disclose info about the risks/benefits that a reasonable patient in **what the physician knows to be the patient's situation would wish to know.** |
|                                   |                                                                                                                                                                            |

+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

### Product Liability

- In most jurisdictions, there is a CL duty to **reasonable care to warn of risks** posed by product design.

- Jury decides the reasonable care taken to warn and takes into account **evidence of custom, statutory regulations.**

- Theory underlying liability for the failure to warn is that, once an adequate warning has been given, the purchaser rather than the product seller is the superior bearer of the risk of injury.

- **Adequacy of warning:**

  - **What is required is an "adequate" warning or instruction, typically of foreseeable risks**. Jury, or judge on directed verdicts, must make this call.

    - **Too much = label clutter & won't be read (Hood court's reasoning)**

      - **[Hood v. Ryobi America Corp. (4^th^ Cir, 1999)]{.underline} -- Using BPL in deciding whether a warning is adequate**, court finds that warnings to not detach the blade guards is adequate, and warnings of dangers of using the saw without the blade guards in place is not necessary.

        - **Court:** In BPL -- there has been only one accident in 15 years, so the PL is low, while the B is high bc resulting label cluttering.

        - **Counter:** (1) Just four words would suffice "blade may cut off" (2) the fact that the blade may do this is NOT common knowledge.

    - **Causation issue** like in informed consent: PL must prove that he would not have used the product (or in a manner that he did), if an adequate warning had been given.

      - **Heeding presumption**: presumption that PL would have heeded an adequate warning if it had been given. Probably not true, but (1) w/o PL may not able to prove causation, and (2) creating insurance protection for the unlucky few who suffer side effects (counter: insurance through tort is expensive)

- **The warning/design defect connection**:

  - When **a reasonable alternative design** can eliminate a product defect, mere warning about these risks does not insulate the DF from liability.

  - When there is no reasonable alternative design, there used to be **patent danger rule** (adequate warning shields from liability), but **overruled in many jurisdictions**, implying that jury may find that certain products are too dangerous to be on the market even when their risks are known and understood.

  - **In this area involving the intersection between design defect & warnings law, the [tension between consumer sovereignty]{.underline} and the [protective goals of tort law]{.underline} continues.**

# Federal Pre-emption

## Role of Statutes & Types of Pre-emption

- Statutes borrowing from CL (CWA, FTCA)

- Statute itself creating tort liability (ANCRA -- **[Cuyler]{.underline}**)

- **Federal pre-emption occurs when a federal statute trumps/eliminates state tort law.**

  - Express: Statute itself has a pre-emption clause.

  - Implied

    - Field: Congress intended to have exclusive authority in this area.

    - Conflict: When state tort law conflicts/makes it difficult to adhere to federal statute.

## Pre-emption in Duty to Warn

- **[Stengel v. Metronic (9^th^ Cir, 2013)]{.underline}** -- Even when there is an express pre-emption clause in a federal statute, parallel requirements of State tort law are not pre-empted.

  - **Issue**: Is the Stengel's state-law negligence claim (breached **duty to warn** by not telling the known risks to FDA) pre-empted by the MDA?

  - Law:

    - **MDA**: For Class III equipment, must informed FDA risks & there is an **express pre-emption clause**:

      - "No state or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect with respect to a devise intended for human use any requirement --

1.  which is **[different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device]{.underline}**, and

2.  which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.

    - **AZ State tort law**: liability for failing to report known risks associated with use of medical device to the FDA.

    <!-- -->

    - **Counter**: Additional damages that result from the state tort claim constitutes "in addition to" what the federal statute requires? **Counter-counter**: Additional damages are okay as long as the state law is requiring the same thing. **Counter-counter-counter**: Congress intended to not punish more than federal statute, field pre-emption or conflict? Maybe conflict by bankrupting company, meaning it eventually can't adhere to MDA?

## Pre-emption in Exxon/Punitive Damages

- Are PDs pre-empted by the CWA?

  - Court says no bc if we follow that argument, compensatory damages would be pre-empted as well.

  - If Congress intended for field pre-emption, then CD & PD would be pre-empted, but Congress must be clear about its intent to do so (e.g. have a pre-emption clause like in **[Stengel]{.underline}**)

## STRICT LIABILITY -- Restatement Standards

A.  **Third Restatement** -- Latest Approach to the Law

    a.  [Sets out TWO requirements to be *abnormally dangerous*:]{.mark}

        i.  Creates a foreseeable and highly significant risk of harm and injury despite the exercise of reasonable care (most believe this embodies **proximate cause**)

            1.  Taking more caution when under SL will not have much effect because of the inherent danger. So controls both the *activity level* and the *care level*.

        ii. Activity is not of common usage

            1.  Frame "common" to make different arguments -- common to normal people? Common to an area? Common industrial practice?

        iii. Comments suggest considering R2T's factors as well.

B.  **First Restatement** -- Uses *ultra-hazardous* instead of *abnormally dangerous* but achieves the same purpose

    a.  High risk of harm 🡪 cannot eliminate even with care exercised and requires that it is not common (also called un-natural per *Rylands*)

C.  [**Second Restatement** -- More nuanced in the factors. Sort of a balancing test when deciding whether the court should use SL for the *abnormal activities*.]{.mark}

    a.  [Existence of a high degree of risk of some harm]{.mark}

    b.  [Likelihood that the harm that results from it will be great]{.mark}

    c.  **[[Inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care]{.underline}]{.mark}**

    d.  [Extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage]{.mark}

    e.  [Inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on]{.mark}

    f.  **[[Extent to which its value to the community is outweighed by its dangerous attributes]{.underline}]{.mark}**

        i.  [SL is a tool for building policies: the sixth factor is what the legislature does in terms of weighing the societal costs and benefits]{.mark}

D.  [D**O NOT FORGET ALL OTHER ELEMENTS OF TORTS ARE NEEDED: DUTY, CAUSATION (CIF & PC/SOL), DAMAGES**]{.mark}

    1.  [Also, don't forget the **role of PL (defenses of contributory, comparative negligence apply)!!!**]{.mark}

    2.  **[SCOPE OF LIABILITY: There is only SL if engaging in the relevant activity is not only the CiF, but also the PC of the harm that PL suffered.]{.mark}**

        a.  **[Harm must fall within the bucket of reasons why we made the activity SL.]{.mark}**

        b.  [**NO SL if** harm results from Act of God, unforeseeable intervention, or PL's knowledge of danger.]{.mark}

E.  **Application in Case Law**

    a.  **[Doerr v. Goldsmith (2013)]{.underline}** -- accident occurred when PL was riding bike and DF's dog ran across in front of him.

        i.  Old law: For animals, if there are vicious & had dangerous propensity + was known, SL applied. If not, N. For escape, if animal escapes + natural known mischief occurs, SL.

        ii. **Holding**: Court bypasses by saying that dog running across were the actions of the DFs (like throwing a football), so N applies.

        iii. SL is imposed when DF is the CCA (knowledge requirement). It's a test to figure out whether DF or PL was the CCA.

    b.  **[Connecticut Horse Case]{.underline}** -- horse bites boy.

        i.  Even if you don't know/have reason to know dangerous propensities of your animal, you are subject to liability for harm done if negligent. (NEGLIGENCE REGIME)

            1.  **Holding**: Court also says that horses have a natural inclination to bite, which bends strongly towards liability while remaining in the negligence regime.

            2.  LESSON: You can shape negligence so that it looks like SL.

    c.  **[Rylands v. Fletcher (England, 1868)]{.underline}** -- SL for damages caused by "non-natural use" of land.

        i.  Two factors developed to determine "ultra hazardous" activities for which CL would be imposed: (1) degree of danger and (2) how common was it in area (gets to the CCA -- who knew the risks?)

    d.  **[Indiana Harbor Belt R.R. v. American Cyanamid Co. (Posner, 1990)]{.underline}** -- D manufacturer that shipped 20,000 gallons of toxic & flammable chemical in a leased railroad tank care. PL was company that switched the cars between railroads & car leaked the chemical while waiting to be switched.

        i.  **Holding:** No SL bc (1) SL for carriers of dangerous substances when there are explosions bc it destroys evidence of negligence. Here it's just a leak. **[(2) Impossible for SL to have an AL effect in these kinds of cases bc there is no alternative[. (3) Accident caused by carelessness (than inherent characteristic of the activity) -- implies that it is feasible to avoid accident by taking more care, WHICH WORKS AGAINST SL!!!]{.underline}]{.mark}**

## SL v. N: Care and Activity Dials

A.  [[CARE & ACTIVITY DIAL]{.underline}]{.mark}: courts manage **effect** on *activity* or *care levels* when deciding which standard of care. For SL, the individual controls this because the court does not.

    a.  [[Application of the Restatement and Posner's Opinion]{.underline}: If you can take (more) care to eliminate the risk you are in the world of negligence. If you cannot eliminate the risk with care, then you are in the world of strict liability. Restatement addresses both: cannot reduce danger with reasonable and not common so activity level should go down (*Indiana Harbor*)]{.mark}

    b.  **[Huang argues: SL and N influence both Care and Activity Levels]{.mark}**

        i.  Taking care is relevant to activities within SL: (1) Actor chooses to be more careful to avoid harm, (2) but sometimes can decrease activity level to reduce risk of harm in the first place. Actors can decide based on their *internalization of risks* under SL to change care or activity levels.

        ii. **For negligence,** (1) if standard of care is very high (B), then PL may lower activity level or (2) court can say you're negligent if you do an activity this much, basically setting AL as well (not adopted in courts, but a possible alternative).

        iii. Re-scoping allows you to argue across boundaries of SL and N.

## SL v. N: Institutional Competence and Aims of Tort Law 

A.  Individual Decisions and Role of Courts:

    a.  **SL** 🡪 Liable for harm for certain types of activities despite level of care. Activity level itself is the liability, even though care level can still be affected**. Individual figures out activity level & care level**. Pay your way.

    b.  [**N** 🡪 **Court/jury determines whether the care level is sufficient (court determines CCA; labeling DF as neg = CCA)**,]{.mark} but also affects activity level (individual determines). Pay your way unless you took the appropriate care.

    c.  **Institutional competence question**: Do actors make better determinations about who the CCA is or does jury/court? **[[Institutional argument for SL:]{.underline}]{.mark}**

        i.  [Individuals are better at determining CCA.]{.mark}

        ii. [Courts rely on **[customary evidence]{.underline} for negligence analysis, but custom may be off-based bc the industry is behind times or may be colluding**.]{.mark}

B.  **[If SL works so well, why do we need N? [Is SL better for finding the cheapest cost avoider]{.underline}?]{.mark}**

    a.  [If N is good enough for controlling activity and care levels, we shouldn't go to SL bc other aims of tort law (fairness & blameworthiness) push for N. N is default and should resort to SL only if N doesn't suffice. (Posner)]{.mark}

# Causation In Fact

## Types of Causation in Fact (CiF)

### But-for Causation

a.  Requires a determination whether "but for" the DF's negligence (or breach of another applicable standard of care) the PL would have suffered injury or damage? No -- liable if also proximate cause; Yes -- not liable.

b.  **DF's argument**: Construct a counter-factual (e.g. had the lights been on...would still have crashed into the tree) to say that the outcome would not be changed.

c.  **[7WTC (2^nd^ Cir, 2012)]{.underline}** -- PL claims that negligent building was a CiF of the destruction of the building during 9/11, but court implies that the terrorist attack was the dominant cause, so DF's arguendo "negligent" building was not CiF & grants summary judgment to DF.

    i.  "It is simply incompatible with **common sense and experience (judge's common sense)** to hold that DF were required to design & construct a building that would survive the events of 9/11."

    ii. **Counter**: (1) Reasonable jury could conclude that the falling rocks due to the bad building contributed to the collapse or something else, and (2) judge ignores evidence on a very factual issue of what may have caused the destruction, etc., just says terrorist attacks trumps any other reason, and therefore other reason (neg. building) is not CiF.

d.  **Informed Consent Cases (Watford Concurrence in [Stengel]{.underline}, [Cuyler]{.underline})**

    i.  Even after PL has proved the failure of the DF to make proper disclosure, proof of causal connection between that failure & PL's injury is required, meaning that PL must show that he would've declined the treatment/use if he had been given the info about risks.

    ii. [**Two Standards** -- a difference of how much subjectivity (the circumstances of the patient) are taken into account.]{.mark}

        1.  [**Fully objective standard:** Whether an objectively reasonable person would've declined treatment had info been disclosed.]{.mark}

        2.  [**Semi-objective**: Whether a reasonable person **[in the PL's position]{.underline}** would have declined treatment had info been disclosed.]{.mark}

            a.  [Protects interest of idiosyncratic patients]{.mark}

    iii. **Watford Concurrence in [Stengel]{.underline}**: To prove CiF, PL must prove that disclosure to FDA would've reached him, prompting him to not use equipment. THIS IS HARD TO PROVE.

         1.  Original claim: DF failed to warn doctors -- but that would've been pre-empted by MDA.

    iv. **[Cuyler]{.underline}**: Even if duty had been established by statute & DF had been found to have neglected it, PL still must've proved CiF. **Relevant evidence:**

        1.  Show how fast the news spreads in the community/community alert from reporting?

        2.  When reported, not allowed to babysit?

        3.  Cuylers screened potential babysitters by checking database?

e.  **[(EXAM) Big POLICY QUESTION: Should we place more subjectivity on NEGLIGENCE or CAUSATION?]{.mark}**

    i.  Both deal with how much of the circumstances you want the court to bring in.

    ii. Causation is a more fact-sensitive inquiry while negligence involves setting standard of behavior, maybe that's a reason for more consideration of circumstances at CAUSATION analysis.

f.  **[Conflicting aims and causation]{.mark}**

    i.  Justice between parties (cuts both ways)

        1.  Those that cause of actual injury are more morally reprehensible.

        2.  **Counter**: Outcome irrelevant, moral luck, if risk taken both are equally blameworthy.

        3.  **Counter-counter:** If we dispense with causation requirement, the system would be too hard to administer.

    ii. Deterrence -- Communicates to DF in advance scope of liability it will face.

### Multiple Sufficient Causation (MSC)

a.  Multiple acts, each of which would have been sufficient to cause the harm in question. Either tortfeasor's negligence would have been sufficient to be but-for cause of P's harm. (e.g., two fires, separately set, reach house at the same time)

    i.  There is no "but for" cause in this situation bc even if one act did not occur, accident still would've occurred.

    ii. Here, law choses over-imposition of liability (over-inclusion)

    <!-- -->

    a.  **[One negligent, one non-negligent sufficient causes (CLOSE CALL & EXAM Q)]{.mark}**

        i.  Many states **impose liability** on the tortious actor

            1.  **Pros**: Serves deterrence function

        ii. Some states **don't impose liability** on tortious actor

            1.  **Pros**: Unfair to DF bc injury would've happened absent DF's actions.

            2.  **Cons**: Moral luck -- tortious action that does not turn into injury is equally blameworthy, Unfair to make it harder for PL to get relief

        iii. *Under **comparative negligence**, many states reduce the liability of the tortious actor in accordance with the non-tortious cause*

    b.  **[Sequential Causes: Pre-emptive Causation (CLOSE CALL & EXAM Q)]{.mark}**

        i.  First tortious conduct (e.g. fire) causes injury (burns house), then second tortious actor (e.g. second fire) is not liable had the first tortious conduct completely pre-empted the later probable cause.

        ii. **There** is a between when cause is **determined already, internal (e.g. cancer patient is killed by bike) & partially pre-empted** and when **cause has not been determined, external & completely pre-empted (e.g. misses plane that crashes bc some ran into you with bike).**

            1.  **External, not-yet-determined/full pre-emption:** Damages owned are not affected (law of causation).

                a.  If house would've stood on ground 2 min. longer w/o 2^nd^ fire, then damages are 2 minutes of rent.

                    i.  Absurd results: If both fires got there the same time (MSC), then can't you say that both parties are only liable for 0 sec. of rent (ZERO) bc they are burning it at the same time?

            2.  **Internal, already determined/partial pre-emption**: Damages are affected by life expectancy (law of damages)

    c.  **[Strategy: Argue to shift MSC to MNC if you're PL:]{.mark}**

        i.  One cause was actually NOT sufficient (e.g. two sources of fires were actually necessary, not sufficient bc one fire would not have been able to overwhelm the sprinkler).

        ii. DF would attempt to **shift MNC to MSC, then maybe to argue one cause was non-tortious.**

    d.  **[3^rd^ Restatement on "but for" test for MSC]{.mark}**

        i.  **R3T 26 (Factual Cause):**

            1.  **Tortious conduct** must be a factual cause of harm for liability to be imposed. Conduct is a factual cause of harm when the harm would not have occurred absent the conduct. Tortious conduct may also be a factual cause of harm under R3T 27.

        ii. **R3T 27 (Multiple Sufficient Causes):**

            1.  If multiple acts occur, each of which under R3T 26 alone would have been a factual cause of the physical harm at the same time in the absence of the other act(s), each act is regarded as a **factual cause of the harm.**

        iii. Regarding MSC when one SC is non-tortious:

             1.  *R3T assigns CiF & then leaves to the law of damages to sort out who really ends up paying.*

             2.  **R3T 27 Cmt d. One cause tortious, the other innocent**. [This Section applies in a case of MSC, regardless of whether the competing cause involves tortious conduct or consists only of innocent conduct]{.underline}. Conduct is a factual cause of harm regardless of any other cause with which it concurs to produce overdetermined harm. Question of damages is different matter.

### Multiple Necessary Cause (MNC)

a.  Multiple acts are necessary/"but for" causes for the injury; injury would not have occurred absent all acts that are MNCs.

b.  MNC is CiF in CL and R3T 26.

### Joint Tortfeasors

a.  When two parties engage in a joint enterprise, if one is found to be negligent, the two are jointly and severally liable for harm that results.

## Burden of Proof & Information-Forcing Rules

### Alternative liability 

- **[Summers v. Tice (1948)]{.underline}** -- Where there are multiple DFs, either of whom was equally likely to have caused the accident, **[BOP shifts to DF to absolve themselves of liability. They are held jointly and severally liable unless they can show that they are not liable for them.]{.underline}**

  - **Facts**: Two shooters shot PL, one of the bullets hit his eye. PL sues both.

  - **Policy**: Encourages info-sharing (DF have more knowledge about the cause of the harm than the PL)

  - **Other factors to consider when imposing alternative liability**:

    - **Common enterprise** -- the two DFs were hunting, common activity. Nexus, close connection between DFs tends to be a necessity for alt.liability.

    - Rational much weaker when \>2 tortfeasors because then the likelihood that one caused the injury is less with more DFs & info-sharing policy is weaker.

    - When one of the potential causes of the harm is non-tortious, alt.liability should not be imposed. (**[Garcia v. Joseph Vince Co]{.underline}**., 1978)

      - **[Dillon v. Twin State Gas & Electric (1932)]{.underline}** -- If jury found that boy would've been killed by the fall regardless of the electric wire, DF's damages should be reduced.

### [Market share liability]{.mark}

- If market share liability is applicable (see MSL in Harm & Allocation of \$\$), **without [proving individual causation]{.underline}, PL can recover from [each D a portion of damages equal to DF's share of he market for product.]{.underline}**

## Harm & Allocation of \$\$

### [Lost Chance]{.mark}

[**[Matsuyama v. Birnbaum (Mass. 2008)]{.underline} --** PL can recover for loss of chance in a **[medical malpractice claim]{.underline}, where DF's negligence deprived PL of a less than even chance of survival (even if PL initially had less than 50% odds).**]{.mark}

- **Loss-of-chance** is majority rule.

- **Facts:** Doctor's malpractice caused delay in detection of cancer, which deprived cancer patient chance of survival that was already below 50%.

- **Court's move:** Redefine injury; death is not the injury, it's the loss of chance of survival that is the injury done to the PL.

  - [**What if the PL survived? Fennel** thinks recovery is still possible under the doctrine, but Matsuyama seems limited to situations where death actually resulted.]{.mark}

- **Damages:** (Total damages allowed by statute) \* (Survival odds pre-malpractice -- Survival odds post-malpractice)

- **N.B.** Not about BOP -- PL must establish by a preponderance of evidence that DF caused his injury just like in any other negligence context.

- **Significant minority** has **refused to adopt lost chance theory**.

  - **[Fennel v. Southern Maryland Hospital Center (Md. 1990)]{.underline} --** Court denied all recovery to a PL who had shown that the hospital's negligence deprived 40% chance of survival.

a.  Court interpreted loss of chance doctrine dictated some recovery if a DF's negligence reduced a PL's chance of survival from 40% to 10% - **even if patient survived.**

b.  **Concern about the conduct of trials:** stats are unreliable and confuse jury.

c.  **Fairness Concern:** No real difference between patient who had a 49% chance of survival to one that had 51%, but 49% is limited to 49% value of life while 51% is entitled to full recovery for life.

- **[Reasons to limit to medical context & why it shouldn't extend to general risk creation:]{.mark}**

  - [In medical context, there is more hard statistical evidence.]{.mark}

  - [Requires party more capable of preventing harm (doctor) to bear the consequences of his negligence; doctor is the cheapest cost avoider.]{.mark}

**[At the frontier (EXAM!!!!)]{.mark}**

- What if patient had a [genetic condition (non-tortious cause)]{.mark} that also decreased chance of survival along with malpractice?

- **[Survival]{.mark}**: If people were exposed to risk that deprived them of a 30% chance of survival (from 40% to 10%), should DF pay for (1) 30% of the value of lives of those who died or (2) 30% of value of lives of all exposed to the risk?

  - **(2)** would provide full deterrence & gets rid of issue of moral luck, risk creation is just as morally reprehensible regardless of result

  - **(1)** would result in optimal deterrence (bc (2) would be too much deterrence, might affect activity level of socially beneficial conduct -- surgeons)).

- [**Beyond medical context:** What if DF burned PL's lottery ticket, stock certificates?]{.mark}

  - [Courts currently use pain & suffering damages & infliction of emotional distress to deal with this.]{.mark}

  - **[Would loss of chance doctrine be a better alternative?]{.mark}**

### Joint and Several Liability 

Imposed in three main situations:

a.  **Joint Tortfeasors** -- if two people engage in a joint enterprise (e.g. a business partnership) and one is negligent.

b.  When independent tortfeasors' actions results in a **single, theoretically indivisible harm**. (e.g. two negligent parties collide at an intersection, runs on to the sidewalk, injuring pedestrian). Note that these are MNC/"but for" causes.

c.  When independent tortfeasors' actions result in a **single, theoretically divisible, but practically indivisible harm.** *BOP on DF to prove how much damage his action caused, or else, J&S liability.* (e.g. two independent fires reach the house and burn it to ground, alternative liability cases)

**Allocation of \$\$ when one DF is insolvent**

- States have different regimes.

- Modern joint & several in pure comparative negligence regime.

  - **Pros**: Fairness for PL, effective deterrence, depends on if DFs know each other (DF then would be better at suing other DFs)

  - **Cons**: Unfair for first DF to be sued, would depress activity level bc so harsh

- Several liability

  - **Pros**: Bad at risk spreading/reaching deep pockets of DFs, blameworthiness argument depends on culpability of PL, not enough deterrence

  - **Cons**: Avoids unfair situations where first DF only responsible for a bit must pay all and above what he's responsible for & can't find other DFs

- **[BP: What matters to judges in assigning %? DF's are BP, TO, and H.]{.mark}**

  - BP's conduct is the **"but for" cause** of the explosion. TO was just cleaning up BO's mess.

  - **Timing & Info**: BP had more time and info to correct the problem while TO was under time crunch.

  - **Who's in charge**: BP had most authority & control over the situation.

  - Intent/Character of DFs: BP was motivated to save money.

### Market Share

**[Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly & Co. (NY 1989)]{.underline} --** In a product liability cases involving generic drugs where it is impossible to determine which manufacturer produced the drug that harmed the plaintiff, **liability should be apportioned on the basis of a manufacturer's share of the total national market (several liability).**

- The larger the number of wrongdoers, the less probability that one was cause of harm and less likely that DFs info to share (over long decades, they lose the info advantage that they had over PLs)

- Only 1/3 courts have applied market-share liability.

- Always a question of which market is relevant -- national, state, local?

- Finding relevant market data is expensive and difficult. If easy, it cuts in favor for MSL

- Justification: Limiting DF's liability to its market share will, over aggregate, result in liability roughly equal to the harm it actually caused.

- **"Signature disease": The injury could only have been caused by one thing (DF's negligently made drugs);** If you had the injury, 100% certain it was caused by DF's actions.

# Proximate Cause

Even after it is determined that DF is under a duty to exercise reasonable care, and even after PL has proved the other elements of his case, liability isn't imposed unless DF's action also were the "proximate cause" (legal cause) of PL's injury.

Very mushy concept. All the approaches below blend together. Very fact-intensive inquiry.

## Elements of the doctrine

- **Modern Approaches:**

  - Restatement (Third) Approach: **SCOPE OF LIABILITY**

    - **R3T 36 Trivial Contributions to Multiple Sufficient Causes**

      - When an actor's negligent conduct constitutes only a trivial contribution to a causal set that is a factual cause of harm under **R3T 27**, the **harm is not within the scope of the actor's liability.**

        - **"Harriet's case"** -- one girl among a 7 male car-tippers: Any four of 8 of the car-tippers required to tip car over. **Anyone necessary to a possible sufficient cause has created CiF**, including Harriet. R3T 36 & proximate cause designed to exclude Harriet.

  - **HARM-WITHIN-THE-RISK TEST:** DF's negligence was not the proximate cause of PL's injury if risk of injury PL suffered was not the risk that made DF negligent.

    - [Harm-within-the-**foreseeable increased risk ([Palsgraff]{.underline}) --** see below chart for results of the type of unforeseeability.]{.mark}

    - **R3T 29 Limitations on Liability for Tortious Conduct**

      - An actor's liability is limited to those harms that result from the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious.

- **Traditional:**

  - **FORESEEABILITY:** DF's negligence is proximate cause of PL's harm if causing that harm was a foreseeable result of DF's conduct.

  - **INDIRECT v. DIRECT CAUSE:** Is there an intervening/superseding cause?

### Policy for/against proximate cause

- **Pros:** Normatively don't want negligent persons to have to pay for distant harms, Deterrence is not served bc unforeseen harms can't be deterred, impossible to administer a system where any cause is allowed to become a source of liability (we need to break the chain at some point)

- **Cons:** Important aim of tort law is compensation (negligent + injury should lead to compensation), moral luck -- there is no difference between tortfeasors who do same thing but only one results in harm.

- **"Proximate cause" is a test for negligence.**

## Cases

**[In Re Polemis (UK 1921)]{.underline} -** A **negligent** tortfeasor **will** be held liable for **unforeseeable damages (type of harm).**

- **Facts**: Freak accident of falling log caused by negligence, which sets off an explosion of ship.

**[The Wagon Mound (UK 1961)]{.underline} --** Liability for damages is based on reasonable foreseeability of the outcome. **A negligent defendant won't be responsible for consequences not reasonably foreseeable.**

- **Facts**: Ship leaked oil/gunk into harbor, which caught on fire & harbor burned down.

[**[Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co. (NY 1928)]{.mark}**]{.underline}

- ***Cardozo majority*** -- (1) An act is negligent only to foreseeable victims within zone of danger, (2) Tort exists between tortfeasor & the victim (no negligence in the air except in strict liability or statutory violation), [(3) **How to limit liability**: No negligence (breach of duty -- say there is no duty). Here, railroad company didn't have duty to Mrs.Palsgraf]{.underline}

  - If we talk about Palsgraf as a case about PC (Andrews), when it comes to [unexpected PL]{.underline}, MAJORITY RULE NOW

- ***Andrews dissent*** -- (1) Where an act unreasonably threatens safety of others (negligence), the actor is liable to consequences even outside the reasonably foreseeable danger zone, (2) Duty to take reasonable care is owed to the entire world. [(3) **Hot to limit liability**: Proximate cause (line drawing tool -- where we arbitrarily cut off liability considering policy, politics, etc.) (MAJORITY RULE NOW)]{.underline}

- Posner on Palsgraf: Liability is very sensitive to facts.

BP: Settled on how PC should be proved in a way that was hugely generous to the PL.

**[Davis v. U.S. (2012)]{.underline}** -- FBI shields two felons from the law so they could continue to use them as informants. They end up killing two women & the women's family sue under FTCA.

- "but for" causation is a non issue.

- Question is: were the deaths of these women foreseeable?

  - Government: Can't have foreseen that these women specifically would've been killed, could've foreseen murder for business reasons, but not for personal.

  - **PL/Court: It was foreseeable that the two felons would murder someone, don't have to prove that it was specifically these victims.**

# INTENTIONAL TORTS: Willful Misconduct and Gross Negligence

##  BP Oil Spill: When ordinary negligence becomes gross negligence and willful misconduct (intentional torts)

**Basic Facts of BP Oil Spill:**

- On April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon, a state-of-the-art, offshore oilrig operated by BP in the Gulf of Mexico exploded. Blast killed 11 crew members. Then Deepwater Horizon sank, causing the LARGEST offshore oil spill in American history.

- During trial, oil-drilling expert testified that the rig's crew misinterpreted results of the negative pressure tests done the day of the explosion. U.S. contends that the botched test led to the blast.

  - Handling of the check "was a gross and extreme departure" from accepted standards in the oil industry

  - "Bladder effect": condition occurs when pressure on valves may produce false readings -- BP & Transocean content the rig's crew accepted the anomalous test results because of this. Experts agree this can't be an acceptable excuse.

- Government and spill victims say BP was over budget and behind schedule, prompting the company to cut corners and ignore safety tests showing the well was unstable.

- BP sued contractors (e.g. Transocean employees -- disabled safety system, failed to maintain the installation properly, Halliburton -- provided shoddy cement materials)

**Legal Issue:**

- Are BP, Haliburton, and Transocean guilty of gross negligence and/or willful misconduct?

- What's at stake is Clean Water Act (CWA)'s penalty, which quadruples the amount of damages if **GN OR WM** are found.

- GN and WN are not defined by CWA, so court must look to tort law (common law)

**Gross Negligence:**

- U.S.: GN is just really bad negligence (objective element), something far less than ordinary care.

- BP: GN requires finding of recklessness (subjective element) -- which is a culpable mental state -- along with negligence (objective element) that far less than ordinary care.

- **Judge Barbier:** (1) Agrees with U.S. (Objective standard of a reasonable company man under the circumstances.) (2) Even if we use BP's standard, still guilty of GN because the facts make you look so bad/imply culpable mental state & even if we use WN standard that requires subjective element as well:

a)  Inherently dangerous activity (foreseeable that risks were high so they knew the dangers) -- subjective

b)  Guy in Houston told the operator that something was wrong with negative pressure test, but operator continued without stopping & Houston didn't pursuit the matter further. -- subjective

c)  Bladder effect excuse: (1) could go to mental state because it's a BS excuse (2) could be objective bc no one would've misread test results due to this.

d)  Area drilling had been difficult -- objective bc a reasonable company person would've taken more precautions then due to the foreseeable risks of the area.

e)  Untaken precautions/BPL analysis: Burden was so low for untaken precautions like the Sheen test that required operator's approval after the negative pressure test (he could've just not approved & accident would've been prevented). -- objective

f)  Motivated by money!! -- subjective

- BP's counters:

  - Subjective info can be used to support BP:

    - The two employees were nice, responsible people.

**Willful Misconduct:**

- U.S. & BP agree: Some subjective element is required.

- Court: Only need GN OR WM, but see above for why facts show that BP is guilty of both WM and BP's standard of GN.

## TRESPASS

A.  **INTENTIONAL TRESPASS**: *see above chart & **Martin**.*

B.  **UNINTENTIONAL TRESPASS:** If DF lacks any reasonable awareness that the interference is happening (so no intention to even enter the land, let alone intention to trespass) then **the negligence standard applies instead of trespass (which is kind of like SL)** e.g. if the ship ends up at someone's dock without even meaning to be there.

    a.  [[There must be harm to be liable]{.underline}]{.mark}

    b.  Subject to regular negligence analysis

C.  **CONVERSION (*Kreman*) is SL tort!** **Elements**:

    i.  [Ownership/right of possession]{.mark}

    ii. [Wrongful dispossession/dominion]{.mark}

    iii. [Damages]{.mark}

    <!-- -->

    a.  **[TRESPASS TO CHATTEL is the "little brother of conversion" - *Intel*]{.mark}**

        i.  Must show **actual damages**. DF liable for **normal damages, not full value.**

        ii. If there is trivial interference, there is no trespass to chattels, and no damages.

        iii. **[Trespass to chattels turns into [conversion]{.underline}]{.mark}** when the interference is so serious as to warrant the tortfeasor pay the **market value of the property**: a verdict for the PL in a conversion is effectively a [**forced sale of the damaged chattel** to the DF **+** **extra damages**]{.underline} e.g. if DF sells stolen goods to 3^rd^ party, DF will pay full value under conversion

             1.  [OR **replevin** (if chattel isn't damaged)]{.underline}

             2.  From a spectrum of little interference to lots of interference that amount to dispossession, there is a line between trespass to chattels and conversion.

D.  **DEFENSES TO TRESPASS: NECESSITY EXCEPTIONS**

    a.  Public Exception: [absolute defense]{.underline}

        i.  When interference with PL's property right is reasonable in light of sufficiently significant risk to a large group of people (for instance, one house can be torn down to prevent the spread of fire to the rest of town)

        ii. PL cannot recover for ANY damages for the result. Would have been destroyed anyway. Hard to know which parties to hold responsible.

    b.  **[Private Exception: [conditional defense]{.underline} ]{.mark}**

        i.  When interference with PL's property right is reasonable in light of a sufficiently significant risk to a single person or property, see below for results

        ii. Conditional defense bc user must pay damages whether or not use was reasonable if owner let him stay.

        iii. **[[Reasonable Versus Unreasonable]{.underline}]{.mark}:**

             1.  Looks like **SL for the trespasser**, but **negligence regime** for owner.

             2.  It matters whether or not we call it trespass bc it determines whether owner has to pay if they employ self-help & eject.

+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+

3.  Court maybe making a determination that ship-owner is the CCA, but possible to argue that dock-owner was the CCA (they know the area well & better position to work things out before hand bc they know the risks of that area -- perhaps they paid a cheaper price for the dock bc it was open for use by ship-owners in emergencies).

    a.  [Or is court adhering to only negligence standard for property owners bc there is something built into property law that favors owners for non-utilitarian reasons (personhood interests)?]{.mark}

4.  Deterrence/utilitarian argument: threatening user with liability gives the party incentive to compare the cost of liability with cost of alternatives that might avoid liability (e.g. if user had no liability, then they'd just use the property) -- liability internalizes externalities of the harm to the owner of the property.

iv. *Vincent* involved an emergency situation between strangers -- bargaining difficult.

v.  [In *Ploof*, owner had a pre-existing relation (K relation, so already engaged in bargaining), so here, bargaining is more possible. Coase theory more relevant here, and whoever has more info (CCA v.1) and better position to initiate bargain (CCA v. 2) should be held liable.]{.mark}

## CASES For TRESPASS & CONVERSION 

**TRESPASS- [Martin]{.underline}: parties case.** Case **argued as trespass when it could have been nuisance** [due to statute of limitations]{.underline}. Reasonable awareness that these particles could harm the property so held liable. Softened the classic edges of trespass law.

A.  [New age of trespass intention: **[awareness can indicate intent]{.underline}**. You do not have to intend to enter the land, just reasonable awareness that the particles will enter the land]{.mark} (negligence-ish on entry element)

B.  Particles and energy constitute entrance upon land and can do harm.

C.  Exclusive possession became ***feeling* and *dignity* of exclusive possession**, NOT the fact of it or the physical nature of it. **The harm in this sense is the feeling**. The question is even if there is trespass, was the feeling of possession interfered? If not, no trespass? This remains unclear 🡪 sets a higher standard for liability at the same time.

    i.  The link between liability and the "feeling" element of harm perhaps balances the loosened definition of intent.

**CONVERSION NOT EXTENDED- [Moore]{.underline}: spleen cell case.** Doctor took patient's spleens and used it for research without consent & made profits after developing products out of the cell from spleens. P sues for conversion because his genetic material = his property. Court holds he *disposed of it* and the value of the product has nothing to do with him + no right to the profits of the research.

A.  Science and progress policy concerns trump "rights" asserted. [[He disposed of it -- so not conversion.]{.underline}]{.mark} Was not his property at that point and the benefits of the research were not his or stolen from him. Because conversion is SL, everyone along the chain is potentially liable if conversion is extended here & therefore, would lead to undue burden in scientific progress.

    a.  **Counter**: Court could have made conversion a negligent crime as applied in these cases or made it based on knowledge (which would protect bona fide purchasers).

    b.  **Mosk dissent**: Just cut off liability at the first chain.

B.  Institutional competence: extension of conversion should be legislature's role.

    a.  **Counter**: CL is evolved by courts all the time (*Tarasoff*)

C.  Conversion is not necessary to protect patient's rights bc doctors are under duty to obtain informed consent, there are found negligent bc failure to warn.

    a.  **Mosk dissent**: Informed consent does not suffice bc it doesn't allow PL to say, "yes, take my spleen, but I want \$\$."

        i.  [**Counter**: You can **contract around the law**: "I won't consent unless you give me 50%." You don't need conversion to do this.]{.mark}

**CONVERSION EXTENDED- [Kreman (sex.com)]{.underline} case:** PL's domain name is taken from him under false pretense & PL sues domain company for having sold under conversion. Court looks at [[whether there is an interest capable of precise definition (well defined interest/worth/title).]{.underline} Must be capable of exclusive possession or control,]{.mark} putative owner must have legitimate exclusive possession. Tradition: can't convert intangible properties. **Court rules that intangibles are properties and can be converted such as domains.**

**TRESSPASS OF CHATTEL NOT EXTENDED- [Intel]{.underline} Case:** [trespass of chattels requires harm and damages unlike trespass on land.]{.underline} What is the chattel in this case? Emails? Server? Cannot prove actual harm because all DF did was send emails (severs were created for the purpose of receiving emails), not virus or harm, **so servers (court goes with servers as chattel) were not adversely affected**. Court's policy concern: if trespass to chattels allowed here, there would be endless liability for content transmitted electronically -- e.g. radio, TV, etc.

- **[PL could've re-scoped the chattel -- e.g. employee's time.]{.mark}**

- **[Meta lesson: definition of "chattel" is clearly tied to "injury"]{.mark}**

- Also [no trespass to land]{.underline} despite P's argument that servers are "land" ("cyber-space") and do not need harm.

  - Counter: Use *Martin* move to say (1) emails are packets of data entering cyber space, or (2) feelings of ownership of mailboxes have been invaded.

## NUISANCE

A.  **Differences from Trespass**: nuisance stems from the concept of *intrusion* that prevents the enjoyment of one's land; not about physical entry, it's the invasion of the right to use property/interference with possession.

    a.  [**Harm** is needed (*usage of property is harmed*). **Intention**: not about whether one intends to impose nuisance on the other. In that sense -- intention is not required]{.mark}

        i.  [Intention is about the **knowledge that actions might do harm (harm that interfered individual's enjoyment of his land)**, not the intent of doing harm]{.mark}

B.  [Intentional Private Nuisance (R2T)]{.underline}

    a.  Requires both *intention* AND *reasonableness* 🡪 [[reasonableness of the interference or the nuisance and NOT about the reasonableness of the actor]{.mark}]{.underline}

    b.  **[[Unreasonableness]{.underline} of the Interference Test: Balance the Equities]{.mark}**

        i.  **826(a): *Gravity* of the harm outweighs the *utility* of the actor's conduct. (BPL)**

            1.  **§ 827 Gravity Of Harm -- Factors Involved**:

                a.  The extent of the harm involved;

                b.  The character of the harm involved;

                c.  The social value that the law attaches to the type of use or enjoyment invaded;

                d.  The suitability of the particular use or enjoyment invaded to the character of the locality; and

                e.  Burden on the person harmed of avoiding the harm

            2.  **§ 828 Utility Of Conduct -- Factors Involved**:

                a.  The social value that the law attaches to the primary purpose of the conduct;

                b.  Suitability of conduct to character of the locality

                c.  Impracticability of preventing/avoiding the invasion

        ii. **OR** 826(b): *Harm* caused by the conduct is serious and the financial burden of compensating for this and similar harm to others would not make the continuation of the conduct feasible. **[(Addresses situations where harm is bad, but benefits are even larger -- so nuisance maker can feasibly pay off property owner.)]{.mark}**

        iii. 829A: Gravity of invasion outweighs its utility whenever the harm caused is **both substantial and greater than PL should be required to bear w/o compensation.**

             1.  Can bring in evidence about anything (explicit equity trump card)

             2.  Makes Coase irrelevant? Escape hatch from utilitarian analysis of finding the CCA?

C.  [Unintentional Private Nuisance (R2T)]{.underline}

    a.  Similar to trespass, one can be liable for unintentional nuisance 🡪 must be [otherwise actionable under the rules governing liability for negligent, reckless OR]{.mark} abnormally dangerous conditions and activities. Also required that **injury be related to an invasion of interest in the use/enjoyment of land.**

## REMEDIES FOR NUISANCE

A.  Types of Remedies:

    a.  **Injunctions (Property Rule)** -- D must stop its activities and the nuisance.

    b.  **Damages (Liability Rule)** -- D pays P for all past and future losses but could be permitted to continue the activity

    c.  D**amage + Injunction** -- D may have to pay the plaintiff for damages for all past losses and also be enjoined from continuing the nuisance thereafter

B.  [Courts balance the equities at the liability stage to determine whether D has engaged in nuisance. But also at the remedial stage in determining appropriate remedies:]{.mark}

    a.  Whether to enjoin (plus past harm perhaps) the DF, OR

    b.  Permit the activity and hold DF liable for damages for past and future harm

C.  **[Factors for deciding nuisance remedies]{.mark}**

    a.  Parties' respective faults

    b.  Hardship to the parties in respect to continuance or discontinuance of the nuisance

    c.  Value of the activity that constitutes the nuisance to the surrounding community

        i.  Usually in tort law, injury has already happened & ceased, so remedy of liabilities is appropriate, but for nuisance, the injury is often continuing so injunction is also available.

D.  **Choosing between Property Rules and Liability Rules -- Calabresi**

    a.  Some considerations:

        i.  **[The possibility of bargaining:]{.mark}**

            1.  **[Good possibility (small parties, relationship): property rules (box 1 & 3) bc parties can bargain and reach better]{.mark}**

            2.  **[Bad possibility (big parties, bilateral monopoly, strangers): liability rules (box 2 &4) bc less likely parties will bargain with each other.]{.mark}**

        ii. Existence or measurement of damages:

            1.  When damages don't exist or can't be measured, then liability rules may be ineffective.

        iii. Administrative costs

             1.  Liability rules require the system to measure damages and that may be costly.

             2.  Property rules don't involve these costs -- evidence of extent of damages, evaluated by fact finder, etc.

                 a.  If you think courts are bad at figuring out damages, perhaps we should go with liability rules.

        iv. (non-Calabresi) Fairness factors & concerns about CCA

            1.  Going vertically is animated by other aims of tort law like distribution, fairness and other conceptions of CCA.

E.  [The Table below demonstrates that Courts determine who gets to decide and who has the bargaining power via LIABLITY and DAMAGES v. INJUNCTION. No liability on DF means an injunction on PL. Think about the institutional competence of courts to do this.]{.mark}

F.  **Mistakes & Institutional Competance**

- If court gets **damages too high (liability rules)**, then it functions as an injunction.

  - Parties can still bargain.

- If court gets **damages too low (liability rules)**, then it functions like no liability, but parties can still bargain & work it out (PL can offer to pay more to stop DF -- Box 4).

  - Here, if bargaining won't work (conditions are bad for bargaining), court should be extra concerned about getting damages right.

- If court gets inj**unction wrong** (how do you determine this? can courts determine the social value of something v. harm to owner, etc.?), parties can still bargain it out, but since PL & DF can demand a lot of money, may lead to strategic holdouts, etc.

- Meta point: Even if court's mistake doesn't foreclose bargaining for more efficient outcome (Coase), (1) Coase's assumptions/limits apply (conditions for bargaining), and (2) ignores other aims of tort law such as distribution effects, bargaining power, etc.

  - **Argument that parties are better able to work it out**: Since parties can work out more accurate numbers, court's role is to facilitate bargaining and ensure fairness of distribution -- so getting it right in terms of fairness values is important.

## 

## CASES for NUISANCE

**[Bloomer v. Atlantic Cement]{.underline}:** PLs sue DF for nuisance. PLs are neighboring landowners suing DF for dirt and smoke violation. Court grants injunction but [conditional]{.underline}: injunction unless DF compensates PLs for current (past) and future losses.

a.  Court gives this conditional grant because DF's activities are NOT *entirely* unreasonable -- creates resources (cement) and jobs. Court doesn't want the factory to shut down. [[**Dissent** argues should have been true injunction because *entirely* unreasonable and no utilitarian societal benefit & **should've used law to push technology (grant injunction but postpone it, incentivizing DF to invent technology to lessen pollution).**]{.underline} ]{.mark}

    i.  **Court's response to dissent**: Not sure if tech will advance esp. if the problem is this difficult.

    ii. **Counter**: What if there is room for more precautions? What box enables this precaution to be taken? What if court gets damages wrong?

b.  [There are multiple parties here, so bargaining looks difficult (holdouts, each parties' subjective values, etc.)]{.mark}

c.  [[When weighing what to do for nuisance, think about the utilities D's activities provide to society and balance that against the harm]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[Spurs v. Del Webb]{.underline}**: PL found to have come to the nuisance bc he moves in a place where there is a cement plant & sues for nuisance due to the pollution. Court rules that PL may enforce his property right (get injunction), but must indemnify DF for the cost of moving or shutting down set by court.

- **Justification**: PL could have foreseen this nuisance & probably paid less money for his land, cement plant was socially valuable.

- **Counter**: A rule that the first party to make an active use of property gets the right to do so w/o fear of liability in nuisance would encourage a race to make active use of land even if such use was otherwise premature 🡺 undesirable development race, bad for environment.

# Remedies

**[PURPOSE OF REMEDIES]{.underline}**

A.  **Compensation**: achieving justice or providing civil recourse by compensating the PL for losses resulting from DF's tortious act

B.  **Deterrence**: promoting deterrence via threatening DFs with liability with the costs resulting from their tortious acts

C.  **Redistribution & Accountability**: recognizing the social and individual significance of PL's loss and confirming the weight of DF's responsibility for that loss, redistributing money to balance out the scales

D.  **Ps receive SINGLE RECOVERY**: compensation for both past and future harm

    a.  Appellate court can review and overturn the damages if the award *shocks the conscious*

E.  *Types of Remedies*

    a.  Damages (law): compensatory, nominal, punitive

    b.  Injunction (equity): preliminary, permanent

A.  FACTORS For Granting Injunction in General: injunctions are an *equitable remedy* therefore the judge uses his discretion to decide, not jury, using these general factors:

    a.  Parties' respective fault(s)

    b.  Hardship the parties will face, respectively, after the continuance or discontinuance of the activity

    c.  Value of the nuisance activity to the surrounding community

B.  **[FACTORS For Granting Permanent Injunction (*e-Bay*)]{.mark}**

    a.  **[P has suffered an irreparable injury]{.mark}**

    b.  **[Remedies available at law are inadequate to compensate for the injury]{.mark}**

    c.  **[Considering the balance of hardships between P and D, an equitable remedy is]{.mark}**

    d.  **[Public interest will not be disserved by the permanent injunction]{.mark}**

        i.  [1 cannot mean what it says (injunctions prevent continuing harms)]{.mark}

        ii. [1&2 are basically the same thing]{.mark}

        iii. [3&4 means to think about the effect on EVERYONE!]{.mark}

C.  Rule is: Right != Remedy, could argue to Kennedy that times haven't changed (so grant injunction for right!). *Outcome of case: Ebay settled & bought the patent from MercExchange.*

D.  Concerns About Such Tests

    a.  There's not bite to the tests. It's just a tool for judges to make up an excuse after they decide to grant injunctions or not depending on personal preference.

    b.  **Relevance of existing market for the patent? [May cut in favor or disfavor of bargaining being possible.]{.underline}**

        i.  Then price of patent will be easy to figure out -- so no risk of getting damages right. Should go for money damages.

            1.  Counter: Ebay is different from other uses of patent existing in the market bc their scope is so big/stand to make much more. Hard to price this, so grant injunction so parties can figure it out better.

            2.  Counter-counter: Then patent trolls will take advantage & charge huge \$\$.

        ii. Public interest isn't harmed if patent troll gets permanent injunction/Ebay loses the patent bc it's already on the market for people to use.

        iii. **Bargaining already failed!!** So it's extra-important courts get it right since the parties can't fix it for the most economic outcome. Therefore the question is, are courts better at granting damages or injunctions? What are the incentives created by those?

    c.  **[Arguments for injunction since bargaining failed (and court's intervention needed for bargaining):]{.mark}**

        i.  [Injunction would force bargaining]{.mark}

        ii. [Serves deterrence function to future patent violators, punishment for Ebay.]{.mark}

        iii. [There will be race to be first to patent, which leads to social good.]{.mark}

        iv. [Ginsburg: A damage would amount to forced sale when MercExchanged refused to buy in the first place. Unfair. Scalia: Therefore, let's leave it to market.]{.mark}

    d.  [**However, if you think bargaining will work bc existence of market** (don't need court to force them to bargain), then perhaps money damages seem more appealing bc court can worry about other aims of tort law like distributional effects, fairness factors, etc.]{.mark}

    e.  [**[Western Radio]{.underline}** fails to adhere to Ebay court's holding & grants injunction. Or maybe there is something different about the tower & real property.]{.mark}

## COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

A.  Policy Considerations

    a.  **Goal**: make the plaintiff whole & restore the plaintiff to the position before the accident

    b.  Functions to satisfy aims of tort law: (1) achieve corrective justice & provide civil recourse, (2) promote deterrence by threatening DFs with liability, (3) recognizes social & individual significance of PF's loss & confirming the weight of the DF's responsibilities for the loss.

<!-- -->

1.  **Mechanism -- two types of compensatory Ds: (1) pecuniary (medical expenses, lost wages) and (2) non-pecuniary (pain & suffering)**

    a.  In ordinary cases, PF gets a **single (untaxed) recovery**, providing compensation not only for past but also future losses, if any.

        i.  **Pros**: (1) Closure -- PL has incentive to recovery as soon as possible after & get on with life, repose for DF & can plan for economic future w/o uncertainty of being liable to PL again. (2) Efficiency for legal system -- avoidance of multiple suits & their costs

        ii. **Cons**: (1) inaccurate (e.g. prediction of how injured PL will be in future, lost future earnings, how much & far into the future pain & suffering will continue, etc.) (2) PL must be a good investor or she will not have the award when she really needs it in the future bc award is discounted to present value (i.e. reduced to a sum which, if invested, will equal the amount of the future loss at the time it occurs.)

        iii. Recovery is virtually never permitted today for damages resulting from even a reasonable fear that one will suffer harm in the future; liability for future loss must await the actual occurrence of present physical injury.

    b.  **Pain and Suffering Awards**

        i.  **Function:** (1) acknowledges intangible losses from pain & suffering (compensation for just out-of-pocket expenses would rarely make the PL "whole"), (2) can use money for alternative enjoyments to compensate for what was taken away (e.g. can't use legs to play soccer, buy an awesome TV to watch soccer), (3) optimal deterrence (here, it doesn't matter to who DF pays, he just has to pay), (4) payment for attorneys (many tort suits are paid via contingent-fee arrangement)

            1.  **Regarding deterrence in contract settings** (e.g. medical malpractice or products liability): If people aren't willing to pay higher fee as insurance for P&S, then P&S damages shouldn't be awarded. COUNTER: Rational to assume that people want to purchase P&S insurance and tort law is more than just an insurance system.

        ii. **Limitations on Awards:** (1) remittitur & additur (2) absolute dollar ceiling (3) "schedule" of P&S awards like workers comp

        iii. **Pain and Suffering for Property Damage:** Black-letter limitation on recovery of P&S damages for property damages may be weakening (e.g. State statutes for deaths of pets).

        iv. See *Seffert* below

### Judicial Review of Damages

**[Seffert v. Los Angeles Transit Lines]{.underline} --** [An appellate court should only interfere with the measure of damages awarded if it is so excessive that it shocks the conscience and suggests passion, prejudice or corruption on jury's part. Here, it was not exceesive.]{.mark}

- **Facts**: Lady gets dragged by bus & suffers huge injuries that require very painful surgeries & can't walk & in perpetual pain. Trial jury awards pain & suffering damages in addition to pecuniary damages (medical expenses, lost future wages, etc.). DF appeals arguing p&s damages were excessive.

- Trial judges generally are afforded wide deference in their judgment with respect to the adequacy, fairness of the damages.

  - Trial judge sees and hears the witnesses, injury and impairment firsthand; they can weigh the evidence and judge the credibility of witnesses.

- **Traynor Dissent:** Courts should strive for consistency & predictability for pain and suffering damages; should avoid wild fluctuations in damages awarded for pain and suffering. Suggests a fixed ration for non-economic (pain and suffering, etc.) versus economic damages: should not exceed 1:1.

### Judicial Review of Injunctions

**[e360 v. Spamhaus]{.underline}** -- DC Judge enters default judgment bc Spamhaus (DF) failed to defend, so in determining remedies, Judge depends only on PL's data (DF provided none). District judge gave damages and injunction. Appellate:

- **Damages**: not reasonable certain, so go back & get more data on damages

- **Injunction**: district court gave no explanation, so go back & give explanation. Also requirement that Spamhaus not list e360 unless there is clear & convincing evidence that it broke U.S. law is not tailored bc there's no reasonable relationship with liability, which involves violating ISP terms of use.

## "NO DUTY" AND LIMITS ON EMOTIONAL & ECONOMIC LOSSES

Limits of tort law: **CL no recovery for "pure" emotional loss or "pure" economic loss (where liability is limited by no duty)**

- [Food for though: are public utilities companies too big to sue?]{.mark}

### Pure Emotional Losses

- Default CL rule is **[no liability (no duty)]{.underline}, hence no recovery for pure emotional distress.**

  - Unless there was some physical injury or PL was in "zone of danger" of physical injury, PL cannot recover for negligently inflicted emotional distress (NIED)

  - **Policy**: too great an opportunity for fraud, floodgates of litigation would open, remedying NIED in tort suits is just beyond what we want to law to devote its limited energies & resources to.

### Pure Economic Losses

- Default CL rule is **[no liability (no duty)]{.underline}, hence no recovery for pure economic loss.**

**[Strauss v. Belle (NY 1985)]{.underline}** -- Electric company's gross negligence resulted in blackout and a noncustomer PL was injured in dark.

- **Holding**: In the case of a blackout of a metropolis of several million residents and visitors, **[liability for injuries in a building's common area should, as a matter of [public policy]{.underline}, be limited by the [contractual relationship]{.underline}.]{.mark} NO DUTY!**

  - At trial, question went to jury, but judge makes a no duty call as a matter of law.

  - Note similarity to Andrews dissent in **[Palsgraff]{.underline}**.

- **Policy**: Allowing recovering here would violate the court's responsibility to define an orbit of duty that places controllable limits on liability. **Huang: Very realist, arbitrary line-drawing.**

  - **[Judge was worried about burdening a public utilities company (as in [Moch]{.underline}) too much (they may go out of business & everyone will be deprived of the benefit of important services), but Huang asks, why not make them suffer, perhaps they will really feel the pain & change their ways.]{.mark}**

- **Dissent**: [(1) Perverse that court is saying basically that the more persons injured through **gross negligence**, the less the responsibility for injuries incurred. (how is this supporting public policy?) 🡺 **TO BIG TO SUE!**]{.mark} **(**2) No basis on majority assumption that impact of a city-wide deprivation of electric power upon the utility is entitled to greater consideration than the impact upon those injured.

**[532 Madision Ave. v. Finlandia]{.underline} --** courts have never that a landowner owes a duty to protect an entire urban neighborhood **against purely economic losses.**

- **NJ rule (People Express Airlines):** extent of liability and degree of foreseeability stand in direct proportion to one another.

- **Another example of arbitrary line-drawing based on public policy.**

[**Bishop's justification for no recovery for pure economic losses**: Many economic loss situations involve **no net social costs**. Although these situations involve **private costs to the victims**, the net effect is a **mere redistribution of wealth with no consequent loss to society**.]{.mark}

**Other rationales:**

- **Loss-distributing:** Economic losses resulting from negligently caused bodily injuries/property damage are distributed among *large numbers of people*. Loss-distribution rationale for imposing liability on injurer is weak given *already-existing broad loss distribution*.

- **Deterrence:** No deterrence shortfall, since there would be liability for bodily injury/property damage.

**[[\*OVERRIDING QUESTION FOR PD: Should PD be based on harm? Why, how, whose?]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### 

### 

### 

### [CRITERIA FOR USING PD]{.mark}

a.  Outrageous, heinous, callous, reprehensible

b.  Gross negligence, willful, wanton recklessness

c.  Profit-oriented

    i.  Question: Why don't we impose PD for negligence? Wouldn't that deter DF more? Why do PLs for negligent harm get less protection?

        1.  Speaks to DF-focus of PDs?

### [PUNITIVE DAMAGES CASES]{.mark}

**[State Farm v. Campbell (Kennedy 2003)]{.underline}** -- SF convinced accident-causer to refuse settlement bc their policy to save \$\$, ended up screwing over the accident-causer.

- Jury awarded such a huge PD bc SF's nation-wide practice of profit-making that was bad for insurance-holders, causing them to be harmed in all kinds of ways.

- [**Court**: Utah SC can't assign PD this way (overstepping jurisdictional boundaries) bc (1) SF's acts may not be illegal in other state, and (2) PD is beyond the harm suffered by this PL (**PM holding**)]{.underline}

- **Holding**: Single-digit multiplier is constitutionally appropriate.

**[Phillip Morris v. Williams (Breyer 2007)]{.underline}** -- Cig company made false advertisements saying cigs aren't bad for you & it ended up killing a guy who smoked too much of them.

- Trial court refuses jury instructions from PM that it couldn't punish OM for injury to non-PLs

  - Jury grants PD roughly 100x CD.

  - SCOTUS & Oregon SC play tennis w/ case.

- SCOTUS: Does not address the question everyone is wondering about -- is 100x too much? -- and resolve the case on issue about harm to non-parties/missing PLs.

  - Breyer really objected to Exxon's 1:1, in general is a standards-guy, so not surprising.

- **Holding**: Can't punish for other PLs not part of litigation, but can take into account in determining reprehensibility. **[Trial judge should be extra careful in jury instructions to make sure jury understands or put in some procedural mechanisms (e.g. bifurcated & different juries).]{.mark}**

  - Counter: Bring it in as evidence to show reasonability of PL (refute contributory negligence defense)? **[Argue in terms of deterrence, bc then you need to talk about the missing PLs for effective deterrence?]{.mark}**

  - **Stevens dissent**: Distinction made by court is fake, just let jury take harm to missing PLs in PD calculation.

    - **Counter**: Would lead to double PD if those missing PLs decided to sue.

- After trial:

  - When SCOTUS remanded, Oregon SC refuses to run another trial bc PM's jury instructions were wrong on other grounds, therefore it wasn't wrong for the trial judge to refuse it. By resolving the issue on a technical, state-law issue, Oregon SC takes away SCOTUS authority to review case.

  - **PM paid the PD, but 60% of it ended up in Oregon state.**

    - Good: If you focus on DF regarding PD (punishment, deterrence), this is okay.

    - Bad: If you focus on PL, not okay bc they don't get all the money.

    - **25% goes to lawyers, 15% to PL's estate.**

**[Exxon v. Baker (Souter 2008)]{.underline}** -- 19 years after accident where an alcoholic captain left deck, leading to crash & oil spill in Alaska.

- **19 years** 🡺 **speaks to how long the judicial process takes. That's why a private or government fund might be better (BP, 9/11)?**

- Baker PLs are fishermen, native Alaskan (about 32,000 people) who didn't settle (most settled including government & already got money, but not PDs). Made into a **mandatory punitive class** (weird, works to get PDs to bind all future PLs & gives peace to Exxon)

  - Therefore, there are no missing PLs here. How does this cut?

- SCOTUS sends it down, 9^th^ circuit upholds, back & forth. Jury awarded PD of 5 billion for Exxon, 5,000 for captain. Reduced by 9^th^ to 2.5 billion.

- Three questions: (1) Shipowner's "derivative liability" -- see VICARIOUS LIABILITY (2) pre-emption by CWA -- see FEDERAL PRE-EMPTION **[[(3) Is 2.5 billion too big under maritime law? NOT a constitutional problem, but one of policy - what is federal CL going to look like?]{.underline}]{.mark}**

- **Holding for (3):** 1:1 ratio for CD:PD for maritime law. Maybe larger ratio for recklessness.

### [LIMITING FACTORS FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES]{.mark} 

a.  Purpose of Limitations: do not want to over-deter and over-punish: compensatory damages might be punitive. These are **how the reviewing court restrains jury-given PD.**

b.  [**[Exxon (Souter 2008), State Farm (Kennedy 2003), Phillip Morris (Breyer 2007)]{.mark}**]{.underline} courts discusses three limits & add to doctrine

    i.  **[SF & PM addresses constitutional issues]{.underline}**

        1.  Due process: notice of severity is required for DF's constitutional rights.

c.  **[[Caps (exist in state, federal statutes):]{.underline}]{.mark}**

    i.  Pros: easier application (administrative purpose). Easier for juries.

    ii. Cons: fact-finders might not be able to or willing to adjust for variance in actual damage (DF will prefer this when CD is high). Legislatures can better apply caps as they can revisit the amount at will and adjust for inflation. Judges cannot choose their docket & are bound by precedent, so harder to adjust caps for PD (this logic also applies to hard multipliers).

d.  **[[Ratio/Multipliers (exist in state, federal -- CWA):]{.underline}]{.mark}**

    i.  **[Exxon]{.underline}: ratio of PD:CD shouldn't exceed 1:1 for [federal maritime cases]{.underline} (federal CL).**

    ii. **[[State Farm]{.underline}: must not take D's dissimilar acts into PD, can't overstep jurisdictional boundaries. Sets [constitutional constraints/standard for judges]{.underline} via single digit multiplier to ensure [due process]{.underline}]{.mark}**

        1.  **[BMW factors were too mushy, so courts makes them concrete]{.mark}**

    iii. Pros: easier application/administration, can adjust to the reprehensibility of behavior, maintains connection between actual injury and punitive award, consistency & therefore notice of severity

    iv. Cons: concerns for under-punishment, under-deterrence, DF will prefer this when CD is low

        1.  **State CL has never declared a hard number**, so should court be setting a hard number -- too much for CL court to do/stepping into legislature's shoes? (Ginsburg dissent in SF)

        2.  **Promotes empty consistency -- the type that doesn't further aims of tort law. CD so low then PD must make up for it for deterrence, incentive to sue from PLs, etc.**

e.  **[[Verbal/Jury Instructions (exists in MD):]{.underline}]{.mark}**

    i.  **[Exxon]{.underline}: mushy, but courts use them all the time**

    ii. **[[Phillips Morris's]{.underline} take on [BMW factors]{.underline}: fact-finders can take harm by D against non-parties into account to determine the level of reprehensibility (DF has pattern and overarching motive = reprehensible), but only factor in the harm suffered by the P when calculating PD.]{.mark}**

        1.  Concerned about windfall to the P

    iii. Pros: flexible, adaptable, can avoid over or under punishment/deterrence

    iv. Cons: inconsistent, unclear

    v.  **MD jury instructions: (1)** amount will deter, (2) not shock the conscience, and (3) doesn't bankrupt (professor: why not -- no exam, argue bankruptcy should be allowed. Counter: would hurt third-parties like employees of company who will be out of job, bad for economy)

        1.  **Notice that these look exactly like the criteria for using PD in the first place -- circular? Should we go for something more concrete?**

### BMW Factors

- SCOTUS laid out three guideposts in reviewing constitutionality of PD in **[BMW v. Gore:]{.underline}**

A.  **[Reprehensibility of D's conduct]{.mark}**

    a.  Pure economic harm is less reprehensible than reckless disregard for the health and safety of others

    b.  **[Phillip Morris]{.underline}** ruled that evidence of harm to non-parties should be used to determine the level of responsibility of D's actions, but cannot be considered in awarding punitive damages to the P for punishing D directly

B.  **[Disparity between the CD and PD]{.mark}**

    a.  **[State Farm]{.underline}** rules that single digit ratios are most likely to satisfy due process

C.  **[Similar to other civil and criminal penalties in comparable cases?]{.mark}**

    a.  Reasoning: Democratically elected legislature is good measure of how much society wants from DF.

    b.  **Reasoning fading now bc these counter-arguments as to their use to restrict PD**

        i.  Legislature made law ex ante, PD is assigned ex post. PD is supposed to be flexible bc we already have forward-looking law.

        ii. At least as to civil penalties, the function is different (here is about punishment as well)

        iii. [When law was written, legislature already knew tort PD existed & took that into account (meant to accompany tort PD, not replace it)]{.mark}

###

### 

### [POLICY CONSIDERATIONS FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES]{.mark}

a.  [Deterrence]{.underline}: make reprehensible behavior more expensive for DFs. CD awards are too small -- PDs grab their attention and force changes.

b.  [Corrective Justice]{.underline}: not all victims of reprehensible behavior will come forward; PD can correct for victims who do not hold DF liable + internalize the harm

c.  [Legitimate and Consistent]{.underline}: general rules need to make damages consistent to satisfy due process esp. bc civil DF don't enjoy benefit of heightened protection for crim DFs (preponderance of evidence v. beyond a reasonable doubt).

    i.  **Counter**: too much consistency PD predictable and just another cost of doing business. Could also be good because DFs take calculation of PD into account and change their behavior to reduce PD.

d.  [Role of the Court]{.underline}: (1) **PM** limits PD calculation from harm to nonparties. Should we take into account all harm outside the PL? Is this not fair? Can courts look at broader societal problem when DF is being tried just for the harm to PL? (2) **SF's** single-digit multiplier appropriate for court to do? Isn't it job of legislature? (Ginsburg SF)

e.  [Efficiency]{.underline}: do not want to overdeter or overpunish D, which will not be an efficient and cheap method of avoiding the harm 🡪 consider the benefits vs. utilities as well

f.  [Fairness]{.underline}:

    i.  Due Process concerns -- do not want to punish D without notice or provision of a fair opportunity to defend its behavior. Predictability gives chance to change its behavior.

    ii. Overpunish -- juries may favor reprehensibility into CD subconsciously, duplicating PD (should D pay for more than the total harm internalized?)

    iii. Overcompensation: should a windfall to P be justified? Getting compensated for D's harm on a societal basis and not just the P? Some states' statute send the PD to the state itself or to a fund for future P; does this provide [perverse incentives]{.underline} to state courts to PD for more budget?

g.  **[[Justifiable Calculations/Pinto paradox]{.underline}]{.mark}: Ford in *Pinto* did an honest calculation of valuing life (from the government) versus the cost of redesigning car and the jury crushed Ford with PD for [putting a price on life]{.underline}.**

    i.  **[Ironically, fact-finders (who are in the business of determining negligence/BPL) are biased against using BPL and calculations when humans are involved in the equation]{.mark}**

## REPEATING PUNITIVE DAMAGES PROBLEM 

A.  PDs punish for harm more than to the PL but when this is repeated 🡪 overlapping punishment to D.

    a.  But PM court holds that considering other PLs harms in the amount of PD is unconstitutional, but this may still happen with its confusing language & allows for consideration to determine reprehensibility.

    b.  Grant of big PD may actually incentivize other PLs to sue. Seems like harm to non-parties is repeated because PD #1 to Plaintiff A takes into account reprehensible behavior to Plaintiff B, but PD #2 to Plaintiff B also gets paid for his harms or even takes into account the reprehensible behavior to Plaintiff A leading to overlap.

    c.  **[Some states have only allow huge recovery for first PL to sue bc it provides incentive to sue. Subsequent PLs don't need this incentive and benefit from certainty of recovery.]{.mark}**

        i.  **[Supports no cap/fixed multiplier!]{.mark}**

        ii. **[We do this bc over-deterrence is unproductive and also constitutional concerns/unfair to DF.]{.mark}**

        iii. [**Pro**: Incentivizes to be first to sue -- brings problems to court faster.]{.mark}

        iv. [**Con**: First isn't always the most deserving? Why should we treat PLs who have been harmed similarly differently just based on who managed to sue first?]{.mark}

            1.  [**Favors the wealthy/those with lawyers who actually may need the money the least**.]{.mark}

    d.  **[All of this depends on how you view the initial lawsuit: (1) What did DF do to YOU specifically (chuck of bad that hits different DFs) vs. (2) What has DF exposed society to (one big bad)?]{.mark}**

        i.  [PM seems to go with first view? But allows 2^nd^ view as to reprehensibility? Confusing.]{.mark}

B.  CLASS ACTIONS?

    a.  Solution to this problem: class actions could fix this because it establishes a pattern of behavior instead of repeated punishment. Calculate reprehensibility in one shot and divide among Ps. Mass tort is difficult though because common question of law/fact are often missing.

    b.  **[[But should we allow PD for CA (frontier of tort law)?]{.underline}]{.mark}**

        i.  **[NO: PLs are all here, represented, etc. So CD is enough of deterrence. No need to account for missing PLs.]{.mark}**

        ii. **[Yes: There are other PLs for different harms (not common question of law/fact & therefore not part of the CA), these people were also affected & won't sue unless PDs are granted.]{.mark}**

        iii. **[Exxon managed to get a mandatory PD Class Action. Maybe that's a solution?]{.mark}**

## Vicarious Liability

**Respondeat superior = \"let the superior answer\"**

- Employer is liable for certain torts committed by employee

- Employer need not be negligent - just need an employee to be negligent \"within the scope of employment\" 🡺 **So a SL TORT!**

- Theory is that employer is probably in better position to research and make decisions re: activity level and other changes to activities, saves info costs bc hard to prove employer to be neg. as well.

**Two questions about respondeat superior:**

- Who is an employee?

  - Seeks to distinguish between situations in which strict liability will have a desirable effect and when it will not

  - Does not include independent contractors (e.g. homeowner hires an electrician)

- When is a tort committed within the scope of employment?

  - Limits the effects of strict liability on employers

  - Employers do not have infinite capacity to control the conduct of their employees

  - Distinguishes between a \"detour\" and a \"frolic\" -- NOT a bright-line rule

  - Employer liable for tortious acts committed on a \"mere\" detour but not on a frolic

**[Exxon's court is split 4:4 on liability to company in maritime law. So BP may or may not be liable for actions of its employee on the Deepwater Horizon.]{.mark}**

- [But politically terrible move to litigate this, so probably won't come to SCOTUS.]{.mark}

# Statutory Damages

## Definition

- Damages whose amount (or range) is set by law, usually without regard to the actual harm suffered by the PL.

  - For PL: simplifies proofs, awards damages w/o requiring them to proffer evidence of actual harm

  - For DF: become a multiplier of liability, esp. when claims or parties are aggregated. Often unpredictable bc wide range of statutory damages.

## Policy for Statutory Damages

- Statues are for crime-like activities, which makes people think of PD.

  - **Counter**: Then if it's criminal-like & punishment is purpose, shouldn't we afford DF the protections of criminal law?

  - **Counter-counter**: Courts have never come out & said that statutory damages are punishment. Would be problematic bc there will be overlap between federal civil penalties and crim penalties.

- Statues give fair notice to DFs & has deterrent effect & predictable

- **Makes litigation more attractive when damages are hard to calculate (traditional rationale for statutory damages)**

[**Possible alternative:** Floor-only statutory damages would preserve deterrent effect, incentive to litigate when damages are hard to calculate, punishment-like function. Counter is that that increases unpredictability.]{.mark}

**[Also, what does a [wide range of damages]{.underline} provided by statute mean? Congress's intent?]{.mark}**

A.  Statute covers a wide range of activity, therefore wide range of damages so you can tailor to that activity, **OR**

B.  They really meant these numbers for any act prohibited by the statute.

**[Sony v. Tenebaum, CA1 (2013)]{.underline}** -- DF downloaded 30 songs, was warned by dad & school. when accused, blamed someone else. The real problem was that he was distributing those songs (file-sharing program). Sony sues him & court awards statutory damages provided by Copyright Act, which offers a pretty big range of damages. CA1 affirms DC's second ruling.

- In these cases, juries are insistent on giving big awards (within the statutory range). Judge is trying to figure out how to restrain this.

- DC's second trial:

1.  Cannot reduce damages by CL remitter bc it doesn't shock the conscience

2.  **Due process analysis: PD/BMW factors don't apply, instead go with Williams (1919) -- old railroad case.**

    a.  **Why BMW doesn't work: (2) & (3) don't make sense in the context of statutory damages.**

        i.  \(2\) ratio element: the point of SD is to make it easier for PL to dispense with proof of actual injury (bc it's hard to do that in these cases).

            1.  **Counter: The span, range shows Congressional intent for proportionality, tailoring to actual harm, want judge/jury to make the fit tighter. [This is the right kind of consistency -- the fit between harm and damages.]{.underline}**

        ii. \(3\) similar law: can't compare SD to itself.

            1.  **Counter: there are other laws that deal with similar activities, or criminal law.**

    b.  **There will probably be a circuit split on the applicability of BMW or Williams on statutory damages. Huang prefers application of BMW.**

    c.  **Williams (CA1 goes with this):** Statutory damages comports with due process as long as it cannot be said to be severe and oppressive that it's obviously unreasonable. Highly deferential.

# Mass Torts Class Actions

## FUNCTION of Class Actions

A.  **Advantages of Class Actions for Each Group**

    a.  **PL**: \$ too small can be aggregated, pool (legal) resources, improve leverage for settlement, establish pattern

    b.  **DF**: world peace, preclusion effects, save resources

    c.  **Societal**: efficient, consistent results, substitute for PD, distributive benefits

## APPLICATION of Class Actions 

A.  **[Litigation Class Actions]{.underline}**

    a.  Concerns: in mass torts, damages and circumstances for plaintiffs are too varied (unlike consumer actions, civil rights actions). Must still pass FRCP Rule 23

    b.  Rule 23(a) -- 4 conditions that must be met for all class actions (in order to satisfy DP):

        i.  23(a)(1) -- numerosity

        ii. [23(a)(2) -- commonality ("there are questions of law or fact common to the class,")]{.mark}

            1.  **[Walmart]{.underline} -- Title VII action, 1.5 million women sue, different levels & different injuries** (**Scalia majority):** Implies that common question is not good enough. There must be "same injury", "common answer" from resolution of law suit; not just a pleading standard.

                a.  Look for: single actor (e.g. same manager, regional manager) or policy, test

                b.  Questions not good enough: Do managers have discretion over pay? (**Huang**: Not sure if that's a joke, it goes to corporate policy, may be close question)

            2.  **[Walmart]{.underline} (Ginsburg dissent):** Majority turns 23(a)(2) into 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement, which should not apply to (b)(1) & (b)(2) classes

        iii. 23(a)(3) -- typicality ("the claims or defenses of the representatives parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and")

        iv. 23(a)(4) -- adequacy ("the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class"

    c.  Rule 23(b) -- types of class actions -- you need judge to certify at least one.

        i.  (b)(1)(A) -- inconsistency: incompatible standards of conduct

        ii. (b)(1)(B) -- limited fund

        iii. (b)(2) -- injunctive class: applies to everyone

        iv. (b)(3) -- damages class -- requires predominance and superiority

            1.  Extra protections ((**1) can opt-out to sue on your own**, **(2) notice required (but how much of it actually gets accomplished -- do people pay attention to what they get in the mail?)**)

    d.  Certification in litigation CA is usually adversarial (sometimes DF might want CA for peace). You can appeal certification decision with Rule 23(f).

        i.  **Anytime during the process, parties can settle [w/o approval of the judge.]{.underline}**

B.  **[Two questions:]{.underline}**

    a.  **What needs to be common/predominant? (Posner CA7, CA6 agrees, BP CA5)**

        i.  **[Parko]{.underline} (Posner: Certification denied) --** 90 years of water contamination, about 150 property owners sue for damages done to property value, multiple sources of contamination affecting multiple DFs, **not sure if it reached water supply**

        ii. **[Met-coil]{.underline} (Posner: Certification approved) --** single source of pollution, reached water supply

            1.  **[Single source of injury, liability is enough. These are two extremes. Somewhere between them is line between certification & non-certification.]{.mark}**

        iii. [**[Sears]{.underline} (Posner: Certification approved) -** moldy washing machine case]{.mark}

             1.  **[No same damages (Interprets [Comcast]{.underline}, a SCOTUS case where court just stopped short of saying that you need common damages. Holding of the case was based on theory of liability.), Walmart made commonality = predominance, so treat it like same thing.]{.mark}**

                 a.  ***[There are ways to break up the class action like subclasses]{.mark}*** (e.g. Rule 23(c)(5) subclasses for different injuries, different damages, etc.)

        iv. **[BP CA5:]{.mark}**

            1.  **[What's enough:]{.mark}**

                a.  **[Single source of liability (e.g. defense of superseding clause, BP's actions, punitive damages)]{.mark}**

                    i.  **[DF-focused questions]{.mark}**

                    ii. **[[Huang: PDs really central to everyone's claims? Just for economic damages? Link back to punitive damages class action (Exxon)]{.underline}]{.mark}**

            2.  **[Not required: Same damages]{.mark}**

    b.  **What if some class members were not injured much/at all? (Posner CA7, CA6 agrees, BP CA5)**

        1.  **[Parko --]{.underline}** 140 out of 150 may not have been injured. Having to prove injury at certification stage would get rid of advantage/point of class actions, **[therefore, don't worry about this during certification.]{.mark}**

        2.  **[Sears --]{.underline}** there are ways to break up CA when it's inefficient bc lack of commonality.

            a.  ***[This can extend to mass torts even with its problems of lack of commonality. The underlying assumption is when CA is certified, case will settle.]{.mark}***

        3.  **[[ADEQUACY ISSUE: BP CA5]{.underline}: There's no cap in the settlement, therefore no intra-class conflict & therefore no adequacy problem.]{.mark}**

    c.  **[[CIRCUIT SPLIT ON PD in MARITIME LAW FOR RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

C.  **[Settlement Class Actions]{.underline}**

    a.  Unlike litigation classes, these class actions are intended to settle. DF agreed to settle with putative class members even when the certification question is decided. (Rule 23(e))

    b.  **DF & PLs walk in with [certification and agreement]{.underline} and seek judge's approval. This is not an adversarial process, but unlike settlement requires judge's approval for the settlement.**

    c.  **Rule 23(3) requires a [fairness hearing]{.mark} where judge may decide that agreement on its face is unfair** or **third-parties can object to it**, providing some **adversarial elements**. Judge must deal with some of the **substance of the deal here.**

        i.  **Pros**: saves time and cost of litigations.

        ii. **Concerns:**

            1.  Absent PLs interest are less visible/represented (settlement binds them too)

            2.  Mismatched bargaining power may lead to unfair settlements

            3.  May reflect inaccurate facts bc there was no adversarial process

            4.  **Collusion between PL and DF attorneys to make \$\$ (Drives Amchem court holding)**

    d.  [**[Amchem]{.underline} addresses some of these issues--** did NOT allow a settlement class action because of **inadequate adequacy** and **lack of predominance**.]{.mark}

        i.  First time SCOTUS dealt with settlement class action

        ii. Lawyers brought a deal that bound future PLs will develop cancer due to exposure, but the deal was very bad for them.

            1.  **Adequacy issue**: Agreement does not help future PLs & only benefits a portion of the class.

                a.  **In mass torts, risk of intra-class conflicts must be considered. Subclasses may be an answer, but then you may run into numerosity issues.**

            2.  **Predominance issue**: There are multiple sources of injury.

        iii. **[Holding: For settlement class actions, you still need to satisfy Rule 23(a) & (b); fairness hearing is not by itself enough.]{.mark}**

        iv. **[Aftermath:]{.underline}** raises the bar for settlement class actions. Certification of mass tort litigation and settlement class actions are difficult in federal court, so many resort to alternatives like MDL & quasi-CAs.

D.  **[Punitive Damages Class Actions (Exxon)]{.underline}**

    a.  **Pros**:

        i.  Better deterrence

        ii. Avoids repeated PD problem

    b.  **Cons**:

        i.  If court is not dealing much with each individual PL's specific injury, what are you punishing DF for? Implicates fairness concerns (DF should only be liable for specific injuries) v. utilitarian view (make DF feel it & PLs have a hard time proving causation).

        ii. Could deprive nonparties of due process. PLs might be able to receive punitive damages in the future because of preclusion

        iii. Exclusion from a punitive damages class action means PD will be unavailable as a carrot to contingency-fee attorneys in the future; less wiling to represent the victims

        iv. May preclude people who could have gotten awards or class members who do not have injuries now but want to make claims later

## [ALTERNATIVES To Class Actions]{.mark} 

### Multi-District Litigation (MDL) 

a.  **[MDL: *temporary* transfer of single actions pending in different districts which involve one or more common questions of law or fact to a SINGLE district for consolidated trial under single judge.]{.mark}**

    i.  Differs from class actions: **(1) No absent class members** (unless one of the consolidated action is a class action), **(2) Does not bind**, and **(3) Cannot opt-out.**

    ii. At a certain stage when the MDL becomes untenable, inefficient to run consolidated, judge ends MDL, **sample PLs from pool are selected for trial that represent range of harms, PLs, etc. (A LOT like Pose**

        1.  In reality, most parties settle after consolidation is ended & if not, after the test trials bc parties know how much to expect & save litigation costs.

        2.  If parties don't want to settle, then they are not precluded from litigating.

        3.  **In [Vioxx]{.underline}, 16 test cases were run till the end (11 won), and using the results, compensation formula was created and [Vioxx]{.underline} set up a fund & settled.**

b.  Food for though: Should opt-outs be available?

c.  **[BP went from MDL to Class Action]{.mark}**

    i.  **BP set up GCCF voluntarily (\$20 billion) and started paying right away even before trials** motivated by publicity & prodding by Obama.

        1.  Managed by Feinberg, but he seems stingy with the \$\$ & is being paid by BP to do his job. PLs unhappy.

    ii. **Suits from businesses are consolidated into a MDL in the 5^th^ cir. in front of Judge Barbier.**

        1.  CL: no liability for just economic losses, but federal statutes allows for this.

        2.  Thousands of lawyers are put into a PL steering committee, resulting in some coordination problems.

    iii. PLs decide to set up a **settlement class action** & BP goes with this bc they want **global peace.**

         1.  Concern might've been binding missing PLs, but there's already a lot of them from MDL.

         2.  **Incentive to settle fast before trial against U.S. on allocating fault. That trial resulted in GN ruling for BP (opens up PD possibilities that were shut off by settlement)**

         3.  **[Settlement: (1) [no cap]{.underline} & payment starts right away (2) GCCF is gone & that money is used to pay PLs now (3) [no evidence of causation]{.underline} for certain PLs -- just need to show economic damages and say under threat of perjury that those injuries were caused by BP]{.mark}**

    iv. **Judge certifies, and objectors appeal resulting in BP II, an BP appeals resulting in BP IV. Court-appointed Juneau is fast & loose with \$\$ and BP starts to regret.**

        1.  **BP II** - no causation requirement causes (1) issues of commonality/predominance requirement of Rule 23 and (2) some PLs aren't even injured to be paid.

            a.  **[Court agrees with Posner on these points. THERE IS NO CIRCUIT SPLIT on CLASS ACTIONS, may have pushed back on Walmart.]{.mark}**

            b.  **Adds to Posner on situations where some PLs may not be harmed at all: no adequacy issue bc no cap = no intra-class conflict**

        2.  **BP IV --** matter of contract interpretation

            a.  Can't interpret as no causation bc then people who weren't injured will get paid.

            b.  **Court: (a) evidence you knew this was what you were agreeing to, and (b) claimers are under threat of perjury & therefore, not unreasonable.**

                i.  Court saying to BP: go after those people with perjury suit. But that's expensive for BP.

                ii. Court protects purpose of class actions (like Posner) by saying we don't have to worry about individual causation at the certification process.

        3.  [[However, circuits are split on **punitive damages in maritime law for respondeat superior. SCOTUS may take this up**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

d.  **Judges' role:**

    i.  Although they don't have technical authority, it's understood that judges have heightened equitable powers for MDL to ensure fairness (since Rule 23 protections are not available).

        1.  E.g. Post 9/11, Judge Hellerstein didn't have authority, but demanded revisions to the settlement agreement, etc. & 2^nd^ Cir. allowed this.

        2.  E.g. In government v. financial institutions, judges have been more active even when you don't have formal Rule 23 requirements.

### Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF) & 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) -- Pros & Cons

a.  Questions to ask: *how they are created, who creates them and how they are managed*

b.  9/11 VCF: Congress set it up as part of package through legislation (contracting out of tort law because it restricts litigation, but legislature *adds legitimacy*)

    i.  Allows PLs to recover for mass tort with no culpable DF

    ii. No cap on funds

    iii. Provides mechanism to appeal individual claims, due process values

    iv. Easier to administer: centralized admission, but difficult to decide who could receive damages on behalf of decedents

    v.  [How much tort principles do we want to use?]{.mark}

        1.  [Pain and suffering: Did not resort to tort law & provided equal amount to everyone bc it's not humane]{.mark}

        2.  [Lost future earnings calculation -- used tort principles.]{.mark}

        3.  [Think BP's no causation -- there they waived tort principles.]{.mark}

c.  GCCF: BP set it up themselves & appointed Feinburg (same person as 9/11), but failed due to legitimacy issues bc he was paid by BP.
