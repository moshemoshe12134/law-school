**[Who Decides?]{.underline}**

**Judge vs. Jury**

Punitive damages: how should they be limited?

Whether someone was negligent

Standard of care

Jury instructions

Jury determines how negligent plaintiff was and compares to defendant's negligence Duty

● Judge

o Pros

o Cons

● Jury

o Pros

▪ Can consider what the everyday person does (do you have to get out of your car to check for a train?)

o Cons

**Court vs. Legislature**

●

**[Institutional Competence]{.underline}**

Malpractice

2 schools of thought

3

But layman might know better! "common knowledge"

Custom (TJ Hooper)

Statute

But person might know what's safer in the moment!

Maybe folks can work it out amongst themselves (Coase theorem)

**[Tailoring?]{.underline}**

Expertise (standard of care)

Adult activities (standard of care)

Childhood (standard of care)

Dangerous activities (strict liability)

Care needed under the circumstances

Custom

How much warning is necessary?

Remedy to the harm -- injunction: are money damages sufficient? Damages to how much harm the defendants caused (BP, market share liability) Punitive damages -- connected to compensatory

**[Balancing]{.underline}**

BPL

Deterrence but not overdeterrence

Optimal deterrence

Custom

Unreasonableness of a trespass/nuisance

Hardships (injunction test)

**[Proportionality]{.underline}**

Pure comparative negligence

Child vs. adult

**[Binary/All or Nothing]{.underline}**

Contributory negligence

Duty or no duty (as a matter of law, by judge)

Absolute deterrence

Malpractice

Negligence per se

Strict liability -- no matter how negligent you were

Created risk vs. didn't

Cause in fact vs. not

ALWAYS strict liability for wild animals

Physical damage pure emotional/pure economic recovery

**[Counterfactuals]{.underline}**

Lost chance damages

But for cause

**[Context]{.underline}**

How much warning is needed?

Private necessity defense affects what the owner's responsibility to the trespasser is. The potential liability on you makes you assess the risks and harms.

Nuisance: unreasonableness!

Who sets the price for the right to decide whether nuisance/trespass continues? Depends on who wins and which relief is selected

Vicarious liability: in scope of employment?

Strict liability for domesticated animals

**[Rules vs. Standards]{.underline}**

Duty (rule) vs. due care (standard)

● Rules

o Pros

▪ Ex ante predictability

▪ Easy administration

▪ Consistent

o Cons

▪ Harsh (all or nothing)

▪ Ex post not flexible

▪ Arbitrary -- ignores some facts

▪ Do judges really know what ordinary care is?

5

▪ Can be unfair, since exceptions are hard to carve out

● Standards: mandatory considerations

o Pros

▪ Ex post fairness

▪ Judicial discretion to consider mitigating/aggravating facts

▪ Allows exceptions

▪ Can change with time

o Cons

▪ Ex ante unpredictability

▪ Hard to administer

▪ Inconsistent results in court (judicial discretion)

▪ Courts may not always be the best institution to handle the complexities

**[Info Forcing]{.underline}**

Alternative liability

Coase theorem -- do they talk to each other? Find least cost avoider

**[Internalization]{.underline}**

Optimal deterrence

Coase theorem / putting injunction on one party

Least cost avoider

Necessity defense (forces owner to internalize)

Strict liability (you break, you pay)

**[Accounting for Third Parties]{.underline}**

Public interest (injunction test)

Harm to public (Phillip Morris)

**[Plaintiffs' Role]{.underline}**

Comparative negligence

Contributory negligence

Coase theorem: plaintiff could move away from the harm

Nuisance: plaintiff could move away

**[Objective]{.underline}**

Least cost avoider

Reasonable person

**[Subjective]{.underline}**

Trespass (possessor's feeling of exclusive possession)

Nuisance (possessor's feeling of interference with use/enjoyment)

**[Limiting Principles]{.underline}**

● Statutes

● Due process (punitive damages)

● Proximate cause / scope of liability

● Rules & standards

● Caps (damages, compensation funds)

● Ratios

● Duty (limits liability)

● Reasonableness

● Age (on whether you can be negligent)

● Purely emotional & purely economic loss (limited by physical damage and limits themselves on compensatory damages)

● Foreseeability (i.e., Quisenberry)

● Feelings (nuisance and trespass)

**Aims of Tort Law**

**Aims of tort law**: justifications for why we're making people bear the costs of their torts 1. Corrective Justice: restoring moral balance between victim and wrongdoer; harm here is the moral imbalance

a\. An argument for loss of chance applying to people who survived

2\. Civil Recourse: provide victims with recourse for civil wrongs; give them a space to air their grievances

3\. Redress of Social Grievances: similar to civil recourse, but for society to air their grievances 4. Deterrence: deter excessively risky activity and incentivize precautions

a\. Optimal deterrence: make them internalize costs so that they can decide whether the activity is worth it for them

i\. But then loss of chance doesn't do optimal deterrence since you can only get loss of chance damages if you die

b\. Absolute deterrence: make it never worth it to do this activity

i\. Damages are based on what it takes defendant to stop / defendant focused (not related to what plaintiff suffers)

5\. Loss distribution: let insurance pay

6\. Compensation: (not really a theory, more just a fact)

More complicated aims:

● Punitive damages

● Least (cheapest) cost avoider

● Qualified immunity

● Optimal (internalize harms) vs. absolute deterrence

What is tort law?

\- mainly concerns the rights of private parties to obtain monetary compensation from those who have caused them injury or damage

\- Most of tort law is common law (made my courts rather than legislatures). 8

**Finding Someone Liable Under Tort Law**

![](media/image1.png){width="6.666666666666667in" height="1.90625in"}

**[1. Duty]{.underline}**

Without a duty, there CANNOT be tort liability, even if someone was negligent.

No matter what juries want to do. No matter the facts.

Judges can decide as a matter of law that there is a duty -- bright line rule.

[Discussion: who should decide? Should it be a bright line for all time or case-by-case?]{.mark}

There can be liability for **omissions** but not if you didn't create risk, get involved, or have special relationship (*Moch v. Rensselaer Water Co*).

**When you create the risk**

If you didn't create the risk, it's hard to show that you had a duty.

If you created the risk, you have a duty.

Hypo: what if you created the risk non-negligently? Do you have a duty? Unsettled.

***Products Liability***

Hood v. Ryobi: warning must be clear and sufficient to warn ordinary consumer of danger, didn't need to list all possible injuries

**Affirmative Duty: Duty to Warn or Rescue**

Duty to mitigate harm, [even though you didn't create the risk]{.underline}.

Duty to warn arises from ex ante knowledge.

If no duty, not liable if you didn't warn/rescue (*Cuyler*)

Hypo: does someone who said they were a designated driver but didn't do it have a duty to the third party harmed by the drunk driver? Unsettled.

Argue about policy / aims of tort law: should tort law cover that designated driver's failure, assuming the other elements of a tort are met?

Didn't create the risk, maybe they undertook to preemptively rescue.

9

> ***Special Relationship***

Tarasoff: medical health professional had duty to warn victim because he had a special relationship to the injurer (it was his patient). In assessing whether to warn, consider whether the threat is serious, imminent, and directed at a certain person.

***Undertaking a Rescue***

You got involved, so now you have a duty to help out non-negligently.

**No Duty**

You didn't create the risk, undertake a rescue, or have a special relationship.

If no duty, the judge has decided as a matter of law that person cannot be liable.

Sets precedent.

**2. [Negligent]{.underline} (Breach of Duty Not to Be Negligent)**

![](media/image4.png){width="6.666666666666667in" height="1.4583333333333333in"}

**Did they breach the duty not to be negligent?**

If you weren't negligent, it doesn't matter if you caused harm, you can't be held liable (unless strict liability).

**Restatement §3 Definition of Negligence**: "Primary factors to consider in ascertaining whether the person's conduct lacks reasonable care are:

● The [foreseeable]{.underline} likelihood that the person's conduct will result in harm

● The [foreseeable]{.underline} severity of any harm that may ensue, and

● The \[[foreseeable\]]{.underline} burden of precautions to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm."

**BPL (*Carroll Towing*)**

Learned Hand's economic formulation of negligence: **conduct is negligent when the reasonably foreseeable cost of the accident outweighs the reasonably foreseeable cost of precautions**

Rationale: tries to structure jury's thinking a little

**●** Essentially lays out a cost benefit analysis; **a reasonable person would do this sort of cost-benefit analysis and take precautions that are worth it**

● Focus on avoiding foreseeable harms when we can do foreseeable good. Why not try to avoid unforeseeable harms? We don't want people to take into account freak accidents. Over-deterrence. Doesn't do any good. (Doesn't serve aims of tort laws.)

10

● Note: don't argue BPL to the jury because they won't like hearing that a company didn't think it was worth it to take a precaution that could have saved this life. (Don't Do the Math article.)

Analysis:

1\. B = foreseeable burden of taking an untaken precaution that a reasonable person would have taken

2\. PL together indicate the foreseeable good that taking the precaution would have done / how much it would have helped reduce the likelihood of harm

a\. P = foreseeable probability of accident if precaution is not taken

b\. L = foreseeable harm from accident attributable to defendant's actions

[i. Discussion: who's harms? Just plaintiffs? Whole world's?]{.mark}

3\. Compare the halves of the equation: (ON EXAM, ARGUE BOTH SIDES)

a\. If B \< PL precaution worth taking (reasonable)

b\. If B \> PL precaution not worth taking (unreasonable)

Criticisms:

● Implies tolerating risk

● Problem of commensurability/comparability

● How to measure B/P/L? [How precise does it need to be?]{.mark}

Note: cost of life weighed differently than loss of property; efforts to save life are not negligent unless they are rash (*Eckert v. LIRR*).

**Standards of Care**

The jury decides what ordinary care is.

***Reasonable Person***

How much reasonableness is appropriate is determined by jury according to specific circumstances. i.e., A reasonable person under the circumstances would have \_\_\_\_. You didn't \_\_\_ so you were negligent.

Defendant: It's not foreseeable that a reasonable person would \_\_\_ so it's not our duty to take precautions against that. = mutual expectation of reasonableness

Objective standard: not about intent, about action/what they did and could have done.

Note: tort law sometimes allows in **evidence of expertise / above average skill**, but not below average skill (i.e., *Core v. NC Parks & Rec* plaintiff was on the swim team)

Still not totally subjective; we're asking what a person of this skill level would think/do, not what this person would reasonably do.

***Children***

Semi-objective standard for reasonableness

[Justification]{.underline}: no deterrent effect in regulating kids' behavior; they'll grow out of it [Challenge:]{.underline} the strict rule doesn't comport with neuroscience and different rates of development/maturity

+==============+========================================================================================================================================================================================+

**External Sources for Judging Reasonableness of Care**

Jury determines whether someone fell short of required level of care, and sometimes uses external sources (NOT FROM TORT LAW) to inform whether the defendant was negligent. ![](media/image2.png){width="3.8020833333333335in" height="2.3645833333333335in"}

***Industry/Business Customs***

● Doesn't automatically determine liability or excuse from liability

o Piece of evidence about reasonableness

● The custom need not be universal to inform an assessment of reasonable care ● Seeing how people tend to do these things can inform jury, but doesn't have to o TJ Hooper: maybe whole industry is negligent; you still need to take this precaution -- maybe the fact that everyone is doing the same thing doesn't tell you much about whether that's negligent

***Malpractice (Professional Custom)***

● Noncompliance = negligence

● Compliance = not negligent

● Experts testify to the "standard of the profession"

● Defense:

o Two schools of thought / respectable minority

▪ Most jurisdictions allow meeting alternative standard to be considered

"compliance"

o Common knowledge: if a doctor's conduct was obviously negligence, you don't need an expert to testify to that (e.g., he left a clamp inside you after surgery)

● Jury's role: choose which expert to believe, choose whether to follow secondary school of thought = jury still has to make the call about what was the standard in the first place

12

> ***Statutory Negligence (Negligence Per Se)***

● Noncompliance = negligence

o BUT under Cuyler, you still need a duty first

o Even though a statute set a standard for behavior, it was an administrative statute, so it didn't create a tort.

o Can use it as a standard of behavior but you need a duty first. Need a tort first. ● Compliance = still could be found negligent

o Just because you met this statute, other considerations could still mean you're negligent ● These statutes are not defining torts, but torts borrowed expectations from other areas of law to inform the reasonableness standard

o A reasonable person would have lived up to that expectation

● Elements:

o i. defendant violated statute during tort;

o ii. plaintiff is intended beneficiary of protective statute;

o iii. harm is the harm that is intended to be protected against by statute;

o iv. causation + harm

● Defense:

o The harm caused wasn't the point of the statute

▪ Counterargument: secondary purpose

o It's safer to not follow the statute

● Jury's role: jury has to figure out what statute means and then whether someone lived up to it

**If both parties are negligent**

***Comparative Negligence***

Pure: damages apportioned proportionally according to % fault

> ![](media/image6.png){width="2.4270833333333335in" height="1.3229166666666667in"}

Modified: damages apportioned proportionally up until plaintiff is 50/\>50% responsible; then plaintiff recovers nothing

Justification: accords with moral blame and deterrence

***Contributory Negligence***

Affirmative defense (defendant bears burden of proof)

If plaintiff is even one tiny bit negligent, they don't recover anything.

So even if defendant is strictly liable, plaintiff can't recover.

**[3. Strict Liability]{.underline}**

13

**Should we hold them liable [even if they weren't negligent,]{.underline} as long as they *caused* the harm?**

**(note: still have to do the causation and harm analysis)**

Given that we have either negligence or strict liability, do we need the other?

Modern (dangerous activity) starts with negligence and asks if we should add strict liability. Traditional (animals) starts with strict liability and asks if we should add negligence. ● Arguments for strict liability

o Commonplace activity and there's not often a resulting harm

o Not a high risk / high harm activity

o Carefulness can make a difference

▪ NOTE: this requires defendant to say they weren't careful enough

● Arguments against strict liability

o Manage the activity: encourage people to not do this at all (i.e., don't bring fireworks on the train)

o High risk / high harm activity

o Couldn't have been any more careful

**Abnormally Dangerous Activity**

Posner's gloss on the **Restatement §24** factors (from *Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad*) in determining whether strict liability should apply:

Abnormally dangerous means **high risk, high harm** -- you want to think about:

● (1) would being more careful in activity (due care) have helped? AND

o If no, leans towards strict liability

o Who could have been more careful about what?

▪ Indiana Harbor Belt RR: Transporters could have been more careful about

checking valves which would have made all the difference -- **[entirely]{.underline}**

**[preventable accident if someone had been more careful]{.underline}**. SO negligence liability is all you need.

o Ballooning (1822): no, he was ballooning as safely as he could, not careless -- once he chose to engage in the activity, there was no more care he could have exercised but didn't

● (2) would being wiser about choice of activity have helped?

o If yes, leans towards strict liability

o Would putting liability/incentives on choice of activity have done any good? ▪ Indiana Harbor Belt RR: Not really SO managing activity through strict liability might not have done much good. The manufacturing/routing is set up a certain way, and we need to ship goods. = Stick with negligence standard.

o Want to pick this if being more careful wouldn't have done any good

o Ballooning (1822): yes, he could have just chosen a different activity or not done it in New York City (strict liability incentivizes people to NOT hot air balloon).

Isn't strict liability the best option because negligence sometimes lets people not pay? Sure, but Posner is looking at the history of tort law: Negligence is the default and you only bring in strict liability on an "as needed" basis, even if that takes away from perfectly incentivizing safety.

Posner says tort law:

14

● Manages **care levels** through negligence

o Huang gloss: making people be more careful can affect activity levels because being more careful makes the activity more costly/less enjoyable so you won't do it as much ● Manages **activity levels** through strict liability

o Because negligence liability won't make a difference, we need strict liability on top for certain dangerous liability.

o Huang gloss: can affect carefulness because you know you'll [internalize]{.underline} any damage you cause; you're taking account of possible harm ex ante

**Animals**

Traditionally: if you kept a [wild animal,]{.underline} it'll always be strict liability.

Rationale: activity is dangerous

[Farm/domesticated animals:]{.underline} if you knew or had reason to know (vicious tendency), you'll be strictly liable. After one bite, you should have known better.

Can we use negligence liability on top of traditional strict liability for animals? Most jurisdictions say yes. (It's just the same as negligently doing anything else. Why not have negligence liability available as well?) New York says you can be liable for negligence in handling of farm animals (hypo: cow wanders into the road and causes a car accident; you handled them negligently by failing to take precautions), but we're not extending negligent liability to pets yet.

Restatement 2d: negligence liability can apply to animals too.

**Extra Puzzle: Strict Liability of Contributory/Comparative Negligence** Under pure comparative negligence, we normally just decrease the recovery plaintiff gets the more negligent plaintiff was.

**In puzzle: Defendant falls under strict liability (so we're not talking about his negligence) but plaintiff is negligent.** It's already happened where one party is strictly liable but we compare to a different party's negligence. Defendant can be held liable under strict liability and then we still compare relative negligences to shift some damages back on plaintiff.

Negligence regime on plaintiff: Plaintiff has to bear all costs unless Defendant was negligent

+==================================================================================================+

Normally plaintiff pays all costs but then you divide up money. But we can flip it so under strict liability defendant usually pays all the costs but then we divide up the money based on comparative negliginess. NOTE: you have to find negligence on D's side before doing that.

**STRICT LIABILITY SHIFTS COSTS AWAY FROM PLAINTIFF.**

**[4. But-For Causation / Causation in Fact]{.underline}**

**But for negligent behavior, would harm have happened? Did the negligent behavior make a difference?**

If yes defendant is not liable

"But for \[negligent conduct / untaken precaution\], \[harm\] [would still]{.underline} have happened, even if it was negligent to \[conduct / untaken precaution\]."

This is what defendant wants to show

If no cause-in-fact is proven

"But for \[negligent conduct / untaken precaution\], \[harm\] [would not]{.underline} have happened." This is what plaintiff wants to show

**Restatement §26:** tortious conduct is a factual cause when the harm wouldn't have occurred absent the conduct

**Multiple Necessary Causes**

Two people were necessary causes of the accident. If either had taken a certain precaution, the accident wouldn't have happened.

**Multiple Sufficient Causes (overdetermined harm lacks but-for cause)** The only way to avoid the harm is for both people to avoid being negligent.

One situation where but-for causation is underinclusive, rather than overinclusive, because you're behavior that was sufficient to cause the harm didn't make a difference if someone else's behavior was also sufficient for the harm.

Policy considerations:

● If you punish someone who was not a but for cause, that would overdeter / make people change their behavior to avoid a freak accident or something their behavior wouldn't make a difference to (which we don't want)

16

● Spreading liability between too many people might undermine the deterrence value. ● Redefine harm to justify who pays. Is the harm the risk or the burned house?

**Restatement §26:** tortious conduct is a factual cause when the harm wouldn't have occurred absent the conduct

**Restatement §27:** multiple sufficient causes are both actual causes

**Comment d:** regardless of whether tortious or innocent; nonnegligent cause in fact is still a cause in fact

**Tort law decides to hold both multiple sufficient causes as causes in fact.**

Fills the gap created by multiple sufficient causes, since the but-for cause analysis is underinclusive when the harm is overdetermined.

Hypo: what if a natural cause is one of the MSCs? Unclear under restatement

**Restatement §36:** exception for trivial contributions

**Comment b:** exception applies only when causal contribution of various multiple sufficient causes is "susceptible to being compared on a common metric;" this might be determined by factfinder or as a matter of law

Hypo: what if some three people worked together to cause a harm; what to do if no single person were a sufficient nor necessary cause?

**Alternative Liability**

Two defendants were negligent, only one caused the harm, but you don't know who caused the harm ● Plaintiffs' problem: 50% chance either defendant caused the harm so it's impossible to prove beyond 50%/beyond a preponderance of the evidence who hurt him; plaintiff would never be able to meet his burden this way

**o** SO the court **shifts the burden of proof of causation to defendants (information forcing)**

● Could hold both defendants negligent (Summer v. Tice)

o Argument for: information forcing; distribution, given we know one of them did it o Argument against: as you get more and more defendants, it gets more morally questionable (i.e., Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly)

**Market Share Liability**

You know a group is responsible for injuries, but you don't know which member of the group harmed each specific plaintiff = court holds each member of the group responsible for their share of the harm to the public

● MSL appropriate because (narrow application):

o Signature disease (this is the only cause of that disease so you know harms were caused by these defendants)

o Identical chemical (can't tell which of these defendants caused each individual harm)

**Variations**:

● Absolute v. relative

o

● Regional v. national (connect behavior to result as much as possible)

o If lots of plaintiffs, you want a broad market to aggregate the data to inform how much of the national risk each company is responsible for

17

o If just one plaintiff, you want a narrow market to approximate who created the risk for that plaintiff

**Difference from Alternative liability**:

● Not trying to information force -- not expecting you to be able to prove the harm was caused by one of the other 300 defendants

**[5. Scope of Liability]{.underline}**

**Given that they were negligent, do we want to hold them liable?**

The heart of this stage is a policy question. Frame the argument in Aunt/Uncle terms first.

The same [**foreseeability** arguments]{.underline} fit into a traditional and modern frame

● To argue something was foreseeable, describe it in general terms to make it seem more plausible/expected

● To argue something was unforeseeable, describe it at a specific level

**Traditional Approach: Proximate Cause**

● If harm was foreseeable liable

o Phrases to use: direct harm maintained the causal chain

● If harm was not foreseeable fit into plaintiff, type, extent, manner

o Eggshell plaintiff (extent of harm)

o Phrases to use: **intervening/superseding cause** broke the causal chain

Quisenberry: employer owes a duty of care to employee's family member when it was [foreseeable]{.underline} asbestos would end up there; duty to **foreseeable plaintiff (extension of special relationship)** NOTE: dissent said this conflated duty and proximate cause

**Modern Approach (Scope of Liability): Harm Within Risk**

Similar to Cardozo in Palsgraf: scope is defined by foreseeability (as opposed to Andrews who said scope is defined by harm that happened)

● Restatement 3 changed proximate cause to this

o Clearer than proximate cause

o Still case-by-case, which is why they don't call it duty

● Was the harm that happened within the universe of reasonably *foreseeable* increased risk of harm? **[Was this the kind of harm we were worried about when we found you negligent?]{.underline}** (**Restatement 3d §29**)

o If yes, liable because you should have considered it at the time you were deciding whether to take the precaution.

o If no, not liable (unless if eggshell plaintiff/extent of harm, then still liable).

**Restatement 3d, §29:**

**Comment d:** harm is within scope of liability if the failure to take precautions against the risk of that harm is what made the defendant negligent

If the factfinder determines \[failure to take a precaution\] is negligent and a factual cause of the harm, the harm is within the scope of liability because the risk that the harm

18

would happen is among the risks that made defendant negligent for \[failure to take a precaution\].

**Comment e:** limiting liability to harm arising from the risks created by tortious conduct. Justification: provides a standard; preferable to a rule

**Comment f:** compares duty and proximate cause; chooses proximate cause approach ● Duty

o Question of law for court

o Bright line rule

o Preferable when limits on liability are clear, relative bright lines, that can apply generally, don't require resorting to fact, when they implicate a class of cases (of which jury might not have perspective), and when early resolution is particularly desirable

● Proximate cause Restatement chooses this approach

o Question of fact for factfinder

o More flexible; sets a LIMIT, not a rule

o Preferable when you need careful attention to facts of the case and to make value judgments that might turn on specific facts

**Comment g: factual cause is separate from scope of liability**

● Factual cause is a factual/historical inquiry

● Scope of liability is an evaluative question

o Separation lets court avoid causal language here

**Duty**

**Restatement 3 §29** makes it a jury question, whereas Cardozo redefines duty so it doesn't have to go to a jury.

For our sake, **keep causation separate from duty**.

**[6. Result/Harm]{.underline}**

**Loss of Chance**

Recharacterization of the harm -- rather than death, the harm is loss of chance of avoiding death. NOTE: Redefining harm affects causation and damages too

(Applies to medical malpractice)

Old regime:

New regime: held liable for difference in chance before and after medical treatment 19

**Intentional Torts**

**[Gross Negligence]{.underline}**

Just really bad negligence for our sake: "extreme departure from care required under the circumstances or failure to demonstrate even a slight care" (BP Oil Spill)

A lot of little negligent things can add up to being gross negligence

**[Property Torts]{.underline}**

Intellectual property: Though patents and copyrights are property, there's no reason to categorically exclude their holders from permanent injunctive relief (apply four party test; no special presumptions of granting re patents).

**Trespass**

Trespass elements:

1\. Intentional

2\. Intrusion

3\. Harm

Defense: Private necessity = "Defendant has acted **reasonably** in damaging or destroying the plaintiff's property in order to avoid harm to himself or his property, but the risk of harm to the plaintiff has not been created by the plaintiff." (qualified upon later compensating any damage) ● Private necessity makes a difference to the responsibility possessor has to

trespasser -- can't kick them out (or else he'll be liable/internalize costs) if

they're there for private necessity

o Ploof: dock owner undocked boat during emergency/storm; damage

happened; dock owner is liable

● Defendant still has to pay for harm done whether he trespassed or whether it was necessary

Trespass now has started to look more like nuisance (they both are starting to look the same). BUT trespass is about feelings of interference with exclusive possession and nuisance is about feelings of interference with use/enjoyment.

**Private Nuisance**

Private nuisance elements:

1\. Intentional

2\. Substantial

3\. Unreasonable

**Coase Theorem**

Where you put liability doesn't matter for the outcome that you reach (right party will use right technology to get rid of harm) if no transaction costs.

When the Coase theorem could work:

● If they know each other and can work out best allocation, doesn't matter where you put burden 20

o School and factory hypo: if the injunction is put on factory, factory will pay school to build fan to get rid of pollution; if no injunction, school will pay for fan to get rid of pollution law doesn't matter; **OUTCOME WILL BE THE SAME**

Critiques/when it doesn't work:

● Transaction costs

● Doesn't account for people wanting to hold onto what they have

● Information asymmetry -- they don't know who is the least cost avoider ● They can't bargain can't leave it to the parties to work it out; so the court needs to argue about where to put legal right (least cost avoider, other aims)

● Diffuse public interests -- who'll negotiate on behalf of a public harm? Free rider problem dissuades anyone from acting

o

**Remedies**

**[Deciding Between Injunctions and Damages]{.underline}**

Has implications for who sets the price for the right to decide whether the activity continues.

eBay Test for Permanent Injunctions (equitable relief): Plaintiff must demonstrate that 1. It has suffered an irreparable injury

a\. eBay: no irreparable injury to MercExchange

2\. Remedies available at law (i.e., monetary damages) are inadequate to compensate for that injury a. eBay: damages are an adequate remedy for MercExchange

3\. Considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted AND

a\. eBay: balance of the hardships favors neither party

4\. The public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.

a\. eBay: public interest weighs slightly against injunction

i\. Type of patent involved: this is a '265 business method patent that combines "non-unique elements into a unique combination;" this type of patent is often of questionable nature; this particular patent has not yet had its second review

b\. "While preserving the integrity of the patent system will always be a consideration in the public interest analysis, it cannot be allowed to dominate such analysis lest a

presumption results."

Standard of review on appeal: abuse of discretion

**[Compensatory Damages]{.underline}**

Paying for the injury.

**Calculations**

Calculating compensatory damages is similar to analyzing causation in that you're comparing to a counterfactual.

When compensatory damages are calculated with reference to the average earnings/income of similar people, you can **[perpetuate societal discrimination/inequalities]{.underline}**.

California statute sacrifices some accuracy/specificity for the sake of broader social values.

***Lost Chance Doctrine***

● compensatory damages include 100% of pain and suffering (which wouldn't have happened without doctor's intervention)

● and x% of what he lost the chance of avoiding (even though he may have suffered this anyway, doctor is only responsible for x lost chance)

o Lost earnings

o Death-related/funeral costs

o Pain and suffering associated with death

**Vicarious Liability**

Employer can possibly be held **[vicariously responsible for compensatory damages]{.underline}** if their employee did something wrong in the scope of employment.

**[Punitive Damages]{.underline}**

For the most part, punitive damages are not about filling gaps in compensatory damages. i.e., might need punitive damages to achieve optimal deterrence (or get all the way to absolute) ![](media/image5.png){width="2.5in" height="2.59375in"}

***Exxon v. Baker***

● When might you want to increase punitive damages?

o When higher penalties are available for behavior that's more than negligent ▪ **Recklessness** often makes defendant eligible for punitive damages; sometimes even **gross negligence** makes the defendant eligible

● (Meanings are disputed)

● Gross Negligence: really really really negligent (relative to the

reasonable person)

o Still an objective standard

23

● Recklessness: different from gross negligence; there is a subjective

component -- you knew or should have known of unreasonable risk of

physical harm and then disregarded the risk

o Restatement quoted in BP opinion:

o Multiplier theory: increase punishment when the activity is hard to detect to capture harm defendant wasn't caught for

o **Absolute deterrence** = never want the harm to happen ever

▪ vs. **optimal deterrence** = perfectly internalize costs so people can decide

whether the harm is worth it by balancing precaution and harm costs

● Compensatory damages aim to serve optimal deterrence

● Offers idea of applying [vicarious liability]{.underline} to punitive damages

o Case for employer paying punitive damages: they're more capable of paying punitive damages, whereas employee might not have the funds; incentivizes employer

monitoring employees' sobriety/ability to work safely

o Case against employer paying punitive damages: if employer can't control the employee, there's no use incentivizing monitoring

● Sets a **1:1 ratio cap** on punitive to compensatory damages

o Disparities in the application of punitive damages can look arbitrary

o No special circumstances here that justify multiplier theory

**Due Process Limitations on Punitive Damages**

Need to prevent grossly excessive punitive damages

Jury decides damages and then judge reviews it, and might impose a ratio at that point.

***BMW v. Gore -- SCOTUS***

Three guideposts:

1\. Degree of reprehensibility of defendant's misconduct

2\. Disparity between actual / potential harm suffered by plaintiff and punitive damages award 3. Comparison between punitive damages awarded by jury and civil penalties in comparable cases a. (if they're similar, it's probably not such a lack of notice that it violates due process) b. Note: no one really knows how to use this guidepost

> ***State Farm v. Campbell -- SCOTUS***

145:1 ratio between punitive and compensatory was too much. **Should probably be pretty limited to 9:1 ratio**. Some wiggle room but not exactly sure how much -- maybe if compensatory damages are exceptionally low, hard to prove harm, or they had a low chance of being detected

***Philip Morris v. Williams -- SCOTUS***

● Issue: can juries punish defendants for harm to nonparties? (where can reprehensibility come into the jury's analysis?)

● Holding:

o Juries CAN consider substantial harm to the public in determining something is reprehensible

o Juries CANNOT use harm to nonparties to punish a defendant directly / inform damages 24

**[Limits on Damages]{.underline}**

Note: we didn't really talk about limits on injunctions

These limits cut off economic recovery

**No Duty: Artificial Limits from Common Law on Purely Economic and Purely Emotional Loss**

No duty cuts off liability; doesn't get to jury.

Tort law can cut your ability to recover on **[purely economic loss]{.underline}** by drawing arbitrary lines (i.e., *physical damage vs. no physical damage* in 532 Madison Ave v. Finlandia and in Beck & Dunlop cases -- the property that was hit by rocks can recovery purely economic loss).

How do you get around this bright line, common law, judge-made rule? A statute might be written to override it.

Recovery for **[purely emotional loss]{.underline}** is limited in a similar way: whether they can collect on pain and suffering is entirely dependent on *whether or not they suffered physical injury to their person*. So pain and suffering recovery is essentially the same as pure emotional loss.

**Statutory Limits**

These constrain the discretion of the fact finder.

1\. Statutory damages

a\. Pro-plaintiff: guarantees at least some damages

b\. e.g., Copyright Act gives you the option to

i\. prove how much damages you should get OR

ii\. get guaranteed damages within a certain range as long as you've shown

infringement

2\. Statutory cap

a\. Pro-defendant

b\. Usually implemented as caps on pain and suffering

c\. May be set through a multiplier or dollar amount

[d. Discussion:]{.mark}

[i. Maybe a cap sends the message that defendant, especially if wealthy, can just]{.mark} [pay for harm and continue activity (which isn't absolute deterrence)]{.mark}

[ii. Maybe we don't want punitive damages to be tied to the harm]{.mark}

[1. i.e., moral luck made the harm small but the behavior was absolutely]{.mark}

[egregious so we want to deter it]{.mark}

25

**Mass Torts**

**[Class Actions]{.underline}**

**Certification**

Judge decides whether necessary criteria were met

● **FRCP 23(a) threshold requirements**: certified party must meet (1) numerosity, (2) law/fact commonality, (3) claim/defenses typicality, AND (4) adequacy

● **FRCP 23(b) -- class needs to satisfy at least one**: plaintiffs can define their class as (1)(A) incompatible (don't want defendant to get conflicting order from court for similar facts), (1)(B) limited fund \[defendant'll run out of money\], (2) injunctive, AND/OR (3) predominant / superior (damages)

o Different types/reasons for class actions

● **FRCP 23(c)(4) issue classes:** plaintiffs are certified on particular issues (which helps get around the heightened b3 requirements because it essentially guarantees that common issues will predominate and class action will be superior at least on these issues)

o NOTE: Theoretically the individualized damages will then be determined later, but practically it's likely that a settlement will happen. Avoiding individualized damages may make [skirting the formal commonality requirements from Walmart more palatable and]{.underline} [is good for court's efficiency.]{.underline}

o **Broad view of c4**: courts apply the 23(b)(3) predominance and superiority prongs AFTER the issue class has been identified; permits class certification on those issues even when predominance has not been satisfied for the entire case. (Martin v. Behr Dayton -- 6^th^ circ)

▪ **Compared to narrow view**, which prohibits issue classes if predominance wasn't satisfied for the entire case.

▪ Justification: Doesn't make sense if you have to certify under 23b3 before

breaking into issue classes because then what's the point of c4?

▪ Then each plaintiff can sue individually to prove individual injuries if they want (but usually they settle before this)

o Note: still have to meet 23a and 23b requirements for issue classes

▪ Issue class could be certified as 23b2 and the additional b2 requirements apply (as long as you're under broad view). This doesn't come up much though.

● The standard of review on appeals of class certification is clear abuse of discretion (Martin v. Behr Dayton)

**Settlements**

Note: pooling resources in class actions can help resist pressure to settle too soon Members of class can opt out or object if they don't like terms of settlement

Settlements avoid making individualized damages determinations

● Avoiding individualized damages is good for court's efficiency since it's a huge time sink. ● Avoiding individualized damages may make skirting the formal commonality requirements from Walmart more palatable.

**Compensation funds**:

Can be a form of settlement, or can be made separate from the settlement (BP) Administrator divides it up w/individualized assessments.

Usually from a set pool of money but not always.

Benefit: more efficient for administrator to do individualized assessments; can compensate for harms that wouldn't otherwise be considered (i.e., emotional loss in 9/11 fund)

**23(e)(2) settlements**:

Judges has to approve settlement for due process concerns

Must be FAIR, REASONABLE, ADEQUATE

***NFL Settlement***

● Two unique terms of this settlement:

o Plaintiffs don't have to prove causation to get money

▪ It's hard to prove causation re brain injuries, let alone diagnose them while the victim is still alive

▪ Lowers burden of proof on players

o There's no cap on the total amount of money to be paid by defendants; they'll have to keep paying as long as players make claims

▪ This helps address concern that parties who are currently injured will get all the money before injuries show up in players that don't know they have the

condition yet

**[Multi-District Litigation]{.underline}**

Compared to class actions:

● Very similar to 23c4 issue classes

o Both sent back for individualized determinations at the end of deciding common stuff ▪ And both usually settle before this happens

o Both are aggregate

● Differences

o Class actions are REPRESENTATIVE; MDLs are not -- each plaintiff has their own lawyer o Issue classes can have trials, but MDLs are remanded before that (can't have trials together)

**Settlements**

MDL settlements are opt-in settlements.

MDLs are supposed to go back to their home federal courts for individualized damage calculation, but realistically they usually settle before that happens.

***Vioxx***

● Early, "**bellweather cases**" played out badly for plaintiffs

27

o Judge took a few cases and remanded them to test how much those claims are worth (get an average). These informed settlement. Plaintiffs saw their claims might not be worth much so they settled for less.

● Terms of settlement said that 85% of plaintiffs had to sign onto the settlement / opt in for it to be valid (otherwise it's not worth it for defendant to pay out)

***BP Oil Spill -- 5^th^ Circuit***

● March opinion

o Importance: Compromises you make it settlement about what proof is sufficient can't feed back and ruin certification.

● January opinion:

o A4: Because there's no cap, there's no interclass conflict between uninjured and injured people because everyone will get money

o A2: Walmart means same injurious conduct/act by defendant, not literally the same injury.

▪ We just need a common contention that if true would be answered by the same answer.

● Don't bring in proof of those contentions at the certification stage. We

always know that some people in class won't be able to prove injury and

that's fine.

o B3: other circuits allow c4 broad view; this looks like that so it's fine
