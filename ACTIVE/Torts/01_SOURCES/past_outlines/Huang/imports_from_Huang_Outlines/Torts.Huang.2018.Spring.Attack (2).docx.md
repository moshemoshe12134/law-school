**Torts Spring 2018**

# Issue Spotter Attack

# Forms of Action

## Individual Action

- Standard litigation without large number of joined plaintiffs.

## Mass Tort

### Class Action

#### Requirements for all classes \[23(a)\]

- [Numerosity]{.underline} (joinder impracticable)

- [Commonality]{.underline} (common question of law or fact); Posner: use subclasses or sub-issues

  - *[Walmart]{.underline}* (Scalia majority): Mere pleading of common question is insufficient; there must be "same injury," "common answer," "glue."

    - Look for: single actor (e.g. same manager, regional manager), single test, or particular policy, single store?

    - Dissimilarities of parties impede generation of common answers.

  - *[Parko]{.underline}*: Posner says focus on single source of injury, even if injuries are not the same

  - *[Sears]{.underline}*: Posner says damages don't need to be common or predominate because we can use sub-classes and issue classes: certify the common issue and do damages later

- [Typicality]{.underline} (claims or defenses of representative parties typical of claims or defenses of the class)

- [Adequate representation]{.underline} (representative party will fairly and adequately protect class' interest)

#### Types of classes \[23(b)\]

- **[Need AT LEAST ONE of:]{.underline}**

- [Limited funds/inconsistency]{.underline}: limited pool for recovery or incompatible legal standards

  - Notice mandatory, cannot drop out

- [Injunctive class]{.underline}: plaintiffs seek injunctive or declaratory relief; remedy would itself affect entire class

  - Must show: D acted or refused to act on ground applying generally to class (common practice)

  - Notice not mandatory

- [Damages class]{.underline}: (most common and controversial; most difficult to certify)

  - Requirements:

    - Common issues [predominate]{.underline}

    - Class action is superior to alternative methods for fairly & efficiently adjudicating controversy

    - Mandatory notice & opt-out mechanism

  - All non-incidental money damages have to be brought here (*[Wal-Mart v. Dukes]{.underline}*)

#### Procedural Safeguards

- Interlocutory Appeal: can appeal certification decision immediately (FRCP 23(f))---efficiency)

- Class certification denial not preclusive: individuals can try to re-certify a different class over and over

#### Issue Classes & Subclasses

- [23(c)(4) - Sub-classes]{.underline}: break class actions into sub-classes later (different washing machine makes & geographies, etc.)

- [23(c)(3) - Issue class]{.underline}: certify issues that are common, take out non-common issues, then after common issues are decided, court can decertify the class and let them settle the rest of the cases individually

  - In practice, if issue is at all important, a win at trial (or even potentially certification) will prompt settlement

#### Class Action Settlements

- [Requires judicial approval]{.underline}

  - Example: NFL concussion case, judge did not approve settlement until compensation cap removed

- [Requires notice and fairness hearing]{.underline}: where judge may decide that agreement is unfair and 3rd-parties can also object to it, providing some adversarial elements.

  - The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal

  - If the proposal would bind class members, it requires a fairness hearing

  - Any class member may object

  - The parties seeking approval must file a statement identifying any agreement made in connection with the proposal (including side deals)

  - If the class action was previously certified under Rule 23(b)(3) \[damages class\], the court may refuse to approve a settlement unless it affords a new opportunity to request exclusion (opt-out) to individual class members who had an earlier opportunity to request exclusion but did not do so

### Multi-District Litigation

- MDL committee (standing panel of federal judges) examines cases with common issues, consolidates for judge and district

- Once consolidated, court will find all common facts; cases subsequently broken up and sent back

  - In reality: people settle

- CANNOT dispose entire case, so no common remedy (e.g. no big damages award for everyone) and no global peace

  - Findings of fact not binding if people opt out

- [Example]{.underline}

  - *[In re Deepwater Horizon]{.underline}*: Started as MDL, but BP agreed to a Settlement Agreement and class certification of all the cases - wanted global peace

    - BP subsequently regretted: uncapped compensation fund, no causation requirement

# Theories of Liability

## Strict Liability

- [When Applicable]{.underline}?

  - Abnormally dangerous activity

  - Trespass; or

  - Vicarious liability (one party is responsible for the actions of another, e.g. *respondeat superior*)

- [Abnormally dangerous factors (2nd Restatement):]{.underline}

  - High degree of risk of some harm

  - Likelihood that harm will be great

  - Inability to eliminate the risk by exercise of reasonable care

    - *[American Cyanamid]{.underline}*: Could just fix the tank

  - Extent to which activity is not a matter of common usage

    - (Can be framed -- to people/area/industry)

  - Inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on

  - Value to the community of the activity

- [Choosing strict liability or negligence]{.underline}

  - [Negligence]{.underline} alters care levels

    - If you can take more care to eliminate risk you are in the world of negligence

  - [Strict liability]{.underline} alters activity levels

    - If you cannot eliminate the risk with more care, you are in the world of SL

  - Huang: Negligence acts like strict liability on the plaintiff unless the defendant is negligent

  - Consider if party is [cheapest cost avoider]{.underline} - if so points to SL

- [Animals (origin of doctrine)]{.underline}

  - Highly vicious? If yes, then strict liability

  - Non-vicious animal? If yes, then no negligence

    - One-bite rule: once it bites someone, you know it's dangerous

  - Consider: is animal causing injury as animal? (or as football thrown across the street?)

- [How to argue against SL without conceding negligence]{.underline}

  - Argue that SL is inappropriate because care level sufficient to prevent harm

  - Then argue that appropriate care levels will never *completely* preclude possibility of harm, and that harm here was very unlikely

## Negligence Per Se (statutory negligence)

- Is there a law?

  - Statutory purpose exception: Plaintiff was not class of persons or did not suffer type of harm intended to be protected by statute

    - If violation of the statute does not increase the risk of harm to those in the plaintiff's situation, the courts are unlikely to hold the plaintiff to be an intended beneficiary

    - However: Courts are likely to read statute's protection broadly to include indirect injuries

- Was it breached?

  - Can still be negligent if you didn't breach law - law may set low bar for minimal care

- If applies and breached possible exceptions

  - Necessity, following statute more dangerous (Tedla), incapacity (children) and emergency; or statute completely irrelevant (P by any stretch of imagination not intended)

## Reasonable Person Negligence

### Duty

- Implied -- you created the risk ("launch instrument of destruction")

  - Don't waste time talking about duty in normal negligence case

- Affirmative -- even if you did not create the risk

  - Duty to warn

    - Informed Consent

      - Consider [reasonable patient standard]{.underline} (what patient would want to know) vs. [reasonable physician standard]{.underline} (what info reasonable doctor would provide)

    - Products Liability - manufacturers must provide adequate warning of foreseeable risks

      - Juries decide adequacy

      - Look to feasibility; costs of providing warning; kinds of information purchasers want/need

      - Consider "label clutter"

  - Special relationship (also maybe duty to warn, *Tarasoff*)

    - Contractual duties

    - Family

    - Undertaking a rescue (no general duty to rescue, but if you make an attempt you must conduct non-negligently)

  - Good Samaritan law (Vermont)

- No duty -- even if you *did* create the risk

  - Pure economic harm

  - Pure emotional harm

- Creating a duty

  - Foreseeability and extent of plaintiff's harm

  - Policy reasons: ability to pay, deterrence value, fairness, etc

- [Tension in the tort system regarding BPL analysis -- to what extent is it important to consider societal risks vs. the risk to the particular plaintiffs?]{.underline}

### Breach

#### Shortcuts

- Custom

  - Not dispositive; consider setting industry standards

  - Evidence of compliance may be used [defensively]{.underline} to show reasonable care

  - Evidence of non-compliance may be used [offensively]{.underline} to prove negligence

- Malpractice

  - Mandatory, and create safe harbor if met

  - Exceptions:

    - Fail but alternative school of thought

    - Comply but average layperson knows N (wrong foot)

#### Reasonable person standard

- Objective v. subjective? (BUT: Under the Circumstances')

  - Objective: doing adult activity, mental infirmities, gender (RPS, objective, external)

  - Subjective: expertise, common carriers, physical infirmities (individualized)

  - Semi-objective: children (may consider age, intelligence)

  - No liability: infants \< 4

  - Emergency doctrine: When in an emergency not of your own making you only need to show honest exercise of judgment

- "Untaken precautions" (if didn't take one worth taking, there is negligence)

#### BPL (Learned Hand formula)

- [Untaken precautions]{.underline} (if didn't take one that was worth taking, that's negligence)

  - [Burden]{.underline} (B) of adequate/additional precautions

  - [Magnitude]{.underline} of loss (L) (versus loss if precaution taken)

  - [Probability]{.underline} (P) that a particular act or omission will cause harm (% after 'added precaution' -- %before 'added precaution')

  - Ideal formula: compare B with (P~\~B~ -- P~B~) × (L~\~B~ -- L~B~), where terms are defined w/r/t their foreseeability

- [Restatement Third]{.underline}

  - Person acts negligently if the person does not exercise reasonable care under all the circumstances

    - Primary factors to consider in ascertaining whether the person's conduct lacks reasonable care are

- [Consider]{.underline}

  - Difference between foreseeability and probability

    - Someone [could]{.underline} be injured, but will they?

  - BPL on the [precaution taken]{.underline}-- precaution 1) won't always work, 2) won't prevent [all]{.underline} harm?

# Causation

## Cause-in-fact

### But-for causation

- Would the plaintiff's injury have occurred [but for]{.underline} the negligent act of the defendant?

- Finding that, more likely than not, defendant's actions were prerequisite, yes to CIF

- This does not establish liability, just possibility

<!-- -->

- Multiple necessary causes

  - That's fine.Can be multiple cause-in-fact

- Multiple sufficient negligent causes

  - But-for is under-inclusive

  - Each liable

  - 4 negligently-set fires converging on house. If each burns it down, each is a cause-in-fact, although not a but-for cause

- [Multiple sufficient causes]{.underline}, one negligent and one not

  - Negligent is liable only if initial factual cause of injury

  - Non-negligently set one arrives first? No liability for either

- [Preemptive causation with multiple negligent actors]{.underline}: Complicated

  - Only first negligent actor bears responsibility. No liability for theoretical harm

    - Moral luck!

    - But damages are different...

  - I run into you with my car and break your leg. However, you have terminal cancer and only a few months to live. But-for the car accident, you would have a whole leg

    - I bear full [liability]{.underline} for the broken leg, under the but-for theory of causation, pre-empting the plane crash theory of causation

    - However, the [damages]{.underline} award takes into account the fact that you only have a few months to live, reducing the damages award

## Proof problems

- [Alternative liability]{.underline} (*Summers v. Tice*: Two hunters negligently shoot, but who injured plaintiff?)

  - Need to be certain that at least one of the parties caused the harm

  - Shifts burden of proof to the defendants, they then prove themselves out of liability

  - Useful for dealing with asymmetric information (defendants know better)

  - If at least one actor definitely at fault, more fair to plaintiff (can't escape due to other actors' negligent acts)

- [Market share liability]{.underline} (*Sindell v. Abbott Lab*: Pregnant women getting sick with pills that look the same): impose liability in proportion to market share;

  - Requires: signature disease, identical product, market, etc.

    - Uncommon because very few actual signature diseases

  - Types:

    - Relative (take share of market, overpay) or;

    - Absolute (D only accountable for actual share)

  - Note: Some courts have allowed plaintiffs who *can* prove a particular defendant caused their injury (i.e. they know who produced the pill) to opt-out of MSL

## Harm

### Loss of chance

> (*Herskovits*): Physician negligent, decedent dies, but only had 39% chance of death anyway, with misdiagnosis pushing to 25%)

- Harm is redefined as lost chance of survival rather than death

- Theory of causation but [also]{.underline} recovery

  - Calculation: decreased chance of survival (must die)

  - If \<50% survival prior to negligent act, not a but-for cause

- Only applies where likelihood of survival less than 50% even without negligent action; otherwise, but-for causation applies

- [Policy: but why not the rate? Taking from 20% to 10% is much worse than 40% to 30%! But same amount of money!]{.underline}

## Proximate cause

### [Foreseeability]{.underline} (traditional)

- Was the harm caused a [foreseeable result]{.underline} of the defendant's actions?

  - *Example*: Defendant fails to stop at a red light, hits defendant's car. He's negligent, and his failure to stop is a cause-in-fact of the harm, but were his actions the "proximate cause?"

    - Obviously. Completely foreseeable outcome.

- May we impose liability if [unforeseeable]{.underline}?

  - [Plaintiff]{.underline}: No

    - Defendant shouldn't be held liable for injuries caused to wholly unforeseeable plaintiff, even if negligent act and cause-in-fact

    - *Palsgraf v. LIRR*

      - "Maybe negligent to knock the package onto the tracks, could hurt someone. But not [that]{.underline} someone."

  - [Extent of harm]{.underline}: Yes

    - "Eggshell plaintiff doctrine": Must take the plaintiff as you find him

    - Administrability, fairness, promotion of deterrence

  - [Type of harm]{.underline}: No

    - *Restatement Third*: Defendant drops shotgun on the toe of the plaintiff

      - Negligent harm inflicted with a gun, but not the kind of harm we're worried about

  - [Manner of harm]{.underline}: Yes

    - Category not very clear, but Abraham: if the plaintiff, injury, and its nature are foreseeable, the fact that it occurred it in a weird way does not bar recovery

      - *Example*: Defendant's negligent driving causes a car accident; plaintiff gets out, third car comes by and hits him. Original defendant still liable

  - Manner -- doesn't matter (car skidding)

### [Harm within the risk]{.underline} (Modern Restatement)

- 1\) Did the plaintiff's actions [increase the risk]{.underline} that the harm would occur; and 2) is it something that we're trying to prevent?

  - *Example*: Defendant parks his car next to a fire hydrant. Plaintiff's car skids on the road, collides with his parked car.

    - Defendant is [clearly negligent]{.underline}, and his decision to park next to the hydrant is a cause in fact of the damage to the vehicle.

    - However, fails the harm within the risk test

      - Parking next to the hydrant rather than 12 feet further down the street could prevent firefighters from getting access to the hydrant

      - But it didn't increase the risk of the accident!

    - Negligence because he could *[shoot himself]{.underline}*! No liability

- "Would we expect/want the defendant to consider this risking when making the decision?"

  - Sometimes consider "secondary purpose" of a statute

  - *Example*: Statute requires railroad company to put up a fence blocking access to the tracks.

    - Legislative history suggests concern about livestock wandering onto the tracks

    - However, a child walks onto tracks and is injured

  - *Gorris v. Scott*: Sheep washed overboard, no pens (statutory requirement). But not harm within the risk - statute was to prevent contagious diseases from spreading

- [Facts can be dispositive]{.underline}

  - Small change in facts can lead to completely different outcomes

    - *Example*: Convenience store owner in an exclusive, gated community. Sandy trips in a poorly-lit parking lot, fracturing skull. She sues, arguing that Arthur should have had a light

      - If owner is found negligent, he's probably liable: this is a clear harm within the risk

    - *Example*: Same facts, but Sandy is mugged. Assume violent crimes are very rare in this area

      - Good chance owner is not liable [as a matter of law]{.underline}-- many jurisdictions hesitant to impose liability for failing to protect others from the risk of criminal attack

# Liability of Others

## Plaintiff

- Contributory N (old): plaintiff must be non-negligent to recover

  - Any negligence by P, no matter how small, bars recovery

- Comparative N (new)

  - Assign liability between P and D if P is also N

  - Types

    - Pure: liability in direct proportion to fault in all cases (common, 33)

    - Partial: apportions based on fault until P's negligence \>= D, then barred from recovery (13 states)

## Third Parties (Allocation of Damages)

### Types of Joint & Several liability

+================================+==========================================================================+====================================================================================+=========================================================================================================+===================================================================================+

- Use when more than one N non-plaintiff party

  - Alternative Liability if more than one party left in as liable

  - Joint Tortfeasors

    - If actors engage in a joint enterprise (e.g., a business partnership) and one is negligent, then the actors are each liable up to the full amount of the relevant obligation (joint & several liability applies)

  - Independent Tortfeasors

    - Are jointly and severally liable for

      - A single, theoretically indivisible harm (ex. two vehicles collide and one runs onto a sidewalk, injuring a pedestrian), and for

      - A single, theoretically divisible but practically indivisible harm

# Remedies

## Damages

### Compensatory

- Can get for:

  - Physical

  - Emotional when accompanied by physical

  - Pain and suffering

  - Economic when accompanied by physical

- Can't get for:

  - Pain and suffering of others

  - Pure emotional or economic harm

### Punitive

- Purposes

  - Retribution

    - Scaled in proportion to reprehensibility

  - Deterrence

    - Absolute deterrence

    - Optimal deterrence (probabilistic)

- Limitations

  - Constitutional due process standard (*State Farm*): \~10:1

  - *Exxon* maritime: 1:1

### Statutory damages

- "Concurrent damages"

- Example: treble damages for antitrust

## Injunctive relief

- Four factors:

  - Suffered irreparable harm

  - Remedies at law are inadequate to compensate

  - Balance of hardships between P & D (is injunction warranted)

  - Public interest (is it disserved by granting injunction?)

## Mention bargaining/Coase?

# Property torts?

## Trespass (Strict Liability)

### Elements

- Entry → anything fits, including intangibles (bacteria?)

- Harm → not necessary (presumptive invasion of ownership feelings); BUT if no injury→nominal damages

- Intent → only need intent to enter land; NOT intent to enter someone else's land (no intent → negligence)

### Defenses to trespass

- Necessity Exceptions

- Private necessity: qualified/conditional defense (must compensate)

  - When: risk to one party's property only, who can reduce/eliminate risk by damaging someone else's

  - Liability: D liable to P for damage to P's property; privilege conditioned on P later compensating

  - Incentivizes cheapest cost avoidance calculation (deterrence)

- Public necessity: absolute defense (no compensation)

  - When: risk to property of many ('public') can be reduced by damaging property of D

## Conversion

- (Like Trespass but personal property -- we didn't really talk about in class)

- **Elements**:

  - P owns real property

  - Wrongful deprivation (D deprives P or property; must be permanent/indefinite; not giving back)

  - Unauthorized conduct by D (did not have P's permission)

  - Harm or injury (damages = full value of good converted + loss of extra profits OR return of property)

## Nuisance

- **Definition:** A [substantial]{.underline} and [unreasonable]{.underline} interference with the right of an owner or occupier of land to the [use and enjoyment]{.underline} of the land (ex. air pollution)

  - Reasonableness: balancing the value of competing landowner's activities

  - Activity is unreasonable if the social harm of DF's activity o/w social utility

    - See below for factors for each

- **Public Nuisance:**

  - Not a tort, but a low-level quasi-criminal offense that affects the public

- **Private nuisance**: Must be substantial and unreasonable interference with another's interest:

  - Restatement:§822: one is subject to liability for conduct that is a legal cause of an invasion of another's interest in the private use and enjoyment of land if the invasion is either

    - Intentional and unreasonable, or

    - Unintentional and arising out of negligent or reckless conduct or abnormally dangerous conditions or activities

  - Intentional

    - Situations in which there is knowledge that the conduct is invading, or is substantially certain to invade, another's interest in the use and enjoyment of land

  - Intentional use Unreasonable if:

    - the gravity of the harm outweighs the utility of the actor's conduct, or

    - the harm caused by the conduct is serious and the financial burden of compensating for this and similar harm to others would not make the continuation of the conduct not feasible

- **Factors for gravity of harm**

  - Extent of harm involved

  - Character of harm

  - Social value the law attaches to the type of use or enjoyment invaded

  - Suitability of particular use or enjoyment to the character of the locality

  - Burden on the person harmed or avoiding the harm

- **Factors for utility of conduct constituting intentional invasion**

  - The social value that the law attaches to the primary purpose of the conduct

  - The suitability of the conduct to the character of the locality

  - The impracticability of preventing or avoiding the invasion

**Policy**

# Key features of tort law

## Jury trial

- Right to trial by jury in all tort cases (state and federal)

## Liability insurance

- Today virtually all defendants in personal injury and property damage suits have at least some liability insurance

## Contingent fee system

- Plaintiff's attorney receives percentage of the recovery if suit successful and charges nothing if suit unsuccessful

## "American rule" for costs

- Each party pays own costs including counsel fees win or lose

  - Plaintiffs less discouraged from bringing the suit because no risk of incurring sizeable personal cost if lose (contingent fee, don't pay defendant's attorney)

- Defendants must even if they win

# Aims of Tort Law 

## Corrective Justice

> → Restoring moral balance (injustice corrected): focuses on morality by compensating to balance moral wrongdoing from tortfeasors and vindicating plaintiff's rights

- Less applicable with faceless corporations and liability insurance; served by rendering P whole

## Civil Recourse

> → Provide victims recourse for civil wrongs & recognition: focus on process of compensating in order to give plaintiffs way of getting an answer through civil system

- Imposing liability recognizes the occurrence of a wrongfully caused injury and vindicates the victim's need for recognition that they have been wronged.

## Optimal Deterrence

> → deters excessively risky activity so only losses worth avoiding are avoided

- Deterring certain losses is not worth what it would take to deter them.

- Only considers economic values---ignores human values/ pain and suffering from accident...

## Absolute Deterrence

> → Stopping activity

## Loss Distribution

> → spread the risk, who has insurance, who can distribute loss

- Does not satisfy sense of moral blame; tort law expensive mechanism for distributing losses

- Specific deterrence: regulations to control behavior (bans)

- General deterrence: Increases the price of certain activities, such as a carbon tax

## Compensation

> → return the victim to their original state; promote compensation for sufferer: focus on the plaintiff because they have suffered a loss through no fault of their own.

- Why not: desirability of providing compensation to a particular class of injury victims rarely explains the lines that are drawn to distinguish those who are and those who are not entitled to prevail in a tort claim.

- Instead: Liability not imposed to provide compensation to victims. Rather, they are provided compensation to serve other goals of tort law---corrective justice and deterrence

## Social Welfare

> → Safety for society, activity is necessary

## Redress of social grievances

> → right to sue in tort promotes redress of social grievances (v. faceless corp.)

- In this view, tort law is a populist mechanism permitting ordinary people to put authority on trial

# Competing Aims

- Deterrence (defendant-based) v. Compensation (plaintiff-based)

- Blameworthiness (defendant-based) v. Fairness (plaintiff-based)

- Risk-spreading (defendant-based) v. Social welfare (plaintiff-based)

# Questions of Tort Law

## Who Decides?

### Courts v. Legislatures

- [Legislatures]{.underline} → Institutional competence; better information and more research?; democratic decisions; more trust and legitimacy?

- [Court]{.underline} → Incremental change; creates change case-by-case

### Judge v. Jury

- **Judge** (law) → experience; knowledge of rules; consistency; individual biases

- **Jury** (fact) → democratic; expertise?; reflect societal preferences/expectations; inconsistent; unpredictable?

### Methods

- Court leaves to legislature → follows case precedent, no new law

- Court acts over legislature → interprets statute to give courts more leeway

## Rules v. standards?

- **Rules**: constraining and rigid → Holmes (get out of car)

  - [Pros]{.underline}: predictable/consistent; clear/concrete; effective deterrence; easily administered; uniform-fair?; produce settlements

  - [Cons]{.underline}: arbitrary cutoffs are harsh; inflexible; over/under-inclusive; ignores reasons/nuances; hard to carve out exceptions; susceptible to manipulations

- **Standards**: flexible and discretionary → Cardozo (reasonable driver)

  - [Pros]{.underline}: fairness/tailored to fact; flexible-permit judicial discretion; permit exceptions based on circumstances; individual justice; resilient to societal changes; 'justice' considerations; extra-deterrence (from boundaries)

  - [Cons]{.underline}: less clarity/guidance; unpredictable; inconsistent results; institutional competence?; expensive; bias

- **Convergence theory** (Schauer): adaptive behavior pushes them together

# Economic Theories

## Cheapest Cost Avoider I (best knowledge)

- Stick liability on person who:

  - Knows risk/harms (who will be hurt and to what extent)

  - Knows the available precautions

  - Knows the tort law (needs to know what they are liable for)

- Problems

  - Morality; blameworthiness; social norms; distribution; ignores risk spreading; no stability because person stuck w/ liability depends on volatile factors like technology

## Cheapest Cost Avoider II (best bargainer)

- Best briber is one who faces lowest transaction costs, based on Coase Theorem

- Factors: (1) who knows risk; (2) who knows how to reduce risks? (3) who knows when they're liability

## Coase Theorem

> **→** If no transaction costs irrelevant where liability is placed

- Purpose of law? Contracting around the law

- Criticism: Ignores distributional consequences

  - But state can consider distribution in initial assignment of entitlements

# Other Aims to (Potentially) Consider

- Too speculative

- Limited resources

- Floodgates of litigation

- Medical/Technological Limitations

  - "We can't find out exactly who is injured by the BP oil spill"

- Huge burden, outweigh benefits

- Stunt progress/advancements

**Doctrine List**

# Alternative liability

- *Summers v. Tice*: Classic case of "alternative" liability, imposing liability on negligent defendants, each of whom is equally likely to have harmed the plaintiff

- Burden-shifting: defendants must prove they were *not* the guilty party

- Alternative to AL: plaintiff bears burden of proof (as in standard tort actions)

- Justifications:

  - Allows plaintiffs to recover in circumstances where they can narrow down defendants

  - Helps solve asymmetric information problem - defendants incentivized to testify against each other

    - But won't the actual tortfeasor just lie?

# Joint-and-several liability

- Each defendant is liable for the whole harm

- Imposed in three situations:

  - Defendants are [joint tortfeasors]{.underline}, i.e. engaging in the activity together

  - Independent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for a [single, theoretically indivisible harm]{.underline}

    - One defendant speeds through an intersection, other fails to stop at red light -- they collide and one runs onto the sidewalk, injuring pedestrian

      - Under but-for causation, each one is cause-in-fact of the pedestrian's injuries, because neither alone would be sufficient

  - Independent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for a [single, theoretically divisible but practically indivisible]{.underline} harm

    - Example -- one defendant's negligence leads to collision with plaintiff's vehicle, second caused a second collision. Theoretically could divide the harm up between the two vehicles, but practically it's impossible to tell who damaged what with the car

- Justifications:

  - One or more of the defendants may be insolvent or otherwise impossible to collect from

    - Imposing joint and several liability shifts the burden onto the *[defendants]{.underline}* for the insolvency, not the plaintiff

  - If we have an innocent plaintiff and negligent or otherwise liable defendants, plaintiff for fairness reasons should be able to recover, then force the defendants to figure out how to collect from the insolvent defendant

# Eggshell plaintiff

- Current Rule: D is liable for all the harm caused to P, even if he's especially frail

  - "Take the victim as you find him"

- Alternative: D is liable only for foreseeable/ "normal" harms

- Justifications:

  - [Administrability]{.underline}: Lacking the rule, plaintiff in every single case would have to prove that injuries were "foreseeable" and "normal

  - [Fairness]{.underline}: Defendant wronged the plaintiff; appropriate that the defendant bears the risk that his negligence will cause more harm than foreseeable

  - [Desirable kind of strict liability]{.underline}: Individuals vary enormously in the degree to which they are weak or strong, so defendant who can foresee the risk must know that there is a distribution of severity

    - Defendants capture the upside of unusually strong plaintiffs, so they should bear liability for unusually weak plaintiffs

- This promotes optimal deterrence

# Custom

- Current Rule: admissible as evidence, but not determinative

- Alternatives: determinative or irrelevant

- Justifications

  - Normative force -- "Definitionally, 'reasonableness' is what everyone else in my position does, and I did that"

    - Based on experience and authority that comes from a widespread way of doing things, custom may be probative of what constitutes reasonable care

    - Holding someone liable for doing what everyone else does seems unfair

    - That said, want to demonstrate that the custom is actually justified on the merits, rather than just asserted based on authority

  - Proper cost-benefit analysis, etc

    - Admitting evidence of compliance with custom cautions the jury that if it finds that an actor was negligent despite compliance with the custom, the jury is holding [everyone]{.underline} in that industry negligent

    - Inverse: if defendant wasn't in compliance with the industry standard, he's an outsider and that seems unreasonable

  - Evidence of compliance with custom is some evidence of the lack of an opportunity to learn of other precautions

    - Demonstrates a party's opportunity to learn what is feasible and normal as well

  - In certain instances custom = coordinating function

    - Victims are aware of the custom, what is typical

    - Non-compliance may show negligence if the plaintiff can also show that the defendant knew that the victims were relying on adherence to the custom

    - Compliance shows that took the precautions that victims should anticipate, so it's reasonable and the plaintiff is the outlier

  - One could argue that departure from custom is perhaps more probative than evidence of compliance

    - An entire industry may be negligent, but it would be rare for an entire industry to exercise more caution than what is reasonable

    - So therefore, maybe privilege evidence of departure over evidence of compliance?

# Medical malpractice

- Current Rule: The relevant standard is 'custom' and compliance is generally safe harbor, while failure to comply is malpractice

  - Burdens:

    - Plaintiff needs to show evidence that behavior of the professional deviated from the norm

    - Defendant needs to prove that he complied with the professional standard

  - Minority Rules

    - A general reasonableness standard

    - Two Schools of thought approach (pretty commonly allowed)

- Justifications

  - Necessity: Subject of scrutiny is normally incredibly complex -- technical accounting methodologies, medical judgment, etc

    - What you're essentially asking a jury to do, in medical malpractice cases, is give their medical judgment, which they're really not qualified to do absent adherence to a professional standard of conduct

  - Deference/solicitude to professionals as a class, of which appellate judges are members

- Not that different than ordinary cases?

  - Expert testimony generally doesn't point to a precise way that it should be done every time

  - Instead, both sides bring in expert witnesses, who testify about what they would have done

    - Often, this could be interpreted to trigger the "two schools" rule

    - Some courts though might say that the conflict is actually about what the majority standard really is, not argument for a different one

  - Juries may be giving less consideration to the "two schools" rule than they should though

# Duty to warn + products liability

- Warnings can serve on or both of two functions: 1) providing instructions as to how to use a product safely, and 2) giving consumers information about the unavoidable risks posed by a product so that they can decide whether to take these risks

- Law regarding instructions is straightforward

  - Reasonable instructions must be provided

- Complicated though: what about unavoidable risks

  - Impossible to provide purchasers with complete information about risks and liabilities

  - Some product designs are defective even after fully warned, so complete consumer choice can't completely displace mandatory product liability

- Justifications

  - Both feasible and normatively desirable to transfer risk-utility information to the purchaser

  - Cheapest cost avoider

- Example: duty to warn of users about pharmaceutical side effects

  - Aspirin, for example -- small number of users will develop ulcers after prolonged use; apparently nothing you can do about it

  - So aspirin warns you up front, and it's on you to decide whether or not you want to take anyway

  - Aspirin maker discharges liability by warning

- Issues

  - Diminishing returns from additional Information

    - More warnings are given, the less likely an individual is to heed any individual one -- harder to digest, seems so remote

    - "Label clutter"

    - But adequacy issue is normally left to jury to decide, so low-probability outcome may occur and jury will decide should have had it anyway, or that wasn't specific enough

  - Causation

    - Must prove that plaintiff would not have used the product, or would not have used it in the way that it was used, had the alternative warning been given

    - Drugs always an issue: how can you provide evidence that the patient would / wouldn't have taken it with the other label. Defendant has duty to discharge

    - Courts have presumption that the plaintiff would have heeded an adequate drug warning had it been give

# Loss of chance

- Current Rule: Harm is redefined as lost chance of survival rather than death, compensated for change in likelihood of survival

  - Limited to medical context and even within that

    - Only applies where likelihood of survival less than 50% even without negligent action;

    - Only applies when patient dies

- Justification

  - Gets you around lack of but for causation to permit recovery

  - For confining to medical context:

    - Statistical data on survival rates in medical cases but not in other contexts

    - Limiting to medical context avoids case-by-case basis whether it should apply across the board

    - Health providers undertake to maximize patients patient's chance of survival and failure to do so should be actionable

      - Ordinary negligent actors do not undertake such duties

    - If doctors' not potentially liable insufficient legal incentives to exercise care with patients suffering probably-fatal conditions

      - Counter: already have lots of non-legal incentives

      - Counter: why not apply everywhere if deterrence is the motivation

- Issues

  - Many examples in which a D's N causes P to lose a chance but there is no recovery

    - e.g. pest control company negligently fails to find insects in a house with less than 50 percent chance of avoiding infestation even if discovered)

- Proposed reform:

  - Policy: but why not the rate? Taking from 20% to 10% (Halves chance of survival) is much worse than 40% to 30%! But same amount of money

# Market share liability

- *Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories*: Class action. Women whose mothers had taken the drug while they were pregnant. Issue is that no one can figure out which drug they took, even though all making the same, chemically identical, product

  - Court's solution: "Market-share liability," plaintiff could recover from each drug company \$ amount equivalent to the company's market share

  - So if I have \$100 worth of damages and Abbott had 60% of the market, can recover \$6 without proving Abbott individually manufactured the drug that injured me

  - This way, Abbott, who it is established in aggregate did harm equivalent to its market share of DES (this drug that hurt people), can't escape liability simply because each individual plaintiff cannot prove that it made the specific dose she ingested

- Justifications

  - Optimal for deterrence and plaintiff recovery

- Criticism

  - Corrective justice not well-served; plaintiff doesn't get a chance to recover from the specific defendant that injured her

- Limitations

  - [Diseases have multiple causes]{.underline}

    - If I have X disease, there are a number of different toxins or whatever that could have caused it, each with a number of different defendants

    - In *Sindell*, there was a signature disease with one drug that worked, so didn't have this issue

    - So no market-share liability for asbestos, lead-based paint, etc

  - [Products in same market aren't always fungible]{.underline}

    - *Skipworth v. Lead Industries Associates*(Pa. 1997): court refused to apply market-share liability to manufacturers of a lead pigment that was in the past used in house paint, in part because different pigments had different chemical formations. Because these pigments therefore resulted in different levels of bioavailability, different manufacturers didn't necessarily cause harm in proportion to their market share

  - [Relevant market share data isn't always available]{.underline}

    - If harm was actually incurred say, 20 years ago, relevant market share data might not be available

    - Which market share? State? Local? National?

    - What if the defendant can prove it never sold drugs in a given state, so 100% not responsible?

  - [Not feasible to sue all possible defendants]{.underline}

    - Some have gone out of business, others not subject to jurisdiction, so result is that recovering from smaller pool

- Relative market-share approach used in *Sindell*, but later discarded: so sue a substantial portion of the market, have them collectively responsible for the remainder

  - So if 5 companies each had 20%, one of them is bankrupt, plaintiff [still]{.underline} gets full recovery

- Absolute market share approach also a possibility, but then, like joint and several liability issues, it is the plaintiff who is bearing the burden of insolvency

  - Minimum threshold of market available to sue before allowing?

- Purpose is to say that while theoretically appealing, substantial practical limitations, so the market-share liability method is not a panacea

  - Only half of the fifteen states that have addressed the issue have allowed it for DES cases specifically

  - Number of those courts rejected outright

  - Minority have applied to other products

# Pure Economic harm

- Current rule: plaintiff cannot recover if suffered "pure" economic harm (i.e. no physical harm etc.)

# Pure Emotional harm

# Punitive damages

# Compensatory damages

# Statutory damages

# Strict liability

- Current rule: actor bears cost of all harms

- Alternative: negligence liability

# Negligence

- Current rule: actor bears cost of only those harms negligently caused

- Alternative: strict liability

# Duty to rescue

- Current rule: no duty to rescue unless caused harm or special relationship

- Alternative: duty to rescue; Good Samaritan laws

# Class actions

# MDLs

# Trespass

# Nuisance

# Contributory negligence

- Current rule: if plaintiff is at all negligent, no recovery

- Alternative rule: comparative negligence, plaintiff's recovery reduced by amount of own negligence

# Comparative negligence

- Current rule: plaintiff's recovery reduced by amount of own negligence

- Alternative rule: contributory negligence, no recovery if plaintiff is at all negligent

# Informed Consent

- Current rule: doctor must provide patient with information re treatment's risks and benefits, so the patient may make informed choice about whether to take the risks of submitting to the treatment, to seek alternative treatment, or to select no treatment at all.

# Multiple sufficient causes

# Multiple necessary causes

**Doctrine discussion**

- Alternative liability

  - Use burden-shifting more! So useful

- New Zealand

  - There are literally no personally injury suits - just a big fund

  - No deterrence component, purely distributional - but this makes for accidents!

- Jury reform

  - Ford did a BPL for Pinto - jury freaked out and hated it

    - When writing issue spotter - "we may not want to present to jury results of this"

  - Increase use of experts, or "court-appointed special masters"

- Lost chance

  - Why not [rate]{.underline} increase?

- Moral luck

- Market share liability

  - When to use

    - Disease with a single cause: If multiple potential causes, universe of potential defendants to be held liable no longer limited to XYZ manufacturers

    - Fungible products: If the same pill/product has different likelihood of causing injury, proportional responsibility no longer makes sense

    - Relevant market share data available: Which market? What time period? Different defendants in different markets at different times

    - Most defendants can be held liable: Some manufacturers may be bankrupt, tough to reach for jurisdictional reasons, etc

- "Foreseeability"

  - Kinda runs through all of torts - this is how we determine whether someone was negligent (P in BPL) but also whether something was proximate cause

  - Doesn't it mush together...

- Custom

  - Normative force -- "Definitionally, 'reasonableness' is what everyone else in my position does, and I did that"

    - Based on experience and authority that comes from a widespread way of doing things, custom may be probative of what constitutes reasonable care

    - Holding someone liable for doing what everyone else does seems unfair

    - That said, want to demonstrate that the custom is actually justified on the merits, rather than just asserted based on authority

  - Proper cost-benefit analysis, etc

    - Admitting evidence of compliance with custom cautions the jury that if it finds that an actor was negligent despite compliance with the custom, the jury is holding [everyone]{.underline} in that industry negligent

    - Inverse: if defendant wasn't in compliance with the industry standard, he's an outsider and that seems unreasonable

  - Evidence of compliance with custom is some evidence of the lack of an opportunity to learn of other precautions

    - Demonstrates a party's opportunity to learn what is feasible and normal as well

  - In certain instances custom = coordinating function

    - Victims are aware of the custom, what is typical

    - Compliance shows that took the precautions that victims should anticipate, so it's reasonable and the plaintiff is the outlier

  - One could argue that departure from custom is perhaps more probative than evidence of compliance

    - An entire industry may be negligent, but it would be rare for an entire industry to exercise more caution than what is reasonable

    - So therefore, maybe privilege evidence of departure over evidence of compliance?

  - However, sometimes not exercising less caution, but just different caution

    - Sub-conformity vs. non-conformity

  - Finally, legal system has an interest in promoting reliable and accurate decisions about whether conduct is or is not negligent

    - Trial with no evidence about how others engage in the same activity as the defendant would be curiously devoid of information that would be relevant for making a decision in almost any context

    - The first thing we do, usually, when trying to learn something is to figure out how everyone else does is

  - In complex, technical industries, juries need more and more information and context to evaluate "reasonableness"

    - In the 19^th^-century, simple farming accident is easy

    - Car accidents are similar today

    - But say, determining whether someone was negligent in operating a semiconductor fab, need to know what other people would do
