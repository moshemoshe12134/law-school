1.  **Judge or jury?**

    a.  Holmes and Cardozo illustrative

        i.  Holmes, in *[Goodman]{.underline}*, envisioned a system of tort law in negligent as a "matter of law." Train case, guy run down. Holmes says standard of conduct is clear, no reason for jury

        ii. Cardozo, in *[Pokora]{.underline}*, comes to opposite conclusion in similar case and overrules: "standards of conduct are declared at time by courts, but taken from facts of life"

    b.  Tort law has evolved to follow Cardozo's view more than it has Holmes' -- courts have concluded that reasonable people could consider the factual variations between cases like *[Goodman]{.underline}* and *[Pokora]{.underline}* sufficiently important enough to permit different outcomes

Less politically dangerous to pass things to juries, and most torts are state-level, where many judges are elected

|         i.  Injured parties are systematically over-rewarded at the expense of non-injured parties who were "injured" via increase in risk of injury |

|                 a.  Theoretically each is liable separately, but practically we can't determine who committed which specific part of the injury                                              |

|              1.  Fairness: Allow plaintiff full recovery, force defendants to bear risk of potential inability to pay (ie, if anyone defaults, plaintiff can go to others to get rest of \$) |
|                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|              2.  Ease of administration: Plaintiff doesn't have to prove specific damages from each defendant where theoretically or practically impossible to do so                         |
|                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 3.  **Market share liability: Drugs?**                                                                                                                                                       |
|                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|     a.  *Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories*: Mom took drugs many years ago, daughter now sick. But many different manufacturers, all making the same thing. Which one made this pill?           |
|                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|     b.  **When to use?**                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|         i.  Disease with a single cause: If multiple potential causes, universe of potential defendants to be held liable no longer limited to XYZ manufacturers                             |
|                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|         ii. Fungible products: If the same pill/product has different likelihood of causing injury, proportional responsibility no longer makes sense                                        |
|                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|         iii. Relevant market share data available: Which market? What time period? Different defendants in different markets at different times                                              |
|                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|         iv. Most defendants can be held liable: Some manufacturers may be bankrupt, tough to reach for jurisdictional reasons, etc                                                           |
|                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|     c.  **How does it work?**                                                                                                                                                                |
|                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|         i.  Each plaintiff can recover from each drug company \$ equivalent to the company's market share                                                                                    |
|                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|         ii. But different tweaks: relative liability or absolute liability (who bears burden for insolvency?)                                                                                |
|                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|         iii. Can the defendant discharge liability by providing evidence that it was not responsible for any particular incident? (*Hymowitz*: no!)                                          |
|                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|     d.  **Policy: Why use it?**                                                                                                                                                              |
|                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|         i.  Asymmetric information: Defendant has little/no chance of proving individual culpability                                                                                         |
|                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|         ii. Fairness: We know there was **a** harm committed, even if not to this individual plaintiff                                                                                       |
|                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|         iii. Ability to pay: Corporation better position to pay for medical expenses than individual                                                                                         |

|         i.  Example: Defendant fails to stop at a red light, collides with the defendant's vehicle. He's clearly *negligent*, his failure to stop is a *cause in fact* of the accident, the plaintiff suffered harm, but were his actions the *proximate cause* of the injury? |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|                 a.  Parking next to the hydrant rather than 12 feet further down the street could prevent firefighters from getting access to the hydrant                                                                                                                      |
